INTRODUCTION \n1.  The governments of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nMyanmar  have  requested  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support malaria elimination efforts and communicable diseases \ncontrol  (CDC)  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS).  The  request,  made  through  the \nministries of health (MOHs), asked that the TA focus on developing a comprehensive approach \nto drug-resistant malaria in Myanmar, and on improving regional cooperation on malaria and \nCDC  across  the  GMS.  This  proposed TA  program  has  been  developed  through  an  initial \nconsultation in Bangkok, Thailand, which took place in July 2014, and subsequent fact-finding \nmissions conducted in 2014 and 2015. During the missions, the governments of Cambodia, the \nLao PDR, and Myanmar (CLM) and ADB agreed on the TA impact, outcome, implementation \narrangements, costs and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Multidrug-resistant malaria. The spread of multidrug-resistant malaria is jeopardizing \nthe remarkable progress made in malaria control since 2000 in the GMS countries and globally. \nResistance to artemisinin was initially found in 2008 in western Cambodia and has since been \ndetected in the Lao PDR and Myanmar. Resistance has spread to therapies combining several \ndrugs. Over 120 million people in the GMS are at risk of contracting malaria annually.2 The \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that malaria elimination in the GMS is now the \nonly way to address the threat of drug resistance and prevent the loss of the most potent \nfrontline treatments for malaria. The WHO estimates that the cost of eliminating malaria in the \nsubregion will range from $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion over 15 years. This represents an average \nof $1.8\u2013$2.2 per capita for the population at risk and is expected to yield cost savings and social \nbenefits of up to $9 for each $1 invested.3 To effectively eliminate malaria, it is critical to improve \npatient  diagnosis,  adherence  to  and  follow-up  of  treatment,  and  to  move  rapidly  towards \nelimination while the tools for treatment remain effective. \n \n3.  Malaria and communicable disease control in Myanmar. Myanmar has the highest \nincidence of malaria in the GMS and one of the least-developed programs for malaria care. It \nrepresents the largest and most difficult environment for malaria elimination in the subregion. \nThe government identified three major key constraints: (i) undeveloped disease surveillance \nsystems; (ii) inadequate quality assurance systems for malaria diagnostic in laboratories; and (iii) \nlarge populations currently underserved by the public health system. Myanmar will need to \nimprove in each of these areas before a malaria elimination strategy is implemented nationwide. \n \n4.  Migrant and mobile populations. Migrant and mobile populations (MMPs) are a key \nrisk group for malaria because they are often (i) more exposed to disease vectors, and (ii) out of \nreach of the health system. In addition, MMPs contribute to malaria-spreading as they move \nbetween regions and mosquito populations. This is facilitated by economic corridors contributing \nto mobility increase within the six GMS countries. In 2009, the Mekong Migration Network \nestimated that the GMS was home to 3 million\u20135 million migrants.4 This mobility is expected to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2015. \n2  W.

In  order  to  achieve  elimination,  national  malaria  programs  must  engage  specific \nstrategies to reach these populations with prevention and treatment. \n \n5.  Regional  coordination.  The  increase  in  migration  and  the  spread  of  multidrug \nresistance  must  be  addressed  through  improved  regional  coordination.  Despite  significant \ninvestments  in  malaria  control  and  the  recognition  that  malaria  is  not  limited  by  national \nboundaries, there is still limited data-sharing across borders in key outbreak scenarios, and \nhigh-level  political  barriers  to  cross-border  treatment  remain.  Eliminating  malaria  from  the \nsubregion  will  fail  if  countries  do  not  have  the  data  and  agreements  to  address  malaria \ntransmission across borders. Improving coordination across countries to address these gaps is \na prerequisite for achieving elimination. \n \n6.  Governments\u2019 strategy. In 2014, heads of governments at the Ninth East Asia Summit \nagreed to the historic goal of an Asia and Pacific region free of malaria by 2030. This requires a \nsignificant increase in investments so that national malaria control programs can implement \neffective elimination strategies. Every country in the GMS has developed a plan for malaria \nelimination. The proposed TA activities have been identified in collaboration with the national \nmalaria programs and WHO technical advice, to complement the other development partners\u2019 \nengagement and, in particular, the assistance of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \nand Malaria. \n \n7.  ADB assistance. Since 2006, ADB has supported several CDC projects in the GMS, \nwhich have fostered regional cooperation on disease control, promoted information exchanges \nbetween countries and adjacent provinces, strengthened the diagnostic capacity and disease \nsurveillance and response systems at provincial level, and developed staff capacity.5 Lessons \nlearned from those projects show that progress need to be made in (i) targeting vulnerable \ngroups, in particular MMPs; (ii) strengthening diagnostic and treatment capacity in the remote \ndistricts; (iii) improving diseases surveillance and rapid response to epidemics; and (iv) involving \nprivate sector in the delivery of health services targeting vulnerable groups. The proposed TA \nwill focus on those gaps and will complement the additional financing grant for ADB\u2019s Second \nGreater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Control (CDC2) Project (footnote \n5), which focuses on supporting malaria elimination in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. \nThe TA will coordinate with the existing regional HIV/AIDS project in the Lao PDR and with the \ncapacity building for HIV/AIDS grant in Myanmar.6 ADB\u2019s $125 million loan for the GMS Health \nSecurity Project, scheduled to start at the end of 2016, will complement and streamline the ADB \nCDC engagement in the GMS, summarized in the Supplementary Appendix. The TA is in line \nwith (i) the midterm review of the ADB Strategy 2020 which recommends expanding operations \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2005.

The TA concept paper was approved by the ADB Management \non 6 July 2015. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operation business plan for Myanmar, \n2015\u20132017.10 It builds on malaria elimination efforts that ADB has carried out in the region, and \nit will coordinate closely with these investments, including the Asia\u2013Pacific Leaders Malaria \nAlliance, which was established at the East Asia Summit in 2012, and which ADB hosts. The \nproposed  intervention  modality  will  allow  a  swift  inclusion  of  Myanmar  in  the  regional \ncoordination, a timely use of the available grant resources and a good linkage between current \nor past TA and grant interventions and the GMS Health Security loan in preparation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The impacts will be (i) malaria eliminated across Cambodia by 2025 (aligned with the \nNational Malaria Control Program, National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria \nControl); (ii) malaria fully eliminated in the Lao PDR by 2030 (aligned with the National Strategy \nfor Malaria Control and Elimination); and (iii) malaria fully eliminated in Myanmar by 2030 \n(aligned with National Comprehensive Development Plan, Health Sector 2011\u20132012 to 2030\u2013\n2031).  The  outcome  will  be  national  malaria  and  CDC  programs  strengthened  and  better \ncoordinated  in  CLM.  To  reach  the  impacts,  the  TA  will  be  complemented  by  future  ADB \nengagement in health security in the GMS and by the engagement of other donors, principally \nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs  designed  to  address  gaps  in  combating  multidrug \nresistance and improving national  malaria programs: (i) Myanmar malaria surveillance and \ndiagnostic systems improved, (ii) MMPs\u2019 specific needs for malaria prevention and treatment \naddressed,  and  (iii)  regional  coordination  on  malaria  and  CDC  among  GMS  countries \nstrengthened. Each has been identified by the MOHs in CLM as a key gap in need of support.  \nEach workstream will contribute directly to the national malaria programs and play a critical role \nin malaria elimination in each country. \n \n10.  Myanmar  malaria  surveillance  and  diagnostic  systems  improved.  The  TA  will \nstrengthen the Myanmar MOH national surveillance system through (i) a review and update of \nnational malaria surveillance guidelines (in coordination with the MOH, donors, nongovernment \norganizations [NGOs], and private health care providers); (ii) the provision of software and \nhardware  equipment  to  the  National  Malaria  Control  Program;  (iii)  the  development  of \nmonitoring tools and training manuals for strengthened surveillance systems; (iv) the design and \nimplementation of a unified malaria surveillance system and national operating procedures; (v) \nthe training of the National Malaria Control Program staff; and (vi) the implementation of the \nimproved national system in at least two regions and five townships. The TA will improve the \nnational quality assurance program for malaria diagnosis in Myanmar through (i) the update of \nthe national guidelines on malaria diagnostic quality assurance; (ii) the design of enhanced \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

MMPs\u2019 specific needs for malaria prevention and treatment addressed. The TA will \nsupport pilot efforts to reach MMPs in private sector projects in Myanmar, and in neighboring \nprovinces in Cambodia and the Lao PDR. For Myanmar, specific activities will cover (i) the \nmapping of private sector efforts in the chosen endemic areas, (ii) the establishment of malaria \nservices at trial sites, and (iii) the evaluation of pilots to draw lessons for scale-up and broader \naccess to medical care for MMPs in private sector projects. Innovative approaches will consider \nwomen\u2019s and ethnic minority issues. Cross-border malaria prevention and treatment program for \nMMPs  in  the  Cambodia\u2013Lao  PDR  border  will  be  designed  and  implemented  based  on  a \nmapping of MMPs\u2019 risks and vulnerabilities to malaria and other relevant health threats, and \ntheir access to services both public and private. \n \n12.  Regional coordination on malaria and CDC among GMS countries strengthened. \nThe TA will build on regional cooperation mechanisms and the regional coordination unit (RCU) \nalready established under the CDC2 Project (footnote 5) to (i) reinforce the mechanisms for \ncross-border information sharing on malaria and communicable disease outbreaks, and the \nmechanisms for cross-border treatment through high-level policy agreements; (ii) provide TA to \nmalaria programs in implementing these cross-border treatment and data sharing plans; and (iii) \ndevelop cross-border action plans for MMPs to be endorsed and adopted by CLM MOHs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,700,000, of which $4,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund11 under \nthe Health Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The governments of CLM \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of office space, salaries of implementation agency \nstaff, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the TA will be implemented from 1 October 2015 \nto 30 June 2017. The implementing agency in each of the project countries will be (i) MOH\u2019s \nCDC Department, National Center for Parasitology Entomology and Malaria Control (Cambodia); \n(ii)  MOH\u2019s  Department  of  Planning  and  International  Cooperation  and  CDC  Department, \nNational Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology, National Center of Malariology, Parasitology, \nand Entomology (Lao PDR); and (iii) MOH\u2019s CDC Department, including the National Malaria \nControl Program (Myanmar).  \n \n15.  The capacity of implementing agencies is adequate to implement the TA. There are no \nfunds to be  delegated to the governments  of Cambodia  and  Myanmar  as  part  of  the TA \nimplementation arrangements. In the Lao PDR, an advance payment facility will be provided to \nthe implementing agency, which has a successful track record of administering ADB funded \nprojects. The advance payment facility will finance the administrative costs of the RCU (footnote \n5), including maintenance of the existing GMS CDC web portal. \n                                                \n11 Financing partners: the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom. \n ", "  5 \n16.  ADB will recruit several international NGOs to execute the TA activities from November \n2015 to June 2017: (i) development and rollout of the malaria program surveillance system, \nmalaria data collection, reporting, and analysis in Myanmar ($850,000); (ii) development and \nrollout of laboratory quality assurance control for malaria-testing in Myanmar ($1,000,000); (iii) \nidentification of needs and service delivery for MMPs in private sector projects in Myanmar \n($750,000); and (iv) identification of needs and service delivery for MMPs in the Cambodia\u2013Lao \nPDR border provinces ($650,000). NGOs will be recruited following fixed-budget selection using \nsimplified technical proposal procedures because the terms of reference are precisely defined \nand the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded. In addition, the TA will hire three individual \nconsultants to provide TA to the implementing agencies and support overall TA coordination: (i) \none  regional  coordinator  (international,  21  person-months),  (ii)  public  health  specialist \n(international, 18 person-months), and (iii) a knowledge management specialist (national, 18 \nperson-months). Flexibility to mobilize expertise as required will be provided by determining the \nterms of reference and selection method during TA implementation for 6 person-months of \ninternational, and 15 person-months of national consulting services, possibly in the areas of \nmalaria  elimination,  quality  assurance,  disease  surveillance,  MMPs,  and  procurement  and \nfinance. The TA will also mobilize short-term resource persons to provide specific expertise on \nsurveillance, quality assurance and MMPs. All international NGOs and individual consultants will \nbe hired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Advance action for consultant selection and recruitment is proposed to avoid \ninitial start-up delay. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  Equipment  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The international NGOs contracted by ADB \nwill act as procurement agent and will conduct all procurement procedures on behalf of the \ngovernment  in  consultation  with  the  implementing  agency.  The  implementing  agency  will \ncontract the winning bidder and purchase the equipment. The suppliers will be paid through the \ndirect payment procedure by ADB. All equipment procured under the TA will be retained by the \nimplementing agencies on completion of the TA. The implementing agency in the Lao PDR will \nbe provided with an advance payment facility to finance the recurrent costs of the RCU. Funds \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The RCU will coordinate regional conferences and cross-\nborder activities and maintain the existing CDC2 Project web portal. The international NGOs will \nsupport the organization of conferences in Myanmar and the participation of Myanmar delegates \nto regional conferences. \n \n18.  Knowledge products, such as mapping results of MMPs malaria needs in private sector \nsettings and in border areas, reinforcing malaria surveillance systems, and standardizing quality \nassurance protocols for malaria diagnostics in the GMS, will be developed and shared with \nrelevant stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n19.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $4,500,000 to the governments of Cambodia, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Myanmar to be financed  on a grant basis by the \nRegional  Malaria  and  Other  Communicable  Disease  Threats Trust  Fund  under the  Health \nFinancing Partnership Facility for Malaria and Communicable Diseases Control in the Greater \nMekong Subregion. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Technical Assistance is Aligned With \nMalaria eliminated across Cambodia by 2025 (National Malaria Control Program, National Centre for Parasitology, \nEntomology and Malaria Control); \nMalaria fully eliminated in the Lao PDR by 2030 (National Strategy for Malaria Control and Elimination\u2014East Asia \nSummit Statement 2014); and \nMalaria fully eliminated in Myanmar by 2030 (National Comprehensive Development Plan, Health Sector 2011\u20132012 \nto 2030\u20132031, East Asia Summit Statement 2014). \n \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nNational malaria and  a.
