During the 40th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors in Kyoto, Japan, in May 2007, \nthe Government of Palau requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to prepare a project to develop water supply and sanitation systems on the island of \nBabeldaob. This proposed TA was identified in the 2007\u20132009 country strategy and program \nupdate  (CSPU).  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Palau  6\u201313  June  2007,  during  which \nconsultations were held with the Government to determine the nature and scope of the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  the  proposed  financing.  The  PPTA  will  be \ncomprised of two components: (i) preparation of a water supply sector development plan for \nBabeldaob and Koror State, and (ii) preparation of feasibility studies to improve the security of \nthe treated water supply to communities on Babeldaob and within the state of Koror, and to \nenable the expansion of the Koror-Airai water supply network to the state of Aimeliik. An \nunderstanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants, \nas reflected in the Memorandum of Understanding of the Fact-Finding Mission.1\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  With the exception of the water supply for Koror and Airai, Palau\u2019s water supply systems \nare operated and maintained by state governments. The Koror-Airai water supply is operated \nand maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD) and supplies water to approximately \n64% of the country's population. Based on 2005 census data, the population of Palau is growing \nannually at about 1.4%. However, the proportion of the population living in the Koror-Airai urban \narea has declined from 71% in 1995 to 64% in 2005. This decline may be attributed to the \nconstruction  of  Compact  Road,  which  has  allowed  customary  landowners  in  Babeldaob \nimproved access to their land, facilitating agriculture and other economic developments. \n \n3.  A goal of the proposed National Policy on Population and Sustainable Development2 is \n\"to stimulate controlled economic development in balance with the carrying capacities of Palau\u2019s \nenvironment and infrastructure,\" which is consistent with the third element of ADB's strategic \nfocus  for  assistance  to  Palau,  \"[to]  facilitate  sound  infrastructure  development  and \nmanagement.\"3  Currently,  Palau\u2019s  water  policy  is  contained  within  existing  water  supply \nlegislation, and draft legislation is now being prepared for the protection of watersheds. \n \n4.  The Government finances the operation, maintenance, and the capital costs for water \nsupplies. Currently, charges exist for water supplied through the PWD-operated network that \nservices the Koror-Airai area. This network is metered; however, the water rate for customers \nliving within the states of Airai is fixed at $5.00 per month as water for this supply system is \nsolely derived from within Airai. Customers within Koror are charged $0.85 per 1,000 gallons. \nWater supply systems operated by state governments are not metered, and a monthly flat rate \nfee for water usage is charged by the various states.  \n \n5.  The Government is considering legislation to take over responsibility for the operation of \nall public water supply and sewerage systems in Palau. If the proposed legislation is passed, \neither  a  new  public  infrastructure  ministry  or  a  state-owned  water  supply  and  sewerage \ncorporation would be formed and would be responsible for national water supply and sewerage \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 July 2007. \n2 Government of Palau. 2007. National Policy on Population and Sustainable Development. Koror. \n3 ADB. 2006. Palau (2007\u20132009) Country Strategy and Program Update. Manila. \n ", "2   \noperations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  also  expressed  a  desire  to  privatize  water  and \nsewerage services. Revenues obtained through water rates do not cover the water supply\u2019s \noperation, maintenance, and capital costs, and changes to the existing tariff structure may be \nrequired to allow full recovery of these costs with transparency. Without full cost recovery, water \nsupply and sewerage operations will not be sustainable. \n \n6.  The PWD reports that approximately 50% of water produced for the Koror-Airai water \nsupply cannot be accounted for, and the PWD believes that illegal connections are the major \ncause. The rate of arrears is also high, accounting for 1.8 months of average water rates \nrevenue. The existing water supply legislation does not provide the PWD with the authority to \ndisconnect  consumers  with  accounts  in  arrears  or  to  penalize  consumers  with  illegal \nconnections. \n \n7.  The  PWD  reports  that  average  per  capita  water  consumption  for  piped  water  is \napproximately 200 gallons per person per day and is likely to increase. Currently, the daily \ndemand for the Koror-Airai water supply system is 4 million gallons per day. Water for this \nsystem is abstracted from a reservoir with a capacity of 20 million gallons and from the Ngerikill \nRiver, located in Airai. Disruptions to the water supply, affecting approximately 14,000 people, \nare experienced during severe droughts, as in 1983 and 1997. The Government is concerned \nthat the frequency of severe droughts may increase due to climate change, and it has identified \na need to improve security of supply to the Koror-Airai area. \n \n8.  With the opening of the Compact Road, demand for residential and agricultural lots on \nBabeldaob, particularly in Aimeliik, is increasing. A limited secure water supply is constraining \ndevelopment on Babeldaob, and new water sources and expanded water supply networks on \nBabeldaob  must  be  developed.  The  Government  is  considering  the  establishment  of  an \ninterlinked water supply network for Babeldaob to facilitate development and has identified the \nexpansion of the Koror-Airai network to Aimeliik as a high priority. The Government proposes \nconstructing a bulk water supply main following the Compact Road from the Shell gas station in \nAirai to Aimeliik/Ngatpang Cross Road, a distance of approximately 6 miles. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  PPTA  will  be  secure,  reliable,  and  affordable  water  supplies  to \ncommunities on Babeldaob and in Koror. The outcome will be sustainable management of the \nnational water supply system and improved reliability and security of the water supply to Koror. \nThe PPTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The PPTA will be comprised of two components: (i) preparation of a water supply sector \ndevelopment plan for Babeldaob and Koror State; and (ii) preparation of feasibility studies to \nimprove the security of supply of treated water to communities in Babeldaob and Koror, and to \nenable the expansion of the Koror-Airai water supply network to Aimeliik. \n \n11.  Component 1: Preparation of Palau\u2019s Water Supply Sector Development Plan. A \nwater supply sector development plan focusing on water supply services to communities on \nBabeldaob and in Koror will be prepared. The sector development plan will (i) provide an ", "  3\nanalysis  of  existing  demand  and  demand  forecasts  for    the  period  2008\u20132020  for  high-, \nmedium-, and low-demand growth scenarios; (ii) assess the condition of existing water supply \nassets and the level of service currently provided to consumers, including reliability, quality, and \naffordability,  and  provide  a  financial  analysis  and  assessment  of  the  PWD-provided  water \nsupply services; (iii) create a least-cost investment plan for the period 2008\u20132020 to provide \ncommunities on Babeldaob and in Koror with safe, reliable, and affordable water supplies; (iv) \nassess  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  the  investment  plan,  and  recommend \nmeasures to build project implementation capacity; (v) assess the procurement systems and \nprocedures  currently  used  by  the  Government;  (vi)  in  consultation  with  key  stakeholders, \nincluding the Government, nongovernment organizations, and community service organizations, \nidentify options for institutional reforms to the PWD water supply services, develop a plan to \nimplement  the  institutional  reforms  within  a  3-year  period,  and  determine  the  physical, \ninstitutional, and human resources requirements and tariff structure to meet the objective of a \nsafe, reliable, and affordable water supply while providing cost recovery by 2013; and (vii) \nidentify amendments necessary to existing water supply legislation to enable the corporatization \nof PWD water supply services and to facilitate effective management of water supplies. \n \n12.  The first component will also include a survey to assess the willingness of various \nconsumer groups, particularly the poor on Babeldaob and in Koror, to pay for improved water \nsupply services.4 A community awareness campaign promoting responsible use of water and \nhighlighting the need for realistic water rates will also be undertaken. \n \n13.  Component  2:  Water  Source  and  Bulk  Supply  Main  Feasibility  Studies.  Two \nfeasibility studies, including preliminary designs, will be prepared. The feasibility studies will \nprovide the basis for an investment project. \n \n14.  Feasibility Study A will identify secure sources of water within Aimeliik to initially yield  \n1 million gallons of potable water per day with the potential to expand the production to 2 million \ngallons per day. The study will assess suitable sites for the intake works, water treatment plant, \nand  alignments  for  an  access  road  and  water  mains,  e.g.,  raw  water  and  clear  water.5  \nCost-effective water treatment options, suitable for application in Palau, will be identified and \nassessed. A working paper presenting the study\u2019s findings and recommendations, including \npreliminary  project  cost  estimates,  will  be  submitted  to  the  Government  for  consideration. \nFollowing the Government\u2019s consideration and agreement on a preferred option, preliminary \ndesigns of the treatment process, intake structure, water treatment plant, water mains and \nassociated infrastructure, and access roads will be prepared. Environmental and social impacts \nwill be assessed, and an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and a land acquisition and \nresettlement plan (LARP) will be prepared according to the requirements and approval of the \nGovernment and ADB. Project cost estimates will also be refined. The preliminary designs, \napproved EIA and LARP, and cost estimates will be presented in the studies\u2019 final report. Initial \nexamination of flow-gauging data collected by the United States Geological Survey indicates \nthat the Tabecheding River, in Aimeliik, may be a suitable water source. \n \n15.  Feasibility Study B will identify and assess options to convey up to 1 million gallons of \ntreated water from the proposed water treatment plant in Aimeliik, as outlined above, to the \nexisting Koror-Airai water supply network. The study will assess options to minimize operation \n                                                 \n4 The Government of Palau conducted a household income and expenditure survey (HIES) during 2007. A report \npresenting the survey data and data analysis is expected to be available by October 2007. \n5 The raw water mains will convey untreated water from the intake works to the proposed water treatment plant. The \nclear water mains will convey treated water from the water treatment plant to the Compact Road. \n ", "4   \ncost, including the potential to construct a high-level, clear water service reservoir to maximize \nthe potential in conveying water between Aimeliik and Airai by gravity feed. The study will \nidentify  suitable  pipeline  sizes  and  materials,  as  well  as  horizontal  and  vertical  pipeline \nalignment options, to minimize the cost of conveying water between Aimeliik and Airai and land \nacquisition requirements. A working paper presenting the study\u2019s findings and recommendations, \nincluding  preliminary  project  cost  estimates,  will  be  submitted  to  the  Government  for \nconsideration. Following Government consideration and agreement on a preferred option, a \npreliminary  design  of  the  water  main  and  clear  water  service  reservoir  will  be  prepared. \nEnvironmental and social impacts will be assessed, and an EIA and a LARP will be prepared to \nmeet the requirements of and obtain the approval of the Government and ADB. Project cost \nestimates will be refined. The preliminary designs, approved EIA and LARP, and cost estimates \nwill be presented in the studies\u2019 final report. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $875,000, of which $700,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund (JSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will contribute $175,000 in-kind as counterpart funds. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Resources and Development (MRD) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA. A project steering committee, chaired by the Minister for Resources and Development, will \nbe formed to provide overall direction. Other committee members will include the Minister of \nFinance, the Governor of Airai State, the Governor of Aimeliik State, the Director of Capital \nInfrastructure Projects, and the Director of the Environment Quality Protection Board (EQPB) or \ntheir representatives.  \n \n18.  The  PPTA  will  be  implemented  intermittently  over  12  months  and  is  expected  to \ncommence in November 2007 and be completed by 31 December 2008. The total consultant \ninput is estimated at 28.5 person-months, of which 15 person-months will be from international \nconsulting services and 13.5 person-months will be from national consulting services. The \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and will be evaluated using a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The consulting firm will \nnominate the consultants\u2019 team leader. The consultants will have expertise in water supply \ndevelopment, financial and economic analysis, tariff analysis, water supply legislation, social \nanalysis  and  poverty  impact  assessment,  and  environmental  matters.  The  international \nconsulting  services  will  provide  expertise  in  water  supply  development  \n(5 person-months, 3 positions), economic and financial analysis (4 person-months, 2 positions), \npoverty  and  social  development  (1  person-month),  environmental  and  social  safeguards  \n(3 person-months, 2 positions), water supply legislation (1 person-month), and geotechnical \nengineering (1 person-month). The national consulting services will provide expertise in water \nsupply  engineering  (3  person-months),  social  safeguards  (4.5  person-months,  2  positions), \ncommunity awareness (3 person-months), and computer-aided drafting (3 person-months). \n \n19.  Separate reports and working papers will be required for each component. Reporting will \ninclude an inception report that focuses on any necessary changes to the scope of work or work \nprogram, as well as interim, draft final, and final reports. In addition, each consultant will be ", "  5\nrequired to produce draft final reports relevant to their inputs for discussion with the Government, \nADB, and other stakeholders. The final report must be submitted within 1 month of receipt of \ncomments from ADB and the Government. Consultants will also prepare briefing papers for \nperiodic consultation workshops. \n \nIV.

Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe project is directly linked to the third strategic focus in the Palau CSPU 2007\u20132009, \u201cfacilitat[ing] sound infrastructure \ndevelopment and management,\u201d and to a proposed water supply and sanitation project also identified in the CSPU. \n \nThe water supplies within Palau are extremely vulnerable to drought due to limited development of secure water \nresources. Palau\u2019s largest water supply system, which services the Koror-Airai area, has limited capacity as the water is \nsourced from small catchments. Major water supply disruptions were experienced during the 1983 and 1997 El Ni\u00f1o \nevents. The recent construction of Compact Road on Babeldaob has provided many Koror and Airai residents with ready \naccess to their traditional lands. There is a trend for these residents to move to Babeldaob; however, the lack of a \nreliable and safe water supply is constraining development opportunities. \n \nWith the exception of the Koror-Airai water supply system, state governments operate and maintain Palau water \nsupplies. The underfunding of water supply operations and maintenance budgets in most state-operated water supply \nsystems has made most water supplies prone to disruption; in some instances, untreated water is distributed to \nconsumers. \n \nB.
