On 26 October 2005, the Director General of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment (RSDD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) met with senior ministerial officials \nof the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) in Beijing. During the meeting, SEPA requested ADB to provide technical assistance to \nsupport establishing and developing SEPA\u2019s regional supervision centers (RSCs), which are top \npriorities in SEPA\u2019s 11th 5-year plan. SEPA\u2019s proposal for establishing RSCs was approved by \nthe  State  Council  on  20  September  2005.  SEPA  is  planning  to  start  recruiting  staff  and \noperating the RSCs in 2006. In response to the Government\u2019s urgent need, ADB fielded a Fact-\nFinding Mission to Beijing on 14\u201318 November 2005 and held meetings with officials from SEPA \nand the Ministry of Finance. During the discussions, the impact, outcome, outputs and activities, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  of  the \ntechnical assistance (the TA) were confirmed. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   As part of the integrated package of policies, investment, and institutions to enable the \nPRC  to  make  further  progress  towards  achieving  sustainable  development,  the  draft  11th \nnational 5-year plan for environmental protection identifies establishing and developing SEPA\u2019s \nRSCs as a priority to improve the effectiveness of environmental management in the PRC.  \n \n3.  Rapid  economic  development  in  the  past  20  years  and  a  large  and  still  growing \npopulation have persistently placed enormous pressures on the PRC\u2019s environment and natural \nresources. The country\u2019s environmental problems and priorities increasingly correlate with the \ngeographic  pattern  of  social  and  economic  development,  as  the  decentralization  process \ndeepens. For example, the environmental challenges in arid, landlocked rural areas in the \nnorthwest include sustainably using water and forest resources and restoring ecosystems, while \nthe main concerns in heavily populated, industrializing and urbanized eastern coastal provinces \nare  preventing  and  controlling  industrial  and  urban  pollution.  The  increasing  disparity  in \neconomic development and environmental problems across the regions underscores the need \nto  (i)  integrate  environmental  considerations  into  regional  economic  development  decision \nmaking and (ii) generate regional environmental management strategies and institutions.  \n \n4.  It has been recognized that the existing institutional setting and related policies cannot \nmeet emerging challenges. The traditional approach of national programs for the control of \npollution  emphasized  limiting  emissions  or  discharges  firm-by-firm,  but  did  not  sufficiently \naddress  the  importance  of  choices  made  regionally  and  locally  about  land  use  and  its \ndevelopment.  While  SEPA  has  promulgated  various  laws  concerning  pollution  control  and \nnatural resources conservation, institutional and financial arrangements for helping provinces \nand  cities  to  implement  laws  and  programs  has  been  lacking.  As  a  result,  large  gaps  in \nimplementing laws and regulations appear to exist provincially and locally.  \n \n5.  Linkages among entities concerned with environmental management at the different \nlevels  of  government  have  been  weak  regarding  environmental  policymaking  and \nimplementation. Because environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) are branches of provincial, \ncity, and country governments, their budgets and executive appointments are decided by local \ngovernments, not by SEPA. While the EPBs are supposed to control pollution emissions within \ntheir  jurisdictions,  they  are  often  reluctant  to  strictly  enforce  national  regulations,  as  local \ngovernments are more interested in attracting investment to improve their economies.  \n ", "2   \n6.  In addition, the existing SEPA lacks both adequate numbers of professional staff and the \nskills needed to carry out their expanding mandates. While SEPA\u2019s regulatory and enforcement \nrole has expanded exponentially since the 1990s, its workforce of about 2,200 employees (219 \nin SEPA\u2019s administrative staff and about 2,000 staff working at various national offices and \ncenters affiliated to SEPA) is basically unchanged since 1995. The number of SEPA employees \nas a percentage of total population is very low compared to that of environmental protection \nagencies in developed countries. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), \nfor example, has 18,000 employees, the Australian Ministry of Environment 3,000, and the \nCanadian Ministry of Environment 5,000.  \n \n7.  Given  the  huge  territorial  area  of  the  PRC  and  inadequate  numbers  and  skills  of \nprofessional staff, SEPA faces great challenges in managing information regionally and locally, \nfielding its staff, providing technical support and oversight, and responding in a timely way to \ntransjurisdictional environmental issues. The increasing incidence of environmental accidents \nwithout timely response has caused significant economic losses and is typical of weak regional \nenvironmental management capacity. Technically and politically astute environmental managers \nfor regions are urgently needed. \n \n8.  Recognizing these challenges and the need for institutional development and reform, \nSEPA established two RSCs in 2002 on a trial basis. The East Regional Supervision Center is \nassociated with the East PRC Environmental Research Institute located in Nanjing, and the \nSouth Regional Supervision Center is associated with the South PRC Environmental Research \nInstitute located in Guangzhou. However, the development of the two RSCs is still at a very \nearly stage. A recent report by SEPA concluded that the authority and responsibilities of the two \nRSCs have not been clearly defined, and that their staff urgently needs training to be effective.  \n \n9.  In 2000, ADB approved a cluster TA for Transjurisdictional Environmental Management \nin the PRC.1 An important finding of Component B of this TA was a strong recommendation to \nestablish and develop SEPA regional offices to strengthen water-quality management at the \nriver-basin level. This recommendation has reinforced SEPA\u2019s proposal to establish RSCs. \n \n10.  On 20 September 2005, the Office of the Public Service Reform Committee of the State \nCouncil  approved  SEPA\u2019s  proposal  to  establish  three  additional  RSCs\u2014one  each  in  the \nnorthwest with 30 staff positions, the northeast with 30 staff positions, and the southwest with 40 \nstaff positions\u2014to further strengthen SEPA\u2019s institutional capacity and regionalize its structure. \nThe  overall  functions  of  the  RSCs  are  preliminarily  defined  as  supervising,  enforcing, \ncoordinating  environmental  management  and  responding  to  environmental  accidents  and \nincidents. SEPA is planning to start recruiting staff and opening the RSCs in 2006. It has \nbecome increasingly clear how the balance is struck between development and environmental \nconsequences  regionally  and  locally  is  a  fundamental  consideration  for  environmental \nmanagement. The decision to establish SEPA regional offices is an important move, but the \ndecision itself will not automatically solve the problems. The next critical test is whether the \nRSCs  can  be  designed  to  effectively  foster  wise  choices  by  the  local  governments  about \ndevelopment and its environmental consequences. \n \n11.  To  improve  environmental  management  capacity  regionally  in  the  PRC  is  both \ntechnically challenging and administratively contentious. Given the limited experience of SEPA \nin this area, this TA will provide timely and necessary support to help SEPA design and develop \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

This is also in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, \nwhich emphasizes environmental management as an important pillar for achieving sustainable \ndevelopment in the PRC. The experience and lessons drawn from the TA can be also used for \nreference in other Asian countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n12.  The impact of TA will be improved environmental management capacity regionally in the \nPRC. The expected outcome is that SEPA\u2019s RSCs will be established and begin functioning \naccording to the strategic roadmap and institutional development plan developed under TA, and \nthat staff members of SEPA, the RSCs and EPBs will apply the knowledge and skills acquired \nfrom the training conducted under TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.   The main outputs of TA will be  \n(i)   a strategic roadmap for the RSCs\u2019 establishment and development (the strategic \nroadmap);  \n(ii)   an institutional development plan for establishing the RSCs;  \n(iii)   better understanding of regional environmental management issues and gained \nknowledge and skills to staff members of SEPA, the RSCs, and local EPBs \nregarding regional environmental management; and  \n(iv)   a policy proposal to be submitted to the State Council recommending policy \ninnovations and further institutional development and reform for effective regional \nenvironmental management.  \n \n14.  Output  I.  The  strategic  roadmap  will  (a)  define  the  overall  roles,  authority,  and \nresponsibilities of the RSCs, as well as intergovernmental mandates, especially regarding the \nSEPA,  RSCs,  and  provincial  and  local  EPBs  relationship;  (b)  provide  guidance  on  policy \norientation for regional environmental management, and (c) develop overall short-, medium-, \nand  long-term  goals  and  targets  for  regional  environmental  management  and  the  RSCs\u2019 \ndevelopment.  The  development  of  the  strategic  roadmap  will  be  based  on  the  vision  and \nrationale  for  the  RSCs\u2019  establishment  and  an  overall  analysis  of  key  environmental \nmanagement issues regionally and priority areas for improvement. The strategic roadmap will \nbe drawn in accordance with existing environmental legislation and in line with the 11th 5-year \nplan.  \n \n15.  Output  II.  The  institutional  development  plan  will  cover  (a)  specific  environmental \nmanagement functions of the RSCs in the areas of supervising, enforcing, and coordinating \nenvironmental management, as well as in responding to environmental accidents and incidents; \n(b) a staffing and recruitment plan, including job descriptions and a recruitment schedule; (c) a \ncapacity-building  program  with  a  training  plan;  (d)  an  information-flow  and  reporting \narrangement; (e) cost estimates and budgets for establishing and operating RSCs; and (f) a \nphased development schedule from initial establishment through full operation. The institutional \ndevelopment plan will be drawn up based on a comprehensive study of the key institutional, \nfinancial,  administration,  and  coordination  challenges  and  opportunities  created  by  the \nestablishment of the RSCs.  \n \n ", "4   \n16.  Output III. Staff from SEPA, the RSCs, and local EPBs will better understand regional \nenvironmental management issues and gain knowledge and skills through (i) on-the-job training \nand (ii) pilot testing of new organizational models at one or two selected RSCs. The training will \nbe designed in accordance with an assessment of the most pressing needs. Two national \ntraining workshops and on-the-job training at the RSCs will be carried out. The pilot studies at \nselected RSCs will focus on the issue of emergency responses to environmental accidents and \nincidents. \n \n17.  Output IV. A policy proposal will be prepared and submitted to the State Council based \non TA findings. This proposal will recommend policy and institutional changes for effective \nregional environmental management. \n \n18.  TA  implementation  will  also  emphasize  the  transfer  of  international  experience  and \nknowledge to government staff. A report on the international experience and its implications for \nthe development of SEPA\u2019s RSCs will be prepared. A study tour to a developed country or other \ndeveloping countries with good practices will be organized. The study tour participants will be \nsenior staff of SEPA (the Executing Agency), the newly established RSCs, and other related \ngovernment agencies as needed.  \n \n19.  As milestones, three consultation workshops will be held to discuss RSC design, solicit \ncomments  on  the  strategic  roadmap  and  the  institutional  development  plan,  and  reach \nconsensus among key stakeholders. Representatives from related ministries and provincial and \nlocal  EPBs  will  be  invited.  The  first  workshop  will  discuss  the  guiding  principles  and \nmethodologies for developing the strategic roadmap and institutional development plan. The \nsecond workshop will discuss the draft strategic roadmap and institutional development plan. \nThe third workshop will assess the outcomes of TA implementation and discuss the draft policy \nproposal to the State Council and follow-up steps for further developing RSCs.  \n \n20.  USEPA has expressed strong interest in cooperating with ADB in TA implementation. \nUSEPA will be able to make a valuable contribution through staff inputs and by providing \ntraining based on its 35 years of experience and knowledge accumulation gained during the \nestablishment and development of USEPA regional offices. Given that this TA cannot cover all \naspects needed for the development of RSCs, the possibility exists that the World Bank will \nprovide support to further develop RSCs in a later stage, as SEPA has requested.2 If this comes \nto pass, SEPA, ADB, USEPA, and the World Bank will coordinate with each other in a timely \nfashion and work closely to avoid any potential duplication of effort and to maximize the benefits \nderived from financial and human resources.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $710,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $550,000 \nequivalent. TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government \nwill finance the remaining $160,000 equivalent. Cost estimates and financing plan are presented \nin Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  During its visit to the World Bank in November 2005, a senior delegation of SEPA asked the World Bank to support \nto the development of RSCs, and the World Bank has expressed interest.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  SEPA will be the Executing Agency for TA. A steering committee chaired by the Minister \nor a vice minister of SEPA will be established, comprising a senior official from each of SEPA\u2019s \ndepartments  and  offices:  Department  of  Human  Resources  Management  and  Institutional \nAffairs  (DHRMIA),  Department  of  Supervision,  International  Cooperation  Department,  and \nForeign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO). The steering committee will meet at the three TA \nworkshops and provide overall guidance to TA.  \n \n23.  A TA management office to carry out day-to-day operations will be established in SEPA. \nA deputy director general of DHRMIA will serve as the head of the TA management office and \nfunction as overall TA coordinator. FECO and DHRMIA will work closely together and be jointly \nresponsible for operational matters and day-to-day communications among ADB, consultants, \nand concerned government agencies.  \n \n24.  A  team  of  international  and  domestic  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  and \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  TA \nimplementation  will  require  5.5  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  30 \nperson-months of domestic. The international consultants will be experts in (i) environmental \npolicy  and  institutional  development  (4.0  persons-months)  and  (ii)  environmental  capacity \nbuilding  and  training  (1.5  person-months).  The  two  consultants  should  have  extensive \nexperience in the PRC and knowledge about developing regional environmental management \noffices. The required expertise for domestic consultants includes (i) environmental management \nand  institutions  (9  person-months),  (ii)  public  administration  (5  person-months),  (iii) \nenvironmental capacity building and training (5 person-months), (iv) environmental law and \nenforcement (6 person-months), and (v) environmental information management (5 person-\nmonths). One of the domestic consultants will serve as team leader, and one of the international \nconsultants will serve as the deputy team leader. Outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices are provided in Appendix 3. The equipment to be provided under TA will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n25.  To  effectively  manage  the  consultant  team,  a  staff  member  of  DHRMIA  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day technical communication with the team leader and other consultants, \nand a staff member of FECO will be responsible for the overall management of consultants.  \n \n26.  The  Environment  and  Social  Safeguard  Division  (RSES)  of  ADB\u2019s  RSDD  will  be \nresponsible for TA administration in close collaboration with the Agriculture, Environment, and \nNatural Resources Division of ADB\u2019s East and Central Asia Department. Implementation of TA \nwill take 14 months, from January 2006 to February 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Institutional Development of SEPA\u2019s \nRegional Supervision Centers, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions \nMechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nImproved  Goal and targets specified in the strategic  SEPA\u2019s Annual  Assumption/Risk  \nenvironmental  roadmap are reached, and tasks specified in the  Environmental Statistic  \u2022  Governments at \nmanagement  institutional development plan for the 11th 5-year  Report 2006-2010 a  various levels \ncapacity regionally  plan period are fulfilled.    are committed to \nin the PRC     SEPA\u2019s annual reports  improved \n    on overall PRC  regional \n  environmental  environmental \nmanagement   management. \n \nRSCs\u2019 annual reports to \nSEPA \n \nADB\u2019s project review \nmissions \n \nDialogue with the \nGovernment \nOutcome       \nSEPA\u2019s RSCs  All five RSCs are established by July 2006, with  SEPA\u2019s annual working  Assumption  \nestablished and  30% of positions filled, and start operating in  reports  \u2022  Strong \nfunctioning in line  2006 in accordance with the strategic roadmap    commitment \nwith the strategic  and the institutional development plan.
