INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  facing  the  challenges  of  energy  security  and  climate  change,  some  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) have taken the lead in promoting renewable energy. At the same \ntime, expectations are raised for smart grid technology out of concern that unstable output of \nrenewable energy will adversely affect the power systems which the power from renewable \nenergy will be fed into. In this context, during the second meeting of the Asia Solar Energy \nForum  in  Tokyo,  Japan,  in  December  2010,  several  South  Asia  DMCs  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \ndeveloping the smart grid. The concept paper was approved on 20 May 20111 and further \ndiscussed  during  the  Workshop  for  Solar  Energy  and  Smart  Grid2  in  Jodhpur,  India,  in \nSeptember 2011. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Promoting the availability and use of clean energy is one of ADB's highest priorities. In \n2010,  ADB  funded  nearly  $1.76  billion  worth  of  projects  with  clean  energy  components, \nexceeding its $1 billion target for the third year in a row. From 2013, ADB will raise the target for \nclean energy to $2 billion a year. The Asia and Pacific region, where demand for energy is \nprojected to almost double by 2030, could substantially increase the use of clean power from \nsustainable solar energy and other renewable sources within the next 3 years. For example, the \nGovernment of India launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in 2010 to (i) create \nan enabling policy framework for deployment of 20,000 megawatts (MW) of solar power by \n2022; and (ii) ramp up the capacity of grid-connected solar power generation to 1,000 MW \nwithin  3  years,  with  an  additional  3,000  MW  by  2017  through  the  mandatory  use  of  the \nrenewable purchase obligation by utilities backed with a preferential tariff. \n3.  Several South Asian DMCs requested TA for applying smart grid technology to their \npower  systems.  The  smart  grid  is  expected  to  increase  the  connectivity,  automation,  and \ncoordination among suppliers, consumers, and networks that perform either wide-area bulk \ntransmission or local distribution tasks. With the development of a smart grid, the concept of a \ncentralized network shifts toward decentralization of the electricity system, as businesses and \nhomes begin generating more wind and solar electricity, enabling them to sell surplus energy \nback to their utilities. The modernization of networks is necessary for energy efficiency, real-time \nmanagement of power flows, and to provide the two-way metering needed to compensate local \nproducers of power. Although transmission networks are already controlled on a real-time basis, \nmost  are  unable  to  handle  challenges  such  as  those  posed  by  the  intermittent  nature  of \nalternative electricity generation because of its susceptibleness to the weather.  \n4.  The consensus among DMCs is that to mainstream power generation from renewable \nenergy, the smart grid needs to (i) maintain system stability in the grid; (ii) promote rooftop solar \nphotovoltaics; and (iii) reduce technical and commercial losses in distribution grids, and thereby \nboost energy efficiency. In India, for example, ADB's country operations business plan, 2011-\n20133 stated that energy operations will focus on the generation and transmission of clean and \nrenewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 May 2011. \n2 A large number of government officials from South Asian DMCs and private sector representatives from developed     \ncountries participated in the workshop.  \n3 ADB. 2010. India: Country Operations Business Plan 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  In  some  DMCs  where  large-scale  renewable  energy  projects  involving  wind  power, \nphotovoltaics, and concentrated solar power are being developed, there is growing concern \nover  the  adverse  effects  that  renewable  energy's  fluctuating  output  can  have  on  system \nfrequency and voltage of existing grids. Smart grid technology is expected to mitigate such \nadverse effects on transmission. System voltage fluctuation, in particular, would be a serious \nproblem for local transmission companies4 in charge of high-voltage transmission systems \ndirectly connected to renewable energy sources. For low-voltage distribution grids, smart grid \ntechnology attracts attention as a promising means to reduce technical and commercial loss by \nusing more advanced technologies such as high-voltage distribution systems (HVDS). The \nsmart meter, a major component of smart grid technology, would enable two-way power flow \nmetering  and  more  easily  accommodate  dispersed  power  systems  such  as  rooftop \nphotovoltaics in the distribution grid. Smart meters are also expected to be effective tools for \ndata  gathering  and  for  distribution  analysis.  The  International  Smart  Grid  Action  Network \n(ISGAN)5 proposed that ADB conduct joint pilot studies on smart grid components for grid-\nconnected transmission and distribution systems in selected DMCs. \n6.  Considering off-grid power systems for remote villages and islands in DMCs, fluctuation \nof system frequency and voltage would be a major obstacle to promoting renewable energy.  \nBoth in small-scale remote grids and large-scale interconnected grids, promoting renewable \nenergy such as solar and wind will be key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Photovoltaics, \nin  particular,  would  be  optimal  for  remote  grids  because  the  equipment  is  static  and \ncomparatively easy to manage for local people. On the other hand, in small-scale remote grids \nphotovoltaic  output  fluctuation  would  be  rather  large  and  could  substantially  affect  system \nfrequency and voltage. Smart grid technology could help achieve system stability in such cases. \nThe Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership6 (GSEP) is currently conducting a feasibility \nstudy  on  mini-grid  system  with  solar  photovoltaics  and  asked  ADB  for  collaboration  in \ndeveloping an innovative public\u2013private partnership (PPP) mini-grid project for environment-\nfriendly rural electrification with large-scale solar photovoltaics. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 Fluctuation of system frequency is determined by a real-time imbalance between total system output and demand. \nTherefore, system frequency fluctuation caused by renewable energy would not be so serious for now because the \ntotal installed capacity of renewable energy would still be much lower than the total interconnected system capacity. \nOn the other hand, to maintain the system voltage, system operators should provide adequate reactive power within \neach local area in the grid. However, output fluctuation of large-scale renewable energy causes an imbalance of \nreactive power locally, and some countermeasures would be necessary to maintain adequate system voltage. \n5 ISGAN was established by several governments, including those of the People's Republic of China, Germany, India, \nJapan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Spain,  and  the  United  States.  ISGAN  creates  a  mechanism  for  multilateral \ncollaboration to advance the development and deployment of smarter electric grids around the world. By creating a \nnetwork of national-level stakeholders, ISGAN facilitates a dynamic  exchange of knowledge, best practices, \ntechnical assistance, and project coordination. It aims to improve the understanding of smart grid technologies, \npractices, and systems to accelerate their development and deployment, and to promote adoption of related \nenabling government policies (http://www.cleanenergyministerial.org/ISGAN/).   \n6 Created in the wake of the 1992 Rio Summit, the Global Sustainable Electricity Partnership, formerly known as e8, \nis a nonprofit organization composed of 10 world-leading electricity companies whose mission is to play an active \nrole in global electricity issues within the international framework and to promote sustainable energy development \nthrough electricity sector projects and human capacity building activities in developing and emerging nations \nworldwide (http://www.globalelectricity.org/en/index.jsp). \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be smart grid for renewable energy developed and implemented in South \nAsian DMCs. The outcome will be improved greater institutional capacity of South Asian DMCs \nfor smart grid development. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The regional capacity development TA aims to promote smart grid development to \nmainstream renewable energy and boost energy efficiency in South Asian DMCs. The TA will \nhelp (i) promote an understanding by all stakeholders of the smart grid's potential as a catalyst \nfor  mainstreaming  renewable  energy  and  boosting  energy  efficiency  in  the  subregion, \n(ii) determine  the  key  actions  required  to  accelerate  its  development,  (iii)  formulate  the \ninstitutional and business models for development and deployment of smart grid technology, \nand (iv) establish the mechanisms to promote technology transfer to developing countries and \nto deepen research and development in South Asian DMCs.  \n9.  This initiative will cover (i) high- and middle-voltage transmission grid management to \nabsorb  large  amounts  of  intermittently  generated  power  from  renewable  energy  sources; \n(ii) distribution-level  grid  management  to  mainstream  distributed,  grid-connected  renewable \nenergy projects and reduce technical and commercial losses in the network; and (iii) mini-grid \ndevelopment in remote and rural areas with renewable energy systems. \n10.  To implement such projects, a well-organized and systematic knowledge management \nprogram will be critical and it will need to involve (i) DMC governments, (ii) private sector and \nresearch and development agencies, and (ii) developed countries and development partners. \nThe key activities of the proposed TA are outlined in paras. 11\u201315. \n11.  Feasibility studies of the pilot projects for smart grid development will be conducted with \nother  partners.  ISGAN  asked  ADB  to  jointly  develop  a  pilot  program  for  stabilizing  the \ntransmission  grid  to  mainstream  renewable  energy  and  boost  energy  efficiency.  GSEP \nproposed that ADB collaborate in developing a PPP mini-grid project for rural electrification in \nMaldives. In collaboration with ISGAN and the private sector (GSEP), the TA will conduct \nvarious feasibility studies on applicable smart grid components at three different levels\u2014high-\nvoltage transmission, low-voltage distribution, and mini-grid development in rural areas.  \n12.  For high-voltage transmission, it is envisaged to conduct feasibility studies on applicable \nsmart  grid  components  such  as  energy  storage  systems  (ESS)  and/or  renewable  energy \noperation centers. As mentioned in para. 5, stabilizing the system voltage would be important \nfor  local  transmission  companies  that  will  be  in  charge  of  transmission  systems  directly \nconnected to renewable energy sources. In order to maintain adequate system voltage, it would \nbe effective to utilize batteries as ESS and/or adjust the reactive power output of the existing \ngrid-connected power plants such as thermal and hydro. For adequate coordination of large-\nscale renewable energy generation, ESS and/or existing power plants, the renewable energy \noperation center would be the key component. With such a control center, system operators can \ngather data from renewable energy facilities on a real-time basis and control renewable energy \ngeneration, ESS and/or existing power plants in an integrated manner.   \n ", "4   \n13.  For low-voltage distribution, it is envisaged to conduct feasibility studies on applicable \nsmart grid components such as HVDS and smart meters. As mentioned in para. 5, reducing \ndistribution loss and encouraging widespread dissemination of rooftop photovoltaics would be \nmajor issues for distribution companies in DMCs. Upgrading existing distribution systems to \nHVDS  would  be  an  effective  measure  to  reduce  technical  loss.  Smart  meters  would  help \naccumulate data such as voltage and current in distribution grids. These data can be utilized for \nanalysis of commercial loss and voltage fluctuation caused by reverse power flow from rooftop \nphotovoltaic installations into distribution grids. Smart meters are also expected to conduct two-\nway metering for surplus power from rooftop photovoltaics to utilities\u2019 distribution grids. \n14.  As for mini-grid development in rural areas, it is envisaged to conduct feasibility studies \non a combination of photovoltaic and conventional thermal plants. As mentioned in para. 6, to \nmaintain system stability in a mini-grid with large-scale photovoltaic power generation, it is \nabsolutely indispensable to compensate for the intermittence of photovoltaic output. In many \ncases, conventional thermal power plants such as diesel generators and/or gas turbines are the \nmain power sources in existing mini-grids. Therefore, integrated control of photovoltaics and \nexisting diesel generators and/or gas turbines would be the effective means of compensating for \nthe intermittence of photovoltaic output.  \n15.  Knowledge management programs will be conducted to share the best practice of pilot \nprojects  and  promote  technology  transfers  from  developed  countries  to  DMCs.  Through \nextensive consultation, the TA will support development of a PPP coordination mechanism \namong  the  public  sector  agencies,  the  international  and  domestic  private  sector,  and \ninternational development partners. Some international workshops will be held to (i) promote \nprivate  sector  participation,  (ii)  call  for  support  from  other  development  partners,  and  (iii) \ndisseminate best practices to other regional DMCs. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction in the \namount of $1,400,000 equivalent, and administered by ADB. The expected contributions from \nthe private sector (GSEP) would be equipment, technical study, and organizing workshops on \npilot projects for mini-grid systems. The expected contribution from ISGAN would be counterpart \nstaff.  The  expected  contributions  from  the  governments  of  participating  DMCs  would  be \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation and transport.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be carried out by a team of \nconsultants. The implementing agencies are to be determined according to the pilot projects of \nthe TA7. The Energy Division of the South Asia Department will supervise the work of the \nconsultants in close coordination with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nand other operational ADB departments in order to share the output of similar TAs on smart grid \nin other regions covered by ADB. \n18.  ADB will hire a consulting firm to conduct a feasibility study on smart grid development \nfor transmission, distribution, and mini-grid systems. The consulting work will comprise about \n15 person-months of international consulting and 22 person-months of national consulting to \n                                                 \n7 For example, public-owned local transmission companies can be implementing agencies for the pilot projects for \nhigh-voltage transmission, public-owned local distribution companies for low-voltage distribution and governments \nfor mini-grid development. \n ", "  5\nprovide  (i)  technical  support  for  identification  of  the  necessary  smart  grid  components  for \ntransmission (e.g., a renewable energy operation center), for distribution (e.g., HVDS and smart \nmeter), and for the mini-grid (e.g., an integrated control system for a combination of photovoltaic \nand  conventional  thermal  power;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  implementing  agencies  to \nformulate  technical  specifications  for  smart  grid  components;  and  (iii) monitoring  of  and \nreporting on TA activities and output. The national consultants will work with the international \nconsultants to provide information on local power systems. \n19.  ADB will also hire an individual international consultant as a PPP specialist for 5 person-\nmonths and two national consultants as PPP coordinators for 4 person-months each, who will \n(i) coordinate domestic and foreign private sector and government agencies to assist smart grid \ndevelopment; (ii) coordinate the TA with the partners, e.g., ISGAN and GSEP; and (ii) execute \nknowledge management programs such as organizing international workshops and supporting \npublication of the reports of the feasibility study on the pilot projects of the TA. \n20.  Two  individual  international  consultants  will  be  hired  for  3  person-months  each  to \nconduct  financial  analyses  and  environmental  and  social  safeguard  assessments  for  pilot \nprojects.  \n21.  The selection of consultants will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and disbursement under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The consulting firm will be chosen using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method at the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. All equipment procured \nunder the TA will be turned over to the implementing agencies after TA completion. Advance \ncontracting will be used to expedite the mobilization of the consultants. \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from January 2012 to December 2014. The \noutline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Implementation progress will be \nreported as outlined in Appendix 3.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.
