THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The project is aligned with India\u2019s priority agenda to improve water use efficiency and \nwater productivity in the irrigation sector to double farmers income and reduce the country water \nstresses. It also contributes to the implementation of Bihar agriculture road map 2017\u20132022. The \nproject will support the modernization of the Ara canal system, 202,000 hectares (ha) cultivable \ncommand area, which comprises about 700 kilometers of unlined canals built in the 1870s. The \nmodernization strategy of the Ara canal system follows the framework for modernization of major- \nand medium-sized irrigation that was elaborated for the Government of India under the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s financed Scoping Study for a National Water Use Efficiency Improvement \nSupport Program.1   \n2.  The Ara canal system performance was assessed through the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization rapid appraisal process. The results generally reflected a low level of water delivery \nservices and a below-average overall performance. Due to deferred maintenance, the system is \nin poor physical condition. Damaged canals and control structures as well as outdated designs, \nequipment and procedures resulted in significant conveyance and distribution water losses. Weak \nmanagement and operation by the Bihar Water Resources Department (BWRD) further hampers \nthe overall performance of the system. There are large inequities in water distribution. Farmers \nlocated at the head of the canals waste plentiful amount of water. This reduces canal water \navailability for farmers located at the middle and tail of the canals. Therefore, most irrigation at \nthe tail of the canal relies exclusively on costly groundwater pumping. The system average water \nuse efficiency was estimated at 35% with irrigation water not reaching 50% of the command area. \n3.  The project will provide solutions to two key constraints of Ara main canal system \nperformance: (i) inadequate irrigation infrastructure; and (ii) inadequate system management, and \noperation and maintenance (MOM). The project will also provide agriculture and marketing \nsupport services to help farmers maximize project benefits. The proposed project outcome will \nbe: higher irrigation efficiency, agricultural water productivity and climate resilience in the Ara \ncanal system. The proposed project outputs are: (i) Ara canal system irrigation infrastructure \nmodernized; (ii) more efficient and sustainable management, operation and maintenance for the \nAra  canal  system  established;  and  (iii)  farmers\u2019  capacity  for  on-farm  water  productivity \nimprovement enhanced. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) India farmers\u2019 \nincome doubled by 2022;2 (ii) Bihar State objective to have at least one food item in every Indian \nplate by 2022 achieved;3 and (iii) resilience of farmers in the project area to ongoing and uncertain \nfuture climate change increased.4  \n4.  Total investment cost is tentatively estimated at $503 million including $352 million to be \nfinanced from ADB\u2019s regular ordinary capital resources and $151 million to be financed by the \nGovernment of Bihar. The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) and ensuing project are \nproposed for approval in 2018 and 2020, respectively, as listed in the country operations business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for India.5   \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

In December 2016, the Government of Bihar approached ADB for funding support. ADB \nnoted  that  the  modernization  envisaged  by  BWRD  was  limited,  with  focus  on  improving \nconveyance  efficiency  through  canal  lining.  In  October  2017,  BWRD  recruited  Tractebel \nEngineering Private Limited under a lump sum contract to prepare a modernization plan for the \nAra canal system that would follow the framework for modernization of major- and medium-sized \nirrigation that was elaborated under the ADB-financed Scoping Study for a National Water Use \nEfficiency Improvement Support Program. The Tractebel Engineering Private Limited proposed \nproject  concept  was  reviewed  by  ADB  reconnaissance  mission  and  several  technical  and \ninstitutional improvements identified and agreed with BWRD. The project concept was therefore \nexpanded to include a balance of engineering works including conjunctive use and pressure pipes \nfor smaller flows, measures for improved MOM, and agriculture support. \n6.  The proposed TRTA is required to develop the project concept to feasibility study level \nand meet project readiness criteria for loan approval.6 The TRTA will (i) develop feasibility design \nof the proposed project; (ii) review the technical and economic viability of the proposed project; \n(iii)  evaluate  safeguards  requirements  and  prepare  associated  approval  documents  and \nimplementation plans; (iv) prepare advance detailed design for 30% of the works, expected to be \nthe main and branch canals prism re-sectioning and lining, as well as bidding documents for these \nworks;  (v)  prepare  design\u2013build\u2013operate  (DBO)  contracts  for  the  management  supervisory \ncontrol  and  data  acquisition  system  and  also  for  the  pressure-pipe  systems;  (vi) prepare \nconsulting package(s) for detailed design, construction supervision and project implementation \nsupport; (vii) assist in preparation of loan documentation; and (viii) support implementation start-\nup. \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. The TRTA team is expected \nto be mobilized in July 2018. \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.

Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $1,545,000 of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nfinance and administer $545,000 separate from ADB\u2019s fund flow. The government was informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TRTA and will be responsible for selection, supervision and \nevaluation of consultants, and procurement of surveys financed by ADB under the TRTA.  \n10.
