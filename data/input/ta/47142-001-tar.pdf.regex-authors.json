The  Government  of the  Philippines,  through the  Department  of  Social Welfare  and \nDevelopment  (DSWD),  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  cofinance  the \ngovernment\u2019s KALAHI\u2013CIDSS National Community-Driven Development Project (KC-NCDDP), \nincluding capacity development technical assistance (TA) to support its implementation. The \nKC-NCDDP is the government\u2019s flagship program, which aims to improve access to basic \nservices, reduce poverty, and support the recovery and rehabilitation efforts in communities \naffected by Typhoon Yolanda (international name: Haiyan). The TA is included in the 2014\u2013\n2016 country operations business plan for the Philippines.1 During the fact-finding mission on 9\u2013\n11  October  2013, the government  and  ADB  agreed  on the TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The KC-NCDDP increases the coverage of the Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan (Linking \nArms Against Poverty)\u2013Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (KALAHI\u2013\nCIDSS) project being managed by DSWD to include poor communities, particularly those in \nprovinces severely affected by Typhoon Yolanda.3 While the KC-NCDDP will train program staff \nand stakeholders under its capacity building and institutional support component,4 the TA will \ncomplement and strengthen capacity building and institutional support by providing a needs-\nbased learning and development (L&D) framework, sharply focused interventions, and cost-\neffective  pedagogical  methods  to  develop  the  required  professional  and  technical \ncompetencies. These components will be implemented with ADB project support that will assist \npoor communities improve their resiliency to natural hazards.5  \n3.  Building  on  the  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  management structure  and  systems, DSWD  is the \nexecuting agency for the KC-NCDDP. While DSWD is widely recognized as a highly competent \nand well-governed agency, the sizeable geographical and financial scaling-up of community-\ndriven development operations, and the extent of reconstruction activities in affected areas \nalongside the expansion of its other programs will put a strain on its management and oversight \ncapacities. Fiduciary risks are likely to increase with the scaling-up due to higher number of \nprocurement packages and financial transactions, which will increase by two to three times. The \ngreater  involvement  of  more  national  government  agencies,  local  government  units,  and \ndevelopment agencies poses potential coordination challenges. To address these concerns, \nDSWD will (i) strengthen national and subnational management and governance systems; (ii) \nprovide adequate staff (an additional 5,215 regional and municipal staff will be hired, of which \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2014\u20132016. Manila.  In the plan, the TA is titled \nEnhancing Capacities for the National Community-Driven Development Program (formerly Strengthening Capacity \nfor Scaled-Up Implementation of Community-Driven Development). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2013. \n3  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS was launched in 2002, with cofinancing from the World Bank. In 2004, the Spanish Agency for \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  provided  financing  to  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  under the  Empowerment  and \nDevelopment of Communities project. In 2010, the World Bank provided additional financing to KALAHI\u2013CIDSS \nuntil  May  2014.  The  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation provided  parallel  financing. As  of  December  2012, \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS covered 8,435 barangays (villages) in 364 poor municipalities and supported 8,776 subprojects, \n  reaching 1.95 million households. \n4 Program staff include project management staff based at the national and regional DSWD offices and community \nfacilitators and area coordinators in the field. Program stakeholders include community volunteers, counterpart \nstaff of local government units, and staff of other government agencies.  \n5  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the KALAHI\u2013CIDSS National Community-Driven Development Project. Manila. \n ", "2   \nabout 80% are community facilitators providing frontline services); (iii) decentralize functions to \nregional  offices;  (iv) strengthen the grievance redress  system;  (v)  simplify  procedures  and \nreporting requirements, including the community empowerment activity cycle to better respond \nto the diverse and unique circumstances of beneficiaries;6 (vi) establish robust monitoring and \naudit systems, including third party monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and oversight by civil \nsociety organizations; and (vii) provide capacity development programs for KC-NCDDP staff, \nlocal government unit counterparts, and other program stakeholders.  \n4.  Drawing from the experiences of KALAHI\u2013CIDSS, the following training programs are \ninitially  identified  to  be delivered  under  the  KC-NCDDP:  (i)  community-driven  development \nconcepts and approaches; (ii) development planning and management; (iii) conflict resolution \nand  mediation;  (iv)  community  facilitation;  (v)  financial  management;  (vi)  procurement;           \n(vii)  project  management;  (viii)  M&E,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  including \napproaches to respond to special circumstances of communities (e.g., indigenous peoples, \nareas  affected  by  conflict  and/or  climate  change,  or  disaster  prone);  (ix)  gender;  and                \n(x) grievance redress. While many of these programs  were designed and delivered under \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS, no systematic review of the course content, delivery methods, and learning \noutcomes has been undertaken.  \n \n5.  A review of training interventions is therefore very timely and important in view of the \ncomplexity and magnitude of the KC-NCDDP operations, the aftermath of the disaster, the \ndiverse competency and training requirements at different levels of program administration, and \nthe huge number of staff and stakeholders that need to be trained, particularly during inception \nof the KC-NCDDP implementation. Thus, the project\u2019s capacity-building interventions need to be \nbetter attuned to the distinct learning profiles and needs of program staff and stakeholders. For \nexample, community facilitators and area coordinators will require specialized and continuing \ntraining support as they are at the front line of program implementation. Similarly, effective and \nefficient delivery of capacity-building programs for finance and procurement specialists is crucial \nin mitigating fiduciary and governance risks. The results of the review will inform the L&D \nframework that will guide the planning, management, and monitoring of capacity development \nactivities to support the KC-NCDDP implementation. \n \n6.  Training  interventions  will  need  to  be  better  aligned  with  the  required  institutional \nadjustments  and  program  design  enhancements,  such  as  rationalizing  the  community \nempowerment  activity  cycle  process;  enhancing  gender  sensitivity  of  program  activities; \nadapting subprojects in communities affected by climate change, disasters, and conflict; and \nreflecting  local  culture  and  circumstances.  The  KC-NCDDP  also  needs  to  address  the \nchallenges encountered during KALAHI\u2013CIDSS implementation in the provision of adequate \ntraining materials and easy access to learning resources while at work or during deployment to \nthe field. Although knowledge exchange and regular interaction among program staff have been \nhelpful in enhancing work performance, such opportunities have been constrained by the lack of \nfinancial resources; the scale-up will further strain DSWD capacity to fully support them. Thus, \nDSWD is looking at options for establishing a knowledge portal and using information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) for human resources development. ICT can also be utilized in \nestablishing a skills and training registry system for program staff.  \n \n                                                \n6  The community empowerment activity cycle comprises the following phases: (i) social preparation; (ii) project \nidentification, selection, and planning; (iii) project approval; (iv) subproject implementation, monitoring, evaluation, \nand operation and maintenance; and (v) transition. \n ", "  3 \n7.  KC-NCDDP  coverage  is  expected  to  expand  in  the  coming  years  to  include  the \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), through a parallel program financed entirely \nby the government. The inclusion of the ARMM will result in an additional 104 municipalities \ncovering about 600,000 households. DSWD has requested development partners, including \nADB, to assist in adapting the KC-NCDDP design to ARMM\u2019s unique sociopolitical context and \nidentifying  ARMM\u2019s  capacity  development  requirements  in  preparation  for  future  program \nimplementation.  \n \n8.  Given this background, the TA will support the capacity building and institutional support \ncomponent of the KC-NCDDP, particularly within the context of using the community-driven \ndevelopment approach in responding to the post-disaster needs of communities. In coordination \nwith other development partners, the TA will assist DSWD in managing the needed capacity \nbuilding interventions that (i) emphasize needs-based training programs; (ii) respond to program \nmanagement  needs;  (iii)  develop  and  sustain  institutional  capacity  for  planning  and \nmanagement of training programs; and (iv) strengthen national and subnational capacity to \npromote, monitor, assist, and evaluate decentralized training programs. In the aftermath of \nTyphoon Yolanda, the TA will help build and deepen capacities further for timely implementation \nof not only ADB supported activities, but also those of other development partners. In addition, \nthe TA will help identify ARMM\u2019s capacity development needs for future rollout of the KC-\nNCDDP. Furthermore, the TA will generate knowledge and replicable practices that will help \ninform  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  social  development  programs  with  other  developing  member \ncountries. \n \n9.  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation,  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia are closely coordinating their support for the KC-NCDPP. The TA will be informed by \nthe results of the review of the community empowerment activity cycle and other analytical work \nrelated to the KC-NCDDP, with support from the World Bank. It will build on existing capacity \nbuilding models and approaches, such as the management and leadership training assisted by \nthe Millennium Challenge Corporation and complement the World Bank-supported training of \ntrainers. The TA will be closely coordinated with DSWD\u2019s Technical Assistance Facility, which is \nsupported  by  the  Government  of  Australia.  The  facility  is  tasked  with  harmonizing  and \ncoordinating all TA support provided by DSWD\u2019s development partners.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact is improved implementation of the KC-NCDDP. The outcome is improved \ncompetencies of program staff and stakeholders to implement the KC-NCDDP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The TA outputs are (i) L&D framework established, (ii) curriculum design and learning \nmodules completed, and (iii) institutional support systems established.  \n \n12.  Learning and development framework established. The TA will help develop a well-\nconsidered  and  gender-sensitive  L&D  framework  that  provides  the  strategic  direction  for \ndeveloping the required competencies of program staff and stakeholders to support the KC-\nNCDDP implementation. The TA will conduct a learning needs assessment of program staff and \nstakeholders, including a review of past and ongoing capacity building interventions under \nKALAHI\u2013CIDSS. The assessment results will be used in defining appropriate and targeted \n ", "4   \nlearning solutions and interventions such as on-the-job training, mentoring, coaching, learning \nfrom peers, job shadowing, and e-learning.  \n \n13.  The  L&D  framework  seeks  to  develop  a  performance-oriented  learning  culture  that \nmotivates and challenges program staff and stakeholders to acquire and continuously improve \ntheir competencies. Its underlying perspectives are (i) program staff and stakeholders have \ndiverse skill and learning needs that are met through a variety of learning options, (ii) blended \nlearning  approaches  promote  effective  learning,  and (iii)  individuals  have  different  learning \nstyles. The L&D framework, which will also identify key roles in program implementation and \nlearning programs that support skills development and job performance, will be made available \nin print and electronic versions.  \n \n14.  The TA will also conduct a preliminary assessment of the institutional and organizational \nreadiness  of  the  ARMM  for  future  implementation  of  the  KC-NCDDP.  It  will  recommend \nstrategies and options for addressing identified capacity gaps. \n \n15.  Curriculum  design  and  learning  modules  completed.  Based  on  the  needs \nassessment and L&D framework of output 1, the TA will develop a curriculum-based approach \nto learning for program staff and stakeholders. The curriculum will provide learners with a \nlearning track or stream of programs for building and enhancing competencies. It will comprise a \nseries of building blocks for staff and stakeholders to develop their skills and capabilities. Core \nprograms and specialized courses will be provided.  \n \n16.  Core  programs  will  equip  staff  and  stakeholders  with  basic  knowledge,  tools,  and \ntechniques to help them carry out their functions efficiently and effectively. Such programs will \naddress  knowledge  and  skills  gaps  to  achieve  the  desired  results.  Specialized  courses, \ncomprising  intermediate  and  advanced  programs,  will  update  and  sharpen  expertise. \nParticipation in these courses may require completion of introductory or prerequisite courses. \nAmong  the  required  competency  areas  initially  identified  by  DSWD  are  development \nmanagement,  local  governance,  working  in  multidisciplinary  settings,  data  analysis  and \nmanagement,  conflict  management,  community  procurement  and  finance,  knowledge \nmanagement, and local disaster response and disaster risk reduction.  \n \n17.  The TA will support the development and pilot-testing of learning modules and making \nlearning resources available in print and electronic versions. M&E will be built into the programs \nto track and assess learning outcomes. The TA will introduce a credit system for key programs \nto reflect the achievement of knowledge and skills of staff and stakeholders. The TA will also \nexplore options with selected higher educational institutions in awarding academic credits for \nsuccessful completion of core and specialized programs toward earning postgraduate certificate \nand degree programs. \n \n18.  Institutional  support  systems  established.  The  TA  will  identify  the  appropriate \ninstitutional and organizational arrangements for developing and managing ICT-enabled L&D \nprograms, including an M&E system for tracking learning progress and outcomes. It will support \nthe establishment of a web-based learning resource center and a skills and learning registry \nsystem. It will help establish ICT-enabled learning support mechanisms for participating in the \ncore and specialized programs, as well as other learning opportunities such as community or \nlearners  or  peer-to-peer  learning,  mentoring,  and  coaching.  The  TA  will  help  establish \npartnerships with selected higher educational institutions and training institutes.  \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,145,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in terms of remuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nutilities, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution is estimated to \naccount for about 30% of the total TA cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  DSWD  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  implement  the  TA  under  the  direct \nsupervision and guidance of the DSWD secretary. Chaired by the DSWD secretary, the National \nProgram Management Team will oversee TA implementation, provide quality assurance, and \nextend policy direction and support. It will ensure that the TA complements initiatives and \nrelated activities coordinated by the Technical Assistance Facility. The implementing agencies \nwill include the national and regional program management offices, and participating provincial, \nmunicipal, and barangay local government units.  \n \n21.  ADB will engage consultants through individual consultant selection in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms \nof reference for international (8 person-months) and national (38 person-months) consulting \ninputs are in Appendix 3. To provide the TA with flexibility to mobilize expertise as the KC-\nNCDDP evolves, the terms of reference and selection criteria for 15 person-months of national \nconsulting  services\u2014in  areas  including  financial  management,  L&D  modules,  and  systems \ndesign and programming\u2014will be determined during project implementation. The consultants \nwill administer the activity costs related to workshops, training, seminars, conferences, and \nstudies. All procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time). All procured assets will be transferred to DSWD after TA \ncompletion.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented from January 2014 to December 2015. DSWD will monitor \nand periodically report on the TA activities, progress, and accomplishments. ADB will conduct \nregular supervision missions and closely coordinate with DSWD. Knowledge, lessons, expected \noutputs, and outcome evaluation will be disseminated through workshops and publications, as \nwell as the government websites and print and social media.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  for  Enhancing  Capacities  for  the  KALAHI\u2013CIDSS  National  Community-Driven \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  CDD subprojects completed by  DSWD annual  Government support to \nimplementation of  2019 have at least an overall  report  the KC-NCDDP is \nthe KC-NCDDP   satisfactory rating    sustained. \n   \n75% of trained staff and  KC-NCDDP  Risk \nstakeholders demonstrate  progress reports  The political leadership \neffectiveness in applying CDD  changes. \napproaches and relevant   \npolicies and guidelines by \n2019 \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  All trained staff and  Training course  Management supports \ncompetencies of  stakeholders possess the  completion reports  capacity building \nprogram staff and  required training competencies    activities. \nstakeholders to  by 2015     \nimplement the KC-   Risk \nNCDDP  75% of trained staff and  TA progress and  The turnover rate of \n  stakeholders apply a gender- completion reports  program staff is high. \n  inclusive approach to     \ncommunity empowerment   \nactivity cycle activities by 2015    \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
