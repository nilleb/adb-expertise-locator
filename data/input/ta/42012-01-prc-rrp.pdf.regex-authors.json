THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Demonstration Project.  \n \n2.  The  project  is  a  pioneering  urban\u2013rural  infrastructure  development  initiative  of  the \nChongqing  Municipal  Government  (CMG),  which  demonstrates  its  commitment  to  reduce \neconomic and social inequalities between its urban and rural areas. The project will provide new \nand improved rural roads and potable water supply systems to eight poverty-stricken districts \nand  counties  of  the  Chongqing  municipality,  enhancing  economic,  public  health,  and \nenvironmental conditions for about 377,000 people. The project includes three components: (i) \nconstruction or rehabilitation of about 362 kilometers (km) of roads through 21 road subprojects; \n(ii) construction and improvement of nine water supply facilities which consist of new water \ntreatment plants and pipelines to boost service coverage, quality and reliability and cumulatively \nprovide about 72,500 cubic meters (m3) per day of water; and (iii) project implementation \nsupport and targeted capacity building for the project\u2019s implementing entities in district and \ncounty-level governments to ensure the effective implementation  and sustainable operation and \nmaintenance of the project facilities.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Chongqing\u2019s urban\u2013rural reform agenda is a priority of the State Council. The agenda \ncalls  for  stimulating  reforms  in  the  less-developed  western  PRC,  formulating  an  equitable \nurban\u2013rural  reform  model  for  national  replication,  and  providing  for  an  ecologically  safer \nenvironment.  This  urban\u2013rural  transformation  is  vital  to  allow  Chongqing  to  become  an \nimportant  growth  pole  in  western  PRC,  an  economic  center  of  balanced  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the first city in western PRC to \nbuild a xiaokang (a moderately prosperous society in all respects). Embracing this challenge, \nthe CMG is prioritizing the equitable and balanced development and urbanization of its two \nprimary rural areas: the Three Gorges Reservoir catchment area northeast of its urban hub, and \na poverty-stricken, ethnic minority area to the southeast. At the same time, the CMG recognizes \nthe  need  for  basic  urban\u2013rural  infrastructure,  together  with  sustainable  ecological  and \nenvironmental  protection.  Many  of  Chongqing\u2019s  rural  districts  and  counties  suffer  from \ninadequate infrastructure due partly to their remoteness, difficult terrain, and either a lack of \nwater sources or an inability to harness them. Only 75% of Chongqing\u2019s villages are accessible \nby rural roads; and many existing roads are in poor condition, restricting all-weather access. \nThe Sichuan earthquake in May 2008 underscored the vital need to improve emergency road \naccess  during  natural  calamities.  Chongqing\u2019s  rural  areas  also  suffer  from  acute  water \nshortages and poor water access. In 2008, more than 8 million rural residents had limited \naccess to safe, sustainable, potable water supplies, resulting in an increase in waterborne \ndiseases. The inadequacy of basic infrastructure, particularly water supply and roads, severely \nconstrains rural economic growth in Chongqing. It also threatens human health, compromises \nthe environment, and hampers urban\u2013rural development. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2008. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Chongqing  Urban\u2013Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Demonstration Project. Manila (TA 7108-PRC).  ", "2 \n4.  The  project  responds  directly  to  these  urban\u2013rural  and  infrastructure  challenges  by \nproviding essential road and water supply infrastructure to selected undeveloped rural areas. \nThis  will  strengthen  Chongqing\u2019s  urban\u2013rural  links,  support  balanced  and  equitable \ndevelopment, and promote environmental protection and climate proofing. It is an innovative \ndemonstration model that can be replicated nationally. The project prioritizes the poorer rural \nareas northeast and southeast of Chongqing. These areas suffer from low per capita gross \ndomestic product and poor or nonexistent infrastructure. These communities urgently need \nwater supply and rural roads, which are intricately linked. The project will demonstrate how to \naddress  water  scarcity  and  water  management  while  ensuring  that  selected  areas  are \naccessible by road.2 By providing urban\u2013rural infrastructure, the project supports the CMG\u2019s \nefforts to improve living standards in outlying areas by targeting counties with high incidences of \npoverty and large minority populations. It is consistent with the urban\u2013rural development goals \nof the 11th Five-Year Plan, which promotes equitable urbanization, balanced regional growth, \nand coordinated urban\u2013rural development. The project supports the State Council\u2019s recognition \nof  Chongqing  as  the  first  provincial  pilot  area  for  integrated  and  equitable  urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment. It is also in line with the strategic priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nIt supports ADB\u2019s Water Policy3 as well as ADB\u2019s objective of making markets work more \nefficiently by providing infrastructure and promoting environmental sustainability. By enhancing \nurban\u2013rural development, the project is consistent with Strategy 20204 and the PRC country \npartnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010 5  since  it  delivers  efficient  infrastructure,  strengthens \nenvironmental  management  and  protection,  and  enhances  inclusive  growth  and  balanced \ndevelopment.  The  project  also  improves  the  provision  of  municipal  infrastructure  service, \nsupports urban\u2013rural integration, and enhances rural town investment potential while protecting \nthe environment. In all, the project contributes substantially to the government\u2019s overarching \ngoal of promoting an equitable and balanced regional development and urbanization. \n \n5.  The project will demonstrate the following:  \n \n(i)  Stronger  water  sector  enterprises.  The  project  will  strengthen  water \nenterprises and promote the integration of urban\u2013rural water supply systems. It \nwill  upgrade  the  skills  of  operations  staff,  improves  rural  system  operational \nperformance and viability, and reduces operating losses. \n(ii)  Web-based  project  management  and  coordination  mechanism.  The \nmechanism initiated by the Chongqing project management office (PMO) will \nfacilitate  information  exchange  and  networking  of  the  executing  agency, \nimplementing agencies and units, ADB, and districts and/or counties. \n(iii)  Watershed  management  and  water  quality  monitoring.  The  project  will \nsupport  watershed  management  and  water  quality  monitoring  to  strengthen \nenvironmental awareness and protection of watershed areas. It will also support \nparallel CMG environmental protection initiatives, which include a community \nhotline initiative in Fuling District to improve local pollution control compliance. \n                                                 \n2  Urbanization Policy and Models (Appendix 2) presents the urbanization model of Chongqing and replicability in \nsimilar regions in the PRC. Adopting this would provide more balanced urban\u2013rural integration and sustainable \neconomic growth.  \n3  ADB. 2003. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila (adopted in 2001). The project \nwill assist the PRC to achieve Millennium Development Goal 7, target 7.C, which establishes the 2015 target of \nhalving the number of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. \n4  ADB. 2008.

The project will support tariff reforms by \n(a) making services affordable to the poor through tariffs that are reasonably set \naccording  to  local  conditions,  (b)  strengthening  tariff-setting  mechanisms, \n(c) increasing rural tariffs gradually to recover costs, and (d) gradual introduction \nof wastewater tariffs.  \n(v)  Urban\u2013rural road management, safety, and maintenance. The project\u2019s road \ncomponents will closely integrate with the CMG\u2019s parallel improvement initiatives \nrelating to road traffic and pedestrian safety; increased public transport services; \nand improvements in maintenance systems, tunnel management, and axle load \ninspections. \n(vi)  Climate-proofed designs. The project\u2019s road and water supply components and \nassociated  facilities,  such  as  those  for  drainage,  erosion  control,  and  slope \nprotection,  will  support  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  mitigation \nmeasures.  Better  road  connectivity  between  villages  and  towns  will  provide \nalternative all-weather routes during natural calamities.  \n(vii)  Environmental awareness and sanitation education. A pilot demonstration \nactivity grant of $50,0006 will be provided to a women\u2019s federation7 to support \nand expand a health and hygiene program for the benefit of women and children \nin four villages of Yunyang and Youyang counties, including four schools with \n2,300 students.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The project\u2019s impacts will be an improved urban\u2013rural environment and enhanced public \nhealth and quality of life for residents of affected poor districts and counties. The project's \noutcome will be better urban\u2013rural roads and water supply infrastructure in the eight districts \nand counties. Impacts and outcomes of the improved road networks will include (i) improved \nurban\u2013rural links and paved road access in rural areas; (ii) better community connectivity and \naccessibility, and inter-township and county transport integration, through enhanced all-weather \naccess to economic and social facilities and farm-to-market access; (iii) safer and more efficient \ntravel safety, and improved emergency transit during natural calamities. Impacts and outcomes \nfrom the improved water supply systems will include (i) wider water supply coverage in rural \ncommunities;  (ii)  improved  water  quantity  and  quality,  and  corresponding  improvements  in \npublic  health;  (iii)  higher  productivity  through  a  reduction  in  waterborne  illnesses;  and  (iv) \nopportunities to develop food processing and other economic activities, which were previously \nunsustainable because of the lack of potable piped water and road connectivity. Appendix 1 \npresents the design and monitoring framework. \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The project will have three outputs: (i) 21 road subcomponents consisting of about 362 \nkm of new or rehabilitated rural roads serving 31 towns in eight of Chongqing\u2019s poor districts \n(Fuling and Qianjiang) and counties (Chengkou, Fengjie, Wushan, Xiushan, Youyang, and \nYunyang); (ii) nine water supply subcomponents comprising new water treatment facilities and \npipelines cumulatively delivering 72,500 m3 per day of water to 10 towns in five poor counties \n(Youyang,  Yunyang,  Fengjie,  Wushan,  and  Chengkou);  and  (iii)  project  management  and \ninstitutional capacity building of involved agencies to promote the effective implementation and \n                                                 \n6  Financed  under ADB. 2008.

The Government of the PRC has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to finance 46.9% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term including \na grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan \nwill cover civil works, equipment, project management consulting services, and capacity building. \nThe loan will also finance taxes and duties for ADB-financed eligible expenditures. The CMG will \nonlend the loan proceeds to the implementing agencies, which are the eight districts and counties, \non the same terms and conditions as those of ADB loan. The implementing agencies will assume \nthe foreign exchange and interest rate variation risks for the ADB loan. The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, and (ii) an undertaking that this choice was its own independent decision and not made \nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n10.  As the executing agency, the CMG will have overall responsibility for the project, and \nhas established a project leading group (PLG) at the municipal level to provide policy guidance \non project implementation.11 The CMG has also established the Chongqing PMO, which will \nserve  as  the  PLG  secretariat;  provide  overall  coordination  and  management  of  project \nimplementation; and be the primary liaison portal between the ADB, the Ministry of Finance, the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  and  municipal  government  agencies.  The \nChongqing PMO will engage and supervise the technical engineering design institutes, project \nimplementation consultants, and external social and environmental monitors involved in the \nproject.  The  PLG  consists  of  senior  officials  from  Chongqing  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (DRC), Chongqing Finance Bureau, and other municipal government departments. \nThe DRC chief economist will serve as the Chongqing PMO director and will report directly to \nthe chair of the PLG. The eight involved district and county governments are the project\u2019s \nimplementing agencies, each assuming day-to-day responsibility of component implementation \nin their respective district or county. Each has established a PLG to provide policy guidance and \na PMO to serve as the PLG secretariat. Each PMO will ensure provision of counterpart funding, \nengage and supervise the environmental and social design institutes, and report on progress. \nEach PMO will have a director,12 supported by representatives from district or county agencies. \nThe  implementing  agencies  have  assigned  agencies  or state-owned  enterprises  to  be  the \nproject\u2019s  implementing  units,  which  will  establish  project  management  teams  and  assume \nresponsibility for the implementation of specific components. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.13  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation Period  June 2010 to December 2015 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2015 \nCompletion Date   \nLoan Closing Date  30 June 2016 \nProject management     \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Leading Group  The CPLG is chaired by CMG Vice-Mayor and includes \n  the CMG Deputy Secretary-General, and senior officials \nfrom Chongqing Development Reform Commission, \nChongqing Finance Bureau, Chongqing Poverty \n                                                 \n11  The PLG will be chaired by a CMG vice-mayor and will include as members the CMG deputy secretary-general, \nand senior officials from the CMG\u2019s Development and Reform Commission, Finance Bureau, Poverty Alleviation \nOffice, Transport Commission, Water Resource Bureau, Audit Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Land \nResources Bureau, Resettlement Bureau, and Construction Bureau. \n12  The PMO director is the authorized representative of local PLG.

The project includes funding for 22 person-months of international and 200 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services  to  support  the  executing  agency,  the  implementing \nagencies  and  units,  and  the  project  management  teams  in  project  implementation  and \ninstitutional capacity building.14 To facilitate project start-up, an additional 12 person-months of \nnational consulting resources will fund two individual specialists.15 The terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in the project administration manual.16 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n12.  The project will directly benefit about 377,000 people in Chongqing,17 of which about \n47,000 (12.4%) are poor. Residents in the eight poor districts and counties will benefit through \nbetter water quality and quantity, improved health, reduced waterborne diseases, a cleaner \nenvironment, improved road connectivity and reliability, and enhanced disaster management. \nThe project will create jobs and stimulate economic growth within some of Chongqing\u2019s poorest \nand most disadvantaged urban and  rural areas. In the water sector, the project will strengthen \nwater  supply  institutions,  support  water  tariff  reforms,  and  provide  the  basis  to  gradually \nintroduce  wastewater  tariffs,  while  providing  watershed  management  and  water  quality \n                                                 \n14  The consulting package will be provided through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n15  Provided through individual consultant system. \n16  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n17  The roads component will benefit 184,000 people, while the water supply component will benefit 209,000. Since \nthere are 16,000 common beneficiaries, the project will benefit a total of 377,000 people. ", "7 \nmonitoring support to strengthen environmental awareness and protection.18 The project\u2019s new \nand improved roads will provide better all-weather connectivity between villages and towns, and \nimprove emergency access during natural calamities. The project is a valuable urban\u2013rural \ninfrastructure demonstration project that can be replicated nationally. \n \nA.  Technical \n13.  The project\u2019s road and water supply components will be designed to accommodate \nseismic events. Mitigation measures will be designed into cut and fill slopes, transmission and \ndistribution  pipelines,  building  foundations  and  structures,  road  pavements,  and  other \ninfrastructure. Geologic and geotechnical analysis during detailed design will also ensure that \npipeline and road alignments follow routes of least seismic risk, an important factor as project \nroads will serve as vital escape and emergency-response corridors during natural calamities, \nsuch as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Other safety design considerations are also to be \nincorporated  into  road  components,  including  enhanced  traffic  markings  and  signage, \npedestrian lanes, bus stops, protection barriers, and improved safety education and traffic \nsafety  management.  The  project\u2019s  local  road  design  improvements  will  be  promoted  and \nreplicated by other districts and counties. The majority of the water supply systems are gravity \nfed, with low O&M costs. The project\u2019s road and water supply components with drainage, \nerosion control, and slope protection, will also support climate change adaptation. A detailed \ndescription of components is in the project administration manual.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n14.  The economic analysis19 indicates an economic internal rate of return of 15.7%\u201319.5% \nfor the roads subcomponents and 17.3%\u201319.7% for the water supply subcomponents. This is \nwell above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Economic costs include (i) capital \ncosts, such as land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental mitigation and monitoring \ncosts; (ii) project management and institutional strengthening costs; (iii) physical contingencies; \nand (iv) O&M costs. Economic benefits for rural roads include (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, \n(ii) time savings, (iii) accident avoidance costs, (iv) generated traffic benefits, and (v) income gains \ncreated by year-round road access. Water supply benefits include (i) resource cost savings (user \ncost savings and user time savings), and (ii) beneficiaries' willingness to pay for improved and \nexpanded water services. Benefits that are not readily quantifiable, such as better health, higher \nemployment, and climate adaptation, have not been included.20  \n \n15.  The financial internal rates of return and net present value have been computed for the \nwater supply subcomponents (revenue-generating) at November 2009 price levels. They range \nfrom 3.4% to 6.9%, which exceed the weighted average cost of capital at 3.3%. Water and \nwastewater tariffs account for 1.7%\u20132.0% of the average household income and 1.6%\u20132.2% of \nthe poor households\u2019 income\u2014considered acceptable given the improved service compared \nwith the current unreliable water supply situation. The districts and counties must be able to \nrationalize the need to improve fee collection in relation to improved services. The gradual \nincrease in tariffs will allow for (i) cost recovery of O&M costs, (ii) payment of debt service, and \n(iii) the establishment of a reserve fund to meet planned equipment replacement every 5 years. \nThe project will demonstrate that sustainability and cost recovery are ensured for town-level \nwater supply subcomponents that are properly planned using least-cost options, gravity-fed, and \n                                                 \n18  All districts and counties are committed to constructing wastewater treatment facilities and collection networks in \n2010\u20132014. \n19  Performed for the project\u2019s 21 road subcomponents and nine water supply subcomponents. \n20  Economic Analysis; Health Impact Analysis (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nadequately funded, managed, and operated efficiently.21 For the nonrevenue-generating road \ncomponents, the funding sources for counterpart funds, O&M costs, and debt service were \nreviewed and the counterpart funds will be provided during project implementation in a timely \nmanner. The financial management capacity of all proposed implementing agencies and units is \nadequate for the implementation of the project, and training in ADB procedures will be required \nin procurement, disbursement, project management, and accounting systems.  \n \nC.  Governance \n16.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the CMG, PMOs, implementing agencies, and their project implementing units. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration \nmanual.22  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n17.  The project will reduce poverty by ensuring that targeted poor communities have access \nto  safe  and  reliable  water  supplies  and  upgraded  and  expanded  road  networks.  This  will \nincrementally improve the living conditions of residents and migrants by providing better and \nsafer access to jobs and social services. The project\u2019s components will stimulate investment in \nthe industry and the services sectors. Up to 80% of construction jobs created by the project may \nbe  classified  as  unskilled,  and  many  are  likely  to  be  filled  by  the  unemployed.  Since \nunemployment  is  a  primary  cause  of  poverty  in  the  project  area,  the  poor  will  benefit \ndisproportionately from the jobs it creates. About CNY44.7 million in employment benefits will be \ngenerated; and women, ethnic minorities, and poor people will be prioritized for jobs during \nconstruction. The project will reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases, cutting medical \ncosts by up to CNY10 million per year during 2014\u20132033. The poverty and social assessment \nindicates that women strongly support and anticipate benefits from both the road and water \nsupply components. Gender has been mainstreamed into the project design, which includes a \nrange  of  gender-sensitive  measures  such  as  requirements  for  consultation,  training,  and \nmonitoring  indicators.  The  implementing  agencies  will  work  with  women\u2019s  federations, \ncontractors, and communities to facilitate the participation of women in paid work opportunities \nfor  physical  works,  and  to  ensure  that  all  PRC  labor  laws  and  core  labor  standards  are \nrespected. The Tujia ethnic minorities living in subcomponent areas are culturally assimilated \nwith the Han majority. The project will ensure their participation through the dissemination of \ninformation. Livelihood restoration measures associated with resettlement are incorporated in \nthe resettlement plan and project design.23 The pilot demonstration activity grant under the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will  strengthen  community-based  environmental \nawareness through a water and sanitation public education campaign on health, tariffs, and \nhygiene in Yunyang and Youyang counties. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n18.  The project is classified as environment category A. The summary environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) has been circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on the ADB \nwebsite.  The  summary  EIA  concludes  that  the  project  has  substantial  environmental  and \nsocioeconomic benefits, and that its potential environmental impacts can be mitigated through \n                                                 \n21  Financial analysis; Financial Management Assessment (Appendix 2). \n22 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n23  Gender Action Plan; Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, Poverty and Social Assessment and Social \nAction Plan; Indigenous Peoples Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). ", "9 \nthe implementation of the environmental management plan. The completed EIAs, based on \nextensive public consultations, comply with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements including ADB's \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  methods  and  standards  applied  in  the \npreparation of EIAs for the project subcomponents are in accordance with the guidelines of the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection (formerly State Environmental Protection Administration), \nand also meet national and municipal laws and regulations.24 Although adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  anticipated  during  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project,  mitigation \nmeasures and the environmental management plan are expected to mitigate these potential \nimpacts. The designs of the road and water supply subcomponents also address a range of \nclimate change issues. They do not significantly contribute to greenhouse gases or increase the \nregion\u2019s vulnerability to climate change effects, and they promote the integration of adaptation \nmeasures into roads and water supply infrastructure development at the county level. Local \nenvironmental protection bureaus will support the implementing agencies in undertaking the \nenvironmental  management  plans.  Capacity  building  in  environmental  management  will  be \nprovided for the executing agency, implementing agencies, implementing units, and district and \ncounty environmental protection bureaus. The implementing agencies have disclosed relevant \nenvironment information to the affected people through consultations during 2008\u20132009, and \nthe results and findings were used to modify the EIAs and the project design. \n \n19.  Construction  of  the  project\u2019s  subcomponents  will  necessitate  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement which have been addressed in the preparation of subproject resettlement plans. \nThe project will acquire about 163.64 hectares (ha) of land, of which 85.37 ha is classified as \ncultivated land. In addition, 46.30 ha of land, one-third of which is farmland, will be occupied \ntemporarily. Land acquisition will affect 4,238 households (17,456 persons). The project will also \nrequire the demolition of 37,059.20 square meters (m2) of residential houses, affecting 341 \nhouseholds (1,387 persons). In total, 4,952 households (20,561 persons) will be affected in \neight districts and counties. Farmers affected by land loss will be compensated or mitigated \nbased on local regulations. Compensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will \nalso be paid directly to the affected persons. Based on PRC regulations, about 1,539 affected \npersons will be given the opportunity to become urban residents. People losing housing in rural \nareas will receive cash compensation at replacement costs, or cash compensation for the \nstructure  plus  house  plots.  Economic  rehabilitation  measures  include  (i)  jobs  during  the \nconstruction and operation of the project; (ii) high-value crop production; (iii) promotion and \ndevelopment of new enterprises and self-employed secondary and tertiary businesses; (iv) \ntechnical training to the affected persons to increase their skills; and (v) special support to \nvulnerable  groups.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  30 \nsubcomponents is equivalent to CNY149.8 million in 2009 prices, including contingencies.25  \n \nF.
