THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The ensuing project will improve the efficiency of railway operations in Uzbekistan, a land-\nlocked country reliant on railway transport to sustain its socioeconomic development. The project \nwill be aligned with the following impact: Implementation of targeted programs to build affordable \nhousing, development and modernization of road transport, engineering, communications and \nsocial infrastructure.1  \n \n2.  The outcome of the project will be travel costs and environmental impacts reduced for \npassenger and freight transport throughout Uzbekistan\u2019s railway network. The outputs consist of \n(i) the procurement of 24 electric locomotives, (ii) upgrading of locomotive depots, and (iii) the \nimplementation of an updated business plan which will improve the efficiency of the public railway \n.\noperator - O\u2019zbekiston Temir Yo\u2019llari (UTY) \n \n3.  The project is expected to cost in total $211 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill provide a loan of $170 million from its regular ordinary capital resources, to finance the \nprocurement of 24 locomotives. This includes $15 million of contingency. Counterpart financing \n(from UTY and the Government) of $41 million will be used for the upgrade of locomotive depots \nto ensure the maintenance of the procured electric locomotives, cost of design and survey works, \nimplementation of the improved business plan as well as taxes and duties. Both the ensuing loan \nand this transaction TA is listed in the country operations business plan, 2017-2019 for Uzbekistan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n4.  The transaction TA (TRTA) will help the government to prepare the project, develop the \nappropriate institutional conditions to allow the sound development of the railway sector in future \nyears, and help develop the capacity to implement the ensuing project.2 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n5.  Output 1: Due diligence on the proposed project completed. The TRTA will support \nADB and UTY to conduct full due diligence of the proposed project, including technical, economic \nand financial, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards aspects. The due diligence will build \non top of, and augment the pre-feasibility study conducted by UTY for the project, and ensure that \nthe project is prepared to meet all ADB policies and requirements.  \n \n6.  The output of the due diligence exercise will be a draft report and recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP) and its linked documents. The outputs will also be shared with UTY as inputs to \nthe government\u2019s feasibility study which will be prepared by UTY to fulfill national laws and \nregulations of Uzbekistan. \n \n7.  Output 2: Updated business plan drafted. The TRTA will help UTY to develop an \nimproved business plan, which will be implemented under the ensuing project. The improved \nbusiness  plan  will  aim  to  enhance  UTY\u2019s  operational  efficiency,  including  in  the  areas  of \nlocomotive and rolling stock utilization, operational practices, timely adjustment of tariffs and \noptimization of operating expenses. The intention is for the updated business plan to be a strategic \n                                                \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2017.

A part of the business plan will also identify future investment needs of UTY, and support \nthe sound rationalization and prioritization of projects. UTY\u2019s capacity will be improved to enhance \nthe project formulation process, including through the use of better traffic demand and market \nanalysis. \n \n9.  Related  to  the  above,  the  business  plan  will  help  articulate  the  future  financing \nrequirements of UTY, and identify ways in which financing can be structured to allow UTY to \nmobilize resources in an efficient and sustainable manner. Such resources may include domestic \nfunds sourced from UTY\u2019s own revenue, Government of Uzbekistan funds, international financing \ninstitutions, and commercial financing. \n \n10.  Output 3: UTY\u2019s capacity in project preparation and implementation improved. UTY \nis  technically  highly  competent  in  executing  investment  projects,  including  those  with  high \ncomplexity. Nevertheless, UTY requires capacity building in selected areas such as safeguard \ncompliance  and  monitoring,  and  procurement  and  contract  management  for  internationally \nfinanced projects. Capacity enhancement in such areas will allow UTY to attract larger levels of \ninvestments from international financiers in future. \n \n11.  On procurement, this output will assist UTY in preparing the bidding documents for the \nelectric locomotives in full compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The principles behind \nADB\u2019s procurement rules and regulations will be thoroughly explained. Hand-holding support will \nbe provided in the preparation of bidding documents, and on the procurement process. \n \n12.  On safeguard compliance and monitoring, the output will provide hands-on support to \nUTY\u2019s staff in charge of environmental and social safeguards, so that UTY may develop full \nknowledge and understanding of ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (SPS) 2009 and associated \nrules and regulations, and is able to prepare, implement and monitor safeguard actions in full \ncompliance thereto. \n \n13.  Furthermore, the TA will support the conduct of knowledge transfer of international best \npractices on topics which are to be covered under, or related to the updated business plan as \ndescribed in paragraphs 7 to 9. Topics will be selected based on a needs assessment of UTY, \nand be delivered by consultants and/or development partners specializing in such fields. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n15.
