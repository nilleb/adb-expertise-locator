At the request of the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), technical \nassistance (TA) for capacity building of the judicial system on financial and economic laws was \nincluded in the country assistance program for 2007. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-\nfinding mission was undertaken in August 2007 for the proposed TA. The mission included a \nvisit to Kunming City in Yunnan Province, located in one of the less-developed regions of the \nPRC.  Based  on  the  mission\u2019s  findings  and  discussions  between  the  mission  and  the \nrepresentatives of the Supreme People\u2019s Court (SPC) and the National Judges College (NJC), \nan agreement was reached on the objectives, scope, terms of reference, and cost of the TA.1 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC Constitution enunciates rule of law as a fundamental guiding principle for the \ncountry.2 This was reiterated by PRC President Hu Jintao in his speech at the 17th Communist \nParty Congress in 2007, where he stressed the importance of the rule of law in elaborating on a \nnew  development  concept\u2014the  scientific  outlook  on  development. 3 Consistent  with  the \nConstitution and in light of the scientific outlook on development, the Government identified the \nneed to \u201ccomprehensively implement the rule of law as a fundamental principle and speed up \nthe construction of a socialist country under the rule of law\u201d (footnote 3). \n \n3.  The importance given to the rule of law traces its roots to reforms commenced in 1978. \nThe reforms principally focused on building an enabling economic and legal environment to \nhasten  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  development.  Thus,  during  the  past  three  decades,  the \ndevelopment of economic and commercial laws in the PRC has been unprecedented.4 \n \n4.  In its 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, the Government recognizes that an inclusive and \nsustainable growth strategy must have a balanced focus on consumption and investment, and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 July 2008. \n2  Article 5 of the PRC Constitution provides that the country is governed according to law. \n3  According to President Hu, development will be guided by a core focus on \u201cputting people first\u201d. This requires \n\u201cwork[ing]  energetically  to  build  a  harmonious  socialist  society\u201d  through  a  more  balanced  approach.  Equal \nimportance is attached to \u201cincreas[ing] the material wealth of society and constantly improv[ing] people\u2019s lives\u201d and \n\u201cguarantee[ing] social equity and justice and constantly promot[ing] social harmony.\u201d Hu Jintao, President, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Keynote Work Report, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China (15 October 2007). \n4  ADB has been providing assistance in formulating, enacting, and amending the PRC\u2019s economic and commercial \nlaws.

A fast-changing economic landscape and the upsurge of economic and commercial laws \nin  recent  years  have  their  concomitant  challenges.  Foremost  among  these  relate  to  the \nimplementation  and  enforcement  of  laws.  Increased  economic  and  commercial  activities \nresulted in an increase in the number and complexity of disputes relating to economic and \ncommercial laws. Two of the most pressing challenges for the PRC judicial system are to \nimprove the quality of adjudication of economic and commercial law-related cases, and to \nensure consistency in the application of economic and commercial laws in these cases. To \novercome these challenges, the following three activities were identified.  \n \n6.  Operationalize Written Laws through Adjudication. Many of the economic laws were \nprepared and adopted in a relatively short time in response to the rapid changes caused by the \nPRC\u2019s economic and social reforms. Due to limited time and inadequate experience, the written \nlaws tend to lack detail and specific aspects. Indeed, in some cases, the laws were deliberately \ndrafted  broadly  and  generally  to  allow  the  administrative  and  judicial  system  to  fill  in  the \nresultant gaps based on the experiences and lessons obtained during initial implementation of \nthe laws.  \n \n7.  Update Judicial Interpretations  and Develop into Coherent Jurisprudence. The \nPRC  judicial  system  comprises  four  levels  of courts:  (i) SPC,  the  highest  national  judicial \nauthority; (ii) 31 higher people's courts\u2014one in each of 30 provinces and municipalities with the \nrank of a province, plus one military court; (iii) more than 400 intermediate people's courts; and \n(iv) more than 3,000 basic people's courts.  \n \n8.  The legal system is predominantly a civil law system, with written laws and regulations \nadopted by legislative authorities as the primary source. As the highest judicial authority, SPC's \ninterpretations, decisions, and judgments directly impact decisions and judgments of lower \ncourts. In addition to issuing generally applicable interpretations of the meaning of laws, SPC \nissues judicial interpretations and specific implementation instructions directly to lower courts. \nSuch SPC interpretations, decisions, and instructions to lower courts constitute the PRC\u2019s \n\u201ccourt-made rules.\u201d These rules are disseminated to lower courts and the public through the \ngazette of the SPC (SPC Gazette).  \n \n9.  To date, PRC courts have rendered many judgments and decisions related to economic \nlaws and regulations. To ensure consistency of the judgments rendered by the many courts, \nSPC  needs  to  analyze,  update,  and  compile  these  judicial  interpretations,  decisions,  and \njudgments, and develop jurisprudential standards to aid judges in understanding the court-made \nrules relating to the field of economic and commercial law. \n \n10.  Jurisprudence is developed based on the written law and the policy thrusts behind the \nwritten law; legal tradition and precedents; regulatory focus on the transactional process; and \nthe analytical reasoning processes followed by the court system, particularly SPC. The SPC \nGazette  alone  is  not  adequate  for  developing  jurisprudential  skills.  An  intensive  collective \nlearning process that combines tutelage from highly experienced professionals, case studies, \n                                                 \n5  The National Strategy for Development of the West covers the 12 municipalities, provinces, and autonomous \nregions: Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ninxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xijiang, \nXizang, and Yunnan. \n ", "  3\n \n11.  Train  Judges,  Particularly  in  Western  Regions.  To  enhance  the  performance  of \njudges, the judicial system needs to improve the qualifications and skills of judges. Judges must \nkeep abreast of developments in the field of economic and commercial law. Currently, of the \n190,000 judges serving in PRC courts, 66% have undergraduate or higher degrees in law. The \njudicial system recruits about a 6,000 staff members annually. As an essential qualification to be \nappointed  as  a  judge,  the  PRC  Judges  Law,  as  amended  in  June  2001,  now  requires \ncandidates to have passed the national judicial examination.6 However, the majority of judges \ncurrently serving in the courts were appointed prior to the adoption of the 2001 amendment.  \n \n12.  For  less-developed  regions  in  the  PRC,  the  scarcity  of  financial  resources  is  an \nadditional difficulty in improving quality of the judiciary.7 Constrained financial resources make \nattracting and retaining high-quality judges in courts difficult in less-developed regions, where \nsalaries and benefits are lower than in more developed regions. Furthermore, the skills of \njudges in these courts are not enhanced over time as the local budget allocated to these courts \nis insufficient to send them to continuing training programs organized by NJC in Beijing. \n \n13.  The Strategy. SPC and NJC plan to develop continuing legal training programs on \nselective economic and commercial law topics, with a thematic emphasis on the jurisprudence \nof such laws and geographic expansion of training to less-developed regions. \n \n14.  To improve the qualifications and skills of judges, the Government established NJC in \n1997 with the goal of implementing a continuing legal education system. NJC has a main \ncampus  in  Beijing  and  13  branches  throughout  the  country;  10  are  under  development. \nPresently,  NJC  implements  the  following  major  training  programs:  (i) training  for  judges \nappointed after 1995 but before the introduction of the national judicial examination requirement, \nto help them pass the national examination; (ii) training for judges prior to their promotion; and \n(iii) training for judges at various levels on newly adopted laws and/or other selected topics. \n \n15.  Given the large scale of the judicial system and its limited financial means, a more \neffective intervention would be the provision of training on selected topics for judges. Such \ntraining will emphasize learning by judges of jurisprudence developed through updated court-\nmade rules. Rather than general classroom and lecture-based training programs, such training \nwill combine self study, lecturing, class discussion and debate, learning from experienced senior \njudges, and exchange of experience. Expansion of such training from the NJC central campus \nin Beijing to its local branches will do much to address the discrepancy between judicial skills in \ndeveloped and less-developed regions. Once established, the legal education system may \n                                                 \n6  Judges\u2019 Law (promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress on 28 February 1995, \neffective 1 July 1995) amended on 30 June 2001, art. 12, translated at 1995 China Law LEXIS 386.   \n7  Pursuant to Interim Measures on Financial Management of the People\u2019s Courts, the courts\u2019 budgets are allocated \nby the corresponding public finance department. The courts can only use funds within the budget. Litigation fees, \nfines, and confiscated money belong to financial funds of the Government and are submitted to the Government \ntreasury through special bank accounts. \n ", "4 \nprovide continued training for targeted trainees in the specific regions, and may select topics in \nareas not adequately covered in regular legal education.8  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the TA is expected to be the improved quality and increased consistency \nof  the  PRC  judicial  system,  particularly  for  local  courts  in  less-developed  regions,  in  the \nadjudication of cases relating to economic and commercial law. The outcome of the TA will be a \ncontinuing legal training program in economic and commercial law developed under the TA for \nfuture repetition, which will carry a thematic emphasis on the jurisprudence of such laws and \ngeographic expansion to less-developed regions through training at NJC\u2019s local branches.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA activities will be (i) development of a continuing training program on economic \nand commercial law with an emphasis on the jurisprudence of these laws, and pilot testing of \nsuch training at NJC\u2019s main campus in Beijing and local branches in the western regions; and  \n(ii) a separate but related exercise of up-to-date compilation of court-made rules in selected \nareas of economic and commercial law, and development of jurisprudence based on updated \ncourt-made rules and adjudication practices. \n \n18.  The  TA  involves  three  major  activities.  The  first  involves  the  conduct  of  advanced \nseminars by SPC\u2019s Second Civil Division. The seminars will provide a good opportunity to \nreview, summarize, analyze, update, and compile the interpretations, decisions, and judgments \nof SPC relating to economic and commercial law. Together with the senior judges in the Second \nCivil Division, seminar participants will analyze and discuss the policy thrusts behind the written \nlaw, the regulatory focus of these laws, and practical issues in implementing the laws from a \ntransactional perspective. Regulatory authorities and practitioners from the legal, investment, \nand banking subsectors will participate in the advanced seminars. The exercise will update the \njudges on the real issues encountered in structuring market transactions in accordance with the \nnew economic laws. The process will facilitate the update of court-made rules and development \nof jurisprudence relating to economic laws. The senior judges participating in the update of the \ncourt-made rules and development of jurisprudence will provide training, as resource persons, \nin the training sessions conducted by NJC.  \n \n19.  The second activity will be the development of a training program and conduct of training \nat NJC\u2019s main campus in Beijing for selected judges from courts around the country. National \nconsultants will be engaged to help NJC develop a continuing training program for judges on \neconomic and commercial law. The national consultants and other national experts will be \ninvited to give lectures to judges during the training courses. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB experience in the PRC confirms that interventions in the area of judicial training, with emphasis on practice \nand experience building, have significant positive effects on the development of the rule of law in the PRC. Under \nADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for WTO Membership and Foreign Trade Law \nReform. Manila (TA 3672-PRC, approved on 14 June), four groups of senior judges, including faculty members of \nthe courts\u2019 training institutions, were trained on World Trade Organization rules at the NJC main campus in Beijing. \nBased on the training courses provided under this TA, NJC developed and conducted a program to ensure the \ncontinuation of training programs on this subject. \n ", "  5\n20.  The  third  activity  involves  pilot  training  to  be  conducted  at  NJC  branches  in  the \nnorthwestern and southwestern regions. The trainees will be judges from the relatively less-\ndeveloped  northwest  and  southwest  regions.9The  training  program  and  the  experiences \nobtained through the training courses will help strengthen the capacity of NJC and its branches \nto continue such training at NJC\u2019s regional branches in the future.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000. ADB will provide $400,000 on a grant basis from \nthe ADB TA funding program. The ADB financing will cover the costs of (i) remuneration, per \ndiem, and international and local travel of consultants; (ii) equipment; (iii) workshops, seminars, \nand international symposiums; (iv) support for participants; and (v) contingency. An allowance \nwill be provided to trainees from poor regions. SPC and NJC, including its branches in the \nnorthwestern  and  southwestern  regions,  will  provide  a  counterpart  in-kind  contribution \nequivalent to $500,000, covering the costs for (i) counterpart staff; (ii) local communication;  \n(iii) training expenses including training venue, participants\u2019 travel and accommodation, and \norganization and administration; (iv) local transport; and (v) administration. The detailed cost \nestimate is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  SPC will be the Executing Agency for overall implementation of the TA. SPC\u2019s Second \nCivil Court will be the Implementing Agency for the advanced seminars and NJC will be the \nImplementing Agency for the training component with responsibility to implement the respective \ncomponents including monitoring the impact of the training.  \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, starting in August 2008 and ending in \nFebruary 2010. The TA will require about 5.5 person-months of national consulting services. \nADB will engage the consultants individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultants will have expertise in \neconomic  and  commercial  law,  including  contract  law,  corporation  law,  securities  law, \ninsolvency and bankruptcy law, trust law, laws on merger and acquisition, laws relating to asset-\nbased  securitization,  and  banking  and  insurance  law.  The  consultants\u2019  inputs  will  include \nparticipation  at,  and  presentations  during,  the  continuing  training  courses  and  advanced \nseminars. National resource persons, including senior judges from SPC and local courts,10 \nspecializing  in  areas  covered  by  the  training  program  will  be  invited  to  lead  the  lectures, \ndiscussions, debates, and case analysis exercises at the training courses. International and \nnational resource persons will be invited to participate in the advanced seminars. Appendix 3 \nprovides the implementation arrangements and outline terms of reference for the consultants. \nSPC will procure the equipment required under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Arrangements for advance payment facility \nand  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time) to facilitate TA administration.  \n \n                                                 \n9  This may include judges from Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ninxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, \nSichuan, Xijiang, Xizang, and Yunnan. \n10 Honorarium, travel, and accommodation costs for these judges will be covered since they will undertake the \ntraining tasks outside their normal job assignment and their court budgets are separate from NJC and its local \nbranches, with each being provided a budget from the corresponding public finance department. \n ", "6 \nIV.
