This earthquake \nhad  its  epicenter  in  neighboring  Afghanistan  with  a  recorded \nmagnitude  of  7.4  on  the  Richter  scale.  Initially,  the  landslide \nblocked the narrow waterway of the Vakhsh River approximately \n5 km downstream of the Baipaza Hydro Power Station (BHPS) in \nKhatlon Region, southern Tajikistan. As a consequence, the water \nlevel rose by about 7 meters (m), threatening to flood the BHPS. \nAlso, generation of power and supply of water for irrigation was \ndisrupted.  The  Government  took  the  immediate  measure  of \nblasting the landslide materials from the river to avoid flooding the \nBHPS. Since the first movement of 3 March, the landslide has \nbeen  moving  at  speeds  varying  between  a  few  millimeters  to \n1 centimeter a day. There is an imminent danger that sudden \nmovement of the landslide will completely block the river thus \nsubmerging the BHPS. The Project aims to restore reliable water \nflows and initiate disaster prevention measures by (i) minimizing \nthe occurrence and the magnitude of the landslide, (ii) mitigating \nits impact on the flow of the Vaskhsh River and its blockage, and \n(iii) studying a long-term solution.  \n \nRationale  Maintaining reliable water flows in the Vakhsh River is vital for \nTajikistan  and  the  downstream  countries  of  Uzbekistan  and \nTurkmenistan. Any blockage of the Vakhsh River would disrupt \nthe  generation  of  the  Vakhsh  River  cascade  comprising  five \nhydropower stations totaling 3,858 megawatts (MW) of installed \ngeneration or 90% of total generation capacity of the country. \nIn the worst case, 90% of the electricity generating capacity of \nTajikistan could be at risk. In addition, blockage of the Vakhsh \nRiver would endanger the water supply to downstream users for \nagriculture, industry, and drinking water. This would affect people \nin  the  Khatlon  Region,  and  would  disrupt  water  supply  to \nUzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Further, a sudden breach of any \nlandslide dam would pose a threat to downstream communities, \ninstallations, and infrastructure. \n   ", "iii \nObjectives and Scope  The primary objective of the Project is to restore water flows in the \nVakhsh River to at least the pre-earthquake levels and to initiate \ndisaster prevention measures. This will be done by limiting the \noccurrence  and  magnitude  of  the  landslide  and  mitigating  its \nimpact. The Project will: \n(i) part A:  carry out emergency slope stabilization measures to \nreduce the threat posed by the landslide and assist in disaster \npreparedness through observational and monitoring systems and \nearth-moving plant for river clearing operations; and \n(ii) part B: undertake a feasibility study to determine the most \ncost-effective long-term solution to the problem.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $6.65 million equivalent, of which \n$2.40 million (36%) is the foreign exchange cost and $4.25 million \nequivalent  (64%)  the  local  currency  cost.  The  cost  estimate \nincludes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  $0.7  million \nequivalent for taxes and duties.  \n \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n  Foreign  Local \nSource  Total  % \nExchange Currency \nAsian Development Bank  2.40  2.92  5.32    80 \nGovernment  0.00  1.33  1.33    20 \nTotal  2.40  4.25  6.65  100 \n \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  loan  of  SDR  4,001,000  ($5.32  million  equivalent)  will  be \nprovided  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and will have a term of 32 years with a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per year \nduring the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  to  the  Executing \nTerms  Agency through budgetary appropriations. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 May 2004 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 November 2003 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Energy \n   ", "iv \n   \nImplementation  The  Implementing  Agency  will  be  Barki  Tajik,  a  state-owned \nArrangements  electricity utility. The project implementation unit (PIU), which has \nbeen established within Barki Tajik, will be responsible for the \noverall  project  management,  including  (i)  recruitment  and \nsupervision  of  domestic  consultants,  (ii)  supervision  of \nimplementation  and  quality  control  of  the  project  works, \n(iii) monitoring and evaluation of project progress and impacts, \nand (iv) preparation of reports and communications with ADB. The \nPIU is staffed by local experts supported by domestic consultants. \nProvision has also been made for an international consultant to \nprovide assistance and training in the design and execution of the \nemergency works. \n   \nProcurement  The  Project  will  finance  civil  works,  materials,  machinery  and \nequipment,  and  technical  assistance.  Procurement  will  be  in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Mainly \nforce account and local competitive bidding will be used for civil \nworks, with some minor works to be awarded on direct selection \nbasis, taking into account the urgency of such works and the small \namount of each contract. Purchase of equipment will be based on \ninternational shopping procedures. Advance procurement action \nhas been approved, with retroactive financing from 14 April 2002 \nup to a ceiling of $800,000 equivalent. \n   \nConsulting Services  Part  A:  A  total  of  61  person-months  of  individual  domestic \nconsulting services will be required to help implement emergency \nworks  and  procurement.  Qualified  and  experienced  domestic \nconsultants are available for these engineering and construction \nworks, and will be responsible for survey investigations, detailed \ndesign, preparation of bidding documents, assistance during the \nbidding  period,  bid  evaluation  and  contract  negotiation,  work \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  environmental  monitoring  and \nevaluation. A further 4 person-months of individual international \nconsultant  services  has  been  allocated  to  assist  with  design, \nconstruction supervision, and procurement of emergency works in \nthe early stages of implementation. \n \nPart B: The services of 9 person-months of international and 33 \nperson-months of domestic consultants are required to prepare a \nfeasibility study for a long-term solution and confirm the most cost-\neffective  solution  for  maintaining  reliable  flow  of  water  in  the \nVakhsh  River.

This  risk  could \nimpact on the investment, the scheduling of the works, and the \nsafety of personnel and plant. Other risks include nonperformance \nof  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Barki  Tajik  and  its  contractors. \nFurthermore,  there  could  be  some  risk  of  regional  political \ninstability, though this is considered to be low. \n   \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Maintaining  reliable  water  flows  in  the  Vakhsh  River  is  vital  for  Tajikistan  and  the \ndownstream countries of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Any blockage of the Vakhsh River \nwould disrupt the generation of the Vakhsh River cascade comprising five hydropower stations \ntotaling 3,858 megawatts (MW) of installed generation or 90% of total generation capacity of the \ncountry. In the worst case, 90% of the electricity generating capacity of Tajikistan could be at \nrisk. In addition, blockage of the Vakhsh River would endanger the water supply to downstream \nusers for agriculture, industry, and drinking water.  This would affect people in the Khatlon \nRegion, and would disrupt water supply to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. A sudden breach of \nany  landslide  dam  would  pose  a  threat  to  downstream  communities,  installations,  and \ninfrastructure. \n \n3.  Hydropower is the major source of energy in Tajikistan and plays an important role in the \nnational economy. It accounts for well over 90% of the energy supply. Tajikistan's power system \ncomprises three separate power grids, the north, south and the Gorno-Badakhshan systems, \nwhich are operated by Barki Tajik. The installed generation capacity totals 4,354 megawatts \n(MW), including 4,000 MW of hydropower capacity. Out of this, the Cascade River plants of the \nVakhsh River represent 3,858 MW. In summer time, Tajikistan has on average an energy \nsurplus of about 4,200 gigawatts (GWh), which is exported mainly to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan \nand Uzbekistan. In wintertime, Tajikistan imports electricity from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan \nto meet the energy demand mainly for heating. All major hydropower plants are on the Vakhsh \nRiver. Nurek Hydropower station (NHPS) with 3,000 MW of installed capacity is the largest in \nCentral Asia and generates electricity throughout the year. It was constructed in stages from \n1962 to 1979, and regulates the Vakhsh River flow, on a seasonal basis, for irrigation needs of \nthe Amu Darya basin countries (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) during the growing season (May \nto July). Baipaza Hydro Power Station (BPHS), located 35 kilometers (km) downstream of \nNHPS, regulates the river flow on a daily basis and has a capacity of 600 MW. BHPS has been \nin operation since 1985. The Baipaza reservoir is used for water supply and irrigation purposes \nof nine regions with irrigated area of around 173,000 ha.1 This region covers most of the area \nsouth of Dushanbe, which has a population of more than 2 million and has been identified by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) as a poor region under the ongoing power rehabilitation project \nloan.2  \n \n                                                 \n1  Nine regions depend on the Vaskhsh River water for irrigation of a total area of around 173,000 ha as follows: \nBokhtar\u201325,795 ha; Vaskhsh\u201321,492 ha; Yavan\u201327,025 ha; Kolkhozabad\u201322,969 ha; Kumsnagir\u201324,167 ha; \nSarband\u20132,380 ha; Khojamaston\u201319,225 ha; Gozimalik\u201310,780 ha; and Jilikul\u201320,000 ha.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

On  3  March  2002  at  4:10  pm,  Tajikistan  experienced  an  earthquake  of \nmagnitude 7.4 on the Richter scale and with its epicenter in Afghanistan. The earthquake \ntriggered a mass of earth and rocks to slide into the Vakhsh River 5 km downstream of BHPS \non the Vakhsh River in Khatlon Region. The first landslide partly blocked the narrow waterway \nof the Vakhsh River, causing the water level at the landslide to rise by 7 meters (m), and \nthreatening to flood upstream BHPS. The heavy rains that followed the landslide in early March \nworsened this. Flows to the Pravaya-Vetka main canal assisted under an ADB emergency \nloan,3 could be affected by such an event. This canal is fed through a tunnel that takes water in \nfrom the reservoir of BHPS and provides irrigation supplies to 26,000 ha and provides potable \nwater to 220,000 people in three districts. Since the first movement on 3 March 2002, the \nlandslide has been moving at speeds varying from a few millimeters to 1 centimeter per day. A \nmore detailed description of the landslide is given in Appendix 1. \n \n5.  To allow the river channel to be cleared sufficiently to enable the free flow of water, the \nBHPS had to be stopped during the day and operated only partially during the night. Explosives \nwere used to remove the natural dam, and from 12 April to 22 April the BHPS was operated at \nhalf capacity, releasing water only for the minimum of irrigation requirements downstream. A \nfurther cessation of operation will be necessary to allow additional widening of the riverbed at \nthe landslide location, in order to decrease the water level at the BHPS by a further 2 m.  \n \n6.  The immediate and direct impact of future river blockages will be the disruption of power \ngeneration  in  Tajikistan  and  water  supply  for  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Uzbekistan, \nincluding for irrigation of around 173,000 ha. NHPS, as the largest hydropower station of the \nCentral  Asian  Electric  System,  is  a  significant  contributor  to  the  region's  load-frequency \nregulation. Should the Vakhsh River become blocked, the NHPS will have to cease operation \ntemporarily, and the stability of the whole Central Asian System may suffer. In addition, the \nBHPS would be submerged and severely damaged by flooding. \n \n7.  The indirect impact will be the stoppage of aluminum production, which is highly energy \ndependent. Tajik Aluminum Smelter (TADAZ), the government-owned aluminum smelter, is one \nof the largest industrial users of electricity and had a demand of about 600 MW in 2002. The \nhydropower plant of Nurek directly supplies the TADAZ factory. This factory, with a capacity \nestimated  at  390,000  tons  per  year,  exports  almost  the  entire  aluminum  production, \npredominantly  to  the  Netherlands  (49%),  Turkey  (19%),  Belgium  (13%),  and  Iran  (6%).  A \nblocking of the Vakhsh River would therefore drastically reduce foreign currency revenues for \nTajikistan. \n \n8.  Finally, if a river blockage were to occur and could not be removed quickly, then, in the \nworst case outcome, the resultant dam could eventually breach catastrophically, resulting in \ndownstream flooding and damage to livelihoods, power generation, and water supply. \n \n9.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  staff  joined  on  6  April  2002  the  site  visit \norganized by the Tajik Prime Minister and comprising heads of diplomatic missions, senior \nrepresentatives of the United Nations (UN), and international financial institutions based in \nTajikistan.  On  18  April  2002,  the  Government  sent  a  formal  request  to  ADB  for  urgent \n                                                 \n3  The project area of Loan 1852-TAJ is located in the irrigation service area of Pravaya-Vatka main canal. \n ", "3 \nassistance to stabilize the Baipaza landslide. Appraisal4 for the Project was undertaken from  \n12 to 25 June 2002, and loan negotiations with authorized representatives of the Government \nwere conducted from 12 to 14 August 2002.  \n \n10.  The  Government  acted  quickly  to  assess  the  extent  of  the  damage,  implement \nemergency measures to avoid the submersion of the BHPS, and prepare cost estimates for the \nnecessary rehabilitation works to restore the reliability of water flow in the river in the Baipaza \narea to the pre-earthquake condition. \n \n11.  The emergency rehabilitation measures are required to reduce the risk posed by the \nBaipaza landslide and to  confirm the most cost-effective long-term solution. The combination of \nemergency measures and disaster preparedness is considered  the best response to address \nthe landslide. For a long-term solution, a number of alternatives may be considered, including \nfurther improvements to slope stability and river management options that include the relief \ntunnel already proposed. Such ADB assistance to the Government would be in line with ADB's \npolicy on emergency operations as it will (i) avoid diverting the Government's development \nresources  to  address  this  natural  calamity,  (ii)  prevent  the  potentially  catastrophic \nconsequences of the still moving landslide,5 (iii) restore the full generating capacity of the BHPS \nas well as the previous water flows of the Vaskhsh River, (iv) increase the reliability of power \nand water irrigation supplies, (v) involve simple solutions that do not require a long preparation \nperiod, (vi) have the full support of the Government through its participation in the steering \ncommittee,  and  (vii)  help  evolve  an  effective  long-term  strategy  to  mitigate/eliminate  the \nlandslide impact . \n \n12.  Lessons Incorporated. The lessons learned from a number of emergency projects \nfinanced by ADB have been incorporated in the project design. Of particular relevance are the \nEmergency Flood Rehabilitation Project (EFRP)6 and the Emergency Restoration of Yavan \nWater Conveyance System Project (ERYWCSP),7 which are the two emergency loans financed \nby ADB in Tajikistan and are performing creditably. Involvement of the Government in these \nprojects has been important for their success. A similar degree of Government involvement has \nbeen built into the present project. Under the Power Rehabilitation Project approved in 2000, \nproject implementation has been slower than anticipated. There is a delay of about one year in \nrecruitment  of  the  project  implementation  consultants  due  to  the  executing  agency\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures, possibly on account of being a first-time borrower of a loan \nfrom ADB. To avoid similar problems under this Project, the same executing agency as under \nthe Power Rehabilitation Project will act as the implementing agency for this Project. The \nProject will use the same core project implementation unit (PIU) as for the Power Rehabilitation \nProject, with staff that has been trained in ADB's procedures and guidelines. Imprest account \nprocedures with initial deposit and simplified procurement procedures being proposed under this \nProject will mitigate the risk of delays in implementation of the Project.  \n \n                                                 \n4  The Mission comprised X. Humbert, Mission Leader/Energy Specialist, and G. Hearn, consultant. \n5  The landslide is still moving and 45 earthquakes of low magnitude were recorded, in the Baipaza area, in three \nmonths since the 3 March 2002 movement. \n6  ADB. 1999.

The strategic objective is to avoid severe disruptions to the economic development of \nTajikistan and to the Government's poverty reduction program, which could arise from  further \ndeterioration in the condition of the landslide. The specific project objective is to restore water \nflows in the Vakhsh River to at least the preearthquake levels and initiate disaster prevention \nmeasures.  The  project  activities  will  limit  further  damage  from  the  Baipaza  landslide  and \nmitigate its impact on the flow of water in the Vakhsh River. The project framework is given in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n14.  The Project has two parts, emergency slope stabilization and disaster preparedness, \nand study of a long-term solution for disaster prevention (details are in Appendix 3). \n \n1.  Part A:  Emergency Slope Stabilization and Disaster Preparedness \n15.  Part A is intended to minimize the immediate threat to the flow of the Vakhsh River. The \ninvestigation,  design,  procurement,  and  commissioning  of  a  long-term  solution  could  take \nseveral years to implement. Emergency measures are therefore needed to reduce the risk \nposed by the landslide during this period. This approach is proposed because it (i) recognizes \nthe scale and complexity of the landslide problem; (ii) incorporates reasonable and necessary \nprecautionary measures to reduce the rate and continuation of land slippage; and (iii) allows \npreparedness for the realistic worst case outcome should it arise during the implementation \nperiod. The two courses of action to achieve this are as follows (details shown in Appendix 4): \n \n16.  Slope Stabilization Measures. The stability of the slope will be improved to slow the \nrate of slippage. The proposed emergency rehabilitation measures comprise the following: \n \n(i)  improving and constructing access and haul roads to the site and to the proposed \nexcavation spoil disposal locations (up to 30 km of access road), \n \n(ii)  cutting back and benching the slope immediately above the landslide to reduce load \nand remove material that might otherwise fail and aggravate stability conditions \nbelow (estimated 600,000  cubic meters [m3] of material), \n \n(iii)  draining the benched cut back and the natural slopes above the landslide, and in \nparticular reducing subsurface seepage water entering the slide mass (2 km of \ndrains), \n \n(iv)  removing slipped masses, wherever practicable and desirable, from the area below \nthe current landslide to reduce load and remove material that would otherwise fail \nagain and aggravate stability conditions below (200,000 m3), and \n \n(v)  draining the middle slope of the landslide.   \n \n17.  The implementation of the above works requires the following activities: \n ", "5 \n(i)  Survey and investigation will be required to confirm the details and quantities of the \nemergency works. The survey will comprise a topographic survey of the landslide, \nthe areas to be cut back and removed, and the access to the spoil disposal sites. \nPart of this survey has been undertaken by Barki Tajik and the costs incurred since \n14  April  2002  have  been  incorporated  into  the  Project.  The  investigation  will \ncomprise geological mapping, drilling, and trial pitting to define in more detail the \nmechanics of the landslide and to yield geotechnical data to finalize the design of \nearthworks. These investigations are limited to those required to advance the design \nand implementation of the emergency works. Engineering geological mapping is \nconsidered to be the most important of the investigation activities. \n \n(ii)  Design will comprise confirming earthworks slopes and other stability calculations, \ndrainage configuration, and standard details; the detailed location and typical cross-\nsection of access roads; the layout and formation of spoil areas and the production of \ndesign drawings; general arrangement drawings; bills of quantities; specifications; \nbid documents; and contract documentation. \n \n(iii)  Road construction and improvement will comprise improving existing tracks to \nallow access to the site and to spoil areas for earth moving plant and vehicles.  \nIn most cases, a four-wheel drive track already exists, but to hasten the works, a new \nroad will be needed from the top of the landslide to the spoil areas, in order to \ndecrease haulage distances. \n \n(iv)  Earthworks  will  comprise  a  benched  cut-back  at  the  head  of  the  landslide  to \nimprove overall stability in that area and reduce potential volumes of failure. An \noutline design has already been prepared by Barki Tajik. Earthworks will also include \nthe selected removal of landslipped masses from beneath the back scar. \n \n(v)  Drainage is a key element in the stability of the entire slope and it is important that \nsteps are taken wherever practicable to prevent water from entering the landslide \nmass in the first place. Lines of concentrated subsurface flow have been identified \nand these will require excavation and discharge away from the landslide. Two types \nof drain are proposed: (a) a conventional French drain with perforated plastic pipe, \nfilter material, and backfill; and (b) a deeper open trench drain with impermeable \ninvert. \n \n18.  The above activities will be carried out under the management of the Barki Tajik PIU and \nassisted by a team of domestic consultants. The Project implementation support component will \nprovide  inputs  for  surveys,  investigation,  design,  construction  supervision,  environmental \nmonitoring, and social impact assessment. The PIU will implement the Project. The PIU will be \nsupported by 61 person-months of individual domestic consultant input.  \n \n19.  An individual international consultant will be assigned during the early stages of the \nimplementation  to  confirm  the  design  and  guide  the  implementation  of  the  works.  This  is \nconsidered to be essential given the high-risk circumstances and relative inexperience of Barki \nTajik, local consultants, and local contractors in dealing with problems of this nature and scale. \nFour person-months of foreign expert time have been set aside to cover this on-the-job training \nactivity. \n \n20.  Disaster Preparedness Measures. Because the slope may still fail due to heavy rain or \nan earthquake, improvements in disaster preparedness will allow the Tajikistan authorities to ", "6 \nrespond more quickly and effectively if the river is blocked again during the implementation \nperiod. These measures comprise the following elements: \n \n(i)  Rainfall will be monitored and the visual, survey, and photographic monitoring of \nthe slope will continue. The rain gauge will be an automatic, continuously recording \ndevice installed at the BHPS. It will allow recorded and observed movements to be \ncompared against recorded rainfall conditions.  \n(ii)  Equipment and materials will be provided to allow the Tajikistan authorities to act \nas quickly as possible to restore flow in the Vakhsh River, were it to become \nblocked or severely restricted by further movements of the Baipaza landslide during \nthe implementation period.  \n \n2.  Part B:  Feasibility Study \n \n21.  Part B will evaluate the technical feasibility and financial and economic viability of the \nlong-term solutions and options, including the construction of 1\u20132 river flow relief tunnels for \nbypassing the landslide.  \n \n22.  The feasibility study is divided into three elements: \n \n(i)  The appropriateness of the preferred solution for the management of flow through \nthe Vakhsh River at the Baipaza landslide will be confirmed, and an initial design \nmade. \n \n(ii)  Landslide hazards in the Vakhsh River corridor will be mapped. Aerial photograph \ninterpretation,  published  topographical  maps  and  geological  mapping  will  be \ncombined to prepare a landslide location map for the Vakhsh Valley (both valley \nsides) at a scale of 1:10,000, from the BHPS to approximately 25 km downstream, \nas far as the Sangtudinskaya hydropower station. A summary assessment of all \nhigh hazard slopes in this study area will be prepared, and will include their likely \neffect on the flow in the Vakhsh River and the operation of the Baipaza and \nSangtudinskaya hydropower stations. \n \n(iii)  Scope, terms of reference, and cost estimates will be prepared for the detailed \ndesign of the long-term solution. \n \n23.  The  terms  of  reference  and  implementation  program  for  the  feasibility  study  are \ncontained in Appendix 4. The study will be completed over a period of 6 months. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n24.  The Baipaza landslide is probably the largest slope failure to be affecting such high \nvalue installations in Tajikistan. Few active landslides in the world have the same dimensions as \nthat at Baipaza. That the landslide occupies a valley side that is virtually entirely composed of \nancient, though probably active landslides, is also highly significant.  \n \n25.  Another  special  feature  relates  to  the  critical  need  for  implementing  emergency \nprecautionary measures as soon as possible. It is imperative that the majority of the works are \nimplemented before the forthcoming wet season (beginning in November) and this will require \nfast-tracking the loan arrangements and critical path execution of the emergency works. The ", "7 \nprocurement of special Global Positioning System equipment that allows rapid survey is a way \nin which new technology can be used to expedite the project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n26.  The Project is estimated to cost $6.65 million equivalent, of which $2.40 million (36%) is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $4.25 million equivalent (64%) the local currency. The cost \nestimates include physical and price contingencies. A summary of the cost estimates is given in \nTable 1 and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Summary ($\u2019000) \n                \n     Costs    \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \n      Exchange  Currency  Cost   \n1.

Financing Plan \n27.  The proposed ADB loan of SDR 4,001,000 ($5.32 million equivalent) will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost of $2.40 million and $2.92 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost, or 80% of the total project cost. The provision of local cost financing is justified because of \nbudgetary  constraints  of  the  Government.  The  Government  will  meet  the  remaining  local \ncurrency cost of $1.33 million equivalent, or approximately 20% of the total project cost. The \nBorrower will be the Republic of Tajikistan.  The loan will be provided from ADB's Special Funds \nresources and will have a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \n28.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n29.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Ministry of Energy (MOE), which is \nheaded by a vice prime minister. The Implementing Agency will be Barki Tajik. Barki Tajik has \nthe principal functions of generating electricity for Tajikistan and maintaining the hydropower \nstations of the Vakhsh River Cascade. Barki Tajik, which is implementing the temporary and \nurgent  works,  has  already  established  a  PIU  in  Dushanbe  under  the  ongoing  Power \nRehabilitation Project,8 financed by ADB, and is proposing to extend it by setting up a project \nsite office in Baipaza. The PIU is staffed by local experts on a fulltime basis supported by \ndomestic consultants. Details of the PIU organization are provided in Appendix 6. The PIU will \nbe responsible for (i) the overall management of the Project, including approval of design, \npreparation and evaluation of bidding documents, award of the contracts, and procurement of \nmaterials and equipment; (ii) recruitment and supervision of consulting services; (iii) supervision \nof implementation and quality control of project works; (iv) liaison with any communities and \nvillages affected by the works; and (v) preparation of reports and communications with ADB.  \n \n30.  A steering committee will be chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge of the \nministries of transport, trade, construction, energy, industry and emergency situations, and will \ninclude senior-level representatives from the ministries of finance, energy, and environment as \nwell as from Barki Tajik. The steering committee will be responsible for coordinating all relevant \nparties involved in the project implementation, including the formulation of a long-term solution \nto landslide risks under the part B of the Project. The steering committee will meet at least once \nevery quarter.  \n \n2.   Implementation Period \n31.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 20 months, with physical completion by \nNovember 2003, on the understanding that preparatory survey and design works commence \nimmediately. The project implementation schedule (Appendix 7) shows that all of the emergency \nworks at site are scheduled to be carried out during the dry seasons (normally May-October \ninclusive) of 2002 and 2003. During the intervening wet season of 2002/03, the weather and \nground conditions are unsuitable for construction activity: this period coincides with the wettest \nperiod of the year and the period when snow cover and freezing is likely to be greatest. For this \nreason, no site works have been scheduled for this period. According to the implementation \nschedule discussed and agreed upon with Barki Tajik project officers, the only emergency \nactivities that will not be completed by then relate to the excavation and haulage from the top of \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grants \nfor the Power Rehabilitation Project. Manila. ", "9 \nthe slide. Slightly less than half of the cut-back at the top of the landslide can be achieved \nduring the dry season of 2002. Temporary drainage and erosion protection will need to be \ninstalled on the excavation terraces until the excavation is completed in 2003. The equipment to \nbe procured under part A will assist in the earthworks program. \n \n3.  Procurement \n32.  Goods and services to be financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. Contracts for supply of equipment will be procured based on \ninternational shopping procedures (with a limit of $700,000 per contract), civil works will be \ncarried out based on local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, and minor works \nwill be carried out on a force account/direct selection9 basis. A tentative procurement and \npackaging list is given in Appendix 8. \n  \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n33.  On 6 August 2002, ADB approved (i) advance action to recruit consultants and procure \nequipment and civil works; and (ii) retroactive financing of the project works effective from 14 \nApril 2002, which is the date the river was blocked by the landslide.10 Advance action for \nprocurement  and  consultant  selection  and  retroactive  financing  are  necessary  to  expedite \nproject implementation considering that the proposed works are critical taking into account the \nemergency of the situation. In particular, it is imperative that earthworks be advanced prior to \nthe onset of the next wet season. This is critical to minimize slide movement. Retroactive \nfinancing will help avoid disrupting the Government\u2019s development programs in the face of \nbudgetary constraints. The retroactive financing will be limited to loan-related expenditures \nsince 14 April 200211 until loan effectiveness, and subject to a ceiling of $0.8 million. The \nGovernment was advised that approval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing of the Project. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n34.  A total of 61 person-months of domestic consultants financed by the loan will be required \nto assist the PIU. Adequately qualified and experienced domestic consultants are available for \nthese engineering and construction works. The consultants will be responsible for surveys, \ninvestigations,  detailed  design,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  construction  supervision, \nquality  control,  environmental  monitoring,  and  social  assessment.  Field  engineers  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day supervision of contractors. An international consultant will also be \nrequired to oversee initial project establishment and procurement and to verify and approve the \ndesign. Four person-months have been allocated to this. \n \n35.  The PIU will select and engage individual domestic consultants in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The terms of reference and time inputs for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 9. The international consultant will be recruited by the PIU \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \n                                                 \n9  Given the urgency of having the work performed, and the small amount of each contract, three contracts totalling \n$64,000 have been awarded to specialist state-owned companies on direct selection basis. \n10  The advance action and retroactive financing were reported in the August 2002 edition of  ADB Business \nOpportunities. \n11 This date corresponds to the effective time when the first works were carried out by Barki Tajik on the landslide. ", "10 \n36.  Consultants for the feasibility study will comprise foreign and local specialists and will be \nprocured on a simplified procedure and quality-and-cost-based selection method through the \nsimplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants or \nother arrangements acceptable to ADB. Services of about 9 person-months of international and \n33 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed (Appendix 4). \n  \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n37.  To expedite implementation of the Project through timely release of loan proceeds, the \nGovernment will establish an imprest account promptly after loan effectiveness with an initial \ndeposit of $0.5 million equivalent. The imprest account will be established in a commercial bank, \nand will be managed and liquidated through statement of expenditure procedure in accordance \nwith ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB's statement of expenditures procedure will be \nused to reimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments not exceeding \n$50,000 equivalent each. The experience of the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation (footnote 6) \nand  the  Emergency  Rehabilitation  of  the  Yavan  Water  Conveyance  System  Projects  \n(footnote 7) shows that the Government has the capacity to maintain an imprest account and \nexpenditure record in accordance with generally acceptable accounting standards. \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n38.  MOE will maintain separate project records and accounts and will have the accounts \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Copies  of  audited  project \naccounts will be provided to ADB within six months after the end of each relevant fiscal year. \nMOE will provide brief quarterly and annual reports to ADB. These reports will indicate the \nprogress  made  and  problems  encountered,  the  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the \nproblems, and the disbursements during the period under review. In addition it will indicate the \nproposed program of activities, and the expected disbursement for the following period. Within  \n3 months of physical completion of the project, MOE will submit to ADB a completion report that \nprovides details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Review \n39.  The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review of the Project at the end \nof the first construction season, in November 2002. The midterm review will form part of the \nprocess of building a strong working relationship and will assess (i) implementation status,  \n(ii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iii)  physical  progress  made  and  disbursements  in \nrelation to the implementation schedule, (iv) performance of the consultants and contractors,  \n(v) status of compliance with the covenants stipulated in the loan agreement, and (vi) the need \nfor any additional works or changes in the project scope to take into account any further delayed \nconsequences or landslide/earthquake activities. \n \nG.  The Executing Agency and the Implementing Agency \n40.  MOE, the Executing Agency, is responsible for overseeing and coordinating activities in \nthe energy sector. The Implementing Agency, Barki Tajik, is the state-owned utility responsible \nfor generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s \nindependence, the entity was administratively a government agency. In 1992, it became a state \njoint stock holding company. Although it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys \nautonomous status according to its charter. \n ", "11 \n41.  Under the present institutional arrangement, Barki Tajik consists of a network of 10 \nsubsidiary power generation companies, 11 subsidiary distribution companies, and 8 supporting \ncompanies including a research institute and construction companies. The chairperson of Barki \nTajik, who has overall responsibility for operations, reports directly to the Prime Minister, and is \nappointed by the Government with no fixed term. The chairperson is assisted by the first deputy \nchairperson (chief engineer), who manages Barki Tajik\u2019s day-to-day operations, and six deputy \nchairpersons,  who  are  in  charge  of  the  technical  departments,  supporting  services,  and \nsubsidiary power generation and distribution companies. Since 1999, the Government has \ncreated business units for some of these subsidiaries, with ownership rights vested directly in \nthe State Property Committee on behalf of the Government but with business management \nresponsibilities assigned to Barki Tajik. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n42.  The Project aims primarily to restore reliable water flows in the Vakhsh River. For this, \nthe Project will minimize the risk posed by the Baipaza landslide to the flow of water in the \nVakhsh River and consequently the operation of the BHPS. The Project will improve long-term \nstability  and  provide  long-term  remedial  measures,  while  at  the  same  time  equipping  the \nGovernment with plant, materials, and know-how to deal with and monitor landslide movements \nin the short term. The Project will also supplement the Tajik skills in landslide studies and \nplanning for landslides. \n \n43.  The Project benefits are savings in lost output that would result from the landslide if it \nfails. Potential losses that may be incurred if the Project is not implemented are estimated as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  lost generation of $40 million, taking into account an unavailability of 24 hours for \nthe whole Vaskhsh River Cascade and an unavailability of 2 years for the BHPS as \na result of submersion; \n \n(ii)  cost of $20 million for rehabilitating the BHPS after flooding, taking into account that \n25% to 30% of the electromechanical equipment might have to be rehabilitated; \n \n(iii)  loss of revenue from TADAZ; \n \n(iv)  losses in irrigated agriculture (the Vaskhsh River irrigates 66% of the cotton fields \nof Tajikistan); and \n \n(v)  social losses as a result of disruption of potable water supply. \n \nB.  Social, Environmental, and Economic Impacts \n \n44.  The  Government  and  Barki  Tajik  have  agreed  to  put  in  place  all  necessary \nenvironmental protection and to carry out the works in accordance with the environmental law \nand regulations of Tajikistan and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. They have also agreed, and \nprovision has been made, for staff of the Ministry of Environment to be involved as advisers and \nobservers  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  works  and  the  monitoring  of  any \nenvironmental effects. \n ", "12 \n45.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  and  is  presented  in \nAppendix  10.  All  potential  impacts  identified  can  be  avoided/mitigated  by  design  and  by \nconstruction planning and supervision. The environmental condition at the site can be further \nconfirmed  by  staff  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  The  findings  indicate  that  the  negative \nenvironmental impacts of the Project can be mitigated to an acceptable level. Hence the Project \nis classified as environmental category B, which does not require a full-scale environmental \nimpact assessment. \n \n46.  No negative impact will persist during the operation phase. Moreover, positive impacts \ncan be envisaged through the restoration of water flow in the Vakhsh River and potentially \nthrough a longer term decrease in suspended solids and sediments. \n \n47.  Blockage of the Vakhsh River has distinct negative consequences downstream for the \nlivelihoods of large populations, industry, and the economy. Regardless of the details of the final \nsolution that is selected, the Project will help improve management of the Vakhsh River flow at \nBaipaza, and hence have positive social, environmental, and economic impacts. \n \n48.  The Project will not involve resettlement or land acquisition. The spoil areas are not used \nfor agriculture or habitation and are state property. The Baipaza landslide area cannot be \nreturned to productive land use in the foreseeable future. Improvements to the flow of water in \nVakhsh River, however, have major positive implications for land use and water abstraction \ndownstream. The Project has the overall aim of eventually improving the flow of water in the \nVakhsh River, which will benefit agriculture and water supply downstream. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is given in Appendix 11. \n \n49.  No human settlements are in the immediate vicinity of the landslide and therefore there \nare  no  resettlement  issues.  There  is  no  major  expropriation  of  agricultural  or  otherwise \neconomic land, and no obvious impacts on ecology. The only issue identified relates to the likely \ncontinued use of explosives to clear the river immediately after landslide movement takes place, \nand this has some negative implications, most significantly geotechnical. The construction of \naccess roads and the development of spoil disposal areas may have some physical effects, but \nBarki Tajik confirms the readiness to minimize these. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n50.  Nature Risk. A large rainstorm or prolonged period of heavy rain could be a significant \nhazard  to  the  progress  of  the  Project  and  its  applicability  given  the  new  slope  condition. \nFurthermore, an earthquake of significant intensity would endanger the progress of the Project. \nThe project design, through advance fast-track procurement procedures, an imprest fund with \nretroactive facilities, and disbursement facilities, will allow the completion of most of the initial \nactivities before the start of  the next wet season in November 2002. \n \n51.  Political Risk. The Project is near Dushanbe where the social and political situation is \ncalmer than in other parts of Tajikistan. The political risk during Project implementation is hence \nlimited also because of the short duration of the Project, which is about 20 months. The \nGovernment involvement, through its participation at a highest level in the steering committee of \nthe Project, will largely mitigate the political risk. The quick measures taken by the Government \nunder the Project will enhance political stability in Tajikistan. \n \n52.  Project Delay. Project could be delayed due to the (i) nature of the works, (ii) inability of \ncontractors  to  meet  quality  and  schedule,  and  (iii)  inexperience  of  Barki  Tajik  with  ADB's ", "13 \nprocurement procedures. The risk of project delays will be actively managed through close \nmonitoring of implementation progress by the PIU and the steering committee, and regular ADB \nreview missions. Advance procurement action, adoption of international shopping, and local \ncompetitive bidding will largely reduce the risk of delayed procurement. \n \n53.  Cost Overrun. Cost overruns could occur due to uncertainties in the precise scope and \nquantities of work. However, this is expected to be manageable, given that substantial physical \ncontingencies (13%) have been provided to mitigate the risk of cost overruns and the risk of \ncost overruns. The risk of cost overruns due to inflation is limited because of the short period of \nimplementation. \n \nV.   ASSURANCES \n54.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government, through MOE and Barki Tajik, will ensure that the Project is carried \nout in accordance with applicable Tajik environmental laws and regulations and \nADB's  environmental  guidelines.    All  necessary  environmental  approvals  and \nclearances will be obtained in a timely manner in accordance with such laws and \nregulations. The Government and Barki Tajik will also ensure that all environmental \nmitigation measures required satisfying Tajik and ADB environmental requirements \nwill be incorporated in the design and carried out during project implementation. \n \n(ii)  The  Government,  through  MOE  and  Barki  Tajik,  will  regularly  report  the \nimplementation  of  the  mitigating  measures  as  outlined  in  the  summary  initial \nenvironmental examination (Appendix 8). \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  appropriate  provisions  and  compensation \nmechanism are in place for hay and cattle fodder losses that may occur during the \nexecution of the Project. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n55.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 4,001,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan for the \nEmergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \nMYOUNG-HO SHIN \nVice-President \n \n19 August 2002 ", "14  Appendix 1 \nTHE BAIPAZA LANDSLIDE \n \n \n \n1.  On 3 March 2002, an earthquake triggered a landslide 5 kilometers (km) downstream of \nthe Baipaza Hydro Power Station (BHPS). This was the second earthquake (the first was in \n1992) at this location since the commissioning of the BHPS in 1986, although the first recorded \nfailure took place in 1968, before the BHPS was constructed. In March 1968 the landslide \ncomprised 25\u201330 million cubic meters (m3) of material and the river was blocked for 2 weeks to \nan elevation of 600 meters (m) upstream of the landslide dam (the current water level is \napproximately 565\u2013570 m and the elevation of the turbine hall at the BHPS is 581.5 m). In May \n1992, the level of the water upstream of the landslide rose to 580 m. The March 2002 landslide \nresulted in a 5 m high natural dam causing a water level rise to 572 m at the landslide and an \nincrease in water level of 7\u20138 m at the BHPS.  \n \n2.  The landslide is part of an area of ancient (probably immediately post-glacial) deep-seated \nfailure involving the entire valley side. The Baipaza landslide is approximately 1,800 m in length \nand 800 m wide at its widest part, alongside the River Vakhsh. The landslide has a shape and \nmechanism of movement similar to an egg timer. The upper part is a wide source area of failing \nground whereby large masses of slope are detached progressively. These masses rapidly find \ntheir way through the narrow throat of the landslide and are deposited onto a large colluvial mass \nof material that forms the entire lower slope adjacent to the river. The depth of this mass is about \n30\u201340  m.  Slippage  is  continuing  due  to  loading  from  failing  materials  and  the  build  up  of \ngroundwater during the wet season. Due to the control of flow in the river by the upstream power \nstations (Baipaza and Nurek), river scour of the toe of the slope is unlikely to be as severe as it \nmight otherwise have been prior to construction of the installations.  \n \n3.  The total volume of the landslide is unknown, but is estimated by Barki Tajik to be  \n5 million to 25 million m3. The Mission\u2019s observations suggest that the landslide might be of the \norder of 7 million to10 million m3. The current speed of landslide movement is estimated to be in \nthe range of 0.7 to 1.0 centimeter (cm) per day, which is a dry season rate, and rates of \nmovement in the forthcoming wet season are anticipated to be much higher. \n \n4.  It  is  impossible  to  say  when  and  to  what  extent  the  next  failure  will  occur.  Slope \nmovement will be governed significantly by the rainfall pattern and the timing and magnitude of \nseismic activity. The failure of approximately 350,000 m3 is imminent in the mudslide at the \nnorthern end of the landslide adjacent to the river. If only a third of this material reaches the \nwaterway, it could block the river to a similar depth as the slide in 1968 (30 m). Such a failure \ncould also activate a much larger unstable area immediately upslope with a volume approaching \n1 million m3 or more. All of this material is not likely to be deposited in the river instantaneously. \nIf the rainfall conditions over the next few years remain low to moderate, and the area is not \naffected by any significant seismic or blasting activity, then slope failures during the short term \ncould  be  relatively  small,  especially  if  the  proposed  works  at  the  top  of  the  slide  are \nimplemented rapidly and effectively. However, the future behavior of the landslide, even over  \n1\u20133 years cannot be predicted with any certainty, and a large failure could occur. Therefore, the \nmonitoring of movements on the slide should be expanded and extended to record the details of \nmovements during the forthcoming and following wet seasons and a rain gauge should be \nestablished this dry season at the BHPS to compare movements against recorded rainfall.

Background \n \n1.  The Baipaza Landslide is approximately 60 kilometers (km) southeast of Dushanbe the \ncapital.  The  landslide  was  reactivated  following  the  earthquake  of  3  March  2002.  This \nearthquake had its epicenter in Afghanistan and was measured there at 7.4 on the Richter \nscale. Heavy rain also occurred in the Baipaza area during March and April 2002, and this \nserved to reduce the stability of the slope further. The Baipaza landslide forms part of an area of \nancient  landslides  occupying  the  western  valley  side  of  the  Vakhsh  River,  and  recorded \nreactivated movements at Baipaza have occurred in 1968, 1992, and 2002. The river below has \nbeen temporarily blocked or partly blocked on all three occasions. The Baipaza Hydro Power \nStation (BHPS) is on the Vakhsh River approximately 5 km upstream of the landslide. The \nMarch  2002  slope  movements  temporarily  blocked  the  river,  thus  disturbing  the  normal \noperation of the BHPS. Landslide debris was removed from the restricted river channel by \nblasting, but the channel remains narrow and further landslide movements will create operating \nproblems for the power station and in the worst case could submerge it. Together, the Baipaza \nand  the  Nurek  hydropower  stations,  further  upstream,  produce  90%  of  the  total  electricity \nproduction in Tajikistan. Furthermore, blockage or otherwise restricted flow in the Vakhsh River \nhas significant implications for water resources and water abstraction downstream, where an \nestimated 650,000 people depend partly or fully on the Vakhsh River for water supply. The \ndevelopment of a cost-effective and sustainable solution is therefore imperative.  \n \n \nB.  Scope of the Feasibility Study \n \n2.  The feasibility study is divided into three elements. \n \n1.  Identification of the Preferred Implementation Strategy for Managing the \nBaipaza Landslide/Vakhsh River Problem \n \n3.  The flow in the Vakhsh River must be maintained at a satisfactory level. The operational \nrequirements of BHPS and the water abstraction facilities downstream are the principal concern. \nFurthermore, the hazard posed by a potential sudden breach of any future blockage needs to be \nconsidered. Barki Tajik has already identified a possible solution consisting of the construction \nof tunnels in the opposite bank of the river. This solution has to be studied, but a range of \noptions will be identified by the feasibility study and these should be assessed on geological, \nengineering, environmental, and economic grounds to confirm the most appropriate course of \naction. The following activities, inter alia, will be required: \n \n(i)  Collect and interpret all existing data, including \n(a)  aerial photographs at 1:30,000 scale flown in 1991; \n(b)  topographical  mapping  of  the  post  March  2002  earthquake  landslide  at \n1:1,000 and 1:2,000; \n(c)  geological mapping of the general area at 1:50,000 scale; \n(d)  engineering geological and geomorphological mapping outputs undertaken \nmost notably in 1993 and 2002 and available through the Ministry of Energy; ", "  Appendix 4         19 \n(e)  ground investigation and slope monitoring data collected following the March \n2002 landslide; \n(f)  hydrometeorological  analysis  of  the  area,  including  river  discharge  and \nprecipitation data; and \n(g)  liaison  with  all  relevant  government  departments  through  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy. \n \n(ii)  Assure the following fieldwork and surveys are done: \n(a)  engineering geological/geomorphological mapping of the landslide at 1:1,000 \nscale; \n(b)  ground  investigation  to  confirm  the  feasibility  and  cost  estimate  of  the \npreferred option; \n(c)  initial environmental examination of all options identified according to Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  guidelines  and  in  association  with  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment, Tajikistan; \n(d)  initial poverty and social assessment in accordance with ADB Guidelines: the \nissues related to involuntary resettlement and indigenous people will be part \nof the assessment; \n(e)  additional topographical mapping required to identify, define and evaluate the \nvarious options (1:10,000 scale mapping already exists for the general area); \nand \n(f)  hydrological  study  of  the  Vakhsh  River  regime  in  relation  to  the  options \nidentified. \n \n(iii)  Provide  the  following  engineering,  economic,  and  environmental  analysis  of \nalternatives: \n(a)  carry  out  all  analysis  required  to  confirm  feasibility  and  cost  estimate  of \npreferred solution; \n(b)  prepare outline design for preferred solution; \n(c)  assess the possible means of financing the implementation of the proposed \nsolution; \n(d)  prepare the following reports (i) inception report; (ii) monthly progress reports; \n(iii) report on initial environmental examination and initial poverty and social \nassessment;  (iv) draft final report in English and Russian; (v) final report in \nEnglish  and  Russian;  and  (vi)  scope,  terms  of  reference,  resource/cost \nestimate and implementation schedule for detailed design. \n \n2.  Landslide Mapping in the Vakhsh River Valley \n \n4.  Combine field reconnaissance, aerial photograph interpretation, published topographical \nand geological mapping to prepare a landslide map for the Vakhsh valley (both valley sides) at \n1:10,000 from the BHPS for a distance of approximately 25 km downstream as far as the \nSangtudinskaya hydropower station. Prepare a summary assessment of all high hazard slopes \nin this study area and their likely effect on the flow in the Vakhsh River and the operation of the \nBaipaza and Sangtudinskaya hydropower stations. \n \n3.  Preparation for Detailed Design \n \n5.  Prepare terms of reference, program, and resource/cost estimate for detailed design. \n \n ", "20  Appendix 4 \nC.  Team Composition \n \n6.  The consultants will designate a fully qualified engineer to act as the team leader, who \nwill be responsible to the project manager for performance of the consulting services. The team \nleader will preferably have experience in landslide related projects in this type of terrain. The \nteam  leader  would  also  be  an  experienced  civil  engineer  and  proficient  in  using  project \nmanagement software and be highly computer literate. In addition to the team leader, the \nconsultants will provide an engineering geologist, a geotechnical engineer, an economist, a \npoverty and social development specialist, and an environmental specialist. The international \nconsulting  firm  will  team  up  with  domestic  consultants  with  expertise  in  civil  engineering, \ngeology, hydrology, land and quantity surveying, and CAD operation. In addition the domestic \nconsulting firm will provide assistance and logistic in terms of secretary and translation. A total \ninput  of  9  person-months  of  international  consultant  and  33  of  domestic  consultant  are \nanticipated.  \n \nD.  Implementation Schedule \n \n7.  The  anticipated  duration  is  6  months.

Introduction \n \n1.  A domestic team of consultants (the consultants) will be responsible to the Project \nImplementation Unit (PIU) to develop and implement a comprehensive Project management \nplan to ensure the most efficient, timely, and economical implementation of the Emergency \nBaipaza Landslide Stabilization Project. The domestic team will be assisted by 4 person-months \nof foreign consultancy during the early stages of the Project. The Project, to restore reliable \nwater flows in the Vakhsh River, comprises two components: (i) slope stabilization measures, \nand, (ii) disaster preparedness measures. The latter comprises principally the procurement of \ntools and equipment. The consultants will be responsible for surveys, investigations, detailed \ndesign, preparation of tender documents, assistance during evaluation of bids and contract \nnegotiations, construction supervision, quality control, and environmental monitoring. The field \nengineers will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of various contractors. \n \n2.  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  Barki  Tajik,  the  Implementing  Agency,  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe list of consultants to be engaged is in Table A9. \n \n3.  While it will be up to the Barki Tajik to select the best consultants and counterpart staff to \ncarry out the design and construction supervision, the Baipaza landslide team must be selected \nfrom candidates with the appropriate background and experience. The implementation of the \nemergency works will be complex and not without risk and therefore it is essential that project \nstaff  are  fully  committed  to  site  inspection  and  quality  control.  Although  a  breakdown  of \nanticipated quantities that comprise the detailed scope of works was prepared, the works have \nstill  to  be  designed  and  there  remains  some  uncertainty  over  exactly  how  they  will  be \nimplemented.  Resolving  this  will  require  further  engineering  geological  assessment. \nExperienced geological staff must therefore feature strongly in the design and supervision team. \nTable A9: Local Consulting Services Required \n \nRate  \nExpertise  Person-Months  Amount \n($/month) \n     Team Leader/Civil Engineer  14  2,100  29,400 \n     Land Surveyor  6  1,800  10,800 \n     Inspector of Works (2)  21  1,700  35,700 \n     Environmentalist  4  1,900  7,600 \n     Geologists  16  1,900  30,400 \n     Reporting and Miscellaneous    Lump Sum  10,000 \n    123,000 \nTotal  61 \n \n \n4.

The survey and investigation tasks are to \n \n(i)   carry out the required topographic surveys, \n(ii)  carry out the required geological surveys, \n(iii)  carry out ground investigation of the proposed excavation and spoil areas (trial \npits and shallow boreholes), \n(iv)  design the drainage, \n(iv)  prepare technical specifications and tender documents for investigation work, \nand  \n(v)  supervise execution of investigations. \n \nC.  Project Detailed Design and Tender Documents \n \n6.  The consultants will \n \n(i)  prepare the technical specification for procurement of goods under the disaster \nresponse measures; \n(ii)  using survey and investigation results, carry out analysis and prepare detailed \ndesign for the project works; \n(iii)  prepare  general  arrangement  construction  drawings  and  standard  details, \nspecification, and bill of quantities suitable for inclusion in the bidding documents; \n(iv)  prepare bidding documents for civil works and supply of material in accordance \nwith the relevant ADB guidelines; \n(v)  prepare prequalification documents following relevant ADB guidelines; and \n(vi)  prepare draft advertisements and letters of invitation, and assist the Ministry of \nEnergy during bid evaluation and award of contracts. \n \nD.  Construction Supervision  \n7.  The consultants will  \n(i)  develop and implement a program of effective construction supervision including \ninspection of materials, equipment, and other goods; \n(ii)  maintain a permanent presence at site during contractors' working hours for \nconstruction  supervision  and  contract  administration,  including  contractors' \nclaims and variation orders; \n(iii)  review  and  approve  the  engineering  design  drawings,  calculations,  delivery \nprogram, and documents submitted by the contractors; \n(iv)  monitor the execution of the Project in line with the project time schedule and \nwith the work program provided by the contractors; \n(v)  advise the PIU and seek for approval from ADB for any variation orders to be \nissued to the contractors; \n(vi)  identify  any  problem  areas  during  project  implementation,  propose  remedial \naction, and promptly report any outstanding issues to PIU management; \n(vii)  maintain continued assessment of geological conditions during construction and \nreport the implications of any adverse/unforeseen ground conditions immediately \nto the PIU; \n(viii)  maintain close monitoring of slope stability during construction; \n(ix)  conduct  regular  meetings  with  the  PIU  and  the  contractor  during  all  the \nimplementation phase; ", "Appendix 9         27 \n(x)  advise the PIU on any contractual or technical disputes that may arise between \nthe contractor and the PIU during the implementation phase; \n(xi)  coordinate  safety  measures  between  components  under  operation  and \ncomponents under rehabilitation;  \n(xii)  control certification of the procured goods and issue them as needed; \n(xiii)  prepare and issue the provisional acceptance certificate for the works and goods; \nand \n(xiv)  help the PIU prepare quarterly reports and a project completion report. \n \nE.  Specific Implementation Issues \n \n8.  The anticipated program of investigation, design, and construction supervision is shown \nin Appendix 7. Notwithstanding this program, all surveys and investigations are intended to \nadvance the design, scheduling, and implementation of emergency works as soon as possible. \nThe  PIU  will  be  in  control  of  the  timing  and  staffing  of  these  activities.  Geological  and \nengineering personnel who are well experienced in the studies carried out on the Baipaza \nlandslide so far, must be deployed to the maximum extent possible in this Project.  \n \n9.  The following activities are among the most critical to the implementation of the works: \n \n(i)  Carry out a site visit with contractors who will bid for the works. Indicate to them \nwhat is required and discuss practicability, scope and working methods.  \n(ii)  Finalize the locations of spoil areas and access routes. Carry out necessary \nsurvey  and  design  and  prepare  documentation  to  allow  a  contractor  to \ncommence access improvements as soon as possible. \n(iii)  Prepare a detailed engineering geological/geomorphological map of the landslide \nat 1:1,000 scale and plot cross-sections to help assess depths and extent of \nmovement.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Baipaza landslide project is on the Vakhsh River in southern Tajikistan. Landslide \nmovements have blocked the river on three occasions in the recent past and on the last two \noccasions (1992 and 2002) this has given rise to disruption of hydro power generation at the \nBaipaza Hydro Power Station (BHPS) location upstream. In addition, the Vakhsh River is critical \nto the supply of irrigation and potable water over a large area downstream, covering three \nregions of Tajikistan and neighboring countries.  \n \n2.  The Baipaza landslide is approximately 1.8 kilometers (km) long and 0.8 km wide. The \npurpose of the Project is to reduce the risk posed by the landslide to the flow of water in the \nVakhsh River, thus enabling more efficient power generation at BHPS and the maintenance of \nflow in the Vakhsh River for the benefit of downstream users. \n \n3.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken during the appraisal mission \nin June 2002 and the findings are presented hereafter. The mission visited the Baipaza site and \nheld discussions with Tajik government agencies, local government representatives, Barki Tajik \n(the  state  power  company)  representatives,  and  the  Ministry  of  Environment.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  classified  the  Baipaza  landslide  project  as  environmental  \ncategory B.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n4.  The description of the project is given in paragraphs 14 to 23 of the main text. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n5.  The  Baipaza  landslide  is  on  the  western  valley  side  of  the  Vakhsh  River,  5  km \ndownstream of the BHPS. The Vakhsh River is a major tributary of the Pyenj River and is \norientated approximately north to south. The underlying geology comprises limestones, marls, \ngypsums, and clays, overlain by thick loess soils and colluvium and there is evidence that \nwidespread deep-seated landslides have occurred in pre-historic times on the slopes occupied \nby the Baipaza landslide and immediately to the north. The area is seismically highly active.  \nA large earthquake with an epicenter in neighboring Afghanistan triggered the failure of the \nslope in March 2002.  \n \n6.  The climate is Continental, characterized by cold winters and warm-hot summers. The \nwet season is between November and April and average annual rainfall is about 600\u2013800 \nmillimeters, though there are no raingauges within 10 km of the site. \n \n7.  The  Baipaza  landslide  site  is  accessed  only  via  tracks  from  the  north  and  west. \nNumerous tracks in the area once provided access for farm tractors. \n \n  2.  Ecological Resources \n \n8.  Tajikistan  is  a  center  of  biological  diversity.  However,  half  a  century  of  resource \ndepletion and exploitation focusing on hydropower and cotton has resulted in drastic alteration \nof habitats, and large losses in terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. The Tiger Bulk Reserve is ", "30  Appendix 10 \nsome distance downstream of Baipaza and is dependent on the flow of water in the Vakhsh \nRiver. Discussions with the Ministry of Environment did not identify any known issues or fragile \necologies that might be at risk from the implementation of emergency works at Baipaza. There \nare no forest areas likely to be affected by the proposed emergency works. \n \n  3.  Human and Economic Development  \n \n9.  The immediate area was evacuated in the 1940s when a landslide on an adjacent slope \nresulted in two fatalities. Since then some villagers have returned to the area, but none have \nrelocated in the immediate area of the Baipaza landslide.  \n \n10.  Generally, the upper valley side slopes are gently undulating while the middle and lower \nslopes are steeply inclined. This pattern is most pronounced on the slopes occupied by the \nlandslide and the area to the south of it. The upper slopes are well drained and suitable for the \ncultivation of wheat. In fact, local accounts suggest that the area was an important wheat \ngrowing area in previous years. Presently, most of the cultivable land is dedicated to hay and \nfodder for cattle.  \n \n11.  Most of the area around the Baipaza landslide is covered with grass. The landscape is \nwithout trees.  A water supply pipe was previously operational along the ridge top above the \nBaipaza landslide, but is no longer functional  and has been vandalized. \n \n12.  The only industry evident in the area is the salt extraction and processing plant to the \nnorthwest. This plant extracted brine from deep groundwater for processing but now appears to \nbe not functioning. \n \n  4.  Quality of Life Values \n \n13.  Very few people live within the vicinity of the landslide. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n14.  The  framework  shown  in  Table  A10  summarizes  the  environmental  screening \nundertaken. All potential negative impacts are considered to be of low significance, as long as \nthe recommended precautionary measures are put in place. \n ", "Appendix 10       31 \n \nTable A10.1:  Initial Environmental Examination Summary Framework \n \n \nActions Affecting  Damages to Environment and  Improvements to  Recommended Feasible \nEnvironmental  Significance of Impact  Environment  Protection Measures \nResources and   \nValues \n       \n1.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n15.  The Government and the Ministry of Energy (MOE) have agreed to put in place all \nnecessary  environmental  protection  and  to  carry  out  the  works  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental legislation of Tajikistan. They have also agreed, and provision has been made, \nfor staff of the Ministry of Environment to be involved as advisers and observers in the design \nand implementation of the works and the monitoring of any environmental effects. \n \nE.  Findings And Recommendations \n \n16.  The contractor will need to establish an operational safety plan, and to demonstrate \ncompliance  with  international  safety  standards  required  for  the  operation  of  a  potentially \nhazardous site. In addition, MOE will report on a regular basis on environmental management \nand implementation of the mitigating measures in the spoil area and the slope protection. \n \n17.  Considering the urgency of processing the emergency loan Project, it is recommended \nthat this report will suffice as both the IEE and summary IEE report. All potential impacts \nidentified can be avoided/mitigated by design and by construction planning and supervision. \nFurther confirmation of the environmental condition at the site can be undertaken by staff of the \nMinistry of Environment. \n \n18.  The findings indicate that the negative environmental impacts of the Project can be \nmitigated to an acceptable level. Hence it is recommended that the project be classified as \nenvironmental  category  B,  which  does  not  require  a  full-scale  environmental  impact \nassessment. \n \n19.  No negative impact will persist during operation phase. Moreover, positive impacts can \nbe envisaged through the restoration of water flow in the Vakhsh River and potentially through a \nlonger term decrease in suspended solids and sediments.  \n \n20.  The Project will not involve resettlement or land acquisition. \n \nF.  Conclusions \n \n21.  As the adverse environmental consequences resulting from the Project can be mitigated \nto  an  acceptable  level,  and  the  other  technical  alternatives  to  address  the  objectives  are \napparently feasible, this IEE and summary SIEE report is recommended to be sufficient. Further \nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. \n \n22.  An environmental monitoring plan should however be established to ensure that all \ndispositions will be and have been taken for mitigating the adverse impacts. \n \n23.  A  program  should  be  established  under  the  Project,  to  address  the  environmental \nawareness,  mitigation,  monitoring,  and  financing  issues  in  a  manner  acceptable  for  an \nemergency project. \n ", "Appendix 11        35 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

Out of 6 million of Tajikistan\u2019s population,  \n83% are below the poverty line. A blockage of the river will have catastrophic consequences on  \n(i) the supply of electricity (import of electricity costs more than 10 times the generation costs);  \n(ii) the agriculture, as the Khatlon Region is highly productive in cotton (main resources of foreign \nexchange for the country), and (iii) the water supply. In such circumstances, the poor will not have any \naccess to electricity and water. A lack of irrigation will lead to more unemployment as agriculture \nrepresents (in 2000) around 60% of the total employment in the country.  \nThe Project, by restoring the water flow of the river, will enable power generation to fuller capacity, and \nsecure water supply and irrigation for agricultural needs of this part of Tajikistan. \n \nC.
