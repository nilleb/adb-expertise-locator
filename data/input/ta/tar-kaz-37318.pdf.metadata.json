The Government of Kazakhstan (the Government) has requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to improve governance in support of financial \nsector development. A Mission visited Kazakhstan from 3 to 9 August 2004 to undertake an \ninitial needs assessment and design a TA to address some of the governance issues in the \nsector. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, \ncost estimates, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The logical \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n    \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In recent years, the Government has embarked on significant reforms in the financial \nsector. A key measure in this direction was taken in January 2004 with the establishment of an \nindependent  financial  sector  regulator  and  supervisor  for  bank  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions, i.e., the Agency on Regulation and Supervision of Financial Markets and Financial \nInstitutions in Kazakhstan (FSAK). This was preceded by measures to improve the soundness \nof the banking system: capital requirements have gradually been raised and the framework for \nmarket entry and exit has been put in place. A deposit insurance system was also created in \n1999 to improve confidence in the banking system and to mobilize savings. The infrastructure \nfor domestic equity and bond markets has been established. A fully funded pension system was \nsuccessfully launched in 1998. Favorable macroeconomic developments, including a significant \nincrease in revenues from export of natural resources, have facilitated these reforms. As a \nconsequence, financial intermediation has increased, with the ratio of broad money to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growing from 14% in 1999 to 22% in 2003. Financial sector indicators \nand key macroeconomic indicators are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \n3.  Notwithstanding  these  positive  developments,  the  financial  sector  in  Kazakhstan \nremains largely underdeveloped. The recent gains achieved were mainly due to improvement \nfrom a relatively low base. The domestic securities market, for instance, has yet to become a \nrelevant source of financing for the entire enterprise sector. In 2003, corporate bond and equity \nissuance  together  amounted  to  only  0.8%  of  GDP.  With  limited  domestic  investment \nopportunities,  an  increasing  proportion  of  funds  accumulated  under  contractual  savings \nschemes is invested abroad. On the other hand, bank lending has grown rapidly. However, \nmore  recently,  the  quality  of  bank  loans  has  deteriorated:  39%  of  the  loan  portfolio  was \nclassified as substandard, doubtful, or loss at the end of 2003, compared with 23% at the end of \n2000. As important, the growth of household deposits has lagged behind the overall growth of \nbank lending due to lack of confidence in banks. Banks have increasingly relied on external \nborrowing to meet the growing demand for lending. This has created risks (due to currency \nmismatch) in the financial system, as seen in Asia before the 1997 financial crisis. To minimize \nthis vulnerability, the authorities will have to promote a more balanced development of the \nfinancial sector to enable the sector to mobilize domestic resources and channel them, as well \nas growing revenues from exports of oil and minerals, into investment projects in other sectors \nof the economy. \n \n4.  Recognizing these weaknesses in the financial system, the authorities aim to bring \nregulation and supervision fully in line with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking \nSupervision,  the  Objectives  and  Principles  of  Securities  Regulation  established  by  the \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO),  and  the  Principles  of  the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 July 2004.   ", "2 \nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) by 2007.2 Full compliance would also \nlay the groundwork for Kazakhstan to move closer to its goal of becoming a financial hub in the \nbroader Central Asian region. \n \n5.   To ensure overall macroeconomic and financial stability, the authorities are also seeking \nto establish a monetary policy based on an inflation-targeting3 framework. This is being pursued \nwith the objectives of (i) anchoring inflationary expectations, thereby increasing predictability of \ninterest rate setting; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the economy to absorb exogenous shocks, \nincluding those stemming from changes in terms of trade; and (iii) increasing the liquidity and \nvariety of traded securities. Introducing inflation targeting requires technical preparation. First, \nthe money market must be developed to ensure market depth and liquidity for effective pricing \nof  demand  and  supply  of  loanable  funds.  Second,  infrastructure  needs  to  be  developed, \nincluding a suitable economic model to support the decision making of the National Bank of \nKazakhstan (NBK) by showing how changes in NBK\u2019s policy variables affect the economy. \nFurther,  market  surveys  gauging  inflationary  expectations  must  assess  enterprise  and \nhousehold perception of future inflationary trends. \n \n6.   With  respect  to  national  wealth,  the  authorities  are  stepping  up  efforts  to  improve \ngovernance for better management of official reserves and the rapidly growing National Fund by \nNBK. This fund was established in 2001 to absorb and stabilize the Government\u2019s excess oil \nrevenues  and  preserve  them  for  future  generations.  At  the  end  of  2003,  official  reserves \ntogether with the National Fund amounted to $8.7 billion, or 29% of GDP. As such, NBK is the \nlargest  institutional  investor  in  Kazakhstan.  To  meet  this  challenge,  NBK  aims  to  further \nstrengthen its governance by improving accountability and preventing fraud and corruption. The \nmechanism for establishing and implementing NBK\u2019s investment policy is not yet in line with \ninternational best practices. For instance, no policy or formal mechanism exists for monitoring \nthe recruitment, performance, and dismissal of external asset managers. No formal mechanism \nexists to ensure that internal asset management is in line with a particular investment policy. \nNBK\u2019s internal audit frequently notes violations of limits and investment guidelines. Further, no \npolicy is in place on ethics or conflict of interests that prevents NBK\u2019s traders from abusing \nconfidential information. NBK has no integrated and automated system for risk management. No \nindependent risk management unit exists to support the work of the recently established risk \nmanagement committee. \n \n7.   As a step to address key constraints on the financial sector, the Government established \nin June 2004 an interministerial commission to prepare a financial sector development strategy. \nThe  Government,  through  NBK  and  FSAK,  has  also  requested  ADB  for  advisory  TAs  to \nstrengthen governance in the financial sector to promote the development of the sector. As \nfinancial resources are available overall, the primary interest is in knowledge products that \nensure the efficient use of resources. The request is in line with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram  (CSP)4  for  Kazakhstan.  The  increasing  importance  the  Government  attaches  to \nstrengthening  financial  sector  governance  has  been  acknowledged  in  ADB\u2019s  2004  CSP \nUpdate5. \n \n                                                \n2  The Financial Sector Assessment Program of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank concluded \nthat\u2014in early 2004\u20146 out of 25 Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision were materially not \ncomplied with. The assessment also identified remaining weaknesses as measured against IOSCO and IAIS \nprinciples. \n3  Inflation targeting is a framework for policy decisions in which the central bank makes an explicit commitment to \nconduct monetary policy to meet a publicly announced numerical inflation target within a particular time frame.  \n4  ADB. 2003.

To support the Government\u2019s initiatives, it is proposed that ADB provide three TAs from \n2004 to 2007. The first TA (proposed for 2004) will help the Government (i) introduce inflation \ntargeting to stabilize overall inflation and (ii) strengthen the governance of the National Fund \nand official reserves to prevent fraud and corruption. The second TA (proposed for 2005) will \nincrease compliance with international regulatory and supervisory standards for the financial \nsector, and the third (2006) will help the Government implement the remaining part of its \nfinancial  sector  development  strategy.  The  sequencing  of  the  TAs  is  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s priority and request. All three proposed TAs will complement the regional TA for \nfinancial sector development.6  \n \n9.   The  Mission  has  been  closely  coordinating  with  other  development  partners  of \nKazakhstan. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided assistance totaling 2 person-\nmonth in September 2004 to provide a second opinion on pre-conditions for inflation targeting \nand to strengthen banking sector regulation, but is not planning further assistance for NBK or \nFSAK. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) formally ended its \nassistance in the banking area in December 2003. Further assistance planned by USAID for \nconsolidated supervision will not exceed 3 person-months. The European Union and World \nBank are not planning to assist the financial sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will support the strengthening of the monetary framework by developing an \ninflation-targeting regime to ensure overall financial stability. Inflation targeting will enable the \nmonetary  authorities  to  effectively  implement  monetary  stabilization  policies  according  to \ninternational  best  practices.  Inflation  stabilization  will,  in  turn,  support  broad  efforts  of \nmacroeconomic stabilization and create an environment conducive to stable economic growth. \nThe TA will support strengthening governance for financial assets managed by NBK, which \ninclude official reserves and the National Fund, by designing rules and procedures governing \nresponsibilities and investment guidelines. Transparent management and proper oversight of \nthese assets are crucial to prevent fraud, corruption, and the exploitation of the country's \nnonrenewable resources, and to support equitable transfer of resources to future generations to \nenhance the country\u2019s development.  \n \n11.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  include  (i)  an  inflation-targeting  monetary  policy  regime \nestablished in line with international best practices; (ii) asset and risk management systems of \nNBK  in  line  with  international  best  practices;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  for  NBK  in  asset \nmanagement, risk management, and inflation targeting. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA methodology will comprise comprehensive diagnostic assessments of capacities \nneeded for inflation targeting and governance of financial assets managed by NBK. Knowledge \ntransfer  will  include  training,  procurement  of  information  technology  (IT)  equipment, \ndissemination seminars, and three study tours. The TA will undertake the following activities \nunder these two main components: \n \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003.

Developing an Inflation-Targeting Regime  \n \n13.  This component will entail the following:  \n \n(i)  Capacity and needs assessment for inflation-targeting monetary policy, including \nan assessment of the monetary policy framework, its medium-term strategy and \nshort-term stance, and its supporting operational strategy, especially with regard \nto open market operations. \n(ii)  Assessing  the  suitability  of  the  current  measure  of  core  inflation  as  a  key \nindicator for inflation targeting, defining price stability, and recommending the \ndegree of transparency and accountability required to support inflation targeting.   \n(iii)  Developing an economic model that supports monetary policy decision making \nunder an inflation-targeting policy regime and a concept for a new monetary \ntransmission mechanism.  \n(iv)  Establishing household and enterprise surveys to adequately capture inflationary \nexpectation.  \n(v)  Developing a concept and procedures for an NBK communication policy that \nensures  market  discipline  and  consistency  of  monetary  policy  decisions. \nEstablishing  supporting  market  infrastructure,  such  as  timely  and  reliable \npublication  of  economic  data,  to  help  market  participants  gauge  inflationary \ntrends. \n(vi)  Knowledge  transfer  and  capacity  building  for  an  inflation-targeting  monetary \npolicy, including training, development or purchase of IT systems and tools, one \nstudy tour, coaching, and one dissemination seminar. \n  \n  2.  Strengthening Management of the National Fund and Foreign Reserves \n \n14.  This component will entail the following:  \n \n(i)  Capacity  and  needs  assessment  for  management  of  the  National  Fund  and \nofficial reserves by NBK against international best practices, particularly with \nrespect to accountability, transparency, audit, risk diversification, and rate of \nreturn.  \n(ii)  Developing  proposals  and  a  time-bound  action  plan  for  establishing  an \ninvestment policy, asset management, and risk management oversight structure \nin  NBK  in  line  with  international  best  practices  and  reflecting  the  degree  of \ntransparency and accountability required. \n(iii)  Technical  support  to  implement  the  action  plan,  including  development  of \ndocuments outlining structural and procedural requirements and establishment of \nIT systems and tools.   \n(iv)  Knowledge  transfer  and  capacity  building  for  asset  and  risk  management, \nincluding development or purchase of IT systems and tools, training, two study \ntours, and one dissemination seminar. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total TA cost is estimated at $2.22 million equivalent, including $1.786 million of \nforeign exchange cost, and $434,000 equivalent of local currency cost. Given the priority that \nNBK attaches to the TA and given the substantive size of the TA, NBK has agreed to finance \n64% of the TA cost in the total amount of $1.42 million equivalent, comprising $1.041 million of \nforeign exchange cost and $379,000 equivalent of local currency cost. NBK will finance the \ndomestic consultants, equipment purchased in line with domestic procurement guidelines, and \n ", "    5 \nprovide office support and workshop facilities. ADB will provide the remaining 36% of the TA \ncost in the total amount of $800,000 equivalent to finance $745,000 of the foreign exchange \ncost and $55,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will require 18.0 person-months of international consulting services and 58 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  international  consultants  will  be  (i)  a \nfinancial governance expert with risk-management background for 4.0 person-months, (ii) an \nasset  management  specialist  for  3.0  person-months,  (iii)  a  monetary  policy  specialist  for \n4.5 person-months, (iv) a securities market expert for 1.5 person months, (v) an econometrician \nand model builder for 3.0 person-months, and (vi) a survey specialist for 2.0 person-months. \nThe domestic consultants will be (i) a financial sector specialist for 10 person-months, (ii) an \neconometrician for 12 person-months, (iii) a survey specialist for 12 person-months, and iv) two \nIT experts for a total of 24 person-months. The international consultants will organize and \nparticipate in three study tours aimed at supporting know-how transfer in financial governance \nand inflation targeting. The domestic consultants are expected to report to the international \nconsultants and to the departments of NBK that they are supposed to support. The outline terms \nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  In view of the specific nature of the TA and the cost-sharing agreement all international \nconsultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  All  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  NBK  in  line  with  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. The monetary policy specialist will be the team leader for the \nfirst  component.7  The  financial  governance  expert  will  be  the  team  leader  for  the  second \ncomponent.8 The team leaders will coordinate the inputs of their component\u2019s consultants and \nconsolidate their reports. Inception reports will be presented within 3 weeks after services start. \nThe teams will also provide two interim reports for each component. Draft final reports shall be \nprovided to ADB and NBK 2 weeks before the end of the TA, and be finalized upon receipt of \ncomments from NBK and ADB.  \n \n18.  NBK will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the TA. NBK will provide the \nconsultants with the necessary office support, including computers and Internet access. Close \ncooperation between ADB and NBK in administration and implementation will ensure strong \ncountry ownership for the TA. For this purpose, NBK will appoint a focal point at a higher \nmanagement level of NBK for each component of the TA, with whom all matters affecting the TA \nwill be closely coordinated, including recruitment of consultants and purchase of equipment. The \nTA will commence in December 2004, and is expected to be completed in November 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.
