The Palau Public Utilities Corporation Reform Program aims to strengthen state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) in Palau by improving the corporate governance and financial management \nof Palau\u2019s electricity and water utility company, the Palau Public Utilities Corporation (PPUC), and \nproviding an enabling environment for private sector participation in Palau\u2019s electricity and water \nsubsectors. The programmatic approach will comprise two subprograms, which will (i) coordinate \nthe sequencing of reforms with the International Monetary Fund and other partners, and (ii) ensure \nsupport for long-term reforms in electricity and water and sanitation. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n2.  Macroeconomic context. Palau consists of 340 islands with a population of about 18,400 \nalmost 80% of whom live in Koror and Airai states. Development grants under Palau\u2019s Compact \nof Free Association with the United States, expected to expire in fiscal year (FY) 2024, contributed \nsubstantially to a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of $15,068 in FY2019. Palau depends \ncritically on tourism and services revenues, which contribute to almost 55% of annual GDP and \nemploy three-quarters of the country\u2019s formal workforce. Prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) disease, Palau had maintained annual fiscal surplus averaging the equivalent of 3.0% of GDP \nduring FY2011\u2013FY2019, extending an impressive period of solid fiscal management that has \nresulted in annual surpluses since FY2011. This was facilitated by tax and revenue reforms that \nresulted in tax-to-GDP ratio increase to an average of 20.2% in FY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.3% in \nthe preceding decade. Similarly, on the expenditure side, Palau has successfully controlled the \npublic sector wage bill, which has declined in proportion to GDP to an average of 14.7% during \nFY2015\u2013FY2019 from 17.1% in the decade prior. Public debt, estimated at the equivalent of about \n32.5% of GDP in FY2019, was considered sustainable.1  \n \n3.  Coronavirus disease impact. With no tourists\u2019 arrivals expected for at least 2 years, \nPalau\u2019s economy is projected to contract by 9.5% in 2020 and 12.8% in 2021,2 compared with \noriginally expected growth of 2.0% and 2.6% respectively.3 Estimates suggest that total tax \nrevenue will decrease by $11 million in FY2020 (4% of GDP) and $19 million in FY2021 (7% of \nGDP). With the drastic decline in revenues and increased health and social expenditures, fiscal \ndeficits of $31.2 million (12.2% of GDP) in FY2020 and $53.4 million (23.8% of GDP) in FY2021 \nare projected. The public debt-to-GDP ratio will rise from 32.5% in FY2019 to 66.9% in FY2020 \nto help meet the estimated financing gap. Furthermore, the decline in tourism will result in \nincreasing unemployment and poverty, particularly among women who were mostly employed in \nthe tourism and hospitality sector. A sound macro-fiscal policy framework is seen to facilitate a \nsteady reduction in the fiscal deficit and debt burden after COVID-19. An independent assessment \nshows that if tourism and economic recovery can commence in FY2022, Palau can revert to \nrunning a small but steadily rising fiscal surplus by FY2024, resulting in a gradual decline in the \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio to about 46.5% by FY2030.4 This is supported by the IMF\u2019s latest assessment \n \n1  IMF. 2020.

Achieving sustainable economic growth is complex and context specific in the Pacific \ndeveloping member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the provision of \nmarket-augmented public goods such as electricity, water, and sanitation is a key determinant of \nthe quality of life for communities and, hence, the attractiveness of a country to private investment. \nWith  COVID-19  and  no  tourism  revenues, Palau  experiences  a  reduced  demand  for  utility \nservices (electricity, water, and sewage) and lower revenues to sustain its public infrastructure.  \n \n5.  Sector context: water supply and sanitation. Palau has established, through ADB \nassistance, the legal and regulatory frameworks for water and wastewater operations (WWO) on \ncommercial principles and at full cost recovery.5 About 96% of Palau\u2019s population has access to \npublic water supply systems. The Koror-Airai water supply system services more than 80% of the \npopulation. The water supply systems outside of Koror-and Airai Palau are in poor condition and \nthe service delivery standards are low. Frequent water outages have a significant impact on \nwomen\u2019s time poverty. Palau has a sanitation policy and a sewerage master plan for Koror \nthrough  2035.  Priority  investments  identified  in  the  Koror  sewerage  masterplan  are  being \ndelivered under the ADB-financed Koror-Airai Sanitation Project.6  \n \n6.  Energy sector. Since 2010, the government has implemented a number of significant \nreforms in the energy sector, including (i) signing into law the Palau Energy Act and creating \nregulatory framework; (ii) setting a renewable energy target of 45% by 20257; and (iii) approving \nenergy efficiency benchmarks and tariff methodology. However, Palau remains highly dependent \non  fossil fuel  (diesel) that contributes  to  95%  of  energy  generation  (compared  with  5%  of \nrenewable  energy  generation)  which  resulted  in  high  cost  of  electricity  production. \nPower generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  reliability  and  efficiency  are  below  Pacific \nbenchmarks and undermined by aged assets and no maintenance and replacement.8 Unreliable \npower has a disproportionate impact on women who are largely responsible for household tasks \nand contributes to  women\u2019s  time  poverty.  Establishing  a  reliable  and an  efficient  grid  with \nfinancially sustainable network management will attract private sector investment in renewable \nenergy and improve power sector performance.  \n \n7.  Palau Public Utilities Corporation. Established in 1994, PPUC is a government-owned \nutility for the generation, transmission, and distribution of power and became also responsible for \nthe provision of public WWO in 2013.9 Women are underrepresented in PPUC and there has \nbeen no institutional gender mainstreaming or proactive actions to increase women\u2019s employment \nto date. The Palau Energy Administration (PEA), acting as the energy regulator, determines the \nPPUC\u2019s tariffs based on a cost-recovery methodology. In FY2016, the PPUC almost achieved its \ntarget of full cost recovery for energy and WWO, as total revenue had risen to over 90% of total \n \n5  ADB. 2010.

In 2017, the Olbiil Era Kelulau froze tariffs for electricity and WWO because \nof perceived political concerns about service costs and quality. Subsequently, PPUC has incurred \nsignificant losses and has insufficient revenue to cover its basic operation without government \nsupport.  \n \n8.  Deteriorating financial performance of the Palau Public Utilities Corporation. As the \nlargest SOE in Palau, PPUC\u2019s negative performance is a key burden on Palau\u2019s economy \nimposing high risk to both fiscal and financial sustainability. Since 2014, PPUC is the only SOE \nthat failed to operate commercially and incurred significant losses, amounting to $21.9 million or \n8% of GDP.10 With operating losses of $6.87 million (2.6% of GDP)11 and its largest cash deficit \n(20% of revenues) in FY2019, PPUC maintained its liquidity by deferral of all maintenance works. \nDelayed metering and power grid upgrade have resulted in high network losses up to 16%. \nCoupled with inadequate financial management (poor accounting system, delayed reporting, and \naudit), it puts PPUC in a negative spiral of limited investments and poor efficiency, making losses \na recurring cause of circular debt.  \n \n9.  Reliance on government support and widening fiscal risk. Over 85% of Palau\u2019s public \ndebt is  owned  by SOEs,  and  PPUC is  a single  largest  borrower  with  outstanding  debt  of \n$21.9 million (32% of total SOEs debt or 8% of GDP). With negative liquidity, PPUC requires \ncontinuous government support to remain solvent. PPUC is also heavily dependent on annual \nsubsidies for operations and maintenance and for the replacement of capital assets. Since 2013, \nPPUC has received over $20 million (7.5% of GDP) of state subsidies, including operational \nsubsidies  of  $14.65  million  and  an  equity  injection  of  $5.5  million. 12  Without  reforms, \nthe government will need to increase its subsidies to PPUC by at least 80% (equivalent to a further \n8% of GDP) over the next 5 years. \n \n10.  Poor  corporate  governance  and  transparency.  Initiated  since  2015,  SOE \ncorporatization  is  incomplete  with mixed  results  in  adopting  and  operationalizing corporate \ngovernance  and  transparency  norms.  The  government\u2019s  SOE  oversight  mechanism  and \ntransparency framework are not yet established, which inhibits timely disclosure of corporate \nstatements by SOE boards and reduces performance quality and accountability. The SOE boards, \nincluding the PPUC board, are mostly focused on basic legal compliance and are rarely held \naccountable for performance. Continuous reliance on subsidies has led to heavy public sector \ninfluence on PPUC governance and the quality of disclosure. Lacking corporate board practices, \ngender diversity and independent decision-making, PPUC failed to develop a high-performance \nculture in setting revenue and operational targets which has resulted in poor creditworthiness. \n \n11.  Lack  of  private  investment  in  renewable  energy,  and  water  and  wastewater \noperations. PPUC is heavily dependent on public funds with no access to private capital available \nfor energy or WWO. With fuel expense making up more than 65% of the generation costs, \nrenewable energy is key to reducing energy costs. The government prioritizes transition to \nrenewable energy by introducing long-term concessions for independent power producers (IPPs). \nWhile power purchase agreements are instrumental for hedging IPPs\u2019 operational risks, PPUC\u2019s \nunderperformance and negative liquidity is a key country\u2019s risk in attracting IPPs. It is estimated \nthat the government\u2019s contingent liability associated with power purchase agreements to keep the \nPPUC solvent costs about 1% of GDP annually.13 Furthermore, Palau\u2019s grid has not been \n \n10  PPUC Audited Statements FYs 2014-18 \n11  PPUC Audited Statements FY2019 Draft. \n12  From PPUC Financial statements 2013-18. 2019-20 figures from Congressional Appropriation bills 2019 and 2020. \n13  IMF. 2018.

ADB\u2019s previous engagement and lessons learnt. Lessons from ADB operations in \nPalau suggest that (i) it is critical to allocate sufficient technical assistance (TA) resources to \nsupport reform implementation given shortages and/or high turnover of qualified staff, and (ii) the \nreform programs require more comprehensive (tariff and nontariff) dialogue with government \nstakeholders to ensure that agreed policy reforms can be implemented in a changing political \nenvironment.14  Previous  policy-based  operations  in  the  Pacific  also  show  that  (i)  strong \ngovernment  ownership  is  critical  to  achieving  results;  (ii)  sustained  policy  dialogue  and \ncoordination with development partners are important to advance reforms; and (iii) coordinated \nTA projects, provided in parallel with budget support programs, are crucial to implement the \nreform agenda. 15,16 The program also draws upon the lessons and recommendations confirmed \nby  a  recently  concluded  SOEs  Reform  and  Engagement  Evaluation,  including  supporting \ngovernment  oversight  mechanisms  for  SOEs,  SOEs\u2019  board  issues,  accountability,  and \ngovernance risks.17 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n  \n13.  The proposed transaction TA (TRTA) attached to the policy-based loan will support the \nimplementation of ongoing and future energy, and water and sanitation reforms. The primary \noutcomes of the transaction TA are (i) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Finance, PPUC, \nand PEA; and (ii) supporting the government to implement proposed policy actions under the \nprogrammatic approach. In particular, the transaction TA will help achieve outputs 2 and 3 of the \nprogram\u2019s design and monitoring framework.18  \n \n14.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  Palau\u2019s  overarching  development  objectives:  (i)  SOEs\u2019 \nsustainability, including full-cost recovery of business and capital, achieved; and (ii) reliability and \nresiliency of energy supply improved based on adequate regulatory framework and tariffs.19 \nAdditionally, the TA supports the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030:20 (i) \naccelerating progress in gender equality, and (ii) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity. It is also consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u22122020, which \nemphasizes the importance of reducing the cost of doing business by lowering the costs of \nconnectivity and energy and creating a more enabling business environment.21 \n \n15.  The results framework, implementation arrangements, cost estimate, and scope of the TA \nin various areas were discussed with the government during the fact-finding mission. \n \n \n14  ADB. 2010.
