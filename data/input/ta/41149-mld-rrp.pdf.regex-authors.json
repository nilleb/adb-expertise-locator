The  plan \n  encourages strategies that are market-based and actively promote \n  competition,  innovation,  and  the  development  of  PPPs.  To  foster \n  greater  private  sector  participation,  the  plan  envisages  the \n  government and the private sector working as partners to (i) provide \n  opportunities  for  MSMEs  to  participate  in  a  more  competitive \n  environment; and (ii) to maximize the potential of PPP, with a view to \n  increasing private investment. \n   \n  In  alignment  with  the  NDP,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  Maldives  prioritizes \n  support  for  PSD.  It  follows  the  ADB  Operations  Evaluation \n  Department\u2019s validation report of the country strategy and program \n  completion report as well as Special Evaluation Study on Private \n  Sector Development and Operations. ADB will thus primarily focus on \n  developing  an  enabling  environment  for  MSMEs  and  help  build \n  capacity for the introduction of PPPs in line with the PSD strategy \n  and  in  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \n  Department.  \n   \n  The  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  MSME  development \n  conducted a survey to identify factors impeding private sector activity. \n   Major obstacles include (i) high cost and limited access to finance, (ii) ", "ii   \nasymmetries  of  market  information  and  business-related  expertise \namong MSMEs, (iii) lack of infrastructure including poorly developed \ninter-island transportation and high cost of power generation, and (iv) \nlack of skilled labor. These factors are to be addressed under the \nPSDP.  \n \nMoreover, even though the Maldives is one of the fastest growing \neconomies  in  South  Asia,  the  benefits  of  growth  have  not  been \nequitably distributed among the people. Income disparities between \nhouseholds in Mal\u00e9 and those in remote atolls are large. Economic \nactivity is constrained by the dispersed population residing in various \natolls, leading to inefficiencies and diseconomies of scale. In addition, \nweak  institutional  capacity  and  human  resource  deficiencies  are \nconstraints across the entire spectrum of the development process in \nthe Maldives.  \n \nTo  ameliorate  domestic  regional  inequalities,  the  Government \nidentified  regional  economic  growth  and  diversification  as  key \nobjectives of economic development in both the 6th NDP for 2001\u2013\n2005 and the current 7th NDP for the northern, north central, central, \nsouth central, and southern regions of the Maldives. As part of its \nplan,  the  Government  is  attempting  to  develop  infrastructure  in \noutlying atolls by developing domestic regional centers designed to \nhave  airports,  ports,  and  other  infrastructure  facilities.  This  is \nexpected to foster employment and income generation opportunities \nin the MSME subsector.  \n \nHowever, due to its limited financial capacity and the need to ensure \nefficient services, the Government is pursuing PPPs for infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  intended  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  developed  and  expanded \nMSME  subsector  leading  to  broad-based,  private  sector-led,  and \nsustainable inclusive growth. The intended outcomes are (i) enhanced \naccess to finance by MSMEs by providing Bank of Maldives (BML) \nwith a line of credit facility (LCF) to pilot credit assistance to MSMEs in \ndesignated regions, (ii) enhanced access to markets, technology and \ninformation  and  strengthened  capacity  of  MSMEs  through  the \nestablishment of business development services centers (BDSC) and \na cost-sharing facility (CSF) designed to meet their special needs, and \n(iii) improved support infrastructure through PPPs. \n   \nCost Estimate and  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $7.8  million,  including \nFinancing Plan  contingencies.  ADB  will  finance  $7.5  million  equivalent  to  cover \n96.2%  of  the  cost,  and  the  Government  will  finance  $0.3  million \n(3.8%). The cost breakdown is (i) component A: BDSC and CSF \noperations  and  related  capacity  development  ($1.9  million);  (ii) \ncomponent  B:  LCF  and  related  capacity  development,  credit \ninformation bureau (CIB), and central moveable assets registry ($3.9 \nmillion); and (iii) component C: PPPs ($1.4 million), plus contingency \nand interest charges ($0.6 million).  ", "  iii\nLoan Amount and  A loan in special drawing rights, equivalent to $7.5million, will be \nTerms  provided from ADB\u2018s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a \nfixed term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The \ninterest rate charge will be 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 August 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  28 February 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting and  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the Executing \nImplementing  Agency. The implementing agencies (IAs) will be (i) the Ministry of \nAgencies  Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) for component A (MSME \npromotion);  (ii)  BML  for  component  B,  subcomponent  1  (LCF  and \ncapacity  development);  (iii)  Maldives  Monetary  Authority  (MMA)  for \ncomponent  B,  subcomponent  2  (CIB  and  central  moveable  assets \nregistry); and the PPP cell in MEDT\u2019s Enterprise Development Unit \n(EDU) for component C (PPP). \n   \nProcurement and  Procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nConsulting Services  Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Selection  of \nconsulting firms for consulting services will use the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method.  The  Government  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  the  procurement  plan  and  ADB  will  review  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procedures,  documents,  bid  evaluations,  award \nrecommendations,  and  contract  in  accordance  with  the  agreed \nprocedures. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds will be used for the BDSC operations, office space, \ncounterpart  staff,  communications,  administrative  support,  and \ncontingencies. \n   \nBenefits and  Around 200\u2013300 enterprises in the northern and southern regions are \nBeneficiaries  expected to receive training and technical support on a cost-sharing \nbasis  to  increase  their  business  competitiveness  during  project \nimplementation. Under a pilot project, a credit line will be provided to \nenterprises  in  these  regions,  while  the  development  of  a  CIB,  a \nlegal/regulatory  framework  for  secured  transactions  and  the \nsubsequent  establishment  of  a  moveable  asset  registry,  and  the \nformation of BDSCs and a CSF, are expected to improve market \naccess for MSMEs in the country and increase the engagement of \nlocal financial institutions in supporting the MSME subsector over the \nlong run. The PPP component will assist in developing infrastructure \nand  services  through  private  investment,  thereby  reducing  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial burden and expanding the scope of private \nsector  participation  in  such  activities  in  the  future.  PPP-based \ninfrastructure  projects  will  facilitate  the  operation  of  MSMEs,  and \nenhance the quality of life of residents of the targeted regions. The \n ", "iv   \nPPP component will assist the Government in enlarging the scope of \nPPP by creating an enabling environment for future PPP projects \nacross  sectors  and  building  capacity  within  the  Government  to \nconceptualize PPP projects. The expansion of MSME operations and \nthe  development  of  PPP-based  infrastructure  are  expected  to \ngenerate  employment  opportunities  in  the  Maldives,  especially \namong the youth based in the atolls.  \n   \nRisks and  Risks  are  linked  to  political  factors,  interministerial  coordination, \nSafeguards  capacity constraints, and factors related to PPPs. \n \nPolitical  risks  suggest  that  despite  technical  merits  of  the  reform \ninitiatives  supported  by  the  Project,  the  implementation  of  some \ninitiatives will require strong political resolve. However, the national \ndevelopment focus on PSD and promotion of MSMEs, particularly in \nthe  remote  atolls  and  islands,  is  embedded  and  prioritized  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy and strategy documents, including the 7th NDP \nand Vision 2020. In addition, the Government is strongly committed to \nplay an important role in the Project including MSME development in \nremote atolls.  \n \nThe project activities involve a cross-section of the MSME subsector \nand  various  ministries.  Therefore,  close  coordination  is  required \namong relevant government agencies and with the private sector to \nsupport and oversee project implementation. To mitigate coordination \nrisks, the Project will ensure smooth implementation through the use of \nan interministerial project steering committee and a dedicated project \nmanagement unit working closely with private sector representatives.  \n \nVarious departments and agencies have capacity constraints. Unless \ncapacity is enhanced, effective implementation of the Project will be at \nrisk. To mitigate this, the Project emphasizes developing the capacity \nof financial institutions, business associations, and government IAs to \nsupport successful project implementation.   \n \nFinally, the preparation and development of projects on a PPP basis is \na  complex  process  requiring  strong  government  commitment  and \nsupport as well as public acceptance. The selected projects will need \nto be financially viable. Project selection for development on a PPP \nbasis will be based on the Government\u2019s plans and strategies and be \nappropriately packaged so that they provide strong value for money. \nThe Project is intended to help guide this process. \n ", "  v\n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Maldives  for  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Government Strategy \n \n2.  The Maldives, a small island economy, comprises 20 atolls1 with a total land of less \nthan  300  square  kilometers  (km2)  spread  over  900  km2.  The  country\u2019s  population  of \napproximately 321,000 live on 202 of the 1,190 islands. Only 28 islands have a land area \ngreater than 1 km2. Only 5 islands have a population greater than 5,000 and 70% of the \ninhabited islands have a population of less than 1,000. With a total land area of 2 km2, the \ncapital island of Mal\u00e9 is home to one third of the population. It is the seat of the Government \nand the center of commerce and business. Concentration of the population in the capital is \ngrowing, especially after the December 2004 tsunami that destroyed the means of livelihood \nin many islands. The small domestic market, high degree of openness to trade and investment \nflows, and heavy dependence on tourism and fisheries make the Maldives highly sensitive to \nexternal developments and tourist arrivals. \n \n \n  1.  The Macroeconomic Context \n \n3.  The Maldives has made impressive progress in its socioeconomic development. Sound \nmacroeconomic  management  combined  with  favorable  external  conditions,  and  strong \ndevelopment  assistance  support  led  to  an  average  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth of 7.9% over the past 15 years. The tourism sector is the engine of growth, accounting \nfor 33% of GDP, 28% of domestic revenue, and over 90% of balance of payments service \nreceipts.  Sustained  growth  in  tourism  has  driven  economic  expansion  across  other \ncomplementary sectors in the economy including construction, transport and communications, \nand wholesale and retail trade. Notwithstanding, prudent fiscal and monetary management, \nfiscal situation has significantly deteriorated since tsunami. The economy remains characterized \nby (i) limited scope for sector diversification and overall dependency on tourism, (ii) limited \nresource base (fisheries), and (iii) institutional capacity constraints. A summary of the sector \nand subsector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Despite sound macroeconomic management, income disparities between Mal\u00e9 and the \natolls are large and increasing. The gini coefficient2 for the Maldives for 1997 was 0.42 which \ncompares favorably in the rest of the region. During 1997\u20132004, inequality within Mal\u00e9, within \nthe atolls, and within all domestic regions declined marginally. However, inequality between \nMal\u00e9 and the atolls increased. In 2005, according to all reasonable poverty lines, poverty \nincidence was the highest in the northern and north central regions.3  \n \n \n                                                 \n1   A group of coral reef islands that surround a lagoon and are surrounded by open sea. \n2  The gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion most prominently used to measure inequality of income \ndistribution or inequality of wealth distribution. No other decomposition indexes exist for tracking aspects of \ninequality. \n3  ADB. 2007. Maldives Country Partnership Strategy 2007\u20132011. Manila. ", "2   \n5.  The Government, in an effort to ameliorate regional inequalities and reverse migration \nto the capital, has placed regional economic growth and diversification as a key objective of \neconomic development in both the 6th National Development Plan (NDP) for 2001\u20132005 and \nthe current 7th NDP for 2006\u20132010. As part of the 7th NDP, the Government is developing \nregional centers designed to have airports, ports, and other social and infrastructure facilities,4 \nsuch as health and education for the resident population. They will be complemented by focus \nislands acting as atoll service hubs and growth centers. The success of the growth centers \nalso depends on the connectivity that will make these growth centers accessible to the local \npopulation. Unless a strong network of connectivity is provided between these growth centers \nand population density areas within these atolls, these services will remain unutilized and will \nnot  meet  the  objectives  for  which  they  have  been  planned  and  developed  owing  to \ndiseconomies of scale.5 These efforts will reduce regional differentials and promote inclusive \ngrowth and employment opportunities. \n \n2.  Need to Promote Private Sector Development \n \n6.  The Maldives has one of the most liberal trade, labor, and investment regimes in South \nAsia. However, the Government plays a large role in the economy, indirectly limiting the scope \nfor private sector participation. Government ownership, whether full or partial, is widespread in \nevery sector of the economy except tourism. In 2005, the country\u2019s 21 state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) accounted for 36% of GDP, compared to 8% in member nations of the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development. SOEs employ one third of the workforce, making \nthem the largest group of employers. In addition, civil service employment increased fivefold in \n20 years. The development of the private sector has thus been limited given the lack of a \nsupportive policy environment.  \n \n7.  Changing the Government\u2019s role from a direct provider of services to a facilitator of \nprivate initiatives in the economy is one of the key requirements for improving efficiency and \neffecting  good  governance.  Recognizing  this,  the  Government  has  made  private  sector \ndevelopment (PSD) as one of the key pillars of the 7th National Development Plan (NDP) for \n2006\u20132010.  The  plan  encourages  strategies  that  are  market-based  and  actively  promote \ncompetition, innovation, and the development of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). To foster \ngreater private sector participation, the plan envisages the government and the private sector \nworking as partners to (i) provide opportunities for MSMEs to participate in a more competitive \nenvironment;  (ii)  to  maximize  the  potential  of  PPPs,  with  a  view  to  increasing  private \ninvestment; (iii) improve corporate governance and transparency; and (iv) develop linkages \nwith domestic and international private sectors to share expertise, resources, and technology.  \n \n8.  Apart from traditional areas such as manufacturing and trading, the private sector is \nbecoming increasingly important in areas and sectors traditionally considered to be under the \npublic sector domain. This will include the development of infrastructure as in the planned \nregional centers to be complemented by focus islands acting as atoll growth centers. Given the \nfiscal pressures and its own capacity, the Government would have difficulty in developing the \nrequired infrastructure facilities and providing services in an effective and efficient manner. The \nGovernment is also developing another 44 tourist resorts in addition to about 90 existing ones. \n                                                 \n4  Republic of the Maldives. 2007. The 7th National Development Plan. Mal\u00e8. \n5  Islands  that  are  of  importance  to  the  population  consolidation  program  are  likely  to  have  the  following \ncharacteristics: (i) sufficient land area to support a larger population; (ii) proximity to atoll capital; (iii) substantial \nexisting infrastructure; and (iv) potential for growth because of land area, and agricultural, fishery, or other \ncommercial activity. \n ", "  3 \nThe new resorts will require additional transport linkages, distribution networks, power, water, \nand a host of other commodities and goods. \n \n9.  In  this  context,  the  private  sector  can  play  an  important  role  by  financing  critical \ninfrastructure needs and undertaking the basic services. The greater demand for these services \nfrom the increased number of resorts could lead to economies of scale for the supplier of those \nservices. This in turn would lead to a decrease in the cost of services for the resorts. In \ncombination with greater supply of resort rooms, this could lead to some rationalization of tariffs \nfor  tourists  within  the  resorts,  thereby  increasing  the  country\u2019s  competitiveness  in  the \ninternational tourism market. The greater flow of tourists will feed into the higher demand for \nservices and help foster the growth of private sector enterprises. Fortunately, the Maldives has \ngroups that can initiate and sustain private sector investments, help in broad-based private \ninvestment and initiatives under a PPP format with other regions, services and activities. Within \nthe  private  sector,  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  can  prosper  by \nproviding needed services, and supplying goods in the growth centers and hubs. \n \n3.  Enabling Environment for Private Sector Participation  \n \n10.  Weak Enabling Environment. Limited private sector participation in the Maldives has \nbeen primarily due to the lack of a conducive environment for private sector participation and \ninadequate public sector goods to support private investments. The key enabling factors for \ngreater private sector participation include (i) clear government policy to promote PPP, shifting \nthe Government\u2019s role from a provider of services to a facilitator, consequently undertaking the \nprivatization and restructuring of SOEs; (ii) an effective legal and regulatory environment; (iii) \ngood governance and transparency; (iv) capacity development [with business development \nservices (BDS)]; (v) easy access to finance; (vi) introduction of PPP; and (vii) availability of \nproject finance for private sector projects or PPPs. All these enabling factors have been either \nmissing or are weak in the context of the Maldives.6 \n \n11.  The  recent  update  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  Report  (2007)7 using  the \nindicators of starting a business and dealing with licenses, ranks the Maldives 31st and 8th \nrespectively out of the 178 countries. The indicator on enforcing contracts (court efficiency) \nranks the Maldives 41st, with shorter duration of enforcing contracts of 665 days and less cost \n(percentage of the claim, including court costs, enforcement costs, and attorney fees) 16.5%, \nwhile neighboring countries such as India and Sri Lanka are 1,420 days and 1,318 days for the \nduration, and 39.6% and 22.8% for the cost ratio. With respect to legal enforcement of banks\u2019 \nrequired collateral, fixed mortgage enforcement is very effective. Unlike other countries in South \nAsia, enforcement of bank mortgages (houses and registered vessels) happens within one year. \nThis is mainly due to the Government\u2019s parallel efforts to improve the overall legal framework \nand enabling environment. The indicator for protecting investors and corporate governance \nranks the Maldives 62nd out of 178, similar to India and Sri Lanka. However, the indicator for \ngetting credit ranks the country 132nd, mainly because of strict collateral requirements, difficulty \nin obtaining credit information, and lack of secured financing legal/regulatory and institutional \nframework covering moveables.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Land reform is another factor that will support private sector development (PSD) in the Maldives. However, the \nissues involved at this stage are beyond the scope of the proposed Project (first phase). The World Bank study \n(Sustaining Growth and Improving the Investment Climate) and ADB TA 4745 on SME Development provide an \nassessment of the scope of reforms for private sector development.  \n7  World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2007. Doing Business in 2007. Washington, DC. \n ", "4   \n12.  Mitigating these Weak Factors. The first three enabling factors of paragraph 10 are \nbeing currently addressed by TA interventions of several development agencies including the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the  World  Bank  (Appendix  3).  The \nGovernment is taking a broad range of actions to improve the legal and regulatory framework. \nMoreover,  UNDP  and  other  United  Nations  agencies  continue  to  help  the  Government \nharmonize the legal framework with international standards and increase the capacity of the \njustice system. With respect to the legal and regulatory environment, the enforcement of court \njudgments in the judicial system is improving due to the passage of regulations in 2006 enabling \nthe courts to seize bank accounts and hold the passports of those who fail to honor outstanding \nclaims. Regarding governance and transparency, UNDP and other United Nations\u2019 agencies \npropose to provide assistance to the anticorruption board, public complaints bureau, and audit \noffice. The World Bank continues to manage a European Union-funded activity to develop and \nimplement a public accounting system, as well as Institutional Development Fund grants for \nstrengthening  procurement  capacity.  As  for  SOE  reform,  ADB  has  an  ongoing  project  to \nrestructure and privatize SOEs.8 In terms of business regulation, the Maldives has strong tax \nadministration and few barriers for entry of new businesses.9 Moreover, ADB\u2019s proposed TA \nloan for strengthening the economic and financial management program covers governance \nand transparency issues.10  \n \n13.  Consequently, based on the survey findings under the ADB TA (footnote 6) and in \ncoordination with other donors, the Project, as a first phase of support, intends to address the \nenabling factors for greater private sector participation identified under the remaining items (iv), \n(v), and (vi) of paragraph 10: capacity development (including the provision of BDS), easier \naccess to finance, and development of PPPs. The progress made and lessons identified during \nproject implementation under phase I of the country partnership strategy (CPS) (footnote 3) will \ndetermine the nature of support to address enabling factors available for project finance for the \nprivate sector as well as improvement of the enabling environment for greater private sector \nparticipation during phase II.  \n \n4.  Micro-, Small-, and Medium-Sized Enterprises \n \n14.  Classification. Current data maintained by the Government and the Maldives National \nChamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (MNCCI)  provide  limited  information  on  ownership, \nemployment,  turnover,  and  capital  investment  of  businesses.  About  2,500  businesses  are \nregistered with the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) and about 20% of \nthese reportedly submitted information on their annual turnover. Lack of data has prevented \nbusinesses from being classified, but the 7th NDP calls for the introduction of online business \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006.

Also, SEFMP covers governance and transparency issues.  \n ", "  5 \nregistration procedures in 2008 to facilitate the procedure, broaden the coverage, and help \nclassify businesses.  \n \n15.  Definitions. The Maldives currently classifies MSMEs on the basis of a combination of \nemployees and turnover or sales. This system has the potential to lead to some confusion. To \novercome conflicting definitions and unreliable data on assets, the Maldives could simplify the \ndefinition by following international practice of using only the number of employees to classify \nenterprises. Recent work on MSMEs that include some small island economies provide a \nstandard for classification,11 i.e., microenterprises have up to 4 employees, small enterprises, 5\u2013\n19 employees, and medium-sized enterprises, 20\u201350 employees. \n \n16.  MSME Sectoral Analysis in the Atolls. In the atolls, fisheries and agriculture are the \nmost important activities of MSMEs in the primary sector. Fisheries sector has traditionally \ndominated activity with the processing of fish that take the form of dried, salted, and smoked \ntuna fish products for local consumption and for export to Sri Lanka. Agriculture is the second \nmost important activity and has a large potential for commercialization in Mal\u00e8 and resort \nmarkets.  In  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sector,  wholesale  and  retail  trade,  maintenance  of \ncoastal  vessels  (mainly  for  fishing),  construction,  and  transportation  are  traditional  island \nactivities of MSMEs. In contrast, handicrafts and tourism-related services have been given \nlimited attention, despite their potential. The main business activities in the atolls of the northern \nand southern regions are (i) wholesale and retail trade and other services (60%), (ii) fisheries \n(14%), (iii) manufacturing including fisheries processing (10%), (iv) agriculture (9%), and (v) \nconstruction and others (7%).  \n \n17.  In the northern and southern regions, 39% started their businesses during the last 5 \nyears  and  57%  of  the  businesses  started  during  the  last  10  years.  Only  14%  of  existing \nbusinesses are said to be older than 20 years. Many of the businesses were owner-operated \nwith  the  help  of  family  members.  More  than  90%  of  all  business  employed  less  than  5 \nemployees  and  the  average  number  of  workers  employed  is less  than  2  employees.  The \nbusinesses interviewed were asked to state the value of their business assets. In the atolls, \nmost of the businesses do not maintain records of their assets. The estimated asset value of \n25% of these businesses are less than Rf50,000 (around $3,900), assets of another 25% were \nbetween Rf50,000 and Rf100,000 (around $7,800), and 40% estimated their assets at more \nthan  Rf100,000.  Only  5%  indicated  that  their  assets  were  more  than  Rf1  million  (around \n$78,000). For more details, please see Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n1.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n18.  The Government is aware of the significance of strengthening the MSME subsector as a \nstep towards promoting overall inclusive growth. However, despite Government efforts, the \nMSME  subsector  continues  to  be  weak,  it  has  not  generated  much-needed  employment \nopportunities to serve as the engine of growth as planned. Based on the findings of ADB TA on \nMSME development,12 the issues and opportunities for the sector are as follows. \n \n                                                 \n11  Small and Medium Size Enterprises in Countries in Transition. 2006. Entrepreneurship and SMEs Series. Geneva. \nFor a survey of MSME definitions used in transition economies, see United National Economic Commission for \nEurope.   \n12 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. \nManila (TA 4745-MLD). The TA includes an MSME market survey. \n ", "6   \n19.  The ADB TA on Small and Medium Enterprises development (footnote 6) conducted a \nsurvey of 228 businesses in the northern, southern, and south central regions. Major constraints \nidentified include limited access and high cost of financing, limited market access, lack of \ntechnically skilled labor, and high cost of transportation and power. The relative significance and \nseverity  of  other  constraints  affecting  enterprise  performance  are  highly  diversified  across \nsectors. Access to and cost of finance nevertheless emerged as the major obstacle to doing \nbusinesses in major sectors. \n \na.  Limited Access to Financial Services \n \n20.  Limited  Access  to  Finance.  Only  one  third  of  MSMEs  use  bank  loans  for  their \nactivities. Instead, firms rely on internal funds for working capital. Bank of Maldives (BML), the \nlargest and a national commercial bank, contributes 11% to existing working capital needs of \nMSMEs while 3% come from other international commercial bank branches.13 Nearly 60% of the \ncredit extended is for tourism, followed by export\u2013import related services covering commerce \nand fisheries. Together, these three sectors absorb more than 85% of existing loans.  \n \n21.  Lack of Credit Information on MSMEs and Secured Financing. As mentioned earlier, \nthe Maldives ranks 132nd worldwide on the comparative ease of getting credit, below most other \nSouth Asian countries. The poor ranking is largely due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable credit \ninformation on credit borrowers especially MSMEs due to the absence of a public or private \ncredit information database and a central information agency to facilitate the exchange of credit \ninformation among lenders. Consequently, the provision of financial services is restricted to low-\nrisk clients or based on excessive collateral requirements instead of a credit analysis relying on \nfinancial statements and business plans. Therefore, development of a credit information system \nto improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of credit risk decisions by financial institutions \nwould result in improved access to finance. Moreover, in the current lending environment, there \nis  no  scope  to  borrow  against  moveables  (e.g.,  receivables,  inventories,  chattels  on \nmachineries, motor vehicles, etc.) due to the lack of an enabling law and regulatory framework \nto allow such lendings and a central registry for verifying the existence and status of such \ncollaterals. Given that MSMEs usually have significant moveable assets, enabling borrowers to \nuse these moveable assets and rights to secure their indebtedness open up new possibilities for \nMSMEs to access finance and make more efficient use of their assets.  \n \n22.  Collateral-based Lending. General banking practices limit loan amounts for businesses \nin the atolls to 50% of the assessed value of houses and registered vessels. This provides a \ngood  opportunity  to  introduce  a  new  financing  culture  that  can  overcome  existing  lending \nrestrictions to enhance working capital and term finance and encourage investment without \nunduly increasing commercial lending risks. The plan to set up a pilot line of credit facility (LCF) \nis expected to engender more loans being sanctioned for MSME risks. The LCF is expected to \nenable BML to familiarize itself with MSMEs and to be able to offer loans with less restrictive \ncollateral  requirements  than  conventional  arrangements.  The  improved  understanding  of \ndealing with MSME risks, based on cash flow and financial and operating performance and the \nintegrity of the borrower, should lead to improved recovery rates of loans granted under the \nplanned LCF, which is in turn expected to lead to a reduction in the risk averseness of the \nfinancial institutions toward noncollateral cash-based lending. \n \n                                                 \n13 BML is jointly owned by the Government (51%), island communities (25%), and other government agencies (24%). \nBML has 19 branches, including 5 mobile branches. \n ", "  7 \n23.  Underdeveloped Banking Subsector. The financial sector is limited in size with one \nlocally owned bank (BML), branches of three South Asian commercial banks, and a Hongkong \nand Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) international bank branch. All these banks follow \ninternational  banking  practices.  Banking  is  regulated  by  the  Maldives  Monetary  Authority \n(MMA), which acts as the central bank. Banks seldom extend loans with maturities of more than \n3\u20135 years and the spreads remain high. Under the Project, the suggested subloans are to have \nlonger maturity periods, more than 3 years, and a spread based on prevailing market rates of \n4%\u20135%.14 These will be reviewed by ADB TA consultants during the initial stage of project \nimplementation to determine if the spreads are commensurate to the risk in a setting where \nthere is limited market competition. \n \nb.  Business Support Infrastructure \n \n24.  Lack  of  Market  Information  and  Technical  Expertise. Other key impediments to \nMSME growth are the lack of market information and limited technical expertise. Most MSMEs \nare still in their early stage of development, selling their products locally or, at best, to the \nmarket in Mal\u00e9. MSMEs have difficulty obtaining relevant business information on markets and \ntechnologies, and employing external services to enhance their business performance.  \n \n25.  Limited Role of Business Member Organizations and Need for Capacity Building \nwithin  the  Government.  Business  member  organizations,  such  as  the  Maldives  National \nChamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) and Women Entrepreneurs Council (WEC), are \npresent in Mal\u00e9. However, their range of activities and services are limited. On the other hand, \nthe  Enterprise  Development  Unit  (EDU)  under  MEDT,  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to create a competitive private sector, currently operates with seven newly \nrecruited staff who need training in facilitating market development and promoting MSMEs. \n \nc.  Private Sector Participation through Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n26.  Infrastructure Deficiency. High utility prices in remote atolls reflect lack of infrastructure \nfor transportation and power. Cargo transportation relies on traditional cargo and passenger \nvessels operating on an unscheduled basis. Passenger transport relies on the same vessels \nand the use of air transport services. This has led to the high cost of doing business in the \natolls. The real issue is fragmentation of demand and consequent higher costs to the economy \nas a whole as the services were created individually leading to higher per unit costs and lower \ncapacity utilization. Therefore, the Government has an opportunity to undertake the role of \nregulating some of these sectors to meet conventional objectives and to structure projects to \nallow the private sector to consolidate demand and achieve its financial and commercial targets. \n \n27.  Enabling Environment for PPP. Consequently, the Government intends to promote the \ndevelopment of infrastructure, particularly for remedying the current regional imbalance and low \nlevel of competitiveness of domestic MSMEs. The development, execution, and management of \nPPP projects, however, is a complex process, requiring detailed upfront planning throughout the \nlife of a project and anticipating risks and issues that are likely to impact project success. \nTherefore, the existing legal, institutional, and regulatory environment needs to be reviewed to \nidentify areas that could be improved to create an enabling environment for private sector \nparticipation  before  the  selected  PPP  projects  are  offered  under  the  pilot.  The  enabling \nenvironment may differ from sector to sector and would provide policy stability and credibility \n                                                 \n14 According to BML, spread on the LCF could be reduced due to the partial government guarantee. \n ", "8   \nthat would go a long way to attracting private investments in infrastructure sectors in the long \nterm. \n \n28.  Capacity Development. Along with streamlining and creating an enabling environment \nfor private investors, appropriate capacity development must be carried out within the key \ngovernment  ministries  that  would  be  developing  and  handling  such projects.  The  capacity \ndevelopment would involve (i) institutionalization, within the government, of PPP procurement \nprocess and skills development, and development of an effective sector strategy and project \nidentification  and  prioritization  process;  (ii)  improved  preparation  of  projects  to  meet  more \ndemanding requirements of investors; and (iii) widespread understanding, through education \nand application, of the different private sector participation options that could be effective.15 \n    \n2.  Strategy and Lessons \n \n29.  The  Government\u2019s  Development  Strategy  and  ADB\u2019s  Country  Partnership \nStrategy.  PSD  is  a  key  pillar  of  the  7th  NDP  (2006\u20132010).  As  earlier  stated,  the  plan \nencourages  market-based  strategies  and  actively  promotes  competition,  innovation,  and \nresilient PPPs (Appendix 4). ADB\u2019s CPS 2007\u20132011 for the Maldives is fully aligned with the \ngoals and objectives of the 7th NDP and those of the development partners to promote PSD for \nbroad-based  economic  growth.  ADB  assistance  is  to  be  provided  following  a  sequential \napproach to enhance a holistic set of capacity building for PSD that includes (i) improving the \nenabling  environment  for  MSMEs,  (ii)  enhancing  access  to  finance  and  easing  financial \nconstraints, and (iii) introducing PPP in identified areas such as transport and power. The CPS \nidentifies key indicators including business model development linked to the markets, with \nenhanced access to financing and improved PPP development. Once readiness is secured, \nADB\u2019s targeted second phase of assistance would include support for investment projects to \nleverage institutional strengthening measures already in place.  \n \n30.  Findings  of  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department.  The  project  design  uses \nimportant  recommendations  in  the  validation  report  of  the  country  strategy  and  program \ncompletion report16 prepared by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department. The dearth of a \ncritical mass of suitably trained staff has undermined institutional development and business \ndevelopment activities in the Maldives. Under its analysis, the report identifies the following \nweaknesses  (i)  lack  of  adequate  human  resources,  (ii)  institutional  deficit,  and  (iii)  low \nabsorptive  capacity  for  external  assistance.  Moreover,  the  recent  evaluation  study  of  the \nOperations Evaluation Department on PSD operations emphasizes the importance of PPPs in \ndeveloping the private sector. ADB will help build the Government\u2019s capacity to facilitate MSME \ndevelopment and PPPs under phase I of the CPS, which is to fill the skills gap between the \nprivate sector in the Maldives and other comparable middle-income developing countries.    \n \n31.  Lessons from PSD Operations. The project design considers lessons from ADB and \nother  development  partners\u2019  projects  in  the  Maldives.  Key  lessons  are  (i)  implementation \ncapacity constraints hamper funding agencies\u2019 ability to contribute to development results in a \ntimely manner and could be used far more effectively if institutional capacity constraints were \nholistically addressed and enhanced; (ii) PSD operations must be closely coordinated with other \nexternal  funding  agencies  especially  where  effective  partnerships  and  synergies  can  be \n                                                 \n15 For more details, please refer to paragraphs 54-58. \n16 ADB. 2007. Validation of the Country Strategy and Program Completion Report for the Republic of the Maldives. \nManila.  \n ", "  9 \nforged;17 (iii) the Government needs to play a key role as facilitator for PSD, while direct service \nprovision should be left to the private sector;18 and (iv) the Government needs to ensure that \nremote islands are able to participate in the growth process and thus more emphasis needs to \nbe given to improving connectivity and ensuring reliable sources of electricity are provided on a \nsustainable basis in the atolls.  \n \n32.  With respect to business development and access to financing issues, an assessment of \nthe projects19 implemented by the International Fund for Agricultural Development and UNDP \nreveal the following lessons (i) keeping the credit and noncredit activities under the same \numbrella of the development banking cell of BML led to neglect of noncredit activities, therefore \nthe strategy under the Project is to keep noncredit activities under the separate umbrella of \nbusiness development services centers (BDSC) operations; (ii) about one third of the borrowers \nutilized the loan for consumption expenditure and immediate liquidity needs instead of investing \nit in income-generating activities because of the sole focus of BML credit officers on loan \nrecovery and not on monitoring the activities of borrowers; the Project strategy is therefore to \nkeep the monitoring and guidance provision under the purview of BDSC operations; (iii) BML did \nnot adequately focus on implementing training and advisory assistance for the target groups \nand did not use the risk fund established for such activities. Instead, the development banking \ncell reserved the fund to cover any non-repayment of loans by beneficiaries; the Project strategy \nis therefore to provide for a CSF to support training and advisory activities under the BDSC \noperations with stricter approval mechanisms; (iv) the loan recovery rate was very high at 98% \nowing  to  incentives  built  into  the  lending  mechanism,  i.e.,  a  facility  providing  higher  loan \napprovals for borrowers who repaid the loan on schedule; the Project strategy is to have a credit \ninformation bureau (CIB) providing credit ratings for borrowers in the medium term for easy \naccess to finance; and (v) poor households were not effectively targeted under previous projects \nand have not been able to access finance due to lack of effective training; the Project strategy is \ntherefore to use the BDSC operations to undertake such training and mobilization. \n \n3.  External Assistance  \n \n33.  Several externally assisted activities relate to the creation of an improved environment \nfor business development. The Government has embarked on a new strategy of engaging with \nits development partners to focus on providing assistance in certain sectors or thematic areas to \nreduce  duplication  and  overlap,  and  to  minimize  aid  transaction  costs.  ADB  will  focus  on \ncapacity building in public sector management as well as support for transport, power, and \nMSMEs. The World Bank will remain engaged in governance, tertiary education, fisheries, and \nenvironmental  management.  The  United  Nations  will  remain  involved  in  governance  and \ndisaster management. ADB\u2019s total lending assistance to the Maldives between 1995 and 2006, \non an approval basis, totaled $57.6 million for nine projects.20  \n                                                 \n17 A project needs to develop close linkages with other projects to avoid costly overlapping and to be sustainable. \n18 Successful transition to middle income country status requires changing the role of government from a provider of \nbasic services to a regulatory setting role, establishing equal opportunities for the private sector, and establishing a \nframework for formulating and implementing policies including attracting more foreign investments. \n19 The Atolls Credit and Development Banking Project and Southern Atolls Development Project funded by the \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  as  well  as  the  Atoll  Development  Project  for  Sustainable \nLivelihoods project funded by UNDP. \n20 Two loans for a total of $15.0 million were provided to the energy sector, two loans for $12.3 million to the \neducation sector, one loan for $9.5 million to the communications sector, and two loans for $14.0 million for \nregional outer islands development. Besides the planned assistance, ADB provided a grant of $20.0 million and a \nloan of $1.8 million for emergency post-tsunami assistance in early 2005. \n ", "10   \n34.  Five  United  Nations  organizations  maintain  offices  in  the  Maldives.21 World  Bank \ninvolvement  has  been  somewhat  limited.  Since  1979,  it  has  financed  and  completed  eight \nprojects with total loans amounting to approximately $66.2 million.22 Currently, it is funding a \nproject on mobile phone banking aiming to provide an automated banking and payment system \nthrough mobile phones, leading to reduced transaction cost. Details of external assistance to the \nsector are given in Appendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n35.  The  intended  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  developed  and  expanded  private  MSME \nsubsector  leading  to  accelerated  inclusive  growth  for  broadbased  and  sustainable  local \neconomic development in the northern and southern domestic regions and targeted sectors in \nthe Maldives. It is also aimed at providing the necessary support infrastructure to improve the \ncompetitiveness of domestic MSMEs and redress the current regional imbalance through the \npromotion of PPPs. \n \n36.  The outcomes of the Project will include (i) enhanced access to finance by providing an \nLCF to pilot credit assistance to MSMEs in designated regions, capacity development of BML, \nestablishment of a CIB, and introduction of a legal/regulatory framework and a central moveable \nassets  registry  for  secured  financing;  (ii)  improved  access  to  markets,  technology  and \ninformation, and strengthened capacity development by creating BDSC operations and a CSF \nto ensure provision of the necessary TA and knowledge transfer for growth-oriented MSME \nbusinesses;  and  (iii)  institutionalization  of  PPP  as  a  means  for  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation in the development of critical infrastructure necessary for MSME and overall PSD. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Component A: MSME Promotion  \n \n37.  The component will focus on establishing BDSC operations and a CSF to facilitate \ndemand-oriented private sector BDS and assist the MSMEs, both existing and start-ups, and \ndevelop the capacity of related stakeholders. To effectively support development of the MSME \nsector,  the  Government  needs  to  pursue  a  well-coordinated  approach  in  consultation  with \nprivate sector stakeholders. Since the availability of capacity development training institutes is \nconstrained, the Government will need to expand the responsibilities of EDU to bring together \ndifferent  types  of  PSD  including  MSME  development  under  a  strengthened  institutional \nframework. \n \na.  BDSC Operation \n \n38.  The BDSC operations will be the principal vehicle for the delivery of BDS products to \nMSMEs for facilitating cluster development in targeted regions. There is currently no BDS \n                                                 \n21 Namely, United Nations Children's Fund, UNDP, United Nations Population Fund, United Nations Volunteers, and \nWorld Health Organization. Their activities are coordinated under the United Nations development framework. \nUNDP\u2019s work concentrates on governance, poverty reduction, and environment as well as MSME support. \nCurrently, a project is under way on public service reforms aiming at capacity development in the public sector. \n22 Four educational projects contributed to human resource development; upgrading of the airport in Mal\u00e9 supported the \ngrowth of tourism. Three projects helped modernize the fishing fleet and strengthen public sector capacity in \ncollecting, processing, and exporting fish. \n ", "  11 \nprovider in the Maldives. Owing to the easier availability of resources in Mal\u00e9 as well as the fact \nthat most MSME entrepreneurs do visit Mal\u00e9 for various reasons, a central BDSC will be set up \nin Mal\u00e9 within EDU. The project management unit (PMU) within the EDU will be the overall \ncoordinating body for the BDSCs. The project coordinator of the PMU will be recruited on an \ninternational contract (for 24 person-months). The project coordinator will be supported by one \nnational  MSME  portal  and  communication  specialist,  and  one  national  monitoring  and \nevaluation specialist. \n \n39.  The central BDSC will provide services in the targeted regions through two operation \ndesks  to  be  housed  in  the  existing  regional  development  management  office  premises  at \nHithadhoo (southern region) and Kulhudhuffushi (northern region). The operation desks will be \nstaffed by general administrative staff drawn from existing staff of the regional development \nmanagement office. The specialized staff and resources will travel to the local BDSCs on a \nneeds basis to provide specialized services and training. This will help avoid idle resources and \noptimize utilization of BDSC resources. One national consultant will be based in each of the \nBDSC operation desks. Initially, the TA will be provided to the BDSC operations to support \ndevelopment of a business plan indicating core activities and required investment, identification \nof revenue streams, and recruitment of staff and their capacity building.  \n \nb.  Cost-Sharing Facility Operation \n \n40.  Coverage. A $1.0 million CSF is proposed to conduct capacity development in a wide \nrange of services to about 200\u2013300 MSMEs for local economic development in the targeted \nregions and sectors.23 The range of services will include (i) consulting services for business \nplanning and business counseling, identification and provision of information, and coaching; (ii) \ntraining services on costing and pricing, marketing and sales, accounting and entrepreneurship; \n(iii)  facilitation  services  for  market  access,  access  to  finance,  and  formation  of  business \ncooperatives; and (iv) government-related services covering support for business registration \nand licensing, linking to the government database and extension services. The Project will \nsupport development of service products that could be marketed to provide a revenue stream to \nmake the unit self-sustaining in the future beyond the CSF time frame. The ratios for cost-\nsharing among the CSF and beneficiaries as well as detailed administrative procedures will be \nfinalized by the project management unit and CSF management unit.24 ADB reserves the right \nto perform random audit of the CSF management unit to ensure adequate and efficient use of \nfunds. \n \n41.  CSF Management. The BDSC will act as the CSF management unit with the provision \nof a subcommittee for initial screening and provision of recommendations to the project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  for  its  final  approval  of  the  cost-sharing  mechanism.  The  BDSC  will  be \naccountable to the PSC. The project coordinator, an international consultant, will chair the \nsubcommittee, which will comprise one representative to be nominated from each of EDU, \nMNCCI, and WEC. The decisions of the subcommittee will be by a majority vote. \n \n42.  Monitoring  and  Supervision.  Each  BDSC  operation  desk  will  submit  an  annual \nprogress report to the project coordinator on the supported enterprises. The cost of monitoring \nand evaluation field visits will be covered by fees charged by the central BDSC with any deficits \n                                                 \n23 This coverage was calculated from population figures in the vicinity (over 30,000 inhabitants) and the estimated \nnumber of microenterprises in the target atolls. \n24 ADB. 2005.

These administrative procedures, etc. will be finalized \nbased on the recommendations of this TA.  \n ", "12   \ncovered by the CSF upon prior approval of the CSF management unit. An overall evaluation of \nthe CSF will take place at the middle and end of project implementation. Details of the CSF are \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \nc.  Capacity Development of EDU, MNCCI, and WEC \n \n43.  EDU is one of the main pillars of the Government\u2019s efforts to create effective and \ncompetitive PSD. Established in 2004, EDU currently operates with newly recruited staff in need \nof experience relating to MSME promotion. Capacity development support will be provided to \nEDU  through  the  project  coordinator,  a  communications  specialist,  and  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation specialist for the duration of the project. Training programs will be conducted for \nregular EDU staff in project coordination, marketing, financing, and communication skills. The \nProject will support EDU in the design and implementation of a media campaign, development \nand registry of a web portal for EDU, policy development through competitive studies of various \nproducts and services to prioritize specific industries and sectors, and strategic support for \nrelevant cluster and supply chain analyses in targeted regions.    \n \n44.  MNCCI and WEC will be involved in supporting BDSC operation by providing linkages \nwith available markets and providing consulting services. MNCCI and WEC will be represented \non  the  CSF  subcommittee  so  that  they  are  involved  in  the  decision-making  process  for \nsupporting entrepreneurship. MNCCI has about 460 members, of which 60%\u201380% are MSMEs. \nIt provides a range of services in advocacy, lobbying, government liaison, and organization of \ntrade fairs. Its effectiveness is undermined by the lack of regional chapters in the atolls, a lack of \nstrategy and plan of activities, and the absence of any BDS products for its members. MNCCI \nrecently attempted a business link project through MEDT to provide BDS to the MSMEs. The \nefforts of MNCCI are constrained by lack of clear-cut strategy, lack of professional staff, and \nlack of funding for staff training. To address these constraints, the Project will support MNCCI in \ndeveloping its strategic planning process including elaboration of plans for operations, human \nresource development, and training for recruited professional staff.  \n \n45.  WEC currently does not have a secretariat and shares MNCCI facilities. It has been \ninvolved in the \u2018WEC for Women Empowerment Program\u2019 supported by the United Nations \nPopulation Fund and the gender ministry. This program entails training women to produce \nhandicrafts. WEC sources the produce from the women, undertakes quality control, and certifies \nand markets the products. WEC has been undertaking a program in association with UNDP \nwhereby UNDP is providing handicraft training and WEC is providing training to those women in \nentrepreneurial skills. WEC needs a secretariat with suitably qualified staff to undertake quality \ncontrol, inventory management, marketing, and website maintenance. The Project will support \nWEC\u2019s capacity development to undertake such activities efficiently and provide extension \nservices to the BDSC operations. \n \n2.  Component B: Enhancing Access to Finance  \n \n46.  Banking practice in the Maldives limits loan amounts for businesses in the atolls to 50% \nof the assessed value of houses and registered vessels. Commercial banks do not accept other \nmoveable assets due to monitoring difficulties. A facility is needed to enhance access to finance \nfor MSMEs without unduly increasing commercial lending risks. To help overcome the financing \nconstraints, the Project will provide a credit line for providing finance to the MSMEs and develop \n ", "  13 \nsupporting  credit  infrastructure  to  facilitate  credit  decision-making  and  making  collateral \nrequirements less restrictive.25 These are essential to improve market-based finance to MSMEs. \n \na.  Subcomponent 1: LCF Operation and Capacity Development  \n \n47.  BML is the main financial institution in the Maldives lending to MSMEs, and this lending \nhas  been  limited  and  has  very  high  collateral  requirements.  The  Government  is  keenly \ninterested in promoting the MSME subsector but access to finance, especially for medium- to \nlong-term  funds,  has  emerged  as  the  greatest  bottleneck  for  MSME  development. \nConsequently,  the  Government  through  MEDT  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury \n(MOFT) decided to embark on this initiative involving BML as the implementing agency (IA) for \nthe LCF to pilot expanded credit assistance to MSMEs under a partial government guarantee to \nprovide BML an avenue to better understand MSME risks, strengthen its ability to mitigate risks, \nand  appreciate  the  revenues  and  benefits  of  engaging  in  the  development  of  the  MSME \nsubsector. The aim is to have BML subsequently pioneer support for the subsector owing to an \nimproved understanding and familiarity from this pilot operation. Credit enhancement operations \nfor the MSME subsector have proven effective in a number of schemes and countries. Other \ncomponents revolve around this component as the CSF and CIB will be useful only if MSMEs \nhave enhanced access to finance.  \n \n48.  Credit  Line  for  MSME  Lending.  An  LCF  is  envisaged  under  the  Project  to  pilot \ninitiative 26  in  promoting  a  culture  of  lending  to  MSMEs  with  less  restrictive  collateral \nrequirements and cash-flow-based financing. The aim of the LCF will be to build the capacity of \nBML in undertaking development-oriented financing. The Republic of the Maldives will borrow \nfrom ADB and bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan. MOFT will enter into a subsidiary loan \nagreement  with  BML,  and  the  LCF  will  be  provided  to  BML.  BML  has  experience  with \ndevelopment banking and an adequate number of professional staff to administer the LCF. The \nproposed LCF fund size will be $3.0 million during the pilot phase. Applications for subloans will \nbe  prepared  at  the  BDSCs  based  on  the  business  plans  submitted  by  the  MSMEs  and \nforwarded by the BDSC to BML for credit risk assessment. The BDSC will provide credit risk \ninformation related to the applicant for BML\u2019s consideration. BML will undertake an independent \ncredit risk assessment of the proposals to determine whether they meet lending criteria agreed \nto by BML, the Government, and ADB. Upon completion of scrutiny, BML will decide whether to \napprove the subloan. Onlending agreements will be signed between BML and the subborrower. \nThe terms of such agreements will be on a commercial basis at the prevailing market rates of \ninterest and tenor. BML will execute an onlending agreement with the subborrower, and submit \na report on approved subloans and a copy of onlending agreements to MOFT. The maximum \nsubloan  size  for  applicants  will  be  $80,000  (or  Rf1,024,000)  and  the  anticipated  average \nsubloan size is $40,000. It is expected that BML will provide around 70 MSMEs with subloans \nunder LCF.27 Any deviation will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval.  \n \n49.  EDU, in cooperation with MNCCI, WEC, the BDSCs and BML, will act as the facilitator \nfor marketing and popularizing the facility. This is necessary, in the context of the Maldives, as \ncapacity must be developed within an institution to introduce credit guarantee products. The \n                                                 \n25 According to the conventional arrangements in Maldives, the borrowers are requested to provide collaterals up to \n200% of the assessed value of houses and registered vessels. Under the LCF, the collateral requirement will be \nless restrictive and the collateral ratio will be reduced down to 100% (or less) of the assessed value.  \n26  Upon successful implementation of pilot initiatives, building on this component, a separate non-sovereign loan to \nBML could be considered for enhancing the access to finance for MSME throughout the country. \n27 Based on the survey under ADB TA 4745 on Small and Medium Enterprise Development (2007), ADB identified \nadequate size for subloans. Please see Supplementary B (MSME Survey of Summary of three Regions) for details. \n ", "14   \nBDSCs\u2019 involvement in appraising the loan assistance proposals under the LCF is expected to \nact as counter-check for any moral hazard. To provide BML with an incentive for onlending to \nMSMEs  in  designated  atolls  with  less  restrictive  collateral  arrangement,  which  is  the  core \npurpose in line with the purpose of loan under the LCF, the Government will provide BML with \nan 80% guarantee for defaulting subloans. BML will bear the remaining risk to ensure BML \ncontinues to be diligent in its lending activities. Details of the LCF are in Appendix 6. \n \n50.  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Development  Support  to  BML.  The \nproposed LCF will leverage on the strong branch network and wide geographic presence of \nBML and support BML in its efforts to extend its business outreach to MSMEs located in the \ntargeted regions. As accreditation of lending based on agreed eligibility criteria will be delegated \nto BML, the financial aspects of BML\u2019s performance have been reviewed.28 Details of the BML \ndue diligence are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. To enable BML to fully exploit its \npotential and effectively intermediate financing, BML must strengthen its existing structure, \noperations, and capacity for MSME lending. Capacity development will be provided to cover \nBML\u2019s  human  resource  strategy  and  training,  performance  targets,  and  enhancement  of \nefficiency to reach out to target clients in designated regions. Adequate risk assessment and \neasy loan procedures are as important for MSMEs as low interest rates. Therefore, during the \npreparatory  period  for  loan  implementation,  the  introduction  of  appropriate  MSME  lending \nproducts and techniques, risk assessment, loan operating procedures, and strengthening of \ninstitutional capacity of BML will be essential.29 The Project will review the legal aspects of \nenforcing debt recoveries and contract enforcement in the event of defaults on subloans.  \n \nb.  Subcomponent 2: CIB and CMAR \n \n51.  This subcomponent will support the establishment and implementation of a CIB. The \nInternational Finance Corporation recently provided support to MMA to develop a feasibility \nstudy, including identification and drafting of the necessary regulatory framework, costing, and \npreparation  of  technical  specifications  for  appropriate  hardware  and  software.  The  study \nconcludes that market support will be positive and information asymmetry in the market must be \nreduced. ADB and International Finance Corporation are currently assisting MMA in preparing a \nrequest for proposal for a turnkey consultancy package for establishment and implementation of \nthe  CIB.30 The  CIB  will  develop  a  database  for  MSMEs  to  support  financing  by  financial \ninstitutions for the subsector.   \n \n52.  This subcomponent will also support the MMA in laying the foundations for secured \ntransactions,  the  drafting  of  the  underlying  legal/regulatory  framework  and  subsequent  \n                                                 \n28 The development banking cell in BML has extended need-based credit to island populations. These have helped \nthem to attain income security, own productive assets, and develop their entrepreneurship skills. BML, through its \ndevelopment banking activities, was the implementing agency of the Atolls Credit and Development Banking \nProject, which covers the northern and central atolls, and the Southern Atolls Development Project, which covers \nthe four southern atolls. Both projects were financed by long-term borrowing from the International Fund for \nAgricultural Development. \n29  For this purpose, the ongoing ADB TA-4745 MLD will provide necessary assistance for BML to ensure that it \nefficiently  intermediates  financing  and  fully  utilizes  the  funds  through  establishment  of  adequate  financing \nmechanisms. \n30 The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), established under the MMA Act of 1981, has been empowered by section \n4, subsection (c) to supervise and regulate banking so as to promote a sound financial system. Best practice \nprinciples regarding use of credit information have been introduced in the Banking Act and MMA Act. As such, \nthere are no major legal barriers to information sharing under the Project. Moreover, in order to expand the scope \nof use of credit information from banking sector to nonbanking sector, the Government is reinforcing the necessary \nlegal framework.  \n ", "  15 \nintroduction of a central moveable assets registry (CMAR) in the medium term,31 a master plan \nensuring  integration  between  CIB  and  CMAR,  and  procurement  plans  including  technical \nspecifications for appropriate hardware and software equipment. MMA is considering a two-\nphased approach. The first phase under the Project will create a preliminary database listing all \nexisting  collateralized  properties  recorded  with  the  financial  institutions  and  will  involve \npreparation of an action plan for establishment of CMAR including recommendations for the \nlegal or regulatory framework, and equipment needed to integrate all the registration information \nof CMAR with CIB. The second phase32 will subsequently implement the action plan, arrange \nlinks and networks, and make the CMAR operational. The procurement plan is attached in \nAppendix 7. \n \n3.  Component C: Capacity Building for PPP  \n \n53.  The Project envisages supporting the Government with two aspects of developing PPP \ninfrastructure projects. The first part of the Project will assist the Government through a PPP \ncapacity building consultancy in assessing the existing enabling and regulatory environment for \nPPP and suggesting measures and reforms required to create a favorable and transparent \nenvironment for developing infrastructure projects through PPP. The Project will also focus on \ndeveloping capacity within the Government to formulate sectoral PPP strategies and projects, \nand manage PPP procurement processes. A PPP cell will be set up within EDU and the \nGovernment will depute additional staff to the PPP cell as the current staff of EDU cannot take \non additional responsibilities. An effective knowledge-sharing arrangement will be put in place \nbetween MOFT and EDU regarding all past and future initiatives and materials related to PPP. \nThe Project will provide capacity development for the PPP cell as the key IA for the successful \nimplementation of component C.33 Building on this, the second task is to identify and structure \ntwo infrastructure projects using the PPP model on a pilot basis.34 Its target will be to assist the \nGovernment in bidding out two pilot projects on a PPP basis. The time gap between developing \nthe  enabling  environment  and  actual  implementation  of  PPP  pilot  projects  is  reflected  in \nAppendix 8 and Supplementary Appendix E. \n \na.  PPP Enabling Framework and Capacity Development (Task 1) \n \n54.  This task involves developing the enabling frameworks for PPP and developing the \ncapacity of key government ministries to institutionalize the development and management \nprocess for PPPs. The Project will support the following three aspects.  \n \n55.  Policy and Regulatory Framework. Based on the preliminary analysis of issues in key \nPPP sectors identified, the Project will review the policy for these sectors and develop improved \npolicies  for  supporting  PPP  projects.  It  will  help  draft  regulations  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment for PPPs, including legal, fiscal, tax, foreign investment frameworks, and other \nincentives.  \n \n                                                 \n31  This is subject to MMA acceptance of the concept as per the findings of the feasibility study.  \n32 Based on the Project\u2019s outputs, the proposed ADB project loan, to be processed in 2009\u20132010, could include a \ncomponent to establish a basis for introducing a CMAR to be integrated with the CIB. The establishment of the CIB \nand CMAR will run in parallel, however, these two activities will be independent of each other.   \n33  The Public Enterprises Monitoring and Evaluation Board at MOFT is one of the most important pillars for enhancing \nPPP in the Maldives. It will work closely with the PPP cell at EDU to address any coordination issues between \nrelevant ministries and SOEs already undertaking activities envisaged to be developed through PPPs. \n34  Through PPP consultants, the Project will assist the Government in identifying two projects that have the potential \nto be developed on a PPP basis; carrying out demand/technical assessment, project structuring, financial analysis, \nand PPP structuring; and developing model bidding documents and development frameworks. \n ", "16   \n56.  Institutional  Framework  and  Capacity  Development.  The  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment in formulating institutional strategies to study current Government functions and \ncapacities;  and  identify  support  required  to  encourage  and  manage  PPP  in  the  identified \nsectors. It will help develop the capacity of identified staff to equip them with a range of skills \ncovering technical, financial, and legal aspects needed for effective management and handling \nof PPP projects. \n \n57.  PPP Financing Framework. The Project will help develop two funding mechanisms, a \nproject development fund and a project preparation fund. Given the fragmented demand, PPP \nprojects may not be financially viable at the outset and, as a result, could have long gestation \nperiods. In such a scenario, a dedicated funding mechanism that supports projects especially \nduring  their  early  period  of  development  could  take  the  form  of  a  project  support  fund. \nSimultaneously,  a  project  preparation  fund,  funded  initially  by  the  Government,  should  be \ndeveloped to fund project preparation activities leading to successful selection of a private \ndeveloper. The project preparation fund will be in the nature of a revolving fund, wherein once a \nproject is successfully bid out, the related project preparation costs, such as feasibility studies in \nproject design, land acquisition, etc., would be recovered from the successful bidder so that \nfurther new project development activities can be undertaken without the government having to \nincur additional project preparatory costs. \n \nb.  Conceptualizing and Structuring Two Projects on PPP (Task 2) \n \n58.  The second task under the PPP component is to assist in structuring and developing two \nidentified pilot projects on a PPP basis\u2014for example, one in domestic maritime transport and \nlogistics,35 and another in the power subsector.36 The Project will help detail the concept and \nstructures of the projects and carry out financial feasibility studies. The Project will help identify \nvarious PPP models that can be applied and choose the most appropriate model. For chosen \nprojects, partnership frameworks will be developed based on the Government\u2019s objectives and \npriorities for inviting private sector participation.  \n \n59.  The Project will support the development of the partnership framework identifying key \nissues and risks in proposed projects and mitigation measures. These will include terms of the \nconcession,  financing,  revenue  risk  and  guarantees,  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the \nGovernment and private sector, scope of transaction, form and level of government support, \nand other similar aspects impacting the value proposition for the private and public sectors. \nBased  on  the  partnership  framework,  appropriate  project  and  legal  documentation  will  be \nprepared  to  form  the  basis  for  the  transaction  and  partnership.  The  frameworks  will  be \ndiscussed within the Government and accepted before the selection process can be designed \nand run to select a PPP developer. \n                                                 \n35 The domestic maritime transport project aims to provide regular and reliable ferry transport services within atolls \nand between key growth centers across key atolls; and to involve and combine freight and resort transportation \nelements to bring economies of scale, reduce transport costs, and provide much needed regular access to \npopulations and businesses to various services and facilities being developed at these growth centers. Additionally, \nsuch projects can be combined with rights to the development of local transportation and logistics supply chain \ninvolving warehousing, cold storages, harbors, and other distribution networks. This will benefit local economies \nand generate demand for the private sector. \n36 In line with the draft energy policy, power projects, including projects relating to renewable energy sources such as \nthose based on solar, wind, or hybrid systems, are expected to be conceptualized and developed by the private \nsector through innovative packaging allowing economies of scale and savings. The Maldives Electricity Committee \nis a government agency that regulates tariffs of electricity provided in the islands. The State Electricity Company \nLimited (STELCO) is a leading SOE in providing electricity to 20 major islands including Mal\u00e9. Currently, ADB TA \n(SOE privatization and restructuring) is assisting the restructuring and privatization of STELCO. \n ", "  17 \nC.  Project Investment Plan \n \n60.  The project investment cost is estimated at $7.8 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of around $47,000. The Government will finance local taxes and duties. The project \ninvestment plan is provided in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 9. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Project Costs \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.

Among these, the price contingencies were calculated pursuant \nto domestic cost escalation in the Maldives (4% annually).  \nd Includes interest, commitment charges, and front-end fees.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n61.  The Government has requested a loan in special drawing rights equivalent to $7.5 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-\nyear term including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and other terms and conditions set out in the loan \nagreement.  The  ADB  financing  will  cover  96.2%  of  the  project  costs,  primarily  for  the \ninternational consultancy, turnkey consultancy package for CIB, and establishment of a CSF \nand LCF. The Government will finance $0.3 million equivalent (3.8% of the project cost) as in-\nkind support primarily for counterpart staff, communications, workshops, and administration \nsupport. The financing plan is provided in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  7.5  96.2 \nGovernmenta  0.3  3.8 \n  Total  7.8  100.0 \na  Includes  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  communication,  administration  support, \ncontingencies. The source of the Government funding is from a budget allocation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n62.  Relending. Under a subsidiary loan agreement with BML, the Government will relend \n$3.0 million equivalent in local currency to BML to develop an LCF on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. The terms and conditions of relending will need to reflect the costs of \nraising such funds locally and avoid discouraging domestic resource mobilization. Under a \n ", "18   \nsubsidiary loan agreement with MMA,37 the Government will relend $720,000 equivalent to \nMMA for the setting up of the CIB, drafting of the legal regulatory plan and framework and \nexecution for the central assets registry on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. The \nGovernment has indicated that the terms of the loans to BML and MMA will not exceed 24 \nyears, including a 3-year grace period. These loans will be disbursed over 3 years, subject to a \nmidterm review after 18 months to review disbursement progress and refine the arrangements \nas needed.  \n \n63.  Onlending. The maximum subloan size for individual applicants will be Rf1,024,000 \n($80,000). Individual subloans exceeding that amount will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval. \nThe terms and conditions of onlending will be on a commercial basis at the prevailing market \nrates of interest and tenor, reflecting costs of raising such funds locally and guaranteeing \nadequate spread of interest rates for BML to cover transaction costs and risks.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Key Project Management Entities \n \n64.  MOFT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  Project  and \ncoordinating the activities of all IAs. MOFT will liaise with ADB on all project administration \nmatters in general. The IAs will be (i) MEDT for component A; (ii) BML for component B, \nsubcomponent 1; (iii) MMA for component B, subcomponent 2; and (iv) a PPP cell within \nMEDT\u2019s EDU for component C. Each IA will be responsibility for the day-to-day implementation \nof project components within their respective mandates. A PMU will be established in the EDU \nand will be headed by a project director. The project director will be responsible for coordinating \nthe project activities, overseeing logistical arrangements, and performing other assignments \nnecessary for project implementation. The PMU will also comprise a project coordinator who will \nreport to the project director. \n \n2.  Project Steering Committee  \n \n65.  A  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MEDT  deputy  minister  and  comprise  the  executive \ndirectors from MOFT, MEDT, Ministry of Atolls Development, and Ministry of Planning and \nNational Development; a senior executive director of MMA; an assistant general manager of \nBML; the project director; and executive directors from other ministries and agencies, on a need \nbasis.  One  representative  each  from  MNCCI  and  WEC  will  attend  the  PSC  meetings  as \nobservers. All members will have an alternative member in case the member is otherwise \nengaged. The PSC will include a member from each ministry related to sectors identified for \nPPPs. The project coordinator under EDU will serve as the PSC secretary. The PSC will meet \nat least once every quarter to discuss the agenda finalized by the secretary and circulated to the \nmembers in advance of the meeting. The IAs will prepare annual work plans and budgets to be \npresented  to  the  PSC  for  its  endorsement.  Moreover,  the  reports  generated  through  the \nparticipatory planning, monitoring, and evaluation system will be presented to the PSC on a \nbiannual basis. The project management organization structure is given in Appendix 10. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n37 The subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) and MMA has been made in \nline with government policy and arrangement mechanisms in the Maldives. \n ", "  19 \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n66.  The Project will be implemented within 2.5 years. It will be completed by 28 February \n2011. The overall project implementation schedule is summarized in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n \n67.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  subject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). For procurement of goods and \nservices  to  be  financed  by  subloans,  subborrowers  will  follow  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. To be acceptable to ADB, such procurement procedures will be (i) in \naccordance with established private sector or commercial practices, (ii) appropriate under the \ncircumstances, and (iii) comply with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date). Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Selection  and  engagement  of \nconsulting  services  will  use  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  80:20  ratio,  for \nconsulting firms (Appendix 7). The turnkey consultancy packages for CIB under component B, \nsubcomponent 2, are attached in Appendix 7.38 The Project will finance 79 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 124 person-months of national consulting services. The \nterms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  attached  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  The \nGovernment will be responsible for the procurement plan, and ADB will carry out reviews of the \nGovernment\u2019s procedures, documents, bid evaluations, award recommendations, and contract \nin accordance with the agreed procedures.   \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n68.  Immediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  MOFT  will  establish  two  imprest  accounts  to \nexpedite project implementation through timely release of ADB funds for eligible expenditures. \nThe first imprest account will finance all activities under component A, subcomponent 2 of \ncomponent B, and component C. It will be established within MMA in the name of MOFT. The \nsecond imprest account will finance all activities under subcomponent 1 of component B and will \nbe open within MMA in the name of MOFT.39 The initial advance to the first imprest account in \nMOFT  will  be  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or \n$380,000, whichever is lower. The second imprest account in MMA will be given an initial \nadvance  of  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  project  implementation  or \n$300,000, whichever is lower. The currency of these imprest accounts will be the dollar. Except \nas ADB may otherwise agree, BML will establish a second-generation imprest account within \nBML for the LCF to be financed through the second imprest account. The currency of the \nsecond-generation imprest account will be the rufiyaa. The initial amount to be deposited into \nthe second-generation imprest account will not exceed the lower of the estimated expenditure \nfor the first 6 months of project implementation, or the equivalent of $300,000. \n \n69.  MOFT will be responsible for managing and administering the imprest accounts. The \nproject loan will be disbursed using the statement of expenditure procedure to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB statement of expenditures procedure will \nbe used to reimburse or liquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for individual payments not \n                                                 \n38  ADB is jointly working with the International Finance Corporation for the establishment and implementation of the \nCIB.

BML  will  be  responsible  for  managing  a  second-generation  imprest \naccount; it will be subject to the subsidiary loan agreement in place between BML and the \nGovernment.  The  disbursement  procedures  relating  to  LCF  under  subcomponent  1  of \ncomponent B should be in accordance with the development finance institution loan procedure \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nthe detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and ADB. With respect to the \nfree limit, the maximum loan size for individual applicants permitted under the loan agreement \nwill be $80,000 (or Rf1,024,000). \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n70.  The  PMU  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  imprest  accounts  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and will have these accounts and records audited \nannually  in  accordance  with  standards  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts,  including \nstatement of expenditures, will be provided to ADB within 6 months at the end of the fiscal year. \nThe annual audit will provide an opinion on the soundness of the imprest accounts and the use \nof the statement of expenditures procedure. ADB retains the right to (i) audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts including those of the IAs, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification \nissued by the Government for each withdrawal application. The PMU will submit quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB concerning the use of project loan proceeds, project administration, \nand financial management.40 \n \n71.  The consultants recruited under the Project will prepare (i) an inception report within 4 \nweeks  of  service  commencement;  (ii)  midterm  reports  (including  quarterly  reports)  at \nappropriate stages of the Project; (iii) a draft final report 4 weeks before completing the contract; \nand (iv) a final report after incorporating comments from ADB, MOFT, and the IAs. A tripartite \nmeeting of the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be carried out prior to finalizing each \nundertaking and terminating each contract. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n72.  The  PMU,  drawing  on  data  from  the  IAs,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \nperformance management system that will generate annual reports every 6 months. The system \nwill be established, as agreed between the Government and ADB, to ensure that the Project is \nmanaged efficiently, benefits are maximized, and social impacts are monitored. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n73.  The Government and ADB will review project implementation at least three times a year. \nADB  will  field  regular  review  missions,  including  midterm  and  project  completion  review \nmissions to coincide whenever possible with the program reviews and tripartite meetings. A \ncomprehensive midterm review at approximately 18 months from the date of loan effectiveness \nwill be undertaken to evaluate progress, and MOFT and the IAs will participate in the midterm \nreview.  These  reviews  will  include  an  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and progress with the project agenda. \n \n                                                 \n40 The reports will include (i) 6 monthly and annual project implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and \n(iii) a project completion report to be submitted no later than 6 months after project completion. The reports and \nconsolidating inputs from the implementing agencies will cover (i) expenditures, (ii) activities financed, (iii) a \nsummary of audit issues, and (iv) progress of project components. \n ", "  21 \n9.  Governance and Corruption Risks \n \n74.  Governance and corruption risks in the Project can be categorized broadly as policy- \nand legislation-related, capability-related, and project management-related. First, these include \nweak policy on the privatization policy and PPPs, and potential delays in developing the legal \nframework to set up a CIB and for a basis of introducing secured transactions. Second, risks \ninclude  capacity  constraints  in  MOFT  and  the  IAs,  and  lack  of  sustainability  of  capacity \ndevelopment efforts in the Project. Third, risks include political interference in access to credit \nthrough the LCF, complex MOFT and IA arrangements, misuse in the LCF, lack of engagement \nof participants, lack of full adherence or very rigorous criteria for credit eligibility, transaction \ncosts in excess of perceived benefits, and inability of project beneficiaries to meet expectations. \nSeveral mitigating measures have been proposed such as (i) capacity development support, (ii) \nthe Government commitment through assurances in the Project, (iii) proper design of the terms \nof references of consultants and monitoring of their performances, and (iv) encouraging private \nsector associations to participate in the Project. Appendix 11 provides a risk analysis, and \nsuggests appropriate risk mitigation measures. \n \n75.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA, IAs, PMU, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nProject  will  introduce  additional  specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and  prevent \ncorruption.  Such  measures  include  (i)  continued  consultant  support  to  PMU  staff  on \nprocurement and project management; and (ii) random and independent spot checks by ADB \nreview missions on procurement and financial project accounts. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n \n76.  The Project is expected to contribute to (i) an improved business environment for PSD \nwith enhanced institutional capacity and financial services outreach; (ii) improved access to \ncredit  by  MSMEs  through  better  use  of  credit  information;  and  (iii)  increased  BDS  for \nenterprises to access training, consulting, marketing, and information. As a whole, the private \nsector will benefit from the Project\u2019s holistic approach to ensuring an enabling environment for \ndoing business, better access to financing, enhanced business support infrastructure, and \nincreased market access and product competitiveness for inclusive growth, as well as creating \nnew employment opportunities for people residing in the atolls especially the youth. About \n200\u2013300 MSMEs in targeted regions are expected to receive training and technical support on \na  cost-sharing  basis  to  increase  product  competitiveness  during  project  implementation. \nUnder a pilot project, around 70 subloans will be provided to MSMEs in these regions. The \nProject is unlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impact. Subprojects to be \nfunded from the LCF fund are unlikely to have significant adverse environmental impacts. \nSubprojects will be required to comply with applicable government environmental regulations \nand  standards.  Moreover,  PPPs  will  expedite  enhanced  private  sector  participation  and \nbusiness expansion by MSMEs and bidding of two PPP subprojects, which will help increase \n ", "22   \nemployment, facilitate MSMEs to access the market, and enhance quality of life of residents in \nthe targeted regions. The summary initial poverty and social sector analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Risk Analysis \n \n77.  Risks  are  linked  to  (i)  political  factors,  (ii)  interministerial  coordination  factors,  (iii) \ncapacity  constraint  factors,  and  (iv)  PPP-related  factors.  First,  political  risks  suggest  that, \ndespite technical merits across reform initiatives supported under the Project, some initiatives \nwill require strong political resolve to implement. Second, the project activities involve a cross-\nsection of the MSME sector and various ministries. Therefore, close coordination is required \namong  relevant  government  agencies  and  with  the  private  sector,  principally  through  the \nbusiness  associations  of  commerce  and  industry,  to  support  and  oversee  project \nimplementation. Third, various departments and agencies have capacity constraints. Unless \ncapacity  is  enhanced,  effective  implementation  of  the  reforms  will  be  at  risk.  And  fourth, \npreparation and development of projects on a PPP basis is a complex process requiring the \nGovernment\u2019s strong commitment and support as well as public acceptance. The Government \nwill  be  assisted  by  consultants  to  develop  PPP  models  and  to  select  projects  which  are \nfinancially viable.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n78.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will set up a PSC chaired \nby the deputy minister of economic development and trade and composed of the \nexecutive directors of MOFT, MEDT, Ministry of Atolls Development, Ministry of \nPlanning and National Development, a senior executive director of MMA, an \nassistant general manager of BML, project director, and executive directors from \nother ministries and agencies, as appropriate. The PSC will be responsible for \nthe monitoring, evaluation, and coordination of the project activities. The PSC will \nmeet every quarter, or as often as needed. The Government will ensure that (a) \nADB is entitled to receive all reports and minutes of the PSC upon request and \nmay attend meetings of the PSC as an observer; and (b) IAs prepare annual \nwork plans and budgets to be presented to the PSC for its endorsement. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that within 3 months of loan effectiveness, EDU \nestablishes  (a)  the  central  BDSC,  to  facilitate  coordination  between  different \nministries and other government agencies involved; and (b) the BDSC operation \ndesks in Hithadhoo and Kulhudhuffushi. The Government will ensure that central \nBDSC and BDSC operation desks are made operational within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that throughout the implementation period of the \nProject, adequate budgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds are \nmade available, approved, and released in a timely manner.  \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that adequate  office  and  other  facilities  for  the \nProject  are  made  available  and  ensure  that  all  such  facilities  are  properly \nmaintained during the project implementation period. \n ", "  23 \n(v)  The Government will ensure that each of the IAs is adequately staffed and \nprovided, in a timely manner, with the necessary financial, technical, and other \nresources, including equipment, to perform their functions under the Project. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  subloan  proposals  under  the  LCF  are \nselected in accordance with the following criteria: \n(a)  the number of employees of the MSME is up to 50; \n(b)  the MSME is registered in the EDU MSME database;  \n(c)  the  MSME\u2019s  activities  are  focused  on  target  clusters  (agricultural \ncommercialization,  fishery  processing,  tourism-related  activities,  and \nhandcrafts);  \n(d)  the MSME\u2019s operations are based on two focus regions (northern and \nsouthern);  \n(e)  MSMEs with 20 or less employees will have an enterprise budget and \nthose with more than 20 employees will have adequate cash flow and \ncollateral based on independent default risk assessment criteria agreed to \nby the Borrower, BML, and ADB; and \n(f)  the  proposal  is  in  compliance  with  the  Government\u2019s  applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that EDU, in cooperation with MNCCI and WEC, \nconducts information dissemination on BDSC and LCF on a regular basis. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the CSF is made operational on a pilot basis \nwithin 6 months of loan effectiveness. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that BML establishes an LCF desk within 2 months \nof  loan  effectiveness  to  make  LCF  operational  within  6  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n(x)  The Government will ensure that within 3 months of loan effectiveness, BML will \nfinalize a detailed operation mechanism for the LCF. \n(xi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  LCF-funded  subprojects  comply  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s applicable environmental laws and regulations. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that MMA completes installation of the CIB within 10 \nmonths of the award of contract for CIB hardware and software, except as may \nbe otherwise agreed between MMA and ADB. \n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nnotification on the establishment of the PPP cell in EDU is issued by MEDT and \nan adequate number of staff is recruited or seconded to the PPP cell. \n(xiv)  The Government, MOFT, IAs, and PMU will comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date). Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  allegedly  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \nMOFT, IAs, PMU, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n79.  The PMU will have been established in EDU, MEDT, and its project director will have \nbeen appointed. \n \n \n ", "24   \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n80.

Small Island Economy \n \n1.  Special Challenges. The Maldives, a small island economy, comprises 20 natural \natolls with a total land mass of less than 300 square kilometers (km2) spread over 900 km2. \nThe  Maldives  has  a  number  of  economic  disadvantages  similar  to  other  small  island \neconomies that undermine the country\u2019s international competitiveness. In small economies \nlike the Maldives, the percentage deviation of costs from a medium-sized economy are more \nthan 70% for sea freight, nearly 50% for electricity and telephone service, and more than 30% \nfor unskilled labor and fuel. In sectors like tourism1, these high costs translate into a 60% \noverall  increase  in  the  cost  of  tourism,  which  can  be  passed  onto  the  high-end  tourism \nconsumer,  but  are  not  readily  transferable  to  products  like  handicrafts,  agro-industrial \nproducts, and manufactured goods that compete in fairly homogeneous international product \nmarkets. From a policy perspective, this does not suggest the need for protection against the \nrest of the world, but rather proactive policies that seek to overcome or partially compensate \nfor the economic disadvantages associated with the high production and trading costs.  \n \n2.  Economic Growth. Despite its intrinsic competitive disadvantages, the Maldives is \none of the fastest growing economies in South Asia. Two sectors, tourism and fisheries, have \nbeen  the  driving  forces  behind  the  expansion  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  and \nemployment generation, and have created linkages to other subsectors like local handicrafts, \nand tourism. In 2006, the sharp rise in real GDP reflected a resumption of growth following the \ndevastation  that  occurred  throughout  the  country  as  a  result  of  the  2004  tsunami.  The \nrecovery has been largely driven by tourism and brings the country back to its steady-state \ngrowth path of around 6% a year.2  \n \n3.  Regional Growth Inequalities. The benefits of the country\u2019s high economic growth \nrates in the past 10 years have not been equitably distributed to the population. Average \nhousehold income in the atolls is 55% of that in Mal\u00e9.3 Decentralization of economic activity \nhas been undermined by lack of infrastructure, a poorly developed interisland transportation \nsystem,  financial  system  constraints  to  credit  for  businesses,  and  legal  and  regulatory \nbarriers. Greater opportunities for people living in Mal\u00e9 have produced a fourfold population \nexpansion in the past 20 years, and Mal\u00e9 now has a population density that is among the \nhighest in the world, a situation made all the more severe by the recent tsunami. \n \nB.  Major Constraints \n \n4.  Several areas of the Maldives regulatory environment rank fairly high in affecting the \nease of doing business, but the country\u2019s comparative position recently declined because of \nincreased burdens in several areas that especially impact micro-, small- and medium-sized \nenterprises (MSMEs). Downgrading has occurred in (i) ease of employing workers, (ii) starting a \nbusiness, (iii) protection of investors, (iv) contract enforcement, (v) trading across borders, and \n(vi)  ease  of  closing  a  business.  In  other  business  regulatory  environments,  the  country\u2019s \ncomparative ranking has not changed from a year earlier, that is, no comparative improvement \nin the business regulatory environment has been made. \n                                                 \n1  In addition to 1,190 inhabited islands, 87 islands are designated and developed as tourist resorts, with an \nadditional 11 islands currently being set aside for development. \n2  For more details, see Supplementary Appendix A (Sector and Subsector Analysis).  \n3  Ministry of Planning, Republic of the Maldives. 2004. 2002\u20132003 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. \nMale. ", "Appendix 2  31 \n5.  Internal Constraints. The ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance that \nsurveyed business conditions and perceptions by MSMEs in three key regions of the Maldives.4 \nThe principal concerns of enterprises in the northern and southern regions include lack of \ntechnically skilled labor and management, accounting skills, and market information. Availability \nof skilled labor is the only major problem for enterprises in the northern region, while in the \nsouthern region, it ranks below all but cost of capital. Constraints related to capital and labor \ncosts are low in both regions. \n \n6.  External Constraints. Enterprises in the atolls rank labor issues high and perceive \nforeign  competition  to  be  a  threat  to  their  operations.  They  identify  bureaucratic  and \nadministrative  costs  related  to  fees,  licensing  costs,  and  permits;  and  customs  and  trade \nregulations  as  major  constraints.  Among  factors  having  a  negligible  constraint  on  the \nenterprises are utility costs; cost and access to finance; and access to land, utilities, and \ntransport facilities. Few enterprises actually consider using external financial sources. Similarly, \nland and transport services, normally considered to be important constraints, are not ranked as \nmajor  constraints  to  these  businesses  because  they  tend  to  operate  within  existing \ncircumstances and have limited expectations about changes in their operating environment. In \ncontrast, MSMEs operating principally in Mal\u00e9 report limited access to, and cost of, finance. \n \n7.  Skills  Deficiencies.  According  to  the  7th  National  Development  Plan  (NDP),  the \nMaldives has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in South Asia (47.7%). One \nproblem  is  the  lack  of  appropriate  skills  needed  for  existing  employment  opportunities. \nEducational and vocational institutions have not inculcated enterprise as a career option or \nprovided appropriate business orientation and support skills. Despite some improvement, lack of \nskilled labor continues to be a major problem, and has created reliance on migrant labor from \nneighboring countries. \n \n8.  Access to Financing. The Maldives ranks 132nd worldwide on the comparative ease of \ngetting credit; this is well below most other South Asian countries. The poor ranking is largely \ndue to the complete absence of a public or private credit registry to facilitate the exchange of \ncredit information among lenders. As a result, using a changing pool of assets as security for a \nloan is not practical. This makes security agreements for MSMEs highly risky, costly, and \ndifficult to enforce. Moreover, the financial sector of the Maldives is narrow with one locally \nowned commercial bank, Bank of Maldives (BML); branches of three South Asian commercial \nbanks; and a branch of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) international \nbank. Banking is regulated by Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), which acts as the central \nbank. The nonbank financial subsector comprises a government provident fund, a finance \nleasing company, a housing bank, two insurance companies registered in the country, and \nsome agents for overseas insurance companies. Capital market operations for securities trading \nare limited. Three state-owned enterprises are quoted on the stock exchange (BML, Maldivian \nTransport and Construction Company, and State Trading Organization). \n \n                                                 \n4  A survey was conducted on the ADB TA 4745 on Small and Medium Enterprise Development in 2007.

Business Development Services Centers (BDSCs) in Target Regions \n \n1.  Strategy and Organization. Field research conducted for the Project shows that the \neconomic activities of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the atolls are \nlimited. Two of the major obstacles are (i) limited access to all types of business development \nservices  (BDS)  like  information,  marketing  services,  communication,  and  training;  and  \n(ii) inability to access finance at reasonable costs. On the supply side, the atolls have no private \nsector-based providers of BDS, and only a few public sector providers through trainings on a \nnonregular basis. On the demand side, MSMEs are unaware of the concept of professional \nsupport for enterprise development, despite their urgent need for it. The current market volume \nof BDS is nonexistent, as all services from public providers are delivered free of cost. In the \nabsence of private sector BDS providers in the regions, as well as business membership \norganizations like chambers of commerce or business associations, business development \nservice centers (BDSCs) will be established as new institutions in each of the focal regions to \ndeliver BDS to MSMEs and to facilitate local economic development.   \n \n2.  Functions. The BDSCs will be the principal vehicle for delivery of BDS products to \nMSMEs and will facilitate cluster development in the atolls. Each focal region will have a BDSC \noperation desk in its key atoll; a central BDSC at Mal\u00e9 will offer a wide range of services to \nMSMEs and cooperative initiatives at cost-based prices. As neither start-ups nor established \nMSMEs have been exposed to the concept of professional, and demand-oriented delivery of \nBDS at market prices, they are unprepared to pay the cost-based price for such services. A \ncost-sharing  facility  (CSF)  will  be  established  as  the  principal  funding  mechanism  for  the \ndevelopment of a commercial BDS market. The CSF will enable the BDSCs to initially offer \nservices at a low and subsidized price. It will support the BDSCs in developing service products \nand provide substantial income to the BDSCs during the pilot operation of the CSF. The BDSCs \nwill have a business plan indicating core activities, required investment, and planned revenue \nstreams. They will develop a clear strategy comprising a vision, mission, goals, and line of \nactivities, as well as an annual operating plan.  \n \n3.  Objectives and Services to Be Provided. The BDSCs will have three objectives: (i) to \nprovide BDS products to start-ups and established MSMEs; (ii) to facilitate local economic \ndevelopment and cluster development in their respective regions; and (iii) to link start-ups and \nother types of MSMEs to financing opportunities. To meet its objectives, the BDSCs will offer a \nwide range of services classified in four categories: (i) consulting services for business planning \nand business counseling, identification and provision of information, and coaching; (ii) training \nservices on costing and pricing, marketing and sales, accounting, and entrepreneurship; (iii) \nservices for facilitating market access, access to finance, and formation of cooperatives; and (iv) \ngovernment-related services covering support for business registration and licensing, linking to \ngovernment databases and to government extension services. To sustain its pilot operation of \nthe  CSF,  the  BDSCs  are  envisaged  to  become  independent  and  market-oriented  service \nproviders with development and commercial objectives.  \n \n4.  Staffing. The project management unit (PMU) within the Enterprise Development Unit \n(EDU) will be the overall coordinating body for the BDSCs. It will disseminate information, and \nmonitor and evaluate BDSC services. The project coordinators of the PMU will be recruited on \nan international contract and work for 24 person-months intermittently for the duration of the \nProject.  The  project  coordinator  will  be  supported  by  one  national  MSME  portal  and \ncommunication specialist, and one national monitoring and evaluation specialist who will also \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \nwork for the duration of the Project. The PMU will share EDU administrative and support staff \nduring the pilot phase. \n \n5.  The central BDSC will be housed within EDU and comprise one BDS officer in the pilot \nphase,  and  need-based  consultants.  It  will  share  administrative  and  support  staff  already \npresent  within  EDU  during  the  pilot  phase.  The  BDSC  operation  desks  at  Hithadhoo  and \nKulhudhuffushi will be housed within the regional development and management offices. They \nwill  each  comprise  one  full-time  nationally  recruited  business  development  officer  for  the \nduration of the Project. One administrative staff and one support staff will be deputed from \namong existing staff of the regional development and management offices to these operation \ndesks to work on a full-time basis.  \n \n6.  The Project will provide capacity development support to EDU by financing the cost of \nthe project coordinator, MSME portal and communications specialist, monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist, and administrative staff. In addition, training programs will be conducted for regular \nEDU staff in marketing, financing, and communication skills. The Project will support EDU in \ndesigning and implementing a media campaign, and developing and registering an EDU web \nportal.    \n \n7.  The Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industries (MNCCI) and the Women \nEntrepreneurs Council (WEC) will supporting the operation of the BDSCs by providing linkages \nwith available markets and consulting service. The Project will support MNCCI in its strategic \nplanning  process,  including  the  elaboration  of  an  operations  plan  and  a  human  resource \ndevelopment plan, as well as training recruited professional staff. WEC needs a secretariat with \nsuitably  qualified  staff  to  undertake  quality  control,  inventory  management,  marketing,  and \nwebsite maintenance. The Project will support the capacity building of WEC to undertake such \nactivities more efficiently and provide extension services to the BDSCs.  \n \n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation on Performance Measurement. The BDSCs will establish \na performance measurement framework as a systematic tool for measuring operating results \nrelated to the centers\u2019 activities, including CSF-based financial support to entrepreneurs. Among \nthe information gathered by the centers and published on a quarterly basis will be the (i) number \nof  businesses  consulted;  (ii)  number  of  business  plans  prepared;  (iii)  number  of  financial \napplications  processed  for  each  of  the  financing  mechanisms  supported  by  the  BDSCs;  \n(iv) breakdown of clientele by sector and size of enterprises; (v) number of courses provided \nand participants in each course; (vi) participant evaluations of each training course; (vii) revenue \nfrom conditional support for successful applications to various financing mechanisms; (viii) other \nrevenue sources; and (ix) CSF management, allocation, and monitoring analysis. Each BDSC \n(central  and  local  operation  desks)  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  a  results-based \nmanagement and accountability framework.  \n \nB.  Cost-Sharing Facility on a Pilot Basis \n \n9.  Institutional Setup of a CSF. A CSF will be set up within the central BDSC. The central \nBDSC will act as the CSF management unit, headed by an international consultant. It will be \nresponsible for project analysis, dissemination of information, marketing, financial management, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and coordination with EDU and other government stakeholders.  \n \n10.  Principle of Services. The BDSCs will offer a wide range of services to MSMEs and \ncooperative initiatives at cost-based prices (paragraph 2). The CSF will enable the BDSCs to \ninitially offer services at a low, and subsidized price to demonstrate value for money, and \n ", "Appendix 5  39\nestablish successful case studies to generate demand for BDS on a market price basis in the \nfuture. Charging for services during the initial stage of the Project will ensure that only serious \ncases come to the BDSCs and that it is a demand-driven effort. \n \n11.  Administration Mechanism. The CSF PMU will work with a subcommittee for initial \nscreening and provision of its recommendations to the project steering committee for final \napproval of the cost-sharing grant. The BDSCs will be accountable to the project steering \ncommittee. The subcommittee will be chaired by the project coordinator with EDU, MNCCI, and \nWEC each nominating one representative. A quorum of three members will be required for \nfinalizing recommendations and taking decisions on forwarding the applications to the project \nsteering committee. The decisions of the subcommittee will be by majority vote with the project \ncoordinator retaining the veto right for nonapproval. The reasons for vetoing any proposal will be \nwell documented by the project coordinator.  \n \n12.  Eligible Applicants. The main target group for grants will be MSMEs with operations \nbased in the northern and southern regions, 1 and with 50 employees or less. One of the \nprerequisites for entrepreneurs to receive CSF support will be the completion of an application \nsubmitted to the CSF subcommittee through the BDSCs. Only domestically owned MSMEs or \nservice  providers  will  be  eligible.  Parastatals  (owned  or  controlled  wholly  or  partly  by  the \ngovernment),  government  entities,  and  other  MSMEs,  or  service  providers  where  the \ngovernment or its agencies have management control, by virtue of being the largest shareholder \nor by virtue of having a board majority, will not be eligible. The CSF supports group activities \ncovering more than one MSME or service provider, for instance, those sponsored by business \nor trade associations, MNCCI, WEC, or organized clusters where the benefits are widespread. \nApplications made on a group basis will be evaluated and processed as a single application.  \n \n13.  Size  of  Grant.  The  CSF  is  to  reduce  the  cost  of  external  service  provision  by \ncofinancing projects of applicants with a flat rate of 80% of the total project cost. The maximum \nindividual  support  under  the  CSF  will  be  Rf51,200  ($4,000),  with an  average  of  Rf25,600 \n($2,000), to assist a maximum of 200 projects during the implementation period on a pilot basis. \nHowever, large matching grants will have a maximum of Rf512,000 ($40,000) with an average \nof Rf192,000 ($15,000), to assist a maximum of 30 cooperative projects during the period.2 The \nCSF will limit applications by applying a minimum grant amount of Rf12,800 ($1,000) and a \nmaximum grant amount of Rf512,000 to maintain reasonable administrative costs and ensure \nthat the main beneficiaries are served.   \n \n14.  Eligible  Services. Clearly defined approval criteria will be prepared to support the \ndecision-making of the CSF subcommittee and project steering committee.

The TA included an MSME market survey and \nthe anticipated demand for grants, and maximum and average sizes under the CSF are calculated based on (i) the \nprojection of total average number of MSMEs during project implementation in targeted regions, based on the \nlatest statistics from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade; (ii) priority sectors (fishery processing, \nagricultural  commercialization,  handicrafts,  and  tourism-related  activities)  for  cooperative  efforts;  and  (iii) \ninformation on average yearly spending and sale size of MSMEs from the MSME survey.  \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nindividuals  and  groups  will  be  encouraged,  especially  from  cooperatives  or  cluster-based \ngroups. Examples of eligible services to be supported by the CSF will include training business \nmanagement courses, hiring a consultant to create new handicraft designs, hiring an expert to \nimprove  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  fish  processing,  developing  new  market  access,  and \nsupporting the application for financing to purchase capital equipment. For each eligible service \nusage supported by the CSF, the concerned MSME will be expected to provide at least one \ndeliverable. The CSF management unit will verify that the activity has taken place as approved. \nDepending on the circumstance, a defined deliverable may consist, for instance, of a detailed \nengineering  drawing,  a  product  prototype  incorporating  quality  improvements,  a  training \ncertificate, or an externally commissioned market report. Sample service usage includes in-\nfactory consultancy and short-term contract management services, for example, up to 3 months \nof an introduced expert would normally be eligible, but new permanent staff appointments would \nnot. The length of time for which temporary contract management could be supported will \ndepend on the time required for the required knowledge transfer and technical assistance. \nPriority will be given for services that can eventually be easily replicated. \n \n15.  Eligible  Expenditures.  Expenditures  on  service  fees,  and  travel  and  incidental \nexpenses charged at cost, incurred wholly and exclusively on a CSF-approved service and \ntravel usage will be eligible for grant support. Salaries for staff employed by the MSME and \nrecurring costs such as royalty fees will not be eligible. No single recipient MSME or group of \nMSMEs will receive total grants in excess of a cumulative limit of Rf512,000 ($40,000) unless \nexpressly approved by the project steering committee. \n \n16.  The CSF will operate on a first come, first served basis in northern and southern region. \nTo enhance transparency and efficiency of CSF implementation, the project coordinator will help \nwith management of the facility during the operation period to transfer facility management skills \nand expertise. \n \n ", "Appendix 6  41\nLINE OF CREDIT FACILITY PILOT OPERATION \n \n1.  Eligibility Criteria for Subloans. The line of credit facility (LCF) will be managed by \nBank of Maldives (BML) to promote micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by \nproviding them with financing for investment. The eligibility criteria for such financing will be (i) \nthe  MSME  has  50  or  fewer  employees  and  is  registered  in  the  MSME  database  of  the \nEnterprise  Development  Unit  (EDU);1 (ii)  the  MSME\u2019s  activities  focus  on  target  clusters \n(agricultural commercialization, fishery processing, handicrafts, and tourism-related activities); \n(iii) the MSME\u2019s operations are based on two focus regions (northern and southern domestic \nregions); and (iv) the MSME has adequate cash flow or enterprise budget as well as collateral. \nThe adequacy of cash flow, enterprise budget, and default risk assessment criteria will be well \ndefined  and  agreed  to  at  the  inception  of  the  facility  by  the  ADB,  BML,  and  EDU.  The \nGovernment is expected to retain the right to terminate or suspend the LCF after a specific \nduration to be specified at the initiation of LCF. \n \n2.  Relending. The Government will borrow from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and bear \nthe foreign exchange risk of the loan. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), on behalf \nof the Republic of the Maldives, will relend the loan to BML and enter into a subsidiary loan \nagreement with BML. MOFT will advance the LCF funds to BML semiannually based on the \nprojected loan processing amount over the next 6 months. The Government has indicated that \nthe loan term (Government to BML) will not exceed 24 years, including a 3-year grace period, \nwith the Government retaining the right to close the LCF. The LCF loan will be disbursed over 3 \nyears, subject to a midterm review after 18 months to review disbursement progress and refine \nthe arrangements as needed.  \n \n3.  Onlending  Loan  Size  and  Costs.  BML  will  undertake  an  independent  credit  risk \nassessment analysis for proposals to determine if they meet the lending criteria agreed among \nthe Government, ADB, and BML2. If the credit risk assessment is satisfactory, BML will approve \nthe  subloan  and  execute  an  onlending  agreement.  Onlending  agreements  will  be  signed \nbetween BML and the subborrower on terms and conditions, as agreed among the Government, \nADB, and BML. BML will submit a report on approved subloans and a copy of onlending \nagreements to MOFT. The maximum subloan size for individual applicants will be Rf1,024,000 \n($80,000) and the anticipated average subloan size is Rf512,000 ($40,000). It is expected that \nBML will provide around 70 MSMEs with subloans under LCF. Any deviation will be subject to \nADB\u2019s prior approval. The terms of lending will be on a commercial basis at the prevailing \nmarket rates of interest and tenor, reflecting costs of raising such funds locally and guaranteeing \nadequate spread of interest rates for BML to cover transaction costs and risks. The subborrower \nwill  be  required  to  pay  an  upfront  processing  fee3 as  per  the  current  processing  fee \nrequirements being followed by BML. Subborrowers will have to provide any assets acquired \nwith the credit line subloan as collaterals. The grace period and a maximum maturity will be \ndecided based on the reasonable assessment of amount and maturity of credit demand by the \ntargeted MSME at the initial stage of implementation.4 Implementation of the scheme will be \n                                                 \n1  About 1,000 MSMEs from two targeted regions are registered with the EDU MSME database. \n2   Development  Banking  Cell  (DBC)  within  BML  has  experience  of  conducting  credit  analysis  under  other \ndevelopment projects provided by ADB and other donors (Please see Supplementary Appendix C: Bank of \nMaldives Due Diligence). \n3   In the Maldives, the \u2019upfront processing fee\u2019 is considered to be as a \u2019guarantee fee.\u2019 The guarantee fee will cover \nthe cost of application processing as well as discourage non-serious applications.    \n4  Detailed LCF onlending commercial terms and manuals are to be reviewed as part of ADB TA 4745. ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. Manila (TA \n4745-MLD, approved on 19 December, for $600,000). \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \nbased on a selective approach in which subloans are extended on a case-by-case basis. BML \nwill  lend  from  the  LCF  on  less  restrictive  collateral  requirements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, and incorporated in the subsidiary loan agreement between BML and \nthe Government. \n \n4.  Onlending  Default  Coverage.  To  provide  BML  with  an  incentive  for  onlending  to \nMSMEs in designated local atolls with less restrictive collateral, which is the core of the Project \nin line with the purpose of the loan under the LCF, the Government will provide BML with an \n80% guarantee for defaulted subloans. BML will bear the remaining risk to ensure that MBL \ncontinues to be diligent in its onlending activities. BML and the Government will agree on the \nlength of time after which the subloan is considered to be in default; this will be documented in \nthe relevant onlending agreement. The default rate will be a prime determinant of the scheme\u2019s \nviability. A default rate between 2% and 3% should be targeted; the maximum acceptable rate \nshould be 6%. \n \n5.  Onlending  Procedures.  The  business  development  services  centers  (BDSCs)  will \nassist the subborrower in preparing the subloan applications and forward them to BML with \nbusiness plans and financial requirement information submitted by or consulted with the MSME \napplicant. Upon receipt of these documents, BML will undertake an independent credit risk \nassessment analysis to determine whether it meets the lending criteria agreed among the \nGovernment, ADB, and BML. Upon completion of scrutiny, BML will decide whether to approve \nthe subloan. If approved, BML will execute an onlending agreement with the subborrower and \nsubmit a report on approved subloans and a copy of onlending agreements to MOFT. The \ndisbursement of the subloan will be made with reference to the BDSCs. Time limits for BML to \nundertake the credit risk assessment will be agreed upon at the time of finalizing the operating \nprocedures  for  the  LCF.  EDU  in  coordination  with  the  BDSCs  will  be  responsible  for \nencouraging use of the LCF.  \n \n6.  Proposed  Pilot  Operation  and  Targeted  Subloans.  Technical  assistance \nconsultancies will be provided to BML and EDU at the initial stage of loan implementation to \ndevelop  and  detail  LCF  operating  procedures.  The  pilot  phase  will  focus  on  institutional \norganization and staffing, capacity development, and implementation of a pilot LCF of $3.0 \nmillion to provide about 70 subloans. Depending on outcomes of the LCF pilot operation, the \nsecond phase will establish regular LCF operation with a further fund contribution.5 The first two \nsubloans during the pilot operation will be referred to ADB for its prior monitoring and review. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  The assumption is that if BML becomes competent by this period, then it will introduce a credit guarantee product \nin the near future. During the regular operation, the number of credit lines will be dependent on loan recoveries, \nany further capitalization of the fund, and acceptable leverage by BML. \n ", "Appendix 6  43\nTable A6: Line of Credit Facility \nPhase I: Pilot Operation   Planned Phase II: Regular \nItem \nFY2008\u2013FY2011  Operations FY2011 Onward \nFund size ($)  3,000,000  Additional Funda \nMaximum subloan (Rf)  1,024,000  1,024,000 \nAverage subloan (Rf)  512,000  512,000 \nLoan target(Number by the  Based on loan recoveries and \nAbout 70 subloans \nend of period)  available capital \nUpfront fee from borrower \n1.5% of the subloan size  1.5% of the subloan size \n(%) \nDefault coverage (%)  80% by the Government  Based on loan recoveries and lessons\na    A  phase  II  project  is  scheduled  to  be  processed  during  2009\u20132010.

BML\u2019s Obligation to ADB. BML will conduct its business in accordance with sound \nbanking, administrative, financial, environmental, and business practices. BML will notify ADB \nand afford ADB adequate opportunity to comment prior to (i) selling, leasing, transferring, or \notherwise disposing of any of its assets, except in the ordinary course of its business; or (ii) \nestablishing or acquiring any subsidiary. \n \n8.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Development Support to BML. Capacity \nbuilding will facilitate BML administration of the LCF. BML will provide office infrastructure and \nequipment to the LCF, thus ensuring that the fund capital can be fully utilized for credit line \nsubloans. In contrast to creating a new LCF institution, its placement as a division of BML offers \nthe following advantages: (i) the LCF can use existing facilities (BML head office and branches \nin outer atoll islands), and possibly draw on existing staff and institutional capacities such as \nsecretarial support, accounting, and product advertisement; (ii) career development will be \nenhanced, thereby making the LCF attractive to well-qualified staff; and (iii) mutual synergies \nwill exist between BML and the businesses, such as extending the range of collateral-based \nlending, based on lessons from the pilot operation.  \n \n9.  Technical assistance will be provided to BML for developing and detailing the operating \nprocedures of the LCF. An LCF manager will form an LCF desk within BML. Even though the \nLCF subloans are for clients in the outer atolls in the northern and southern regions, the facility \nwill be domiciled in the head office of BML in Mal\u00e9, which is geographically situated in the \ncenter of the country. Moreover, the advantages of establishing the LCF as a BML desk can \nbest be realized if the LCF operations are located within BML\u2019s head office. Moreover, based on \nthe experiences of the Project and the capacity built within BML, BML would be able to continue \nfacility operations as a credit guarantee facility, a new product offering, beyond the Project \nperiod. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \nPROCUREMENT PLAN \nA.

This  assessment  of  good  governance  and  corruption  conforms  with  the \nrecommendations  of  the  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan1 of  the  ADB,  which \nspecifies  that  program  design  should  incorporate  findings  of  governance,  institutional,  and \ncorruption risks assessments, and that the project documentation clearly identify risks, risk \nmanagement and mitigation measures. This summary assessment covers (i) relevant issues in \nprivate sector development, (ii) relevant risk analysis, including specification of (a) underlying \nassumptions in the risk analysis; (b) various potential risks in the Project and parties who bears \nthem;  (c)  perceived  severity  of  the  risks;  (d)  review  of  ongoing  and  proposed  mitigation \nmeasures to address the risks; and (e) residual risks, if any; and (iii) recommendations on how \nthe assessment findings can be incorporated in the project design.  \n \nA.  Private Sector Development \n \n2.  The Government dominates the economy in the Maldives; most of the key business \nactivities are carried out by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The policy environment has not \nbeen conducive to the development of the private sector. Government ownership, whether full \nor partial, is still widespread in every sector except tourism. In addition, the Government has \nhad  little  experiences  with  PPP  through  build-own-operate  and  build-own-operate-transfer \nmechanisms. The share of the gross domestic product (GDP) absorbed by government output \nincreased from 8.4% of GDP in 1984 to 12.4% in 2004, as civil service employment increased \nfivefold in 20 years. \n \n3.  SOEs play an important role in the economy given that most large enterprises are in the \npublic sector. They currently dominate almost all significant sectors (such as civil aviation, \nfinancial services, fisheries, public utilities, and telecommunications). Concerns about the limited \ncapacity of the private sector, possibility of private monopolies due to the small size of the \ndomestic market, and the desire to benefit potential scale economies in production have been \namong the factors that explain the Maldives\u2019 sizable SOE sector. \n \n4.  The  Government  recently  indicated  its  full  commitment  to  SOE  restructuring  and \nprivatization.  This  comes  as  the  Government  increasingly  recognizes  that  with  increased \nparticipation of the private sector in the economy, the rationale for retaining public ownership of \ncompanies  is  weakening.  Moreover,  recommended  business  profit  tax  would  provide  a \nreplacement for the dividends currently being received from profit-making SOEs. \n \n5.  While the foundations or architecture for implementing a privatization strategy need to be \nestablished, the Government has adopted a parallel course of action to move forward with the \nprivatization  agenda.  This  comprises  developing  the  foundations  for  privatization  while \nsimultaneously privatizing priority SOEs and other actions such as divesting shares of the \nHousing Finance Corporation to multilateral financial institutions. This is to be followed by the \nadoption of a privatization law. The Public Enterprise Monitoring and Evaluation Board will \nsimultaneously require upgrading to become the nodal agency in the Government responsible \nfor implementing SOE privatization and restructuring. The board currently has five staff; the \nGovernment will need to strengthen its capacity. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Underlying Assumptions. The main underlying assumptions made in this risk analysis \nare that (i) consensus is considerable on the need for reforms to address structural constraints, \nand the Government will continue political and economic reforms; (ii) the Government must \nurgently  strengthen  the  private  sector  if  the  country  is  to  increase  its  growth  rate;  and  \n(iii) effective institutional building in key institutions will proceed as currently planned.  \n \n8.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Project encourages market-based strategies and actively promotes competition, innovation, and resilient PPPs. \nTo foster greater private sector participation in line with the 7th National Development Plan, the Project envisages \nthe Government and the private sector working as partners to improve corporate governance and transparency, and \nmaximizes the potential of PPPs with a view to providing opportunities for MSMEs to participate in a more \ncompetitive environment. The Project is also in line with ADB\u2019s CPS 2007\u20132011.a The CPS identifies key indicators \nincluding business model development linked to the markets, with enhanced access to financing and improved PPP \ndevelopment. Once readiness is secured, ADB\u2019s second phase of assistance would include support for investment \nprojects to leverage institutional strengthening measures already in place.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues. In 2004, the Government conducted a second vulnerability and poverty assessmentb (VPA2) \ncovering the households on 200 inhabited islands. During 1997\u20132004, the Maldives made impressive progress in its \nsocioeconomic development with per capita household income in the atolls increasing by about 50%. A significant \nreduction in poverty was achieved everywhere in the region with the percentage of people having less than Rf10 \n(around $1) per day decreasing from 20% in 1997 to 10% in 2004. Similarly in 1997, 60% of the population had less \nthan Rf20 and, in 2004, 35%. Nonetheless, income distribution remains unequal especially between Mal\u00e9 and the \natolls. Given the relation between economic activity and geographic dispersion for Mal\u00e9 between 1997 and 2004 the \ngini coefficient actually rose from 0.12 to 0.18. With respect to access to basic public services, the VPA2 notes that \naccess to educational services for the population living in the atolls increased quite substantially. In 2004, two thirds \nof the people living on islands were offered education up to grade 10 compared to one fourth in 1997. Since 1997, \ninfant mortality has decreased, while life expectancy has improved from 62 to 68. Over the last few years, constraints \non physical infrastructure have improved, and now 24-hour electricity supply is available to nearly all islands. The \nbuilding of new harbors and jetties has resulted in two thirds of the island population always being accessible by \nboat. The situation for women in the Maldives is continuously improving. They have achieved parity in both primary \nand secondary education. Progress has also been made in meeting nutritional requirements.  \n \nIn 2002, the Government and the ADB signed a poverty reduction partnership agreement defining a long-term vision \nfor  poverty  reduction.  It  sets  out  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  priorities  and  targets  to  monitor  progress. \nInnovations in governance and fiscal consolidation are among the key instruments envisaged in the agreement to \nreduce poverty incidence and to expand access to economic infrastructure and quality social services in the atolls.  \n \n2. Design Features. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction in general in the Maldives in several aspects. \nFirst, it is expected to contribute to an improved business environment for MSMEs with enhanced institutional \ncapacity and financial services outreach, improved access to credit by MSMEs through better use of credit \ninformation, and increased BDS for enterprises to access training, consulting, and marketing and information. Given \nthe targeted enterprises are located in the northern and southern regions with equal to or less than 50 employees, \nthe Project is expected to increase business activities and employment ratio and contribute to income generation in \nthese remote regions. Second, the Project will assist the Maldives in developing and delivering critical infrastructure \nand services projects through private investment, thereby reducing government\u2019s financial burden, and enhancing \nprivate sector participation and business expansion by MSME. The PPP will induce private sector investment into \nsocial infrastructure, including power generators, transportation, water treatment facilities, and to their operation and \nmaintenance. Third, capacity development initiatives under the Project will facilitate the operations of these reform \ninitiatives, and provide long-term sustainability over and beyond the Project period which would be essential to \nensure  that  the  expected  benefits  in  terms  of  poverty  reduction  are  efficiently  and  effectively  achieved  and \ndistributed.   \n \n \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe private sector in the Maldives has a dualistic structure. Ninety percent of firms are indigenous that are either \nowner-operated or microenterprises with fewer than three employees. At the other end of the spectrum are a large \nnumber of foreign direct investors, principally involved in the management of tourist resorts and public utilities. The \nMSMEs are confronted with major obstacles such as high costs and limited access to finance, lack of skilled labor, \nasymmetries of market information and business related expertise, poorly developed interisland transportation, and \nhigh cost of power generation. Moreover, according to the 2006 census, 8.3% of the adult population is unable to \nfind suitable employment or lacks employment opportunities.
