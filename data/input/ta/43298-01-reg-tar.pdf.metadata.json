INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assess  and  help  remove  policy,  regulatory, \nsupervisory,  and  information  barriers  to  the  introduction  of  microinsurance  throughout  the \nPeople's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  Mongolia.  It  will  (i)  analyze  legal,  regulatory,  and \nsupervisory structures and policy approaches, as well as institutions, to determine the enabling \nenvironment for microinsurance; (ii) conduct a complete demand and supply map, including the \nassessment of challenges such as literacy and local capacity to handle actuarial and other \ntechnical needs for this type of product; (iii) evaluate pilot projects; and (iv) assist insurance \nregulators to develop and implement a road map for policy, regulatory and supervisory reforms \nto facilitate microinsurance growth. Missions visited Mongolia on 14\u201317 February 2009 and the \nPRC on 1\u20133 April 2009 to determine the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements, \nand reconfirmed arrangements on 5\u201311 March 2010 in Mongolia and on 15\u201318 March 2010 in \nthe PRC.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Microinsurance is defined in an International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) \nissues paper as \u201cinsurance that is accessed by the low-income population, provided by a variety \nof different entities, but run in accordance with generally accepted insurance practices (which \nshould include the Insurance Core Principles). Importantly, this means that the risk insured \nunder  a  microinsurance  policy  is  managed  based  on  insurance  principles  and  funded  by \npremiums.\u201d2  Microinsurance is a relatively new addition to the range of services to help poorer \nhouseholds gain access to finance and has a unique ability to lower household insecurity. \n \n3.  Poverty is perpetuated by household inability to manage vulnerability caused by the \nsudden death of a family member, illness, or loss of income or property. A special study by the \nAsian  Development  Bank (ADB)  Independent Evaluation  Department found  that  household \nvulnerability was a primary cause of new poverty.3 Major vulnerability factors identified in the \nPRC-specific appendix of the study included (i) serious or chronic illness of family members and \n(ii)  investment failures due  to  price fluctuations,  epidemic  outbreaks of  animal  disease,  or \nnatural disasters. During emergencies, rural households look for immediately available funds. \nWhile in both the PRC and Mongolia households use a variety of informal methods to manage \nrisk (including selling remaining assets, borrowing, and sharing money and goods with those \nwho have experienced losses), these techniques do not prevent poverty or effectively manage \nvulnerability. \n \n4.  Insurance can play an important role in mitigating risks faced by poor households, yet \nstandard  insurance  services  are  out  of  reach  for  millions  of  the  poor  and  disadvantaged. \nMicroinsurance can help these households to manage risks and have cash available when \nemergencies arise. Products are tailored to this market in terms of pricing, types of insurance \nservices,  and  ways  they  are  delivered.  Microinsurance  is  a  sustainable,  private-sector-led \nsolution.  As  mentioned  in  a  2009  study  by  Nankai  University  in  the  PRC  \"\u2026  generally \nmicroinsurance  is  for  persons  ignored  by  mainstream  commercial  and  social  insurance \nschemes, persons who have not had access to appropriate products. Of particular interest is the \nprovision of cover to persons working in the informal economy who do not have access to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 15 May 2009. \n2  IAIS and the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, Microinsurance Working Group. 2007.

This paragraph wording has been drawn directly from the study (p. 84). \n ", " 2 \ncommercial insurance nor social protection benefits provided by employers directly, or by the \ngovernment through employers.\" 4 \n \n5.  In  2007,  a  100-country  study  on  microinsurance  reported  that  78  million  people \nworldwide  have  some form  of microinsurance to  help  them manage  risk,  and  that  private \ninsurance firms are \"realistically optimistic about the prospects of growth in a huge un-served \nmarket.\" 5 The study also revealed that (i) the potential microinsurance market was 30 times the \ncurrent  size;  (ii)  the  vast  majority  of  microinsurance  clients  purchase  their  coverage  from \ncommercial  insurers;  (iii)  improvements  in  regulation  have  strong  and  positive  impacts  on \nmicroinsurance  growth,  particularly  in  countries  with  large  populations;  and  (iv)  there  is \nextremely limited development partner involvement in the sector, and development partners can \nbest assist in review and reforms of policy, regulation and supervision.  \n \n6.  Three  aspects  of  microinsurance  are  unique  in  helping  poorer  households  access \nfinance:   \n(i)  Microinsurance  products  are  developed  mainly  by  deepening  markets  of  insurance \nproviders. The  providers  are familiar  with the  background  work  needed for product \ndevelopment, costing, and pricing. The main challenges are properly identifying the \ntarget  market  and  risks  for  smaller  products,  and  setting  up  appropriate  delivery \nchannels to sell premiums and pay claims. These steps have not yet been taken in the \nPRC and Mongolia because insurers are uncertain of market profitability.  \n(ii) Regulation of microinsurance providers is easier to delineate and does not require\u2014as \nmicrofinance may\u2014a completely different approach. Insurance regulation is generally \namenable to review and amendment.  \n(iii) Clients are likely to find it more difficult to understand the nature and usefulness of \nmicroinsurance products than of microsavings and microloan products. Thus, the uptake \nof  microinsurance  hinges  on  better  client  information  and  education,  and  more \ninnovation in communications with potential customers. \n \n7.  Regulation and supervision of insurance in many countries is not conducive to the \nsupply of insurance products and services suited to the poor. Regulatory problems can include \n(i) the microinsurance concept; (ii) its intermediation; (iii) institutional arrangements, including \nagents, products, and contracts; (iv) administration and supervision; and (v) a generally non-\nexistent or weak consumer protection framework. A five-country study of microinsurance policy, \nregulation, and supervision in 2009 found that (i) proactive and inclusive policy and regulatory \napproaches are important for supporting microinsurance development; (ii) regulatory uncertainty \nundermines microinsurance  development;  (iii)  the  overall  regulatory  burden  determines  the \nneed for a dedicated microinsurance dispensation; (iv) regulators and supervisors need a clear \nmandate to support development; (v) similar treatment for insurers facing similar risks and \nstrong  corporate  governance  are  important;  (vi)  tiering  and  graduation  can  help  informal \ninsurers grow in a sound way; and (vii) the low-risk features of microinsurance products allow \nregulators to structure regulatory definitions suited to the risk.6 \n \n8.  The PRC and Mongolia are in the nascent phases of microinsurance. Market potential is \nestimated by private insurers to be at least 200 million clients in the PRC, and about 400,000 in \n                                                \n4  J. Shengzong. 2009.

Washington, DC. \n ", "  3 \n \nMongolia. The China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) and the Financial Regulatory \nCommission of Mongolia (FRC) have identified microinsurance as an important new product \nand  wish  to  review  market  conditions,  improve  regulations,  and  support  pilot  projects  to \nintroduce microinsurance to the market.  \n \n9.  There  is  strong  justification  for  the  TA  under  the  ADB  Microfinance  Development \nStrategy,  the  two  countries'  country  partnership  strategies,  and  earlier  TA  projects.  The \nMicrofinance  Development  Strategy  confirms  the  role  of  ADB  in  strengthening  regulatory \nregimes for products such as microinsurance. 7 The finance sector road map in the PRC country \npartnership strategy 2008\u20132010 provides for ADB to support the government in developing \npolicy and regulatory reform, and strengthening cooperation among financial regulators.8 The \nMongolia  country  strategy  and  program  update  2007\u20132009  provides  for  expanded  capital \nmarket growth by TA and potential equity involvement in the insurance sector.9 ADB's current \nTA  projects  for  microinsurance  in  Bangladesh  and  Sri  Lanka,  and  prior  successes  in \nstrengthening  insurance  regulators  in  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  greatly  help  microinsurance \ndevelopment. \n \n10.  Proposed donor partnerships in both countries and internationally are important in the \nTA.  The  Access  to  Insurance  Initiative  (A2II)  was  launched  in  October  2009  as  a  new \ncollaborative approach between international development agencies and insurance supervisors \nthrough the IAIS. This global program is designed to strengthen the capacity and understanding \nof insurance supervisors, and to facilitate their role in expanding access to insurance markets. It \nis expected to (i) contribute toward an improved policy, regulatory and supervisory environment \nconsistent with international insurance standards; (ii) encourage investment in the insurance \nsector;  and  (iii)  develop  sustainable  microinsurance  operations  in  emerging  markets.  The \nsecretariat of the initiative is hosted by German development cooperation through GTZ and is \nlocated in Germany. The A2II will (i) support partner countries in assessing their policy and \nmarket  environment  via  country  studies,  with  five  countries  already  completed  under  a \nstandardized  methodology;  (ii)  help  develop  reform  strategies;  and  (iii)  contribute  to  the \ncontinuous  work  of  the  IAIS  in  awareness  creation,  dialogue  and  capacity  building,  and \ndevelopment of standards and guidance.  \n \n11.  Cofinancing and parallel financing proposals have been made for various tasks under \nthe TA. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has just started a $1.5 million \ncapacity development program in Mongolia to support the development of microinsurance. The \nFinancial Systems Development Program of GTZ (PRC)\u2014financed by the German Federal \nMinistry of Environment\u2014is assisting CIRC in the development of weather-based insurance \nproducts and in the start-up of microinsurance. Both UNDP and GTZ have approached ADB to \nwork as partners. UNDP has requested that ADB build on its initial review of regulations and \nconduct a detailed regulatory assessment in Mongolia, share the results, and begin capacity \nbuilding of the regulator. GTZ has proposed parallel cofinancing of the country assessment in \nthe PRC as well as of the implementation of the road map for reform. Accordingly, the TA will \nprovide parallel cofinancing for (i) the PRC country study and (ii) capacity building for regulators \nin both countries. The TA will fully fund (i) the Mongolia country study, and (ii) design and initial \nimplementation of reform road maps for each country based on the findings of country studies. \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2000.

The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  to  enable  private  sector  and  public  provision  of \nmicroinsurance in PRC and Mongolia. The outcome will be an improved policy and regulatory \nenvironment for microinsurance in PRC and Mongolia. The outcome will enable insurance firms \nin both countries to provide microinsurance products to poor households to better manage risk \nand protect themselves against sudden death, illness or injury of household members, or loss of \nincome or property. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The A2II methodology for country studies will be used. The official A2II methodology and \nactivities are summarized in Appendix 3. The following specific activities will be undertaken as \npart of the country studies: \n(i)  conduct  a  demand  and  supply-side  analysis  (including  assessment  of  pilot \nprojects), as well as a policy, regulatory and supervisory assessment, to map the \ninsurance and microinsurance landscape; \n(ii)  review the general policy, regulatory, and supervisory context using the IAIS self-\nassessment tool, which is based on the IAIS insurance core principles; \n(iii)  investigate  a  set  of  specific  issues  that  may  emerge  from  the  analysis  and \nreviews,  including  member-owned  microinsurers,  risk-based  microinsurance \nregime,  microinsurance  products,  government  and  development  partner \nsubsidies, reinsurance, financial education, consumer protection, and supervision; \n(iv)  formulate strategies for all participants that will support the development of the \nmicroinsurance market;  \n(v)  provide support for the wider dissemination of the findings within that country as \nwell as the implementation of recommendations through stakeholder dialogue \nworkshops at the beginning and toward the end of this process; and  \n(vi)  provide inputs, based on the country studies, to the global work of the IAIS \nregarding  standard  setting,  guidance,  and  training  processes,  as  well  as \nexpanding awareness of microinsurance in the region and globally.  \n \n14.  The TA outputs will include, for the PRC and Mongolia, (i) a country assessment report \nof  the  market  and  policy  environment for  microinsurance,  (ii)  an  evaluation  of  the  current \nmicroinsurance pilots; (iii) a road map for policy, regulatory improvements; and (iv) the first set \nof reforms being implemented, and initial market barriers removed. Key activities will include (i) \nforging an agreement between A2II, GTZ Financial Sector Development Programme (PRC), \nand  ADB  to  finance  and  implement  the  two  country  studies  and  other  work;  (ii)  planning \ninception workshops with key stakeholders to introduce the TA and make arrangements for a \nparticipatory approach; (iii) completing the country studies; (iv) reviewing microfinance pilot \nactivities; (v) helping develop road maps for regulatory reform; (vi) mentoring the regulators to \nimplement the first regulatory changes; and (vii) sharing the lessons in the region and globally.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.   The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \n ", "  5 \n \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility.10 Counterpart costs of $100,000 equivalent will be \nprovided in kind by insurance regulators and private insurance companies in the form of office \nspace and communications, and counterpart staff salaries, and travel costs as appropriate.  \nFunding of $178,000 will be provided and administered by German development cooperation \nthrough GTZ (PRC) in parallel cofinancing to provide additional international consultants and \ncover related expenses. The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as \nwell as training, workshops, publications, and miscellaneous expenses. The cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will begin in May 2010 and end in October 2012, with an implementation period \nof 29 months. ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by the Financial \nSector, Public Management and Regional Cooperation Division of the East Asia Department.  \n \n17.  A memorandum of agreement with GTZ (as the A2II secretariat and host under the \ncharter) will be signed to implement the TA activities, consistent with the A2II and TA objectives. \nADB  will  work with A2II and GTZ to determine specific and appropriate arrangements for \nimplementation  and  reporting  consistent  with  similar  development  partner  arrangements, \nincluding consultant terms of reference, selection, and field implementation. Consultants will be \nselected by GTZ using ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Procurement of goods and services will be undertaken by GTZ in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Funding will be provided \nin two tranches, the second tranche due after receipt of the draft country studies. Accounts and \naudits will be accepted under GTZ rules. Funding of $112,500 (15% of the total ADB TA \ncontribution, 13.23% of total costs) will be provided to GTZ to cover administrative fees and \nsignificant  additional  activities  of  the  A2II,  including  country  comparisons  and  international \ndialogue and standards setting on microinsurance development and supervision. These funds \nwill extend the results of the TA beyond the region for international impact.  \n \n18.  Counterpart staff and data access will be provided by both CIRC and FRC. Data access \nand time from insurance companies and provincial regulatory groups will be needed under a \nparticipatory approach. No-objection letters will be obtained before the start of the TA activities \n(as agreed during the TA fact-finding mission).  \n \n19.  The TA will provide two major formal outputs (the country study and the road map) and \ntwo workshops for regulators and the industry in each country, as well as one international \nworkshop that will be conducted after the country studies have been completed to discuss \nlessons learned. CIRC and FRC will monitor changes caused by the activities under the road \nmap and report. The secretariat of A2II will oversee the consistency of the work to implement \nthe country study and the steps taken under the road map, and will manage all reporting of field \nprogress under the TA according to the format and timing in the memorandum of agreement.  \n \nIV.

Purpose \n1.  This document describes the objectives, scope and approach to be followed in the \nindividual country studies carried out under the auspices of the Access to Insurance Initiative \n(A2II) project. It also contains a typical work plan for such a country study as well as the \nproposed approach to resourcing and staffing the work.  \nB.  Objectives \n2.  The overall objectives of the country studies are to produce diagnostic assessments of \nthe key  constraints  imposed  by  policy,  regulation,  and  supervision  on  the  development  of \nmicroinsurance markets in each country, and to develop recommendations to national policy \nmakers, regulators and supervisors on how these can be addressed. \nC.  Approach (outline methodology) \n3.  This section sets out the substantive tasks to be performed as part of each country study \nto achieve the objectives.  \n1.  Market Analysis \n4.  The market analysis seeks to develop an integrated picture of the forces that have \nshaped and will shape the development of the microinsurance market in a particular country. It \nhas  three  distinctive  components:  a  demand-side  analysis,  a  supply-side  analysis,  and  a \nregulatory analysis. \n5.  Demand-side analysis. The demand-side analysis tries to paint a picture of the current \nusage  of,  and  the  potential  demand  for,  microinsurance  products  among  the  low-income \npopulation in a country. Specific aspects in the demand-side overview include: \n(i)  general economic and demographic profile: income levels, urbanization level, \nnature of employment, and sources of income; \n(ii)  estimates  of  the  current  take-up  of  formal  insurance  and,  specifically,  any \nmicroinsurance products that can be identified; \n(iii)  estimates of the current take-up of informal means of risk mitigation; \n(iv)  specific  risks  faced  in  a  country  by  low-income  households  as  well  as  an \nappreciation of the priority given by low-income households to mitigating the \nvarious risks; \n(v)  the penetration of social welfare and other government support networks;  \n(vi)  community  structure  and  social  cohesion  determining  whether,  for  example, \nmutual/cooperative risk management structures have evolved; \n(vii)  perceptions,  knowledge,  and  awareness  by  the  poor  of  formal  financial \ninstitutions and specifically insurance; and \n(viii)  general  picture  of  financial  and  economic  management  of  low-income \nhouseholds to gain an understanding of how insurance may fit into this. \n \n ", "10   Appendix 3   \n6.  As far as possible the focus group research will be professionally outsourced. The \ndiscussion guides1 will be based on ones used in previous country studies, but adapted in each \ncase to local circumstances, local language, and cultural orientation. \n7.  Supply-side analysis. The purpose of this component is to build an understanding of \nthe players and products in the insurance market as well as the context in which they operate. \nThis will cover the complete insurance value chain and will consider the following issues:  \n(i)  Overall  insurance  industry  performance  and  trends,  including  nature  and \ncategories of players and products in the market, nature of distribution and the \nentities involved, and the presence of foreign players. \n(ii)  The presence of informal insurers and insurance mechanisms and their ability to \nlink with the formal financial sector as well as the potential to formalize some of \nthem since not all informal providers of insurers may be illegal but, in many cases, \nare simply unregulated. \n(iii)  Government  participation  in  the  market  as  provider  or  intermediary  or  as \nclient/aggregator. \n(iv)  The broader financial sector on which the insurance sector relies, including the \nrelevant issues of the penetration of bank accounts and the cost of utilizing this \nfor  premium  collection;  the  nature  and  development  of  the  credit  market \n(including  microfinance  institutions,  the  state  of  the  payment  system,  the \nenvironment around e-money); and the availability of non-bank payment system \npartners (e.g., mobile phone networks). \n(v)  Economic context, which will cover the general economic trends and dynamics \nthat may impact on the development of microinsurance. Issues of relevance \ninclude prevailing macroeconomic conditions, substantial processes of economic \nrestructuring, and the level of formality in the economy (e.g., a large reliance on \nthe informal economy means that incomes tend to be less secure and more \nerratic;  it  will  also  be  more  difficult  to  partner  with  informal  employers  for \ndistribution). \n(vi)  The nature and potential role of nonfinancial sector players (such as mobile \nphone networks, retail stores, trade unions) as potential partners in distribution. \n \n8.  Regulatory and Supervisory Practices Framework (regulatory scheme). Drawing on \nthe findings of previous country studies, especially the key regulatory drivers of microinsurance \ndevelopment, this component will consider the full body of policy and regulation, as well as \nsupervisory capacity, that impact on the development of the insurance market. It will consider \nthe following issues: \n(i)  policy in support of market development and/or financial inclusion (what is the \npolicy priority given to financial sector development and insurance in particular? \nmore  specifically,  does  the  government  have  a  formal  policy  on  financial \ninclusion and what does this entail? have particular regulations been passed to \npromote financial inclusion, not only in the insurance sphere, but also wider?);  \n(ii)  specific  insurance  regulation  that  exists  covering  legislation,  regulations  and \nother subordinate regulation (circulars, etc.) that set out the general regulatory \nframework for insurance, particularly the aspects of prudential, market conduct \nand product regulation and the regulatory risks and challenges faced in the \ncountry (including the capacity of the regulator/supervisor for insurance);  \n(iii)  consumer protection and recourse, including consumer education;  \n                                                \n1  The questionnaire will be used by the facilitator as the basis for discussion in each focus group session. \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(iv)  the regulation of the broader financial sector, which may include relevant bank \nregulations, regulations of multilateral financial institutions and NGOs providing \nfinancial services, general market conduct regulations and regulations specific to \ncredit providers (as this may be of relevance to credit life insurance and bank \ninsurance models); \n(v)  nonfinancial regulation as far as it impacts on the development of the insurance \nsector, including areas such as tax legislation and anti-money laundering and \nknow your customer requirements; and  \n(vi)  the institutional environment in which the financial sector and insurance market \noperates: the regulatory and supervisory framework for cooperatives in general, \nand for mutual insurers, institutional requirements on insurers and intermediaries, \ngovernance, etc. \n \n2.  Review of General Regulatory and Supervisory Context for Insurance \n9.  The IAIS has indicated that it would prefer the country assessments to incorporate a \nfairly  complete  assessment  (extending  beyond  microinsurance)  of  the  regulatory  and \nsupervisory regime and capacity in the target countries, using the insurance core principles as a \nbasis. The exact nature of these assessments will be finalized in consultation with the IAIS. The \ninsurance core principles self-assessment program can be used as a point of departure for such \nan assessment. The product of this assessment will be twofold: a confidential report to the \nnational insurance supervisor, as well as input to the regulation, supervision and policy analysis \nupon which the conclusions and recommended microinsurance strategy will be based. \n3.  Recommended Microinsurance Strategy  \n10.  The market analysis and regulation, supervision and policy review will culminate in a set \nof findings and recommendations. The findings need to be comprehensive and substantive \nenough to justify  a  set  of recommendations for  national  policy  and  regulatory  changes  (if \nrequired) and also to provide inputs into a process of cross-country synthesis that will, in turn, \nfeed into the IAIS processes of standard setting, guidance, and training. \n4.  In-Country Implementation \n11.  To optimize in-country implementation, completed country assessments should provide \nthe following platforms for engagement with country stakeholders:2 \n(i)  the process of undertaking the country assessment must be as participatory as \npossible, thus building credibility with country counterparts and preparing the \nground for change, the process being as important as the report; \n(ii)  a set of recommendations for policy and regulatory change and support to the \ninsurance supervisor; \n(iii)  the general review of the regulatory and supervisory context should provide a \nbasis for engagement between the IAIS and the country supervisor; and \n(iv)  sufficient analysis of the actual and potential market for microinsurance (including, \nwhere relevant, assessments of current pilots or products offered) so as to be \nuseful to market players. (This is not a core focus of the country assessments, \nbut  experience  has  shown  that  decision-makers  are  unlikely  to  take  an \nassessment seriously unless it contains factual information that illustrates market \ndynamics, demand and opportunities.) \n                                                \n2  Country stakeholders include public and private actors as well as development partners who have an interest in the \nareas of microinsurance and financial sector development more generally. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "RR3", "Company": "Licenced User", "CreationDate": "D:20100503143245+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 9.0 for Word", "ModDate": "D:20100512110220+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 9.0", "SourceModified": "D:20100503063135", "Title": "Doc number"}}
