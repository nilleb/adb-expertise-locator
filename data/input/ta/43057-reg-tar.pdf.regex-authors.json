Over the last two decades, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promoted improved \nawareness of climate change and its impacts on development in the Asia and Pacific region. \nUnder ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 20201) ADB will follow three \ncomplementary strategic agendas: inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and \nregional integration. ADB is strengthening its operational emphasis on the environment under \nStrategy 2020, with particular focus on improving energy efficiency, expanding the use of clean \nenergy sources, improving disaster risk management, modernizing public transport systems, \nincreasing crop resilience, and arresting deforestation. This reinforces its commitment to help \ncountries mitigate and adapt to climate change. Traditionally, ADB\u2019s main instruments have \nconsisted of loans, technical assistance, grants, advice, and knowledge products. \n \n2.  On 6 May 2008, ADB established the Climate Change Fund (CCF)2 to facilitate greater \ninvestment in developing member countries (DMCs) to address the causes and consequences \nof climate change effectively. The CCF will be a key mechanism to pool resources within ADB to \naddress climate change through (i) technical assistance (TA), and (ii) grant components of \ninvestment projects. The implementation guidelines for the CCF outline activities that may \nqualify for CCF support. These include the development of knowledge products and services \nrelated to climate change; and facilitating knowledge management activities, including regional \nconferences and workshops.  \n \n3.  Drawing on experience gained during short-term collaborative projects with the Asia-\nPacific  Broadcasting  Union  (ABU),3  this  TA  will  build  the  capacity  of  television  and  radio \nbroadcasters from the Asia and Pacific region; and will use this capacity to raise the knowledge \nlevel about climate change among national media, policy makers, and the public. With the far-\nreaching  influence  of  broadcast  media,  concrete  examples  of  adaptation  and  mitigation \nmeasures will be communicated to a broad audience across Asia and the Pacific, enabling a \ngreater understanding of regional climate change challenges and opportunities. An indirect \nbenefit for ADB would be enhanced brand credibility through stories that demonstrate ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to fighting climate change. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, countries in Asia and the \nPacific will experience climate-induced variation\u2014causing severe impacts on agriculture and \nfood security, coastal populations, marine ecosystems, human health, and more. Without any \nfurther increase in global carbon emissions, crop yields in Asia are predicted to fall up to 10% \nby  2020,  causing  an  additional  49  million  people  to  be  vulnerable  to  hunger.4  Millions  of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2   The Climate Change Fund was established by ADB with additional funds from other donors. \n3  ABU is a nonprofit, nongovernment, professional association of broadcasting organizations, formed in 1964 to \nfacilitate the development of broadcasting in the Asia-Pacific region and to organize cooperative activities among its \nmembers. It currently has more than 200 members in 52 countries. More than 120 are television broadcasters; of \nthese, 80 also operate radio stations. The potential audience of its members is about 3 billion people. ABU is the \nsecond largest of the world's eight broadcasting unions, but it covers the largest geographic area. Members must \nbe national broadcasting services in Asia and the Pacific, but there are associate members in other parts of the \nworld. Aside from operating a daily satellite TV news exchange (Asiavision), ABU\u2019s activities include coproduction \nand exchange of programs among its members; negotiation and organization of coverage of events; consultancy \nservices; organizing seminars, workshops, and symposia; advising and representing members on copyright issues; \nand competitions for radio and TV programs. \n4 Cruz, R.V., H.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 469\u2013506.  ", "2 \nresidents of coastal areas in Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, and all Pacific islands will be \naffected by rising sea levels and more frequent and severe weather events. To respond to these \nchallenges,  massive  concerted  action  from  public,  private,  and  civil  society  actors  will  be \nneeded, especially to address the needs of low-income populations. \n \n5.   The poor are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change because of their high \ndependence  on  natural  resources,  and  limited  livelihood  and  mobility  options.  These \ncommunities are highly sensitive to changes in the natural environment and are concerned \nabout climate change impacts in their everyday lives. However, they do not often have access \nto policy makers involved in defining responses to climate change or to information about \nresponses in other similar locations. \n  \n6.   Mass media has long been recognized as a potent tool for shaping public opinion and \ncatalyzing change. In the development context, mass media can be an effective catalyst in \nchanging policy and empowering target audiences with new knowledge and skill sets to address \nchallenges. ADB investments support climate proofing of infrastructure, risk reduction, and \ndisaster preparedness throughout Asia and the Pacific. This produces a wealth of technical \nknowledge, but this often fails to reach policy makers or public audiences. \n \n7.  Informed and well-equipped national broadcasters can help to drive dialogue about \nclimate change to be more responsive to the needs of the most vulnerable populations in Asia \nand the Pacific. Innovative multimedia approaches can help ensure that good practices and \nlessons  resulting  from  the  ADB  Climate  Change  Program  and  other  related  projects  and \nprograms reach broader audiences. Popular television and radio media outlets can leverage \ntechnical  research,  planning  documents,  and  other  traditional  ADB  outputs  to  increase \nawareness  about  the  realities of climate change. The Climate Impacts and Responses: A \nMultimedia  Campaign  Project  can  empower  journalists  to  focus  on  the  impacts  and \nopportunities for responding to climate change in their countries, and increase the accountability \nof institutions responding to the global climate change.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA will help raise the profile of successful results of ADB\u2019s Climate Change Program \nto a large target audience across Asia and the Pacific. This will enable ADB to replicate and \nscale up successful activities. The impact will be a heightened level of discourse in mainstream \nmedia on climate-related risks and adaptation measures in DMCs, an increased number of \njournalists  covering  climate-related  issues  in  DMCs,  and  further  dissemination  of  climate \nchange-related information\u2014in terms of ongoing responses and good practices to the public \nand policy makers. This will be measured by the number of stories about climate change on \nABU affiliate stations and will be tracked by ABU. \n \n9.  This TA will disseminate innovative climate change policies, tools, pilot projects and \nlessons learned across ADB developing member countries, including vulnerable communities, \npolicy makers, and governments, civil society organizations and private sector entities facing \nsimilar challenges from climate shocks. It will build capacity of an influential network of national-\nlevel broadcast journalists who are well positioned to promote proactive responses to climate \nthreats. Target countries may include: Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, \nIndonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand \nand Viet Nam. This will be achieved through multimedia public outreach technical assistance \nabout climate change risks and responsive activities launched by ADB through ABU and by \nDMC journalists; and prioritization of climate change for broadcasters in Asia and the Pacific by \nthe ABU General Assembly. Climate change knowledge will be increased among ABU partners \n ", "3 \nvia ADB and ABU joint workshops. Progress on these activities will be tracked by ADB and ABU \nthrough broadcast statistics, capacity surveys, and the minutes of ABU General Assembly \nmeeting (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA adopts a two-pronged approach to achieving the above impact and outcome:  \n(i)  a series of capacity-building activities for broadcasters in Asia and the Pacific; \nand  \n(ii)  the production, distribution, and guaranteed broadcast of short video and radio \nnews  feature  items  (NFIs)  on  various  impacts  of  climate  change  and \ncorresponding mitigation and adaptation responses being instituted by ADB. \n \n1.  Component 1: Capacity Building Workshops \n \n11.  Capacity-building  workshops  will  be  organized  by  ABU.  Experienced  mid-career \nbroadcast  journalists  will  be  invited,  and  24  participants  will  be  selected  based  on  their \nprofessional qualifications. Apart from providing advanced training in journalism and production \ntechniques, the workshops will familiarize participants with various aspects of climate change, \nas well as mitigation and adaptation efforts such as initiatives on energy efficiency, sustainable \ntransportation, renewable energy, and climate proofing\u2014including ADB programs supporting \nthese efforts. Linkages between disaster risk management and climate change adaptation will \nalso be highlighted. The syllabus of the workshop programs will be formulated as a collaborative \neffort between ADB and ABU. In consultation with climate change experts from ADB, the \nbroadcasters will identify stories they can work on, and the key messages that ADB wants to \nconvey. The details for the proposed workshops are as follows: \n \n(i)  Workshop 1. Water \u2013 Disaster Risk and Resource Management. Participants: \n6 broadcasters. Venue: New Delhi. \n(ii)  Workshop  2.  Vulnerability,  Adaptation,  and  Mitigation  in  Megacities. \nParticipants: 6 broadcasters. Venue: Bangkok. \n(iii)  Workshop 3. PRC: Climate Maker, Climate Taker. This coproduction workshop \nwill bring together twelve PRC broadcast journalists to cover challenges and \nopportunities  related  to  scaling  up  energy  efficiency  and  internal  migration \ncaused by climate impacts. Venue: Beijing. \n(iv)  Workshop 4. The Asia Clean Energy Forum. This 4-day forum will draw climate \nchange and clean energy decision makers and technical experts from around the \nAsia and Pacific region. Building on last year\u2019s event\u2014which drew more than \n500 participants from 40 countries\u2014the forum will be the premier Asian clean \nenergy and climate change policy dialogue in advance of the United Nations \nFramework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  negotiations  in  Copenhagen  in \nDecember 2009. This year\u2019s event will feature a 1.5-day high-level forum for \npolicy  makers.  Participants:  broadcasters  from  Asia  and  the  Pacific  DMCs. \nVenue: Manila. \n \n2.  Component 2: Production and Distribution \n \n12.  The  workshops  will  generate  the  production  and  subsequent  national  television \nbroadcast of more than 100 original, short (3-minute) video NFIs. Location filming will take place \nafter the workshops, throughout 2009. ABU requires that workshop participants guarantee the \nbroadcast of the eight NFIs (two following each workshop) that each participating journalist will \nbe asked to produce. ABU and staff from ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations (DER) will \nwork with broadcasters during their production process to help ensure quality control. In addition \nto securing advance broadcaster commitments to air the news features, ABU will market the \n ", "4 \nNFIs to its other member broadcasters across Asia and the Pacific. Every quarter, the three \nbest news features will be promoted and distributed by ABU to international and regional \ntelevision networks such as CNN World Report and Channel NewsAsia. \n \n13.  In June 2009, ABU will organize live television coverage and satellite feeds of stories \nand interviews from the High Level Dialogue on Climate Change and subsequently the Clean \nEnergy Forum, at ADB headquarters. All ABU members around the Asia and Pacific region will \nbe able to access these short news items and interviews. ABU will distribute the material \nimmediately following the daily Eurovision TV (European Broadcasting Union) and Asiavision \n(ABU) satellite news exchanges on the same satellite coordinates in order to maximize pickup \nby these members (who will automatically record the feed). The feed will also be promoted to \nABU members. \n \n14.  To increase the awareness of communities without access to television\u2014population \ngroups normally comprised of the most vulnerable, poorest of the poor, and climate change \nmigrants\u2014ABU  will  undertake  the  Climate  Change  Radio  Initiative.  ABU  will  invite  radio \nmembers from targeted countries to the New Delhi workshop, where they will participate in key \nsessions with television participants, before breaking off for dedicated sessions with ABU\u2019s \nsenior  executive  for  radio.  In  these  sessions,  radio  participants  will  focus  on  their  output \nfollowing the workshop; and brainstorm on topics for the annual ABU Radio Climate Change \nInitiative, which galvanizes ABU members to produce stories on the topic in June of each year. \nABU will appoint an executive producer from a participating broadcaster to develop a story \ntemplate that will be shared with all 84 ABU radio members, to be used to produce a story for \nthe June deadline. \n \n15.   For more in-depth and innovative treatment of climate change, ABU will offer various \nproduction  awards  for  radio  and  television\u2014grants  to  produce  longer  (10\u201326  minute) \ndocumentaries, and grants for 30\u201360 second public service announcements (PSAs). Television \nproduction grants will be provided for up to eight NFIs, two documentaries, and two PSAs. For \nradio, grants will be provided for up to five news features, two documentaries, and two PSAs. \n \n16.  In October 2009, an ADB\u2013ABU prize for climate change reporting will be awarded at \nABU\u2019s General Assembly to the best radio and television production broadcast of the year. \nSubmissions for news features, documentaries, and/or PSAs will be requested from all ABU \nbroadcasters to encourage additional output on the issue. \n \n17.  The proposed TA contains innovative and cutting-edge technological features\u2014the use \nof  digital  media  technology  and  the  internet\u2014as  well  as  the  potential  for  replication  and \nscalability in addressing development issues, including but not limited to climate change. Apart \nfrom the direct benefits, this TA could be seen as a pilot project that could form the nucleus of a \nbroader ADB communications strategy on climate change\u2014one which would also incorporate \nprint media, media outreach, advocacy, and grassroots communication systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cost estimate of the TA is $721, 000. ADB will finance the amount of $450,000 on a \ngrant basis from the CCF. ABU will finance the remaining amount of $271,000. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be implemented in collaboration \nwith ABU as per the detailed arrangements specified in the Letter of Agreement (LOA) executed \nbetween ADB and ABU. No activity, financed by ADB shall be commenced in the territory of any \nparticipating developing country unless a no objection letter is obtained, in writing, from the \n ", "5 \ngovernment of that participating developing country. A brief account of ABU's contributions is \nprovided in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook5. Project supervision and oversight will be the \nresponsibility of ADB\u2019s DER.  \n \n20.  ABU will provide its resource persons for capacity building of video and radio production \ntechniques of the participating journalists. The honoraria and travel expenses of these resource \npersons, as well as those of the participating journalists, will be funded from the TA. There will \nbe no procurement or engagement of consultants by ADB. DER and RSDD staff, the latter led \nby  the  Climate  Change  Coordination  Unit,  will  collaborate  with  ABU  resource  persons  in \nformulating the syllabus of the workshop programs. Coordination and implementation of the \nworkshops and related activities will be undertaken by ABU. The content and general style of \nthe NFIs will be developed by participating journalists, with advice and guidance from DER and \nRSDD staff and climate change experts and ABU\u2019s technical resource staff. A coordination \nnetwork among DER, RSDD, staff from regional missions, ADB climate change consultants, and \nABU  will  be  established  to  help  the  participating  journalists  pursue  their  stories  after  the \nworkshops and ensure high-quality NFIs. \n \n21.  TA progress will be measured, as stipulated in the design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1), in large part by the change in capacity in the selected broadcast journalists. \nADB\u2019s DER and RSDD will work together to design pre- and post-participation survey tools to \ndetermine changes in the level of journalists\u2019 knowledge of climate change. Further, ADB and \nABU-trained journalists will \u201cecho back\u201d to home stations via a presentation to colleagues about \nclimate change. Records of these presentations and a list of attendees and recipients will be \nprovided to ABU and ADB by the journalists. Finally, ABU will place climate change on the \nagenda of its General Assembly and will report to ADB on progress of the resulting dialogue. \n \n22.  ABU will broadcast more than 100 new media stories developed as part of the TA via \nradio and television. It will also track the distribution of the NFIs, PSAs, documentaries, and \nradio stories through its member stations and existing mechanisms. \n \nE.  Project Timeline \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period starting in February 2009 and \nending in August 2010.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Climate Impacts and Responses: A Multimedia Campaign Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.     \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2008.

This will include (i) coordinating the participation \nof qualified broadcast participants; (ii) identifying qualified trainers; (iii) planning and conducting \ntraining workshops on the production of news feature stories on climate change using advanced \njournalism and production techniques; (iv) providing pre-production and post-production support \nto participating broadcasters; (v) marketing and distributing news features to broadcasters in \nAsia and the Pacific; (vi) securing agreements with broadcasters guaranteeing airtime for the \nNFIs; (vii) negotiating usage agreements with broadcasters, e.g., the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) having shared copyright of all video footage, etc.; (viii) appointing an executive producer \nfor program compilation and satellite feeds (the latter at the 2009 Asia Clean Energy Forum); \n(ix) arranging satellite feeds from the Asia Clean Energy Forum; (x) ensuring regular satellite \ndistribution  of  climate  change  news  features  via  ABU\u2019s  Media  Awareness  Exchange; \n(xi) marketing selected NFIs to top-tier broadcasters such as CNN World Report and Channel \nNewsAsia; (xii) organizing various production awards, grants, and prizes to encourage longer \ndocumentaries,  public  service  announcements,  and  in-depth  reporting;  and  (xiii)  compiling \nusage  reports  (when  possible).  Further,  to  increase  capacity  for  effective  climate  change \njournalism in Asia and the Pacific, ABU will secure commitments from participating broadcasters \nto hold \u201cecho seminars\u201d at their parent broadcast stations, providing a forum for them to share \nlessons from the workshops. \n \n2.  ABU will also work for the adoption of a broadcaster agreement applicable throughout \nAsia and the Pacific on climate change broadcasts. To this end, ABU will (i) ensure that the \nADB\u2013ABU Climate Change Initiative is featured as one of the main items on the 2009 ABU \nGeneral Assembly agenda; (ii) establish a working group to develop a strategy to focus the \nattention of broadcasters in Asia and the Pacific on  climate change issue; (iii) work with other \nbroadcasters to draft a climate change broadcast policy recommendation for approval by ABU\u2019s \nGeneral Assembly, to be adopted (assuming it is approved) at ABU\u2019s 2009 General Assembly; \nand (iv) follow up on the approved policy by securing broadcast partner commitments. \n \n3.  In  addition  to  these  activities,  ABU will coordinate a climate change media blitz in \nconjunction with the 2009 ABU General Assembly meeting. To this end, ABU, in coordination \nwith ADB, will (i) develop a comprehensive \u201cclimate change tool kit\u201d for broadcasters that will \ninclude news feature scripts and footage, ADB knowledge products, and video interviews with \nADB  climate  change  specialists;  (ii)  secure  1  week\u2019s  commitment  from  ABU  members  to \nbroadcast on climate change in conjunction with the ABU General Assembly; and (iii) ensure \nsatellite distribution of new climate change programming to all ABU members. \n \n4.  Finally, ABU will ensure that high-resolution duplicates of the footage resulting from the \nfilming of NFIs by broadcasters participating in the capacity-building workshops will be provided \nto ADB for its own use. This will significantly enhance ADB\u2019s video library stock, enabling more \ncomprehensive in-house video and multimedia production for various climate change issues. \n \n  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090126091958+08'00'", "Author": "gln", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "climate change, impacts and responses, climate change fund, multimedia campaign project, regional capacity development technical assistance, adb r-cdta, adb project 43057, reta 43057, adb technical assistance", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090128134204+08'00'", "Title": "Climate Impacts and Responses: A Multimedia Campaign Project (Financed by the Climate Change Fund)"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \nABU  \u2013  Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union \nADB   \u2013  Asian Development Bank \nCCF  \u2013  Climate Change Fund \nDER  \u2013  Department of External Relations \nDMC  \u2013  developing member country \nNFI   \u2013  news feature item \nPRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \nPSA  \u2013  public service announcement \nRSDD  \u2013  Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nTA   \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Regional capacity development technical assistance (R-CDTA) \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Multisector (agriculture and natural resources; energy; health, \nnutrition, and social protection) \nSubsectors  \u2013  Water resource management; energy sector development; social \nprotection \nThemes  \u2013  Environmental sustainability, capacity development \nSubthemes  \u2013  Global and regional transboundary environmental concerns and \nissues, institutional development \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManaging Director General  R.
