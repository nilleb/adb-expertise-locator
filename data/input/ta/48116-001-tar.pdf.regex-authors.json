INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2012, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) asked the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nSustainable  and  Climate-Resilient  Land  Management  in  the  Western  Regions.1 The  TA, \nfinanced by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), will continue to support government efforts \nto  strengthen  the  PRC\u2013GEF  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosystems  by \nexpanding the regional scope and upscaling sustainable land management (SLM) investments \nin selected provinces and autonomous regions. In February 2014, an ADB mission visited the \nPRC and reached an understanding with the government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, \ncost  estimates,  financing  plan,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  implementation \narrangements, including TA delegation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  SLM and building resilience to climate change remain a priority for the provinces and \nautonomous regions in the western regions of the PRC, home to approximately 75% of the \nPRC\u2019s rural poor. As part of its development strategy, a number of domestic programs have \nbeen implemented over last 20 years to introduce traditional larger scale land degradation \ncontrol measures for selected areas in the western regions. In 2002, to get more exposure to \ninnovative  practices  and  promote  international  cooperation,  the  government  formalized  the \nPRC\u2013GEF partnership as a long-term cooperation agreement between the PRC, GEF, ADB, the \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  the  World  bank,  and  other  development \npartners. The partnership has successfully promoted and introduced new concepts in SLM such \nas integrated ecosystem management, payment for ecosystem services, and public\u2013private \npartnerships.  Provincial  strategies  and  action  plans  were  mainstreamed  into  the  local \ndevelopment planning to ensure investment and financial flows for SLM and livelihood activities. \nSLM practices applied in pilots and investment programs include reforestation, greenhouses for \nvegetable production, soil erosion control measures, mulching, grazing management, irrigation \ncontrol, and other development activities for income generation and livelihood improvement. \nCapacity development and knowledge management supported the activities. Achievements and \nlessons learned, including the need for further innovation and a stronger support for initiatives \nby local governments, are documented in national and international publications.2 \n \n3.  Since the establishment of the partnership in 2002, the State Forestry Administration \n(SFA) has taken the lead in the promotion and coordination of TA and investment projects under \nthe PRC\u2013GEF partnership. ADB\u2019s grant and TA projects for the SFA, with GEF cofinancing, \nfocused  on  capacity  development,  institutional  strengthening,  and  pilot  testing  of  new \ntechnologies for SLM in selected western provinces and autonomous regions.3 In parallel, ADB-\nfinanced investment projects were prepared and implemented in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 May 2014. \n2  For example, ADB. 2009.

Total investment by all partners for \nTA and grant projects under the partnership is about $800 million. \n \n4.  In 2012, ADB provided policy and advisory TA to help develop a new 10-year SLM \nstrategy for the PRC\u2013GEF partnership.4 Endorsed by the national steering committee, this new \nand broader-reaching strategy (i) focuses on replicating and upscaling achievements of the \npartnership, with a strong emphasis on investments by local governments and communities; (ii) \ntargets capacity development and its linkage to demonstration and investment activities; (iii) \nadopts a broader financial resource mobilization strategy, including innovative mechanisms like \neco-compensation programs; and (iv) has a stronger link with the PRC\u2019s National Action Plan \nfor the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the objectives of the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification.5  \n \n5.  The proposed TA will support the SFA with its increased responsibilities to coordinate \nthe implementation of the new strategy for regional expansion and upscaling of investment \nprograms under the PRC\u2013GEF partnership. Through its continued engagement in and support \nfor  the  partnership,  ADB  aims  to  support  the  PRC\u2019s  sustainable  development  agenda,  as \npresented during the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of \nChina.  Climate  change  and  environmental  sustainability  are  key  considerations,  including \ngreater preparedness for extreme weather events and conservation of natural resources. The \nTA is in line with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 20206 which calls for expanding efforts in \nthe agriculture and natural resources sector to support inclusive growth. It is also in line with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u201320157 for  the  PRC  in  supporting  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be degraded lands restored and local livelihood improved in the project \nareas in western PRC. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of the PRC government to \nintroduce innovations in sustainable and climate-resilient land management. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will support the SFA in strengthening its capacity for effective implementation of \nthe new strategy, as prepared under ADB\u2019s TA for the Integrated Strategy for Sustainable Land \nManagement in Dryland Ecosystems (footnote 4). Support for implementation of the strategy \nincludes  introducing  innovations  in  sustainable  and  climate-resilient  land  management  and \nupscaling of activities in three provinces and one autonomous region that participated in the first \nphase of the PRC\u2013GEF partnership (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Gansu, Qinghai, and \nShaanxi provinces); and strengthening the enabling environment for SLM in two new provinces \n(Guizhou and Sichuan), which are added to expand the geographic scope of the partnership. \nThe project has four outputs, which are based on the GEF focal area outcomes. \n \n8.  Output  1:  Resilience  of  landscape  ecosystems  to  climate  change  improved. \nMobilization of investments in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and Gansu, Qinghai, and \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012.

The  second  component  will  strengthen  sustainable  forest \nmanagement on about 442,200 ha of land in Qinghai, leading to an estimated total system \ncarbon stock10 increase of 57,600 tons of carbon equivalent by 2023 in the project area. The \nGEF incremental support will (i) promote tree-planting for carbon sequestration in forested areas \nin Qinghai, (ii) support two investment projects focusing on sustainable forestry management in \nQinghai, and (iii) introduce best practices to improve plant survival rates. \n \n9.  Output 2: Management of degraded lands to support rural livelihoods and green \ndevelopment improved. Sixteen SLM sites will be set up to demonstrate innovative practices \nto improve management of degraded forests, grassland, and farmland in project areas. The \noutput  will  promote  sustainable  alternative  climate-resilient  livelihoods  for  communities  in \naffected areas, and support demonstration of green development.11 The first component will \nsupport SLM at SLM sites covering around 25,000 ha of land supporting sustainable livelihood \nsystems for over 2,000 residents in project areas. GEF financing will support (i) identification \nand  testing  of  sustainable  livelihoods  related  to  innovative  SLM  practices,  multifunctional \ncommunity forestry, and grassland development; (ii) development of ecological industries in \nGuizhou  and  Sichuan;  (iii)  improvement  of  ecological  compensation  standards  of  land \nrestoration  and  livelihood  improvement  to  support  eco-compensation  innovation  sites  and \nupscaling in Gansu and Shaanxi; and (iv) training in SLM and sustainable livelihoods through \nfarmer  field  schools  to  scale  up  SLM  activities  in  Guizhou  and  Sichuan.12 The  second \ncomponent  will  enhance  community  awareness  of  climate  change  impacts  to  reduce \nvulnerability and carbon emissions from land management and production models at  SLM \ninnovation  sites  with  about  3,000  residents.  GEF  financing  will  support  development  of \nguidelines on climate-resilient SLM measures and reduction of carbon emissions, and training \nto improve local communities\u2019 understanding of climate resilience. The third component will \nincrease  productivity  of  agro-ecological  and  forest  landscapes  on  over  30,000  ha  of  land \nthrough green development in Guizhou and Sichuan provinces. GEF financing will support (i) \ndevelopment of green products and marketing in four communities; and (ii) regional green \ndevelopment with eco-agriculture, ecotourism, and clean energy. \n \n10.  Output 3: Enabling environment and capacity for scaling up of SLM in Guizhou \nand Sichuan provinces enhanced. Technical regulations and SLM policies will be put in place \nfor Guizhou and Sichuan provinces.13 The first component will strengthen the institutional and \nregulatory framework, including SLM policies, in Guizhou and Sichuan provinces. This will \nsupport  improvements  in  institutional  frameworks  and  investment  policies  for  cross-sector \n                                                \n8  Output 1 contributes to GEF focal area outcome 3.3: increased investments in integrated landscape management. \n9  Agro-ecosystems  encompass  intensive  and  extensive  crop-based,  livestock-based,  and  mixed  systems,  as \nincluded in the new GEF-6 land degradation focal area, complementing forest ecosystems. \n10 The quantity of carbon contained in a \u201cpool\u201d, meaning a reservoir or system which has the capacity to accumulate \nor release carbon.

The  second  component  will  enhance  technical  SLM  capacity  for  2,000  local \nbeneficiaries in Guizhou and Sichuan provinces. The GEF incremental support will focus on \ndeveloping capacity of the two new provinces in monitoring and assessing SLM impacts. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Project  management  supported.  Overall  support  will  be  provided  for \nimplementing the project activities specified for each output and thereby ensure that project \noutcomes are delivered on time and with the expected quality. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $23,300,776 equivalent, of which $5,250,776 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the GEF and administered by ADB.14 The government will \nprovide $3,150,000 equivalent in cash. The balance will be in-kind support by the government in \nthe form of field testing, meeting venues, workshops, travel, per diem, reports, staff time, office \nfacilities,  and  other  in-kind  contributions,  including  all  local  taxes,  in  line  with  the  GEF \ncofinancing requirements, the TA framework agreement between the government and ADB, and \nthe memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Enhanced Partnership on TA Delegation to \nthe executing agency. The counterpart funds will be administered by the government. Cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. A financing agreement will be prepared in \naccordance with the MOU between ADB and the GEF Secretariat on Direct Access to GEF \nResources dated 4 July 2004. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented from 1 February 2015 to 31 January 2018. The SFA will be \nthe executing agency. There will be six implementing agencies: the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion;  and  Gansu,  Guizhou,  Qinghai,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces.  The  existing \ninstitutional and organizational arrangement under the PRC\u2013GEF partnership will continue. The \nnational  steering  committee  includes  representatives  from  the  national  legislative  and \nstakeholder ministries and agencies. The central project management office (CPMO) at the SFA \nwill manage the TA implementation. Provincial project coordination offices and provincial project \nmanagement offices (PPMOs) have been set up for each implementing agency, headed by the \nvice-governor or chairperson in charge of the agriculture sector. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  as  a  delegated  TA.  The  SFA  will  be  responsible  for \norganizing and supervising procurement (the procurement plan is in supplementary appendix A), \nand will sign the contracts with contractors and suppliers.15 ADB-financed procurement will be \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The ownership of purchased goods and services will be transferred to the SFA upon TA \ncompletion.  The  SFA  will  be  supported  by  CPMO  staff,  a  consulting  firm,  and  individual \nconsultants to provide technical support for implementation of the activities in the project areas. \nAll  consultant  engagements  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  2009  MOU  on  the \nEnhanced Partnership on TA Delegation to the executing agency. The SFA will be responsible \nfor the selection of consultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). ADB will sign the contracts with the consultants. A consulting firm, \nproviding international (18 person-months) and national consultants (105 person-months), will \nbe recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection at a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Twelve \nnational individual consultants (334 person-months) will be engaged to support the project \n                                                \n14 Grant funding of $5,250,776 was obtained from the GEF on 2 June 2014. Upon the request of the PRC \ngovernment, the scope of activities to be financed by the grant was increased from the initial project identification. \n15 Excluding for procurement under consulting services contracts. \n ", "5 \nmanagement offices on day-to-day implementation of the TA, using the individual consultant \nselection  method.  This  method  is  considered  appropriate  and  cost-effective  as  (i)  the \norganization structure is already established for the PRC\u2013GEF partnership, and (ii) local experts \nare required in all six provinces. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Except for consulting services, ADB will disburse the proceeds of the GEF grant to the \ngovernment in accordance with the MOU between ADB and the GEF Secretariat. For the \nproceeds of the GEF grant, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will establish an imprest account at a \nbank acceptable to ADB. The account will be managed and replenished in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). The initial and \nadditional  advances  to  be  deposited  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  project \nexpenditures for the forthcoming 6 months of implementation. The imprest account ceiling will \nbe 10% of the TA amount. MOF will disburse proceeds of the GEF grant to the executing and \nimplementing  agencies in  line  with  the  consolidated  annual  work  and financial  plans. The \nstatement of expenditures procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures financed \nby the GEF grant, and for replenishing and liquidating advances that were deposited to the \nimprest account. Any individual payment to be reimbursed under the statement of expenditures \nprocedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. \n \n16.  For  withdrawal  of  the  grant,  the  SFA  will  submit  to  ADB  the  original  withdrawal \napplication, signed by authorized representatives of MOF and the SFA; summary sheet; and \ncopies of supporting documents. The SFA will maintain separate accounts for the GEF grant \nand have these accounts audited on an annual basis by an external auditor acceptable to ADB. \nWithin 6 months after the end of the fiscal year, the SFA will submit to ADB and MOF a \nconsolidated audit report covering the CPMO and the six PPMOs. The SFA will include in the \nTA progress report the status of the GEF grant utilization during the report period and utilization, \ncumulative  from  the  start  of  implementation.  The  SFA  will  retain  the  original  supporting \ndocuments for expenditures under the TA for at least 2 years after TA completion, and make \nthese documents available to ADB upon request within the indicated TA retention period. \nE.  Governance \n17.  The procurement capacity assessment indicates that overall risk is considered low. The \nSFA and most implementing agencies have substantial experience with implementing ADB-\nadministered  GEF  grants.  Moreover,  monitoring  and  internal  controls  for  procurement  are \ngenerally in place. The financial management assessment indicates that the overall risk is low. \nThe  SFA  has  administered  and  implemented  two  similar  GEF  grants,  and  has  significant \nexperience. The SFA, in cooperation with MOF, meets ADB\u2019s requirements in the area of fund \nflow arrangements, experienced finance staff, accounting policies and procedures, internal and \nexternal auditing, reporting and monitoring, and information systems. The TA will continue to \nprovide additional assistance and training on ADB procedures and requirements for financial \nmanagement, procurement, disbursement, and monitoring and evaluation, as necessary. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \ngovernment; the executing and implementing agencies were informed that audit reports will be \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.
