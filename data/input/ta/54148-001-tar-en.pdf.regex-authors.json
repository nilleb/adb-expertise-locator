INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of a \nscalable pipeline of infrastructure projects that  can  attract  private  sector  investments  and \ngenerate efficiency gains through (i) the screening of new and existing projects in the deal \npipelines developed by the developing member country (DMC)  governments and their  public \nsector agencies (PSAs);1 and (ii) the provision of capacity building-related  assistance,  including \nknowledge sharing and training events in the Central and West Asia (CWA) region.2 The TA will \nalso help develop credible concepts for the (i) introduction and/or strengthening of sustainable \nand  integrated  financing  solutions,  and  (ii)  deployment  of  efficient  and  responsive  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) transaction support to augment public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and \nprivate sector participation (PSP)3 for the delivery of infrastructure projects in the CWA region.4  \n \n2.  The  TA  responds  directly  to  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,5 which  identifies  private  sector \noperations, including PPPs, and strengthening of ADB\u2019s knowledge services as key operational \npriorities. The TA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan \n2012\u20132020,6 which  requires  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  to  assume  a  leadership  role  in \nadvocating PPPs within DMCs. 7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Rising financing needs and gaps. Central Asia needs to invest an average of $33 billion \nannually in infrastructure until 2030 to maintain its growth momentum and tackle poverty,8 \nexcluding the cost of responding to climate change. PSP, including PPPs, are considered to be \nan important modality for attracting private investment in infrastructure and enhancing efficiency \nof infrastructure services. \n \n4.  Despite the importance of PSP projects and PPPs, PSAs lack the necessary capacity and \nexperience to identify, structure and procure credible and bankable PSP projects and PPPs and \nscale up PSP for the provision of infrastructure services. Most PSP and PPP pipelines are \ndeveloped solely with reference to the DMC priority infrastructure needs and do not assess the \nvalue added by the PSP and PPP modalities, the potential market risk appetite, and the projects\u2019 \nultimate bankability and scalability. \n \n \n1  These include central and local governments, government agencies (including subsovereign and government-owned \nentities), and other entities eligible to receive assistance from the Asian Development Bank. \n2  The CWA region includes Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.  \n3  Examples include PPPs (including partnerships involving management and operating contracts, concessional \ndesign\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate\u2013maintain  contracts,  and  partial  divestitures)  or  privatizations  (full  or  partial \ndivestitures). Projects and developments that do not involve a key public sector counterparty will not be supported \nby the TA. \n4  Projects include energy infrastructure (such as power stations, transmission and distribution lines, and substations); \ntransport infrastructure (such as ports, airports, railways, roads, and bridges); urban development infrastructure (such \nas water and waste management projects); agricultural infrastructure; and social infrastructure (such as healthcare \nor education projects). \n5  ADB. 2018.

Data on Afghanistan and Pakistan are excluded from the \ncost estimate (they are included in the infrastructure needs estimates for South Asia). \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Insufficient access to private sector resources. Historically, sovereign borrowing has \nbeen the major source of financing for infrastructure in the CWA region. Given the constrained \nfiscal budgets, which will be further impacted by the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic,9 there is a need to significantly increase the access by potential projects to a full range \nof private sector funding sources, including long-term institutional investors (e.g., pension funds \nand  insurance  companies)  and  commercial  banks.  The  circumstances  necessitate  the \ndevelopment and implementation of integrated financing solutions to augment PSP and PPP \nprojects for sustainable infrastructure delivery. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) sustainability of private sector investments \nin infrastructure projects in ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) DMCs improved; \n(ii) DMCs\u2019 capacity to plan, develop, and sustainably finance infrastructure using PSP and PPP \nmodalities increased; and (iii) ADB\u2019s knowledge services strengthened (footnote 5). The TA will \nhave the following outcome: CWRD DMCs\u2019 capacity in identification, preparation and financial \nsupport of sustainable and gender sensitive infrastructure PSP projects and PPPs improved. 10  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  The TA will have three key outputs. While the largest output and fund allocation will be for \noutput 2, outputs 1 and 3 are designed to feed into output 2 and ensure sustainability and \ncontinuity when the TA is completed. \n \n8.  Output  1:  Private  sector  participation  projects  and  public-private  partnerships \nidentified and initially screened. The TA will help identify and develop project screening reports \n(PSRs) for at least 6 scalable pilot infrastructure projects, in various sectors and DMCs in CWA. \nThe project screening process will involve the relevant resident missions and sector divisions of \nADB\u2019s  CWRD,  Office  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  (OPPP),  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment (PSOD), sector and thematic groups, and other ADB departments, thereby bringing \ntogether the knowledge and expertise across ADB and accelerating the One ADB approach in \nthe CWA region. \n \n9.  The project screening process will comprise a high-level assessment with the objective of \ndetermining if the project can be appropriately structured with PSP; is potentially economically \nand financially viable and fiscally responsible (i.e., commercial revenues and other operational \ncash flows to the project are likely to cover costs, including debt service obligations). The project \nscreening  process  will  also  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  capacity  and \nresources and its willingness to pay for or subsidize the services, if necessary. The project \nscreening process will examine relevant gender and social inclusion issues and identify potential \ngender-responsive, socially inclusive design features. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Private  sector  participation  projects  and  public-private  partnerships \nfinancing solutions and transaction support developed. The PSRs resulting from this process \n \n9  The TA is not designed solely for projects that address the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is anticipated that some \ntransactions under the TA will be in the health sector or related to other sectors affected by the COVID-19 crisis. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nwill clarify the basis for advocating the most appropriate (i) gender-responsive, socially inclusive, \nsustainable, and innovative private sector financing solutions; and (ii) responses that can be \ndeployed by ADB through its transaction support products.11 The TA will assist in the development \nof at least 2 credible and efficient concepts for potential ADB PSP and PPP transaction support \nfor the introduction of sustainable, innovative, and fiscally responsible private sector financing \nsolutions and promotion of gender equality in all PSP and PPP projects developed with the \nsupport of the TA. \n \n11.  Output 3: Transaction-focused private sector participation projects and public-\nprivate partnerships knowledge sharing, training and capacity building activities carried \nout. The TA will support at least two regional consultation events with PPP authorities, relevant \nPSAs involved in PSP and PPP work in the CWA region, and ADB project teams; the objective \nwill be to maximize responsiveness of the TA project to the needs and priorities of CWRD DMCs. \nConsultation  meetings  will  help  identify  credible  and  scalable  PSP  and  PPP  projects  and \ndevelopment opportunities in the CWA region, and help market ADB\u2019s transaction support \nproducts. The consultations will also help in identifying gender-responsive and socially inclusive \ndesign features to be integrated in the identified projects. The consultation meetings will allow \nrelevant  PSP  and  PPP  stakeholders  to  showcase  successful  gender-responsive,  socially \ninclusive PSP projects and PPPs in the CWA region to stimulate knowledge sharing and learning \nacross  DMCs,  and  thereby  enable  ADB  to  advocate  credible  PSP  and  PPP  modalities, \nsustainable and fiscally responsible revenue streams, and management models and mechanisms. \nThe TA will also support priority knowledge events and workshops that may emerge from the \nconsultation meetings. \n \n12.  All regional consultation events will be arranged following the One ADB approach in close \nconsultation with CWRD resident missions and sector divisions, OPPP, PSOD, and other ADB \ndepartments as appropriate. In addition to marketing the ADB transaction support products, the \nTA will disseminate knowledge and support existing PSP and PPP knowledge products supported \nby ADB and other multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the Association of Project \nManagers Group PPP Certification Program training and certification,12 Sustainable Infrastructure \nFoundation\u2013SOURCE,13 and the ADB PPP monitor report.14  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($400,000 TASF-6 and $100,000 TASF-other sources). The \nkey expenditures are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  To leverage the TA resources, additional cofinancing of the eligible development efforts \nwill be sought from existing facilities that provide financial resources and technical support for \nPSP and PPP capacity-building activities and preparation of infrastructure projects, such as \n \n11 This may include transaction advice, financing through sovereign and nonsovereign windows, credit enhancement, \nproject loans, policy and results-based loans, project development funds, and other financing modalities. \n12 This is a joint initiative by several MDBs, including ADB, and partly funded by the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure \nAdvisory Facility, with a shared vision of enhancing PPP performance globally. \n13 The Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation, a nonprofit Swiss foundation headquartered in Geneva, coordinates the \noperational provision of SOURCE. SOURCE is the multilateral platform for quality infrastructure, led and funded by \nMDBs. It brings a systemic change in the way governments define, develop, and manage their infrastructure projects \nfor both traditional procurement and PPPs. \n14 ADB. 2019.

The PPP monitor aims to serve as a policy \ntool to create a dialogue between public and private sectors and provide an enabling environment for PPPs. \n \n ", "4 \nthe Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF),15 ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility, and other \nexternal and internal facilities established by ADB and other development partners. Provision is \nmade for two regional consultation events over the TA implementation period. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will act as executing agency and will administer the TA through the newly established \nClient Solutions Team (CST) team in CWRD. The CST will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants. To accelerate the One ADB approach, close coordination and collaboration will be \nundertaken with CWRD\u2019s sector divisions and resident missions, OPPP, PSOD, and other ADB \ndepartments and sector and thematic groups, where relevant, to promote synergies with ongoing \ndevelopment efforts. \n \n16.  Because of the diverse requirements and activities expected to be carried out under the \nTA, both individual consultants and firms will be recruited. Specific terms of reference (TORs) will \nbe developed as part of the project screening process. Wherever possible, the OPPP\u2019s framework \nagreements for individual consultants16 and firms17 will be used to ensure fast mobilization of \nconsultancy services. If necessary, further framework agreements will be set up in advance to \ncover services that may be supported by the TA on a recurrent basis. The TA will maximize the \nuse of available ADB expertise and will allow the participation of relevant ADB staff as resource \npersons. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2020\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  TBD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Competitive  Consulting package 1 (as may be  TBD \n(QCBS 90:10),  needed): \nframework agreement or  International expertise (TBD person-\ndirect contracting  months); national expertise (TBD \nperson-months) \nIndividual: Framework  International consultants (24 person- $134,000 \nagreement or individual  months) \nselection  National consultants (8 person- $45,000 \nmonths) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance, TBD = to be \ndetermined. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.

GIF supports project screening assessments as well as project definition assistance on a purely grant basis. \n16 Each framework agreement empanels several individual consultants that can be hired directly under call-off \nassignments without competition. Currently, several framework agreements have been set up by the OPPP covering \nPPP-related services in various sectors. \n17 Up to six firms are empaneled under various sector framework agreements by the OPPP. These firms can be \nengaged under call-off contracts without the need for prior short-listing. \n \n ", "5 \nand/or staff instructions.18 Consulting services and training programs will be on an as-needed \nbasis that will respond quickly and flexibly to circumstances and demands as may be requested \nby the governments and/or identified by ADB. The TA is categorized as complex given that its \nscope involves the assessment of multiple pilot project delivery approaches, collaborative internal \nand external review procedures and processes, and the possibility of cofinancing by other \ndevelopment partners and/or facilities. \n \n18.  CST, CWRD resident missions and sector divisions, OPPP, and/or PSOD will identify \ncandidate PSP projects and PPPs and prepare an initial project identification memo (PIM)19 \nand/or a PSR.20 The initial PIM and PSR will highlight the critical information gaps, which shall be \nfilled out and/or validated using the TA resources, and incorporate TORs for the consultancy \nservices to be supported by the TA. It is expected that the estimated value of each project \nscreening consultancy assignment will not exceed $50,000. CST will prioritize PIMs and PSRs \nfor projects promoting cooperation and integration initiatives in the CWA region, including ADB\u2019s \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program. \n \n19.  CST will discuss all initial PIMs and PSRs, including draft TORs, with the relevant CWRD \nresident mission and sector division and OPPP with the objective of finalizing the TORs and \nidentifying possible cofinancing opportunities. Where determined necessary or appropriate, CST \nwill involve other ADB departments and field fact-finding and consultation missions to DMCs. CST \nwill finalize each PSR on the basis of the feedback received from the TA consultants and submit \nthe PSR to the relevant CWRD resident mission and sector division, OPPP, and/or PSOD with \nthe objective of determining if the proposed project merits further ADB transaction support. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n20.  The project screening activities under the TA will include a review of the governance \nframework in place at the level of the prospective project. Any deficiencies and the related action \nplan to address these will be shared with the relevant stakeholders as part of the PSRs. CST will \ncoordinate the feedback provided to the CWRD resident missions and sector divisions, OPPP, \nPSOD, and other ADB departments, and follow up on the potential ADB transaction support that \nmay originate from the project screening activities supported by the TA with the relevant ADB \ndepartments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nScaling Up Private Sector Participation in the Infrastructure Sector in the Central and West Asia \nRegion, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n18 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n19 Sample Project Identification Memo (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n20 Project Screening Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \n(i) Sustainability of private sector investments in infrastructure projects in ADB\u2019s CWRD DMCs improved; \n(ii) DMCs\u2019 capacity to plan, develop, and sustainably finance infrastructure using PSP and PPP modalities \nincreased; and \n(iii) ADB\u2019s knowledge services strengthened (ADB Strategy 2030)a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nADB transaction  Three sustainable (bankable,  Approved AP3F  Weakening of political \nsupport towards  fiscally responsible, and  applications  support for PSP \nsustainable  socially and environmentally  projects and PPPs in \nOPPP transaction \n(bankable, fiscally  sustainable) infrastructure  DMCs \nadvisory services \nresponsible, and  PSP projects and PPPs move \nmandates \nsocially and  to the project definition or \nenvironmentally  preparation stage through the  Approved ADB PSP and \nsustainable)  support of the TA project by  PPP transaction support \ninfrastructure PSP  December 2022, with 50% of  projects \nprojects and PPP  the outputs of each project \nDMC government \nincreased   incorporating gender-related \nwebsites and/or related \n  targets (2020 baseline: 0) \nwebsites tracking PPP \nproject development \nOutputs       \n1.
