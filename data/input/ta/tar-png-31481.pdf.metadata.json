During the Country Programming Mission in 2000, the Government of Papua New Guinea \n(PNG) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed that ADB will provide grant funding for a \ntechnical assistance (TA) in 2003 to prepare a project for possible ADB funding in 2004. The \nagreement  was  confirmed  during  the  Country  Programming  Mission  in  May  2002.  The \ndevelopment  of  human  resources  is  considered  a  crucial  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall \ndevelopment policy. This is reflected in the Government\u2019s commitment to  \u201cEducation for All,\u201d \nwhich includes a 50% improvement in the level of adult literacy by 2015. The proposed project \nwill  also  build  on  and  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support  for  employment-oriented  skills \ndevelopment and microfinance.1  \n \n2.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited PNG on 17\u201326 February 2003.2 The Mission visited \nthe provinces of Eastern Highlands, East Sepik, Enga, and Madang and consulted with a wide \nrange of stakeholders. An information session for members of parliament provided the Mission \nwith  the  opportunity  to  present  the  findings  to  high-level  political  decision  makers.  The \nGovernment has agreed with the TA goals, purpose, scope and implementation arrangements, \ncost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix 1, \nand  the  summary  initial  social  and  poverty  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  Government \nreconfirmed its strong interest in and support for the TA and highlighted its timeliness.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  PNG is lagging far behind other Pacific countries in achieving most of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs).4 After 25 years of political independence and some economic and \nsocial progress, a large percentage of the PNG people remain poor. Some MDG indicators reflect \ndeterioration,  particularly  those  for  health,  while  education  and  gender  equality  show  little \nprogress and are far from achieving their targets by 2015. Enrollment ratios at all levels are low, \nwith completion rates for primary schools reaching only 49%. Difficult access and long distances \nto educational facilities in rural areas have been cited as important reasons for low ratios.5 \n \n4.  A major concern in the development process of PNG and a consequence of the low \nenrollment and completion ratios is the low literacy rate, particularly among women, in rural areas \nand in the highland regions. On average, 51.9% of adults aged 25 years and above are illiterate, \nranging from the highest illiteracy rate of 72.2% among women in rural areas in the highland \nprovince of Enga to the lowest illiteracy rate of 5.3% among women in the island province of \nManus. A significant gender gap exists, with literacy levels of women being 14% lower than those \nof men. However, the gender gap is less noticeable in youth literacy (15\u201324 years) and has \nincreased to 10%.  \n \n5.  Literacy in PNG has a very unique dimension, which has 5.5 million people, PNG is one of \nthe most linguistically and culturally diverse nations. PNG has more than 830 languages, the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. EOSD. Loan 1706-PNG (SF, for SDR14,591,000, approved on 28 October 1999). Manila.

Iffland, project economist and mission leader, ADB Headquarters; and W. Kubitzki, \neducation specialist and consultant. J. Sukwianomb, secretary, and J. Klapat,  deputy secretary, Department of \nSocial Welfare and Development; K. Tau, senior planner\u2013education, Department of National Planning and Rural \nDevelopment accompanied the mission. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 15 February 2003. \n4  ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n5 The main focus of assistance provided by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) addresses \nbasic education infrastructure, curriculum development and material production, and teacher training. ", "2   \nmajority of which are unwritten. Alphabets for most of these vernacular languages, which are \nfundamentally different from each other, have yet to be developed. Some languages are spoken \nby less than 500 people, others by over 300,000. The languages are not only a means of \ncommunication; they are essential to cultural identity.  \n \n6.  Adult literacy is considered by all major stakeholders an essential tool for community \ndevelopment and poverty alleviation. The ability to read and write empowers community people to \nparticipate actively in the development process. The ability to read information and news on \nvarious topics enhances the understanding of economic and social interrelations and opens new \navenues to apply appropriate technologies and to generate additional income. Literate mothers \nare able to read health instructions; literate community members will improve their opportunities \nby interacting with public authorities on legal, environmental, and other relevant issues. \n \n7.  Universal \u201cbasic education\u201d as defined in the National Education Plan focuses on children \nand  youth.  Basic  adult  education  and  literacy  training  is  considered  outside  of  the  formal \neducation  system  and,  hence,  does  not  fall  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Department  of \nEducation  (DOE).  One  source  of  confusion  among  literacy  implementers  has  been  the \nuncertainty over which government department has the responsibility for literacy and nonformal \neducation. In 1986, the Government transferred responsibility for nonformal education from DOE \nto the Department of Home Affairs and Youth, which was later renamed the Department of Social \nWelfare and Development (DSWD). In 1990, the responsibility was transferred back to DOE and \nthe National Literacy and Awareness Secretariat (NLAS), which was created during the same \nyear. In 1995, the Organic Law on Provincial Government was introduced, and states that \n\u201cliteracy is the responsibility of local-level governments (LLGs) and funds for literacy are sent to \nprovinces to be used by LLGs.\u201d However, low or no budget allocations show that literacy is not a \npriority of LLGs at present. In most provinces, neither sufficient staff nor adequate funds are \navailable to promote literacy programs. LLGs\u2019 awareness about the value of basic education and \nliterate communities is extremely poor. \n \n8.  In 2000, the National Literacy Policy was endorsed. The policy determines that DOE is the \nlead agency for nonformal education. The policy assumes that the technical know-how and the \ncapacity to provide guidance in teacher training, curriculum development, material production, \nand awareness creation is available at provincial, district, and LLG levels. The reality is rather \ndifferent and does not confirm this assumption. Public support for promoting adult literacy was \nrated poor. Overlapping roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders and lack of funds, \nqualified staff, and/or technical expertise aggravate this situation. In 2002, DSWD's mandate was \nexpanded with the endorsement of the National Executive Council. The new policy states that \nDSWD is the focal point for the informal sector, which includes nonformal education.  \n \n9.  Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and churches have assumed the major role in \nsupporting  literacy  programs  in  PNG  due  to  (i)  the  absence  of  a  systematic  coordination \nmechanism  linked  to  the  formal  education  system;  (ii)  the  lack  of  detailed  clarifications  of \nresponsibilities among communities, and provincial and national government agencies promoting \nadult  literacy;  and  (iii)  insufficient  provision  of  funds  for  literacy  programs.  However, the \ncapacities of NGOs and churches promoting adult literacy are limited, hence slow progress in \nimproving literacy rates is inevitable under the current circumstances. \n \n10.  Most of the adult literacy programs in PNG are community-driven. The success and the \nquality of adult literacy programs depend very much on the commitment of communities and the \nengagement and qualification of community teachers. Over 2,000 community-based adult literacy ", "     3\nsites exist in PNG.6 Community ownership is essential for the sustainability of adult literacy \nprograms.  Community  commitment  may  range  from  building  classrooms  and  compensating \nvolunteer  teachers  to  fund-raising activities to provide learning materials and other support. \nCommunity-based adult literacy sites and programs are supported by NGOs, community-based \norganizations, churches, and government agencies mainly through teacher training, curriculum \ndevelopment, provision of learning material, awareness, and advocacy. No consistent system has \nbeen developed for adult literacy, and the quality and quantity of this assistance differ from \nprovince to province according to the potential of the support providers.   \n \n11.  Adult literacy is no longer seen as an end in itself, but as means of gaining useful \nknowledge  and  skills  in  a  context.  Adult  literacy  programs  are  increasingly  responding  to \neconomic needs. Functional literacy education is requested by adults in the communities to \nimprove their income generation opportunities. However, communities in remote areas  with \nlimited opportunities to earn cash and no reading materials in their language other than the Bible \nand songbooks do not see the value in being literate. To further the development of PNG and its \npeople, and to reduce poverty in rural and urban areas,  the challenges associated with adult \nliteracy must be addressed, particularly the lack of awareness and appreciation for literacy, lack \nof information about literacy providers and programs, insufficient teacher training and learning \nmaterials,  lack  clear  responsibility  among  government  agencies,  and  nonexistence  of  a \ncoordinating mechanism among NGOs and between NGOs and the Government.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA will assist the Government to (i) design a comprehensive strategy to further adult \nliteracy in PNG; and (ii) prepare Literacy Is For Everyone (LIFE), an adult literacy project. \nLanguages with orthographies, of which there are currently 129, will be the focus of the TA. The \nTA will have the following outputs: (i) design and pilot testing of (a) a national adult literacy \ncampaign, and (b) a strategy to create awareness among the communities; (ii) a proposal for an \namended national literacy policy clarifying roles and responsibilities at all levels of government; \n(iii) an outline for an institutional capacity building strategy for core divisions and departments \nresponsible for adult literacy; (iv) the design of an information system on adult literacy; (v) the \ndesign of a trainer and teacher training system; (vi) pilot testing of new methods and materials to \nfurther adult literacy; and (vii) a proposed project design. The TA will be implemented in four \nprovinces: Eastern Highlands, East Sepik, Enga, and Madang and will target communities in \nremote areas and women on a pilot basis.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Output 1.  DSWD and NLAS, supported by an international consultant, will implement the \nfollowing activities. (i) A stakeholder workshop will be conducted to determine the scope of the \nnational awareness campaign targeted at decision makers. (ii) A national marketing company will \nbe contracted to design and run the campaign for  3 months. (iii) Parliamentary information \nsessions at the national level and seminars with LLGs will be used to generate understanding of \nand support for adult literacy. (iv) Provincial workshops will be held, with adult literacy providers  \nfocusing  on  determining  suitable  pilot  activities  for  how  best  to  generate  interest  in  the \ncommunities.  (v)  The  provincial  focal  points  for  adult  literacy,  in  cooperation  with  literacy \n                                                 \n6  Data and information on adult literacy required by policy makers, support providers, and literacy implementers are \nscarce and scattered, collected on an ad hoc basis, and often out of date and inconsistent, which makes planning \nand monitoring difficult. ", "4   \nproviders, will carry out two pilot activities in each province .7 Provincial community awareness \nstrategies will be designed based on the results of the pilot activities.  \n \n14.  Output 2.  The second output focuses on the institutional arrangements and seeks to \nclarify the roles and responsibilities of government at all levels. Following an analysis of the \nweaknesses of the current policies and directives, a series of provincial and national workshops \nwith government agencies  will  be  held  to  clarify  and  reach  agreement  on  responsibilities; \nchannels  of  communication;  and  linkages  between  national,  provincial,  district,  and  local \ngovernments. Nongovernment stakeholders will be engaged in a further series of discussions to \ndevelop suitable coordinating mechanisms with Government and among themselves.  \n \n15.  Output 3.  The institutional capacity of the Community Development Division at national \nand provincial level, NLAS, and literacy focal point divisions/organizations at provincial level will \nbe  assessed.  Initial  training  measures  of  selected  staff  are  aimed  at  creating  a  better \nunderstanding  of  community-driven  development  including  adult  literacy  training.  Output  3 \nconcludes with the joint design of a capacity building strategy with human resources development \nplans.  \n \n16.  Output 4.  An information system on adult literacy will be designed, in cooperation with \nNLAS, by a specialist in information management in education.  After sources of information are \nidentified, a workshop will be conducted with key literacy organizations, NLAS, and provincial \nfocal points to determine the scope of the data base and the type of data to be collected, and to \nreach agreement on the data collection process. After the first stage of data collection, a training \ncourse will be conducted  on data entry and management and a strategy on the maintenance of \nthe data base and a performance management system will be agreed upon with the provincial \nfocal points.   \n \n17.  Output 5. The Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) will be engaged to lead a working \ngroup  of  teacher  training  organizations  in  cooperation  with  NLAS.  The  working  group  will \nexchange information and experience on teacher training and jointly determining the necessary \ncontent of (i) multiplier/core trainer training, (ii) teacher training, (iii) in-service training, and (iv) an \naccreditation system. SIL will assemble 10 kits for testing by SIL's trainee teachers. Based on the \nevaluation of the kit, a prototype will be developed including specifications and costs.  \n \n18.  Output  6.    Brainstorming  sessions  at  the  provincial  level  with  NGOs  and  churches \ninvolved in adult literacy training, will be used to identify new methods and materials currently not \napplied in PNG. Examples could include work place literacy programs tested with larger gold \nmining operations in rural areas, newsletters and brochures in areas where the Bible and song \nbooks are the only written materials available, easy readers and short stories to test the interest \nin leisure reading, and radio and tape-recorded programs using solar-powered equipment to \nsupport community literacy programs in remote areas. An assessment of these activities\u2019 impacts  \nwill form the basis for developing a strategy for replication. \n \n19.  Output 7.  A design will be made for the proposed ensuing loan project. The design will \nincorporate the outcomes of the outputs 1-6 and will include social and poverty assessments, and \ngender financial, economic, and institutional analyses.  \n \n                                                 \n7 The focal points and divisions are (i) the Council of Women in East Sepik Province, (ii) the Division of Education in the \nprovinces of Madang and Enga, (iii) and the Division of Community Development in Eastern Highlands Province. ", "     5\nC.  Cost and Financing  \n20.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $780,000 equivalent, of which $380,000 is the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $400,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$220,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis \nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide \ncounterpart staff, domestic staff travel, office, and communication facilities amounting to $180,000 \nequivalent in local currency. The TA will finance (i) an adult literacy awareness campaign, (ii) \nDSWD\u2019s  human  resources  capacity  building,  (iii)  development  of  the  training  concept  and \nproduction  of  training  materials,  (iv)  a  series  of  national  and  provincial  workshops  and    a \nconference, (v) computer hardware and software and a prototype trainer kit, and (vi) international \nconsulting services. Procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement \nguidelines. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that \nthe approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  DSWD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Implementation will be carried out in \ncooperation with NLAS, and the focal points for adult literacy at the provincial level. DSWD will \nset up a project management unit with qualified counterpart staff, and will provide office space, \nand transport and communication facilities. DSWD and NLAS will work on a day-to-day basis with \nthe team of international consultants.  \n \n22.  The TA will require 15.5 person-months of international individual consultants specialized \nin  (i)  education  policy  and  organizational  development  (the  team  leader),  (ii)  community \nawareness and social mobilization, (iii) information management in education, (iv) participatory \nplanning, and (v) other specific areas as required8 (for 2 person-months). The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 4. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 16 months (May \n2003\u2013September 2004). The team leader will submit  (i) an inception report, 4 weeks after \ncommencement of the assignment; and (ii) a draft final report, 2 weeks before, and a final report, \n2 weeks after, the participatory planning workshop, incorporating the findings of the team. SIL9 \nwill be directly contracted to design the teacher training, in-service training, and accreditation \nsystem, and to develop a prototype teacher kits. The expected TA completion date is September \n2004.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Papua New Guinea for preparing the Literacy is for Everyone Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board \n \n                                                 \n8 The results of the institutional assessment, to be carried out under output 3, will determine which specific expertise is \nrequired for a first upgrading of DSWD\u2019s human resources. \n9 SIL, a nonprofit Christian NGO, assists communities in PNG with language development, establishes orthographies \nor alphabets in local languages, and develops literacy material. Established in 1956, SIL is the most experienced \norganization in literacy teacher training and curriculum development in PNG. It has a unique capacity to design and \nimplement a prototype program for teacher training suitable for nationwide replication.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national    \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement (PPA)? \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  addressing  social  and \neconomic equity related issues through the implementation \nof  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy.  Poverty \nreduction  is  a  primary  goal  of  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment  Strategy  2003\u20132007.  The  process \ncommenced  in  September  2001  and  is  expected  to  be \nconcluded with the signing of a poverty agreement in the \nfourth quarter of 2003.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: ConsumerPrice Index  \n1. What type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nWhile national and regional poverty lines have been established, additional information will be collected to determine \nthe incidence of nonfinancial poverty. This will focus on access to basic services and participation in the decision \nmaking processes at the village level and local level government. \n \nIn a 1999 report, the World Bank assessed poverty and access to basic services. This was followed by PPA  funded \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which commenced in 2001. The results of the PPA were used as the \nfoundation of the National Poverty Reduction Strategy. Both rural and urban poverty is reflected in terms of lack of \ndevelopment in four broad areas: (i) cash (income generating opportunities including employment), (ii) education, (iii) \nhealth and hygiene, and (iv) infrastructure (access to roads and transport).  \n \nIn summary, most Papua New Guineans, especially women, are suffering increasing hardship due to the prolonged \nrecession and continued lack of income-earning opportunities. (The term \u201cpoverty\u201d is considered derogatory in the \nMelanesian context. Poverty is thus characterized in terms of lack of access to services and income-generating \nopportunities.) People employed in the formal sector have had their real incomes decline; and most people have \nexperienced diminish opportunities for income-generation. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of Papua New \nGuineans living below the national poverty line is estimated to have doubled. The poverty headcount index was \n39.6% in 2002. An estimated 70% of the population, or 3.7 million Papua New Guineans, now live on less than $2 per \nday, up from 54% in 1996. The key factor underlying the increase in poverty over the last 5 years has been the \ncontinued failure of growth. \n \nPoverty is overwhelmingly rural. Of the poor, 94% live in rural areas, and 75% of the poor live in the Sepik, North \nCoast, and Highlands regions. Poverty is highest in female-headed households and in households dependent on \ncocoa, copra, fishing, and hunting-gathering. The most vulnerable groups are female-headed households, female \nyouth, and the elderly. Rural-urban income disparities are widening, as are disparities between communities within \nand outside the immediate surroundings, and isolated resource projects (eg., mines, plantations). Households with \nwage  employment  in  the  formal  sector  have  a  17%    incidence  of  poverty,  compared  to  those  engaged  in \nagriculture/cash-crop production (44%). Inequality in Papua New Guinea (PNG) ranks among the highest in East Asia \nand the Pacific; Gini coefficient in PNG is 0.46. \n \nHigh levels of illiteracy coincide with high levels of poverty. The Momase region, which comprises East and West \nSepik, Madang, and Morobe province, accounts for almost 36 percent of the poor in PNG and 29% of the population \nwith an average literacy rate of 51%.  The Highland region (Eastern, Western and Southern Highlands, Enga, and \nChimbu province), with about 40 percent of the population, accounts for 38 percent of the poor and an average literacy \nrate of 42%. The literacy rate among women is on average 14% lower then men.  \n \nThe selection of  the pilot provinces  \u2013 East Sepik, Madang, Eastern Highlands and Enga  \u2013 is based on the \ncombination of high poverty incidence and high illiteracy rates. It is anticipated that more than 50% of the \nbeneficiaries live below the poverty line. The design will focus on poverty beneficiary-specific interventions and will \ntherefore ensure that the poor will reap the majority of the benefits.  \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: A first analysis has been carried out and outputs 2,3,4 have been included in the TA as a result \nof  it.  A  final  verification  of  the  findings  of  the  stakeholder  analysis  is  part  of  the  participatory  planning \nworkshop/ZOPP.  \nParticipatory strategy: The TA will apply a range of participatory methods, as outlined in the section II.B. These \ninclude focus group discussions with beneficiaries, NGOs/literacy training providers, and all levels of Government. \nWorkshops and seminars will be conducted at various stages to jointly develop and design the outputs 1-7 (Appendix \n1).  The  participatory  planning  workshop  will  include  representatives  of  the  beneficiaries,  nongovernment \norganizations, churches, and the government. The 5 day workshop is expected to result in a complete project logical \nframework. Further details of the participatory activities are indicated in the TA framework. A detailed work plan, \nincluding a schedule and description of the participatory methods to be applied, when and with whom, following the \noutline of the participatory strategy summary chart, will be compiled prior to commencement of the TA in cooperation \nwith the team of consultants.  \nParticipation strategy required: deferred  \nD.   Gender and Development \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women: The proposed project will specifically benefit women and youth. Special \nattention will be given by the TA to determine the motivating and hindering factors for women to participate in literacy \nclasses. These aspects will in turn be incorporated in the design of each intervention. Gender analysis is part of the \nTA and a gender strategy will be prepared under the TA.  \nE.
