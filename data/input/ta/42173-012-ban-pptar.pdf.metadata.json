Although the technical feasibility study was undertaken under the ongoing loan, a project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is necessary in order to carry out due diligence on \ntechnical, economic, financial, governance, poverty and social, and safeguards for the ensuing \nloan. The PPTA is also required to explore the public-private partnership (PPP) and propose the \nmost viable alternative for PPP with specific institutional, legal, and financial arrangements for \nimproving the service delivery of water supply in Dhaka.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The PPTA will produce a complete feasibility study of the ensuing project that satisfies the \nrequirements of ADB and the government. The PPTA will also enhance project readiness and \ncontribute to smooth start-up of the ensuing loan, by assisting the government and Dhaka Water \nSupply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA), the executing agency of the project, in undertaking \nadvance actions. \n \n3.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nReview of existing studies and  August 2012  Inception report  August 2012 \nongoing project \nProposed design of the project  November 2012  Draft final report  November 2012 \nFinal  design  of  the  project  January 2013  Final report  January 2013 \nincluding PPP arrangement \nSupport  for  enhancement  of  March 2014     \nproject  readiness  and \nexpediting implementation \nPPP = public-private partnership.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n     \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $900,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV).

Consulting Services \n \n5.  The TA will require about 56 person-months of consulting services (20 international and \n36 national). A team of consultants will be recruited under one package using the quality- and \ncost-based method of selection with a standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20 in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A simplified \ntechnical  proposal  will  be  used  for  the  selection  of  a  firm.  A  small  number  of  individual \nconsultants will be additionally engaged to undertake safeguards due diligence and enhance \nproject readiness and expedite project implementation, on an as-needed basis.
