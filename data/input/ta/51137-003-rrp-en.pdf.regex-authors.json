THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Dhaka and Western Zone Transmission Grid \nExpansion Project. The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation \nFund (PRC Fund), and (ii) the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided by the \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the grant and the loan. \n \n2.  The project will contribute to the goal of the Government of Bangladesh to achieve electricity \nfor all by 2021.1 It will improve the reliability and efficiency of the electricity supply in the Greater \nDhaka and western zone of Bangladesh by expanding the national transmission grid system and \nstrengthening the capacity of the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB).2 The project \nwill also expand regional power connectivity in western Bangladesh. Specifically, it will support            \n(i) the construction of 40 kilometers (km) of transmission lines and 4,450 megavolt-amperes (MVA) \nof substations in Greater Dhaka; (ii) the construction of 368 km of transmission lines, 3,070 MVA of \nsubstations, and 20 bay extensions in the western zone; and (iii) the establishment of an enterprise \nresource planning (ERP) system and a drone inspection center to strengthen PGCB\u2019s capacity in \nasset management and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic  development.  Prudent  macroeconomic  management  helped  Bangladesh \nachieve  average  annual  GDP  growth  of  6.5%  during  fiscal  year  (FY)  2009  to  FY2018.3 \nBangladesh reached lower-middle-income country status in FY2015, and gross national income per \ncapita has risen steadily from $1,316 in FY2015 to $1,751 in FY2018.4 The structure of the \nBangladesh economy is gradually shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and services. Poverty \nrate has been halved from 2000 to 2016, and  the country has met many of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets.5 Building on these achievements, the government has set new priority \ntargets to (i) accelerate annual economic growth to 8.0% by 2021; (ii) create jobs and support rural \ndevelopment and inclusive growth to reduce poverty; (iii) reduce poverty rate to 18.6% by 2020, from \n24.8% in 2015 below the national poverty line, and reduce extreme poverty rate to 8.9% by 2020, \n                                                \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning, Planning Commission. 2012.

Western zone of Bangladesh comprises of the divisions of Rangpur, \nRajshahi, Gopalganji, Khulna, and Barishal. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Bureau of Statistics. http://www.bbs.gov.bd/ (accessed 15 January 2019). \n4  Footnote 3, and World Bank. Data: World Bank Country and Lending Groups.  \nhttps://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups  \n(accessed 8 March 2019). A country is classified as lower-middle-income if its gross national income per capita \naverages $996\u2013$3,895, and as upper-middle-income if it averages $3,896\u2013$12,055. \n5  The national poverty line is set to the threshold of a minimum intake of 2,122 kilocalorie per person per day of food, \nand the extreme poverty line is set to the threshold of living on less than $1.90 per person per day (2011 Purchasing \nPower Parity). \n \n ", "2 \nfrom 12.9% in 2015 below the extreme poverty line (footnote 5); and (iv) reduce environmental \ndegradation and reduce vulnerability to climate change.6 \n \n4.  Despite its economic success, Bangladesh faces major challenges in maintaining growth \ntrends and reducing poverty because of infrastructure deficiencies in the energy sector and \nelsewhere. To address these deficiencies, the government is prioritizing the provision of modern, \nreliable, and affordable energy services to those who lack access.7 \n \n5.  Power generation and access. The energy sector has seen considerable progress in \nincreasing generation capacity to meet the growing demand for electricity. Daily load shedding \ndropped significantly from 2,264 gigawatt-hours in FY2007 to 32 gigawatt-hours in FY2018. \nHowever, the sector is still characterized by recurring power supply shortages in the face of       \never-rising demand in a growing economy. In FY2017, the estimated peak power demand in \nBangladesh was 12,644 megawatts (MW). However, the utilities in the electricity industry served \nonly 9,479 MW of this demand. While commercial and industrial consumers met a significant \namount of the remaining demand with captive generation, a portion of power demand was \ncurtailed through load shedding.8 The government forecast in 2016 that planned and ongoing \npower generation projects would generate additional power exceeding 13,300 MW by 2020 and \n19,900 MW by 2025.9 With the government\u2019s effort to expand electrification, the country achieved \n91% electricity access in FY2018, although about 15 million people out of 163.7 million population \nin Bangladesh still lack access to electricity.  \n \n6.  Power transmission. The power transmission system is solely owned and operated by \nPGCB. Investments to strengthen the power network and measures taken to reduce nontechnical \nlosses have resulted in a decline in overall system losses. However, interruptions (i.e., customers \nlose  access  to  electrical  grid)  resulting  from  transmission  system  issues  throughout  the \ntransmission network increased from 15 interruptions in FY2017 to 60 interruptions in FY2018, \nwith the cumulative duration of outages increasing from almost 20 hours to 80 hours (footnote 8). \nBecause of weakness in power system control and operation, system frequency and voltage \nfluctuate beyond established standards, which causes excessive wear-and-tear on electrical \nequipment and interrupts the power supply. As the economy grows and the power grid becomes \nmore congested, upgrading and expanding the transmission network will be crucial.  \n \n7.  Regional power connectivity. The power transmission grid is connected with India\u2019s grid \nand Bangladesh imports 1,000 MW of power from India through a high voltage direct current \nsubstation at Bheramara in the western zone. However, this power flows into the national power \ngrid via a 400-kilovolt (kV) to 230 kV transmission line without directly dispatching the power to \nlocal consumers in the western zone. To ensure that power interconnection operates at its full \ncapacity and that imported power is utilized across western Bangladesh, the transmission system \nwithin the western zone needs to be strengthened.  \n \n8.  Energy sector governance. PGCB is a state-owned enterprise incorporated as a public \nlimited company in 1996 under the Companies Act, 1994. The Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard (BPDB), a wholly government-owned entity, owns 76.25% of the share capital of PGCB, \n                                                \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Dhaka. \n ", "3 \nwith the balance held by various institutions and individual shareholders. PGCB has been listed \nin the Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chattgrom Stock Exchange since 2006. The authorized capital \nat the time of establishment was Tk10 billion.  \n \n9.  Despite  substantial  improvements  in  operational  and  financial  performance,  weak \nfinancial management capacity within PGCB and low-cost recovery tariffs in the past have \nimpaired its financial health. From FY2011 to FY2018, PGCB saw revenues increase because of \nincreased electricity sales. However, its after-tax profit margin shrank from FY2011 to FY2014, \nmainly because of delayed and/or insufficient increases in transmission tariffs. PGCB had a \nnegative after-tax profit margin of Tk29 million in FY2015. In September 2015, the government \nincreased the transmission tariff from 0.229 Tk/kWh to 0.279 Tk/kWh and PGCB realized a net \nprofit from FY2016 to FY2018. However, given the need for increased investments in the \ntransmission system, PGCB\u2019s return on net fixed assets is declining in the absence of regular \ntransmission  tariff  adjustments.  Furthermore,  while  it  has  prioritized  transmission  system \nexpansion, PGCB needs to concentrate more on O&M to reduce transmission losses and ensure \nthe reliability and quality of the power supply. \n \n10.  Government programs. To sustain the country\u2019s economic growth momentum, the \ngovernment  has  prepared  the  Power  System  Master  Plan  (footnote  9)  to  increase                      \npower-generation capacity, as well as improve and extend the power transmission and distribution \nnetwork,  with  the  aim  of  achieving  universal  access  to  electricity  by  2021.  Furthermore, \nBangladesh\u2019s Seventh Five Year Plan (footnote 6) envisages an integrated development strategy \nfor the Greater Dhaka area and western zone encompassing Dhaka, Khulna, and Barishal, which \nare economic growth centers. Energy reforms have led to the unbundling of the power supply \nindustry, resulting in (i) a reduction in overall system losses from more than 30% of generation in \nthe 1990s to 13%\u201315% of generation; (ii) the establishment of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory \nCommission  (BERC)  in  2004;  and (iii)  approval  of  an  electricity  transmission  tariff fixation \nmethodology in 2015 by the government.  \n \n11.  Asian Development Bank assistance to the sector. Since the mid-1990s and in \ncollaboration with development partners, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing \nextensive support for energy sector reforms in Bangladesh and the sustainable development of \nthe sector, including support for the creation of PGCB. This support has resulted in significant \nimprovements in the operational and financial performance of the sector. As part of its strategy \nfor the sector, ADB has supported the corporatization and commercialization of energy entities \nas well as the expansion and upgrading of the power system as part of a least-cost expansion \nplan. ADB has been a key financier of PGCB\u2019s fast-expanding transmission investments.10 ADB \nand the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources are co-chairs of the Local Consultative \nGroup for the sector, which enhances the effectiveness of ADB assistance. The group facilitates \nenergy project cofinancing among development partners, conducts policy dialogue on addressing \ngrid code application issues, develops the financing strategy for PGCB, and works on building \nPGCB\u2019s  asset  registry.  ADB  is  now  turning  its  focus  towards  improving  PGCB\u2019s  financial \n                                                \n10  ADB assistance includes the following: ADB. 2007.

This includes staffing finance positions in the company \nwith qualified personnel, addressing issues related to the fixed-asset registry, and seeking timely \ntariff adjustments through regular tariff filing. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, \n2016\u22122020 highlights ADB\u2019s support for easing infrastructure constraints in key sectors like the \nenergy sector.11 With increasing demand for a reliable and high-quality power supply, not only \ndoes PGCB need to invest in new transmission infrastructure but it also needs to improve its O&M \npractices, which directly impact the reliability and quality of the power supply. ADB\u2019s continued \nengagement in the energy sector, particularly at PGCB, will help address these issues.  \n \n12.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s experience in transmission system projects in South Asia have \nshown that the success and sustainability of projects hinge on (i) advanced planning and detailed \nproject  preparation;  (ii)  strong  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies  in  project  preparation, \nprocurement,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  project  implementation;  and                         \n(iii) incorporating O&M requirements at the early stage of project design and implementation. The \nproject team will incorporate these lessons in the implementation of the proposed project. \n \n13.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB will add value by developing capacity and \nintroducing high-level technology applications at PGCB. In the Southwest Transmission Grid \nExpansion Project approved in 2018, ADB assisted PGCB in using high-temperature low-sag \nconductors  and  developing  a  detailed,  time-bound  action  plan  to  implement  an  enterprise \nresource planning (ERP) system.12 ADB will help equip PGCB\u2019s workforce with technical skills \nalong with new and advanced technologies to modernize and maintain the power transmission \ninfrastructure. As a continuation of this effort, the project will finance the use of high- temperature \nlow-sag  conductors  to  improve  reliability  and  efficiency  of  electricity  supply  and  the \nimplementation of the ERP system to improve PGCB\u2019s information flow, financial capacity, and \noptimization of corporate operations. In addition, the proposed PRC Fund grant will pilot a drone \ninspection center to support high-level technology application and digitize PGCB\u2019s operations, \nwhich  will  improve  O&M  efficiency  and  enhance  system  reliability.  The  proposed  project \ncomplements the activities of development partners in Bangladesh. Further details are in the \ndevelopment coordination and financial management assessment.13 \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s priorities (including Strategy 2030). The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020, which maps out ADB\u2019s support \nfor  government  efforts  to  expand  power  generation  capacity,  improve  the  efficiency  of \ntransmission and distribution networks, and expand regional interconnections (footnote 11). The \nproject supports five operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) accelerating progress in \ngender equality by encouraging PGCB to employ women and supporting women\u2019s capacity \ndevelopment at the drone inspection center and within PGCB\u2019s finance division; (ii) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability by supporting the climate- and disaster-resilient design of high-temperature low-sag \nconductors and indoor gas-insulated substations (GIS);14 (iii) making cities more livable by \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2016.

Gas insulated \nsubstation can be enclosed in a building with environmental control for more climate proofing, including effective \n \n ", "5 \ntransmitting more power and more reliable power to cities; (iv) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity by introducing an ERP system to strengthen financial management at PGCB; \nand (v) fostering regional cooperation and integration by strengthening the transmission network \nin the Bheramara area, which will enhance power trade between India and Bangladesh. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: national target of electricity for all achieved \nby 2021 (footnote 1). The project will have the following outcome: reliability and efficiency of \nelectricity supply in the Greater Dhaka and western zone of Bangladesh improved.15   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Transmission system in Greater Dhaka expanded. The project will support \nthe construction and commissioning of (i) 22 km of 400 kV transmission lines; (ii) 9 km of 230 kV \ntransmission lines; (iii) 9 km of 132 kV underground cabling; and (iv) 3 indoor GIS substations \nwith a total capacity of 4,450 MVA in Greater Dhaka. \n \n17.  Output 2: Transmission system in western zone expanded. The project will support \nthe construction and commissioning of (i) 135 km of 230 kV transmission lines; (ii) 233 km of 132 \nkV transmission lines; and (iii) 12 GIS substations with a total capacity of 3,070 MVA and 20 bay \nextensions in nine existing substations. The subprojects to construct transmission lines and \nsubstations in the Kaliganj, Kushtia, Maheshpur, and Meherpur areas will enhance regional \nintegration by extending connectivity into western Bangladesh via the existing 230 kV Ishward\u2013\nKhulna transmission line. The latter is connected to the Bheramara substation, which receives \npower imported from India. \n \n18.   Output 3: Institutional capacity of Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited \nstrengthened. The project will enhance PGCB\u2019s financial management capacity by (i) supporting \nthe installation and operation of an ERP system to assist PGCB in optimally managing its capital-\nintensive assets; and (ii) establishing a drone inspection center within the O&M Department of \nPGCB to improve operation efficiency by reducing inspection time and enhancing workspace \nsafety.16 This project also aims to promote gender equality at PGCB by employing women in at \nleast 20% of technical positions at the drone inspection center, and training about 80 PGCB staff \n(at least 20% women) in operating drones and the ERP system. These activities with gender-\nrelated elements will complement ongoing activities under the Southwest Transmission Grid \nExpansion Project categorized as having some gender elements.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $750 million (Table 1). \n \n20.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).17 \n                                                \ncooling for transformers, resistance to extreme weather events and shielding from lightning, in the areas which are \nvulnerable to the impacts of climate change. \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 Drones can be operated remotely to monitor transmission lines. This means that PGCB personnel do not need to \nclimb heights or enter into dangerous or hazardous areas. This also allows PGCB to avoid unnecessary system \nshutdowns when inspecting transmission lines.  \n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  To ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation, the government has \nrequested that ADB administer the AIIB loan for procurement service. PGCB is the executing \nagency of the project. The proceeds of the ADB loan will be re-lent to PGCB under a subsidiary \nloan agreement, with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) applies to all ADB- and non-ADB-financed components under the project. PGCB will \nprocure goods, equipment, civil works, and consultants financed by ADB, AIIB, and the PRC Fund \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nreview and partially administer procurement packages financed by the AIIB loan per the ADB\u2013\nAIIB cofinancing agreement. Advance contracting is allowed. Universal procurement applies to \nthe project. In accordance with the prevailing law of Bangladesh, bidders may be excluded from \nparticipating in procurement under the project if they are from countries with which Bangladesh \nprohibits commercial relations, provided that ADB is satisfied that such exclusion does not \npreclude effective competition in relation to such procurement. PGCB has established a project \nmanagement unit for project preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting to ADB and \nthe government.  \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 17). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2019\u2013June 2024  \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024 \nEstimated loan and grant  31 December 2024 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (chair) \n                                                \n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning Commission, \nBangladesh Power Development Board, and PGCB (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  PGCB \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Project management unit at PGCB \nProcurement  OCB (international advertisement)   6 contracts (ADB)  $263,390,000  \n  3 contracts (AIIB)  $188,780,000 \n  1 goods contract (PRC  $650,000 \nFund) \nConsulting services  QCBS, FTP   31 person-months  $640,000  \nBiodata   10 person-months  $108,500 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Eligible contract packages and eligible expenditures agreed between ADB and the \nadvance contracting   executing agency may be considered for advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The project consists of building new transmission lines (both underground and overhead), \nnew substations (both indoor and outdoor), capacity enhancement of existing substations, and \nmodifications  to  existing  substations.  ADB,  AIIB,  and  the  transaction  technical  assistance \nconsultants reviewed the project list presented by PGCB for compliance with best practices in \ntransmission planning and projects. PGCB finalized the list of transmission lines and substations \nthat are proposed in the project against the forecast power demand of each division. The voltage \nlevels, technology, and equipment proposed under the project are compatible with PGCB\u2019s \nexisting standards and practices. PGCB will adhere to international standards in specifying, \ntesting, and commissioning the equipment procured under the project. To address issues related \nto climate change such as flooding and heat dissipation, PGCB incorporated high-temperature \nlow-sag  conductors  and  GIS  in  the  project  design.  Both  technologies  have  been  used  in \nBangladesh in the past, and PGCB has the know-how to incorporate these technologies. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  The project team carried out an economic analysis of the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.20 BPDB  is  developing  additional  power \ngeneration capacity to meet increasing demand for power. However, if no sufficient transmission \nand distribution infrastructure is available to evacuate the generated electricity to consumers, \nincremental demand will have to be curtailed. In the \u201cwith-project\u201d scenario, electricity can flow to \nscattered areas and will be used to meet any unserved power demand through expanded \ntransmission networks. In the \u201cwithout-project\u201d scenario, loss of economic activities occurs in the \nabsence of a reliable power supply.  \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n ", "9 \n29.  The economic analysis measured the costs and benefits of the project in constant 2019 \nprices, and confirmed that the project is economically viable. The overall economic internal rate \nof return for the project is 21.1% and its economic net present value is Tk70.843 billion. Removing \nenvironmental benefits, the overall economic internal rate of return for the project is 19.3% and \nits economic net present value is Tk58.101 billion. The economic analysis examined the project\u2019s \nsensitivity to adverse changes such as an increase in capital costs, a delay in commissioning, \nand a decrease in fuel prices. The analysis determined that the project remains economically \nviable in the face of such changes.  \n \n30.  The project team carried out a financial analysis of the project in accordance with ADB's \nHandbook for Borrowers on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.21 The financial \nanalysis measured all financial costs and benefits in constant 2019 prices. The analysis assessed \nthe project\u2019s financial viability by comparing incremental costs with incremental benefits over the \nlife of the project. Incremental revenue for outputs 1 and 2 were based on incremental electricity \ntransmitted over the project assets.  The incremental electricity wheeled was valued at the \nestimated tariff to be set by BERC under the approved transmission tariff methodology.22 The \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of the project is 1.80%. The analysis determined the \nfinancial internal rate of return of the investments to be 6.81%, which exceeds the weighted \naverage cost of capital. The analysis measured the sensitivity of the financial internal rate of return \nto adverse changes in underlying assumptions and determined the project to be financially viable.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  ADB assessed the executing agency, PGCB, against ADB\u2019s procurement and financial \nmanagement requirements. PGCB has significant experience in implementing projects financed \nby ADB, and is conversant with ADB\u2019s procurement processes and regulations. Procurement risk \nis rated low. The financial management risk is rated substantial (footnote 13). The project team \nproposed mitigation measures in the financial management assessment.23 In terms of funding \npolicy, PGCB has not committed to exit from concessional loans from development partners and \nthe government since the commercial financial market for infrastructure projects is not mature yet \nin Bangladesh. To meet its significant investment requirements, PGCB should develop a financing \nplan to tap both domestic and international financial markets. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe project. Procurement contracts financed by ADB are subject to prior ADB review and must \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the project.  \n \n32.  PGCB has prepared an action plan to address the substantial financial management risk. \nThe government  and  the  BERC  published  and  made  effective  electricity  transmission  and \ndistribution  tariff  regulations  in  June  2016.  These  regulations  established  a  transparent \nmechanism to periodically review and reset transmission tariffs to recover transmission costs and \nimprove PGCB\u2019s financial sustainability. PGCB has executed similar projects before and is \ncapable of managing the fund flow, disbursement procedures, accounting, and financial reporting \nunder the project. Mitigation measures to be taken to address key financial management risks \ninclude  the  appointment  of  additional  staff  in  the  finance,  accounting,  and  internal  audit \ndepartments of PGCB. The project will support auditors of PGCB to issue qualified audit opinions \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2005.  Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Based on these opinions, PGCB will \ncome up with a time-bound action plan to improve its audit function, including compilation of a \nfixed-asset registry; strengthening the internal audit department (including the appointment of a \ngeneral manager); and implementing the ERP that will be financed under the project to address \nrisks posed by the existing manual accounting system.  \n \n33.  ERP is an integrated information technology system that will help strengthen PGCB\u2019s \ncapabilities to manage its assets. The ERP system will standardize PGCB\u2019s business processes \nto improve transparency and improve PGCB\u2019s internal controls, creating greater accountability \nand governance within PGCB.  \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PGCB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. The project team conducted integrity due diligence and did not identify \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n35.  Out of a population of 163.7 million in 2018, 21.8% of the population lived below the \nnational  poverty  line,  a  decline  from  31.5%  in  2010.  Faster  economic  growth,  increasing \nurbanization, rising labor productivity and wages, a shift from low-return agricultural labor to \nnonfarm employment, and growth in export industries have underpinned the decline in poverty. \nAccess to a reliable supply of electricity is an important input to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. \n \n36.  The major benefit of the project will be improved access to electricity and improved delivery \nof reliable power to support sustained economic growth and reduce poverty. Improved access to a \nreliable electricity supply will promote business expansion and create employment opportunities for \nlocal communities, including the poor and socially disadvantaged. The project will also generate \njobs for local communities during construction as a direct benefit. Furthermore, the capacity \ndevelopment program under output 3 of the project will improve human resources development in \nthe energy sector. \n \n37.  The project is categorized as having some gender elements. Under output 3, the project \nwill directly support women\u2019s employment and capacity development in PGCB\u2019s finance division \nand in the drone inspection center. PGCB will ensure compliance with national labor laws, with \nno child labor employed. The contractors will educate workers through a PGCB training program \non the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. With ADB\u2019s support, gender \ntraining is envisaged for the executing agency and its contractors to prevent issues related to \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the project\u2019s safeguard categories \nare as follows.24 \n \n39.  Environment (category B). The project is category B. It is a transmission system \nexpansion project that will not pass through any ecologically sensitive area and will not cause \n                                                \n24   ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n \n ", "11 \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented.25 \nPGCB prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and government legislation. PGCB and the project team conducted meaningful \nconsultations, with project information disclosed locally and on ADB\u2019s website. The IEE includes \nan environmental management plan for outputs 1 and 2. The project team disclosed the IEE on \nthe ADB website on 12 July 2019. PGCB is committed to implementing the environmental \nmanagement plan under the IEE, and this plan will be sufficient to mitigate potential environmental \nimpacts.  PGCB  and  ADB  agreed  to  closely  monitor  environmental  impacts  during  project \nimplementation and for PGCB to submit environmental monitoring reports to ADB semiannually. \n \n40.  Climate change. The climate change impact of the project is categorized medium. The \nproject team conducted a climate risk vulnerability assessment (CRVA) and incorporated its \nresults into the project design.26 The project\u2019s use of indoor GIS will be its main contribution to \nclimate change adaptation. In addition, the project contributes to climate mitigation by using high-\nefficiency  transmission  lines.  Details  are  in  the  CRVA  (footnote  26)  and  climate  change \nassessment (footnote 19).  \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). PGCB carefully designed the substations and \ntransmission line alignments to minimize land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The \noverhead transmission lines have temporary impacts for crops, and permanent impacts for trees \nand land under four tower legs. Underground lines will follow rights-of-way of existing roads to \navoid creating resettlement impacts. PGCB estimated that the transmission lines will economically \naffect 870 households with a population of 3,828 persons. The project will require about 79.6 \nacres of land acquisition for new substations and existing bay extension; this will affect 281 \nhouseholds and 1,221 people. No physical displacement is required under the project but several \nhouseholds will be significantly affected by losing 10% of their productive assets because of land \nacquisition. PGCB prepared a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and national regulations. PGCB will implement the resettlement plan to ensure that           \n(i)  affected  persons,  including  informal  settlers,  are  compensated  for  lost  assets  prior  to \ndisplacement and at replacement cost; (ii) rehabilitation and restoration programs are in place for \nthose whose livelihood will be affected; (iii) meaningful consultations and timely information \ndisclosure occur; (iv) the standard of living of affected persons is improved to at least national \nminimum standards; and (v) a three-tier grievance redress mechanism is established. If the \nproject scope changes, PGCB will update the resettlement plan accordingly. The project team \ndisclosed the resettlement plan on the ADB website on 15 July 2019. PGCB agreed to closely \nmonitor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  during  project  implementation.  PGCB  has  an \nenvironmental and social unit with staff in charge of resettlement plan implementation. PGCB has \nimplemented several ADB projects and has adequate institutional capacity and experience to \nimplement the resettlement plan. PGCB will hire an external monitor to carry out external \nmonitoring and to verify the implementation status of the resettlement plan. PGCB will submit \nmonitoring reports to ADB semiannually.  \n \n42.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not affect the dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood systems, or culture and territories of indigenous peoples.27 Project due diligence \n                                                \n25  A corrective action plan is included in the environmental audits of existing substations, which defines time-bound \nremedial actions of any noncompliance as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement 2009. \n26  Climate Risk Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27  Indigenous peoples is referred as Tribes, Minor Races, Ethnic Sects and Communities Peoples in Bangladesh.  \n \n ", "12 \nconfirmed that no indigenous peoples, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, were \nfound within the project area.  \n \nF.
