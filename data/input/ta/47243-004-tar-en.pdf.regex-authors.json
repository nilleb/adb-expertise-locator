Bangladesh,  with  a  population  of  about  163  million  in  2016  and  a  land  area  of \n147,570 square kilometers (km), is among the most densely populated countries in the world, and \none of the most vulnerable to climate risk. Two thirds of the country is less than 5 meters above \nmean sea level, in the world\u2019s largest tropical river deltas of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and \nMeghna.  Insufficient  rural  transport,  inadequate  market  infrastructure,  and  climate  change \nimpacts are major constraints to agriculture development. The government\u2019s Seventh Five Year \nPlan, FY2016\u2013FY2020 has put forward strategies to overcome the challenges and constraints to \nagricultural development.1 \n \n2.  Rural connectivity is a key component of rural development in Bangladesh, and road \ntransport is the dominant mode of transport. Rural roads contribute significantly to generating \nincreased agricultural income and employment opportunities, alongside promoting access to \neconomic and social services. In Bangladesh, the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED)  owns  and  maintains  rural  roads.  The  total  road  network  of  Bangladesh  spans \n374,245 km, of which 352,943 km (94%) are rural roads. Many of these roads were constructed \nin 1990\u20132010 on earthen embankments owned by  union parishads (rural councils) or  zila \nparishads (district councils). Since 1995, the government, with the support of the international \ndevelopment community, has continued to expand and improve the rural road network. Despite \nthis, rural connectivity in Bangladesh remains weak, impeding physical and economic access to \ngoods and services. Only about 40% of the rural population has access to all-weather roads and \nonly 28% of the rural roads are paved.  \n \n3.  The proposed project will improve the road network connecting the rural population to \nagriculture value chain development zones, to pave the way for more opportunities to engage in \nagricultural production and agribusiness development. It will improve about 1,700 km of rural \nroads to all-weather standards in 34 districts located in five divisions,2 and enhance the capacity \nof  the  rural  infrastructure  agency  to  address  institutional  constraints  relating  to  rural  road \ndevelopment. It will also finance enhancements to the country\u2019s rural road master plan to enable \nthe selection of priority roads for improvement using a geographic information system covering \nthe entire country.   \n  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will be provided for Institutional \nStrengthening of the Bangladesh Rural Road Sector for Sustainable Development. It will support \nthe  LGED  in  improving  sector  management  performance  by  implementing  institutional \ndevelopment initiatives and bringing in international expertise. The TA will focus on (i) road asset \nmanagement,  including  performance-based  maintenance;  (ii)  road  safety;  and  (iii)  climate-\nresilient design and construction.  \n5.  The large knowledge component is more suited to TA than a loan but will have a significant \npositive impact on current and future investments.  \n                                                \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015.

Output:  Rural  infrastructure  agency  capacity  enhanced.  This  will  consist  of \nimplementing institutional development initiatives to improve the LGED\u2019s sector management \nperformance. International best practices related to institutional and management structures for \nmanaging the overall rural road network will be studied and adopted to strengthen the LGED\u2019s \ncapacity in (i) road asset management (including performance-based maintenance), (ii) road \nsafety, and (iii) climate-resilient design and construction. The TA will  facilitate the LGED\u2019s \nexposure to international practices related to these fields.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.   \n8.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA. It will be implemented over 15 months, and is expected to \nstart on 1 April 2019 and end on 30 June 2020. The LGED in the Local Government Division of \nthe Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives will be the executing \nagency. A Dhaka-based project management unit established within the LGED will support the \nimplementation. The project management unit will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. \n  \n10.

Consulting services. The TA will be implemented over 15 months and will require about \n34 person-months of consulting services (about 17 person-months international and 17 person-\nmonths national) (Table 2). The team of consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) under one package using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. A simplified technical \nproposal will be used for the selection of a firm. Disbursement under the TA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nTable 2: Summary of Consulting Services \nPerson-Months  Person-Months \nNo.  Position and/or Source  (international)  (national) \n1  Team leader along with road asset   9   \nmanagement specialist  \n2  Road safety specialist   4   \n3  Climate-resilient design and  4   \nconstruction specialist  \n4  Road asset management engineer     9 \n5  Road safety engineer     4 \n6  Environment (climate change)    4 \nspecialist  \n  Total person-months  17  17 \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n  1.
