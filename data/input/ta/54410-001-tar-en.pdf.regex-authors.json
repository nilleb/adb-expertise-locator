INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help address gender inequality, \nwhich  impedes  socioeconomic  development  in  ADB  Pacific  DMCs  and  Timor-Leste,  by \nstrengthening the capacity of judicial systems to respond more effectively to violence against \nwomen and girls (VAWG)1 cases, as well as increase knowledge sharing on gender-based \nviolence (GBV) and access to justice issues for women and girls.2 This TA builds on ADB\u2019s work \nwith judicial systems in Pakistan and Afghanistan in handling GBV cases and establishing a model \nGBV court.3 \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priority of accelerating progress in gender \nequality in Asia and the Pacific.4 Specifically, OP 2: Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality, \n2019\u20132024, identifies scaling up support to legal and judicial institutions to promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment.5 The TA also supports OP 6: Strengthening Governance \nand Institutional Capacity, by improving the legal and judicial capacity to enable more effective \ndelivery of services toward achieving inclusive and sustainable growth.6 Moreover, ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach, 2016\u20132020 supports SDG 57 for achieving gender equality and empowering women \nand girls.8 ADB\u2019s Fiji CPS, 2019\u20132023 lists gender equality as a priority, in particular, identifying \nGBV as a barrier to sustained and inclusive growth.9 ADB\u2019s PNG CPS, 2021\u20132025 prioritizes \npreventing GBV as a driver of change in diversifying economic growth and addressing inclusivity \nand building resilience.10 ADB\u2019s Timor-Leste CPS, 2016-2020 acknowledges that women remain \nat high risk of domestic violence.11 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The extent and nature of VAWG are entrenched in all facets of society, including the public \nand private spheres, and come in all forms\u2014physical, sexual, psychological, and economic.12 \nWomen and girls in Pacific DMCs face some of the highest rates of violence globally, with 60%\u2013\n80% of women and girls aged 15\u201349 years experiencing intimate or non-intimate partner violence \nin their lifetime.13 In Timor-Leste, 59% of ever-partnered women aged 15\u201349 years experience \nintimate partner physical and/or sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.14 Furthermore, the \n \n1 VAWG is any act of GBV that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women \nand girls.

This reality for women and girls persists, although VAWG laws have become a focus over \nthe past decade in the Pacific and Timor-Leste. While domestic and family violence was once \nconsidered a private matter, significant legislative enactments have been made in the Pacific \nDMCs to protect women and girls. During the last decade, the Cook Islands, Fiji, the Federated \nStates of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu have put in place laws that criminalize different forms of VAWG, \nserve as a deterrent, and indicate that such behavior is socially unacceptable.16 In Timor-Leste, \nthe Law Against Domestic Violence was enacted in 2010 and under the Criminal Code of 2009, \ndomestic violence is categorized a public crime.17 \n \n5.  Nevertheless, VAWG remains pervasive in the Pacific DMCs and Timor-Leste and survivors \nface harsh realities when seeking protection under the justice system. Evidence suggests that laws \nalone are not enough to eliminate VAWG.18 In addition to laws to combat VAWG, the harmful gender \nbias and stereotyping in the judicial system must be addressed.19 There is lack of understanding or \nmisinterpretation of women and girls\u2019 legal rights, lack of gender sensitivity toward women and girls\u2019 \nlegal rights, harmful gender bias and stereotyping on decision-making, and inadequate institutional \nmechanisms to deal effectively with VAWG cases. \n \n6.  Recent studies have found that gender bias and stereotyping are still prevalent and lead to \nthe denial of justice for survivors, as well as creating future barriers for women and girls\u2019 access to \njustice. For example, a 2016 study that analyzed the judicial sentencing practices from 908 VAWG \ncases in Fiji, Kiribati, PNG, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu found that judges considering \nsentencing  were  affected  by  gender  bias  and  stereotypes,  and took  into  account  mitigating \ncircumstances such as the perpetrator being the breadwinner,20 alleged \u201cprovocation\u201d by the \nsurvivor,21 and participation in customary reconciliation ceremonies22 or compensation, which \ndiscriminate  against  survivors  on  the  basis  of  gender.  The  application  of  these  mitigating \ncircumstances was raised in 75% of the cases examined by the study and was used by the judge \nto justify a sentence reduction in more than 50% of the cases.23 Studies in Timor-Leste show that \nwomen and girls often feel the judicial system ignores their needs and inputs, and rulings are based \non the administrators of justice\u2019s own biases regarding women or girls\u2019 status in society, serving to \nreinforce the social situation.24 Even in cases where convictions are secured, survivors of GBV are \n \n15 UN Women.

Footnote 13. \n21 For example, in State v. Valaibulu (High Court of Fiji, 2017), in issuing the sentence, the magistrate relied on the \nperpetrator\u2019s \u201ceffort at reconciliation,\u201d adding that he believed the perpetrator was \u201cprovoked\u201d by the wife\u2019s behaviour, \nwhich \u201cled to the offence,\u201d and praising the perpetrator for not blaming his wife. \n22 In Kiribati, the customary practice of te kabara bure (a formal apology) makes the crime public and is a disincentive \nfor committing the crime. However, as a male perpetrator can easily regain his standing by practicing kabara bure, \nhe has little to lose. In Samoa, ifoga (a traditional apology) is considered in sentencing perpetrators.  \n23 E. Christie, H. Singh, and J. Singh. 2016.

Consequently, these gender biases and practices in the judicial system result in low \nreporting of crime, traumatization of survivors, failure to investigate or prosecute, barriers to \nachieving a conviction, and reduced and frequent noncustodial sentences for VAWG perpetrators. \nFurthermore, this harmful gender bias and stereotyping produces detrimental case law that may be \nrelied on by future perpetrators and judges. In the Pacific DMCs, it is critical to address gender \nbiases and practices in the judicial system because of the wide discretion in applying customary \nlaws in VAWG cases. For example, in PNG, VAWG case law demonstrates that judges and \nmagistrates frequently consider cultural norms such as reconciliation and victim-blaming, especially \nin village courts.26 \n \n8.  Globally, it has been well-documented that that the judicial system has insufficient capacity \nto address the needs of girls and women survivors of violence. 27 Justice personnel such as \njudges, magistrates, and prosecutors should receive regular and updated training not only on the \nlaws but on all aspects of VAWG, and the issues faced by survivors.28 Studies have shown how \ntraining and capacity development can change practice and improve judicial decision-making. In \nthe Pacific DMCs, it has been reported that judicial officers, when made aware of stereotypes and \nbiases, can and do recognize and reject stereotyping and discriminatory factors in adjudicating \ncases and handing down sentencing decisions.29 For example, at a judges workshop, a former \nFijian High Court judge noted how culturally driven bias affects how women and girls are \nperceived and treated in the courtroom.30 \n \n9.  Moreover, specialized courts and procedures can positively change the way VAWG cases \nare handled.31 Specialized GBV courts provide a stronger possibility that court personnel will be \ngender-sensitive, experienced in the unique characteristics of VAWG cases, and able to process \ncases more quickly, thereby reducing the burden on survivors. Judges who consistently deal with \nVAWG cases may see repeat offenders and can take appropriate action. Even when specialized \ncourts  are  not  created,  implementing  special  measures  for  VAWG  cases,  such  as  court \nprocedures designed to move VAWG cases through the system quickly (fast-tracking), have \nachieved remarkable results.32 To increase access to justice for women and girls living in remote \nareas such as villages or outer islands, the use of specialized mobile courts for adjudicating \nVAWG cases can be explored during the TA needs assessment.33 Mobile courts have helped \n \n25 E.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: increased access to justice to help eliminate \nviolence against women in Pacific DMCs and Timor-Leste (ADB Strategy 2030 OP 2 and OP 6, \nSDGs  5  and  16,  CEDAW).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  gender \nresponsiveness of the judicial system in handling VAWG cases.35 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1:  Strengthened capacity of judicial systems in responding to violence \nagainst women and girls cases. This output will conduct an assessment of the current VAWG \nlegal framework, institutional mechanisms, and capacity to address VAWG issues within the \njudicial systems; and produce a report with recommendations to the implementing agencies. \nBased on the assessment recommendations, and in consultation with the implementing agencies, \nthis  output  will  (i)  develop  and  deliver  customized  capacity  building  programs  for  judges, \nmagistrates, and prosecutors36 on gender sensitization and VAWG laws and procedures, as well \nas a review of the jurisprudence on VAWG cases, international conventions, legal principles, and \nstandards relating to the procedural and substantive rights of women and girls, to aid in judicial \ndecision-making and effective judgment writing for VAWG cases; and (ii) develop tools such as \nbench books, handbooks, protocols, and/or guidelines on handling VAWG cases.37 Under this \noutput, recommendations can be provided on specialized mechanisms such as a dedicated GBV \ncourt, a judicial certification program for a group of specialized judges to handle VAWG cases, \nand/or special court procedures to provide for more effective and faster adjudication of VAWG \ncases. Upon request, the TA can assist in integrating or establishing special mechanisms in the \njudicial system of the participating DMC.38 \n \n12.  Output 2:  Increased regional knowledge on gender-based violence issues. This \noutput will (i) convene regional knowledge sharing events on GBV and access to justice issues; \nand (ii) produce publications on GBV and/or VAWG cases and access to justice issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,225,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 and TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n   \n \n34 Development partners such as the United Nations Development Programme and the American Bar Association have \nsupported mobile courts in Africa, and relevant lessons can be considered for Pacific and Timor-Leste contexts. \nUNDP. 2014.
