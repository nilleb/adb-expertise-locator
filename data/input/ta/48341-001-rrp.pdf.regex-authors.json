I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ninvestment of up to Rs 2,170,000,000 in Drashti Developers Private Limited (DDPL) for the \nShapoorji Affordable Housing Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n  \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  India suffers from an acute national shortage of housing, estimated at 76 million dwelling \nunits  in  20091 including all  income segments. The  urban  shortage  was  about  18.8  million \ndwelling units at the end of 2012.2 Due to the lack of housing in urban areas, many people live \nin  inadequate  conditions  and  slums  have  proliferated  across  the  country.  In  Mumbai,  for \ninstance, about 53% of the population lives in slums; however, officially, only 15% are identified \nas the real poor. This led industry experts to comment that even the middle class is having \ndifficulty finding housing that is not in slums or substandard conditions.3 Increasing urbanization \nfrom 28% in 2001 to 40% by 2030,4 nuclearization of families, positive demographics (more than \n50% of the population is under 25 years of age), and rising incomes will increase demand for \nurban housing. Increased infrastructure development is improving connectivity  within cities, \nallowing  workers  to  live  further  away  from  their  jobs  at  more  suburban  locations.  The \ncombination  of  high  demand  and  relatively  low  organized  supply,  as  well  as  new  policy \ninitiatives allowing foreign direct investment in real estate are contributing to the interest of \nreputed developers to enter the lower price segment. \n \n3.  Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited (SPCPL or the sponsor) approached the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  invest  in  a  housing  platform  to  develop  a  portfolio  of \naffordable housing projects. The project is considered to be one of the best opportunities for \nADB to support affordable housing in India because of its high development impact and its \nstrong and experienced sponsor. SPCPL is one of the first large, well-reputed developers to \nmove into the affordable housing market with a structured approach.  \n  \n2.  Project Design \n \n4.  The  sponsor,  SPCPL,  has  incorporated  DDPL  as  the  entity  under  which  all  future \naffordable  housing  projects  under  the  Shapoorji  brand  will  be  developed.  The  proposed \ntransaction  will  make  an  equity  investment  in  DDPL,  which  is  expected  to  construct \napproximately 20,000 affordable housing units. The project will provide affordable housing for \nfamilies in the upper part of the lower income group and the middle-income group segment\u2014\ntargeting working class, salaried, service sector households. These households are expected to \nbe able to obtain a long-term mortgage from commercial banks and housing finance institutions \nthat will partner with SPCPL ahead of project launch.  \n                                                \n1  Credit Rating Information Services of India Limited Research. 2009.

The definition of affordable housing differs around the world, although a commonly \naccepted guideline is that cost of housing should not exceed 40% of a household\u2019s gross \nincome. Income, size of dwelling, and affordability are three key parameters used to define \naffordable housing. KPMG and Knight Frank, an international property consultant, have outlined \na useful affordable housing definition in India (Table 1).5 Affordable housing is distinct from the \nIndian high-end real estate market, which recently experienced a boom. Affordable housing is a \nlow-margin (but stable), mass-market business with an estimated market size of Rs3 trillion  \n($50 billion) in India\u2019s seven largest cities alone (footnote 5). A key factor that determines \nfinancial success of the affordable housing segment is low overall cost, which includes (i) low \ncost of land, (ii) low construction cost, (iii) efficient implementation of construction, (iv) access to \nlow-cost  capital,  (v)  innovative  marketing  skills,  (vi)  dedicated  organizational  focus,  and  \n(vii) good government relations to obtain all required licenses in a timely manner. \n \nTable 1: Defining Affordable Housing \n  Income Level  Size of Dwelling Unit  Affordability \nEWS  <INR 150,000 per annum  Up to 300 ft2  \n(< $ 2,444 per annum) \nINR 150,000 to 300,000 per  Monthly Installment to Monthly Income \nLIG  annum  300 to 600 ft2   \u2022 30 to 40 percent \n($2,444 - $4,889 per annum)  House Price to Annual Income Ratio \nINR 300,000 to 1,000,000 per  \u2022 Less than 5.1  \nMIG  annum  600 to 1200 ft2  \n($4,889 -$16,287 per annum) \n  EWS = economically weaker section, LIG = low income group, MIG = middle income group \n  Source: KPMG advisory 2010. \n \n6.  The project will draw on the extensive construction experience of SPCPL and other \nShapoorji Pallonji Group (SPG) companies, which have a presence across the construction \nvalue chain.. The projects will be located in suburban locations of preselected cities, have clear \ngrowth  potential,  and  are  carefully  selected  based  on  a  well-defined  geographic  strategy. \nAmenities will include standard sanitation, adequate water and power supply, and provision of \ncommunity spaces. They could include amenities such as parks, schools, and health-care \nfacilities, where applicable.  \n \n3.  The Sponsor \n \n7.  Established in 1865, SPG is one of the oldest and most reputable conglomerates in India \nwith presence across construction, real estate, infrastructure, and water, with a total annual \nturnover of $2.5 billion. As part of SPG, SPCPL is one of the leading real estate companies in \nIndia with a pan-India portfolio of residential and commercial developments, and experience in \naffordable housing. SPCPL has constructed landmark buildings, such as the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (1952), the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel (1903), and the Imperial Towers in Mumbai (2010), \nwhich  are  the  tallest  buildings  in  India  to  date.  SPCPL  has  also  constructed  international \nlandmark buildings in the Middle East and Africa, such as the Palace of the Sultan in Oman and \nthe Seat of Government in Ghana. SPCPL is the developer and contractor of the Shukhobrishti \nproject in Kolkata, which is one of the largest mass, affordable housing projects in India to date \nand  is  being  developed  for  the  government  of  West  Bengal  based  on  a  Public  Private \nPartnership. Spread over 61 hectares, about 20,000 units are being constructed in one single \nlocation for lower, middle, and upper-middle-income households.  \n                                                \n5  KPMG. 2010. Affordable Housing\u2013A Key Growth Driver in the Real Estate Sector? Mumbai. ", "  3 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n8.  The direct impact of the project is to increase private sector investment in affordable \nhousing. It supports poverty reduction and inclusive growth by generating employment and \nimproves  housing  availability  and  quality.  Access  to  adequate  housing  improves  health \nconditions, but also reduces stress and improves security, especially for children and women. At \nthe same time, housing provides a place of employment for micro and small businesses and \ncan be used as collateral to secure a loan.6 \n   \n2.  Outcome \n \n9.  The outcome of the project is improved access to affordable, available and quality \nhousing for target households in urban India. The shortage of housing in urban centers will be \npartially addressed by the construction of additional units. This will be measured through the \nnumber of units sold to end consumers and ownership deeds transferred.  \n \n3.  Outputs \n \n10.   The  project\u2019s  outputs  will  be  the  construction  of  approximately  20,000  affordable \nresidential  housing  units,  to  be  built  to  the  extent  possible  according  to  green  building \nprinciples.7 The project is expected to create approximately 9,000 temporary unskilled and \nsemiskilled direct jobs during project construction. Locally purchased goods and services are \nexpected to contribute approximately $640 million to the local economy. Construction is a large \ncontributor to employment, particularly in the form of semiskilled and unskilled jobs for lower \nincome groups. According to an ADB study, Rs1 million invested in construction creates (direct \nand indirectly) 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled and semiskilled, and 9,000 managerial and \ntechnical person-days of employment in India (footnote 6). Environmental and social standards \nof the developer will be implemented at each subproject.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n \n11.  The project will promote private sector development, one of the pillars of Strategy 2020 \nand its midterm review, in the affordable housing segment.8 The government has traditionally \nsupported this part of the real estate sector, which has historically not seen much interest from \nthe private sector. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 also calls for sharpening the focus of \nADB operations on inclusive economic growth, which is addressed through the spin-off effects \nof construction.9 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017 notes that housing \nfinance, and physical and social infrastructure development will be supported.10 The project \n                                                \n6 ADB.  2013.

Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n \n12.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan to increase private sector \ninvolvement in the urban sector.13 By constructing affordable housing units that provide better \nliving conditions, the project will help to improve urban quality of life, which is the main objective \nof ADB\u2019s urban sector operations in India. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n15.  Long-term  funding  for  the  real  estate  sector,  particularly  for  the  affordable  housing \nsegment, is not readily available in the Indian market due to limited risk appetite and commercial \nbank\u2019s limits to the sector which have been largely used for the high-end real estate market. \nADB\u2019s investment will be catalytic as it allows SPCPL to launch a sizeable and sustainable \nhousing platform for affordable housing, an area that needs quality sponsors to build low-cost, \ngood quality housing stock. To date this segment is largely characterized by small unorganized \nparticipants with limited capacity. The construction of housing supply affordable to the middle \nclass will free up housing stock for people who currently live in substandard conditions but are \nunable to move out due to a lack of available options. The project will play a pioneering role in \ndemonstrating  the  commercial  viability  of  affordable  housing  projects  undertaken  without \ngovernment subsidies.  \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n16.  Sponsor  risk.  The  real  estate  sector  in  India  is  plagued  by  delays  and \nunderperformance due to the limited financial and operating capacity of developers. SPCPL has \nample experience as a real estate developer and construction contractor, having delivered \nmultiple  landmark  buildings.  SPCPL  is  the  developer  and  engineering,  procurement,  and \nconstruction contractor of the Shukhobrishti project in Kolkata, which is one of the largest mass \nhousing projects in India to date.  \n \n17.  Project implementation risk. Real estate projects are prone to construction delays and \ncost overruns. Construction of the subprojects will be done by SPCPL, one of India\u2019s most \nreputable and leading construction companies. Projects will be undertaken in a phased manner \nand are scalable, as the project will comprise multiple independent towers. If market demand \ndictates a smaller development, fewer towers can be constructed, reducing the capital outlay \nand the risk of cost overruns. Increased construction costs are generally absorbed by sales \nprice escalations for units sold in later stages of the development. \n  \n18.  Market risk. The transaction is exposed to underlying real estate risk of the projects (in \nterms of cost, schedule, unit sales, and financing) which, if materialized would result in lower \nsales proceeds than planned. By providing financing at a corporate level, ADB is able to invest \nin affordable housing on a portfolio basis, mitigating the geographic real estate concentration \nrisk of a single project location.  \n \n19.  Government support. Reliance on government for provision of basic infrastructure and \npublic transport creates a risk that project sites might not be sufficiently connected or will \nencounter connection delays. Sites will be carefully selected on the (near) availability of such \ntrunk infrastructure and connectivity services in order to mitigate against connection delays.  \n \n20.  Permitting risk. The real estate sector has seen significant delays over the past few \nyears due to the increased number of permits required and the lengthy processes involved, \nwhich can contribute to high cost overruns. Several Indian cities have started implementing an \nautomated system for approving building plans. SPCPL\u2019s proven track record, good reputation, \nand ongoing relationship with authorities should mitigate permitting delays.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "6 \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions  \n \n21.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts. The potential environmental and social impacts were identified and effective measures \nto avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated in the \nsafeguard  reports  and  plans.  To  assess  compliance  with  the  safeguard  requirements  for \nindividual projects, DDPL will establish and maintain an environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS), to screen, assess, and address environmental and social impacts and risks. \nThe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  DDPL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n \n22.   Sites  within  the  municipal  boundaries  of  the  metropolitan  areas,  subject  to  a \ndevelopment  control  plan  and  zoned  for  residential  development,  will  be  considered  for \ndevelopment  of  housing  projects  by  DDPL.  No  significant  environmental  disturbances  are \nanticipated  as  the  screening  criteria  for  site  selection  will  avoid  areas  in  the  vicinity  of \nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Typical construction impacts such as vegetation clearance, \nstorm-water management, dust, noise, and solid and liquid waste generation will occur apart \nfrom an increase in local traffic due to operation of construction vehicles and equipment on site. \nNo involuntary resettlement impacts are expected as DDPL will acquire already aggregated \nlands, free of land disputes or encumbrances, from (i) lands already owned by SPG in the \nmetropolitan  cities,  (ii) a  network  of reputed  land  aggregators  and  realtors  with  access  to \nsuitable  lands,  and  (iii)  international  property  consultants  and  reputed  brokers.  DDPL  will \nperform due diligence of the process for all land procurement, and address any residual impacts \non affected persons in line with ADB safeguard requirements. Impacts on indigenous peoples \nare not expected as there is no likelihood of concentrations of scheduled tribes occupying or \nutilizing the sites within the metropolitan cities. Each project will undergo an initial environmental \nexamination and a social safeguards compliance due diligence as per the DDPL ESMS. \n \n23.  A corporate audit was conducted on SPCPL\u2019s existing environment and social policy and \nprocedures.  The  audit  identified  corrective  actions  required  to  ensure  compliance  of  the \nprocedures  with  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  The  corrective  actions  were \ndiscussed and agreed upon with SPCPL. DDPL commits to implement the corrective actions \nproposed  and  to  have  in  place  a  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  compliant  ESMS,  which  is \nsatisfactory to ADB, prior to first disbursement. DDPL will submit annual monitoring reports on \nthe implementation of its ESMS and the subprojects. \n \n24.   The project gender category is some gender elements. Measures to benefit women or \nfacilitate their involvement in construction and operation of the project are incorporated in the \nproject design in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). DDPL will \ncomply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB's Social Protection Strategy (2001), will \ntake measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards.14  The client \nwill report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance with such laws and (ii) the \nmeasures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  will  be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2003.

DDPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n26.  The proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n27.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 15  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of India has no objection to the proposed assistance to DDPL. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval \nof the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the investment \nof up to Rs 2,170,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in Drashti Developers Private \nLimited for the Shapoorji Affordable Housing Project in India, with such terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n11 June 2015  \n                                                \n15  ADB. 1966.
