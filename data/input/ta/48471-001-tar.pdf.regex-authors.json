INTRODUCTION  \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Study  on  Building  an \nEcological Security System for the National Core Grain Growing Area of Henan Province. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC.1 A TA \nreconnaissance mission was conducted from 27 to 29 July 2015.2 Government concurrence \nwith the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference was obtained. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Henan Province and the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang are the three core grain \nproducing regions of the PRC and are considered by the government to be the three most \nimportant contributors to the country\u2019s food security. Henan covers a large part of the fertile \nNorth China Plain and has a total cropping area of 8,156,760 hectares. It is the nation's largest \nwheat and sesame producer and the second biggest producer of corn. It also produces a \nsubstantial share of the country\u2019s rice crop.3 Despite its importance and current high productivity, \nagriculture in Henan has been negatively affected by an intensification of agriculture practices. \nThis  has  led  to  declining  soil  fertility,  soil  erosion,  and  land  degradation  and  an  overall \ndeterioration in the environmental quality of its cropping areas. These worsening ecological \nconditions make it difficult for Henan to sustain its grain production and keep the province\u2019s crop \nproductivity at the high levels required to meet the PRC\u2019s grain needs. The quality of the \ncropping ecosystem in Henan must be improved so that the province can continue to produce \ngrain sustainably and fulfill its highly important obligations in maintaining national food security.  \n \n3.  The ecology and productivity of cropping areas are strongly linked. Healthy ecosystems \ncan support and promote crop production systems that are sustainable and have high yields. \nAgroforestry systems are a common feature in regions that have extensive areas devoted to \ngrain cropping. Agroforestry involves the cultivation of crops in close proximity and association \nwith trees or shrubs. This brings ecological and economic benefits as it has been shown to \nimprove  crop  yields  and  soil  fertility,  reduce  soil  erosion,  conserve  soil  moisture,  recycle \nnutrients, protect crops from provide wind and storms, sequester carbon from the atmosphere, \nand increase biodiversity. \n \n4.   Agroforestry in Henan was traditionally characterized by the use of intercropping, alley \ncropping,  and  shelterbelt  systems  to  protect  crops,  soil,  and  the  ecosystem.  Intercropping \nsystems grow trees or shrubs among crops. Alley cropping alternates rows of closely spaced \ntree or hedge species with crop strips, and shelterbelt systems grow trees and shrubs around \nthe crops. Now, however, these systems have been severely degraded or completely lost \nthrough  more  intensive  agricultural  practices,  greater  mechanization,  and  poor  system \nmaintenance and management.  \n \n5.   Henan has done significant work to reforest its upland and mountainous areas but has \npaid little attention to the lowland cropping areas or support for agroforestry systems. The \nprovince\u2019s agroforestry systems need to be reestablished to protect the grain growing areas and \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 July 2015.  \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Henan Department of Statistics. 2015. Henan Provincial Statistical \nYearbook 2014. Zhengzhou. \n ", "2   \npromote ecological security. This will improve the grain cropping ecosystem and ensure national \nfood security by restoring soil fertility and proper conservation. Although agroforestry was a \ntraditional practice in Henan, most of the knowledge and skills needed to set up, maintain, and \nmanage  these  systems  have  been  lost.  Farmers  need  to  be  made  more  aware  of  the \nimportance of such systems, their benefits, and the technical skills needed to manage them. \nGovernment  institutions  and  policies  need  to  be  strengthened  to  enable  more  support  for \nagroforestry  actions.  Because  it  involves  both  the  agriculture  and  forestry  sectors  in  its \nmanagement and upkeep,  agroforestry struggles to compete with  conflicting  demands and \npriorities in government that fall entirely within these sectors. The Henan Provincial Forestry \nDepartment (HPFD) needs a development framework that can promote the development of \nagroforestry. This framework should include policy support and a financing plan for agroforestry \nactivities. \n \n6.  Government policy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. This TA will support the \ngovernment\u2019s aims to stabilize grain production in Henan to maintain national food security and \nto  promote  the  sustainable  use  of  the  country\u2019s  land  and  forests.  These  are  to  be  key \ndevelopment priorities in the PRC\u2019s thirteenth five-year plan for 2016\u20132020, currently being \nprepared. The TA also supports the PRC government\u2019s policy adopted in 2012 to build an \n\u201cecological civilization\u201d.4 The government aims to build an ecological security system that can \nsafeguard  the  grain  production  bases.  Combining  investment  in  rural  sector  with  public \nparticipation will improve the urban and rural environments, which is part of the government\u2019s \n\u201cecological civilization\u201d development agenda. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s priorities in its country \npartnership strategy for the PRC for 2016\u20132020, which is currently being prepared, and in the \nADB operational plan for sustainable food security.5 In both cases, ADB aims to support greater \nagricultural  productivity  and  enhance  the  quantity,  quality,  and  management  of  natural \nresources. \n \n7.  ADB had previous experience in agroforestry through a project financed by a grant from \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to develop a sustainable agroforestry land-use system in \nthe northern region of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.6 Another project relevant to this \nTA is the Jiangsu Yancheng Wetlands Protection Project in the PRC, which proposes two \nagroforestry  intercropping  models  combining  forest  and  medicinal  plants  and  forest  and \nmelons.7 The outputs from this TA will be relevant to all of the PRC\u2019s cropping areas, particularly \nthose in the other two major grain growing regions in Heilongjiang and Jilin. The ecological \nsecurity of both of these provinces could benefit from the example of an improvement of the \nagroforestry systems in Henan. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA impact will be an increased contribution by Henan\u2019s grain production systems to \nnational food security. The intended outcome is an improvement in the ecosystem of the core \ngrain cropping region of Henan.  \n \n                                                \n4  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2015.

The TA project\u2019s three outputs will be (i) the recommendation of best practices in the \ntechnical  management  of  agroforestry,  (ii)  the  drafting  of  a  strategy  for  agroforestry \ndevelopment, and (iii) the enhancement of capacity of the government and communities to \nimplement agroforestry activities.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Best practices in technical management of agroforestry recommended. \nTechnical assessments will be conducted under output 1 that will include a review of current \nenvironmental and socioeconomic data; land use and land development plans of the project \narea;  impact  of  climate  change  on  production  systems;  current  management  practices  in \nHenan\u2019s grain production and agroforestry systems; the identification of hazards and threats to \ngrain production; and national and international best practices in agroforestry that have been \nintegrated into grain production. Consultations with communities and farmers will be a key part \nof  these  assessments.  The  TA  will  determine  the  attitudes  and  preferences  in  regard  to \nintegrating agroforestry systems into current cropping practices, their willingness to do so, and \nany constraints they will face. These technical assessments will identify the main constraints on \nand opportunities for better grain production. They will also assess how agroforestry systems \nand the integration of national and international best practices can be used to overcome these \nconstraints,  mitigate  other  risks  to  production,  and  enhance  ecological  security.  The \nrecommendations of improved agroforestry practices and system models will include financial \nanalyses of the potential implementation costs and financial benefits.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Strategy for agroforestry development drafted. The TA will support an \nanalysis of the current institutional, policy, and regulation setting for implementing agroforestry \nprojects. It will also help determine how this setting can be improved to encourage the increased \nuse and sound maintenance of existing agroforestry systems in core grain growing areas and \nthe establishment and proper maintenance of new ones. The review will look at agriculture and \nforestry  issues.  It  will  examine  current  national  eco-compensation  programs,  policies,  and \nregulations that promote the provision of ecosystem services and assess the opportunities to \ngain financial benefits and support from such programs to provide ecosystem services through \nagroforestry  systems.  The  TA  will  also  make  recommendations  for  improved  agroforestry \nmanagement policies and regulations based on the technical and financial analyses from output \n1, as well as the institutional or policy and eco-compensation assessment. After consultations \nbetween  government  agencies,  a  draft  strategic  agroforestry  development  plan  will  outline \nmanagement mechanisms for the agroforestry sector. The plan details will include the financing \nrequired to implement it, as well as the sources of this financing.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Government  and  community  capacity  to  implement  agroforestry \nactivities  enhanced.  The project will build government and community ability to carry out \nagroforestry  activities  by  developing  a  training  program  and  delivering  training  to  forestry \nextension agents. It will use the training-of-trainers approach, as well as awareness-raising \nactivities  involving  communities  and  agroforestry  enterprises.8 A  strengths,  weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats analysis will be conducted on extension services and their capacity to \nprovide training to farmers and enterprises. The TA will develop training materials and provide \ntraining to forestry and agriculture extension staff and community leaders who will play a role in \nproviding extension services to villagers and agroforestry enterprises. The project will include an \ninternational study tour that will demonstrate the current best practices in the integration of \n                                                \n8  The training-of-trainers approach improves the skills of the professionals responsible for providing training or in a \nposition where they could provide training. It not only enhances the technical skills of the people who will give the \ntraining but also provides them with an improved understanding of the concepts, skills, and methods of teaching \nand learning and of how these can be applied to various types of training events. \n ", "4   \nagroforestry and grain production. An agroforestry knowledge product will be produced on the \nagroforestry opportunities and issues identified during the output 1 and 2 activities. \n \n13.   Capacity strengthening under the TA will build an important foundation for expanding \nagroforestry in Henan\u2019s grain growing areas. It will include development of the new training \nmaterials,  the  training-of-trainers  program,  and  the  provision  of  equipment  (computers, \nprojectors, cameras, printed resource, and training materials). The provincial, municipal, county, \nand village extension and forestry officers who will be trained will then be responsible for \ntraining  and  providing  extension  support  to  farmers,  private  enterprises,  and  state-owned \nenterprises. This will raise awareness about the benefits of agroforestry systems, the improved \nagroforestry models, and agroforestry maintenance and management practices. The project will \nprovide these trainers with basic equipment such as computers and printers that they need to \ncarry out this training.  \n \n14.  The TA project design assumes that (i) sufficient willingness to cooperate exists between \ncommunity members and local government institutions; (ii) local communities and the private \nsector will be interested in receiving agroforestry training; and (iii) they will be willing to invest in \nagroforestry systems, with or without the support of national subsidies.  \n \n15.  Risks  include  the  possibility  that  the  data  required  for  the  assessment  will  not  be \navailable. In addition, communities in the core grain producing areas may not want to invest in \nagroforestry shelterbelts. Policy conflicts and competition between agencies could arise within \ngovernment over land use, which could affect the preparation of the agroforestry development \nstrategy. The most differences most likely to emerge would be between government policies \nand agency views regarding grain production versus ecological conservation. Some of the \nvarious government departments involved in the project activities may be unable to reach a \nconsensus  on  the  strategies  and  policy  framework  required  to  implement  the  envisaged \nagroforestry expansion.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of the remuneration and travel expenses of counterpart \nstaff (including a translator), local transport for consultants to government offices in Zhengzhou \n(the capital of Henan), provision of available relevant government data and studies for the TA \nconsultants\u2019 use, meeting rooms, office facilities, geographic information system maps, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The HPFD will be the executing agency. The provincial project office of the HPFD will be \nthe implementing agency. The director of the provincial project office will be responsible for \ncoordinating operational matters and technical collaboration with the consultants. The HPFD will \nprovide office space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical support for TA \nimplementation.  The  director  of  the  provincial  project  office  will  also  be  responsible  for \nsubmitting reimbursement claims for approved expenditures for logistical support for training, \nseminars, and conferences. \n \n18.  The HPFD will convene meetings and workshops during the inception, interim, and final \nstages of TA implementation for the offices and departments concerned, including the national \nand provincial departments of agriculture, forestry, and water resources.  \n \n ", "  5 \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 16 months\u2014tentatively, from 1 November 2015 to 28 \nFebruary 2017. The consultants will submit an inception report to ADB within 2 months of start-\nup and an interim report 5 months into implementation. They will submit a draft final report to \nADB 10 months after the TA begins and a final report at conclusion. The inception, interim, and \ndraft final reports will be subject to review by ADB and the government. All reports will be written \nin English and translated into Chinese. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n20.  A consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the simplified technical proposal and \nquality- and cost-based selection method. The quality\u2013cost ratio will be 90:10 due to the high \ntechnical complexity of the consulting assignment. The TA will require 21 person-months of \nconsulting services (3 person-months of international and 18 person-months of national inputs). \nThe consulting team will consist of an international agroforestry management specialist, who will \nbe the team leader. The team will have six national specialists\u2014an  ecology specialist who will \nbe  deputy team leader, a forestry planning specialist, an institutional and policy specialist, a \nclimate  change  specialist,  a  finance  specialist,  and  a  training  and  extension  specialist. \nProcurement of equipment will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  Resource  persons  may  be  recruited  to  review  the  consultants\u2019  outputs  and  share \nknowledge  during  workshops  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  recruiting  and \nadministering resource persons. \n \n21.  The TA results will be disseminated through the release of the project reports, as well as \nthrough workshops and media releases by ADB and the HPFD. The training program will be \nbased on the TA assessment results to ensure that information on the training needs is up-to-\ndate and that the technical expertise required is provided in the training. A knowledge product \nwill be developed and disseminated in hard copies by ADB, the resident mission in the PRC, \nand the HPFD. It will be posted on the ADB website. Evaluation of the TA outcome will follow \nADB guidelines and be provided to the HPFD. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on Building an Ecological \nSecurity System for the National Core Grain Growing Area of Henan Province, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nThe contribution of grain production systems in Henan Province to national food security in the PRC is \nincreased (Henan Provincial Grain Production Core Region Plan, 2008\u20132020) \n \n    Performance Indicators     \nProject Results  with Targets and  Data Sources and   \nChain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2017     \n       \nThe ecosystem of  a.
