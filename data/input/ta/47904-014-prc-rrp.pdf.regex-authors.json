I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfacility of up to $240 million equivalent without government guarantee to Beijing Enterprises \nWater Group Limited (BEWG) and BEWG Environmental Group Company Limited. (BEGC), \ncomprising  (i)  an  A-loan  of  up  to  $120  million  equivalent  in  dollars  and  yuan,  and  (ii) a \ncomplementary loan of up to $120 million equivalent in dollars and yuan for the Wastewater \nTreatment  and  Reuse  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  This  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Climate Change Fund1, and \nthe Multi-Donor Trust Fund2 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification   \n2.  With rapid urbanization, the PRC has been encountering water challenges. More than \n400 cities report water shortages, with an average daily shortfall of 16 million cubic meters. Per \ncapita freshwater resources in the PRC are scarce at about 2,200 cubic meters versus the \nglobal  average  of  9,200  cubic  meters.  Annual  per  capita  water  endowments  have  been \ndeclining at an alarming rate, and are expected to decline by an additional 10% by 2025. \nExtensive water pollution further reduces availability of freshwater. In 2012, 31% of 10 major \nriver systems and 39% of 62 primary lakes could not fulfill the water quality requirement for \ndrinking water. The quality of as much as 57% of the total national groundwater is classified \n\u201cbad\u201d or \u201cvery bad.\u201d3 Public health consequences are significantly affecting lives, livelihoods, \nand productivity.  \n \n3.  In  response,  integrated  water  management  has  been  a  focus  area  of  business \ndevelopment efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The successful implementation of \nthe ADB TA by ADB\u2019s East Asia Department highlighted strategic wastewater management and \nreuse.4  Wastewater, if properly treated, can effectively reduce pollution and become a new \nreliable source to address water scarcity. With adequate technologies, wastewater can be \ntreated to meet specific needs and purposes, such as industry use, including machine cooling, \ncleansing, and boiler operation. More freshwater can be allocated for uses that require higher \nquality, such as for drinking, thereby contributing to more sustainable resource allocation. It is \nalso a more efficient option to address water needs in areas with growing water consumption, \nboth on a per capita and total basis, without adding new infrastructure for a freshwater treatment \nfacility.  \n \n4.  Through  the  continuous  wastewater  reuse  project  screening  and  discussion  with \nstakeholders, the project team identified that BEWG, an integrated water infrastructure operator, \n                                                \n1  Established by ADB.   \n2  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland.   \n3  Ministry of Environmental Protection, People\u2019s Republic of China. 2013.

", "2 \nas  having  an  innovative  business  model  that  could  embody  this  new  direction.  BEWG \nacknowledged ADB\u2019s recent international syndication for the PRC Municipal Water Distribution \nInfrastructure Development Project,5 and requested ADB to take the lead in arranging a dual-\ncurrency financing package, relying on ADB structuring skills.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n5.  The  project  is  designed  as  the  least-cost  solution  to  facilitate  reuse  of  treated \nwastewater by upgrading multiple wastewater treatment plants to meet grade 1A standard. The \ntreated wastewater can then be reused for industry cooling and urban environment purposes. \nThe project involves the acquisition, upgrade and/or expansion, and operation of wastewater \ntreatment plants with technology options for meeting reuse water quality for up to 1.8 million \ntons per day during 2014\u20132016. In municipalities that do not yet have appropriate associated \ninfrastructure for wastewater reuse, BEWG will first upgrade wastewater treatment facilities to \nmeet the water quality standards for reuse before any actual sales of the treated wastewater.  \n \n3.  The Borrowers and Sponsor  \n6.  The project will have two borrowers: BEWG for the dollars and off-shore yuan tranche \nand BEGC, a PRC holding company wholly owned by BEWG, for the on-shore yuan tranche.  \n \n7.  BEWG, the sponsor and the primary borrower, is a holding company incorporated in \nBermuda and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. At the end 2012, 44.1% of BEWG \nshares were held by Beijing Enterprises Holdings Limited, which is in turn majority owned by \nBeijing Enterprises Group Company Limited. BEWG differentiates itself from its peers through \nits strong focus on comprehensive solutions to integrated water management with advanced \ntechnology, wastewater treatment in particular. As of 2012, BEWG owned concessions in about \n90 cities and counties in 19 provinces. It operated 83 wastewater treatment plants, 21 water \nsupply plants, and one seawater desalination plant with total design capacity of 7.3 million tons \nper day. ADB\u2019s review of BEWG does not give ADB cause to believe that this entity has been \nestablished, or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism \nfinancing in the jurisdictions involved in the project.6 \n \n8.  BEGC, the second borrower, is incorporated in the PRC as an on-shore investment \nplatform to own the wastewater treatment and reuse project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n9.  Wastewater  treatment,  BEWG\u2019s  core  business,  contributed  approximately  52%  of \nBEWG profit in 2012. BEWG is a pioneer in reuse of treated wastewater and has implemented \nfour projects with 499,500 tons per day in total in cities with low natural water resources and \nhigh  water  utilization.7 Since  its  incorporation  in  2008,  BEWG\u2019s  operating  and  financial \nperformance has improved steadily. As of 2012, BEWG reported pre-tax profits of HK$1,092 \n                                                \n5  ADB and 18 banks signed a $100 million B-loan on 1 February 2013 to China Water Affairs Group. \n6 Bermuda is on the \u201cwhite list\u201d of OECD jurisdictions which have substantially implemented the internationally \n \nagreed tax standard. The Global Forum is conducting a peer review process that examines the legal and regulatory \nframework of member jurisdictions (Phase 1 reviews). Bermuda has passed its Phase 1 review, and therefore has \nqualified to pass on to its Phase 2 review (which is of the actual implementation of the internationally agreed tax \nstandard). \n7  Beijing, Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong provinces.

BEWG\u2019s strategy is to focus on acquiring small- to medium-sized plants and improve \ntheir operating performance to meet the best water quality standard. Technologies employed \nare the anaerobic\u2013oxic activated sludge process or anaerobic\u2013anoxic\u2013oxic activated sludge \nprocess, with advanced treatment for reuse.8 BEWG is responsible for identifying, evaluating, \nselecting, negotiating, implementing, and administering the project companies.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n11.  The anticipated project impact includes (i) enhanced urban environment and reduced \npollution, (ii) sustainable source of water for industry and urban environment use, and (iii) \nincreased private sector investment in wastewater management.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n12.  The project is expected to improve the quality of treated wastewater in the PRC. It will \nincrease the capacity to treat effluents, and the water will be enhanced to a higher standard.  \n \n3.  Outputs \n13.  The project output is the installation and operation of wastewater treatment and reuse \nplants with total capacity of up to 1.8 million tons per day. Other socioeconomic benefits, \ncaptured in the design and monitoring framework, include job creation in local communities.9  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n14.  The project is fully consistent with Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and \nenvironment as two of the five core focus areas for ADB operations.10 For infrastructure, the \nproject is in line with the strategy\u2019s urban infrastructure focus on water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste,  as  well  as  its  emphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnership  and  livable  cities.  For  the \nenvironment,  the  project  mitigates  water  pollution  and  health  threats,  and  promotes  the \nconservation of natural resources. \n \n15.  By  supporting  inclusive  growth  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  project  directly \naddresses two of the three development goals of the PRC country partnership strategy and \naligns with the strategy\u2019s affirmation of natural resources and urban development as priority \n                                                \n8  The advanced treatment processes include biological aeration filter, baffled reactor, inclined tube setting, and \nuniform media filter tank.  \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10  ADB. 2008.

The  project  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy,  which  emphasizes  integrated  water \nmanagement, water conservation, and system efficiencies.12 ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, \n2011\u20132020 identifies wastewater management and private sector participation as two of three \npriority areas. 13 The project is an example of the type of intervention envisaged by the plan, \nwhich promotes water as a core investment area and sustains ADB\u2019s water investments to a \ntotal of $20 billion\u2013$25 billion during the period 2011\u20132020.  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n17.  BEWG\u2019s  investment  plan  indicates  a  total  investment  of  $480  million  equivalent, \nincluding civil works, equipment and materials, other local procurement, and working capital \nduring 2014\u20132016.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  Each project company will be awarded a concession of 25\u201330 years with tariffs for \nwastewater treatment and reuse governed by the national cost\u2013plus regulations \nand  the  minimum  volume  guarantee.  Each  project  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with granted approvals, and during construction and operation will be \nsubject to government inspections of various aspects, including environment, land \nacquisition, involuntary resettlement, ethnic minorities, labor, safety, quality, and \nsanitation. Inflow and outflow volumes and water quality will be monitored in all the \nsubprojects.  \nManagement  BEWG will centrally control all project development, procurement, and financing \narrangements across its operations. \nImplementation period  January 2014\u2013December 2016  \nConstruction arrangements  Goods and services for each subproject will be procured from ADB member \ncountries in a transparent manner through competitive bidding procedures. Each \nproject company will enter into engineering, procurement, and construction \ncontracts with subcontractors. \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  Each plant will be paid a wastewater treatment fee by the end-users through the \nmunicipal government based on the volume of wastewater treated. The wastewater \ntreatment fee is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect the cost and inflation. \nThe plant will also be paid a water purchase fee by the industries and municipal \ngovernment for reclaimed water. \nMajor cost structure  The major costs comprise electricity, chemicals, administrative expense, and \nmaintenance expense. \nOperation and maintenance  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each project company\u2019s \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2012.

It is economically viable as the economic \ninternal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Loan \n20.  ADB will provide a loan of up to $240 million equivalent to BEWG and BEGC, comprising \nan A-loan of up to $120 million equivalent in dollars and yuan, and a complementary loan of up \nto $120 million equivalent in dollars and yuan. The ADB loan to BEGC will be unconditionally \nand  irrevocably  guaranteed  by  BEWG.  ADB  will  fund  the  A-loan  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources and the complementary loan will be funded by commercial banks. The proposed A-\nloan  will  have  a  maturity  of  up  to  10  years,  including  a  3-year  grace  period  on  principal \nrepayments. The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the A-\nloan.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Technical Assistance \n1.  Impact, Key Activities, and Output \n21.  While energy is a major user of water, it also constitutes a major cost for municipal water \nservice. 15 Electricity accounts for 50% of the direct costs in wastewater treatment. To meet the \nnational  reuse  water  standards,  wastewater  treatment  processes  need  25%\u201335%  more \nelectricity. For the reuse project to succeed and for municipalities to cope with the rapid growth \nof  water  and  energy  demand,  efficient  energy  conservation  is  a  prerequisite.  Reuse  of \nwastewater  offers  a  stable  option  that  brings  substantial  benefits  to  end-users.  However, \nfreshwater\u2014ground and surface water in particular\u2014is still widely subsidized, and is thus still a \npopular option among a wide range of water users, including industry. Reuse of wastewater can \nbe more competitive if appropriate energy efficiency measures are properly introduced. The \nprimary objective of the TA is to enhance the affordability of reuse and thereby encourage \nreplacement of freshwater in cities across the country.  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  have  four  components:  (i) energy  audit  of  selected  pilot  wastewater \ntreatment and reuse plants, (ii) enhancement of the energy management system of the pilot \nplants, (iii) knowledge sharing with a wider range of municipal governments on introducing \n                                                \n15 Thermal power cooling uses about 90% of water withdrawal of ground- and surface-water source in the PRC. ", "6 \nwastewater  reuse  with  an  energy  efficiency  option,  and  (iv)  policy  recommendations.  The \nenergy-saving  solutions  will  include  feasibility  studies  for  energy  efficiency  improvements, \nintegrated energy efficiency planning and implementation, and effective energy policies for \nwastewater treatment and reuse. A capacity development program and training materials will be \nprepared for the training of senior management and key municipal government officers on \nenergy efficiency, including best practices of energy efficiency in the wastewater treatment and \nreuse operation; energy efficiency project cycle covering energy audit, list of solutions, expected \nsaving,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  and  institutionalizing  energy  efficiency \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring. Through a workshop for a wide range of municipal \ngovernments, the TA will contribute to setting a viable business model which is expected to \nencourage reuse of wastewater with an energy efficiency option as a new source of water.  \n \n23.  The TA is classified as capacity development technical assistance category B. The TA is \nestimated to cost $500,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund \n(footnote  1)  and  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility \n(footnote 2), and administered by ADB. \n \n2.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  ADB will act as the executing agency of the TA and will ensure that the TA will effectively \ncontribute to ADB\u2019s follow-on policy dialogue. The TA will be implemented over 24 months. ADB \nand BEWG will form a TA task force comprising appropriate ADB and BEWG representatives, \nas well as the TA consultants. The task force will communicate regularly to assess needs, \nmonitor progress, and discuss issues. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with simplified technical proposals. Recruitment of the firm will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n25.  Justification for ADB involvement in the project is based on the following: \n(i)  The project will have a significant demonstration impact as the first ADB private \nsector intervention to support wastewater reuse to improve the efficiency of an \nintegrated  water  chain,  which  is  still  being  developed  in  the  PRC.  ADB \nassistance  will  build  confidence  in  future  private  sector  participation  in  this \nemerging subsector.  \n(ii)  The project will build on ADB\u2019s recent complementary public sector interventions \nin the area and will reflect a continuation of ADB efforts to set high management \nand  environmental  standards.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  the  project  can \nmeaningfully contribute to the dialogue on regulations in the PRC and the region, \nand  continue to  help  establish  effective  and  efficient  solutions for  integrated \nwater management.  \n(iii)  ADB requirements will ensure that BEWG adheres to high-efficiency wastewater \ntreatments, serving as a model for the industry. The TA will address the water \nand energy nexus by enhancing energy efficiency of wastewater treatment and \nreuse. \n ", "7 \nD.  Risks \n26.  Revenue risk. Revenue risk may arise from low wastewater supply and inadequate \nwastewater treatment fees. There is concern that some municipalities do not apply the minimum \ntariff  stipulated  by  the  central  government.  BEWG\u2019s  subprojects  are  under  standardized \nconcession  arrangements  that  guarantee  minimum  offtake  and  regulated  cost\u2013plus  tariffs. \nFurther mitigating this risk are (i) strong policy pressure for tariff reform to achieve full cost \nrecovery; (ii) large latent demand for wastewater treatment and BEWG\u2019s practice of selecting \nsubprojects  in  part  based  on  demand  potential;  (iii)  BEWG\u2019s  adoption  of  higher  treatment \nstandard that commands better tariff; (iv) phased construction approach to improve the plants\u2019 \nutilization rate; and (v) the portfolio nature of ADB assistance, which diversifies the risk across a \nnumber of subprojects. \n \n27.  Offtake  counterparty  risk. Wastewater treatment fees are publicly announced and \nreliably collected from end-users through bundling with water distribution fees and backstopped \nby municipal governments under concession agreement obligations. As for wastewater reuse \nsubprojects,  the  offtaker  can  vary  depending  on  the  purpose  of  reuse.  BEWG  carefully \nevaluates offtaker credibility and subproject economics up front and will mitigate offtake risk by \nincluding a guaranteed minimum sales volume from end-users in well-defined sales agreements. \nThe  project further  benefits from  its  portfolio  arrangements to  diversify  offtake risk among \nsubprojects. \n \n28.  Regulatory risk. Due to the water scarcity and environmental pollution in the PRC, the \ncentral government has set clear targets regarding water supply, pollution control, and pricing to \nimprove wastewater treatment rate and standards.  No significant changes to industry regulation \nare expected.   \n \n29.  Completion and operation risk. In the PRC, turn-key engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction (EPC) is not commonly available and operation is typically managed in-house. \nBEWG has a proven technical and management track record in construction, operation, and \nmaintenance of wastewater treatment plants. The risk is also mitigated by the homogeneous \nnature of the subprojects and the mature nature of technology for wastewater treatment and \nreuse, as well as the low number of staff required for plant operation. \n \n30.  Associated  infrastructure  risk.  The  success  of  a  wastewater  treatment  or  reuse \nsubproject relies not only on the construction and operation of the plant, but also the readiness \nand  reliability  of  the  associated  infrastructure,  especially  the  pipelines  and  pump  stations. \nMunicipal governments usually construct and own this infrastructure. This risk is mitigated by \nBEWG\u2019s subproject screen criteria to select municipalities with comprehensive planning and \nfinancial  leeway,  and  inclusion  of  the  availability  of  the  associated  infrastructure  as  the \nmunicipality\u2019s obligation under the concession agreement. \n \n31.  Aggressive expansion plan. BEWG\u2019s plan to develop about 10 plants with a total daily \ncapacity of up to 1.8 million tons per day within 3 years requires significant management \nresources and substantial capital funding. This aggressive expansion plan involves execution \nand funding risks, which are partially mitigated by (i) BEWG\u2019s technical competence, including \nuse  of  standardized  management  systems  across  its  subprojects;  use  of  industry  experts; \nshared technical resources at several hubs for operations; and the homogeneous nature of the \nsubprojects; and (ii) adoption of eligibility criteria for the selection of subprojects and monitoring \nof compliance with financial covenants to ensure project viability. \n ", "8 \n32.  Structural subordination. The ADB loan will be structurally subordinated to direct loans \nraised by the project companies from local banks. This risk is partially mitigated by various \nmeasures employed by other ADB projects with similar project structure.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n33.  Safeguards.  The project is being processed as corporate finance, with ADB funds \nexpected to be allocated for implementing specific subprojects. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (SPS, 2009) requirements for corporate finance, the safeguard requirements \n1\u20133 will apply. In addition BEWG is to establish and maintain an environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) to screen, assess, and address environmental and social impacts \nand risks. The project is classified category B for impacts on the environment and involuntary \nresettlement, and C for indigenous peoples. The location of the wastewater treatment and reuse \nfacilities are selected in coordination with the municipal governments and are generally sited \naccording  to  the  appropriate  land  uses.  These  facilities  are  required  to  undergo  an \nenvironmental assessment process in the PRC. Involuntary resettlement impacts are expected \nto not be significant, as the plants are proposed in lands reserved for industrial uses, within or in \nthe  vicinity  of  urban  areas.  Municipal  governments  normally  complete  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation (if needed) prior to handing the area over to BEWG. Impacts on \nindigenous peoples are not anticipated as the plants are typically located in the vicinity of urban \nareas where the population is primarily Han. The potential environmental and social impacts of \nthe project have thus been identified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \nBEWG has committed to enhance its institutional capacity to adequately manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts. \n \n34.  A corporate audit was conducted on BEWG\u2019s quality, environment, health, and safety \npolicy; and its past and current performance against the objectives, principles, and requirements \nof the SPS. The audit confirms there are no existing or legacy issues relating to the two audited \nexisting plants. Gaps were identified and addressed in a corrective action plan. BEWG commits \nto adopting an ESMS, incorporating the corrective action plan, which is satisfactory to ADB \nbefore the first ADB disbursement. Key findings of the due diligence show that the company has \nan environmental management system in place. It also has screening and review procedures to \nidentify and finance subprojects. It has staff in charge of environmental and labor aspects at \ncorporate headquarters and plants, and has an internal environmental monitoring and reporting \nprocedure. BEWG and its subprojects are ISO-certified (9000, 14000, and 18000) and have \ncomplied with applicable national laws and regulations. The quality, environment, health, and \nsafety policy currently does not include policies and procedures to screen, assess, and address \ninvoluntary resettlement and impacts on indigenous peoples. Key corrective actions outlined in \nthe ESMS arrangement and agreed with the company are to (i) enhance the environmental and \nsocial policy objectives of the quality, environment, health, and safety manual to incorporate \nprovisions  to  comply  with  the  ADB  SPS  and  social  protection  requirements;  (ii)  adopt  an \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  screening  procedure  to  consider  the  significance  of \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts;  (iii)  appoint  and  train  staff  responsible  for  safeguard \ncompliance; (iv) comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements; and  \n(v) enhance safeguard monitoring and reporting procedures. The company will apply ADB's \nprohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds  abide  by ", "9 \napplicable national laws and regulations, and comply with the ADB SPS. To ensure compliance \nof future subprojects with the SPS, BEWG will carry out due diligence based on the ESMS \nscreening  mechanism.  If  category  B  or  A  impacts  are  confirmed,  BEWG  will  prepare  the \nnecessary safeguard planning documents in accordance with safeguard requirements 1\u20133 of \nthe SPS for each subproject, and submit them to ADB for review and approval. BEWG will \nsubmit monitoring reports on implementation of ESMS and the subprojects.16 \n \n35.  Other social dimensions. The company has committed to ensure that local residents \nwill comprise 90% of those engaged for jobs to be created for facility operations, and to retain \nemployees in facilities acquired through transfer of ownership. BEWG commits to maintain the \ncurrent ratio of female staff (30%) and ensure that the rights and interests of women are \nprotected.  The  company  agreed  to  prioritize  hiring  of  local  women  for  supervisory  and \nadministrative jobs created, and to engage local laborers for construction, including women. The \nproject is classified as having no gender elements. BEWG and its contractors will comply with \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy,17 report regularly to ADB on compliance with national labor \nstandards,  and  take  measures  to  adhere  to  relevant  core  labor  standards  consistent  with \nnational laws.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n36.  BEWG was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n37.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n38.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 18  the \nGovernment of the PRC will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to BEWG. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.
