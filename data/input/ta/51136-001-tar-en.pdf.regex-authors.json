INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the National Development Agency (NDA) in \npreparing  a  web-based  information  system  with  an  integrated  information  database.  The \nproposed TA will strengthen coordination and planning of development policy in Mongolia in line \nwith the objectives of the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030.1 The TA will reduce \nduplication and overlap in government policy and provide a stronger basis for prioritizing and \nallocating scarce government resources to development priorities. Increasing the efficiency with \nwhich available resources are used is particularly important given Mongolia\u2019s current economic \nchallenges, which have resulted in drastic fiscal consolidation of the government budget. The TA \nis closely aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020, and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Mongolia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The NDA was established in 2016 under the Prime Minister\u2019s office with the mandate to \ncoordinate the implementation of the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (footnote \n1). As such, the NDA is the key regulatory agency tasked with ensuring the country\u2019s economic \nstability  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  an  integrated  socioeconomic  and \ninvestment policy. The NDA is responsible for identifying and integrating national, sectoral, \nregional, and investment policies in Mongolia; this involves working with over 300 existing sectoral, \nsubsectoral and regional development policy documents and coordinating closely across all line \nministries and with the governor\u2019s office in each aimag (province). \n \n3.  However, at present there is no integrated database that serves as a repository for such \npolicies. This challenges NDA\u2019s capacity to oversee policy coherence and ultimately support \nbetter allocation of resources to government priorities. It also complicates monitoring of policy \nimplementation and the dissemination of new and existing policies across government. The \nproblem is accentuated by Mongolia\u2019s political cycle, where a change in government results in \nextensive changes at senior levels across ministries; in the absence of an integrated database, \nthe result is a loss of institutional memory, which hinders effective policymaking. \n \n4.  Creating an efficient database platform and ensuring that the government has the skills \nneeded to maintain it are important steps in supporting better policymaking. The TA will facilitate \nthe timely dissemination of relevant policies and evidence, which is burdensome and inefficient \nunder the current manual system. The TA will support efforts by NDA to improve policy coherence \nat the state, sectoral, and regional levels through a more effective and efficient system to collate, \nreview, and engage with policy development, and in this way help improve the allocation of \nresources to government priorities, and alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals. \n \n5.  This TA is particularly important given the current context in Mongolia. Falling commodity \nprices combined with a lack of fiscal discipline have significantly worsened Mongolia\u2019s fiscal \nposition and undermined debt sustainability. This resulted in the negotiation of an International \nMonetary Fund (IMF)-led program,3 backed by ADB and other development partners, which will \nenhance medium-term growth prospects. However, implementation of this program will require \n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA will help the government  develop a web-based platform with an integrated \ninformation database to support sectoral policy makers in development policy planning, and \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive capacity development plan to use and maintain the \ndatabase.  \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  development  policy  and  planning \nstrengthened. The TA will have the following outcome: monitoring and oversight of development \npolicy improved.4 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n8.  The TA will have the following outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Integrated database software platform with web-based interface created. \nAn integrated database platform will be created to link two existing government databases (the \nindustry information system and the sector information system databases) with three proposed \ndatabases (for policy documents, project management, and research and analysis). The platform \nwill include a web-based user interface to facilitate the easy input and extraction of data. The \nplatform should facilitate the extraction of data that is relevant to the mandate of the NDA. The \nplatform will be designed to (i) allow additional databases to be easily integrated into it, and/or (ii) \nbe easily integrated into other government data- or information technology (IT)-based initiatives. \n \n10.  The focus of the TA is the creation of the database platform that links databases and has \na web-based interface. The TA will not populate or build the five databases to be integrated\u2014 \nthat will be the responsibility of the NDA or the government department or agency that owns the \ndatabase(s) concerned. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of government staff to use and maintain database enhanced. \nCapacity development will include (i) day-to-day use and maintenance of the platform, such as \ndata input, platform and interface use, system maintenance, and other activities required to \nsuccessfully maintain and use the platform; and (ii) the extraction of relevant data from the system, \nand  statistical  analysis  of  the  data  to  support  policy  decisions.  A  comprehensive  capacity \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  required  staff  and  skills  will  be  prepared,  and  technical  training \nworkshops and seminars conducted, with skilled trainers recruited to develop and run the training. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide $50,000 of counterpart support in the form of office \n                                                \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \naccommodation, communication facilities for consultants, conference and training venues, a full-\ntime dedicated staff officer, data entry costs, tax exemptions on any equipment purchased, \nadministrative support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2017 to 31 December 2019. The NDA will be \nthe executing agency. ADB will engage a full-time TA coordinator and a part-time IT specialist to \nform a project implementation unit, oversee the TA and help manage the software development \nconsulting firm. ADB will engage a software development firm to undertake software development \nas well as testing, training, and any other activities deemed necessary to ensure the software is \noperational. ADB will also engage a short-term expert to support the development of a regulation \nconcerning data input and disclosure, as planned under the Development Policy and Planning \nLaw. \n \n14.  The NDA will form a TA steering group to guide the TA, composed of senior officials from \ngovernment departments and agencies that are affected by the TA. The group will be chaired by \nthe NDA chairperson. The group\u2019s proposed composition will be sent to ADB for no-objection \napproval prior its formation. The TA coordinator will act as secretary to the steering group. In \naddition, the TA coordinator will form, participate in, and lead a working group composed of the \nIT specialist, one full-time NDA staff officer, and other relevant working-level staff from the NDA \nas appropriate. The working group will be responsible for managing the TA on a day-to-day basis \nand liaising with relevant staff within the NDA and other agencies. Training on data input, platform \nand interface use, maintenance of the system, and other issues needed to enable successful \nmaintenance and use of the platform will be included in the consulting firm\u2019s contract. The firm \nwill also be responsible for developing a capacity development plan, which will include training on \nthe extraction of relevant data from the system, and statistical analysis of the data to support \npolicy decisions. There will be three workshops (inception, midterm, and closing) in addition to \nthe training. \n \n15.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation, printing and copying, meals, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative \nsupport, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB \nprocedures, the TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or related costs \nsuch as staff salaries and allowances, and use of executing agency resources (such as office \naccommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \n16.  The executing agency will provide office space, and server and other equipment required \nto  run  the  system  once  setup  is  complete.  It  will  also  provide  access  to  utilities  and \ntelecommunications (including a broadband internet connection) for the consultants. It will supply \ndata and documents as required under the TA, and cover the cost of office utilities for consultants. \nThe executing agency will designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking and writing \nskills, and will facilitate all TA activities and links to local government representatives and \nproviders to ensure effective implementation of TA activities. \n \n17.  The project implementation unit will establish a separate advance payment facility in US \ndollar at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB in coordination with the Ministry of Finance in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  1 October 2017\u201331 December 2019 \nExecuting agency  National Development Agency \nImplementing agency  National Development Agency \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nTA coordinator  26 person-months  $80,000 \nIT specialist  12 person-months  $60,000 \nSoftware development  40 person-months  $200,000 \nand training consulting \nfirm \nData input regulation  4 person-months  $20,000 \nexpert \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants: \nShopping (office  1 contract  $40,000 \nequipment and \ndatabase IT \nequipment) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IT = Information Technology, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.
