At  the  request  of  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for \nassistance to review and planning for development of its legal and judicial system, the Fact-\nFinding Mission for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited \nBeijing from 24 to 28 March 2003.  The TA was included in the 2003 country assistance plan for \nthe PRC. The Mission held discussions with the authorities involved in the legal and judicial \nsystems, i.e., the Legislative Affairs Commission (LAC), Standing Committee of the National \nPeople\u2019s  Congress,  Office  of  Legislative  Affairs  (OLA)  of  the  State Council,  and  Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court (SPC), and reached an understanding with them on aspects of the TA, including \nthe objective, scope, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements.1\nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Implementation of the remarkable economic reforms in the PRC has spanned more than \ntwo  decades.  Parallel  to  the  economic  developments  are  sweeping  reforms  of  and \ndevelopments in the legal and judicial system. The most important achievements in this area \ninclude (i) a constitutional amendment to include the rule of law as a guiding principle in \ngoverning the country; (ii) adoption of economic laws and regulations to transform the economy \nfrom  a  centrally  planned  one  to  a  market  based  one,  to  restructure  and  transform  the \nenterprises into  corporations,  and  to  promote  foreign  direct  investment;  (iii)  change  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s functions through administrative and social legislation to (a) free the Government \nfrom  directly  managing  and  operating  enterprises,  (b)  develop  social  and  nongovernment \norganizations  to  undertake  some  social  functions,  (c)  simplify  and  streamline  procedures, \nincluding administrative permits and licensing, and (d) strengthen the accountability of the \nGovernment  agencies  in  performing  their legal  duties;  (iv)  development  and  reform  of  the \njudicial system; and (v) development of an independent legal profession; legal education and \ntraining system; and uniform legal and judicial examination system for legal professionals, \nprosecutors, and judges. \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been an active supporter of the development \nand reform of the legislative, legal, and judicial system. The assistance provided by ADB has \ncovered legislative, administrative, and judicial areas and formed an important dimension of the \ncooperation between the PRC and ADB. Poverty reduction is the overarching objective of ADB. \nEconomic growth is an essential prerequisite for poverty reduction. A sound legal and judicial \nsystem is essential to make markets work efficiently. The impacts on poverty reduction will be \nincreased through active interventions of the Government and public institutions, in which legal \nand judicial systems play an important role. A legislative process that uses a participatory \napproach, administration in accordance with law, a transparent and predictable legal system, \nand an efficient and impartial judicial system enhances the legal rights and interests of the \ngeneral public as a whole, and such legal and judicial systems will maximize the effectiveness \nof pro-poor interventions. \n4.  Starting  from  2003,  all  major  national  legislative,  legal  implementation,  and  judicial \nauthorities are conducting a review and planning exercise to assess the progress made, review \nthe lessons learned, analyze the issues to be solved, and formulate plans on the directions, \nactions,  programs,  and  implementation  activities  for  future  development  and  reform  in  the \nPRC\u2019s legislative, legal, and judicial system. The timing of this review and planning exercise is \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 February 2003 under the title of \n\u201cStrategic Review and Planning for Development of the Legal and Judicial System.\u201d ", "2\n(i) critical because it is occurring as a new generation of leadership is ushered in with new policy \nagenda and emphasis; and (ii) strategically important because it will outline how the legal and \njudicial system will help (a) ensure the achievement of the objectives of economic and social \ndevelopment, and (b) develop the goals and implementation measures for the development and \nreform of the legal and judicial system for the next 5\u201310 years.\n5.  ADB\u2019s support will (i) help increase the transparency of this important policy-making \nprocess; (ii) facilitate the exchange of views on issues of strategic significance in the selected \nareas  of  the  legislation,  administration,  and  judicial  system;  and  (iii)  help  deepen  the \nunderstanding  about  the  interaction  between  rule  of  law  and  economic  growth  and  social \ndevelopment, and develop criteria to measure the effectiveness of the support in legal and \njudicial areas.  \n6.  The TA is an attempt to facilitate the use of a participatory approach in this important \npolicy formulation process and to make the process transparent. This is the first time that the \nthree highest national legislative, administrative, and judicial authorities are willing to involve \nADB  in  a  review  and  planning  exercise,  which  traditionally  has  been  an  internal  working \nprocess. In the past this exercise has had limited direct participation of stakeholders outside \nthese authorities. The results of the exercise were not made available to the public in a systemic \nway, but were provided to the public through piece-by-piece ad hoc news releases. \n7.  ADB\u2019s support may facilitate broadening the direct participation by the stakeholders in \nthis process. The stakeholders who will participate in the reviewing and planning process with \nADB\u2019s assistance will include legislative, administrative, and judicial authorities at the local \nlevels; academic and professional groups; and nongovernment organizations interested in legal \nand judicial system development and reform. The bilateral and multilateral assistance agencies \nthat have been providing support to the PRC in these areas will also be invited to attend the \nseminars or symposiums.  International and domestic experts specialized in general PRC law or \nin the specific legal areas will be involved in the process as consultants or resource persons. \nThe result of this exercise will be contained in a series of reports authored by LAC, OLA, SPC, \nand the consultants and the reports will be distributed at a seminar at the conclusion of the TA. \nIf the reports are of an adequate standard, they will be published in Chinese and English.  \n8.  Involvement  through  the  TA  in  the  review  and  planning  process  will  give  ADB  an \nopportunity to exchange views with the legislative, administrative, and judicial authorities on \nimportant issues in economic law, administrative law and reform, and judicial system reform and \nto provide advice to these authorities during the process of shaping the reform agenda.  \n9. Economic Laws. The National People\u2019s Congress has set a target of establishing in 10 \nyears a legal framework suitable for a market economy. To achieve this target, continued efforts \nare needed to prepare and adopt new legislation of strategic importance and to adjust the \nexisting laws and regulations for a market economy. The important laws to be put in place \nduring this period will include (i) amending the Company Law and Securities Law, and (ii) \nadopting a state assets management law, an enterprise registration law, a bankruptcy law, a \nsocial  security  law,  and  banking  laws.2  Creation  of  equal  opportunities  is  important  policy \n2  The ongoing ADB-funded TA for Development of Economic Laws (ADB.1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Development of Economic Laws. Manila [TA 3279-PRC, approved in 1999 for $1.4 million]) is \nsupporting the draft work for amendment to the company law, enterprise registration law, bankruptcy law, and \nsocial security law; TA for banking laws and regulations (ADB.2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Banking Laws and Regulations. Manila [TA 3890-PRC, approved in 2002 for $800,000]) is supporting \nthe legislative work of banking laws and regulations. ", "3\nobjective in the economic reform. This requires developing a uniform and consistent regulatory \nframework governing all types of enterprises and establishing and maintaining an environment \nof fair competition. The legislative work that can help achieve this objective may include (i) \nmaking the company law suitable for all types of corporate enterprises; (ii) phasing out other \nlaws  governing  the  corporate  organizations  based  on  the  ownership,  i.e.,  different  laws \ngoverning respectively, state-owned, collectively-owned, and privately-owned enterprises; (iii) \nunifying the foreign investment laws and narrowing and removing the differences in corporate \ngovernance and organizational structure between the laws for domestic enterprises and those \nfor  foreign  investment  enterprises;  and  (iv)  initiating  research  on  a  competition  policy  and \npreparation of a competition and antimonopoly law.  \n10. Administrative System Reform and Administrative Law. The major objectives of \nadministrative system reform are to achieve efficiency and administration in accordance with \nlaw. Accomplishing the first objective involves changing the administrative agencies\u2019 functions \nand  restructuring  them.  The  legal  and  judicial  system  reform  will  directly  contribute  to \nadministration in accordance with the law, focusing on the legal obligations of administrative \nagencies to perform their official duties, the legal constraints that prevent these agencies from \nmisuse of their authorities, procedures to redress such misuse, and remedies for wrongdoings \nby the administrative agencies. Administrative legislation should clearly define the authorities \nand duties of administrative agencies and the procedures for exercising the authorities and the \nlegal consequences of misusing their authorities and failing to perform official duties. Through \napplication and enforcement of the administrative laws3, (i) administrative agencies will be held \naccountable for carrying out official duties and exercising their authority, (ii) the legal rights and \ninterests of citizens and legal entities will be protected, (iii) the wrongdoings of administrative \nagencies and officials will be corrected, and (iv) compensation will be provided to the citizens \nand entities who suffered the damage due to such wrongdoings.   \n11. Judicial System. An impartial and efficient judicial system is a guarantee for fairness \nand justice throughout a society. To ensure impartiality and increase efficiency is a key objective \nof judicial system reform. Impartiality relies on (i) judges whose qualifications meet requirements \nof the Uniform Legal Qualification Examination, introduced in 2002; (ii) procedural safeguards \nso that the judges hear and decide cases solely in accordance with law; and (iii) institutional \nassurance or redesign to maintain independence of the judicial organs in performing their \nduties,  involving  reform  of  human,  financial,  and  material  resources  management  and \nseparation of judicial adjudication work from administrative affairs. The efficiency of the judicial \nsystem  will  be  improved  through  (i)  capable  and  professionally  qualified  judges  and \nadministrative personnel, (ii) separation of adjudication work from administrative affairs, (iii) \nimprovement  of  working  procedures  and  the  case  management  system,  and  (iv)  effective \nenforcement of decisions.\n12.  The  past  two  decades  in  the  PRC  have  shown  a  positive  correlation  between  the \ndevelopment of the legal and judicial system and economic growth and social development. A \nsystematic and comprehensive review of the development and reform of the PRC\u2019s legal and \njudicial system will help (i) identify the elements in the legal and judicial system that have direct \nimpact on economic growth and social development, (ii) enrich the knowledge about the factors \nin the legal and judicial system of the development and reform that are of general application, \nand (iii) create criteria to measure the impacts of the development of legal and judicial system \non economic growth and development of  a value system. Such criteria are independent of the \n3  Such laws include the Administrative Punishment Law, State Compensation Law, Administrative Reconsideration \nLaw, Administrative Litigation Law, and Administrative Licensing Law. The Administrative Licensing Law was \nprepared with the assistance of ADB through TA 3279-PRC: Development of Economic Laws (footnote 2).
