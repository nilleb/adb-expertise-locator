INTRODUCTION \n1.  The postconflict economic recovery and development process, successfully supported \nby the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, has improved law and order and \nfinancial discipline, and the Government has commenced a number of major reform initiatives. \nAs a result, public confidence and the business climate have improved substantially. However, \nthe country is facing a major challenge of providing job opportunities and basic services to a \nrapidly growing population. Rapid, sustainable economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty \nand support healing of the country\u2019s social fabric. With continued fiscal discipline supporting \nmacroeconomic  stabilization,  reforms  are  increasingly  focused  on  medium  and  long-term \nmeasures  to  improve  the  business  environment  in  order  to  support  investment  and \nentrepreneurship and to facilitate economic growth led by the private sector. Thus building \ncapable public institutions is an urgent priority. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is helping the Government of Solomon Islands to \nformulate and implement policies and strategies geared toward achieving economic growth led \nby the private sector. In 2005, a private sector assessment for Solomon Islands1 concluded, \namong other key findings, that the existing legal business framework does not adequately \nsupport  modern  business  practices  and  stressed  the  need  for  substantial  reform.  ADB \nsubsequently prepared a diagnostic report2 on the legal business environment to identify and \nassess reform priorities for the Government\u2019s consideration. On that basis, the Government \ndecided  to  initiate  a  comprehensive  process  of  business  law  reform  and  requested  ADB \nassistance.  \n \n3.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) project3 directly links to ADB\u2019s Country Strategy \nand Program Update for Solomon Islands and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u2013\n2009. The Government concurs with the TA's objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  framework  is  presented  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Economic development involves a substantial increase in the number and complexity of \nbusiness transactions, along with increasing specialization and division of labor into production \nand  service  delivery,  as  well  as  increased  international  trade  and  investment.  The  legal \nframework  governing  business  transactions  is  therefore  central  to  the  development  of  the \nprivate sector. Company law regulates the formation, operations, and closure of companies in \nthe  interests  of  shareholders,  creditors,  investors,  employees,  and  consumers.  Laws  and \npractices should be designed so as to allow investment and contracting over long time horizons \nat reasonable cost, keep the costs of transactions as low as possible, and confine the risks of \ninvestment and entrepreneurship to business decisions.  \n \n5.  Broader  challenges  facing  businesses  and  investors  in  Solomon  Islands  include \nglobalization  and  increased  competition,  structural  changes  in  the  course  of  the  ongoing \neconomic  reform  process,  and  generally  weak  institutional  support  along  with  the  issues \ninherent in doing business in the context of a small, remote state. To meet these challenges, a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Private Sector Assessment for Solomon Islands. Consultant report. Manila and Sydney. \n2  ADB. 2005. Solomon Islands: Reforming Commercial Law to Advance Private Sector Development. Manila. \nConsultant  Report  prepared  under  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  for  Improving  the  Legal  Business \nEnvironment in the Pacific Region. Manila (TA 6162-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 July 2005. \n ", "2   \nlegal system capable of accommodating different business structures that can adapt to both \ndomestic and international conditions and opportunities is required. Company law lies at the \nheart of an economy, because it provides the legal foundation for all companies and facilitates \ncommercial transactions. \n \n6.  The Solomon Islands\u2019 Companies Act, based on the UK Act of 1948, and associated \nlegislation  and  implementing  institutions,  specifically,  the  companies  registry,  are  a  logical \nstarting point for broader business law reform, because deficiencies in the act inhibit business \nformation.  As  its  historical  context  suggests,  the  Companies  Act  is  not  suited  to  modern \nbusiness  practices,  does  not  reflect  realities  in  a  small  island  context,  and  provides  an \ninadequate foundation for sustainable economic development. Virtually every aspect of doing \nbusiness\u2014start-up, operation, closure\u2014is difficult and expensive. The World Bank\u2019s 2005 doing \nbusiness survey confirms Solomon Islands\u2019 weaknesses in relation to its legal and regulatory \nbusiness environment and underscores the country\u2019s low performance compared with regional \nand international peer countries.4 Legislation prescribes enforcement processes that rely on \npoorly functioning institutions, consequently law enforcement is a major issue that increases the \ntransaction  costs  of  contracting.  In  addition,  the  regulatory  system  is  burdensome,  forcing \nbusinesses to spend substantial time and money running the gauntlet of rules, taxes, and \nlicenses  that  do  not  have  any  compensating  public  policy  objective.  The  procedures  for \nincorporating  are  time-consuming  and  costly,  especially  for  small  businesses,  because  of \ncomplicated procedures, filing requirements, slow processing of applications, and poor security \nof information and documentation. Discretionary authority in the areas of business licensing and \ncompany registration processes involves delays and may invite corruption. Public prosecution of \nmisconduct is limited. The costs and inconvenience of using the legal system are especially \nhigh for populations in rural areas, that is, the majority of Solomon Islanders. \n \n7.  The ability to organize economic activity under the legal persona of a corporation is \nimportant in Solomon Islands to improve access to finance;5 facilitate and reduce the costs of \ncontracting; permit corporate structures that take the often rural, community-based, and natural \nresource-driven  context  of  economic  activity  in  Solomon  Islands  into  account;  and  protect \nowners from being made personally liable for their companies\u2019 debts (limited liability6). The \nCompanies Act does not address these issues adequately. \n \n8.  Recognizing these deficiencies, the Government has decided to reform business law \nand related administrative barriers. It asked ADB to help reform the Companies Act, present \nreform recommendations for the companies registry, and establish links to relevant ongoing and \nplanned legal reform exercises. A separate ADB TA to support collateral reform is planned for \n2006 (footnote 5). The World Bank Group\u2019s Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) has \nsupported  the  drafting  of  the  new  Foreign  Investment  Bill,  which  reflects  a  shift  from  an \n                                                 \n4  According to the survey, starting a business in Solomon Islands takes 35 days and costs around 44% of annual \naverage per capita income, compared with an average of 21 days and around 9% of per capita income in Pacific \nislands employing good business practices. Similarly, enforcing a contract in Solomon Islands takes 455 days \ncompared with 240 days in Pacific islands employing best practices and 27 days under global best practices. The \ncost of enforcing a contract is roughly 141% of the debt value, compared with 35% and 4% under Pacific and \nglobal best practices, respectively. (World Bank. 2005. Doing Business in 2005. Washington, DC.) \n5  ADB is conducting a diagnostic study of the collateral system in Solomon Islands. (2004. Technical Assistance for \nDiagnostic Studies for Secured Transactions Reforms. Manila. (TA 6202-REG)). Preliminary findings suggest that \nnone of the important elements of a secured transactions framework are functioning effectively. Reform of the \nsecured transactions framework has therefore been programmed for ADB TA assistance in 2006.  \n6  In Solomon Islands, limited liability protection is, in practice, often illusory for all but the largest businesses, as \nlenders typically require shareholders to provide personal guarantees for company debts. \n ", "  3\napproval-based to a registration-based system and is expected to be passed shortly.7 Joint \nFIAS and ADB efforts are already under way to set up a Business Law and Administrative \nReform  Steering  Committee  (the  Steering  Committee)  as  a  mechanism  for  guiding  the \ndevelopment of an effective and efficient legal and regulatory framework governing business \nactivity. The Government is preparing to reform the taxation system with the support of the \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, which has reviewed the taxation system and \nprepared a reform strategy and implementation plan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  aims  to  contribute  to  an  improved  business  environment  that  will  lead  to \nenterprise, investment, and economic growth. To this end, the TA will help the Government \nmake significant progress in rationalizing business laws and legal institutions. Key TA outputs \nwill be reform of the Companies Act and an agreed reform roadmap for the companies registry. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will entail the following key components and related activities:  \n(i)  Reform  of  the  Companies  Act.  The  TA  will  (a)  review  existing  laws  and \nregulations  governing  business  activity  and  associated  implementing  and \nsupporting institutions; (b) formulate a white paper for reform of the Companies \nAct, including an outline of the larger business law reform agenda; and (c) draft a \nmodern company law and regulatory framework (the Company Act Reform Bill), \nwhich  reflects  the  principles  of  international  good  practice  and  responds  to \nspecific business needs in Solomon Islands. The TA will support the Government \nin adopting and implementing the Company Act Reform Bill. \n(ii)  Reform  roadmap  for  the  companies  registry.  The  TA  will  include  a \ncomprehensive review of the system of lodging, processing, and storing business \nregistration  information  and  making  it  publicly  available,  including  underlying \nlegislation.  Recommendations  and  details  for  implementing  reform  will  be \npresented,  including  implementation  components,  sequencing  of  priorities, \nfinancial feasibility of the preferred reform option, performance indicators and \ntargets, implementation risks, and the links between the recommended reform \naction and the larger business law reform agenda. \n(iii)  Medium- to long-term business law reform agenda. The TA will reinforce and \nexpand existing reform plans and studies aimed at a more extensive medium- to \nlong-term agenda for business law reform that includes follow-on measures to \ncomplement  the  TA\u2019s  outcomes.  Findings  and  recommendations  will  be \npromoted  locally  and  internationally  with  a  view  to  linking  them  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  larger  development  agenda  and  relevant  donors  assistance \nprograms. \n(iv)  Capacity  building,  consultation,  and  awareness  building.  The  TA  will \nimprove the capacity of the Government in developing and implementing the \nreform process and of government officials, the judiciary, legal practitioners, the \nbusiness  community,  and  business  development  service  providers  in \n                                                 \n7  The Foreign Investment Bill passed two readings in Parliament during the August 2005 session, but failed to \nachieve a quorum during the last (third) reading. Expectations are that Parliament will pass the bill in November \n2005. Experience suggests that broadly based stakeholder consultations and policy dialogue with key decision \nmakers, supported by a larger reform momentum, are key to the legal reform process. \n ", "4   \nimplementing and applying the proposed Company Act Reform Bill. An extensive \nconsultation process, including consultations and seminars, policy dialogue, and \nmedia campaigns, will be undertaken to help improve understanding and build \nownership of the business law reform process among key stakeholders, including \nparliamentarians, and to enhance awareness of the reform of company law and \nits implications for businesses and other stakeholders, both before and after \npassage of the Company Act Reform Bill. \n \n11.  The legal reform approach will be guided by the following principles: \n(i)  Focus. Both the law and its implementing institutions (the companies registry) \nshould make setting up and running a business as easy as possible. \n(ii)  Local detail. The Company Act Reform Bill and the recommendations for reform \nof the companies registry should take into account that most Solomon Islands\u2019 \nbusinesses  are  small  and  that  business  transactions  often  involve  rural \nenterprises. Special attention will be given to the challenges of doing business in \nrural areas. \n(iii)  Simplicity. The Company Law Reform Bill should be simple, unambiguous in \nlanguage, cost-effective, and easily understood and used by those involved in \nbusiness enterprises. Filing requirements for the companies registry should be \nkept as simple as feasible. The institutional design will take into account the \nrelatively  low  level  of  local  capacity  to  use  a  reformed  companies  act  and \nimproved companies registry. \n(iv)  Consultation. In support of the reform process, extensive consultations will be \nundertaken  with  stakeholders  in  government,  the  judiciary,  business  groups, \naccounting and business advisory services, legal practitioners, and the general \npublic. \n \n12.  TA activities will initially be guided by existing analytical work by ADB and other sources, \nincluding ADB\u2019s private sector assessment (footnote 1), legal diagnostic report (footnote 2), and \ncollateral study (footnote 5). The TA will ensure that critical linkages are drawn with and close \ncoordination ensured among relevant donor-supported initiatives in the area of business law \nand  administrative  reform.  While  this  TA  does  not  cover  implementation  of  the  reform \nrecommendations  for  the  companies  registry,  ADB  and  FIAS  will  consider  promoting,  and \npossibly  leveraging,  follow-on  TA  as  appropriate.  The  TA  will  require  a  certain  degree  of \nflexibility to take into account the interdependence and related coordination of relevant donor-\nsupported reform activities, possible delays resulting from political processes associated with \nlegal reform, and risks related to the operating environment in the current \u201cfragile state\u201d context \nof Solomon Islands. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent, of which $490,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $260,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$110,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, \n$400,000 by ADB's TA funding program and $200,000 by the Government of Australia, with the \nlatter amount administered by ADB. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $150,000, through the provision of counterpart staff salaries, office \naccommodation and transport, support services, and the facilitation of consultations. Appendix 2 \nprovides details of the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Commerce, Industries, and Employment (DCIE) will be the executing \nagency  and  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  and  implementing  TA  activities,  including \ncoordination with reform stakeholders, TA consultants, and ADB and other relevant donors. \nDCIE will provide office space for consultants and assign a senior counterpart staff member to \nlead the operational aspects of the reform process. The Department of Finance and Treasury \nand the Attorney General\u2019s Office will contribute to the reform process. In its role as facilitator of \ngovernment-wide economic reform initiatives and processes, the Economic Reform Unit of the \nDepartment of Finance and Treasury will coordinate closely with and support DCIE throughout \nthe TA. \n \n15.  The legislative and regulatory review and drafting process will be led by the Steering \nCommittee, which will be formally constituted by the time of TA inception. The permanent \nsecretary of commerce will chair the Steering Committee, whose membership will include, but \nnot  necessarily  be  limited  to,  the  attorney  general,  the  permanent  secretary  of  finance,  a \nrepresentative of the judiciary, a representative of the Bar Association, a representative of each \nof the major business organizations, representatives from the accounting and business advisory \nservices professions, and a small business representative. The committee will provide guidance \nin relation to the extent, location, and focus of public consultations on the TA\u2019s outputs. DCIE, \nsupported  by  other  relevant  Government  departments  and  offices,  will  take  primarily \nresponsibility for the public consultation process.  \n \n16.  Through  a  consulting  firm,  consulting  services  (17  person-months  international,  10 \nperson-months  domestic)  will  be  engaged  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  following \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures. The international consultant team will consist of a \ncommercial law expert with legal drafting skills (team leader), a company registration expert, a \nprivate sector development expert, and two legal peer reviewers. The international consultant \nteam will be complemented by a domestic business law expert. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. The team of consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n17.  The TA will begin in March 2006 and be implemented over a total of 24 months until \nFebruary 2008, with intermittent inputs from the international and domestic consultants. The \nCompany Law Reform Bill is expected to be finalized within 12 months of TA commencement. \nAdditional time (12 months) is allocated to allow for finalizing implementing schedules, building \ncapacity, and undertaking reform follow-up activities as required. Reporting requirements are \nspecified in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Solomon \nIslands for Supporting Business Law Reform, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n      \u2022  The Government remains \nImproved business  Reduced time (at least  Annual updates of the  committed to business \nenvironment  30%) and cost (at least  World Bank\u2019s doing  law reform. \ncontributing to  50%) to start a  business survey   \u2022  A follow-up process for \nenterprise, investment,  business within 1 year    implementing business \nand economic growth  after passing the  Government economic  registration reform is \n  Company Act Reform  statistics and central bank  introduced. \n  Bill and reforming the  reports  \u2022  Businesses accept and \n  companies registry    respond positively to the \n  ADB economic updates  new legal framework. \nStable private sector     \ncredit and investment    Risk \ngrowth rates within 2  \u2022  The country\u2019s stabilization \nyears after passing the  and development process \nCompany Act Reform  stalls. \nBill and reforming the \ncompanies registry (no \nbaseline data are \navailable because of \nthe postconflict \nsituation) \nOutcome      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Reforms continue after \nThe Government  Business and  Government gazette  general elections are held \nmakes significant  professional    in early 2006. \nprogress in  communities perceive  Internet (international law  \u2022  Reform proposals are \nrationalizing business  the reformed legal  database updates)  supported by the \nlaws and legal  framework as relevant,    Government and \ninstitutions (company  relatively clear, precise,  Business Law and  stakeholders. \nregistry)   complete, predictable,  Regulatory Reform  \u2022  The Steering Committee \nand transparent  Steering Committee  is operational and \n  reports and surveys  supportive throughout the \nAt least two high-level    reform process. \nGovernment officials  ADB private sector   \ncontinue to champion  development monitoring \nthe cause of business  and programming \nlaw and implementing  missions (private sector \ninstitutions (the  surveys)  \ncompanies registry),   \nand the donor  ADB annual economic \ncommunity continues to  updates \nsupport the process   \n  Donor programs \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  The Government and key \n1.

Consultants \n1.  Commercial Law Expert/Team Leader (international, 10 person-months) \n1.  The commercial law expert will be an attorney with a master\u2019s degree in law and at least \n15 years of relevant professional experience. The expert should have extensive experience in \npracticing law in a common law jurisdiction, in legal and regulatory review, and in preparing draft \nlaws relating to business. The expert will have managerial experience in managing legal reform \nprocesses, ideally in company and commercial law reform processes in former UK colonies \ntransitioning from the UK Companies Act of 1948. The expert will be an excellent communicator. \nExperience with Pacific islands or small states would be an asset. \n \n2.  The commercial law expert will carry out the following tasks: \n(i)  Review  existing  relevant  economic  and  legal  analysis,  especially  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) private sector assessment (PSA) and diagnostic \nreport on the legal business environment.  \n(ii)  Coordinate closely with Steering Committee members and other major reform \nstakeholders throughout the process. \n(iii)  Review and assess the Companies Act, all related legislation and regulations, \nand  implementing  and  supporting  institutions.  Assess  issues  pertinent  to \ncorporate governance and the extent to which these should be incorporated into \nthe new legislation. Review international good practice in company law reform, \nespecially with respect to small states, and legal reform processes involving \nformer  UK  colonies  transitioning  from  the  UK  Companies  Act  of  1948. \nSummarize findings and recommendations in a comprehensive, concise report \nand present it to stakeholders.  \n(iv)  Give special consideration to the needs of small businesses, especially those in \nrural areas. Identify and assess corporate structures that take into account the \ntraditional  and  often  rural  business  environment.  These  could  include,  for \ninstance, village- or community-based corporations that reflect the cooperative \nnature of Solomon Islands\u2019 social structure; associations, corporations, or simple \ntrusts that would manage natural resources and royalty payments from resource \nexploitation; and corporations that could be formed to own and manage land. \n(v)  Take into account the contextual issue of a relatively low base of capacity among \nkey stakeholders. \n(vi)  Identify and briefly assess related legal and regulatory reform areas that should \nbe candidates for a wider reform agenda to be undertaken by the Government. \nList  all  business  laws.
