INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific region is rapidly urbanizing, with 44% of the Pacific\u2019s population, excluding \nPapua New Guinea, now living in urban areas. In the region\u2019s smallest countries, such as the \nCook Islands, at least three out of every four residents are already urban dwellers. Larger \nPacific developing member countries (DMCs) that are still predominantly rural, such as Solomon \nIslands, have the highest urbanization rates.  \n \n2.  The  regional  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  support  the \nimplementation of the regional urban agenda in priority Pacific DMCs, which was agreed by \nPacific  DMCs  during  the  2015  Pacific  Urban  Forum.  The  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  were \nsubsequently confirmed during TA fact-finding missions fielded to the target Pacific DMCs. The \nTA is in line with the Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich promotes economically competitive, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable urban \ndevelopment in ADB DMCs.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Urban growth in Pacific DMCs has been largely unplanned, resulting in inadequate basic \nurban infrastructure services such as water supply, sanitation, flood control, and urban transport; \na shortage of affordable serviced land and housing; growing informal settlements; degradation \nof the surrounding environment; and increased exposure and vulnerability to natural hazard and \nclimate change risks. \n \n4.  In the most rapidly urbanizing Pacific DMCs, the bulk of urban growth is taking place in \nunserviced informal settlements, particularly in peri-urban areas, often located on customary \nland, outside of town boundaries. In tourism-dependent economies such as Palau, the lack of \nadequate urban environmental infrastructure to manage growing volumes of solid and liquid \nwastes is contributing to the degradation of the surrounding natural environment, which has the \npotential to undermine tourism growth. In small, low-lying atoll countries such as the Marshall \nIslands, urbanization is increasing the exposure of people and critical urban assets to climate \nchange risks.  \n \n5.  The limited capacity to plan, manage, and coordinate urban investments; inadequate \nrevenue streams to finance and maintain such investments; and poor accountability for the \nquality of urban service delivery all contribute to the challenge of promoting more sustainable \nurban  development  in  Pacific  DMCs.  Many  Pacific  DMCs  lack  the  strategies  needed  to \nsustainably plan and manage urban development in their cities and towns. Where strategies \nand plans for the urban sector do exist, implementation is often constrained by the lack of sound \nfeasibility  assessments  for  priority  investments,  which  can  provide  the  basis  for  securing \nfinancing for urban investments.  \n \n6.  Particularly at the municipal level, urban managers lack the key skills needed to expand \nand improve the delivery of basic urban services. For example, weak financial management \ncapacity has limited the ability of municipal governments to tap new sources of revenue, such \nas user charges to finance urban services, or property taxes to fully maximize existing revenue \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2013. Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 March 2016.  \n ", "2 \nstreams. Similarly, while outsourcing of certain urban services to the private sector can result in \nmore efficient and effective urban service delivery, municipal government capacity for contract \ndesign and management remains weak.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA impact will be inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth in Pacific cities \nand  towns.  The  TA  outcome  will  be  that  investments  to  support  more  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment are better planned. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) urban development \nstrategies approved and  adopted by the target DMC governments, and (ii) regional urban \ntwinning program implemented.  \n \n9.  Given available TA resources, participating Pacific DMCs were selected based on need. \nSolomon Islands is facing rapid urbanization but is without a strategy for managing urban \ngrowth, and the government faces critical capacity constraints. The Cook Islands has existing \nurban infrastructure investment plans, but the capacity to implement these remains limited. \nSimilarly, Samoa is in the process of completing a large-scale foreshore development plan for \nApia, but needs further support to assess identified urban infrastructure investments in more \ndetail. Subject to successful achievement of initial TA outputs and to the availability of additional \nTA resources, scaling up of TA activities may be considered during implementation to also \nprovide support to Nauru, Palau, and Vanuatu in preparing urban development strategies and \nurban land use plans. \n \n10.  The TA will support the formulation of an urban development strategy, an associated \naction plan, and a capital investment plan for the Greater Honiara Area in Solomon Islands. This \nstrategy and its associated plans, which will be prepared in a highly participatory manner, are \nintended to support stronger urban management by providing an assessment of the current \nurban situation and identifying priority actions to assist more sustainable and inclusive urban \ndevelopment. An investment pipeline will be prepared to support the strategy, and will include \ncosted, priority urban investments.  \n \n11.  The capacity of urban managers in the Cook Islands, Samoa, and Solomon Islands will \nbe strengthened through TA support for twinning arrangements with local councils from within \nthe Pacific DMCs, Australia, and New Zealand. During TA implementation, suitable mentor \ncouncils  will  be  identified  based  on  the  specific  needs  of  the  targeted  local  or  national \ngovernment agencies. Twinning agreements will then be signed between mentor and recipient \ncouncils  once  scoping  visits  to  each  target  DMC  are  successfully  completed.  Capacity \ndevelopment  activities  will  focus  on  strengthening  financial  management  and  budgeting, \nimproving  municipal  service  delivery  (particularly  solid  waste  management),  and  improving \nurban infrastructure planning, prioritization, and coordination. Each twinning partnership will be \nimplemented over 6 months. The progress of each twinning arrangement will be regularly \nreviewed during TA implementation to ensure that any issues that may undermine progress are \nresolved in a timely manner. Once the twinning partnerships are concluded, the TA will take \nstock of lessons and good practices to guide the design and implementation of future twinning \npartnerships.  \n ", "3 \n12.  Parallel  support  will  be  provided  to  Samoa  and  Solomon  Islands  by  the  Cities \nDevelopment  Initiative  of  Asia  (CDIA)  to  prepare  prefeasibility  studies  for  priority  urban \ninfrastructure investments.3 Priority investments will be selected on the basis that these have \nbeen included in national urban investment plans, and have significant potential to contribute to \nsustainable urban development in targeted urban centers. Such investments should also be of a \nsize and nature that makes them suitable for consideration for future ADB financing. In Samoa, \nit is proposed that prefeasibility support is linked to priority urban transport investments included \nin the Apia Waterfront Development Plan, which is due to be completed by the end of 2016. \nCDIA support will be provided to Samoa in 2017, and the prefeasibility study will be undertaken \nover a period of 6 months. In Solomon Islands, the completion of the Greater Honiara Area \nUrban Development Strategy and its associated capital investment plan in 2018 will be followed \nby a prefeasibility study carried out over 6 months. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $770,000 of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). CDIA will provide $600,000 in \nfinancing under the Supporting the Cities Development Initiative for Asia TA (footnote 3) to \nsupport urban infrastructure investment prefeasibility studies.  \n \n14.  The governments of the target DMCs will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, meeting facilitation, access to country data, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n15.  Under the proposed twinning partnership, the TA will finance travel and support costs \nassociated with in-country visits by the mentor and recipient agencies. Mentor councils will \nprovide the staff time of experts free of charge.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB is the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented from September \n2016 to August 2019 by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department. Since the TA is intended to be demand-\ndriven,  government  counterpart  agencies  in  the  target  DMCs  are  expected  to  lead  the \nimplementation of TA activities. In Solomon Islands, the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Survey \nwill establish a high-level project steering committee to guide TA activities, as well as technical \nstakeholder working groups to oversee the development of the Greater Honiara Area Urban \nDevelopment Strategy.  \n \n17.  CDIA will manage the recruitment of consultants in close coordination with ADB\u2019s Pacific \nDepartment to carry out the prefeasibility studies for priority infrastructure investments in Samoa \nand  Solomon  Islands.  Progress  and  outputs  of  the  prefeasibility  study  will  then  be  jointly \nmonitored and reviewed by CDIA and ADB\u2019s Pacific Department. \n \n18.  The TA will require 20 person-months of international and 6 person-months of national \nconsulting services: team leader and urban development specialist (international, 4 person-\nmonths, intermittent); urban infrastructure and basic services specialist (international, 3 person-\nmonths,  intermittent);  urban  planner  (international,  3  person-months,  intermittent);  local \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2013.

Their \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. The local government capacity development specialist will \nbe recruited by ADB using the individual consultant selection method. All other consultants will \nbe recruited through a firm through quality- and cost-based selection using the 90:10 quality\u2013\ncost ratio, and a simplified technical proposal will be required. All consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).4  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Strategies and \ntechnical reports produced under the TA will be disseminated through stakeholder meetings and \nsector working groups. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Urban Infrastructure Investment Planning in the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n4 Output-based and lump-sum contracts will be considered in the engagement of consulting services to reduce \nadministrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nInclusive and environmentally sustainable growth in Pacific cities and towns (ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific \nApproach, 2015;a ADB Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020;b Strategy 2020;c and Midterm Review of  \nStrategy 2020d). \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2020     \n \nInvestments to  Project preparatory TA  Approved COBP  Pacific DMCs do not \nsupport more  assistance for at least 1  request follow-on ADB \nsustainable urban  priority urban development  support for project \ndevelopment are  project among target  design and financing of \nbetter planned  DMCs is included in a  priority urban \nCOBP nonlending pipeline  investments. \n(2016 baseline: 0). \n \n   \nOutputs  By 2019     \n \n1.
