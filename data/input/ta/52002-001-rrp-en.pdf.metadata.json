THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Chhattisgarh Road Connectivity Project. \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate and upgrade at least 850 kilometers (km) of state highways \nand major district roads (MDR) in Chhattisgarh to improve connectivity and access to basic \nservices  and  livelihood  opportunities.  The  physical  works  will  involve  upgrading  the  state \nhighways and MDRs to two-lane or four-lane width with hard shoulder along built-up areas. For \ninvestment in the physical infrastructure to be efficient and sustainable, the project will provide \nsupport to the executing agency in road maintenance and safety. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Socioeconomic  context.  Chhattisgarh  is  a  state  in  east\u2013central  India  that  was \nconstituted in 2000. The state covers an area of 137,898 square kilometers (km2), of which about \n96% is rural. It has a population of about 25.5 million, 77% of whom live in rural areas, indicating \na population density of about 150 people per km2. The literacy rate is about 71%, which is slightly \nbelow the country\u2019s average of 74%.1 Chhattisgarh is rich in natural resources and a major \nproducer of minerals, notably coal and iron ore, which significantly contribute to the production of \nsteel and electricity in the country. The state has a large forest area (44% of the territory) and \nagriculture base, which support the tribal economy and many small-scale industries. The state\u2019s \ngross domestic product (at constant prices) has increased from \u20b91.58 trillion in fiscal year (FY) \n2012 to \u20b92.24 trillion in FY2017, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.98%.2 \n \n4.  Despite the good economic growth experienced in 2012\u20132017, poverty remains a key \nissue. The 2011 census suggested that about 38% of the state\u2019s population lives below the \npoverty line, which is among the highest in India. The state government has recognized the \nunbalanced distribution of socioeconomic benefits and poor access to livelihood opportunities in \nthe state. Improving transport connectivity is an important factor in addressing these issues. \n \n5.  Sector context. The movement of people and goods in Chhattisgarh relies heavily on \nroads, particularly in rural areas. The total length of the road network in the state is 74,434 km. \nThis includes national highways (3,169 km), state highways (4,438 km), and district roads (25,569 \nkm), which account for most long-distance and goods vehicle trips.3 The Chhattisgarh Public \nWorks  Department  (CGPWD)  manages  these  roads.  Habitations  in  the  rural  areas  of \nChhattisgarh are connected to these major road networks through all-weather rural roads and \nvillage roads, totaling about 35,000 km. The Panchayat and Rural Development Department \nmanages these rural roads.4 Other agencies or government bodies manage the rest of the \nnetwork, which are urban and project-specific roads. \n \n                                                \n1 Government of India, National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog). State Statistics: Literacy Rate \n11 \n(accessed 2 February 2019).  \n2  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. State domestic product and other \naggregates, 2011\u20132012 series (accessed 2 February 2019).  \n3  Government of Chhattisgarh, Public Works Department. 2017. Administrative Report. Raipur.  \n4  As of 31 December 2017, about 9,200 rural habitations in Chhattisgarh had been connected to the core road network \n11\nunder the prime minister\u2019s rural road program. \n \n ", "2 \n6.  The state of Chhattisgarh lacks an adequate road network to efficiently support mobility \nacross  areas  with  natural  resources,  social  services,  industrial  centers,  and  economic \ndevelopment zones. As of FY2016, road density in Chhattisgarh was only 72.1 km per 100 km2, \nwhich is below the national average of 139.1 km per 100 km2.5 About 70% of the state highways \nhave only single or intermediate lanes, whereas most of the major and other district roads are \nsingle lanes. In contrast, the number of registered vehicles has doubled, from 2.1 million in 2009 \nto 4.8 million in 2016, with an average growth rate of 12%.6 Most of these roads need widening \nand strengthening to cater to increasing traffic demand, especially by larger goods vehicles.  \n \n7.  Contribution to Sustainable Development Goals 2030. In the absence of a safe and \nefficient road network, the objective of socioeconomic development such as reducing poverty and \nisolation of disadvantaged groups in Chhattisgarh will not be achieved. To guide the development \nof the road transport subsector, the state government, through the CGPWD, has established a \nstrategy that will contribute to the country\u2019s objective of achieving the Sustainable Development \nGoals.7 The strategy includes three key initiatives in the road transport subsector: (i) connecting \nthe state capital to all district headquarters through four-lane roads, (ii) connecting the district \nheadquarters to all block headquarters through two-lane roads, and (iii) connecting all block \nheadquarters to village councils through all-weather roads. The improved road network will \nfacilitate better access to economic centers and livelihood opportunities, education, and health \nfacilities, and contribute to private sector development. To achieve these targets, the CGPWD \nneeds to upgrade about 2,806 km of national highways, 2,675 km of state highways, and 16,134 \nkm of other state roads. In line with this development plan, by 2020, the CGPWD plans to upgrade \n1,393  km  of  national  highways  under  the  National  Highway  Development  Project  with  an \nestimated cost of $1.6 billion.8 The CGPWD also plans to upgrade 4,100 km of state highways, \nmajor district roads, and other roads with a budget provision of $1.7 billion from loans, mineral \ndevelopment plans, and regular state funding. \n \n8.  Road maintenance. The CGPWD is responsible for planning, performing, and monitoring \noverall road maintenance activities. Road maintenance is funded through regular state budget \nallocations. The CGPWD still follows conventional practice in road maintenance, which is based \non regular inspection by the CGPWD staff. The staffing capacity of the CGPWD will eventually \nconstrain this practice as the number of roads to be maintained increases. With the increasing \nresponsibility to maintain more roads, as well as to sustain the service performance and safety \nlevels of the existing roads at an acceptable level, there is an urgent need to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of the road maintenance practices of the CGPWD. This includes adopting a \nperformance-based maintenance approach, through which payment for maintenance is released \nto the contractor based on achievement of an agreed level of services. \n \n9.  Road safety. Road safety issues have contributed to poor mobility in Chhattisgarh. In \n2017, 13,563 accidents occurred in the state, of which 3,379 occurred on state highways.9 Even \nthough the overall number of accidents has declined to 13,580 in 2016, the severity index has \nincreased from  28.8  to  30.5  in the  same  period.10  Land  use  changes  such  as  unplanned \ndevelopments along the roads, which lead to increased roadside activities and illegal crossings, \n                                                \n5  Government of Bihar, Finance Department. 2018.

Motorcycles and goods vehicles are the two highest \ncontributors to road accidents. Even though the CGPWD has adopted an acceptable standard for \nroad design, preventive measures to reduce the number of accidents need to be strengthened \nthrough adequate investment in road safety measures, ensured through an auditing mechanism, \nand sustained with adequate maintenance. Additionally, an increase in road safety awareness \namong the communities affected by the roads is necessary, especially for the elderly, women, \nchildren, and persons with disabilities. \n \n10.  Lessons from previous ADB assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting the state of Chhattisgarh\u2019s road transport subsector through two loans, both using the \nsector lending modality. The first loan, closed in 2012, was for $180 million and covered the \nimprovement of about 1,700 km of state highways.11 The inadequate experience of the CGPWD \nin planning and formulating projects of similar size and complexity, and external factors such as \ndelay in obtaining environmental clearances and security threats in certain areas, slowed the \nimplementation of the first loan. Despite the delay, the project has substantially improved access \nto social services such as primary health care centers, schools, colleges, and markets, and \nprovided good support for rapid socioeconomic development in the project area. Even though the \nfirst loan was rated less than successful on account of efficiency, the project impact was rated \nsignificant.12 The technical assistance (TA) attached to the first loan assisted the CGPWD in \ninstitutional reform and strengthened its capacity in terms of road operation monitoring, financial \nmanagement,  and  human  resources  planning.  The  TA  has  significantly  improved  the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the state road transport subsector management system. ADB \napproved the second loan for $300 million in December 2012 to cover an additional 916 km of \nstate highways. ADB prepared the loan through regular consultations with the CGPWD, which \nhad gained experience from the implementation of the first loan.13 Despite slight delays because \nof design and safeguards issues, the second loan is on track to meet the intended project outputs. \nThe TA attached to the second loan further enhanced the CGPWD\u2019s capacity for project planning, \nprocurement, and project and contract management, and developed a database on road assets. \nThe previous two projects offer lessons on implementing road development projects in the state. \nTo minimize the likelihood of the same issues recurring, the project team identified the following \nmeasures: (i) propose the project as a stand-alone project loan, whereby ADB confirmed due \ndiligence for all project roads at the project preparatory stage; (ii) mobilize consultants to carry \nout an independent review of the engineering design, and measures to address design issues \nhave been incorporated; and (iii) a project management consultant (PMC) will provide technical \nsupport to the CGPWD, including safeguards. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  mobility  and  accessibility  in  India \nimproved.14  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  road  connectivity  and  safety  in \nChhattisgarh improved.15 \n \n \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2003.

Output  1:  State  highways  and  major  district  roads  improved.  The  project  will \nrehabilitate or upgrade two state highways and 23 MDRs with a total length of at least 850 km in \nChhattisgarh. The selected roads will be rehabilitated or upgraded from single- or intermediate-\nlane width to two- or four-lane width with hard shoulder in built-up areas. The project roads will \ninclude bus stops in villages and built-up areas, which are accessible to the elderly, women, \nchildren, and persons with disabilities, and street lighting for security and road safety, especially \nat accident black spots. The project will introduce, for the first time, the provision of 5-year \nperformance-based maintenance in each civil works contract to facilitate the sustainability of the \nphysical investment. As per the current arrangement, the state government budget will finance \nroad maintenance under the 5-year maintenance contract. \n \n13.   Output 2: Institutional capacity for road safety and maintenance of state highways \nand major district roads strengthened. The project will assist the CGPWD to manage the road \nmaintenance activities through the development of a road maintenance program and application \nof the manual for road maintenance, which was developed under ADB-financed TA projects.16 \nThe road maintenance program will identify roads to be maintained to an acceptable service level \nin each year based on expected road utilization, physical condition and historical maintenance \ndata. The project will also introduce road safety audit, to be performed at design, construction, \nand operation stages, and provide institutional support to mainstream road safety in the CGPWD\u2019s \noperations. Road safety awareness sessions will also be carried out for students and members \nof communities along the proposed roads. Additionally, the project will promote the strengthening \nof the CGPWD\u2019s financial management system. \n \n14.  Finance plus and value added by ADB assistance. The project will continue ADB\u2019s \nassistance in the road transport subsector in Chhattisgarh.17 The project team integrated ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities in the project design: (i) reducing poverty and inequality, (ii) \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  (iii)  tackling  climate  change,  (iv)  promoting  rural \ndevelopment, and (v) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.18 The project is also \nconsistent with the strategic objectives set out in the country partnership strategy on the provision \nof inclusive infrastructure networks and services (pillar 2).19 Under ADB assistance, the CGPWD \nwill introduce innovative features such as (i) 5-year performance-based maintenance in civil works \ncontracts to improve the current practice in road maintenance and to strengthen its effort to retain \nthe designed service level of the road network; (ii) road safety audit at the design, construction, \nand operational stages to help address increasing road safety risks from increased traffic volumes \nand higher average vehicle speeds; (iii) use of solar energy for street lighting; and (iv) installation \nof run-off water harvesting facilities in villages passed by the project roads. \n \n15.  Climate change adaptation. Climate risks in the form of floods resulting from extreme \nrainfall events and increased maximum temperatures exist in Chhattisgarh. Direct spillage from \nlarge rivers or floods caused by high intensity and short duration rainfall events will also cause, \namong others, overtopping and the washing away of roads, damage to culverts, and slope \nfailures. Increase in maximum temperatures may also cause damage to the pavement and bridge \njoints. Climate change adaptation measures that have been incorporated in the project include \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2012.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The CGPWD has prepared and approved the engineering design of the proposed project \nroads during the project preparatory stage. The CGPWD selected the roads based on (i) linkage \nto national highways, other state highways, MDRs, and key economic centers as described in \npara. 7; (ii) level of utilization, reflected by the annual average daily traffic; and (iii) minimized \nenvironmental and social impacts. The engineering design follows applicable criteria in line with \nIndian  Roads  Congress  regulations  and  is  optimized  for  cost  efficiency  while  meeting  the \nincreasing travel demand. The design has also considered climate change adaptation and road \nsafety aspects. The project team has conducted an independent review of the engineering design, \nand recommended improvements that have been addressed in the final design. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic viability. The project team conducted the economic evaluation of the project \nin accordance with ADB guidelines by comparing life cycle economic costs and benefits in with- \nand without-project scenarios, using a 9.0% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return \n ", "7 \n(EIRR) as decision criteria. The highway development model 4 (HDM-4) was used to estimate \nroad agency and road user costs based on input data on traffic, road geometry, pavement \ncondition, and improvement and maintenance costs. Project benefits include savings associated \nwith  vehicle  operating  costs,  travel  time,  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  and  road  accidents \n(unquantified). The EIRR of the project is estimated at 18.1%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated \nthe robustness of the economic viability of the project under adverse changes in costs and \nbenefits, with an EIRR of 13.1% under the most sensitive scenario involving a 20% increase in \ncapital costs and 20% decrease in benefits. \n \n24.  Financial sustainability. The project will not generate revenue. The CGPWD will conduct \nroad maintenance with regular budget allocations in each financial year. The annual budget for \nmaintenance expenditures increased from \u20b95.68 billion in FY2013 to \u20b95.99 billion in FY2018. The \naverage  annual  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  project  are  estimated  at  8.6%  of  the \nmaintenance budget. Even though the maintenance budget seems to increase by 1.1% in nominal \nterms, it shows reductions in real terms. This suggests a substantial risk in project sustainability \nas the number of roads maintained by the CGPWD increases. To help mitigate the sustainability \nrisk, the PMC will also support the CGPWD in preparing a road maintenance program based on \nthe database of road assets developed under the previous loan, which will facilitate more accurate \nestimation of the annual maintenance budget. Additionally, all civil works contracts will include 5 \nyears of performance-based maintenance after construction, which will facilitate maintenance in \nthe initial operating phase. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Institutional. The CGPWD will implement the project through a project implementation \nunit (PIU) dedicated for ADB projects, situated in the state capital Raipur. Because of the large \nproject coverage, four field offices have been established to support the PIU operation. The PIU \nand the field offices have gained adequate experience in road projects from the previous ADB \nprojects and strengthened staff capacity to prepare and implement the project. The PMC will \nsupport the PIU in the areas of road safety, road maintenance, and safeguard monitoring. \n \n26.  Financial management. The financial management risk is moderate, mainly because of \nthe absence of a formal internal auditing function within the PIU. Although the disbursement \nmechanism adopted by the PIU has included a systematic controlling and checking mechanism \nperformed  by  finance  and  account  staff  with  adequate  experience  in  project  financial \nmanagement, the absence of an internal auditing mechanism suggests a substantial risk. To \nmitigate this risk, the PMC will perform the internal audit for the project, prepare a financial \nmanagement manual and conduct training for the CGPWD staff on financial management. Other \nkey actions to mitigate the financial management risks are submission of a quarterly progress \nreport  with  physical  and  financial  progress  with  variance  analysis  and  the  corresponding \ndisbursement figures, and timely resolution of audit observations. The PIU submitted audited \nproject financial statements for the ongoing Chhattisgarh State Road Sector Project for FY2017 \non time with unqualified audit opinion.22  \n \n27.  Procurement of civil works. The procurement risk level is medium. The procurement of \ncivil works and consulting services financed by the ADB loan is being done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The procurement of civil works follows \nopen competitive bidding with national advertisement using an e-procurement system approved \nby ADB. The PIU has gained experience in the procurement of civil works and consultant \n                                                \n22 ADB. India: Chhattisgarh State Road Sector Project. \n ", "8 \nrecruitment from the previous ADB projects. Under advance contracting, the procurement of 25 \ncivil works packages and recruitment of four consulting service packages are ongoing. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the CGPWD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Poverty. Despite abundant natural resources, about 38% of the state\u2019s total population \nwas estimated to live below the poverty line in 2011, with a literacy rate of about 71%, indicating \na significant imbalance in access to economic and livelihood opportunities. Improved roads will \nhelp the poor to integrate into the structure of the local economy and to benefit from nonfarm \nemployment, diversified agricultural production, and trading activities. The improved roads will \nenable better access to basic services such as health care and education, and also improve the \nquality of life of the poor in affected communities. \n \n30.  Gender. The project is categorized some gender elements. The CGPWD conducted focus \ngroup discussions with women from different socioeconomic groups in the project-influence area. \nThe assessment highlights several key project benefits that the all-weather roads will bring to the \ncommunities. These include increased childbirth safety, reduced maternal and prenatal deaths \nand  mortality  of  children,  and  increased  enrollment  of  girls  in  schools  and  universities. \nAdditionally, the project will (i) raise awareness among community members and contractors\u2019 \npersonnel on sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS, health and hygiene, and human \ntrafficking; (ii) consider specific needs of vulnerable users, including the elderly, women, children, \nand disabled persons in the design and modification of roads; (iii) ensure women\u2019s participation \nin road safety awareness campaigns; and (iv) target women in livelihood training programs. \n \n31.  HIV and AIDS. India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organization estimates the number of \npersons living with HIV in India at 2.21 million in 2017, and adult HIV prevalence at 0.3%. \nAccording to the National AIDS Control Organization, HIV infection is typically concentrated \namong the poor and marginalized groups (including high-risk groups such as sex workers, drug \nusers, migrant laborers, and truck drivers). However, Chhattisgarh is a low-prevalence state and \nit is among the states where the rate of new cases declined in 2017. Based on the poverty and \nsocial  assessment,  there  is  a  low  risk  that  the  project  will  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence. \nContractors will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness for their laborers at work sites and this will be \nmonitored by the construction supervision consultants (CSC) during project implementation. \n \n32.  Labor. Provisions in the bidding documents for the civil works contractors, among others, \n(i) ensure that all applicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against \nemploying children in construction; (ii) encourage the employment of the poor and affected \ncommunities; and (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n34.  Environment  (category  B).  No  significant,  irreversible  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated and none of the roads are located inside or near protected or environmentally sensitive \nareas.  The  CGPWD  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  each  road  in \n                                                \n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories.  \n ", "9 \naccordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed these on the ADB \nwebsite. Anticipated environmental impacts from the project entail typical road construction-\nrelated issues such as acquisition of forest land; removal of trees; generation of dust, noise, \nexhaust, and waste from construction and worker camps; water contamination; occupational \nhealth and safety issues; slope failures; erosion; and siltation. Increased noise and air pollution \nas a result of increased traffic volumes can be expected during the operation stage but will be \nminimal, and based on projections, are not expected to go beyond the National Ambient Air \nQuality and International Finance Corporation standards. Mitigation measures to address all these \nhave been included in the environmental management plan (EMP), which is part of the bid \ndocuments and will be required to be implemented by the contractor. The CGPWD conducted \nmeaningful consultations with the affected persons and other key stakeholders such as the \nforestry officials while preparing the IEE. Concerns of affected persons and stakeholders will \ncontinue  to  be  addressed  during  project  implementation  through  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism proposed in the IEE. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category  A). The project was developed with a view of \navoiding or minimizing land acquisition and restriction of access by adopting the most feasible \ntechnical design. Roads will be widened from single or intermediate lane to two- or four-lane width \nwithin the existing right-of-way, except where minor realignment is required to reduce delay or to \nimprove safety. The CGPWD will acquire about 55.5 hectares of private land for the project by \ndirect purchase based on the provisions of the national law, state policy, and the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. Should negotiations fail, land and assets will be acquired using eminent domain \nin accordance with the same law and policies. The CGPWD has prepared 25 resettlement plans \nfor all project roads based on full census surveys using detailed design specifications. According \nto the surveys, 10,613 households (48,598 persons) will experience impacts on land, structures, \nand/or livelihood; 402 nontitled households (1,859 persons), who are mostly kiosk owners, will be \nfully affected; and 1,292 titled households (5,725 persons) will lose greater than 10% of their land \nby the roadside. Compensation rates at replacement cost for the loss of land and structures, \nshifting assistance, income restoration assistance, and support for vulnerable groups are provided \nin the resettlement plans. The CGPWD conducted meaningful consultations with displaced \npersons and disclosed information through the ADB website. Grievance redress mechanisms will \nbe established at each field office to respond to affected persons\u2019 concerns. The CGPWD has \nworked with ADB in the previous projects and is experienced in planning and implementing \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguards.  An  external  monitor,  third  party  validators,  and  an \nimplementation nongovernment organization will be engaged to support the CGPWD. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Scheduled tribes account for 30.6% of the total \npopulation of Chhattisgarh. Except for the forest-dwelling tribes, scheduled tribes and local \nnontribal populations live in the same communities and interact freely with each other. The social \nimpact assessments undertaken to prepare project roads suggest that road connectivity will not \nimpact scheduled tribes differently or increase their vulnerability as indigenous peoples. However, \nthe assessments indicate that in eight project roads, the 1,013 scheduled tribe households \npotentially to be affected by limited involuntary resettlement impacts are in areas designated by \nthe Constitution of India as scheduled tribe areas. Therefore, for such roads, the CGPWD has \nprepared combined resettlement and indigenous peoples plans. Meaningful consultations were \nconducted with affected scheduled tribe households to (i) seek their views on the project and its \nbenefits; (ii) determine involuntary resettlement impacts; and (iii) develop appropriate measures \nto mitigate losses, including additional allowances provided under the law. \n \n37.  The deputy general manager of the PIU will be the nodal officer for environmental and \nsocial safeguards: he will be responsible for the overall management of safeguards under the \n ", "10 \nproject, supported by an environment officer and a resettlement officer. An assistant project \nmanager who will also serve as the safeguards focal point at the site level will support each project \nmanager, who leads a field office. The PMC will provide project implementation support including \nsafeguards implementation to the PIU. Three CSCs will supervise and manage the construction \nworks, including safeguards implementation. The civil works contractors will be responsible for \nimplementing the environmental management plan and will include environment, health, and \nsafety officers in their team. The CGPWD will organize an initial coordination or training workshop \nto clarify the roles and responsibilities of each party for complying with environmental safeguard \nrequirements. Hands-on training will be conducted by the CSC or ADB as necessary during \nproject implementation. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient funding for  The CGPWD has committed the funding for road maintenance in the annual state \nroad maintenance  budget.
