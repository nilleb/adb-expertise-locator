INTRODUCTION\n1. Since 1992, the Bank has been actively promoting economic cooperation in the Greater\nMekong Subregion (GMS), which consists of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao\nPDR), Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC).  The  Third  Ministerial  Conference  under  the  GMS  initiative  held  in  Hanoi  in  April  1994\nidentified HIV/AIDS as one of the seven priority issues of concern. Later, in the first two meetings of\nthe subregional Working Group on Human Resources Development, the participants recommended\ntechnical assistance (TA) to help address the issue. Accordingly, this regional TA seeks to assist the\nsix GMS governments in their efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS. The TA will build on the work\ndone under TA 5751-REG: Cooperation in the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS in the Greater\nMekong Subregion.1 TA 5751 identified 18 regional HIV/AIDS projects including those with focus on\nworkers employed in infrastructure projects, fisher folk, and truck drivers. This TA will partially or fully\naddress four of the identified projects.2 A logical framework for the TA is presented in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The GMS is home to more than 2 million HIV/AIDS-infected people, the majority of whom are\nin the 15-35 age group. The share of HIV/AIDS-related illnesses in the total burden of disease is\nexpected to triple in the next 20 years in the subregion. The present epidemiological picture of\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in the subregion is quite diverse. There is near-epidemic prevalence in some\ncountries, including Thailand (850,000 cases), Myanmar (320,000-480,000 cases), and Cambodia\n(about 180,000 cases). Trends in recent infections suggest increasing vulnerability of countries with\nlarge populations and relatively newer epidemics, including PRC and Viet Nam. Reported new cases\nof HIV/AIDS in 1997 increased by 52 percent in the Lao PDR, 26 percent in the PRC, and 60\npercent in Viet Nam over those reported in 1996. The number of new cases in recent years is\nestimated at 30,000 in Yunnan Province and 180,000 in Viet Nam. Migration across the GMS is\naccelerating the epidemic and increasing the number of epicenters. For example, in Viet Nam the\nHIV/AIDS prevalence is the highest in Ho Chi Minh City and Quang Ninh Province, which also have\nthe highest proportion of mobile populations. Similarly, all major port towns in the GMS have high\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS.\n3. Multiple and complex factors contribute to the spread of the disease in the subregion. These\ninclude  cultural  and  socioeconomic  factors  related  to  use  and  availability  of  commercial  sex,\nsubstance abuse in some parts of the subregion, and high prevalence of other sexually transmitted\ndiseases. Migration of young and single workers, both male and female, across national boundaries\nand from rural to urban areas acts as a critical link in transmission across the subregion.3 Major high-\nrisk groups for HIV/AIDS infection are migrant workers, fisher folk, workers employed on cross-\ncountry infrastructure projects, truck drivers operating on regional routes, and sex workers. The\ndisruption of family and community life resulting from migration, especially in situations of poverty\nand crisis, increases risky sexual behavior and exposure to HIV/AIDS. Many migrant workers are\nsingle and away from their families for a long time, and are likely to use commercial sex. Others work\nin commercial sex establishments. Women migrants working in unfamiliar situations are vulnerable\nto exploitation and usually powerless to negotiate condom use. Since they often speak different\nlanguages, and have different cultures and limited social networks compared to the host population,\ntheir access to health services, information, and HIV/AIDS prevention programs is limited. Migrants\nare less likely to know about and use of contraceptives\u2014including condoms\u2014than nonmigrants.4\n                                               \n1 For $150,000, approved on 17 September 1997.\n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in February 1999.\n3  Decosas, J., F. Kane, J.K. Anarfi, K.D. Sodji, and H.U. Wagner. 1995. Migration and AIDS.  Lancet 346 (8978): 826-828.\n4  Gardner, R. and Blackburn, R. 1996. People Who Move: New Reproductive Health Focus. Population Reports, Series J,\nNo. 45. Baltimore.", "2\n4. All the GMS countries have national HIV/AIDS control programs, partly supported by various\ninternational agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). However, with the exception of\nThailand, these efforts are small and fragmented. Collectively, they are not adequate to contain the\nregional spread of the epidemic. In particular, the national programs do not specifically address the\nproblems of the migrant population. Moreover, reduced national budgets in the wake of the ongoing\neconomic crisis is further constraining the abilities of the GMS governments to address the HIV/AIDS\nepidemic.\n5. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region is a serious health problem and has important economic\nand social implications. Since young people and children are more likely to be infected by HIV/AIDS,\nthe  loss  of  human  capital  and  earning  potential  will  be  immense.  A  recent  study  shows  that\nwidespread poverty and unequal distribution of income stimulate the spread of HIV. At the same\ntime,  HIV/AIDS  infection  in  households  exacerbates  poverty  and  social  inequality,  creating\nconditions for a larger epidemic in the subregion. Therefore, breaking this vicious circle is essential\nfor improving the quality of life, supporting human development, reducing poverty, and accelerating\ngrowth.\n6. Due to the regional nature of the epidemic, national approaches to HIV/AIDS will not be\nadequate. Migration, especially across national boundaries, contributes to vulnerability and risks.\nPrevention efforts are required at points of origin, along the migration routes, and at points of\ndestination. Since these focal points are spread over the subregion, national approaches cannot\ncomprehensively tackle the issue. Moreover, a regional approach offers potential economies of scale\nand opportunities for comparative analysis and learning that would not necessarily be available\nthrough a series of discrete national approaches. Since the countries in the GMS vary considerably\nin their efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, a regional approach affords an opportunity for GMS\ngovernments and other stakeholders to share these approaches and to learn from each others\u2019\nexperiences. This will also facilitate development of regional networks and surveillance systems,\nenabling them to continue learning into the future.\n7. The subregion is experiencing unprecedented levels of population mobility in response to\nchanging economic inequalities and opportunities. Several infrastructure projects, including some\nfinanced by the Bank, are being implemented in the subregion, and attract a large number of migrant\nworkers.  Moreover,  after  the  completion  of  these  projects,  mobility  will  increase  further.  For\nprevention  of  HIV/AIDS  in  the  GMS,  it  is  important  to  focus  on  these  construction  sites  and\nhighways. Most of the HIV/AIDS prevention efforts have been aimed at women and youth and have\nnot  adequately  targeted  adult  men.  Few  satisfactory  models  are  available  to  ensure  male\nparticipation  in  the  HIV/AIDS  prevention  activities.  Development  of  guidelines  and  tool  kits  for\nintegrating HIV/AIDS activities in construction sites, and for instructing mobile men will be essential\nfor  checking  the  spread  of  the  epidemic.  These  tool  kits  will  also  be  useful  for  the  Bank\u2019s\ninfrastructure operations.\n8. Several  international  agencies,  including  the  Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  AIDS\n(UNAIDS), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Drug Control Programme, and\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), are implementing some regional activities for\nprevention of HIV/AIDS. Most of these activities relate to capacity building of national HIV/AIDS\nprograms  and  situation  analyses.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  in\ncollaboration  with  several  international  development  agencies  and  NGOs,  has  prepared  a\nsubregional strategy for HIV/AIDS prevention and care. The strategy recognizes the need to assist\nmobile populations. The strategy calls for coordinated action from all stakeholders. The United\nNations (UN) Task Force on Mobility and HIV/AIDS has been set up, and comprises representatives\nof the key international agencies, NGOs, and research organizations in the subregion. The Task", "3\nForce recognizes the need for greater support for HIV/AIDS prevention activities and preparing a\ncomprehensive plan for mobile populations in the subregion.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n9. The TA has three objectives:\n(i)  to  inform  key  policy  makers  and  international  agencies  about  the  migration  and\nmobility patterns,  characteristics of mobile populations and their vulnerabilities, and\nrisks related to HIV/AIDS;\n(ii)  to enhance capacities of the governments and related agencies to organize HIV/AIDS\nprevention activities by developing tool kits and guidelines for the following mobile\npopulations: (a) construction workers, (b) truck drivers, (c) migrant sex workers, and\n(d) seafarers; and\n(iii)  to  make  national  HIV/AIDS  programs  more  responsive  to  the  needs  of  mobile\npopulations by supporting a regional approach.\nB. Scope\n10. The TA objectives will be achieved through conducting studies (including five case studies), a\nliterature review, and a survey. The TA will be implemented in a participatory way, involving the key\ninternational agencies, NGOs, and the participating governments and communities.\n11. Literature Review and Background Analysis. In the first phase, the TA team will compile\nand collate information about mobility and migration. Available data and research findings in each\ncountry will be used to identify the individual and community-level characteristics of the mobile\npopulations; major migration routes; and location, approximate numbers, and density of mobile\npopulations in the subregion. The TA will identify major mobile groups that are vulnerable to behavior\nthat puts them at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and should be especially supported through\nnational programs. A typology of migrants will be prepared. Special attention will be paid to gender-\nbased differences in characteristics, behavior patterns, risks, and vulnerability. The TA will also\nidentify  the  reach  of  various  media.  The  TA  team  will  closely  coordinate  with  the  Transport,\nCommunication and Tourism Division of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\nPacific (ESCAP) for the information related to truck drivers, and with UNICEF for information related\nto seafarers.\n12. The  TA  team  will  review  the  existing  material  and  guidelines  for  organizing  HIV/AIDS\nprevention activities. Based on the available good practice examples and the review, the TA team\nwill develop draft tool kits for organizing HIV/AIDS prevention activities for (i) construction workers\n(and other unskilled migrant workers), (ii) truck drivers, (iii) migrant sex workers, and (iv) seafarers.\nThe draft tool kits and guidelines will be developed in consultation with all stakeholders including the\nbeneficiary groups, related NGOs and mass movement organizations, and international agencies.\nThe TA team will seek feedback and comments from the participating governments, the Bank, and\nthe members on the UN Task Force on Mobility and HIV/AIDS.", "4\n13. Field Testing of Draft Tool Kits and Guidelines. The draft tool kits will be field tested in\nareas of operational relevance for the Bank\u2019s work or that have large concentrations of mobile\npopulations. The field test areas may include\n(i)  for construction workers, the East-West Corridor, Lao PDR; and the Yuanjiang-Mohie\nsection of Kunming-Chiang Rai Highway, PRC;\n(ii)  for truck drivers, the East-West Corridor, Lao PDR (in collaboration with ESCAP and\nUNDP);\n(iii)  for migrant sex workers, Sway Pak Village of Cambodia; and\n(iv)  for seafarers, a fishing port in Viet Nam, to be decided  in consultation with UNICEF.\n14. In each field test, the impact of the intervention will be measured through surveys before and\nafter the test. Field tests will also provide information about the cost and required administrative\ncapacity for using the tool kits. Experience from each intervention will be documented as a case\nstudy and the draft tool kits will be finalized.\n15. Regional Strategy for Mobile Population. Based on the background research, experience\nwith the case studies, and other ongoing regional projects (particularly, the seafarers\u2019 study), the TA\nteam will develop a regional strategy for mobile populations. The plan will focus on areas that\nreceive or send migrants, or fall on major travel routes and their hinterlands in the region. It will\nspecifically target migrant workers working on large infrastructure projects, fishing fleets, and private\nsectors; truck drivers operating on international routes; and migrant sex workers. The plan  will\ninclude  concrete  and  feasible  activities  that  can  be  done  by  the  governments,  NGOs,  and\ninternational development agencies.\n16. Dissemination  and  Mainstreaming  of  the  Regional  Strategy.  In  the  last  phase,  the\nproposed strategy will be shared with the key policy makers and HIV/AIDS managers with a view to\nmainstream it in the national programs. The tool kits will be shared with key government officials and\nNGOs working on HIV/AIDS issues in all six GMS countries, and private sector establishments\nincluding factories that employ migrant workers and contractors for infrastructure projects. The TA\nteam  will  collaborate  with  NGOs  working  with  business  establishments.  The  objective  of  the\ndissemination workshops will be to bring the use of the tool kits into all HIV/AIDS activities and\nimprove the government and NGO capacity to organize HIV/AIDS prevention activities for mobile\npopulations. The workshops will also equip the participants with skills that will help them refine and\nadapt the tool kits to their specific needs. The TA will be implemented in collaboration with UNDP,\nwhich will support workshops, translation, and printing of tool kits into local languages in Cambodia,\nPRC, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. Dissemination activities in the PRC will be done at the national level.\nThe findings of the TA will also be disseminated through the Internet, by creating a special web site.\nThe experience of the TA will be shared and the regional plan for prevention of HIV/AIDS among\nmobile populations will be presented for approval in a GMS Human Resource Development Working\nGroup meeting.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $852,000. This will cover the cost of international and\ndomestic consultants\u2019 services, international and domestic travel, surveys and studies, preparation\nand field testing of tool kits, dissemination workshops, and monitoring and consultations. The Bank\nwill finance $450,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by the\nGovernment  of  Japan.  Cofinancing  of  $350,000  will  be  provided  by  the  Swedish  International", "5\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency (SIDA) on a joint untied basis.  UNDP will provide a parallel\ncofinancing of $52,000 for translation and printing of the tool kits and dissemination workshops.\nDetailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n18. The TA activities will be implemented over a 21 month period. Each participating country will\ndesignate focal points for the implementation  of  the  TA.  The  UN  Task  Force  on  Mobility  and\nHIV/AIDS  will  provide  technical  guidance  to  the  TA.  A  steering  committee  officials  from  the\nparticipating  countries  and  representatives  from  SIDA,  UNDP,  UNICEF,  the  Asia  Pacific  Inter-\nCountry Team (APICT) of UNAIDS and the Bank will guide the implementation of the TA.\n19. At least two meetings of the steering committee will be organized. An inception meeting (to\nbe organized in one of the participating countries) will introduce the consultants selected to the\nsteering committee. The consultants will discuss their proposed study design, time-frame, and the\nexpectations of the governments. Representatives from other funding agencies may be invited to the\ninception meeting. A midterm review meeting will be organized in one of the participating countries\nafter the tool kits have been field tested and the draft regional strategy prepared. The steering\ncommittee will provide comments on the draft strategy and finalize the plans for the second and third\nphases of the TA. A third meeting may be organized after the field test of the toolkits have been\ncompleted and draft regional plan prepared.\n20. The TA will commence in November 1999 and will be completed in August 2001. The team\nleader (of the consulting firm) will prepare a draft inception report within four weeks of the start of the\nstudy. The report will provide an action plan for implementation of the TA and the mechanism for\ncoordination with focal points in the participating governments, APICT, ESCAP, SIDA, UNDP, and\nUNICEF. The resulting report  will be presented to the steering committee during  the  inception\nmeeting. The team leader will finalize the report within two weeks after the meeting.\n21. The Bank will engage (i) two international consultants: a public health expert/team leader (for\n12 person-months) and an HIV/AIDS expert (6 person-months); (ii) two regional consultants: a\nmigration expert (4 person-months) and an information education and communication expert (6\nperson-months);  and  (iii)  four  domestic  consultants  (32  person-months)  to  serve  as  country\ncoordinators.  The outline terms of reference for the consultants are available in Appendix 3. The\nservices of the consultants will be packaged and engaged by the Bank through a firm (preferably a\nregional  NGO,  with  field  offices  in  all  participating  countries)  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants satisfactory to the Bank, using the Bank\u2019s simplified technical proposal procedures.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the Bank\nadministering a portion of technical assistance to be financed by the Government of Sweden on a\ngrant basis in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000, and (ii) the provision of the\nbalance of technical assistance to be financed by the Bank on a grant basis in an amount not\nexceeding the equivalent of $450,000, both for the purpose of Preventing HIV/AIDS among Mobile\nPopulations in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Assumptions & Risks\nMechanisms\nGoal\nReduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS Number of new cases of HIV National surveillance \u2022  Mobile populations\nin the Greater Mekong Subregion infection will decrease over systems. constitute one of the\n(GMS) countries. time. major HIV/AIDS\ninfected group.\n\u2022  Effective HIV/AIDS\nprevention activities can\nbe organized for mobile\npopulations.\n\u2022  The issue of mobility\ncan be more effectively\ndealt with through a\nregional approach.\nObjectives\n\u2022  Inform key policy makers and \u2022  Key policy makers and \u2022  Evaluation report of \u2022  Key policy makers are\ninternational agencies about international agencies dissemination able to attend the\nthe migration patterns and will have a clearer workshops. national or regional\ncharacteristics of mobile picture of the mobility \u2022  Number of times the workshops\npopulations and their patterns and HIV/AIDS Internet page of the \u2022  Concerned agencies\nvulnerabilities to HIV/AIDS. risks and vulnerabilities mobility report is and organizations have\nfaced by mobile accessed. access to the Internet.\npopulations. \u2022  Demand for extra \u2022  Governments are\ncopies of the report convinced that\nfrom the policy makers HIV/AIDS is one of their\nand international major development\nagencies. challenges.\n\u2022  Feedback from the\ngovernments and\ninternational agencies.\n\u2022  Enhance capacity of the \u2022  Tool kits and guidelines \u2022  Number of externally- \u2022  Tool kits will be flexible\ngovernments, related for organizing HIV/AIDS funded projects using and will be able to\nagencies, and the private prevention activities will the tool kits. adapt to changing\nsector for organizing HIV/AIDS be used by all large \u2022  Number of government needs over time.\nprevention activities for (i) infrastructure projects, and NGO projects \u2022  Tool kits will be easily\nconstruction workers, (ii)  truck and most using the tool kits. accessible.\ndrivers, (iii) migrant sex nongovernment \u2022  Number of  times the \u2022  Case studies will clearly\nworkers, and (iv) seafarers. organizations (NGOs) tool kits page is demonstrate that tool\nand government accessed. kits can be useful in\nprojects working with \u2022  Demand for extra organizing effective\ntruck drivers, sex copies of tool kits.
