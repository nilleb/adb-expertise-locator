This technical assistance (TA)1 was originally included in the Country Strategy and \nProgram 2002\u20132004 as advisory TA for 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a performance-\nbased monitoring and evaluation system in the Government of the Maldives to improve its \nprovision of high-quality public services. In September 2004, a brief capacity development \nassessment for the Public Service Division (PSD) was conducted by an Asian Development \nBank (ADB) staff consultant.2 As agreed with the Government, the proposed TA was later \nincluded in the Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006. The Fact-Finding Mission \nwas conducted in September 2005, and TA was developed based on recommendations in the \nassessment report, as agreed with the Government. TA will assist in strengthening governance \nand improving the efficiency and quality of service delivery in the public sector. It will prepare a \nplan to establish a Government Public Service Training Center (PSTC) and help increase the \nknowledge and improve the skills of PSD staff members, as well as of staff members of selected \nministries, in modern human resource management and organizational development concepts \nand processes. In addition, TA will prepare a strategic reform plan for performance-oriented \npublic service. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government and government-owned companies (mainly in community, social, and \npersonal services; manufacturing; hotels and restaurants; and fishing) are the largest employers \nin  the  Maldives.3 At  the  end  of  2004,  total  public  sector  employment  stood  at  26,242, \nrepresenting 12% of total labor force and showing an increase of about 8% over 2003, with the \nlargest increase in the government service sector. About 25 percent of public service employees \nare scattered on some 199 islands. \n \n3.  PSD was established in 1999 as part of the President\u2019s Office and took over the work of \nthe Employment Affairs Section of the President\u2019s Office and the National Office for Personnel \nand Administrative Reform. PSD\u2019s mandate is derived from the Presidential Reform Agenda \n2004 and Vision 2020, charging it to institute reform priorities consistent with the principles of \ngood  governance  and  establish  a  performance-  and  results-oriented  public  service.  This \nachievement  will  require  a  substantive  and  significant  change  to  the  work  culture  of  the \nMaldives public service, with advisory and development support from internal and external \nhuman  resource  management  and  organizational  development  specialists.  The  successful \nachievement of this mandate depends upon a major investment in development and training \nprograms, technical assistance in specialized areas of public sector reform, and a demonstrable \ncommitment from executive officers of the public service and the Government to a substantive \nand well-planned management-change program.  \n \n4.  PSD currently has seven units: (i) Human Resource Development and Training, (ii) \nPersonnel, (iii) Public Service Policy, (iv) Information Systems, (v) Modernization and Planning, \n(vi) Research and Publications/Library and (vii) Administrative and Support Services. (Three \nfurther units are planned.) With only 30 staff members, PSD clearly lacks sufficient resources to \nservice a large and widely scattered public service. Moreover, 17 of these staff members, \nincluding a director and a deputy director, are employed in the Personnel Unit, which inherited \nthe administrative processes and procedures of the Employment Affairs Section in 1999. The \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 September 2005. \n2  Ruhen, David. 2004. Capacity Building Assessment of the Public Service Division. ADB: Manila. \n3  The other main employers are tourism and fisheries.  \n ", "2   \nModernization and Planning Unit (MPU) employs six staff members, including one director. This \nleaves other units of PSD badly understaffed. \n \n5.  Under the current rules of public service administration, Government offices are not \nsubject  to  clear  rules  of  accountability  for  performance.  Internal  processes  of  personnel \nmanagement, such as recruitment, promotions, and transfers, are not open and transparent. \nTherefore, to implement its mandate, PSD needs new codes of civil service administration and \npersonnel management, under which responsibility and accountability for performance are more \nclearly defined. An additional need is to strengthen the work ethic of Government employees \nand  restructure  the  ministries  to  enable  them  to  accept  authority  with  accountability. \nBureaucratic processes need to be simplified, and new measures need to be introduced to \nenhance public service efficiency and reduce the cost of running the Government. As the reform \nagent within Maldives\u2019 public sector, PSD will be expected to help ministries implement these \nreforms,  but  performing  this  task  will  first  require  substantial  capacity  development  and \nstrengthening of PSD. \n \n6.  The need for strengthening PSD was recognized in the sixth national development plan \n(2000\u20132005), which cited a need to strengthen and streamline PSD to modernize and improve \nthe efficiency of public service delivery. The seventh national development plan (2006\u20132010), \nnow under preparation, is expected to confirm the important role of PSD, especially after the \nlatest Cabinet reshuffle in July and August 2005.  \n \n7.  The core business of the reform agenda is largely the responsibility of both PSD\u2019s \nHuman Resource Development Training Unit and MPU, which have conducted a number of \nworkshops  to  familiarize  public  sector  employees  with  the  concepts  of  accountability  and \nperformance requirements typical of modern personnel management practices. These include \nstrategic planning and designing appropriate action plans to achieve agreed objectives, as well \nas modern methods of performance appraisal. The unit recognizes that a number of ministries \nrequire support to implement the new procedures in their personnel management practices. A \nplanning  and  performance  appraisal  specialist  has  mentored  staff  and  provided  interactive \nhands-on work with various ministries as needed.  \n \n8.  Although  staff  members  of  MPU  are  qualified,  capable,  and  highly  motivated,  their \ncollective capacity to carry out the mandate of their unit over the whole of the public service is \nseverely deficient. The unit\u2019s efforts to date have been well received, but the need is widely \nrecognized  to  strengthen  its  capacity  and  capability  to  ensure  that  sufficient  professional \nresources are available to help all the ministries implement personnel reforms and assess the \neffectiveness of various reform strategies. The scope of the proposed reforms is substantive \nand encompasses all of the recognized areas of human resource management and organization \ndevelopment.  Related  work  demands  on  the  resources  of  PSD  and  the  ministries  will  be \nsignificant.  At  present,  there  is  neither  sufficient  capacity  nor  appropriate  capability  in  the \nministries or PSD for the mandate to be successfully carried out. Advancing the reform agenda \nwill require building the capacity and capability for reform in both PSD and the ministries. In this \nconnection, PSD needs to develop a comprehensive strategic reform plan to guide reform \ncoordinators as they carry out their roles in their agencies.    \n \n9.  MPU will require access to a broad range of human resource management skills likely to \ninclude (i) performance management of organizations and individuals, (ii) remuneration rules, (iii) \njob  classification  and  grading,  (iv)  workforce  planning,  (v)  grievance  management,  (vi) \nperformance appraisal, (vii) recruitment and selection, and (viii) training and development. The \nunit will also require organization development skills covering (i) organization design; (ii) job \n ", "  3\nanalysis, design, and description; (iii) rightsizing; (iv) devolution; (v) organization performance \nassessment; (vi) comparative benchmarking; (vii) regulatory requirements; and (viii) strategic \nplanning. Efficient use of limited resources for TA requires maximal use of domestic training \nconducted by foreign and domestic resource persons.  \n \n10.  No training center exists within the public sector to meet the priority in-house training \nneeds of the public service. New recruits into the public service in the Maldives are appointed \nwith little or no work experience or training. Some such appointments are made at levels high \nenough to incorporate responsibility for the performance of others. A high-priority demand exists \nfor a substantive PSTC as well as suitable training programs to equip inexperienced recruits \nand allow them to be effective upon entry into the service.  \n \n11.  All of the points raised above illustrate the significant need for strengthening the capacity \nof PSD and the ministries to enable the implementation of the public sector reform agenda \nenvisaged by the sixth national development plan. The proposed intervention at the organization \nlevel  is  the  first  step  toward  better  service  delivery.  Further  appropriate  action  linking  the \norganizations and their frontline service providers will need to be undertaken by the Government. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The longer-term impact of TA will be improved efficiency and quality of public service \ndelivery that contributes to good governance. The main intended outcome is PSD personnel \nand  trainers\u2019  improved  human  resource  management  and  organizational  development \ncapacities. Specifically, TA will help PSD (i) develop a performance-oriented strategic reform \nplan, (ii) increase the knowledge and improve the skills of its staff, and the staff of ministries, \nregarding modern human resource management and organizational development concepts and \nprocesses, and (iii) prepare guidelines for establishing the PSTC and developing its curriculum.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  TA will be organized into three components: \n(i)   Component 1 will develop \n(a)  a strategic reform plan for building a performance oriented public service, \n(b)  an activity-based, output-driven action plan to guide implementation of the \nstrategic reform plan for building a performance-oriented public service, \nand \n(c)  a performance management system with particular emphasis on the link \nbetween individual and organizational performance and an appropriate \nreward system. \n(ii)  Component 2 will arrange and implement \n(a)  short-term (maximum 6 month) overseas training for PSD staff, especially \nincluding grievance management and job classification and grading, and \n(b)  in-country training courses in selected human resource management and \norganizational  development  skills  for  PSD  and  reform  coordinators  in \nministries. \n(iii)  Component 3 will  \n(a)  prepare a strategic plan to establish a viable and independent PSTC to \nservice high-priority training needs within the public sector and,  \n ", "4   \n(b)   based on consultations with concerned stakeholders, propose a detailed \nbasic training curriculum for the center. \n \n14.  Ensuring acceptance from the wider public service will require that the ministries have \nsignificant input into the development of the strategic plan. Line ministries have to understand \nthe integrated relationships between the outputs that are to be delivered at various stages of \nimplementation. It is envisaged that capacity-developing activities in public services will be \nprovided through local, short-term training of PSD and line ministry staff members and through \nsystematic reviews and monitoring of PSD. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $295,000 equivalent, comprising $229,000 in foreign \nexchange and $66,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $250,000 equivalent, \ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost and $21,000 of the local currency cost. TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining $45,000 equivalent mainly through contributions in-kind for office accommodation, \ncounterpart  support  services,  administrative  and  logistic  support,  and  other  services.  The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the Executing Agency, and PSD will be the \nImplementing  Agency.  The  Government\u2019s  Members  of  the  Network  of  Senior  Government \nOfficials will oversee TA implementation and resolve any issues related to policies, legislation, \nand coordinating international cooperation aid. PSD will appoint a focal point for TA to assume a \nsupportive, coordinating, and facilitating role. It will coordinate and supervise TA activities and \nprovide TA coordinators and counterpart staff with office space and facilities. PSD will be \nresponsible  for  coordinating,  directing,  and  monitoring  the  activities  of  consultants  and \ncounterpart staff, as well as for procuring equipment and/or training materials. It will ensure that \nequipment acquired under TA for training, workshops, and seminars will be available for use by \nconsultants during TA. An equipment list will be prepared by PSD and consultants for ADB \napproval. The equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand turned over to PSD upon completion of TA. \n \n17.  TA is expected to be implemented over a period of 12 months, starting in March 2006 \nwith fielding consultants, and completed before April 2007. The core activities that require \nconsultants\u2019 input will be carried out over a 6-month period. Overseas studies and local training \ncourses will be arranged to fit within a 1-year period with possible variations depending on the \navailability of courses selected.4 TA will engage two international consultants for a total of 5 \nperson-months  with  expertise  in  (i)  public  service  human  resource  management  and \norganization  development,  and  (ii)  public  service  management  and  education.  It  will  also \nengage  one  domestic  consultant  for  a  total  3  person-months  with  expertise  in  strategic \nmanagement  and  education.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough a firm and selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of consultants. The \nmethodology and terms of reference for TA are specific and clearly identified. Hence, ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for simplified technical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection will be used. \n                                                 \n4  If possible, PSD staff selected for the external training will be included as resource persons during the domestic \nworkshops and training. \n ", "  5\n18.  The international consultants will work closely with PSD to develop the strategic reform \nplan, identify international training programs, and conduct local training programs for PSD and \nministries staff. The list of training programs, training institutions, and staff members selected for \ninternational  training  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  before  the  proposed  training \nprograms are implemented. ADB will be responsible for (i) the general administration and \nsupervision of TA, (ii) consultant selection and contract administration, and (iii) review and \napproval of international training programs. TA will be implemented in close coordination with \nline  ministries  and  other  funding  agencies,  especially  the  World  Bank  and  United  Nations \nagencies. \n \nIV.
