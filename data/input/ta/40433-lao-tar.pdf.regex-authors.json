INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR) has requested \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nthe health sector program approach. The TA will develop the program planning and funding \nmechanism  and  improve  financial  management  for  the  sector  program  approach  at  the \nprovincial and district levels, including for ADB's Health Sector Development Program (HSDP).1 \nThe country operations business plan, 2009\u20132011 includes a grant of $500,000 in 2009 for the \nTA project.2 The ADB fact-finding mission for the TA was fielded from 27 April to 1 May 2009. \nThe government has confirmed the proposed TA scope and implementation arrangements.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Lao PDR has made substantial progress in health-related Millennium Development \nGoals. The child mortality rate dropped from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and \n2005, and the maternal mortality ratio fell from 750 to 405 per 100,000 live births in the same \nperiod. However, about 30% of children are still underweight, and progress in communicable \ndisease control including of HIV/AIDS has been steady but slow. \n \n3.  The 6th National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010)5 of the Lao PDR has \nidentified the health sector as one of four priority sectors to reduce poverty and achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals by 2015. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is committed to provide \nall citizens access to primary health care (PHC) and has built a substantial PHC network since \n2000. \n \n4.  However, use of the PHC network remains low. Total outpatient visits are only one third \nof the expected demand for services, and the bed occupancy rate averages about 40%. The \nMOH is facing major challenges in improving the return on past investments by increasing the \nuse  of  the  PHC  network,  and  thereby  making  it  more  efficient  and  effective.  Access  and \naffordability problems for the poor, and the quality of care, are some of the factors responsible \nfor the low demand. The PHC network has become more accessible by upgrading hospitals, \nadding health centers, training village health volunteers, providing revolving drug kits, and \ndeveloping model healthy villages.6 The acceptability of services, in particular for women and \nethnic groups, is improving through training of, for example, skilled birth attendants and PHC \nworkers from ethnic groups. However, the quality and working conditions of health workers \nneeds major improvement, and a policy on human resources for health has been drafted. High \nout-of-pocket payments and transport costs also make the network unaffordable for many. \nHealth equity funds are being piloted, but coverage remains limited. Overall, staff and budget \nconstraints seriously hamper the quality and affordability of health services. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Vientiane. \n6  A model healthy village is defined as a village that maintains basic conditions needed to lead a healthy life.    \n ", "2   \n5.  With high levels of poverty, public spending on health is critical. However, domestic \nspending on salaries and non-wage recurrent costs has been low, constraining the delivery of \nPHC and burdening the poor. Based on 2005 data, only about 30% of the $19 per person per \nyear spent on health care is financed by the government and its partners, while the remainder is \nout-of-pocket. The government's fiscal situation will remain tight and will require bridge funding  \nuntil revenue from hydropower and other sources becomes substantial by about 2020.  \n \n6.  Several  underlying  factors  contribute  to  substandard  sector  performance:  (i)  past \ninvestments focused on infrastructure rather than service delivery, and generally were input- \nrather than results-driven; (ii) projects and vertical programs were not integrated or adapted to \nlocal  capacity,  and  used  different  indicators  and  reporting  and  financial  systems,  thereby \ndemanding a disproportionate share of staff time; and (iii) management responsibilities were \ntypically fragmented, with local health officers lacking the authority to make adjustments in \nimplementing these programs according to local needs and conditions.  \n \n7.  The government has begun to address these challenges at several levels. ADB, the \nWorld Bank, and other development partners are supporting macroeconomic stability and public \nexpenditure reforms. Public sector fundamentals are being improved, such as through the \npassage of the Budget Law, 2006 and support for the medium-term expenditure framework.7 \nThe Poverty Reduction Strategic Operations of the World Bank and other partners provide \nbudget support for poverty reduction.8   \n \n8.  Within the sector, the MOH is implementing the Sixth Health Sector Development Plan \n(2006\u20132010)  and  is  preparing  the  Seventh  Health  Sector  Development  Plan  (2011\u20132015). \nThese plans are based on the strategic directions of the Central Committee, and incorporate all \ndistrict and provincial 5-year plans through a bottom-up planning process. The seventh plan will \nbe based on the eight sector priorities identified during the midterm review of the sixth plan. In \naddition, the MOH has prepared a wide range of subsector policies with considerable technical \nand financial implications. Provincial 5-year plans, prepared under earlier assistance, were \ninitially based on need. These plans must be prioritized, clearly linked with available resources, \nand implemented through results-based annual operational plans and budgets. \n \n9.  Under  the  Minister  of  Health\u2019s  leadership,  external  aid  has  also  been  aligned.  For \nexample, ADB, Lux-Development, and the World Bank are supporting provincial health services \nand  health  financing  with  similar  interventions  in,  respectively,  the  northern,  middle,  and \nsouthern provinces. To improve sector efficiency further and identify funding gaps, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and the World Health Organization are leading the partners in \ndeveloping  sector-wide  coordination.  A  coordination  framework  is  in  place  with  policy, \noperational, and technical working groups. The MOH has set up technical working groups for \nhealth financing, human resources for health, and PHC to help formulate reforms. \n \n10.  In line with the Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,9 the MOH is developing the \nsector program approach to improve sector performance and financing further. The Seventh \nHealth Sector Development Plan will serve as a platform for program support. The annual \nplanning cycle will drive the implementation of the program approach.

ADB\u2019s  Health  System \nDevelopment Project,10 approved in 2007, is helping the MOH to make the building blocks for a \nsector  program,  including  the  preparation  of  largely  need-based  5-year  plans  at  central, \nprovincial, and district levels. However, the program support mechanism has just been initiated.  \n \n11.  Under  the  decentralized  system  introduced  in  2000,  provincial  authorities  are \nresponsible for financing recurrent health expenditures from provincial revenues. Most provincial \nauthorities face serious fiscal constraints, and their allocations for recurrent spending on health \nare low and largely absorbed by salaries. External demand for staff increases and counterpart \nfunding for investment further reduced provincial spending on health services delivery. MOH \nwants to increase recurrent budget support for the sector. This requires a new flow of funds \nmechanism between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and MOH, as well as greater capacity of the \nprovincial and district authorities in program planning and financial management.  \n \n12.  The  recently  approved  HSDP  provides  policy  and  project  support  in  three  areas: \nplanning and financing; maternal, neonatal, and child health (MNCH); and human resources for \nhealth (footnote 1). In addition, the MOF and MOH have agreed to pass on program funds for \nrecurrent budget support to the provincial and district health offices, allowing provincial and \ndistrict  authorities  flexibility  in  spending  based  on  certain  procedures  to  be  followed.  For \nexample, the provincial authorities may decide to use program funds to improve service delivery, \nor to roll out MNCH services, the health equity funds, and the model healthy village. The \nprogram funds will double the non-salary recurrent budget for the provinces, which constitutes a \nsubstantial challenge for the provincial authorities. \n \n13.  Three challenges need to be addressed jointly to introduce provincial program funding. \nFirst, the capacity of provincial teams will need to be strengthened to set provincial priorities \nbased on policies and resources, improve annual operational plans and budgets, and request \nfor program support to help fill financing gaps. Second, a flow of funds mechanism needs to be \nestablished for program support from MOF to the provincial and district health offices, based on \ncertain eligibility criteria and budget norms. While MOF has agreed to the mechanism, the \ndetails of the flow of funds need to be prepared. Third, while provincial and district health offices \nhave build up capacity in financial management of projects, this needs to be improved further for \nthe program approach. \n \n14.  ADB's support for the Lao PDR health sector is in line with Strategy 202011 and the \noperational plan for health,12 supporting program-based sector support, sector reforms, and \npartnerships. Improved provincial and district health planning and financial management have \nmany benefits, including greater transparency and accountability in the sector, more efficiency \nand effectiveness, and better targeting of vulnerable groups. The program funding mechanism \nwill facilitate more supplementary funding for operations and maintenance, and the rollout of \npro-poor interventions such as MNCH-friendly services, health equity funds, and the model \nhealthy village.  \n \n \n \n \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m0 AemDBb.e 2rs0,0 B7.o Raerdp oorft  Danirde cRteocrso,m Mmaennadagteiomn eonf t,t hoer  Pstraesffi,d aenntd t om tahye  bBeo aprrde loimf Diniarercyt oinrs n: aPtruorpeo.s  ed Grant to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Health System Development Project.

The overall impact of the TA will be greater efficiency of targeted health services in three \npilot provinces.13 The outcome will be improved availability and allocation of funds for provincial \nhealth services.14 The three outputs will be (i) stronger provincial and district health office \ncapacity in program planning, (ii) an operational funds flow mechanism, and (iii) better financial \nmanagement at provincial and district health offices. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will develop the details of the program approach, which will be piloted in three \nprovinces.  Under  the  first  output,  provincial  and  district  planning  and  budgeting  will  be \nstrengthened. As shown in Appendix 2, the TA will support the provinces to move from needs-\nbased 5-year plans to policy and resource-based 5-year plans, annual plans and budgets, and \nprograms. Appendix 2 further shows the complementarity of the TA with the Health System \nDevelopment  Project  and  the  HSDP.  The  TA  will  engage  a  consulting  firm  to  work  with \ngovernment counterparts to (i) conduct a desk review and summarize the quality, applicability, \nand  use  of  current  provincial  health  plans;  (ii)  consult  provincial  authorities  and  other \nstakeholders on any program planning issues; (iii) develop draft provincial and district health \nprogram  planning  guidelines  and  standards  based  on  government  requirements;  (iv)  seek \nsupport  from  stakeholders  through  consultations  and  a  national  workshop;  (v)  finalize  the \nprogram planning design for the health sector; (vi) design, prepare, and implement a training \nprogram for provincial health planners in three provinces; and (vii) monitor program planning \nperformance in the three provinces.  \n \n17.  Under  the  first  tranche  release  policy  actions  of  the  HSDP,  the  MOF  approved  a \nmemorandum of understanding with the MOH, providing the overall mechanism for the flow of \nprogram funds from the MOF to the provincial and district health offices using the conditional \ngrant system. This flow of funds mechanism needs to be developed and operationalized. The \nconsultant and counterpart will (i) review and validate the assessment of financial management \ncapacity of the provincial and district health offices initiated under the project preparatory TA;15 \n(ii) review relevant laws, policies, and guidelines of the MOF and others regarding the flow of \nfunds to provinces and districts; (iii) develop a draft design for the flow of funds, including the \napproval process, eligibility criteria, and budget norms; (iv) seek support from stakeholders \nthrough consultations and a national workshop; (v) finalize the flow of funds mechanism; (vi) \nfacilitate MOF approval of the flow of funds mechanism; and (vii) faciilitate and supervise \nimplementation in three provinces.  \n \n18.  A detailed assessment of the provincial and district financial management capacities \nwas carried out under the project preparatory TA for the HSDP. This assessment showed \nseveral  weaknesses  in  financial  management  in  the  health  sector.  The  consultant  and \ncounterpart will (i) validate this assessment through selective field visits; (ii) review relevant laws, \npolicies, and guidelines of MOF and others, and ongoing TA for capacity building for provincial \nand district financial management; (iii) identify key issues and gaps that need to be addressed in \nfinancial management in the health sector; (iv) develop draft provincial and district financial \nmanagement practices and standards based on government requirements and international \n                                                 \n13  Representing northern, central, and southern Lao PDR, and different planning capacities and funding sources.  \n14 ADB. 2008.

Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $520,000. ADB will finance the equivalent of $500,000. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The government will contribute $20,000 in kind for counterpart staff, office space, and \nlocal transport. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The MOH,  through the Department of Planning and Finance, will be the executing \nagency,  responsible  for  overall  TA  implementation  and  coordination.  The  MOH  steering  \ncommittee headed by the Minister of Health will direct TA implementation and will ensure that \nthe MOF and the Ministry of Planning and Investment are kept informed and involved, as \nneeded. The project director will provide overall leadership and chair weekly team meetings to \nguide and coordinate TA activities. The deputy project director will provide day-to-day guidance \nand arrange consultations with ministries, provincial authorities and health offices, and partners. \nThe MOH has offered adequate office space and utilities for the TA project. \n \n21.  The TA project will require 11 person-months of international consulting services and 40 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  international  consultants  will  include  a \nhealth  planning  expert  (6  person-months)  and  a  financial  management  expert  (5  person-\nmonths). The national consultants will include a public health expert (10 person-months), and \nthree financial management experts (10 person-months each). The consultants will be engaged \nthrough  a  firm  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal  and  fixed  budget  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 4. The MOH will procure \nequipment for the TA project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The equipment will be retained by the MOH on completion of the \nTA  project.  Funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.16  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010. The MOH, \nMOF, and ADB will conduct joint monitoring at the inception, midterm, and final stages of the TA \nproject. The consultants will provide the MOH and ADB with an inception report after 1 month, a \nmidterm report after 5 months, a draft final report after 11 months, and a final report upon \ncompletion of the TA project. The consultants will also submit monthly progress reports stating \npast and proposed activities.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.
