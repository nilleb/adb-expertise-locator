INTRODUCTION \n1.   After growing at around 10% per year on average for a decade until 2008, Armenia\u2019s \neconomy has been devastated by the global economic crisis. Its real gross domestic product is \nforecast to decline by more than 15% in 2009. With the crisis at least partially eroding the gains \nof past growth, sustainable growth over the medium term in Armenia will have to be predicated \non boosting the competitiveness of the economy and attracting private sector investments. In \nthe  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2007\u20132008  produced  by  the  World  Economic  Forum, \nArmenia was ranked 93rd out of 131 countries in the Global Competitiveness Index and 108th \nout of 127 countries in the Business Competitiveness Index.1 While Armenia has fared better in \nthe World Bank's Doing Business2 rankings, moving from a global rank of 50 in 2009 to 43 in \n2010 in terms of ease of doing business, it wants to improve the quality as well as the speed of \nbusiness  registration  to  further  attract  investments.  The  proposed  capacity  development \ntechnical assistance (TA) will help Armenia strengthen the State Registry Agency (SRA) in \nproviding  better  services  and  increasing  access  to  information  on  Armenian  businesses. \nAppendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Rational public and private investment decisions need accurate and timely disclosure of \ninformation  relating  to  the  financial  condition  of  institutions.  As  a  Soviet-era  legacy,  such \ninformation was skewed to the needs of the state rather than to the institutions' stakeholders.4 In \n2007\u20132008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a governance, institutional, and \ncorruption  risk  assessment5 for  Armenia,  which  covered  (i)  public  financial  management,          \n(ii) procurement, and (iii) combating corruption at the central government level. These were \nimportant steps in improving governance in the public sector, but their effectiveness requires \nconcurrent measures in the private sector. Armenia recognizes the importance of good financial \ngovernance standards in improving its investment climate.6 Post-crisis, it will be even more \nimportant  to  restore  investments,  including  foreign  direct  investment.  From  2000  to  2008, \nArmenia\u2019s net foreign direct investment was in the range of 7%\u20138% of gross domestic product, \nbut it is forecast to decline to less than 5% in 2009\u20132010. Increasing private sector participation \nand  investments  requires  information  on  business  opportunities.  Sustaining  private  sector \ndevelopment is high on the government's reform agenda and is the main driver for sustained \ngrowth under the second poverty reduction strategy paper (2008\u20132021).  \n \n3.  In line with these plans, the Government of Armenia is pursuing an ambitious plan \ntowards  becoming  a  center  of  excellence  in  governance  generally,  and  in  improving  the \nbusiness environment and reducing the cost of doing business in particular. An action plan to \nthis effect has been issued by the Prime Minister.7 A major segment of this reform deals with \nincreasing efficiency and simplifying the procedures in the SRA through two initiatives: (i) full \n                                                 \n1  Economy  and  Values  Research  Center.  2008.

Available: \nhttp://www.ev.am \n2  Doing Business. http://www.doingbusiness.org \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2008. \n4  Information was geared to the needs of the State Committee on Statistics, taxation authorities, and the Ministry of \nSocial Maintenance. As a consequence, information about a corporation\u2019s ownership structure or managerial \nremuneration is not easily available to an entity\u2019s other stakeholders. \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n6   At present, the stock market capitalization to gross domestic product ratio is 0.8% for Armenia. \n7  Issued by the Prime Minister on 28 July 2008. The action plan seeks to improve most of the areas covered by the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Doing Business assessments.   \n ", "2   \nautomation,  so  that  the  current  system  of  manual  registration  is  computerized;  and                        \n(ii) establishing a one-window operation to facilitate business start-up. In addition to the time \nspent in the SRA and organizing facilities such as utility connections, businesses apply for \ngetting titles cleared from the Patents Offices and separately file to get tax numbers from the \nState Tax Service. The action plan envisages setting up 10 \"business facilitation centers\" to \nhandle all the tasks under one roof in coordination with the relevant agencies. It needs to be \nassessed if they would need to be new entities, upgraded regional offices of the SRA, or \noutsourced operations. The Ministry of Justice and the SRA have prepared a program for \nsimplification of the functions and processes of the SRA. The proposed TA is in response to the \ngovernment's request for support to establish an online business registry as part of this program.  \n \n4.  Online business registry. Armenia has a civil law tradition based on that of the former \nSoviet  Union.  It  has  various  types  of  commercial  legal  entities.  These  include  business \npartnerships  in  the  form  of  a  general  partnership  or  a  limited  partnership,  and  business \ncompanies in the form of limited liability companies, companies with supplementary liability, and \njoint-stock companies (open joint-stock company or closed joint-stock company). Transparent \nand efficient systems for registration of businesses are key to strong and sound governance, \nparticularly in the corporate sector. The SRA is responsible for the registration of businesses or \ncommercial legal entities8 (with the exception of banks and loan companies) and individual \nentrepreneurs; it consists of a central body based in Yerevan and 49 regional branches.9 As of \n2009, starting a business in Armenia takes 15 days, including 7 days for registration at the \nSRA.10 The Law on the Unified State Register defines the procedures for public access to \ninformation and state that the SRA has to respond to any request within 5 days. \n \n5.  In its present state, the Armenian business registration system is totally manual and is \ncharacterized by outdated procedures. Since local branches are not linked to the central body, a \nbranch cannot deal with a request for information on a legal entity outside its jurisdiction and \n                                                 \n8  \u201cUsually the basic legal documents for all legal entities are filed with the business registry. These can include not \nonly joint-stock companies, and limited liability companies but also sole proprietorships, cooperatives, farms, as \nwell as nongovernment organizations. Easy access to the registry allows businesses, lawyers, and bankers to \neasily check a company\u2019s legal form, its share capital, the authorized representatives, members of the boards of \ndirectors and its founders. The business registries also have copies of companies\u2019 charters (statutes) and in most \ncountries their annual financial reports.\u201d World Bank. 2007. Armenian Business Registry. Draft Report. Washington \nDC. In Armenia, the number of such enterprises under the business registry has grown from 89,000 in 1999 to \n123,000 in 2008. As of 2008, these include 64,000 sole proprietorships, 944 open joint-stock companies, 3,198 \nclosed joint-stock companies, and 39,221 limited liability companies. \n9  Each branch covers a specific region and maintains its own business register. The registration information is \nforwarded to the central body (head office) and the details are entered into a national register\u2014the Unified State \nRegister. The branches maintain their own paper-based local register and head office maintains the computer-\nbased unified register. Submission of forms and documents are held at head office in paper format only. There are \neight branches in Yerevan, and a staff of 149.  \n10  The Law on State Registration of Legal Entities, 2001 stipulates that the SRA must register a company in 5 days. \nThe 2010 Doing Business Report on Armenia (The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. 2009. \nDoing Business 2010 Armenia. http://www.doingbusiness.org/Documents/CountryProfiles/ARM.pdf) indicates that \nit takes 6\u20137 days. In practice, there are 7\u20139 procedures involved in starting a business: (i) registering the name of \nthe company at the State Patent Department through the State Registrar (2 days), (ii) procuring a written statement \nof deposited charter capital at a bank (1 day), (iii) procuring a registration card from the State Registry Office and \nfilling it out (1 day), (iv) paying the registration fee at any bank (1 day), (v) registering with the State Registrar              \n(7 days), (vi) registering with tax authorities and obtaining a tax identification number (2 days), (vii) obtaining a right \nat the National Police Department to order a seal for all official company transactions (1 day), (viii) ordering a seal \n(2 days), and (ix) registering with the statistical office (1 day).  \n ", "  3\nmust refer the request to head office.11 The system does contain the register information as \nprescribed by  law  and  in  line  with  standard European  Union  practices,  and  can  therefore \nbecome  the  foundation  for  an  effective  and  efficient  online  electronic  registry  (Armenian \nBusiness Registry report, footnote 8). The existing business registration processes suffer from \nall the weaknesses of a manual paper-based system, including cumbersome procedures for \nstarting a business, and weak reporting. The SRA has a website which gives useful information \non laws and legal requirements. However, it does not provide services such as downloadable \nand online forms, register searches, etc.  \n \n6.  In 2003, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) developed a \nnew technological system and implemented network connectivity for the SRA and its 49 local \nbranches. This initiative has not been sustained due to unreliability of the dial-up network at that \ntime and the lack of experienced and trained personnel to manage and maintain the software \nonce the staff initially trained left the organization. Since 2003, Armenia's e-readiness index has \nimproved  from  0.37  to  0.41  as  of  2008,  mainly  because  of  improved  government  online \npresence  (web  measure)  and  slight  amelioration  of  the  telecommunication  infrastructure \n(infrastructure measure).12   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be an improved business climate. The outcome will be an \nefficient and transparent online business registry that will in turn meet two goals: (i) reduce the \nbusiness registration time at the SRA from 7 days to 3 days; and (ii) improve information \ndissemination with respect to registered legal entities, which will help attract investments.13 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support the introduction of an online business registry and will make the \nprocess of business registration efficient by reducing the time taken to register companies as \nwell  as  improving  access  to,  and  transparency  of,  information  about  companies. 14  An \norganization  and  business  redesign  study  will  be  conducted  to seek  the  most appropriate \ntechnological model for the online business registry in the SRA. This study would examine the \n                                                 \n11 The TA preparatory mission visited the SRA and one of its regional offices in Yerevan. While computers are \navailable, only the head office has some software, and it is generally outdated. The mission was told that in the \nregional and Marze offices the computers are also old and need replacing. The paper-based data is stacked in files \nand wooden cabinets in partitioned rooms and corridors with wooden walls and floors with little fire protection. \n12  United Nations. 2008.  United Nations e-Government Survey 2008. New York. The United Nations e-Government \nReadiness Index is a composite index comprising the web measure index, the telecommunication infrastructure \nindex, and the human capital index.  The web measure index is based upon a five-stage model, which builds upon \nthe previous levels of sophistication of a country's online presence. As a country migrates upwards through the \nvarious stages, it is ranked higher in the web measure index.  The telecommunication infrastructure index is a \ncomposite index of five primary indices relating to a country\u2019s infrastructure capacity as they relate to the delivery of \ne-government services.  The human capital index is a composite of the adult literacy rate and the gross enrolment \nratio.   \n13  The Law on State Registration of Entities provides, in Article 17(4), that information held in registers is available to \nthe public. Presently, requests for access to such information are processed manually.  \n14 For automating the SRA, any appropriate model being used in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) member countries will be chosen for replication. This decision would be based on a study of \nthe legal and business environment by experts. One such example is the Companies House in the United Kingdom \n(UK), a state-owned, public interest, nonprofit company performing the functions of the registrar of companies \nunder the UK Companies Act (2005). \n ", "4   \nneed for legislative and other changes to operationalize SRA\u2019s new business model. As part of \nthe reforms, the government also plans to introduce an electronic one-stop business support \nfacility. The TA will provide legal assistance to the Ministry of Justice to draft any required \nchanges  in  laws  and  rules  for  implementing  these  reforms.  The  TA  will  also  support  any \nreorganization of business processes of the SRA that may be necessary following setting up of \nan electronic business registry.15   \n \n9.  The TA will also fund procurement of equipment and software required for setting up the \nelectronic business registry. This would include networked computers with fault-tolerant server \nhardware (including backup servers aimed at ensuring adequate data safeguards and disaster \nrecovery procedures), broadband internet access, and facilities for scanning and converting \nexisting  paper  records  into  a  computer-readable  form.  Technical  requirements  and \nspecifications for the new information technology system will be drawn up by the consultant. \n \n10.  The successful implementation of this reform will be predicated on well-trained staff who \nare able to make effective use of the new technology and systems. A sizeable component in the \nTA will support training and skills upgrading of the SRA staff. The businesses and private sector \nentities, which are the potential clients of the new system, will be approached through a media \nand communication plan. Some consultative workshops will also be arranged with the private \nsector to create ownership for reform. The training and capacity building component would be a \nmajor  intervention  and  would  seek  to  develop  sustainable  capacity  in  the  system  through \ntraining of trainers. The possibility of housing future trainings in a state training center for \ncontinued access to trainings after TA closure will be explored with the government. \n \n11  The Government of Armenia will set up an information technology support unit in the \nSRA. It will support the transition during the TA and administer and manage the new system \nafter TA closure. Under the TA, the status of telecommunications and technology infrastructure \nwill be assessed to identify critical constraints that could jeopardize successful introduction of \nthe online platform for business registration.  \n \nC.  Other Donor Support \n12.  The government's efforts to improve the business environment and investment climate \nare being supported by the World Bank through a number of initiatives.16 Part of these initiatives \nis technical support planned to be provided to the SRA by the Doing Business Reform Unit of \nthe World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).17 Under the TA there would be \nclose liaison with the World Bank and IFC to ensure well-coordinated reform support. \n   \nD.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which (i) $500,000 equivalent will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB; and (ii) $75,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other Sources). The Government of Armenia will \n                                                 \n15 The SRA is not a large organization and staff numbers are not expected to be affected greatly by the proposed \nreform. \n16 The World Bank is developing the Public Financial Management and Corporate Audit and Accounts Framework \nthat  would  cover  internal  audit,  accounting  standards,  procurement  reforms,  monitoring  of  noncommercial \norganizations, pension reform, improved tax administration, etc. \n17 This is assistance of about $200,000 over a 2-year period and would mostly support the legal and regulatory side \nof the reforms required in the SRA. \n ", "  5\nprovide the balance of $25,000 equivalent in local currency cost through counterpart staff, office \nfacilities, and administrative support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The time frame for TA implementation is 24 months from January 2010 to December \n2011. \n \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Justice  will  be  the  executing  agency  while  the  SRA  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for the TA. A steering committee, chaired by the deputy minister of justice, \nwill be set up with representatives from appropriate public and private sector organizations \n(including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Central Bank of Armenia, and the \nprivate sector) and representatives of the SRA. The steering committee will meet quarterly or \nmore frequently, if required. Its terms of reference would include monitoring TA implementation \nand resolving any policy and implementation issues that may arise, reviewing consultants\u2019 \noutputs and reports, and giving guidance as required to ensure smooth implementation of the \nTA.   \n \n16.  The TA will require consultancy inputs for a total of 34 person-months (7 person-months \nof international consultant services and 27 person-months of national consultant services) on an \nintermittent basis over a period of 24 months. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality \nand cost-based selection method and based on a simplified technical proposal. Some individual \nconsultants would also be hired to fast track the implementation of the TA. The consulting firm \nand the individual consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3.  All equipment, software and services to be financed under the TA will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Procurement will be through the shopping method. Limited international bidding will be \nused for procurement of items that may not be available in Armenia and whose amounts are not \nlarge enough to attract foreign suppliers through international competitive bidding or if there are \nonly a limited number of suppliers. All items will be returned to the executing agency after \ncompletion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $75,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe  Government  of  Armenia  for  Institutional  Modernization  to  Improve  the  Business \nEnvironment, and hereby reports action to the Board.  \n \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved business  The number of days  SRA statistics    Government is committed to \nclimate   required to register a new    reform the legal and regulatory \nbusiness is reduced from  PPRMBD statistics  framework underlying the state \n18 as of 2008 to 7 by 2012    registration of legal entities  \n  World Bank\u2019s Doing   \n  Business Reportsa   Risk \n    A crisis, such as the recent \nGovernment poverty  financial crisis, may force the \nreduction strategy paper   government to defer the reforms \nin the areas of improving the \nbusiness climate and reducing \nthe costs of doing business \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEfficient electronic  SRA to respond to request  PPRMBD statistics  Government is committed to \nbusiness registration  of business information    reform \nsystem developed and  from the public decreased  SRA statistics     \npilot project implemented  from 5 days in 2008 to             Risk \n2 days in 2012   Feedback from chambers of  Procurement of computers and \n  commerce  other hardware is delayed \nTime taken to register a     \nbusiness by SRA reduced   \nfrom 7 days to 3 days by   \nJuly 2012   \n \n50% of businesses use the \nonline business registry by \nthe end of 2011 \n \nOutputs      Risks \n1.
