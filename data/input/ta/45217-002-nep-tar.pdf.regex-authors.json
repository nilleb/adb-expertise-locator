INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The country partnership strategy1 for Nepal, 2010\u20132012 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) seeks to promote stronger, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth to reduce the \nwidespread poverty and high inequality in the country\u2014the underlying causes of the decade-\nlong (1996\u20132006) civil conflict. Its strategic thrust is in line with the Government of Nepal\u2019s \nThree-Year Interim Plan (TYIP), fiscal year (FY) 2011\u2013FY2013, and remains valid in the current \ncontext as the country is still undergoing a post-conflict political transition. During the 2011 \ncountry  programming  mission,  the  government  requested  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing a strategic framework that would place Nepal on a high growth \npath. The TA will support the government in formulating a long-term economic development \nvision. After several rounds of consultations with the government agencies concerned\u2014e.g., the \nOffice of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, the National Planning Commission, and \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF)\u2014and ADB, the government prepared a concept paper (High \nLevel Economic Summit, Nepal) which the cabinet endorsed in September 2012. The TA\u2019s \nobjectives, scope, costs and financing plan, and implementation arrangements are based on \nconsultations with the government and its concept paper. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.2 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Nepal has been undergoing a challenging peace and political transition process since \n2006, when the decade-long civil conflict ended. The process is significantly advanced given the \nachievement  of important  milestones  such  as  the  decommissioning of  the  Maoists\u2019  former \ninsurgent army; and considerable progress has been made in resolving many  contentious \nissues while drafting a new constitution, such as those relating to governance, electoral system, \nand allocation of citizenship. However, the new constitution has not yet been finalized due to the \npersistent differences between the political parties on the federal structure. Consequently, the \nterm of the Constituent Assembly ended on 27 May 2012 without having promulgated the new \nconstitution. Major political parties are now exploring options for resuming the constitution-\ndrafting process, possibly through fresh Constituent Assembly elections in early 2013, and \nlegislating the new constitution shortly thereafter. \n \n3.  The long conflict and the protracted political transition have taken a toll on the country\u2019s \neconomy. Annual gross domestic product growth averaged 4.8% from 2008\u20132012, although the \neconomy  has  the  potential  to  grow  by  at  least  6%\u20137%  per  annum  given  its  comparative \nadvantages in hydropower, tourism, and certain industries and services.3 The conflict displaced \nmany people from rural areas, throttling agricultural growth and the rural economy. There has \nbeen substantial out-migration from the rural areas, reflecting the lack of jobs, leading to rising \npopulation pressure, and driving up land prices in urban areas. The out-migration has brought in \nincreased remittance income equivalent to 23% of gross domestic product and helped reduce \npoverty. However, it has led to increased consumption and imports while contributing little to \nproductive investments. Although certain sectors such as tourism and banking have expanded \nduring 2008\u20132012, overall economic growth largely depends on remittance inflows and has \nremained weak with low investments and little job creation. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Kathmandu \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 December 2012. \n3  For example, it has been estimated that getting four large hydropower projects into operation could boost the \nannual economic growth rate to 9%, and this is just a small fraction of the country\u2019s overall potential. Yet the \nprogress to tap the large potential is slow, as the sector faces multiple constraints in promoting private investments. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  Various diagnostic studies4 suggest that Nepal\u2019s growth and investments have been \nsubject to several binding constraints: (i) continuing political instability and its adverse impact on \nthe rule of law and the investment climate; (ii) inadequate infrastructure, particularly electricity, \nroads and irrigation, due to the low efficiency of public investments and limited private sector \ninvestment;  (iii)  poor  labor  relations  and  labor  market  rigidities;  (iv)  inefficient  state-owned \nenterprises eroding public resources and constraining private investment; (v) slow structural \ntransformation of the economy and weak business environment; and (vi) a vulnerable finance \nsector and weak domestic revenue base. \n \n5.  As the peace and political transition process nears its conclusion, the government has \ninitiated efforts to reinvigorate the economy by boosting public and private investments. The \nNepal Investment Board was established in November 2011 as a one-stop window for fostering \nprivate sector investments.5 Despite their differences on the political front with regard to the new \nconstitution, major political parties are also seeking to converge on the country\u2019s key economic \ndevelopment  agenda  under  a  \u201ccommon  minimum  economic  program\u201d,  facilitated  by  the \nbusiness  community.  The  emerging  consensus  includes  a  framework  of  reforms  aimed  at \nremoving  the  binding  constraints  and  achieving  double-digit  growth  within  a  decade,  and \ngraduating to a middle-income country within a generation. \n \n6.  With this development vision and reform agenda, the government is seeking to forge a \nbroad-based consensus across and within all political parties on the specific strategic directions \nand actions toward achieving the country\u2019s development objectives: higher economic growth \nand poverty reduction. There is general agreement on the need for accelerated growth and job \ncreation by removing the binding constraints. However, there are diverse views, especially at \nthe political level, on approaches to deal with these constraints, resulting in a slow economic \nreform process. Key areas where such differences prevail are: (i) the role of the private sector \ncompared  with  cooperatives  in  accelerating  growth;  (ii)  subsidies  for  public  enterprises, \nincluding petroleum products and electricity producers; (iii) hydropower development for export \nrather than domestic use; and (iv) promoting foreign direct investment. \n \n7.  For the country to move into a higher growth trajectory, forging a consensus on these \ncritical elements of economic development and reform will be essential. Therefore, there is a \nneed for a catalytic process and support to help the political parties and other stakeholders \nrefocus  their  attention  and  priorities  on  the  country\u2019s  needs.  Against  this  backdrop,  the \ngovernment has requested ADB to help, in coordination with the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom (DFID) and the World Bank, prepare for and organize a \nhigh-level  international  economic  summit  in  Kathmandu.  It  is  proposed  that  acclaimed \ninternational development economists and economic reform champions would be invited to \ninteract with Nepal\u2019s key political leaders, opinion makers, senior government officials, and other \nstakeholders, and advise on an economic reform and development course for achieving Nepal\u2019s \naspirations for higher economic growth and prosperity in the new era. It is envisaged that the \noutcome of the economic summit will serve as a foundation for Nepal\u2019s long-term economic \ndevelopment  vision  and  provide  a  framework  for  the  government\u2019s  new  medium-term \ndevelopment plan to succeed the current TYIP. \n \n                                                 \n4  One such study was the joint growth diagnostic analysis conducted by ADB, the International Labour Organization, \nthe Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the Government of Nepal in ADB. 2009. \n2008/09\u2014Nepal Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n5  The Nepal Investment Board started its operation by strengthening interministerial coordination and removing legal \nhurdles to improving the investment climate for large-scale infrastructure projects such as hydropower. \n ", "  3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  the  initiation  of  economic  reforms  and  development \nprograms  that  are  critical  to  the  government\u2019s  vision  of  achieving  double-digit  and  more \ninclusive economic growth by 2022. This will be measured by (i) demonstrated reforms in the \nareas  of  public\u2013private  partnership,  banking  and  finance,  labor  market,  and  foreign  direct \ninvestment; and (ii) institutional reforms of key public entities such as the Nepal Electricity \nAuthority, which are essential for improving the investment climate. \n \n9.  The intended outcome of the TA will be a broad-based national consensus on the \neconomic policies, reform agenda, strategic directions, actions, and key programs for achieving \nthe above vision. This will be measured by the declaration that is expected to be adopted at the \nend  of  an  international  economic  summit  (to  be  organized  in  Kathmandu  under  the  TA), \nencompassing these reform agendas, actions, and programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.   The TA will be implemented through desk reviews of relevant diagnostic studies on the \nNepalese  economy,  key  sector  assessments,  and  other  economic  policy  and  strategy \ndocuments.  Extensive  consultations  with  key  stakeholders\u2014government  agencies;  private \nsector,  academic,  and  civil  society  organizations;  and  development  partners\u2014will  be  held \nregionally and nationally to solicit views on strategic directions for Nepal\u2019s economic reforms \nand development in the current context. Building on this groundwork, the TA will organize a \nhigh-level  international  economic  summit  in  Kathmandu  to  forge  a  consensus  on  Nepal's \neconomic  reform  and  development  course.  The  summit  will  invite  acclaimed  international \ndevelopment economists and economic reform champions who will interact with Nepal\u2019s key \npolitical  leaders,  senior  government  officials,  local  experts,  and  other  stakeholders.  It  is \nenvisaged that the outcome of the economic summit will serve as a foundation for Nepal\u2019s long-\nterm economic development vision and for the government\u2019s new medium-term development \nplan to succeed the current TYIP. \n \n11.  The TA will deliver three outputs through the following methodology and activities: \n \n12.  Output 1: A comprehensive diagnostic synthesis report prepared on Nepal\u2019s key \ndevelopment  challenges  and  opportunities.  Building  on  the  various  existing  diagnostic \nstudies on economic growth, sector strategies, and other relevant areas, the TA will review and \nassess Nepal\u2019s development challenges and opportunities in the current context. Subject to \nprioritization based on further consultation with the government and other stakeholders during \nthe initial stages of TA implementation, the indicative sectors and themes to be studied are: \n(i) post-conflict  economic  transition;  (ii)  structural  transformation  of  the  economy; \n(iii) macroeconomic policies (subsidies, the Dutch disease effect [due to remittances]6, roles of \nthe  public and  private  sectors,  and  broad-based  inclusive  growth);  (iii)  investment  climate, \n                                                 \n6  Dutch disease is primarily associated with a natural resource discovery, but it can result from any large increase in \nforeign currency, including foreign direct investment, foreign aid, or a substantial increase in natural resource prices. \n \n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \nincluding access to finance and labor relations; (iv) infrastructure development (particularly \nenergy,  transport,  and  water  supply),  including  the  scope  for  public\u2013private  partnership; \n(vi) investments in tourism, and value addition and job creation in agri-business and industrial \nsectors;  and  (vii)  overall  investment  planning  and  resource  mobilization.  Based  on  the \nassessment,  the  TA  will  prepare  a  concise  and  coherent  diagnostic  synthesis  report, \nencompassing  economic  policies,  reform  agenda,  strategic  directions,  actions,  and  key \nprograms for the selected agenda items. The report will be presented and vetted in a series of \nregional and national stakeholder consultation workshops. \n \n13.  Output  2:  A  high-level  international  economic  summit  organized.  Based  on \noutput 1, a high-level international economic summit will be organized in Kathmandu, to which \ninternationally renowned development economists and reform leaders, including those from \nmore advanced Asian countries, will be invited as eminent resource persons. The background \ndiagnostic report will be shared with them in advance for prior review and advice. The summit \nwill provide a platform for Nepal\u2019s key policy, decision, and opinion makers to interact with these \neminent economists on economic reform and gain insight in development lessons of other \ncountries in similar situations, and how Nepal can strategize and achieve high and inclusive \neconomic  growth  with  widespread  employment  generation.  A  summit  declaration  will  be \nprepared and adopted at the end of the summit as its main output. \n \n14.  Output 3: A framework for Nepal\u2019s long-term development vision and a medium-\nterm development plan prepared. Based on outputs 1 and 2, detailed proceedings of the \nsummit  will  be  prepared  under  the  TA.  The  proceedings  will  serve  as  a  comprehensive \nframework to support the government in preparing its long-term economic development vision \n(Nepal Vision 2030) and a new medium-term development plan to succeeed the current TYIP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $790,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The main elements to be funded \nby ADB are the services of international and national consultants, equipment, and workshops \nand  seminars.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office \naccommodation, counterpart staff, facilities for seminars and meetings, other administrative \nsupport, and other in-kind contributions. DFID and the World Bank are expected to provide \nparallel cofinancing to cover the other additional expenses relating to the economic summit and \npreparatory works. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  Institutional  arrangements.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA.  The \ngovernment  has  already  approved  a  two-tier  institutional  structure  to  manage  the \nimplementation of the TA, coordinate TA activities, and monitor the implementation progress, \nincluding the economic summit. A steering committee\u2014chaired by the minister for finance, \ncochaired by the National Planning Commission vice-chairman, and comprising representatives \nof major political parties, independent economists, the governor of Nepal Rastra Bank, and \nrelevant senior government officials\u2014will provide overall policy-level guidance to a summit \norganizing committee (SOC) on the preparation and organization of the summit. The steering \ncommittee  will  also  provide  necessary  coordination  and  support  for  active  participation  of \npolitical and other opinion leaders in the process toward forging overall consensus during the \neconomic summit. \n \n ", "  5 \n \n17.  The SOC, to be chaired by the finance secretary and comprising secretaries of various \nministries,  will  provide  overall  technical  and  management  support  and  guidance  to  the \nimplementation of the TA and organization of the summit. Selected eminent persons including \nprivate sector representatives will be invited as needed, along with representatives of the three \ndevelopment partners\u2014i.e., ADB as the main coordinator, DFID, and the World Bank. The SOC \nwill be assisted by a secretariat comprising a team of TA consultants and administrative staff. \n \n18.  Consulting  services. The TA will require 20 person-months of consulting services \n(9 person-months  international  and  11  person-months  national).  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  through  a  reputable  organization  (consultant  firm)  that  is  highly  professional  and \nexperienced in preparing and organizing similar high-level international economic forums. Within \nthis framework, the selected organization will also undertake specialized studies on the sectors \nand themes selected for the summit through the engagement of local experts, from which \nadditional 12 person-months of inputs will be required. Based on the selected sectors and \nthemes to be finalized in consultation with the government and other stakeholders (from among \nthe tentative list in para. 12), these additional experts will be selected by the consultant firm in \nconsultation with ADB from among the best-qualified and available local experts. In addition, the \nconsultant firm will further engage an event management agent to manage the logistics for the \nsummit. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.   In view of (i) the need to engage a highly reputed organization that can manage the \nsummit with high-level international experts (a critical component of the TA), and (ii) urgency to \norganizing  the  summit  by  September  2013  and  to  reflect  the  outputs  in  the  medium-term \ndevelopment plan of the government within 2013, the TA will recruit the consultant firm through \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method with simplified technical proposals. ADB will adopt \nfast-track measures, including advance actions. The consultants will be selected in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Office \nequipment required for the implementation of the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the \ngovernment upon completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistant Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, from 1 February 2013 to 30 April 2014. The \nsteering committee will meet for the inception of the TA, and at least every 2 months thereafter \nto review the implementation progress and resolve any related issues. It will provide policy \nguidance to the SOC for effective day-to-day implementation of the TA and for organizing the \nsummit. The steering committee and the SOC may invite representatives of the private sector, \ncivil society, and other stakeholders to their meetings. ADB will field frequent missions to review \nimplementation progress, and to guide the TA consultants (in consultation with MOF). These \nmissions will make appropriate recommendations to MOF and ADB management should the \nimplementation environment change drastically, affecting the achievement of the TA objectives. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Support for Formulating an Economic Development Vision, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks \nImpact    For all indicators:   Assumption \n       \nEconomic reform and  By 2017, passage of at  Nepal Gazette, Ministry of  Necessary institutional capacity \ndevelopment programs  least 3 key legislations\u2014 Finance\u2019s annual budget  and resources will be available \ninitiated toward  in the areas of public\u2013 statements, midterm  to undertake these reform and \nachieving the  private partnership, labor  budget reviews,  development programs \ngovernment\u2019s vision of  market, and foreign  economic survey, and  effectively. \nachieving double-digit  direct investment\u2014for  policy papers issued by   \n \nand more inclusive  improving the overall  various line ministries \n \neconomic growth by  investment climate \nRisk \n2022   \nBy 2018, introduction of   \nEstablishment of overall political \ninstitutional and policy \nstability and certainty\u2014essential \nreforms at key public \nfor effective implementation of \nentities such as Nepal \nthe economic reform and \nElectricity Authority that \ndevelopment programs\u2014is \nare critical for improving \nslow. \nthe investment climate \n \nBaseline: Existing \nlegislations, policies, and \ninstitutions are deficient \nand need revisions to \nmake them more \ninvestment friendly \nOutcome      Assumptions \n \n     \nBroad-based national  A joint declaration by  Minutes and proceedings  Major political parties and other \nconsensus on economic  political party leaders  of the proposed  stakeholders do not disagree \npolicies, reform agenda,  and other key  international economic  on the need to advance the \nstrategic directions and  stakeholders during the  summit to be supported  country\u2019s economic reform and \nactions, and key  proposed international  by the TA  development agenda, and will \nprograms for achieving  economic summit in  remain committed to the \nthe vision of double-digit  September 2013 on a  expected resolution at the \nand more inclusive  framework for the  economic summit on Nepal\u2019s \neconomic growth by  economic reform agenda future. \n2022     \nBaseline: Current  Other key stakeholders will \nsituation is marked by  productively participate in the \ndivergent views,  TA activities. \nespecially at the political \nlevel, on approaches to \nNepal\u2019s key economic \nreform and development \nagenda \nOutputs      Assumptions \n   \n   \n1.
