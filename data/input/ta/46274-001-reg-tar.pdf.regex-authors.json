INTRODUCTION \n1.  Improved transport links cut the cost of doing business, create good conditions for larger \ntrade  flows,  bring  people  closer  to  markets  and  social  services,  and  ultimately  accelerate \neconomic growth. This was underscored in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Transport and Trade Facilitation (TTF) strategy endorsed by the CAREC member \ncountries at the sixth ministerial conference in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in 2007. 1 The TTF strategy \naims to (i) establish competitive transport corridors across the CAREC region; 2 (ii) facilitate \nefficient movement through corridors and across borders; and (iii) develop sustainable, safe, \nand  user-friendly  transport  and  trade  networks.  In  addition  to  building  physical  transport \ninfrastructure,  the  TTF  strategy  emphasizes  the  so-called  soft  areas  of  harmonizing  and \nsimplifying cross-border transport and trade procedures, documentation, and regulations among \nthe countries, to create a level playing field for economic operators and to promote efficiency \nand better services. CAREC national focal points have stressed the urgency of acting in the soft \nareas of the TTF strategy. \n \n2.  A seminar on corridor-based transport facilitation arrangements in the CAREC region in \nJuly 2012 identified key constraints on cross-border transport in the region, described existing \ntransport  facilitation  arrangements,  and  recommended  future  action.  Through  technical \nassistance (TA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), as CAREC program secretariat, will be \nable to support cross-border transport facilitation in the CAREC region. 3  It will build on earlier \nloans,  grants,  and  TA  that  supported  TTF  under  the  CAREC  program.4 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The CAREC TTF strategy pursues more efficient movement across borders by removing \nnonphysical barriers, which are legal, regulatory, administrative, documentary, organizational, \nand similar hindrances that adversely affect the efficiency, speed, and cost of cross-border \ntransport. These barriers needlessly increase transport costs and, consequently, the prices of \nraw materials and commodities. In extreme cases, these barriers completely prohibit the cross-\n                                                \n1  Founded in 2001, CAREC is a partnership of 10 countries\u2014Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of \nChina, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan\u2014and six \nmultilateral institutions: the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nInternational Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, United Nations Development Programme, and World \nBank. ADB has served as the CAREC secretariat since 2001. \n2  The six CAREC corridors are (i) Europe\u2013East Asia, (ii) Mediterranean\u2013East Asia, (iii) Russian Federation\u2013Middle \nEast\u2013South Asia, (iv) Russian Federation\u2013East Asia, (v) East Asia\u2013Middle East and South Asia, and (vi) Europe\u2013\nMiddle East and South Asia.  \n3  ADB\u2019s vice-president for Operations 1 provided concept clearance for the TA on 28 June 2012.

The new 10-year strategic framework for \nCAREC (CAREC 2020), which was endorsed by the member countries in November 2011, \nemphasizes the importance of TTF to achieving the strategic objectives of expanded trade and \nimproved competitiveness.5 \n \n4.  An assessment of transport and trade indicators along CAREC corridors was conducted \nfrom January to December 2011 as part of CAREC corridor performance measurement and \nmonitoring (CPMM). 6 CPMM revealed that the average time required to clear a border crossing \npoint was 7.9 hours;7 the average cost at a border crossing point was $156; the average speed \nfor a 20-ton truck or 20-foot-equivalent-unit container to travel 500 kilometers along a CAREC \ncorridor section was 38 kilometers per hour without delay and 22 kilometers per hour with delay; \nand  the  average  cost  to  travel  along  a  corridor  section  was  $959.  Although  there  were \nimprovements in the values of some CPMM indicators in 2011 over 2010, many bottlenecks and \nimpediments to the smooth flow of goods, vehicles, and people were observed along each of \nthe six CAREC corridors. \n \n5.  There  are  many  cross-border  transport  facilitation  agreements  involving  CAREC \nmember countries designed to mitigate nonphysical barriers to the smooth movement of goods \nand  people  between  and  among  them.  These  include  international  transport  facilitation \nconventions to which many CAREC countries are contracting parties; plurilateral agreements \nsuch  as  those  under  the  Transport  Corridor  Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia  Program,  Economic \nCooperation  Organization,  and  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organization;  and  bilateral  transport \nagreements such as the Agreement on the Cross-Border Transport of Persons, Vehicles, and \nGoods within the Framework of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, between the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.8 Progress in finalizing and implementing these arrangements \nhas been varied and generally slow, barely addressing the key constraints on cross-border \ntransport in the CAREC region: (i) restrictions on the entry of motor vehicles, often causing \ncostly and time-consuming transshipment; (ii) different standards pertaining to vehicle size, \nweight, and safety requirements, as well as driver qualifications; (iii) inconsistent and difficult \nformalities related to customs procedures, inspections, clearances, and assessment of duties; \nand (iv) restrictive visa requirements. \n \n6.  As part of CAREC 2020\u2019s action plan for 2011\u20132015, it is envisaged that transport \nfacilitation agreements will be reviewed, formulated, and implemented on a pilot basis along \nselected CAREC corridors and their border crossing points. Pilots will be selected according to \nthe interest and willingness of countries to participate, the volume of international trade passing \nthrough  the  corridor,  and  the  readiness  of  transport  and  border  infrastructure  to  handle \nincreased cross-border traffic.  \n \n7.  At their meeting in Beijing in September 2011, CAREC national focal points discussed \nproposals to pursue cross-border transport facilitation in the region in line with CAREC 2020. \nParticipants concurred on the need to remove nonphysical barriers to interstate and transit trade. \nThey agreed that, as a first step, ADB will organize information-sharing workshops and country \nconsultations on ongoing and planned transport facilitation arrangements in CAREC countries, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2011.

The protocol is being considered by the Kyrgyz Republic. ", "  3 \nwith a view to formulating recommendations on feasible approaches for addressing nonphysical \nbarriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people along CAREC corridors. These \napproaches could include (i) amending existing agreements to make them operational, (ii) \nimplementing critical provisions of existing agreements to carry out key facilitation measures, \nand (iii) formulating and implementing simple corridor-based transport facilitation agreements.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The  TA  will  help  facilitate  the  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and  people  in  the \nCAREC region, which is in line with the CAREC TTF strategy and the operational priorities of \nTTF under CAREC 2020. It will complement ongoing and completed physical investments made \nin CAREC corridors. The TA, which is the first phase of a planned series of TA projects to help \npromote cross-border transport in the CAREC region, will complement related trade facilitation \nmeasures supported by ADB. It will help (i) identify key nonphysical barriers along priority \nCAREC corridors, (ii) formulate feasible approaches for addressing them, and (iii) prepare for \nadopting these agreed approaches. Subsequent phases will build on the results of the first \nphase and, subject to the satisfactory implementation of the first phase, support other activities \nin  line  with  the  agreed  approaches  and  provide  similar  support  for  other  priority  CAREC \ncorridors. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  enhanced  cross-border  transport  along  CAREC  corridors.  The \noutcome will be the commencement of transport facilitation arrangements in the CAREC region. \nThe TA  will  put  into  action  priority  cross-border transport facilitation measures  in  selected \nCAREC corridors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will help deliver the following outputs: (i) CAREC countries agree on feasible \napproaches to mitigate nonphysical barriers to cross-border transport along CAREC corridors; \nand (ii) based on the first output, the required transport facilitation arrangements are identified \nand prepared for implementation.  \n \n11.  Agreement on feasible approaches to cross-border transport. The TA will support \nthe  conduct  of  knowledge  events  on  international  good  practice  on  cross-border  transport \nfacilitation and its benefits, for the participation of key stakeholders in CAREC countries. Based \non feedback received from these knowledge events, detailed consultations and related studies \nwill  then  be  undertaken  with  selected  CAREC  countries  on  possible  transport  facilitation \narrangements that may be pursued for the CAREC corridors that traverse them. These studies \nwill  (i)  assess  the  nonphysical  barriers  to  cross-border  transport  and  benefits  derived  by \naddressing them;  (ii)  develop  a  sound  business  case for  cross-border transport facilitation \ninitiatives  through  the  CAREC  platform,  taking  into  account  the  expected  results  from  the \nplanned midterm review of the CAREC TTF strategy,9 and (iii) formulate feasible approaches to \nfacilitating cross-border transport in selected corridors. Subregional meetings will be organized \nto discuss the outcomes of the consultation and studies with a view to reaching agreement on \nfeasible approaches to facilitating cross-border transport along selected CAREC corridors. \n \n                                                \n9  To be undertaken under the auspices of planned ADB TA for approval in 2012. \n ", "4   \n12.  Identification and preparation of transport facilitation arrangements. Based on the \nagreements reached on feasible approaches to cross-border transport, the TA will help (i) \nidentify the transport facilitation arrangements to be pursued for selected corridors and (ii) \ndetermine the required assistance to formulate and prepare for implementation the agreed \ntransport facilitation arrangements. The TA will support the latter by providing (i) assistance in \nestablishing new national TTF committees, or operationalizing existing ones, in participating \ncountries,  which  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  agreed  transport  facilitation \narrangements; (ii) technical, legal, and/or coordinating support to the committees; (iii) advisory \nsupport to participating governments toward drafting amended or new laws and regulations \nnecessary  to  implement  transport  facilitation  arrangements;  (iv)  assistance  in  formulating \noperations  manuals  and  related  training  for  officials  concerned;  and/or  (v)  outreach  and \nawareness raising targeting key stakeholders. \n \n13.  Attaining the expected TA impact assumes that ongoing and planned complementary \ntrade facilitation measures will achieve their desired results. Another assumption is that border \ncrossing points along CAREC corridors will be upgraded or modernized. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV). The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million equivalent (cost estimates are in Appendix \n2).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be administered by the Central \nand West Asia Department (CWRD). Any existing national joint TTF committees, including \nnational joint committees already established in the context of the CAREC TTF strategy, will be \nTA  implementing  agencies.10 A  team  comprising  two  international  staff  members  and  one \nanalyst from CWRD will oversee the implementation of the TA, which will be closely coordinated \nwith the ADB East Asia Department. The TA will be implemented from September 2012 to \nDecember 2015. \n \n16.  Implementing the TA will require about 20 person-months of international consultancy \nfrom one TTF specialist (18 person-months) and short-term experts and resource persons (2 \nperson-months combined) and about 106 person-months of national consultancy from three \nlegal  specialists  (18  person-months  combined),  four  TTF  specialists  (48  person-months \ncombined), and one CAREC transport facilitation analyst (40 person-months). The consultants\u2019 \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. These consultants will report to two international \nstaff  members  in  CWRD,  who  will  act  as  team  leaders  and  supervise  consultants\u2019  work. \nConsultants will be engaged as individuals because (i) the tasks to be undertaken and the \ncountries of origin of the consultants are diverse, (ii) CAREC national focal points are expected \nto be actively involved in implementing the TA and coordinating with CAREC as a whole, and (iii) \nCWRD staff will actively manage TA implementation. The consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Some office and telecommunication equipment may be procured by ADB in coordination \n                                                \n10 For example, the Kyrgyz Republic established a national joint committee on 29 January 2008 under the leadership \nof the minister of economic regulation (pursuant to Regulation on National Joint Council of Kyrgyz Republic on \nTransport and Trade Facilitation No. 29), and Tajikistan established a national joint committee on 2 October 2010 \nunder the leadership of the first deputy prime minister (pursuant to Resolution of the Government of the Republic of \nTajikistan No. 104). ", "  5 \nwith the Office of Administrative Services and Office of Information Systems and Technology. \nEquipment will be procured pursuant to ADB Project Administration Instruction 5.09, section L \non Purchasing Equipment and Vehicles. This equipment will be turned over to implementing \nagencies upon TA completion. \n \n17.  Workshops, trainings, or seminars will be held during implementation. All procurement of \ngoods and other services under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with the ADB Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n18.  Reports on TA outputs will be submitted to the CAREC senior officials\u2019 meetings and \nannual CAREC ministerial conferences, as well as posted on the CAREC program website \n(www.carecprogram.org).  The  TA  outcome  will  be  measured  by  resource  allocations  from \nparticipating governments to the implementation of transport facilitation arrangements and will \nbe  reported  to  the  CAREC  ministerial  conference  and  disseminated  through  the  CAREC \nwebsite. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Facilitating Cross-Border Transport in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nRegion (Phase 1), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced cross- By 2018, relative to  CAREC corridors  Ongoing and planned \nborder transport  2011, the corridor time- performance  complementary trade \nalong CAREC  cost distance  measurement and  facilitation measures \ncorridors  methodology indicators  monitoring studies and  achieve their desired \nfor time will be reduced  World Bank Logistics  results. \nby at least 50%, and for  Performance Index   \ncost by at least 30%,  Border crossing points \nalong the CAREC  along CAREC corridors are \ncorridor(s) where agreed  upgraded and modernized. \ntransport facilitation   \nmeasures will apply. \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImplementation of  By 2016, participating  Report of CAREC senior  CAREC corridors where \ntransport facilitation  governments put in  officials to the 15th  transport facilitation \narrangement(s)  place or operationalize  CAREC ministerial  arrangements will be \ncommenced  national bodies to  conference  implemented are in good \noversee the  condition. \nimplementation of the   \nagreed transport  Risk \nfacilitation  Influential groups with \narrangement(s).   vested interests in the \n    status quo lobby against \ncross-border transport \n   \nfacilitation. \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n1.
