The \nProject will also reassign and consolidate responsibility for the \noverall government accounting function and for check issuance \nwith the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). \n   \nRationale  Strengthening  of  the  PAS  will  enhance  good  governance  by \nimproving efficiency, enhancing accountability and transparency, \nand contributing to more effective public sector management, as \nwell  as  to  the  development  of  effective  fiscal  operations  and \nmacroeconomic  policy.  The  quality  of  governance  in  public \nfinance  management  is  critical  for  ensuring  expenditures  for \nprograms targeting, reducing poverty, preventing corruption and \nfraud and reducing the vulnerability of the Maldives to external \nshocks. \n   \nObjectives   The objectives are to (i) promote improved budget practices, thus \nenhancing financial management as well as the development of \neffective  fiscal  operations  and  macroeconomic  policymaking; \n(ii) establish accurate, reliable, and timely financial reporting to \nmeet international accounting standards by eliminating laborious \nmanual financial reporting systems, promoting accountability, and \nproviding appropriate financial information to the Government for \neconomic decision making; and (iii) conduct more comprehensive \nand updated control over public funds, and help develop a cash \nmanagement  strategy  to  rationalize  cash  movements  and \nholdings, especially for the atolls and islands. \n \nThe Project components include (i) restructuring the organization \nof ministries and departments (by establishing finance sections in \nministries,  assigning  accounting  and  internal  audit  function  to \nMOFT,  and  establishing  accounting  units  in  the  atolls  and \nislands);  (ii)  strengthening  the  PAS  by  introducing  core \ngovernment funds; chart of accounts; a ledger structure; and a \nvoucher system for ministries, atolls, and islands; and preparing \nannual financial statements; (iii) streamlining the function of the \nMaldives Monetary Authority (MMA) for the PAS by reassigning \nthe banking function to MMA, and establishing one public account; \nand (iv) supporting human resource development and training.  \n \n   ", "  iii\nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $6.265  million \nequivalent, of which $4.576 million (73%) is the foreign exchange \ncost and $1.689 million equivalent (27%) is the local currency \ncost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of SDR \n3,781,000 ($5 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources \nto finance 80% of the total project cost. The Government will \nfinance the costs of $1.265 million equivalent, comprising 20% of \ntotal project cost. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB loan of SDR 3,781,000 will have a repayment \nperiod of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Borrower  will  make  the  loan  available  to  MOFT  through \nTerms  appropriate budgetary allocations. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2006 (6 months after the completion date)  \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2005  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency and  MOFT  will  have  overall  operational  responsibility  for  project \nImplementation  management. The project steering committee (PSC), chaired by \nArrangements  the Minister of State for Finance and Treasury or the Minister\u2019s \nappointee, will be established prior to the commencement of the \nProject. A project management unit will be established in MOFT \nwith day-to-day operational responsibility for project management. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Procurement for computer software \nand hardware will be carried out using international competitive \nbidding procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for (i) implementation of a \ncomputerized  PAS  at  MOFT,  MMA,  ministries,  and  atolls; \n(ii) human  resource  development  and  training;  (iii)  support  for \ntender selection of accounting software and hardware vendors; \n(iv) data and system support and security for computerization; and \n(v) support to the treasury division and Internal Audit Bureau of \nMOFT.  About  91 person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 75 persons-months of domestic consulting services \nwill be required. Consultants to be engaged under the Project will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  quality-based  selection \nmethod will be utilized for consultant selection. ADB Management \napproved advance action for recruitment of consulting services.  \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  Introducing the new PAS will entail the following main benefits: \nBeneficiaries   (i) improving the quality, timeliness, and integrity of the accounting \nsystem will enhance transparency and accountability, and thus \nstrengthen governance; (ii) reliable and timely information on the \nfinancial position of the Government will enable the Government \nto  conduct  more  competent  fiscal  policy  and  macroeconomic \nmanagement to reduce the vulnerability to external shocks due to \nthe high dependency of the Maldivian economy on imports and \nlimited  income  derived  from  tourism  and  fishing;  (iii) reliable \ninformation on the fiscal status of the country will enhance lenders \nand investor confidence in the country; (iv) external reports will be \nprepared to meet internationally accepted accounting standards to \nenable better assessment by international rating agencies; and \n(v) significant reductions in idle cash holdings of ministries and \natolls will lead to better financial returns on public funds through \nimprovements in fiscal discipline and cash management. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks are (i) delay in enactment of the public finance act, \namendments to Audit Act, and the public enterprises act; and in \nissuing  the  relevant  public  finance  instructions;  (ii) delayed \ndecision  making  by  the  PSC  on  implementation  plans;  and \n(iii) delay in human resource development and training for primary \nand supporting staff. To mitigate these risks: (i) the Government \nhas provided assurance that MOFT will have submitted the draft \npublic finance act, public enterprises act and the amendments to \nthe Audit Act (collectively referred to as the draft laws) to the Law \nCommission, and the Law Commission will have submitted the \ndraft laws (as finalized by the Law Commission) to the People\u2019s \nMajlis before loan effectiveness; (ii) the project management unit \nwill prepare necessary draft plans and documentation to assist the \nPSC make timely decisions; and (iii) the Project, with consulting \nsupport, will prepare the human resource development strategy \nand conduct training needs assessment and the training program. \n   \n \n ", "  v\n ", "I.   THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the Public Accounting System Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  High dependence of the Maldivian economy on imports, and limited income derived from \ntourism and fishing exacerbates its vulnerability to external shocks. The effects of external \nshocks are quickly transmitted to the poor.  Hence, despite the significant economic and social \nprogress  achieved,  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  still  substantial,  particularly  in  the  highly \ndispersed, small, and sparsely populated islands. This poses major structural challenges for the \ncountry as articulated in the Government\u2019s Sixth National Development Plan (2001\u20132005). The \nGovernment's public expenditures account for more than 40% of the gross domestic product. \nThus, public sector intervention is a powerful tool for economic and social development. \n \n3.  The Government's growth and poverty reduction strategy focuses on strengthening the \nmacroeconomic  framework  and  good  governance  in  the  public  sector,  supporting  human \ndevelopment,  and  improving  the  policy  environment  for  the  public  and  private  sectors. \nEstablishing  a  modern  public  administration  system,  governed  by  a  comprehensive  and \ntransparent  set  of  laws,  and  an  impartial  and  competent  judiciary  is  prioritized  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s development agenda, while efficient control and utilization of public money is \nunderscored as a means to attaining the maximum benefits from the development program. \n4.  The  operational  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Maldives \nsupports poverty reduction through a combination of pro-poor growth, social development, and \ngood  governance  initiatives.  For  pro-poor  growth,  ADB\u2019s  assistance  is  fostering  regional \ndevelopment.  To  raise  the  level  of  social  development,  ADB\u2019s  focus  is  on  assisting \npostsecondary education and skills development. To support good governance, ADB is focusing \non developing improved information access and public sector connectivity, and improving the \neffectiveness of public sector management. Introduction of a new public accounting system \n(PAS) will enhance good governance by improving efficiency and control of public money, \nenhancing accountability and transparency, and contributing more effectively to public sector \nmanagement as well as the development of effective fiscal operations and macroeconomic \npolicy.  Once  funds  that  are  dispersed  throughout  the  system  are  clearly  identified  and \nconsolidated,  they  could  then  be  utilized  for  programs  targeting  poverty  reduction  and \npreventing  corruption  and  fraud,1 which  mostly  affect  the  poor.  Moreover,  the  quality  of \ngovernance  in  public  finance  management  is  critical  in  reducing  the  vulnerabilities  of  the \nMaldives to external shocks. \n      \n5.  Since 1994, the Government has been collaborating with aid agencies to develop a \nmore  efficient  public  finance  system.  More  recently,  the  public  expenditure  and  public \naccounting systems were enunciated as issues for immediate attention in the Sixth National \nDevelopment Plan. Under a World Bank initiative, ADB and the International Monetary Fund \n                                                 \n1  The  proposed  PAS  is  designed  to  strengthen  control  over  public  funds,  and  enhance  accountability  and \ntransparency in public finances, which will improve financial management and prevent corruption and fraud. A \nsingle public account and check issuance unit will tighten control over spending beyond budget appropriation. The \nInternal Audit Bureau, being established under the Project, will monitor legitimacy of public financial operations, \nand timely and accurately prepared and audited financial statements will allow review and assessment of the \nproper usage of public funds. ", "2     \n(IMF) are preparing the first public expenditure review for the Maldives. The objectives of the \nreview are to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government\u2019s spending program \nand its institutional aspects, particularly in light of poverty reduction, and to recommend a reform \nagenda for improving public sector spending. Preliminary findings of the review underscore the \nneed for a new PAS, as proposed by this Project. \n \n6.  The public accounting and auditing system needs to be streamlined to enable public \nmoney to be managed in an efficient and accountable manner. ADB has been working with the \nGovernment for the past 5 years as its lead partner in achieving this goal. ADB provided \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 to the Government from August 1997 to December 1998 to conduct \nan assessment of the existing PAS and to identify its major limitations, inadequacies, and \nweaknesses. This was followed by TA3 to identify the legal, institutional, and human resource \nrequirements for introducing a new PAS.  \n \n7.  In April 2001, after reviewing the findings and recommendations of these studies, the \nGovernment decided to adopt the design and the supporting reform strategies for introducing \nthe new PAS.4  During the Country Strategy and Program Mission in May 2001, the Government \nasked ADB to provide a project preparatory TA5 for the proposed Project. The TA vetted the \ndetails of how a new PAS could interface with and update the existing accounting system with \nas little disruption to the economy as possible, through a critical review of proposed PAS \nmodels, system requirements, and capabilities in the Maldives. The findings of the TA team \nwere then discussed in detail with the Technical Advisory Team and the Ministerial Level \nAdvisory Group. The feedback received was included in the final TA report. Building on the TA \nrecommendations and findings, a fact-finding mission6 was undertaken from 7 to 18 April 2002 \nfor the Project. This report is based on the understandings reached with the Government during \nfact-finding. The project framework is detailed in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n8.  The  current  PAS  is  rudimentary  and  does  not  achieve  the  overall  objectives  and \nconsistent performance criteria required for PAS. These objectives and criteria include provision \nof accurate and adequate information in a timely manner on the financial position, budgetary \ncommitments and operation results of the funds (surplus or deficit positions) monitored by the \naccounting groups of ministries and atolls,7 in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples; compliance with finance-related constitutional, statutory, and legal requirements and \ncontractual provisions of the country; and streamlined financial reporting to enable budgetary \nand accounting functions to be complementary and to effectively integrate elements of financial \nmanagement and audits. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997.

Hideaki Imamura, Programs Officer assisted the \nmission in the field. \n7  \u201cAtoll\u201d refers to a group of islands consisting of a coral reef surrounding a lagoon. The Maldives has 26 atolls, but \nfor administrative purposes, 20 atolls and Male\u2019 make up the 21 administrative units of the Republic of the \nMaldives. \n ", "     3\nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Capacity Constraints \n \n9.  Public sector staff involved with the accounting function work at a relatively rudimentary \nlevel in line with the requirements of a manual, line-budget oriented accounting system. To \nensure adequate implementation of the new PAS, the skills mix will have to be substantially \nupgraded  not  only  to  implement  the  new  accounting  practices,  but  also  for  financial \nmanagement, preparation and analyses of financial statements, and their use as inputs into \nmacroeconomic policymaking. Other external funding agencies have not assisted in this area as \nthe absorptive capacity of the Government is limited. While the Project will provide focused \ncapacity building in phases to the relevant staff vis-\u00e0-vis workshops and on-the-job training, the \npace of the process will largely be determined by the existing and absorptive capacity of the \nstaff being trained. \n \n10.  A new PAS would not have been effective without the necessary legal foundation. \nHence, under the capacity-building TA (footnote 3), three key bills for the public finance act, the \namendments of the Audit Act, and the public enterprise act were drafted and are being reviewed \nby the Maldivian legislative authorities for adoption. The bills aim to define the legal framework \nwithin which the transparent and efficient implementation of the new PAS can be enforced, \nultimately ascertaining an alignment of the newly introduced rules with practices. Many of the \nconcepts, some of the terminology included in the bills are novel. Hence, a training workshop on \nthese new bills, in conjunction with the Public Service Division of the President's Office, as part \nof  the  Seminar  on  Financial  Management,  was  held  in  June  2002,  for  a  group  of  senior \ngovernment officials and financial managers of public sector organizations.  \n \n2.  Scope for Improvement of the Existing Public Accounting System   \n \n11.  The existing PAS, which was introduced more than three decades ago, is subject to a \nnumber of constraints. The financial legislative framework is not comprehensive. Currently, the \ncountry has an outline legal framework for regulating control of public finances including the \nPAS. The framework components are the Constitution of the Republic of the Maldives 1997,8 \nand in operational terms, the Financial Regulations.9 Under the current PAS, no annual financial \nstatements  regarding  the  Government\u2019s  financial  position  and  status  are  reported  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Majlis,10 and no audited financial statements are prepared. The annual accounts and \ninformation  on  Government  finances  are  presently  included  in  budget  papers11 and  the \nGovernment Budget in Statistics Handbook.12 In fact, no policies identify the ownership and \nresponsibility for the accounting function, and provide for a data entry system. Only a limited \n                                                 \n8 The Constitution provides in Chapter X\u2013The Auditing and Maintenance of Accounts of the State, for certain \naccounting functions to be performed by the auditor general. However, under Article 127 of the Constitution, the \nauditor general is obliged to act on the advice of the President in this regard.  Accordingly, ultimate power and \nauthority for determining the manner and form of the PAS rests, under the Constitution, with the President. \n9  These are implicitly authorized by Article 127 of the Constitution. These regulations were last revised in 1992, and \nare modified by President\u2019s circulars. However these regulations are not explicitly authorized or recognized under \nany specific legislation.    \n10  People's Majlis is the National Assembly of the Maldives.  \n11  Budget papers are usually prepared in December each year for submission to the People\u2019s Majlis by the Ministry of \nFinance and Treasury (MOFT) and comprise the past year\u2019s performance and current year\u2019s status and proposed \nfuture budget proposals.  \n12  The Government Budget in Statistics Handbook is normally issued in the first quarter of each year, reflecting the \ncontents of the budget paper and the analysis of budget expenditure and revenue. \n ", "4     \naccounting reporting structure exists. Only the Treasury General Account is used for public \nmoney  recording  purposes;  however,  the  account  does  not  reflect  all  transactions  being \nmonitored by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). And the current PAS used in the \natolls is highly inefficient, leading to excessive holdings and movements of cash.13 \n \n3.  Life of the Project  \n \n12.  The Project is to be implemented over 3 years. While this may appear to be a relatively \ntight schedule, the pace of implementation is important. The Maldivian economy urgently needs \na new PAS. Support for the Project is strong throughout the Government, and the momentum \nmust  not  be  lost  during  implementation.  The  dependence  on  information  technology  and \ncomputers, while facilitating a less labor-intensive and more user-friendly introduction to the \nsystem, necessitates a reasonable pace of transition from the existing to the new PAS. The \nspecialized accounting software and hardware to be used must still be at par with the rest of the \nworld by the time the new PAS is operational. Designed carefully over the last 2 years in close \nconsultation with the Government, the current timetable is realistically achievable from both \ntechnical and absorptive capacity perspectives at this time. However, the Project will be closely \nmonitored by ADB and the Government; three monitoring missions and two comprehensive \nreviews  of  the  Project  are  scheduled.  If  during  implementation,  a  longer  implementation \nschedule appears to be needed, then both ADB and the Government will explore the availability \nof additional funding or TA from ADB and other donors. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \nA.  Objectives \n13.  The ultimate goal of the Project is to improve the quality of governance by introducing a \nnew PAS with institutional reorganization and capacity building aiming to enhance efficiency, \naccountability,  and  transparency;  and  contributing  more  effectively  to  public  sector \nmanagement; as well as the development of effective fiscal operations and macroeconomic \npolicy.  \n \n14.  The objectives are to (i) promote improved budget practices, thus enhancing financial \nmanagement as well as the development of effective fiscal operations and macroeconomic \npolicymaking; (ii) establish accurate, reliable, and timely financial reporting to meet international \naccounting standards by eliminating laborious manual financial reporting systems, promoting \naccountability, and providing appropriate financial information to the Government for economic \ndecision making; and (iii) conduct more comprehensive and updated control over public funds \nand help develop a cash management strategy to rationalize cash movements and holdings, \nespecially  at  the  atolls  and  islands.  The  Project  covers  nation-wide  Government  agencies \ninvolved in the PAS in Maldives including ministries, atoll offices, island offices14 and will provide \nthe financial reporting framework for public enterprises. \n \n                                                 \n13 Cash held in safes is estimated at Rf20 million and the total held in the Bank of Maldives on the account of atoll \nentities is estimated at a further Rf20 million (based on 31 December 1998 figures). The total amount is considered \nto be at least twice the amount reasonably needed to fund expenditure in the atolls. \n14 Island offices are established for inhabited islands, and currently there are 198 island offices. \n ", "     5\nB.  Components and Outputs \n15.  The  features  of  the  proposed  PAS  are  summarized  in  Appendix  2.15 The  project \ncomponents  include  (i)  the  restructuring  organization  of  ministries  and  departments  by \nestablishing finance sections in ministries, assigning accounting and internal audit function to \nMOFT, and establishing accounting units in the atolls and islands; (ii) strengthening the PAS by \nintroducing core government funds; chart of accounts; a ledger structure; and a voucher system \nfor ministries, atolls and islands; and preparing annual financial statements; (iii) streamlining the \nfunction of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) in the PAS by reassigning banking function \nto MMA, and establishing one public account; and (iv) supporting human resource development \nand training.  \n  \n1.  Organizational Restructuring of Ministries and Departments  \n \na.  Establishment of Finance Sections in Ministries \n \n16.  Presently 176 spending units are submitting budgets to MOFT. By introducing the new \nPAS, each ministry will be able to consolidate its own budget for presentation to MOFT as well \nas consolidate its accounting function by establishing a finance section. It will also enhance the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the overall administration of each ministry.  \n \n17.  Under this component, a finance section in charge of the accounting and budgeting \nfunctions will be established under the relevant administrative division of each ministry. The \nadministrative division of each ministry will comprise sections dealing with finance, human \nresources,  and  other  supporting  services.  The  finance  section  will  be  responsible  for  the \naccounting  functions  within  the  ministry,  which  includes  purchasing,  accounts  receivable, \naccounts payable, and reporting and budgeting, and will consolidate the ministry\u2019s budget for \nsubmission to MOFT.     \n \n    b.  Transfer of the Accounting Function from MMA to MOFT, and   \n      Strengthening of MOFT\u2019s Audit Functions \n \n18.  This  component  will  support  reorganization  of  MOFT,  to  provide  an  adequate \norganization structure for transferring the accounting function from MMA to MOFT and for \ndeveloping an internal audit function. This component will also establish the treasury division \nand internal audit bureau. \n \n19.  The treasury division will consist of an accounting office, a cash management and fund \nrelease office, and a borrowing and debt management office. The accounting office will examine \nand certify vouchers, handle data entry operations, process general ledger and journals entries, \nhandle  check  production,  and  maintain  computer  software  and  hardware.  Accordingly,  the \naccounting office will include an examination section, a data input section, a general ledger \nprocessing section, a check production section, a cashier\u2019s section, and a computer section. \nThe accounting office will require 25 to 30 staff.   \n \n                                                 \n15 The proposed PAS is similar to the system adopted in Australia and Singapore. The PAS models in Mauritius and \nSeychelles were also studied by the consultants under TA (footnote 3) and the voucher system and establishment \nof finance sections in ministries were incorporated into the design. \n ", "6     \n20.  Internal auditing provides an independent, objective assurance and consulting capacity \ndesigned to add value and improve an organization\u2019s operations. The internal audit bureau will \nreview, appraise, approve and report on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls and \nfinancial performance and resource utilization under MOFT. It will report to the Minister of State \nfor Finance and Treasury, as well as to each ministry and department it audits. These reports \nwill be available to the Maldives Audit Office and the President\u2019s Office. About 20 to 25 staff will \nbe needed.  \n   \n21.  By establishing the internal audit bureau in MOFT, the Maldives Audit Office will take \nover the role of a supreme audit institution. It will be responsible for certifying the annual \nfinancial statements of the Government, and be the Government\u2019s external auditor, reporting to \nthe People\u2019s Majlis through the President\u2019s Office.   \n \nc.  Establishment of Accounting Units \n \n22.  This component will help establish atoll and island accounting units.   \n \n      i.  Atoll Accounting Units \n \n23.  The atoll accounting units will take over the functions currently performed by individual \natoll entities, and create imprest accounts to provide cash funds for expenditures and to receive \nrevenue collection. This will centralize the expenditure and revenue function in one unit on each \natoll, compared with the existing decentralized management of revenue and expenditure. This \norganizational and functional change will strengthen financial control, and reduce the cash \nholdings and the physical movement of cash. In addition, a voucher system will be introduced to \nreplace the existing system of manually prepared books. \n \n      ii.  Island Accounting Units \n \n24.  The island accounting units will take over the functions currently performed by individual \nisland entities located away from the atoll offices and create a subimprest account for each \nisland (from the atoll imprest account) and introduce a voucher system to replace the existing \nsystem.  \n \n  2.  Strengthening of the PAS \n \n  a.  Basis of Accounting and Operational Mode of the PAS \n \n25.  The basic design and operational mode of the Project is to develop a computerized, \ndouble-entry, cash-basis PAS with a central ledger and check production unit under the control \nof MOFT.  \n \n26.  The current system focuses on the control of public money using a manual accounting \nsystem operated using 9 accounting books. By introducing a computerized PAS, reliable and \ntimely reporting of the financial status based on accurate transaction recording will be enabled. \nThe existing single-entry system does not produce adequate financial information for overall \nreporting purposes. Double entry is the basis for producing standardized financial statements \nwith  accuracy  and  reliability.  Accountability  and  transparency  of  financial  recording  and \nreporting will thus be enhanced. A cash-basis accounting system will provide all the necessary \nfinancial information for external reporting of government financial transactions. Furthermore, \nsuch a system, which is less complex than an accrual accounting system and requires less \n ", "     7\nextensive accounting skills, is also more consistent with the current Government capacity. The \ncentralized accounting system, which is generally associated with a cash-basis system, will \ntypically provide for one main financial report to be prepared. Under the proposed centralized \nsystem, MOFT will maintain the general ledger. MOFT will be responsible for the accounting \nprocesses as well as check production for the Government.   \n \n  b.  Core Government Funds  \n \n27.  This component will establish four core Government funds, which will group the public \nfunds for financial information processing.  The core funds will be the consolidated revenue \nfund, loan and capital works fund, advance fund, and trust fund; all will be linked to a single \nbank account at MMA.16  \n \n28.  This framework ensures compliance with two accounting principles: (i) expenses of an \nongoing nature are resourced from taxation and other recurrent revenue sources, while capital \nworks (and therefore assets) are funded from a loan fund or recurrent revenues set aside for the \npurpose;  and  (ii)  financial  information  is  clear  and  more  transparent  to  improve  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial management.  \n \n    c.  Chart of Accounts and Proposed Ledger Structure \n \n29.  The chart of accounts and structure of the ledger determine the manner in which data is \nclassified, sorted, and aggregated for financial reporting.  A structure of hierarchical reporting \nlevels  is  proposed  in  this  component,  which  will  accommodate  the  existing  reporting \nrequirements, and allow expansion to accommodate future requirements as they arise.  \n \n30.  The proposed ledger structure will comprise four categories with 11 ledgers: (i) fund and \ncentral  accounting  with  a  fund  ledger,  a  fund  general  ledger,  and  a  fund  sub-ledger; \n(ii) ministry/appropriation  with  a  ministry  appropriation  ledger  and  a  spending  unit  ledger; \n(iii) agency discretion with a program ledger, a project ledger, and a cost center ledger; and \n(iv) MOFT  analysis  with  a  input/revenue  classification  ledger  (RL9),17 an  IMF  government \nfinance statistics (GFS) economic type/revenue classification ledger (RL10),18 and an IMF GFS \nfunctional classification ledger (RL11).19 The ledger structure and chart of accounts for the \nproposed computerized PAS will be designed to ensure that (i) all accounting and internal \n                                                 \n16 The consolidated revenue fund will be the main operating fund of the Government. All recurrent revenues, i.e., \ntaxes, import duties, casual and other government revenues must be credited to this fund, while all recurrent \nexpenditures will be met from this fund through appropriations. The loan and capital works fund will encompass all \ntransactions made by the Government of a capital nature. All loans, borrowings, and onlending of monies are also \naccounted for through the ledger, including any monies borrowed on a long-term basis to fund recurrent budget \ndeficits. All grant funds and donations provided to finance capital projects are also accounted for within this fund. \nThe advance fund will address urgent and unforseen expenditures, for which there is no provision in current year\u2019s \nappropriations, with the approval of MOFT and will cover repayable advances to fund a business activity or \nenterprise. The trust fund will account for all moneys of governmental or private nature held in trust, and all \ntransactions against those moneys.   \n17 This ledger provides for a comprehensive classification system of the objectives, or nature of all expenditures \n(inputs), and for all revenues. \n18 This ledger provides for a coding structure that allows extraction of information in accordance with IMF\u2019s economic \ntype classification of expense, transactions in nonfinancial assets, and classification of revenue, thus enabling \nconsistent data presentation in the Government\u2019s budget papers with IMF\u2019s internationally accepted reporting \nstandard.  \n19 This ledger provides for a coding structure in accordance with IMF\u2019s functional classification of budget as published \nin IMF\u2019s GFS. \n ", "8     \ncontrol  requirements  are  met,  (ii)  public  bank  account  and  investment  management \nrequirements are satisfied, (iii) a budgetary control and enforcement regime is provided, (iv) all \nMOFT management information requirements are satisfied, (v) all proposed statutory reporting \nrequirements are met, (vi) all Government external reporting and internal management reporting \nrequirements are satisfied, and (vii) appropriate reports for the completion of the annual budget \npapers are produced including strategic budget sector data for analysis purposes aiming for the \nprogram budgeting to be introduced seamlessly. \n \n    d.  Ministries, Departments, Atolls, and Islands \u2013 Voucher System  \n \n31.  The existing system of account books in ministries, departments, atolls and islands will \nbe replaced by a voucher system, that will produce records to accommodate a centralized \ndouble-entry  accounting  system  to  be  generated  and  maintained  in  the  MOFT  central \naccounting system. The proposed public finance act20 will empower delegated persons to incur \nexpenditure  and  receive  funds,  and  will  introduce  prescribed  forms,  vouchers,  and  on-line \ncomputer reports from the ledger system, which will replace the existing system of hand-written \nbooks. \n \n32.  Cash funding will be provided by an imprest system through the atoll offices. Atoll \nentities (schools, hospitals, courts, etc) receive their budget allocations from their respective line \nministry, but their cash requirements will be met from the atoll office imprest advance, either \nfrom an imprest bank account or an imprest safe. A journal entry will be posted to the central \nledger to record the specific revenue or expenditure transaction. The central ledger will form the \nbasis for ledger reports to the entities and the annual financial statements published by MOFT.  \n \n33.  For the islands, a subimprest account structure is proposed. Funds held in the bank \naccounts or in safes for atoll entities located away from the atoll office will be transferred to a \nsubadvance at the island office, which will be replenished from the atoll imprest account. The \nrecoupment voucher for replenishment will provide the basis for a journal entry to be posted to \nthe central ledger at MOFT. \n \n    e.  Preparation of Annual Financial Statements \n \n34.  The  objective  of  government  financial  reporting  is  to  provide  the  principal  users  of \ngovernment financial reports with timely and accurate information that meets their requirements.  \nCurrently, annual accounts and financial information are not produced. This project component \nis designed to enable preparation of such financial statements, and the supporting legislative \nframework will mandate submission of these financial reports to the People\u2019s Majlis for their \nconsideration. The list of the proposed annual financial statements is provided in Appendix 3.   \n \n3.  Streamlining of the MMA\u2019s Function in the PAS \n \n35.  MMA, since its inception, has been undertaking the role of the Government accountant \nas well as its banker. This project component will (i) delineate the responsibilities of Government \nand  MMA  by  transferring  the  accounting  function  to  MOFT,  and  (ii)  reassign  the  banking \n                                                 \n20 The legislative framework supporting introduction of the new PAS includes the public finance act, and the public \nenterprises act, and the amendments to the Audit Act. This legislation is expected to be submitted to the People\u2019s \nMajlis during the October 2002 session. \n ", "     9\nfunction with MMA by establishing one public account for better control of public funds. In \nstreamlining MMA\u2019s function in the new PAS, four interim steps will be undertaken. \n \n36.  Establish One Public Account Supported by Appropriate Legislation. The public \naccount is to replace the existing 1,600 government bank accounts currently held by MMA. \nMoreover, as the Treasury General Account upon which the current system operates will be \nwith a consolidated revenue fund reflected in the ledger. \n \n37.  Review Government Bank Accounts, and Determine the Balance to be Carried \nForward into the Public Account. The nature and ownership of funds in the 1,600 government \nbank accounts held by MMA will be identified and the respective balances transferred to the \npublic account. The many individual government bank accounts will then be closed. \n \n38.  Review the MMA Ledger, and Determine the Balances to be Carried Forward into \nthe MOFT Ledger. A review of MMA\u2019s ledger will be carried out to identify balances that are to \nbe carried forward to the central general ledger held at MOFT. The ledger accounts for the \ngovernment ministries are held in MMA\u2019s books and will be reconciled with the ministries\u2019 \naccounts at the time of turnover to MOFT.  \n \n39.  Review of Other Matters That Will Impact On the New PAS. Outstanding debts owed \nby the ministries to MMA for foreign exchange purchases will need to be properly documented \nand assigned to the relevant ministries prior to implementing the new PAS.  \n \n4.   Human Resource Development and Training \n \n40.  The successful implementation of the new PAS is dependent on the existence of trained \nsupport staff capable of putting the procedures into practice under the new organizational \nstructure; and the aptitude of officers to interpret and take appropriate actions based on the \noutputs of the system. Sustainability, correct operation, and possible future development will \nrequire that competent staff are available. At the same time, the PAS will impact on other \nministries, departments, and atolls that provide financial returns to MOFT.21 This component will \nsupport the training needs for MOFT personnel undertaking activities related to this Project, \ntogether with those of any other agency submitting financial data. \n \n41.  Training needs will be assessed; the human resource needs of both primary and support \npersonnel will be examined, and the training activities prioritized. In the short term, staff should \nbe trained to implement the new PAS system, while training related to the creation of new \ninstitutional  structures  that  will  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  new  systems  would  be \nconsidered in the longer term. Moreover, preliminary consultations with stakeholders suggest \nthat 3\u20135% of the current employees  (in total less than 50 people) in the accounting field may \nneed to be utilized elsewhere in government services.22 Given the level of their training and \nprofessional  experience,  this  transition  is  expected  to  be  relatively  seamless.  However,  to \nensure that the current employees are appropriately redeployed within the Government, training \n                                                 \n21 The scope of the Project has been shared with senior and middle management of ministries, departments and \natolls for enhancing public awareness since the design stage of the Project through implementation of Capacity-\nbuilding TA (footnote 3). In October 2000, the first Ministerial Level Advisory Committee was held to outline the \ndesign of the Project and necessary strategies for introducing the new PAS. The Government held the second \nawareness meeting in October 2001. The third awareness workshops were held during 24-25 June 2002 in \nassociation with the President\u2019s Office focusing on the change of the legislative framework. \n22 Redundancy or retrenchment is not expected. This has not been an employment practice by the Government. \n ", "1  0   \nneeds assessment will be conducted for each staff member affected by the Project. The training \nneeds assessment will also consider any additional training for reskilling that may be needed \nbefore these staff could be absorbed by other government entities. Based on the training needs \nassessment, a strategy for developing human resources will be devised and implemented. \n \n42.  The  strategy  for  human  resource  development  will  comprise  (i)  designing  and \nimplementing  a  fast-track  career  planning  program  to  ensure  that  planning  and  financial \nmanagement  throughout  the  public  service  are  managed  effectively;  (ii)  establishing  a \ncompetency  framework  for  core  accounting,  budgeting,  and  planning  positions  (including \nsupporting  indicative  job  description;  (iii)  developing  revised  service  conditions  including \nincentives  for  rewarding  performance  for  the  accounting,  budgeting,  and  planning  cadres \nconsistent with the practices in the public service conditions of the Government, ensuring that \ngood staff are recruited and retained, and that positions are filled by competent officers; and \n(iv) setting establishment levels for all accounting, budgeting, and planning functions in the \npublic service based on the PAS. \n \n43.  Preliminary estimates indicate that 955 staff23 will have to be trained, consisting of \n408 staff from ministries and departments and 547 from atolls and islands. The training for \nimplementing the new PAS will include the financial legislative framework and instructions, \naccounting, planning and budgeting, auditing, computer skills, and management. \n \n44.  The training component of the Project will focus on (i) training key personnel during the \npreimplementation stage encompassing formal training on the PAS structure, as well as on-the-\njob training including secondment to a similar PAS agency overseas; (ii) developing a train the \ntrainer program to deal with the training of accounting staff especially in atolls and islands; \n(iii) establishing a training facility, with adequate equipment, within MOFT to deal with the \naccounting  training  needs  within  government  during  and  after  project  implementation;  and \n(iv) establishing  a  training  team  operating  from  this  training  facility,  to  implement  training \nprograms to improve the financial management and accounting skills of government officers \ninvolved with the PAS, which will ensure sustainability and future development of public finance, \nmanagement, and accounting skills. \n \nC.  Special Features \n45.  The Project includes several important features that are being introduced or enhanced \nunder the new PAS.  \n \n1.  Cash Management \n \n46.  A  single  public  bank  account  and  centralized  accounting  system  offers  significant \nadvantages over the present system of multiple accounts. It will provide a large, central pool of \ncash that can be managed and invested in a range of short- and long-term investments. This \nproject  component  will  support  the  development  of  investment  strategies  where  a  mix  of \ninvestments will be undertaken to ensure that sufficient cash is available to meet requirements, \nwhile keeping the reserve of idle and uninvested cash to a minimum.   \n \n47.  Investments are to be structured to provide short-term liquidity, and maintain a positive \ndaily account balance with a sufficient safety margin. Daily investment decisions (whether to \n                                                 \n23 A survey was conducted on the training requirements of ministries and atolls (Footnote 3). \n ", "     11\nincrease investments in short-term, highly liquid investments, or to draw upon them) will be \nunderpinned by an appropriate decision support model that calculates estimated net daily cash \nrequirements, given daily expenditure and revenue data from the central accounting system. A \nsingle  government  bank  account  and  a  clear  investment  strategy  will  result  in  significant \nadditional interest revenue for the Government. The investment strategy will be based on policy \ndecisions regarding the types of investments that can be made with the central pool of funds, \nincluding investments in foreign markets and short-term money markets. \n \n2.  Computerization and Information Technology  \n \n48.  The  proposed  PAS  can  only  be  properly  maintained  with  sufficient  backup  from \ncustomized  computerization  of  the  process.  This  project  component  will  support  such \ncomputerization. At present, only 10 personal computers (PCs) are available for budgeting and \naccounting activities in MOFT; they are either standalone or exist in small local peer-to-peer \nnetworked groups. All data are kept and reports generated using spreadsheets. Apart from a \nsingle pension database, no database management systems currently exist. Although usage is \nmostly rudimentary, all government agencies utilize computers. Moreover, a plan to network \nMOFT into a Windows-based networking environment is already under way. Under this plan, to \nbe completed in 2002, a local area network with basic networking facilities such as file sharing \nand E-mail with a dedicated connection to the Internet is envisaged. The plan also includes the \nprocurement of 32 additional PCs within 3 years for MOFT, of which 10 will be allocated to the \naccounts department, in tandem with the phased implementation schedule of the new PAS.24  \n \n49.  The computerized PAS will incorporate all the functionality of the central accounting \nsystem  proposed  for  the  Government.  The  system  will  be  capable  of  fully  supporting  the \ncentralized double-entry system of the PAS, adopting a phased approach to computerize the full \nsystem.  \n \n50.  The implementation of the computerized PAS will take place in three phases. In the first \nphase, only MOFT will have direct access to the computerized accounting system, while the \nother ministries, atolls, and islands will prepare the vouchers based on the ledger structure and \nchart of accounts, and provide them to MOFT. All data entry will take place in MOFT, with hard \nor soft copies of reports needed by other government agencies sent manually or via E-mail. The \nsecond phase will allow access to the computerized PAS by other ministries and agencies, but \naccess will be restricted to on line viewing of their account details. Web servers and dial-up \nservers should be in place before the initiation of this phase. On line data entry by other \nagencies into the computerized PAS will commence in phase three. Agencies will be able to log \nin to the system and update their records. The timing of each phase will be determined based \non the pace of training (on accounting, financial management, etc.) necessary for the relevant \npersonnel to implement the system and the ease with which the new PAS can replace the \nexisting methodology. \n \n51.  The accounting software package will be customized by the vendor to address the \nexisting needs and modalities of the Maldivian economy, data entry, and generation of various \nforms in Thaana (local script) as well as English. Thaana is right-to-left oriented as opposed to \nthe western method of left-to-right data entry. \n                                                 \n24 The hardware and application purchase survey was conducted under TA (footnote 5) and included in its \ninformation technology report. The Project includes a purchase of 80 PCs comprising 20 PCs for the Accounting \nOffice of MOFT, 10 PCs for the training function at MOFT, and 50 PCs for other agencies. \n ", "1  2   \n \n52.  The computerized accounting system will adopt the following operational principles. It \nneeds to be completely secure to ensure reliability and data integrity of the system. A suitable \nmechanism should be in place to ensure that no loss of data or unauthorized access occurs; \ndatabase  servers  should  reside  in  secured  rooms  with  all  possible  measures  to  minimize \naccidents; backup servers should reside in a different room if not a different building; and all \nnecessary  tools  to  avoid  data  loss  such  as  appropriate  antivirus  software,  transaction \nmanagement servers, etc. should be in place. Firewalls and intrusion detection software have to \nbe in place and under 24-hour surveillance, and any intrusion attempts attended to, where \npossible recorded and appropriate legal actions taken. For the long-term integrity of the system, \nlocal information technology (IT) experts, who could maintain and safeguard the system, will be \ntrained  during  implementation,  overseen  by  international  IT  consultants.  The  step-by-step \nconnectivity, starting from a passive form, and gradually enabling connections to other networks \nof government agencies will ensure that necessary security measures are in place for each \nstep. \n \n53.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  IT  Development  Project25 was  also  taken  into \nconsideration while preparing the implementation schedule of the proposed Project. The IT \nDevelopment Project is expected to establish a network that will connect government and \nparastatal agencies (including Vilingili and Hulhule islands) in Male\u2019 and 20 atolls by installing a \nfiber optic cable, enabling them to share information electronically with a view to improving the \nefficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  public  sector  management  by  2004.  The \ninstallation and operationalization of the new PAS has been synchronized with this schedule. \nThe completion of the government telecommunications network and the PAS will mutually \nsupport each other\u2019s objectives. The PAS will be one of the applications that all government \nagencies will need to use. The government network is expected by 2004, coinciding with the \ncomputerization  and  on-line  enquiry  stages  of  the  proposed  Project,  which  will  provide  a \nplatform to promote electronic public service. The availability of updated information on the \ngovernment network would also help the computerized PAS, and provide all agencies with a \nsecure and easy means for connecting to the PAS. The fiber optic backbone would ensure easy \nand fast connectivity to the PAS. Some of the other applications would include (i) updated \npopulation statistics, information on all civil servants, etc. to be used in the budget management \nmodule to estimate annual budgetary requirements; and (ii) updated records of companies and \nbusiness establishments and to maintain an updated list of suppliers, to facilitate ease of \ndelivery and contacts, and to be used by the Department of Inland Revenue to keep their data \non taxes up-to-date for future introduction of the business profit tax and property rental value \ntax; and (iii) online access to banks, and use by MMA to facilitate electronic funds transfer, \nwhich is a requirement of the computerized PAS. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n54.   The total cost of the Project is estimated at $6.265 million equivalent, of which $4.576 \nmillion (73%) is the foreign exchange cost and $1.689 million equivalent (27%) is the local \ncurrency cost. The total cost estimate includes physical and price contingencies, taxes, duties, \nand interest during the implementation period. Details on the project cost estimates are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Loan to the \nMaldives for Information Technology Development. Manila. \n ", "     13\nE.  Financing Plan \n55.   It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR 3,781,000 ($5 million equivalent) from its \nSpecial Funds resources to finance 80% of the total project cost. The proposed ADB loan will \nhave a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be \nthe Republic of the Maldives. The Borrower will make the loan available to MOFT through \nappropriate  budgetary  allocations.  The  Government  will  finance  $1.265  million  equivalent, \ncomprising 20% of the total project cost. The financing plan is shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total Cost  Percentage Share \nADB  4.576  0.424  5.000  80 \nGovernment  0.000  1.265  1.265  20 \nTotal  4.576  1.689  6.265  100 \nADB=Asian Development Bank \nSource: ADB Estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n56.  MOFT will be the Executing Agency for the Project, with overall operational responsibility \nfor project management. A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the Minister of State \nfor  Finance  and  Treasury  or  the  Minister\u2019s  appointee,  will  be  established  prior  to  the \ncommencement of the Project. The composition of the PSC will include director generals, or \nabove, from the President\u2019s Office; MMA; Audit Office; and ministries such as Planning and \nNational Development, Atolls Administration, Health, Education, Home Affairs, Communication, \nand Science and Technology; and the Department of External Resources. MOFT will provide \nthe secretarial services for the PSC. The PSC will meet at least quarterly, or more often as \nrequired, and in conjunction with ADB review missions, to oversee, provide policy guidance, and \nensure efficient and effective implementation of the Project.  \n \n57.  A  project  management  unit  (PMU)  will  be  established  in  MOFT  with  day-to-day \noperational responsibility for project management. A project director appointed from MOFT and \nacceptable to ADB will head the PMU. With the support of the consultants, the PMU will prepare \nnecessary draft plans and documentation to assist the PSC in making timely decisions or \nmaking recommendations for the higher authority of the Government for approval, with regard to \nproject  implementation,  including  (i)  a  software  tender  plan  and  purchase  and  installation \ndecision, (ii) a hardware tender plan, and purchase and installation decisions; (iii) closure of \nexisting bank accounts with MMA (about 1,600) and transferring balances to the new public \naccount; (iv) an accounting design plan (chart of accounts and ledgers for MOFT, ministries, \nand  atolls);  (v) annual  financial  statements  plan;  (vi)  a  MOFT  reorganization  plan;  (vii)  a \nministries reorganization plan for the public accounting and budgeting functions; (viii) a human \nresource skills assessment and career plan for staff involved in public accounting and budgeting \nfunctions;  (ix)  a  staff  plan  for  said  staff;  (x) a  training  plan;  (xi) accounting  software  and \nimplementation and customization plan; (xii) a pilot agency voucher system implementation \nplan;  (xiii)  PAS  implementation  plan  for  ministries;  (xiv)  an  atolls\u2019  and  islands\u2019  PAS \nimplementation plan; (xv) a project phase I batching system for the MOFT plan; (xvi) a project \n ", "1  4   \nphase 2 on-line enquiry plan; and (xvii) a project phase 3 on-line data entry plan. During project \nimplementation, the PMU will also monitor and provide monthly progress reports on project \nimplementation to the PSC and ADB. \n  \n58.  The technical advisory team will continue to operate with key members being technical \nexperts from the Audit Office, MMA, the proposed financial controller and chief accountant, as \nwell as any other members, as and when required. It will be chaired by the deputy minister of \nMOFT or a senior official of MOFT and will provide technical advice and support to the PMU.  \n \n59.   An organization chart showing project implementation and management arrangements \nis included in Appendix 5. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n60.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years commencing in January 2003 and ending \nin December 2005. The project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 6. During the \ninception  of  the  Project,  the  project  framework  will  be  reviewed  and  elaborated  by  the \nGovernment with assistance from the consultants incorporating the detailed project outputs and \nassociated performance targets. The performance management system to be implemented by \nthe Project will track the performance targets in the project framework. The consultants will also \nassist the Government develop a detailed implementation schedule linking the outputs in the \nproject framework to a time-bound plan. The schedule will reflect the major milestones and \nthematic aspects such as project review, the human resource inputs from the Government, and \nthe areas of consultant contribution. The project framework and the implementation schedule \nwill be used subsequently to monitor project progress and performance. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n61.  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Procurement for computer software and hardware will be carried out using \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Tentative procurement packages are provided in \nAppendix 7. The vendor of the software and hardware needed during the implementation of the \nnew PAS will provide a comprehensive maintenance contract for the first year including parts \nand service support, necessary backup, and updates especially for the software. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n62.  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  implementation  of  computerized  PAS  at \nMOFT, MMA, ministries, and atolls; (ii) human resource development and training; (iii) support \nfor tender selection of accounting software and hardware vendor; (iv) data and system support \nand security for computerization; and (v) support to the treasury division of MOFT. About 91 \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  75  persons-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required. The consulting services will be provided by a firm(s). Full \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  submitted  for  the  selection.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are provided in Appendix 8. Consultants to be engaged under the Project will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements for engaging domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n63.  The quality-based selection method will be utilized for consultant selection. The Project \nwill introduce a new accounting system to the public sector, involving various echelons of  \ngovernment both horizontally (various levels of hierarchy in each user department) and vertically \n ", "     15\n(various levels of public entities in Male\u2019, the atolls and the islands). The Project will have an \nimpact throughout the public infrastructure from the President\u2019s Office to the island accounting \noffices. Moreover, the Project necessities the use of highly specialized skills in the field of public \naccounting,  relevant  legislature,  policymaking,  and  institutional  and  staff  capacity  building. \nStrengthening the PAS and improving budget practices are prior agenda items for the Maldives. \nHence, the choice of the consultants to carry out the Project requires prioritization of their \ntechnical capabilities to carry out the tasks outlined in Appendix 8. All ADB-financed contracts \nwill ensure that the services provided do not violate any industrial or intellectual property right of \nany third party. \n \n64.  ADB Management has approved advance action for recruitment of consulting services \non the understanding that such advance action does not necessarily commit ADB to finance the \nProject. The PMU will start shortlisting consultants. ADB will assist the PMU by providing a long \nlist of consultants qualified for the assignment. \n \n5.    Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n65.  The PMU will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project, which will be \nprepared by the qualified accountant. The Project\u2019s statement of expenditures will be audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The PMU will provide ADB with copies of \nthe audited accounts and financial statements, together with the report of the auditors not more \nthan 9 months after the end of the financial year. The PMU will also provide ADB with the \nunaudited accounts and financial statements not more than 3 months after the end of the \nfinancial year. The PMU will submit regular progress reports on project implementation to ADB. \nWithin 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, the PMU will prepare a project \ncompletion report on the execution and initial operation of the facilities established under the \nProject, including costs of establishment, operation, and compliance with loan covenants.  \n \n6.    Disbursement Arrangements \n \n66.  Payment of eligible expenditures from the proceeds of the loan will be made either \nthrough  disbursement  procedures,  commitment  procedure  or  reimbursement  procedure  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, as amended from \ntime to time. MOFT will, immediately after the loan effectiveness, open and maintain a project \nimprest account for the PMU to ensure the timely release of loan proceeds for seamless \nimplementation of the Project. The initial amount to be allocated to the imprest account is \n$50,000. Imprest funds will be used essentially for small expenditure locally incurred, including \nincremental project administration costs.  \n \n7.    Project Performance Management and Evaluation  \n \n67.  The  project  performance  management  and  evaluation  system  comprises  (i)  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation to ascertain the impact of the Project on the beneficiaries; and \n(ii) performance monitoring and evaluation, which will measure the efficiency of the Project.  \n \n68.  Benefit monitoring and evaluation will include data on (i) level of financial returns on \ninvested public funds, (ii) the number of government bank accounts at MMA, (iii) the ease of \naccess to financial information by government agencies, and (iv) the level of staff resources \nused for government accounting functions including gender parity. The PMU will be responsible \nfor maintaining these data and evaluating project benefits.  \n \n ", "1  6   \n69.  Performance monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the PMU in conjunction \nwith ADB monitoring and review missions. They will monitor (i) the project implementation \nschedule, (ii) project costs, (iii) delivery of project components, and (iv) PAS sustainability.  \n \n70.  The consultant will assist the PMU with project performance management by preparing \ndraft regular progress reports incorporating performance indicators of the Project with respect to \nimprovement of the financial management system and capacity building of PAS-related staff. \n \n8.    Project Review  \n \n71.   The Project has a number of components and subcomponents to be implemented by \nvarious  government  departments.  To  ensure  the  timely  and  satisfactory  progress  of \nimplementation, the Project will be monitored closely at three levels by the project consultants, \nthe PMU they report to, and ADB. In addition to daily collaboration between the consultants and \nthe PMU, the consultants will submit monthly progress reports to the PMU, and ADB. ADB will \nfield monitoring missions after about 6 months (after software and hardware are procured and \nutilization begins), 18 months (after phase 1 of the Project starts at MOFT), and 32 months \n(after phase 3 starts) after loan effectiveness. In addition, two comprehensive reviews of the \nProject will be undertaken by the Government and ADB about 12 (after phase 1 is introduced in \nthe atolls and the islands) and 24 months (after phase 2 is introduced) after loan effectiveness. \nThe progress, performance, and implementation arrangements for the Project will be critically \nassessed during these reviews. If any weakness or slippages in the original implementation \nschedule are identified, the review will recommend remedial measures for consideration by the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  with  a  view  to  incorporating  appropriate  measures  to  address  any \nslippage. Prior to these reviews, MOFT will provide ADB with evaluation reports on the progress \nof the Project and any problems encountered in its implementation. The findings of the reviews, \nincluding an assessment of the progress made under the Project, will be discussed in tripartite \nmeetings of the consultant team, PMU, and ADB. If required, appropriate corrective measures \nwill  be  formulated  during  these  discussions  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and \nachievement of the objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n72.  The main benefit of the new PAS will be improved governance. The new PAS will \nestablish a system of tracking receipts and expenditures of all public transactions at the central, \natoll, and island level. Detailed financial/accounting data will then be used to generate financial \nstatements to guide public sector management in the short and medium term, as well as \nmacroeconomic planning in the longer term. Ultimately, the new PAS will improve efficiency, \nand enhance accountability and transparency, by achieving the overall objectives and meeting \nthe performance criteria required of a well-functioning, up-to-date PAS. The beneficiaries of \nthese improvements will all be citizens who will benefit from more efficient management of the \nnation\u2019s resources. The quality of governance in public finance management is critical for \npoverty  reduction,  which  facilitates  participatory,  pro-poor  policies  as  well  as  sound \nmacroeconomic management. Upgrading governance by introducing the new PAS will ensure \nthe transparent use of public funds, promote effective delivery of public services, and provide \ngood public expenditure management necessary for fiscal discipline, economic growth, and \nequity.   \n \n ", "     17\n73.  The Project will also entail the following main benefits relevant to good governance: \n(i) reliable and timely information on the financial position of the Government will enable the \nGovernment  to  conduct  more  competent  fiscal  policy  and  macroeconomic  management  to \nreduce the vulnerability to external shocks, (ii) reliable information on the fiscal status of the \ncountry will enhance the confidence of lenders and investors in the country, (iii) the preparations \nof external reports to meet internationally accepted accounting standards will enable better \nassessment  of  the  economic  situation  by  international  rating  agencies,  and  (iv)  significant \nreductions in idle cash holdings of ministries and atolls will lead to better financial returns on \npublic funds through improvements in fiscal discipline and cash management.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis   \n74.  A  benefit-cost  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  Project  (Appendix  9).  The  economic \ninternal rate of return is not computed since the majority of the benefits accruing from the \nProject are not quantifiable. A benefit that will have a significant fiscal impact is better financial \nreturns on public funds through improvements in fiscal discipline and cash management. The \nexistence of idle cash will be minimized if not totally eliminated. Excess funds can be properly \nchanneled to more effective investment. Gains will also be made in efficiency and savings in \nstaff time, which are a direct result of reducing the time of handling more than 1,600 bank \naccounts in favor of a single public bank account. Substantial time saving can also be achieved \nwhen the existing detailed record-keeping system is replaced by a simplified and cost-effective \nfully publicized system. Internal control procedures will also be improved. This will directly result \nin the reduction of misappropriation and overspending of government funds. Accountability for \npublic funds will increase, resulting in informed spending. \n \n75.  In  addition  to  the  gains  from  better  financial  management  of  Government  funds, \nsubstantial  benefits  are  expected  to  accrue  from  improved  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability of the public sector. Another benefit is the enhanced quality of external reports \nthat  would  meet  internationally  accepted  accounting  standards.  The  ability  to  prepare \nindependently  audited  government  financial  statements  will  lead  to  improvements  in \ninternational credit ratings and help the country to borrow funds in international markets at more \nfavorable terms in the long run.  \n   \n76.  The Project is expected to pave the way for the new PAS to be connected to the national \nnetwork enabling on line inquiry and printing of various financial reports of the government \nspending  units.  This  connectivity  will  bring  improvements  to  the  timeliness  and  quality  of \ndecision making. The availability of reliable and timely information in a centralized system will \nresult  in  more  informed  and  efficient  allocation  of  resources.  In  more  general  terms,  the \nproposed PAS will improve the entire financial management process.  \n   \n77.  The costs that will be incurred during project implementation will include: (i) consulting \nand computer software and hardware (ii) additional staff requirements especially in the initial \nstages  of  project  implementation,  such  as  staff  for  data  entry  in  MOFT  during  phase  1; \n(iii) system maintenance, and (iv) retraining employees.  \n \nC.   Social Impact \n78.  The enhanced legislative framework associated with the new PAS and the targeted \nsound  public  finance  management  will  contribute  to  the  Government's  ongoing  efforts  to \nimprove transparency, accountability, efficiency, and accuracy of public sector management. \nThe new PAS will also enhance the Government\u2019s ability to budget for, invest in, and monitor \n ", "1  8   \neffectively economic and social development activities. These factors would in due course \nsupport more robust economic growth, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. The major part \nof the Project is assistance to strengthen the PAS in the Government. No infrastructure is to be \nbuilt. Only computer equipment and software are to be purchased. The Project will not trigger \nADB\u2019s policies for involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. \n \n79.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  criteria,  participation  of  all \nstakeholders,  labor  issues,  gender  issues,  and  potential  risks  and  vulnerabilities  were \nconsidered in assessing the possible social and poverty impact of the Project on the Maldivian \neconomy. The Government\u2019s commitment at various levels is strong and stakeholders (i.e. \ngovernment  ministries,  departments,  and  institutions)  endorse  the  introduction  of  a  more \nstreamlined PAS. Key stakeholders such as the Audit Office, MMA, and MOFT especially \nexpressed their strong support for the new PAS to the Mission. However, more awareness \nneeds to be built of the structure and expected benefits of the new PAS, as well as how it is \nexpected  to  interface  with  the  existing  accounting  system  during  the  early  stages  of \nimplementation. \n \n80.  Sound  planning  and  delivery  of  training  on  the  PAS  is  essential  for  its  successful \nimplementation. The training opportunities within the new PAS will have an overall positive \nsocial impact, through capacity building of the labor force involved. Training will not only be \ndelivered in the initial stages of implementation, but thereafter as well, so that there is a \ncontinuous  supply  of  competent  staff  for  the  government  is  ensured  with  the  required \nmanagement, budgeting, accounting and computer skills.  \n \n81.  The Maldives has a progressive policy on gender in which achieving gender equality and \nequity are national objectives. Preliminary analysis indicates that women constitute 61% of \ngovernment  staff  involved  in  administering  and  monitoring  public  expenditures.  Moreover, \nwomen\u2019s labor force participation is projected to improve significantly since the country has \nachieved gender parity in primary and secondary educational participation maintaining gender \nequity in the intensive training for the PAS will necessitate that women receive due access to \ntraining and other opportunities of the Project.  \n \nD.  Risks \n82.  First, a significant potential risk is the delay in enactment of the public finance act, \namendment to the Audit Act, and the public enterprise act, and in issuing the relevant public \nfinance instructions. The preparation for draft acts and instructions in English and Dhivehi have \nbeen under way by extending work of consultants under the capacity-building TA (footnote 3). \nThe drafts are expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2002, with submission to the \nPeople\u2019s Majlis expected in the fourth quarter of 2002 or early 2003. The Government assures \nthat MOFT will have prepared these drafts and instructions and will have submitted them to the \nLaw Commission for approval and the Law Commission will have submitted the drafts (as \nfinalized by the Law Commission) to the People\u2019s Majlis before loan effectiveness. \n \n83.  Second, relating to the project management, another risk is decision making by the PSC. \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  necessary  draft  plans  (17  plans  as  described  in  para.  57)  and \ndocumentation to assist the PSC in making timely decisions or recommendations for the higher \nauthority of the Government for approval, if necessary. The background reasons for delayed \ndecision making are considered to include: (i) less frequent opportunities for decision-making \nmeetings,  (ii)  lack  of  project  administration  capacity  in  preparing  for  those  meetings,  and \n(iii) unwillingness to change and uncertainty about introducing a new system. If the decision \n ", "     19\nmaking  is  not  conducted  in  a  timely  manner,  it  may  cause  a  significant  delay  for  project \nimplementation. \n \n84.  Third, capacity building for relevant supporting staff in MOFT, ministries, atolls, and \nislands  is  critical  for  successful  project  implementation,  which  will  put  the  procedures  into \npractice under the new organization structure as well as enhance the aptitude of officers to \ninterpret and take appropriate actions based on the outputs of the system. The Project will \ninitially begin the training needs assessment in the second quarter following commencement of \nimplementation;  it  will  examine  the  human  resource  needs  of  both  primary  and  support \npersonnel, and training activities in the short term to implement the new PAS as well as in \nmedium term to create new institutional structures to ensure sustainability. The initial phase of \nhuman resource development and training components will last until the fourth quarter before \nstarting the first phase of the Project when MOFT will have direct access to the computerized \naccounting system. Successful capacity building during the first half of the implementation \nperiod is essential.  \n \nV.   ASSURANCES  \nA.  Specific Assurances \n85.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n86.  The Government will: \n \n(i)  ensure the establishment of the treasury division within 6 months after loan \neffectiveness; \n(ii)  ensure the remaining MOFT positions agreed with ADB, are filled as per Human \nResource Gap Study dated July 2002 (footnote 5) within 6 months after loan \neffectiveness; \n(iii)  provide the PMU with adequate budgetary and staff resources for its effective \noperation during project implementation in suitable office accommodation; \n(iv)  allocate  appropriate  budgetary  resources  to  concerned  ministries  for \ntransportation  and  lodging  for  participants  attending  training  sessions  and \nworkshops related to the Project; \n(v)  provide the required counterpart funds in a timely manner for the Project during \nimplementation; and ensure all necessary authorizations, including presidential \norders, are granted and approvals are given to ensure timely implementation of \nthe Project; \n(vi)  ensure  the  installation  of  the  project-related  computer  facilities  with  relevant \nministries and atolls has commenced within 9 months of loan effectiveness;  \n(vii)  ensure the commissioning of the project-related computer facilities with relevant \nministries and atolls has been completed by 24 months of loan effectiveness; \n(viii)  ensure that MOFT has prepared for approval the financial instructions relating to \nthe implementation of the amendments to the Audit Act, the public finance act \nand the public enterprise act within 1 month of their passage; \n(ix)  ensure that under the new PAS, no bank accounts containing public funds are  \nopened or operated without the written consent of MOFT; \n(x)  ensure that the transfer of balances from MMA to the central ledger at MOFT will \nbe subject to audit certification; and \n ", "2  0   \n(xi)  ensure that all purchases of foreign exchange are paid for and debited from the \nrelevant  ministry\u2019s  appropriate  expenditure  code  before  foreign  exchange  is \nreleased. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n87.  As conditions for the effectiveness of the Loan, the Government has agreed that: \n \n(i)  the PSC will be established and equipped with the services of an administrative \nassistant, and representatives from concerned ministries and agencies will be \nappointed to the PSC; \n(ii)  a  project  director,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  a  minimum  of  two  staff  will  be \nappointed to the PMU; \n(iii)  a financial controller or the chief accountant will be appointed to MOFT; and \n(iv)  MOFT will have submitted the draft public finance act, public enterprises act and \nthe amendments to the Audit Act26 (collectively referred to as the draft laws) to \nthe Law Commission, and the Law Commission will have submitted the draft \nlaws (as finalized by the Law Commission), to the People\u2019s Majlis. \n \nVI.    RECOMMENDATION \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 3,781,000 to the Republic of the Maldives for the Strengthening of the \nPublic Accounting System Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n            Tadao Chino \n                 President \n \n \n27 August 2002 \n  \n                                                 \n26 Audit Act is to be amended to include necessary cross-reference to accommodate the proposed provisions of the \npublic finance act and the public enterprise act. \n ", "  Appendix 1  21\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nTargets  Mechanism  Risks \nGoals        \n \n(cid:1)  (cid:1) \n(cid:1)  Improve the quality of  A set of agreed  Project steering \ngovernance by  annual financial  committee (PSC).  \nintroducing the new  statements on   (cid:1) \npublic accounting system  Government finances  Regular reports \n(PAS) with institutional  prepared by Ministry  from various user \nreorganization and  of Finance and  ministries and \ncapacity building aiming  Treasury (MOFT),  departments on \nto enhance efficiency,  audited by Audit  PAS \naccountability, and  Office, and presented  implementation \ntransparency, and  to the People's Majlis.

Introduction  \n1.  At present no system is in place to producing annual financial statements. Substantial \nchange is needed if the Government is to achieve its expected outcomes under the reform \nagenda.  The  proposed  system  is  designed  to  bring  about  improvements  in  the  levels  of \nefficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in the management of public funds and other public \nwealth. The objective of this Project is to improve the public accounting system (PAS) and \nenable the development of efficient and effective fiscal operations and macroeconomic policy. \nThe Project includes: (i) setting up a new PAS based on double-entry accounting principles; and \n(ii) training of government employees involved in the various aspects of the Project.  \n \nB.  Benefits \n \n1.  Gains In Efficiency \n \n2.  The  proposed  PAS  will  bring  about  fundamental  improvements  in  efficiency  and \neffectiveness to the existing accounting system of the Government. The new accounting system \nwill relieve the central bank, Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA), from performing the dual role \nof a government banker and administering government accounting functions. This new system \nwill enable proper segregation of functions and duties by transferring the accounting functions of \nGovernment to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) while the banking functions remain \nwith MMA. \n \n3.  The new system will also enable government ministries and departments to do away \nwith a number of accounting records currently being kept in the existing system without proper \nmonitoring and coordination by MOFT. Analysis of the project preparatory technical assistance \nconsultants show that based on the current workload a saving of at least 27% of total staff hours \nwould be achieved thereby creating an economic saving of approximately Rf9.4 million per year. \nAssuming that the government budget will grow in real terms at the same rate as in the last 5 \nyears or so, the savings will increase substantially. Existing staff can be redeployed in other \nareas of importance or retrained, or the staff complements could be reduced by natural attrition, \nthereby making the government operations more efficient and cost effective.  Implementation of \nthe Project as part of the reform process could require additional human resources, which may \nbe met in part by surplus staff from the finance sections. \n \n2.  Better and Timely Decision Making \n \n4.  The main aim of the existing system is to control the budget through the treasury general \naccount maintained at MMA. More than 60% of the monthly reports that are required to be \nsubmitted to MOFT by the various government-spending units arrive significantly late. Such \ninformation is critical for good and timely decision making and required by a number of users. \n \n5.  By  2004,  a  national  computer  network  will  likely  be  established  under  an  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financed project. This network together with the proposed PAS will \npave way for the new PAS to be connected to the national network, enabling on-line enquiry \nand printing of various financial reports by the government-spending units. This connectivity will \nbring improvements to the timeliness and quality of decisions made.  \n ", "  Appendix 9  43 \n3.  Transparency and Accountability \n \n6.  The centralized PAS supported by the legislative amendments will provide much needed \ntransparency and accountability to the management of public finance. \n4.  Human Resource Development \n \n7.  Qualified financial management capacity is lacking in MOFT. Hence, development of \nqualified personnel to manage the proposed accounting system will be critical to the success of \nthe  Project.  Good  cash  or  treasury  management  and  analytical  skills  will  be  essential \ningredients to successfully manage the PAS and achieve the expected outcomes. \n  5.  Improved Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms \n \n8.  Currently, the Government operates over 1,600 bank accounts at MMA. These accounts \nare  not  adequately  controlled.  Although  the  existing  budget  system  does  record  cash \ndisbursements made against the allocated budget for a particular item, it does not record the \ncommitments made against those funds at the time of ordering and registered commitments or \nnot.  \n \n9.  The establishment of the treasury division under the Project will become an effective \nmeans by which government can save substantial amounts of public money. The existing audit \nsystem lacks the resources and access to timely information.  Figures provided by the Maldives \nAudit Office indicate an annual average loss of Rf2 million due to lack of proper internal \ncontrols.  These  losses  have  occurred  through  fraud  and  inefficiency.  Availability  of  timely \ninformation will be enhanced in the new system and a more effective internal and external audit \nfunction would be carried out, which will be likely to act as a deterrent for parties engaging in \nmisappropriation and embezzlement of public funds. \n  \n10.  Another major reporting deficiency of the existing PAS is the inability of the system to \nproduce a set of audited financial statements of the Government.  At the end of each year, a \nconsolidated statement of actual expenditure against budgeted expenditure is prepared, but \ndoes not conform to international accounting standards, nor does the auditor general express \nan opinion on these financial statements of the Government. \n \n11.  The Project will specifically address these particular issues, and the proposed system \nshould be able to generate annual reports such as statements of: (i) assets and liabilities; \n(ii) consolidated  revenue  fund;  (iii)  general  loan  fund  and  capital  works;  (iv)  trust  fund; \n(v) revolving fund; (vi) contingency fund; and (vii) other customized reports.  \n \n12.  Such reports, if prepared and independently audited will facilitate the process of The \nMaldives obtaining a country credit rating, which is not currently available. Reports indicate that \nin  2001,  the  government  paid  over  Rf49  million  in  interest  on  foreign  loans.  Successful \nimplementation of this Project will enable generation of such financial statements, which will \nlead to improved credit ratings that will help the country to borrow funds in the international \nmarkets at much more favorable terms. Though this benefit could be substantial in the long run, \nwe have not quantified the savings in the benefit-cost analysis.   \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \n \nC.  Economic Costs of the Project \n \n13.  The new structure to be established under this Project will comprise an internal audit \nbureau, an accounting office, and modifications to the existing treasury functions. Based on \nexamples  in  other  countries  of  similar  size  and  similar  systems,  an  estimated  additional \n15 employees will be required to fill the posts that will be created under the new PAS and will \nincur an additional annual average cost of Rf0.99 million of salaries when the proposed system \nis fully established. In addition, the Project is expected to incur annual maintenance costs, \nabove Rf1 million per annum, and costs of staff retraining of approximately Rf1.62 million over 2 \nyears. The Project includes a large component of training. The extensive training should reduce \nthe extent of record keeping and data entry errors.          \n \nD.  Benefit\u2013Cost Analysis \n \n14.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was not computed since the \nmajority of the benefits that will accrue from the Project are not quantifiable. Instead of the \nEIRR, a matrix of the benefits and costs is given to highlight the costs and benefits that can be \nassociated with the Project. \n     \nCosts \nConsultancy, software and hardware  \u2022  Consultants will be engaged in training staff, \nimplementing the proposed accounting \nsystem, and drafting and translating  \nlegislation  \n\u2022  Software and hardware is necessary to set \nup the new system \nAdditional staff requirements  Additional staff required for the proposed \nstructure of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury \n(MOFT):  (i) the treasury division, (ii) the internal \naudit bureau \nSystem Maintenance  System needs periodic maintenance and \nupgrading \nEconomic cost of retraining employees  Training will be provided to current and new staff \nfor efficient and effective operation  \n \n ", "  Appendix 9  45 \n \nBenefits \n \nBenefits can be quite substantial but difficult to \nGood governance and accountability \nquantify. \n \n  Preparation of independently audited government \nExternal reports to meet internationally  financial statements will lead to improvements in \naccepted accounting standards  international credit rating and will help the country to \n  borrow funds in the international market at more \n  favorable terms in the long run. \n \nImproved transparency  The legislative amendments currently being drafted  \nwill enhance transparency and accountability in the \nmanagement of public finances. \nThe availability of meaningful and timely  Provide decision makers with more reliable, accurate, \ninformation  and timely information, resulting in more timely and \nbetter quality decisions. \n \nSignificant reductions in cash holdings in atolls  This will help increase the cash pool available for \ninvestment (physical and/or financial). \nBetter financial returns on public funds through  Savings will be obtained through investment of idle \nimprovements in fiscal discipline and cash  cash that is existing in the current system. \nmanagement \nSavings on interest payments to the Maldives \nMonetary Authority (MMA) \nReplacing the existing Government 1,600 bank  The existing manual system will be replaced by a \naccounts at MMA and commercial banks with  much simpler and more cost-effective mechanism, \na single public bank account  resulting in substantial time savings. \nImproved accounting procedures resulting in   \nstaff time savings \n \n \nIt is envisioned that fraud and overspending will be \nImproved Internal controls \nreduced due to the successful implementation of the \nPAS. \n \nE.  Overall Fiscal Impact \n \n15.  The new PAS will enable and facilitate better and greater fiscal discipline.   \n \n16.  Under  the  new  system,  the  existing  1,600  bank  accounts  held  with  MMA  will  be \nconsolidated  into  a  single  public  account  to  enhance  control  over  public  monies.  This \nconsolidation process will bring about a significant saving in the total staff hours required for the \nday-to-day operations. The proposed financial planning division and the cash management \nsection of MOFT could then play a more effective role in the management of government \nfinances  by  creating  savings  through  the  opportunities  that  will  be  created  with  the \nimplementation of the proposed system.   \n \n17.  The flow of cash between atoll spending units and Male\u2019 is expected to be significantly \nreduced under the new system. As estimates indicate that up to Rf30 million-40 million are at \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \ntimes held in such atoll offices, more effective management could in effect offset the deficit \nfinancing of MOFT by MMA. \n \n18.  MOFT reports also indicate that approximately Rf576 million of government funds and \ntrust monies are deposited and kept with MMA for significantly long durations without being \nproperly managed.  The proposed new accounting system will lead to consolidation of all such \nidle funds and pool them to get a better financial return on such deposits. \n \n19.  Utilization  of  such  deposits  in  the  cash  management  process  would  bring  about \nsignificant savings in net domestic interest payments by MOFT. Currently, MOFT incurs an \naverage interest expense of Rf65 million per annum on loans obtained from MMA. According to \nestimates, after providing for adequate liquid funds for day-to-day operations, at least 40% of \nsuch idle funds could be invested. Assuming investment of only 25% of total idle funds at an \ninterest rate of 6% (MMA lending rate) will generate an average annual return of Rf9.1 million in \ninterest earnings that could be used to offset the deficit financing. \n \n20.  Furthermore lack of a commitment register is one of the biggest weaknesses in budget \ncontrol that have resulted in overspending. As a consequence, approximately an average of \nRf1.8 million would be incurred each year by various government units over and above the \nallocated budget. This has become a common occurrence, and is often realized only at a much \nlater stage. More importantly, this disrupts the allocation of resources and hinders effective \nplanning  of  economic  development  activities.  The  new  system  will  improve  the  monitoring \nmechanisms and rectify such situations in a timely manner. \n \n21.  The overall fiscal impact of the Project in the medium to long term will be clearly positive. \nProvided that the proposed components of this Project are implemented effectively along with \ngood cash management, the resulting outcomes and economic benefits will by far outweigh the \ncosts associated with the Project and the proposed PAS is thus expected to bring about \nsubstantial economic benefits to the country.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20020909151833Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 4.0 for Windows", "ModDate": "D:20021003153935+08'00'"}}
