The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) is a statutory body under the \nMinistry of Urban Development, Government of India (the Government). It was constituted \nunder the National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985, enacted by parliament with the \nconcurrence of the legislatures of the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.1 The \nmandate of NCRPB is to develop systematically India\u2019s National Capital Region (NCR), which \ncovers  33,578  square  kilometers  spanning  14  districts  in  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar \nPradesh, and the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. NCRPB lays emphasis on building \nwater supply, sewerage, and sanitation infrastructure in the NCR; and plans to scale up support \nfor urban infrastructure development significantly in the next 5 years. The Government has \nrequested a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to develop the NCRPB project. ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan, 2008\u2013\n2010, supports urban infrastructure development, especially water supply and sewerage. It has \nprovisions for PPTA in 2008 for preparing the NCRPB project and for a loan project in 2010.2  \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Delhi during 28\u201329 February 2008 to formulate the \ntechnical assistance (TA) for preparing the NCRPB project.3 The Mission met the member \nSecretary and key officials of NCRPB; the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Urban Development; and \nrepresentatives of the implementing agencies (IAs) that obtain financial support from NCRPB. \nBased on discussions with the stakeholders and a review of related documents and experiences \nof earlier ADB assistance to India, the Mission reached an understanding with the Government \non  the  purpose,  output,  methodology,  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), and terms of \nreference for consultant support under the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The NCR is a key economic regional hub in India, and its importance has grown with \nIndia\u2019s high economic growth in the past decade. This growth and the associated increase in \npopulation  have  put  severe  pressure  on  urban  infrastructure  in  the  NCR.  Economic \nopportunities  have  attracted  thousands  of  migrant  laborers,  leading  to  overcrowding  and \nexpansion of slums in urban fringes. Without adequate investment in priority urban infrastructure, \neconomic growth in the NCR might slow down. Investments in urban infrastructure and basic \nservices are also required to improve the quality of life of the urban poor. The NCR Regional \nPlan, 2021, aims to develop 7 metro centers and 11 regional centers. NCRPB is facilitating state \ngovernments, urban local bodies (ULBs), and development authorities to prepare master plans, \ndevelopment plans, and project plans for creating basic urban infrastructure in NCR towns and \ncities to achieve the goals set in the Regional Plan. The projects identified by NCRPB for the \n11th  Five  Year  Plan,  2007\u20132012,  involve  a  total  outlay  of  Rs150  billion  (approximately \n$3.8 billion) including a loan component of Rs110 billion ($2.8 billion).  \n \n4.  In addition to its lead role in regional urban planning, NCRPB is an urban infrastructure \nfinancial intermediary\u2014it offers concession lending for effective implementation of the Regional \nPlan, providing funds at competitive interest rates that include a rebate system. The rebate \nsystem encourages state governments and ULBs in the region to adopt planned development of \ntowns and cities, taking into account projected population levels and policies prescribed in \n                                                 \n1  Available: http://urbanindia.nic.in/moud/programme/dd/ncrpb_act.pdf  \n2  ADB. 2007. India: Country Operations Business Plan, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 April 2008. \n ", "2   \nNCRPB\u2019s  regional  plans.  NCRPB  has  provided  financial  assistance  to  participating  state \ngovernments,  ULBs,  housing  boards,  development  authorities,  and  other  state  owned \nenterprises for infrastructure development projects in the NCR, and identified counter-magnet \narea towns4 over the last 20 years. NCRPB has financed 171 infrastructure projects involving \ntotal outlays exceeding Rs113 billion ($2.8 billion) so far. It has sanctioned loans amounting to \nRs39.02 billion ($1.0 billion) and disbursed Rs26.28 billion ($0.7 billion) as of 31 March 2007.  \n \n5.  NCRPB raises finance through grants from the Government, contribution from the NCT \nof Delhi, funds from the capital market, and internal accruals. In the last decade, it has raised \nabout Rs9 billion ($225 million) through this process. The pattern of loan assistance provided by \nNCRPB  is  25:75\u2014the  borrowing  agency  contributes  25%  and  the  NCRPB  loan  covers  a \nmaximum  75%  of  the  project  cost.  NCRPB\u2019s  fund-raising  operations  have  secured  AAA \n(structure obligation) rating for the last few years. However, because of recent developments in \nthe capital markets where spreads between sovereign bonds and AAA borrowers have widened, \nthe cost of capital for NCRPB from the local bond market has increased significantly. Hence, \nNCRPB is exploring alternative sources of financing, including sovereign guaranteed loans from \nmultilateral lending institutions. \n \n6.  To achieve and manage the targeted lending of Rs110 billion ($2.8 billion) in the next \n5 years,  NCRPB  requires  lending  as  well  as  nonlending  support  from  ADB.  To  develop \ninstitutional capacity  for  undertaking  the  increased  challenges  of  NCRPB\u2019s  corporate  plan, \nstrategies, and resource mobilization plan, ADB is providing advisory TA (ADTA).5 However, this \nwill not be enough to meet the TA needs of NCRPB and its IAs over the next 5 years, especially \nfor implementation support for the scaled-up investment program. Hence, the proposed lending \nsupport to NCRPB must also examine the need for TA loan support for (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of NCRPB and the IAs for origination of projects; (ii) conducting rigorous technical, \nfinancial, economic, environment, and social safeguard due diligence; (iii) ensuring that projects \nprotect the interests of the poor and women (Appendix 2); (iv) structuring projects for public-\nprivate partnerships (PPPs); (v) effective project appraisal; (vi) monitoring for quality assurance; \n(vii) procurement; (viii) timely implementation; and (ix) other aspects. \n \n7.  Additional issues to be examined include policy-related disparities within the NCR that \nwork against moving population out of the NCT\u2014such as local taxation rates (tax on fuel is \nlower in the NCT than in other NCR states) and difficulties in interstate movement of goods and \npeople. The counter-magnet towns are far from Delhi and might not be big or attractive enough \nto have any influence in relation to the population distribution in the NCT. This entails critical \nreview of the impact of various investments in counter-magnet towns. ADB investments within \nthe  NCR  and  counter-magnet  towns  must  be  reviewed  to  assess  the  need  for  additional \ninvestments and to assess the absorptive capacity of these towns.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The goal of the ensuing project loan is to help people and businesses in the NCR to \naccess systematically planned, high quality, and affordable urban infrastructure. The outcome of \n                                                 \n4  The Regional Plan 2001 identified the following counter-magnet areas to the NCR for the first stage intervention: \nHissar in Haryana, Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, Patiala in Punjab, Kota in Rajasthan, and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. \nADB\u2019s projects support Kota, Alwar, and Gwalior.  \n5  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to India for Capacity Development of the National Capital Region Planning \nBoard. Manila. \n ", "  3\nthe ensuing project loan is to (i) improve the quality of basic urban services in the NCR, \n(ii) reduce in-migration to Delhi and ensure the orderly development of the NCR, (iii) develop \ncounter-magnet towns, and (iv) accelerate economic growth in the NCR. The main outcome of \nthe TA is to design a project that identifies effective financing support to NCRPB as well as a TA \nloan to NCRPB and IAs to ensure effective use of the funds.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will undertake (i) an institutional assessment, including safeguards assessment, \nof NCRPB as well as various IAs that work with NCRPB; (ii) review of the road map for \ndevelopment  of  the  NCR  as  laid  out  in  the  Regional  Plan,  and  assessment  of  priority \ninvestments  to  accelerate  implementation  of  the  Regional  Plan  (including  investments  in \ncounter-magnet towns); (iii) design of a lending program for NCRPB; and (iv) design of a TA \nloan program for NCRPB and the IAs based on the institutional assessment to improve capacity \nand accelerate urban infrastructure development in the NCR. \n \n10.  The TA will use various methods to conduct the situation analysis. It will review relevant \nnational policies, laws, and plan documents; the NCR Regional Plan and NCRPB\u2019s investment \nplans; NCRPB\u2019s financial management and governance procedures and practices; local laws \nand relevant policies; safeguard laws and policies; and the capital markets and urban financing \nsituation. It will analyze ways of integrating other government efforts to accelerate PPPs as well \nas related TA support from ADB. It will examine a sample of detailed project reports, quality \nassurance,  and  monitoring  mechanisms  for  project  implementation;  and  assess  the \neffectiveness of institutional arrangements for project implementation. The TA will support key \ninformant interviews with key stakeholders, including senior officials of NCRPB and IAs; senior \nofficials of the Ministry of Urban Development and state departments of urban development; \nrepresentatives  from  agencies  responsible  for  safeguards  and  standards  of  safeguards; \nrepresentatives  from  nongovernment  agencies  working  for  NCR  urban  development; \nrepresentatives  from  the  private  sector  involved  in  urban  infrastructure  development;  and \nrepresentatives from associations of business enterprises, academia, urban legal experts, and \nmedia. \n \n11.  The TA will support surveys and focus group discussions to assess baseline quality of \nlife parameters; quality of life among slum dwellers; water supply, sewerage, and sanitation; \nenvironment pollution; willingness to pay for basic services as part of the poverty and social \nassessment; and travel time and infrastructure barriers to business enterprises in the NCR. The \nTA will support review of lessons from relevant ADB projects, including project completion \nreports and ADB Operations Evaluation Department reports;6 and it will review ADB investments \nin urban areas of the NCR and counter-magnet towns. A specialized credit rating agency \n(consultants) will be hired to conduct independent credit rating of NCRPB. The scope of the TA \nwill complement the ongoing ADTA (footnote 5), and the steering committee will be tasked with \nensuring complementariness. Institutional, financial, and safeguard outputs from the ADTA will \nbe used as background analytical material by the PPTA. \n \n12.  The outputs of the TA will include an inception report, situation analysis, draft final report, \nand final report that will cover broadly the following aspects: \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent. The amount of $700,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $175,000  equivalent  in  kind  to  cover \nremuneration,  provision  of  office  accommodation  and  facilities,  and  local  transport  for \ncounterpart  staff.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  NCRPB will be the Executing Agency. The steering committee will be chaired by the \nmember secretary of NCRPB; and will consist of senior NCRPB officers and representatives \nfrom the Ministry of Urban Development, Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of \nFinance, participating IAs, and nongovernment organizations engaged in urban development in \nthe NCR. The finance director of NCRPB will be the project director and the convener of the \nsteering committee. The steering committee will meet at least once a month during the first \n4 months of TA implementation and at least once every 2 months during the remainder of the \nTA implementation period to guide and review TA progress. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will require 48 person-\nmonths  (8  international  and  40  national)  of  consulting  services.  The  indicative  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 4. The three international consultants will include a lead financial \nspecialist (4 person-months), a lead environment specialist (2 person-months), and a lead social \ndevelopment and resettlement specialist (2 person-months).

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is presented in the approach paper to the 11th Five Year Plan, 2007\u2013\n2012. It sets a high growth rate of 10% by the end of the plan period, and aims to reduce disparities across regions \nand communities by ensuring access to basic physical infrastructure as well as health and education services for all. \nThe country operations business plan 2008\u20132010a of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been prepared as part \nof the larger India country partnership strategy 2008\u20132012, which is expected to be finalized in 2008. The country \npartnership strategy is being closely aligned with the priorities of India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan and will support the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts toward promoting broad-based and inclusive growth, catalyzing investments, and improving the \neffectiveness of development interventions. Support for urban infrastructure development is a core focus of ADB\u2019s \nIndia assistance strategy over 2008\u20132010.  \n \nThe technical assistance (TA), which aims to prepare an investment project for urban infrastructure and services, will \ncontribute to social development by (i) supporting regional and integrated development in the National Capital Region \n(NCR); (ii) boosting economic growth in the NCR and creating more jobs; (iii) improving urban infrastructure including \nwater supply, sewerage, and sanitation; and (iv) enhancing the quality of life of people living in the NCR. The project \nwill contribute to human development, public health improvement, and enhanced productivity.  \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  Not applicable. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? \nPoverty and social analysis will be carried out to determine the socioeconomic profile of the population, urban \npoverty incidence, the nature and characteristics of poverty, and perceived priorities of the poor. The poverty \nanalysis will track potential adverse effects over the short, medium, and long term for the poor and excluded groups. \nIt will review options to eliminate such negative effects through design changes or mitigating measures to be \nincluded in the project design and costed as part of the total project cost. The poverty analysis will also review \noptions to extend or enhance benefits for the poor and exclude options through design changes in the scope and/or \npace of the policy conditions. \n  \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \nInternational and national consultants are being proposed to conduct social safeguard and social development due \ndiligence in addition to adequate funds being allocated for studies and surveys. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, \npro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThere is opportunity for pro-poor design by concentrating the investments that have maximum impact on poverty \nalleviation and improving the quality of life of the poor, and by geographically targeting some investments toward \nupgrading of slums.  \n \n ", "Appendix 2  9\n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded \nbenefit from the project? \nPeople and enterprises in the NCR are the primary beneficiaries of the proposed project. The poor and socially \nexcluded will benefit directly and indirectly. Economic growth boosted by project-financed infrastructure investments \nwill increase job opportunities for the poor. Investments in water supply, sewerage, and sanitation will help the poor \ndirectly by improving access to basic urban services. \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nUrban infrastructure\u2014including water supply, sewerage, sanitation, roads, and solid waste management\u2014are \ncritical needs of people living in or commuting to urban areas of the NCR. Because of previous poor investments in \nurban infrastructure and rapid urbanization, urban infrastructure facilities are either run-down or nonexistent in many \nparts of the NCR. Poor urban infrastructure has stunted economic growth and increased the vulnerability of urban \nresidents, especially the poor. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the \nproject address them? \nPotential constraints are the poor financial status of urban local bodies (ULBs), their limited access to capital for \nurban infrastructure development, and their limited capacity to design and implement projects. The proposed \nproject, among others, will increase ULBs\u2019 access to competitively priced capital to undertake priority urban \ninfrastructure projects. An associated advisory TA will be addressing the capacity constraints. b \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nPotential initial stakeholders include the Ministry of Urban Development, state governments, National Capital Region \nPlanning  Board  (NCRPB),  ULBs  and  urban  state-owned  enterprises  operating  in  the  NCR,  nongovernment \nagencies, NCR citizens, NCR businesses, etc. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nGiven the wide variety of stakeholders, various types of consultations and stakeholder participation will be required \nduring the PPTA. These include workshops, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and involvement of \nnongovernment organizations and community-based organizations. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nBased on the stakeholder analysis, a participation strategy/plan will be prepared outlining how to involve each \nstakeholder at different stages of the project cycle. Emphasis will be on ensuring fair representation of each group\u2019s \ninterest, especially the poor and excluded. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project \nor program? \nWomen suffer the most from poor access to water supply, sewerage, sanitation, and solid waste management as \nthey are primarily responsible for managing these services in households. Poor access to these services leads to \ndrudgery, poor hygienic working and living conditions, vulnerability to abuse, and hardship. By improving access to \nthese basic urban services for the poor, the project will help in reducing the drudgery of women in the project area \nand improve their quality of life. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?      Yes          No     \nWomen will benefit from the investments in water supply, solid waste, and sanitation to be supported by the \nproposed project by reducing the drudgery associated with lack of such services or poor services.
