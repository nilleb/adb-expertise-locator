INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the \nCentral and West Asia region comprise Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. These countries are a \nheterogeneous group, with different economic systems and constraints to growth. They also \nhave some important common features. First, countries that were part of the former Soviet \nUnion  are  still  transition  economies.  Second,  most  are  landlocked,  increasing  their \ntransportation costs; nontrade barriers are high. Third, their exports show little diversification. \nThe future of the region lies in implementing a program that helps accelerate the pace of their \nstructural  transformation.  This  is  the  process  through  which  gross  domestic  product  and \nemployment shares shift from sectors of lower productivity into sectors of higher productivity. \nThe process must be induced and facilitated through a set of interventions in different areas, \nbeginning with reforms to initiate and support change. Reforms are needed to improve the \nefficiency of service provision and to allow the private sector to participate. Second, to facilitate \ntheir economic transformation, these countries need to invest in the modernization of their \ntransport, energy, and urban systems. At the same time, the process of transformation may \nchange infrastructure requirements. These three sectors are critical for structural transformation \nand,  consequently,  for  the  development  of  the  region.  Investment  in  general,  and  in \ninfrastructure in particular, has always been considered the key engine of development. For this \nreason,  ADB  assistance  in  energy,  transport,  and  urban  services  are  crucial  for  the \ndevelopment aspirations of the Central and West Asia region, as they represent investments in \ninfrastructure that will create the necessary capacity to facilitate country development.  \n \n2.  The regional departments of ADB are preparing road maps that will improve the quality \nof the policy dialogue with their corresponding member countries. These road maps will help the \nDMCs to better plan their investment needs in the medium and long term. The Central and West \nAsia Department (CWRD) is contributing to this process by preparing road maps for the energy, \ntransport, and urban services sectors of its client countries. This technical assistance (TA) will \nprovide resources to  develop a template and a generic methodology  for road maps for the \nthree sectors. For reasons of priority, the TA will finance country road maps for the three sectors \nfor two countries: Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. CWRD will also prepare regional road maps by \nsector for the whole Central and West Asia region. This will contribute to the development of the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program. The preparation of road maps for other \nCentral and West Asia countries will follow at a later stage using similar methodologies, subject \nto additional financing. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The experience of today\u2019s developed countries shows that to succeed development \nrequires the involvement of the public sector through the provision of basic infrastructure and \npublic  services.  Available  empirical  evidence  shows  that  public  investment  in  these  areas \nencourages private investment. Developed country experience also indicates that investment \nactivities need to be planned and coordinated with the private sector to avoid mismatches, \nbottlenecks, and waste of scarce resources. Radically changing cities, energy and transport \nsystems will require political will, leadership, good management and the active participation of \nthe private sector. This is because these changes will probably require reforms, which are \nalways  surrounded  by  problems  of  accountability.  This  requires  public  and  private  sectors \nviewed as strategic collaborators.  \n \n ", "2  \n4.  Optimal planning and coordination of investments are particularly relevant for the Central \nand  West  Asia  region,  where  often  all  three  areas  of  infrastructure  need  replacement  or \nupgrading, or they simply need to be provided. Also, careful planning of investment is important \nas it plays a dual role in the economy, both as expenditure (demand side) and as the source of \ncapacity  (supply  side,  i.e.,  addition  to  capital  accumulation).  This  dual  nature  creates  a \nmismatch, as the two effects have different time horizons: while the impact of demand is \nexhausted rather quickly, that of capacity lasts longer. \n \n5.  Investment has microeconomic and macroeconomic consequences for the economy. In \nthe first case, it contributes significantly to the improvement of people\u2019s quality of life (e.g., \nthrough the provision of public goods such as basic urban services). In the second case, an \nincrease in investment may cause inflationary pressures and imbalances in the economy. A \nbalanced development plan requires coherent planning, both of the forthcoming volume of \ninvestment and of its composition, which must be directed purposefully toward the breaking of \nsupply bottlenecks, for example, in energy.  \n \n6.  The role of urban areas must be redefined to facilitate the transformation of traditional \nrural-based economies into modern agroprocessing centers, and to facilitate the development of \nclusters of production and services. This requires a well-articulated urban and regional spatial \nstructure. Often, however, urbanization is not essentially due to economic transformation, but is \nthe result of migration, with the consequence that urban areas grow haphazardly. For this \nreason, planners must understand how urbanization might evolve in the Central and West Asia \ncountries,  explore  the  many  problems  facing  fast-growing  cities  (e.g.,  affordable  housing, \nuntreated sewage, mass transit, water shortage, solid waste), and discuss what policy makers \ncan do to mitigate the strains of urban life and maximize the opportunities offered by cities. \nCities in the People\u2019s Republic of China, South Africa, and the United Kingdom were turned \naround in as little as 10 years. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 indicates that \u201cto contribute to public health, \nADB  will  invest  in  water,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  systems.\u201d1 Urban  areas  are \nassumed to drive economic growth and employment for rural and regional development. Indeed, \ncities play a crucial role in national economic growth. This has been the case in Asia, where \nurbanization rates increased very quickly during the last 30 years. Often, urbanization was \nassociated  with  the  development  of  manufacturing.  More  recently,  it  is  also  linked  to  the \ndevelopment of booming service sectors. However, today many cities struggle with the impact \nof  fast  growth.  Overcrowding,  environmental  degradation,  high  land  costs,  and  worsening \nmobility  of  people  and  goods  impact  negatively  on  industrial  and  business  activities  and \nproductivity in general. Therefore, a strategic dialogue with some of the leading global players in \nwater supply and sanitation, solid waste management, and urban transport is absolutely critical \nto foster innovative thinking, to enhance private sector participation, and to provide a solid \nresponse to the enormous transformation challenge that Central Asia faces. \n \n7.  Although Central and West Asia is the only Asian region that is not import-dependent on \nenergy, the complex issues that encompass security (i.e., ensuring that an area has adequate, \naffordable, and sustainable sources of energy) are vital for ensuring its economic growth. For \nthis, governments need to know where, how, and what kind of power plants and pipelines to \nbuild. Rapid growth\u2014economic, demographic, urban, and industrial\u2014is pushing the demand for \nenergy, and many of the energy linkages that predated the dissolution of the former Soviet \nUnion no longer exist. This creates certain regional challenges. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila ( p. 18). ", "3 \n \n8.  Having modern transport and logistics systems that allow the efficient movement of \ngoods and people is fundamental to support structural transformation in a modern economy. A \nmodern and efficient transportation system is also important because it is complementary to the \ndevelopment of some economic sectors, e.g., tourism. To achieve this, Strategy 2020 indicates \nthat ADB will invest in infrastructure to improve transport and communication connectivity within \nand between DMCs.  \n9.  Infrastructure  investment  cannot  be  limited  to  building  physical  assets;  governance, \nplanning, proactive sector policies in job creation, public transportation, affordable housing, \nshape of urban expansion, and climate change mitigation are all part of the development puzzle. \nAlong these lines, ADB will emphasize the delivery of infrastructure services that will create an \nenabling  environment  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  private  sector  engagement.  In \nparticular, ADB will endeavor to (i) build DMCs\u2019 capacity for better infrastructure management, \n(ii) promote institutional and policy reforms that enhance operating efficiency and sustainability \nof infrastructure projects, and (iii) support logistical systems to increase trade and investment by \nbuilding on basic infrastructure strengths. \n \n10.  ADB will use the road maps as planning tools to help program the different activities at \nthe department level so as to maximize the impact of the Bank\u2019s financing. Specifically, road \nmaps will assist the departments to redefine their strategic direction by acting as a tool for \nstrategic planning. They will also help in discussions with governments and clients in general, as \na policy tool. Finally, they will assist the relevant divisions plan their portfolio and new pipeline of \nactivities, as a tool to guide operations. \n  \n11.  Well-defined road maps will help accelerate the modernization of the countries\u2019 transport, \nenergy, and urban services sectors, as well as increase their efficiency. This way, ADB intends \nto provide innovative solutions to problems in the three sectors.2 Country and regional road \nmaps will be strategic documents that determine the current state of affairs and recommend \npaths forward aimed at meeting a set of objectives. Key strategic objectives are sustainable \ncountry  and  regional  growth  and  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  higher  economic \nintegration. Road maps help meet these objectives by identifying investments, policy changes, \nand other strategies that have the greatest potential for country and regional economic growth.  \n \n12.  The road maps developed with the TA will provide a link with the countries\u2019 development \nplans, in particular with the objectives to invest in infrastructure to create capacity, and to \ndiversify exports. Diversification ranks high in the agenda of most countries in the Central and \nWest Asia region. Development entails shifting resources from the less productive activities of \nthe economy, typically agriculture, into industry and services. In this process, countries upgrade \nand  diversify  their  production  and  export  structures,  become  more  urbanized,  and  people \nmigrate from rural to urban areas.  \n \n13.  Road maps will play a key role in systematizing sector analyses and strategies that \ninform country partnership strategies, country operations business plans, project and program \nreports, and related results frameworks. Their preparation is an integral part of the sector and \nthematic work needed for country and project planning. They will facilitate better alignment with \nDMC plans and priorities and with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. They will also provide the basis for \nsector  division  and  resident  mission  dialogue  with  DMC  clients.  Road  maps  will  combine \nanalytical, strategic, and planning features. They will be updated as needed to reflect key sector \ndevelopments. They will also provide an analytical link to the \u201cdrivers of change\u201d identified in \n                                                 \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n ", "4  \nStrategy  2020:  private  sector  development,  good  governance,  knowledge  solutions,  and \npartnerships.  \n \n14.  The urban services road maps will be a tool that will contribute to generating a forward-\nlooking picture of what cities in the Central and West Asia region will look like. The DMCs in \nCentral and West Asia will be able to plan what services these cities will require, how to provide \nthem (at an affordable cost) and the necessary financial resources. The development of modern \ncities will be essential for the economic future of these countries. Five areas in particular appear \nto be relevant: (i) water supply and sanitation, (ii) solid waste management, (iii) urban transport, \n(iv) markets and logistics, and(v) municipal finance solutions that strengthen and reinforce \ndecentralization  in  the  provision  of  services.  Financial  sustainability  and  private  sector \nparticipation will be the two key themes in the urban services road maps. ADB\u2019s capacity in \nurban  infrastructure  development  should  catalyze  long-term,  public\u2013private  partnerships  in \nservice delivery, alongside strengthened governance and institutions for improved city and \nmunicipal management. Furthermore, private sector participation in ADB-led urban development \nprojects offers the best hope for large and sustained improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, \nand service quality of utility companies and, above all, promotes deep institutional reforms in the \nurban sector.  \n \n15.  The energy sector road maps will guide planning for investments in energy. To plan \ninvestments in energy, sound forecasts of demand and supply of different energy sources are \nrequired as well as scenarios based on, for example, the likely evolution of prices. Addressing \nthe role of renewable sources of energy in the context of growing awareness of climate change \nissues is also important and, given this propose, an optimal energy mix. Three key areas to be \naddressed by the energy road maps will be efficiency, security, and regional trade.  \n \n16.  Transportation road maps will suggest paths for system improvements. They will assess \nall  aspects  of  the  existing  transportation  systems,  identify  areas  with  significant  gaps  or \nopportunities for improvement, and target investments and other policies that build upon the \nexisting system strengths. To encourage the development of transportation road maps, the \ncriterion  by  which  transportation  markets  will  be  judged  to  be  efficient  will  be  competitive \neconomic efficiency. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the TA will be a series of mutually agreed-upon well-informed country \nstrategies  based  on  analytically  sound  sector  road  maps,  as  well  as  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  country  partnership  strategies,  regional  cooperation  strategies,  and \ndevelopment plans by participating governments and ADB. The outcome of the TA will be a \nframework and vision for modern and competitive transport, energy, and urban infrastructure \nand services in Central and West Asia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  Work under the TA will combine analytical, strategic, and policy dialogue, and support \nthe governments\u2019 development agendas. To this purpose, sector road maps will (i) have sound \nanalytical foundations, (ii) be based on quantitative analysis, (iii) provide a regional dimension, \nand (iv) be integrated with each other so that they provide a unified view.  \n ", "5 \n \n19.  TA  activities  will  include  (i)  collecting  and  collating  all  necessary  sector  data  and \ninformation to undertake supply and demand analyses, (ii) analyzing government sector master \nplans, (iii) developing simulations to build likely future scenarios, and (iv) providing financing \nplans for each sector and identifying areas of future ADB involvement. The TA will utilize a \ncollaborative  approach  and  rely  extensively  on  consultations  with  government  and \nnongovernment  stakeholders  to  gather  information  and  perspectives,  as  well  as  to  build \nconsensus on the future directions for each sector. Discussions and dissemination workshops \nwill be organized. These workshops will provide a venue to discuss methodology and outputs, \nas well as to seek synergies with client governments. The final road maps will be presented at \nthe ministers meeting for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation in 2012. Work will be \nled by experts in each sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The  estimated  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1,800,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  the \nequivalent  of  $1,500,000  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  governments  of  Kazakhstan  and \nUzbekistan will provide a total of $300,000 equivalent to support TA implementation in their \nrespective countries, through the provision of in-kind support in the form of logistical support, \ndata provision, and office accommodation. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA with the Country Coordination and Regional \nCooperation Division of CWRD (acting in close collaboration with CWRD sector divisions) being \nthe focal point. In collaboration with the sector divisions, the Country Coordination and Regional \nCooperation  Division  will  prepare  the  sector  terms  of  reference  and  coordinate  consultant \nrecruitment  and  technical  aspects  of  the  TA.  International  and  national  consultants  with \nexpertise in each of the three sectors (energy, urban services, and transport) and in project \ncoordination will implement the TA activities. Consultant selection will be through a firm using \nquality- and cost-based selection with an 80/20 weighting using a full technical proposal in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on The Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The TA will require 36 person-months of international consulting and 78 person-months of \nnational  consulting.  The  project  coordinator  (24  person-months)  will  be  engaged  on  an \nindividual basis. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. TA funds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented from January 2011 to December \n2012. The TA team will oversee the outputs of the TA activities, including comments on draft \npapers and coordination of missions to meet governments. The no-objection of participating \nCWRD countries will be confirmed in writing prior to the commencement or financing of TA \nactivities in those countries. \n \nIV.
