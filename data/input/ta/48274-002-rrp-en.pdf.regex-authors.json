THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Urban\u2013Rural Water Source Protection and \nEnvironmental Demonstration Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will be implemented in Zuoquan County, Jinzhong Municipality of \nShanxi Province. It will address key water resources management and related issues in Zuoquan \nCounty in an integrated manner, including flood mitigation, soil erosion prevention, land use \nplanning, water supply, wastewater treatment, and related capacity-building activities.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Rapid economic development in the PRC has led to severe ecological and environmental \ndegradation.  To  address  these  issues  while  continuing  to  eliminate  absolute  poverty,  the \nGovernment of the PRC has been promoting ecological civilization2 and has specified targets in \nits Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020.3 Water \nresources protection and flood risk mitigation are key elements of ecological civilization and \neffective means for poverty reduction. The government has identified Zuoquan County, a national-\nlevel poverty county in the water-scarce and heavily polluted Hai River basin, as an integral part \nof  the  ecological  belt  for  Shanxi  Province.  Assistance  to  Zuoquan  County  is  expected  to \ndemonstrate the ability and merits of working at the county level to advance the government\u2019s \ngoal of ecological civilization and poverty reduction. \n \n4.  Zuoquan County is in the Hai River basin, bordering Hebei Province on the east. It has a \npopulation of 165,042 (in 2015), 57% of which is rural. The county\u2019s mean annual precipitation is \n520 millimeters, with more than 70% of rainfall occurring from June to September; and its average \nannual evaporation is 1,620 millimeters. With 33% of its population being poor, Zuoquan County \nis designated a national-level poverty county. About 98% of Zuoquan County is in the Qingzhang \nwatershed. Originating in the county, the Qingzhang River flows into the Zhang River in Hebei \nProvince\u2014a tributary of the Hai River. The Qingzhang River, together with the Shixia and \nXiajiaozhang reservoirs, is a strategic water source for 1.92 million people in Shanxi Province. As \nan important source for the Hai River basin, the water quality of Qingzhang River also bears \nsignificantly on the water safety of 1.2 million people in downstream areas of Hebei and Henan \nprovinces. \n \n5.  Soil  erosion  and  sedimentation.  Located  on  the  Loess  Plateau,  Zuoquan  County \nexperiences serious soil erosion, with over 50% of its land eroded to some degree. The vegetation \ncoverage of the Qingzhang River\u2019s upstream catchment is generally good, but the vegetation \ncondition for areas near villages and towns and along the roads is poor. Heavy rain has caused \nsoil erosion from these areas with little or without coverage. Soil erosion also comes from non-\nprotected riverbanks. Sediment from soil erosion has resulted in the siltation of rivers, streams, \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Shanxi \nUrban\u2013Rural Water Source Protection and Environmental Demonstration Project (TA 8856-PRC). \n2  Ecological civilization refers to achieving harmony between growth, people, and nature. It includes activities to \nmitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between the \nenvironment and the economy. \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016. Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National Economic and Social \nDevelopment. Beijing. ", "2 \nand reservoirs. According to the record of the Zuoquan Shixia Reservoir Management Office from \n1990 to 2013, the total accumulated siltation volume during these 23 years was 345,000 cubic \nmeters (m3), with an average siltation volume of 15,000 m3 per year. Siltation of the reservoir \ncompromises its flood control function and reduces the water storage capacity. Soil erosion also \nimpairs other vital ecosystem services. Projected increases in storm intensities will likely increase \nthe risk of soil erosion. \n \n6.  Flood risks. Zuoquan County suffers from frequent floods because of lack of adequate \ninfrastructure. Riverine floods occur in most sections of the Qingzhang River at a flood frequency \nof one in 5 years. The main urban section contains a structural embankment whereas rural areas \nonly have isolated earth bunds. Bank protection for both sides of the river in the west district (a \nnew city district under development) is almost nonexistent\u2014a few earth bunds built from the \n1950s to the 1980s are in dilapidated conditions, and some have been washed down to the river, \ncausing severe blockages. Flood risks are heightened by the projected increase in climate-\ninduced storm intensities. A major flood in August 1996 caused huge losses, affecting about \n100,000 people in all 10 townships of Zuoquan County. About 9,000 houses were destroyed, and \nnearly 140,000 mu of cropland were damaged.4 The flood caused more than 30 deaths and \n550 injuries. Flooding not only poses a significant risk to people\u2019s lives, but is also a key \nrestraining factor of sustainable development in Zuoquan County. \n \n7.  Low quality and inadequate water supply. The separate planning process and different \nownership  structures  for  water  management  in  Zuoquan  County  have  resulted  in  serious \ndevelopment gaps in water supply facilities. Zuoquan County has functioning water supply \nfacilities for its 60,000 residents in the county\u2019s urban center. However, the water supply to rural \nresidents is lacking or of poor quality, without any treatment. The water supply pipes are also \naged and leaking. Further, though they have permits to withdraw water from the Shixia Reservoir, \nmost rural enterprises use groundwater without adequate infrastructure to access surface water, \nresulting in the depletion and unsustainable use of groundwater. These rural enterprises, which \nhire over 90% of local villagers, are an important income source for rural farmers. Inequitable and \nunsafe  water  supply  is  inconsistent  with  socially  inclusive  development,  and  hinders  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of urban\u2013rural integration. \n \n8.  Insufficient  wastewater  collection  and  treatment.  The  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment capacity in Zuoquan County cannot meet the demand of increasing urbanization. Like \nelsewhere in the PRC, urbanization has been a key driver of development and economic growth. \nHowever, continuous rapid urbanization puts significant pressure on scarce land and natural \nresources, and contributes to pollution for Zuoquan County. Some sewer networks are aged and \nleaking, causing pollution to the Qingzhang River. Key issues include (i) wastewater overflowing \nfrom some flow interceptors into the Qingzhang River, even in the dry season; (ii) the trunk sewer \nleaking directly into the Qingzhang River, as it is laid along the river; (iii) the Zuoquan County \nwastewater treatment plant facing frequent equipment breakdowns; and (iv) the capacities of \nwastewater collection and treatment being unable to meet current and future needs. \n \n9.  Lack of ecosystem-friendly infrastructure connecting urban center and new district. \nZuoquan County\u2019s urban development master plan expected the urban population to grow to \nabout 82,000 in 2020 and 113,000 in 2030.5 The urbanization rate is projected to increase to 62% \nin 2030. The existing Binhe Road, a trunk road connecting the urban center to the new district in \nperi-urban and rural areas, cannot satisfy current and increasing traffic demands. The east section \n                                                \n4  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n5  Zuoquan County Government. 2011. Zuoquan Urban Development Master Plan, 2011\u20132030. Zuoquan. \n ", "3 \nof the Binhe Road has reached its design capacity, while the west section of about 5 kilometers \n(km) is yet to be expanded to meet the demand. Moreover, the storm water pipe and the trunk \nsewer to the new district need to be installed concurrently along the Binhe Road\u2014as an integrated \napproach to improving water resources management together with road improvement\u2014which will \nbe cheaper than constructing them separately. The Binhe Road provides an opportunity to pilot \ntest the government\u2019s sponge city initiative, which will not only help slow down surface runoff but \nalso reduce nonpoint source pollution from urban runoff.6 The experience gained will be used for \nZuoquan County\u2019s new urban district development. \n \n10.  Weak  institutional  capacity.  Zuoquan  County\u2019s  water  resources  management  is \nfragmented, lacking a coordinated and integrated approach to land use planning, and urban and \nrural development. The urban and rural water supply systems are separate, with large gaps in \nwater  quality  and  service  reliability.  Zuoquan  County\u2019s  capacity  for  project  planning  and \nimplementation  is  weak  since  it  has  little  experience  with  international  organizations.  The \ncounterpart staff of the project do not have experience in implementing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) projects and are unfamiliar with ADB procedures and requirements. The current flood-\nwarning  system  is  inadequate,  and  cannot  provide  effective  and  timely  warnings  to  rural \ncommunities. \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on National \nEconomic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020 for integrated urban\u2013rural development and \necological civilization (footnote 3). It is also consistent with Zuoquan County\u2019s urban development \nmaster plan (footnote 5). The project conforms to the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020;7 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020 \nfor managing climate change and the environment, and supporting inclusive economic growth.8 \nIt also conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 to increase coverage and improve \nservices for water supply and sanitation, and promote integrated water resources management.9 \n \n12.  Lessons. The project design has incorporated lessons from good practices in integrated \nwater resources management financed by ADB and other international development agencies. \nMajor lessons include (i) an integrated management approach, incorporating cross-sector water \nresources management, urbanization, and environmental issues (including projected climate \nchange impacts); (ii) the inclusion of nonstructural measures and community participation in \naddition to structural interventions; (iii) coordinated management of urban\u2013rural planning, and \nmanagement of resources and services to facilitate integration and linkage to infrastructure; and \n(iv) provision of training to strengthen government agencies. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  quality  of  life  and  environmental \nsustainability in Zuoquan County improved (footnote 5).10 The project will have the following \n                                                \n6  The sponge city initiative is the government\u2019s policy to promote water conservation. A key principle is to minimize the \nimpact of urban development on the natural water cycle through green infrastructure such as preserved floodplains, \nstorm water wetlands, retention ponds, sunken parks, bio-retention swales, seepage wells, and green roofs. \n7  ADB. 2014.

Special features  and value  addition. The  project  is  expected  to  demonstrate  the \nfollowing innovations and/or value additions, which will be disseminated through knowledge \nproducts, water conferences, and exchange visits with similar river basins: \n(i)  Integrated water resources management at county level. The project supports \nstructural and nonstructural measures from upstream to downstream Qingzhang \nRiver, including climate-resilient flood risk management, ecological conservation \nand  rehabilitation,  water  demand  management,  and  institutional  reform.  This \napproach will have a good demonstration effect for other regions, as the PRC \nneeds to improve the management of its many small river basins. \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \n(ii)  Integrated urban\u2013rural land use planning and protection. The project area has \nbeen analyzed and classified into different zones according to their land use types. \nProtection measures have been identified according to the characteristics of each \nland  use  zone,  including  climate-sensitive  vegetation  for  upstream  Shixia \nReservoir to reduce soil erosion and adapt to anticipated increase in extreme \nweather events; improvement of the flood protection standard of the Qingzhang \nRiver; improvement of sewage collection and treatment; and provision of reliable \nand quality water supply to rural households and rural industry. \n(iii)  Application of sponge city design. Sponge city is an important concept for \nintegrated urban land and water management (footnote 6). Climate resilience \nplanning  and  design  practices  embedded  in  the  sponge  city  concept  are \ndemonstrated in the Binhe Road expansion. The scale will be extended to prepare \nan action plan to identify technologies and practices for Zuoquan County\u2019s new \nurban district development. \n(iv)  Inclusive urbanization and poverty reduction. Zuoquan, a national poverty \ncounty, is below average in social and economic development partly because of \ninadequate infrastructure. The project will create an enabling environment for the \ncounty\u2019s development and poverty reduction by providing improved infrastructure, \nflood  risk  reduction  measures,  water  supply,  and  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment system. \nD.

Water components \n(outputs 2 and 3) are at moderate risk from greater variability in precipitation, rising temperatures, \nand/or increased storm intensity. Ecosystems and natural resources components (output 1 and \npart of output 2) are rated high risk because of the strong likelihood of physiological stress from \nrising temperatures and increased probability of heatwaves in summer, leading to increased \nmortality rates, loss of biodiversity, and reduced productivity and provision of ecosystem services. \nThe overall design is geared toward climate resilience. Each project component incorporates \nadaptation measures, including raising embankment heights and increasing reservoir storage \ncapacity to cope with climate-induced flooding; adopting a mix of climate-resilient native species \nfor the revegetation and forest planting components; enhanced hydrological and water quality \nmonitoring; and capacity building on water resources management that is mindful of projected \nclimate risks. The project is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 640 tons per year. \nClimate mitigation is estimated to cost $3.25 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost \n$18.52 million.13 ADB will finance 93% of mitigation and adaptation costs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic analysis confirmed the economic viability of the project, with an economic \ninternal rate of return of 17.9%. The economic viability of the project was tested against different \nadverse  scenarios:  a  10%  investment  cost  overrun,  a  10%  increase in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance cost, a 10% reduction in benefits, and their combinations. The results showed that \nthe economic viability of the project is robust against any of the adverse scenarios. \n \n27.  The financial analysis assessed the financial sustainability of the project based on the \nfiscal impact of (i) counterpart funds during the project, (ii) operation and maintenance cost, and \n(iii) the loan repayment obligation. ZCG will be responsible for the entire financial obligations. \nDuring implementation, the total financial obligations represent up to 4.2% of the annual revenue \nof ZCG. After project implementation, ADB\u2019s loan repayment, financing charges, and recurrent \ncosts will be about 1.9% of the annual revenue of ZCG. The project is fiscal sustainable based on \nthe projected fiscal analysis of ZCG\u2019s revenues and expenditures, as well as a water sector \ncomponent analysis showing a financial internal rate of return exceeding the weighted average \ncost of capital. \n \n                                                \n13 Details on the estimates of climate risk adaptation and mitigation measures can be found in the Climate Risk \nVulnerability Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked document in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n28.  A financial management assessment was conducted for ZCG. The financial management \nrisk  of  the  project  is  moderate  because  of  ZCG\u2019s  unfamiliarity  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedures and requirements, or ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. The assessment \nrecommended an action plan, which ZCG will implement during the project, to mitigate the \nidentified financial management risks of unfamiliarity with ADB procedures and requirements, and \ndelays in providing adequate counterpart funds. \n \n29.  The procurement risk assessment indicated that (i) ZCG and the implementing agencies \nhave the experience to undertake procurement of consulting services, goods, and works; and \n(ii) monitoring and internal controls regarding procurement are generally in place, but ZCG and \nthe implementing agencies lack experience on foreign-funded projects. Mitigation measures will \ninclude (i) early engagement of a procurement agent and project implementation consultants, and \n(ii) the provision of training on ADB\u2019s procurement policies and procedures during implementation. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, SPG, JMG, and ZCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n31.  Poverty and social. A poverty and social assessment was conducted; and several \nmeasures are adopted in the project design for social inclusion and improving living standards of \nlocal residents, including (i) the project area covering rural villages for tree plantation, flood \nprotection  and  environmental  improvement,  and  water  supply;  (ii)  the  involvement  of  local \ncommunities in project design and implementation;  and (iii) targeted jobs for local people, \nespecially for the poor and the women. \n \n32.  A total of 98,627 people will directly benefit from the project. Among them, 58% are in rural \nvillages and townships, and 11% are below the national poverty line. The project will provide \nseveral opportunities for local beneficiaries, including (i) new job opportunities during construction \nand operation; (ii) improved living conditions through rural water supply, wastewater management, \nand reduced flood risks; (iii) economic opportunities boosted by better environmental and water \nsecurity; (iv) improved road and traffic safety; and (v) training and capacity building. \n \n33.  Consultations were undertaken with local communities during project preparation, and \ntheir  feedback  has  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Further  consultations  will  be \nundertaken during the detailed design and implementation, ensuring that local people participate \nin and benefit from relevant project activities. Community-based methods will be adopted to \nimplement  nonstructural  activities.  A  stakeholder  communication  strategy  is  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 12). \n \n34.  Gender. Most project benefits are expected to be distributed across men and women. \nSome components, such as the rural water supply and nonstructural activities, offer more \nopportunities for women and the poor to benefit. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming, and a gender action plan has been prepared. The gender and social development \naction plans comprise targeted measures for women and the poor, including (i) involving them in \nproject design and implementation, (ii) providing targeted employment for them, and (iii) training \nproject staff on gender and social inclusion measures. ZCG will implement and monitor these \nplans, and submit semiannual progress reports to ADB. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.14 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) report, including \nan environmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared and follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.15 The IEE and EMP are based on the approved domestic feasibility study report \nand environmental assessments, site visits, and stakeholder consultations, including with affected \npersons. The outcomes have been integrated in the project design. ZCG will be responsible for \nthe EMP implementation; and will appoint qualified environmental personnel to coordinate key \ntasks, including inspection, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions or measures. \nLoan implementation consultants and a capacity-building program were included in the project \ndesign. The IEE, including the EMP, was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2016. \n \n37.  The project is expected to achieve environmental benefits, including reduced flood risks, \nimproved security of drinking water supply for 43 villages, enhanced wastewater management, \nand revegetation in the upper west Qingzhang watershed. Anticipated construction impacts are \nfrom the dredging and embankment (i.e., temporary damage of in-channel habitats and elevated \nturbidity); and construction-related air, dust, noise, and erosion impacts. Operational risks include \ninadequate maintenance of project structures, noise emissions from increased road traffic, and \noverflow of untreated wastewater in waterways during peak floods. Mitigation measures are \ndescribed in the EMP; and include containment of dredged sediment, design of embankment \nhabitats, noise barriers, and improved storm water and wastewater management. The IEE \nconcludes that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed training, will result in \nresidual impacts within the limits of the PRC standards defined in the EMP. \n \n38.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  The  project  will  permanently  acquire \n1,049.65 mu of collective land in 33 villages and demolish 8,099.62 square meters of residential \nhousing,  involving  591  affected  households  with  1,384  affected  persons.  Among  these, \n24 households with 104 persons and four enterprises with 32 employees will be physically \ndisplaced or relocated. The project will temporarily occupy 231.00 mu of collective land during \nconstruction, and will lease 384.64 mu of village lands for planting trees. \n \n39.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, and related PRC laws and regulations. Resettlement impacts have been adequately \nassessed, which includes adequate compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation measures to \nmitigate social risks and restore the living standards of affected persons. The resettlement plan \nhas been disclosed in affected villages and was posted on ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2016. \nThe affected persons were consulted during the preparation of the resettlement plan and will be \nfurther consulted during the updating and implementing of the resettlement plan. ZCG will fully \nfinance the land acquisition and resettlement costs; and the ADB loan will finance the costs for \nconsultants for resettlement implementation support and external monitoring. ZCG and  the \nimplementing agencies have the capacity and experience to implement land acquisition and \nresettlement under domestic projects. The project will strengthen their capacity to implement the \nresettlement plan in line with ADB\u2019s requirements. ZCG will engage an external monitoring agency \nto monitor the resettlement implementation and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n                                                \n14  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n15 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) is available both in English and Chinese (http://www.adb.org/Documents/ \nPolicies/ Safeguards/Safeguard-Policy-Statement-June2009.pdf and http://www. adb.org/Documents/ Translations/ \nChinese/ Safeguard-Policy-Statement-cn.pdf). \n ", "10 \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not involve any distinct ethnic \nminority community in the project areas, so it does not trigger requirements on indigenous peoples \nunder ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16 The overall risk is assessed moderate. \nThe project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks, and the integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in land acquisition  Zuoquan County Government (ZCG) will make available and release \nand resettlement  funds for compensation in a timely manner under its fiscal budget; and \nthe project will provide (i) capacity building through loan consultants, and \n(ii) independent resettlement monitoring of compliance. \nShortage of counterpart  ZCG prioritizes the project in its budget process and assures it will \nfunds for project  provide funds in a timely manner from its cash balances, expected fiscal \nimplementation  transfers, and access to provincial government-issued bonds. A loan \ncovenant has been included to ensure availability of funds by ZCG and \nShanxi Provincial Government.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n42.  The government, SPG, JMG, and ZCG have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 12) and loan documents. \n \n43.
