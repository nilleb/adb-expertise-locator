The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) had requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in 2001 to assist the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in improving \nstatistics in the services sector. Accordingly, ADB agreed to include a provision for advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) in its 2002 Country Strategy Program (CSP).  \n \n2.  A Fact-Finding Mission visited Beijing from 9 to 13 September 2002 to discuss the \nnature,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  as  well  as  other  issues  relating  to  the \nproposed  TA.  During  the  visit,  the  Mission  had  extensive  discussions  with  the  concerned \nofficials of the various government agencies as well as with the representatives of international \nagencies that had supported the development of statistics in the PRC. After discussions and \nconsultations with the senior officials of NBS, and other government and international agencies, \nunderstanding  was  reached  on  the  objective,  scope,  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements of the proposed TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  During  the  last  several  years,  the  PRC  has  made  substantial  progress in  national \naccounting estimation, including the implementation of the 1993 Systems of National Accounts \n(SNA  1993).  Some  recent  milestones  are  the  introduction  of  estimates  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) by expenditure category, production of quarterly national accounts by industry, \nand review and revision of the GDP series. However, PRC statistics still suffer from a number of \nserious limitations, including those that are due to data coverage and methodological issues. \nNBS is aware of these limitations and  is fully committed to resolving them over time. Efforts \nhave been made to expand the coverage of the data sources and refine the methodologies. \n \n4.  In the PRC's statistical reporting system, data are collected at the village, city, county, \nand province levels. Aggregate data are then passed upward to NBS through the provincial \ngovernments. This practice reduces the ability of NBS to check the data and change methods, \nprecludes seasonal adjustments, restricts the possibilities for comparing different periods, and \ndelays the identification of turning points. The lack of separation of government and statistical \nfunctions at the local level gives some provinces the opportunity to misreport data so as to \nappear more progressive and profitable. Consequently, the perception among some foreign \ncommentators is that some numbers published by NBS could be overestimated. \n \n5.  Recent Government reforms have resulted in rapid expansion of the services sector \nactivities.  This  expansion  has  contributed  to  the  rapid  development  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) services including software, growth of financial and banking \nsector activities, expansion of the real estate sector in both urban and rural areas, rapid \nincrease of informal sector activities, expansion of environmental and tourism services, etc. \nGlobalization  has  also  had  a  direct  impact  on  trade  and  communications  services.  The \nexpansion and improvements in services will result in a higher economic share for the sector in \nterms of investments and output. Current official estimates of the output and value added of the \nservices  sector  do  not  reflect  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  services  industry  and  may  be  a \nsignificant underestimation. This underestimation, which is due to incomplete coverage and \nunderpricing of services such as housing, public schools, and public transportation, has been a \nmajor problem in estimating of GDP in the PRC. \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) in January 2003. ", "2 \n6.  Discussions of issues on services sector statistics differentiate two broad classes of \nservices.  Consumer  services  are  those  provided  to  individuals  and  households  for  final \nconsumption. Examples are haircuts, medical treatment, entertainment, and security. Producer \nservices are intermediate inputs that are embodied in the production of other goods and \nservices. Examples are those in advertising, marketing (wholesale and retail), transport of soft \ndrinks or motorcycles, etc. Some problems that arise in identifying and measuring the output of \nservices under the current statistical systems of the PRC are worth highlighting. First, the \nproduction-based  method  of  national  accounts  identifies  sectors  as  \"goods  producing\"  or \n\"services producing.\" However, a sizable part of value added that is attributed to the former \nsector consists of services. There is, therefore, a systematic undervaluation bias against the \nservices sector output. This is true, especially for sectors producing services. Second, it is often \ndifficult  to  distinguish  between  consumer  and  producer  services,  a  fact  that  adds  to  the \nundervaluation bias in measuring the latter. The output of \"services producing\" sectors may be \nboth for final consumption and an intermediate input into a production process. This is easy to \nsee for such subsectors as finance, insurance, transport, and real estate. It is also true of other \nservices-producing subsectors, such as restaurants and a wide range of services delivered by \nthe Government. \n \n7.  One International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) study,2 gives \nfour main reasons why the statistical system underestimates the size of the services sector in \nthe  PRC.  First,  the  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  traditionally  provided  \"cradle-to-grave\" \nservices to their employees, but began to shed the extended social services recently. Such a \ndegree of vertical integration between production and services naturally lowered the demand for \nexternal  services.  Second,  the  nominal  value  of  agriculture  and  industrial  output  is  often \noverestimated, resulting in an under-estimation of the share of services in the national economy. \nThe  gross  industrial  output  of  the  township  and  village  enterprises,  in  particular,  is \noverestimated despite the efforts of NBS to correct it. Third, agricultural and industrial output is \nrelatively underdeflated compared with the services output; the result is an upward bias in \nmeasuring  the  real  value  of  agricultural  and  industrial  output,  compounding  the  problems \ncreated by overestimation of their nominal values. Fourth, for a long time the statistical system \nignored services, using instead standard socialist-planned economy accounting methodologies \nadopted  from  the  Soviet  model.  NBS  has  corrected  some  of  the  statistical  biases  against \nservices by conducting the Census of the Tertiary Sector during 1993-1995, but much work is \nyet to be undertaken. \n \n8.  The census was the first extensive survey of the services sector in the PRC. It resulted \nin significant revisions to the value added in service activities and in GDP. But since then, there \nhas been no significant effort to collect information even for major services sector activities. The \ngrowing importance of the services industry in the PRC has raised the need to survey and \nmeasure  the  contribution  of  these  activities,  covering  the  tertiary  sectors  including \ntransportation, storage and communication, wholesale and retail trade, banks and nonbanks, \nreal  estate  and  ownership  of  one's  own  dwelling  account  (housing  services),  private  and \ngovernment  services  ICT  services,  including  e-commerce,  are  already  changing  the \ncharacteristics of trade, communication, business services, and other sectors. These services \nsector activities are undergoing structural changes that will have an impact on their share of the \nnational  income.  Statistical  measurements  in  the  services  industry  must  take  these  new \ndevelopments  into  account,  to  make  the  role  of  the  private  sector  more  transparent  and \neffective, and to facilitate good governance and monitoring of the economy. The statistical \n                                                 \n2 World Bank 2002. \"Understanding Services and Measuring the Size of China's Services Sector.\" Beijing. ", "    3 \nsystem of the PRC should develop new methods of measuring and collecting data to capture \nthe changes. \n \n9.  There are major problems in measuring informal sector activities. Most small businesses \nare not adequately covered in enterprise surveys. The emergence of private firms (i.e., private \nschools, private banking and nonbanking financial institutions, security companies, legal firms, \ninternet providers) has complicated the measurement issues. Although household surveys are \nconducted in both rural and urban areas, no information is collected from family-owned and -\noperated small businesses except farms. Thus, there are major data gaps in informal sector \nactivities. Sample surveys for small enterprises (eight or more workers) are conducted by the \nEnterprise Survey Organization and the Department of Trade and External Relations Statistics \non an ad hoc basis, but there is a whole range of small firms that have not been covered in \nsample  surveys  conducted  by  NBS.  NBS  should  improve  the  estimates  of  informal  sector \nactivities,  especially  those  relating  to  enterprises  employing  less  than  eight  persons  and \nhouseholds not covered by NBS sample surveys. \n \n10.  The  demand  for  better  statistics  in  the  services  sector  of  the  economy  has  been \nincreasing, particularly from the private sector. NBS has not been able to effectively meet that \ndemand and needs to strengthen its capability for improving the services sector statistics. \nStrengthening NBS will help improve the estimation of national accounts and bring that function \nin line with international standards. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA aims to strengthen the national account estimates of the PRC, with special \nemphasis on improving services sector statistics. To achieve this objective, the TA will support \nNBS to  (i) develop suitable methodologies for measuring output and value added of services, \nparticularly in sectors that are growing rapidly; (ii) implement these methodologies in a pilot \nsurvey; (iii) adapt the tested methodology in nationwide surveys; (iv) revise national accounts \nestimates on the basis of survey findings; and (v) upgrade the skills of the staff of the National \nAccounts Department (NAD) of NBS and provincial staff in collecting and compiling services \nsector statistics and in reviewing and revising national accounts estimates.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in coordination with all international agencies active in \nproviding assistance for improving statistical services in the PRC, especially the Organization \nfor Economic Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  World  Bank,  International  Monetary \nFund (IMF), Statistics Canada, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). Coordination will be necessary to \navoid duplication as well as to learn from each other's experiences. These agencies will also be \ninvited to attend the TA workshops and share their knowledge and experiences with various \nissues and methodologies relating to the measurement of statistics in the services sector. The \nGovernment will support the TA by giving priority to improving the technical capacity of the \nprovincial and local staff, and commercializing and publishing of the data through the NBS web \nsite. \n \n13.  The TA will comprise the following activities \n ", "4 \n(i)  Provide international and domestic consultants to help NBS identify data gaps \nand sources of data, develop methodologies, and prepare manuals/handbooks to \nhelp the NBS staff in collecting and compiling services sector statistics;  \n \n(ii)  Offer apprenticeship programs for NBS staff to learn from the experiences of \nstatistically more developed countries, preferably OECD member countries;  \n \n(iii)  Help  NBS  organize  a  short-term  training  program  in  services  statistics  for \nprovincial staff to enhance their technical skills;  \n \n(iv)  Provide necessary computers and related equipment for the National Accounts \nDepartment of NBS; and  \n \n(v)  Provide partial support to implement a survey on the services sector in one \nprovince on a pilot basis to test the methodologies developed during the project \nperiod, and help adapt this tested methodology nationwide on a regular basis.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, of which $280,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $470,000 is the local currency cost (Appendix 2). The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $450,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost, \nand $170,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost equivalent to $300,000, through the provision of counterpart \nsalary,  survey  operations,  accommodations,  office  space,  and  other  miscellaneous  local \nexpenses.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years beginning in July 2003 and will be completed \nin June 2006. NBS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Development  Indicators  and  Policy \nResearch Division (ERDI) of ADB will administer the TA. NBS will appoint the director general of \nNAD of NBS as project director who will be responsible for coordinating with ADB, for day-to-\nday project implementation, disbursement of funds, supervision of the work of consultants, and \nreviewing their reports. \n \n16.  The TA will finance the services of 9 person-months of international consultants (person-\nmonths in parenthesis): lead institutional sector consultant (4), corporate sector consultant (2.5) \nand non-corporate sector consultant (2.5); and domestic consultants for 21 person-months: \ngovernment services sector (5), financial corporate services sector (4), non-financial corporate \nservices (7), and household services sector (5). In addition, the TA will fund the participation of \nan expert from OECD in implementing activities, as and when needed as OECD has long \nexperience working with NBS in the area of national accounts and services sector statistics. The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  individually  according  to  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  NBS  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  and \nrequirements of ADB's advance payment facility.  \n ", "    5 \n18.  The TA will support both local and international training of NAD and provincial staff. Two \nNAD staff will participate in an apprenticeship program to the national statistical office of a \ndeveloped OECD country in the region for about 2 months to gain practical experience in \ncollecting and compiling of services sector statistics. The TA will also finance in-country training \ncourses for statistical staff of NBS and other line ministries, and provincial and local offices. The \nGovernment will provide the necessary staff and space for the training courses. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for Improving Services Sector Statistics, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nStrengthen the  Improved national  Review missions  Government budgetary \nnational accounting  accounts estimates,  Official communication  support and commitment \nsystem, with special  accurately reflecting  Reports and  to regular surveys \nemphasis on  the contribution of the  publications of National \nimprovement of  services sectors  Bureau of Statistics \nservices sector  (NBS), and NBS web \nstatistics  sites \n \nPurpose       \nDevelop NBS's  NBS, provincial, and  Review missions  Government commitment \ncapacity to improve  local staff well trained  Assessment of technical  to provide counterpart \nservices sector  in the concepts of  assistance (TA)  staff and adequate \nstatistics  and methodology for  progress by domestic  resources for undertaking \n  measuring the  and international  the surveys \ncontribution of the  consultants \nservices sector, and \nin conducting surveys \nOutputs       \nReliable and updated  High-quality  Review missions  Participation of subject \ndatabase on services  analytical report on  Participation in the  matter specialists from \nstatistics  all aspects of the   dissemination  NBS and other \n  services sector  workshops  Government agencies \n     \nProperly documented  Review of the published  Availability of highly \nsurvey data set, with  report by staff of Asian  qualified consultants, who \nfull documentation of  Development Bank  produce high-quality \nsurvey methodology  (ADB) and other  analytical reports \nagencies \nActivities       \nConduct pilot survey  High-quality data  Review missions  Availability of highly \n(questionnaire  collection materials  Review of materials by  qualified international staff \ndesign, survey  (questionnaires and  consultants and staff of   \ndesign, data entry,  instruction manuals),  Development Indicators   \ntabulation plan, data  published data sets  and Policy Research    \nanalysis and report)  and analytical report  Division (ERDI)   \n       \nOn-the-job training in  NBS, provincial, and  Review missions  Nomination of staff by \nservices statistics  local staff trained  Consultants' reports  NBS \n    Assessment by trainees   \n       \nInception and  A large number of  Review of workshop  Active participation of \nconcluding  attendees from NBS,  papers and workshop  NBS staff \nworkshops  provincial, and local  proceedings and   ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n  offices as well as  documents   \n  international     \n  agencies     \n       \nApprenticeship  5 NBS National  Review mission   Availability of senior \nprogram for NBS  Accounts Division  Official communication  government staff and \nofficials  staff participating in  Assessment by trainees  willingness of the host \n  the program  institution \nInputs       \nInternational  Detailed instruction  Consultants' reports  Availability of highly \nconsultants \u2013 9  manuals for  Review mission  qualified consultants \nperson-months  collecting data from  Assessment of manuals  Implementation of TA \n(institutional sector,  institutional services  and analytical reports by  properly coordinated with \ncorporate sector, and  sector, corporate  ADB  other regular activities of \nnoncorporate sector)  services sector, and    NBS, and availability of \nDomestic consultants  noncorporate    key staff at all stages of \n\u2013 21 person-months  services sector;    technical assistance \n(institutional sector,  sampling     \nnoncorporate sector,  methodology,     \nand household  questionnaire as well     \nservices sector)  as training manuals     \n       \nComputer equipment  Procurement of some  Review missions  None \nand software  15 high-power  Official communication \ncomputers, 5 laser \nprinters, and \nacquisition of some \nrelevant softwares for \nprocessing and \nanalyzing data \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
