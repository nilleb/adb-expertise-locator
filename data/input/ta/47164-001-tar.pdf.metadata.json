INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  importance  of  capacity  building  for  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPPs)  was \nconfirmed during the interministerial workshop on enabling PPPs in Cambodia, held on 6 June \n2013, and was agreed to in a memorandum of understanding of an ongoing TA on PPP.1 The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Cambodia Resident Mission conducted a fact-finding mission \nin September 2013 for the capacity development technical assistance (TA) for PPPs. During the \nmission,  the  Government  of  Cambodia    emphasized  that  the  TA  is  fundamental  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall PPP activities and is required to develop institutional capacity of the \ngovernment contracting agencies (GCAs) as they engage in PPP projects. The government and \nthe  resident  mission  discussed  and  agreed  on  the  objective,  scope,  main  components, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements for the proposed TA, which is \ndesigned to provide capacity development support to the GCAs involved in the preparation, \ntransaction, and management of PPP contracts. The proposed TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132013 which was extended to 2014 and ADB\u2019s mid-term review of \nStrategy 2020 to expand private sector support to 50% of annual operations by 2020. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Cambodia faces substantial challenges in providing new and improved infrastructure for \nits growing economy. Rapid urbanization and increasing connectivity with neighboring countries \nare driving demands for new and improved infrastructure and related services. The unmet \ndemand is reducing the country\u2019s competitiveness and ability to achieve high levels of economic \ngrowth,  reduce  poverty,  and  meet  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets.  Weaknesses  in \ninfrastructure, particularly in areas such as electricity3 and transport logistics, are consistently \ncited by businesses as principal constraints to private investment and productivity growth in \nCambodia.4 Total investment in infrastructure in Cambodia is estimated to range from $12 billion \nto  $16  billion  from  2013  to  2022,  although  the  actual  figure  might  be  much  higher  given \nestimated investment needs in these sectors. Infrastructure investment is state led, and the \npublic sector capital investment rate as a percentage of gross domestic product averaged 7.5% \nfrom 2004 to 2013. PPPs can help the government meet a financing gap by stimulating private \nsector investment and financing for infrastructure. PPPs provide a means to increase efficiency, \ngain access to new expertise and technology and improve service delivery to users, reducing \nannual costs of infrastructure for the government, and freeing up fiscal space. \n3.  The government has been taking steps to improve the investment climate and levels of \ninvestment in infrastructure, which are defined in comprehensive sector development plans. \nThese  plans  are  coordinated  under  the  overarching  development  program  defined  in  the \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Support for Public\u2013Private Partnerships in \nCambodia. Manila (TA 8013-CAM, $225,000, approved on 16 December). The TA aims to assess the current \nregulatory framework for private sector participation along with the gaps to be addressed to enable a conducive \nenvironment for PPP operations in Cambodia.   \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 February 2014. \n3 According to the Electricity Authority of Cambodia, electricity supply in Cambodia totaled 598 megawatts at the end \nof 2013 compared with peak demand at 646 megawatts. \n4 Under the National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018, transport sector and energy sector investments using \nboth public and private resources were planned at $910.4 million (12% of the plan\u2019s budget) and $303.5 million \n(4% of the plan\u2019s budget). \n ", "2  \nRectangular  Strategy.5 Since  2011,  with  assistance  from  ADB,  the  government  has  been \nundertaking a set of activities to strengthen the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for \nPPPs in Cambodia. Implementation of PPP activities has been constrained by low institutional \ncapacity in areas such as preparing, evaluating, transacting, and managing projects suitable for \nprivate investment, and limited borrowing capacity. Creating greater awareness of PPPs and \ntheir potential would allow the government to address these issues and help reduce the need for \npublic debt, leverage limited public revenues, and bring in private sector skills and finance.  \n4.  The government defines a PPP as a contractual agreement between a GCA and a \nprivate entity whereby (i) the private entity provides in full or in part a public infrastructure and/or \nservice; (ii) the needed infrastructure or services are defined on an output basis, allowing the \nprivate entity to define the best manner of provision; (iii) substantial and appropriate risks \nrelated to the provision of the infrastructure or services are transferred to the private entity; (iv) \nincome to be derived by the private entity related to the infrastructure or service is directly or \nindirectly dependent on the performance of the private entity; (v) the contractual agreement and \nassociated risk transfers and performance-based payment requirements extend over the project \nlife cycle, or a substantial time period (i.e., more than 1 year); (vi) the GCA plays a significant \nrole as either the purchaser of the infrastructure or service from the private entity, or as the \nenabler and regulator; and (vii) direct or indirect competition is utilized in the appointment of the \nprivate entity. \n5.  To date, the government has lacked the institutional capacity to identify and develop \nbankable PPP projects and ensure they are managed in accordance with contractual terms. As \na result, the development of the government\u2019s technical and management capacity is a clear \nprerequisite  for  an  effective  PPP  program  in  Cambodia.  In  discussions  by  ADB  with \nrepresentatives of the Council for the Development of Cambodia, Ministry of Economy and \nFinance, and line ministries such as the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy and Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport, it was apparent there is great interest in capacity development \nassistance in the areas of structuring, transacting, and managing PPPs.6 All of these agencies \nare engaged in the evaluation of bids for PPPs, which are primarily being developed by the \nprivate sector on an unsolicited basis due to a lack of resources within GCAs to proactively \nprepare projects. These agencies\u2014in particular the line ministries\u2014indicated they had identified \nprojects  in  their  sector  development  plans  that  might  be  suitable  for  development  by  the \ngovernment as PPP projects. \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  In line with ADB\u2019s commitment to advancing PPPs in Cambodia, and as an effort to \nimprove the PPP institutional capacity, the TA will build the capacity of senior and mid-career \nofficials of the government to develop and manage PPP projects through well-designed and \ntargeted capacity-building activities in areas with potential for enhanced PPP initiatives. It also \naims at creating awareness on international best practices in developing PPPs among the \ngovernment\u2019s officials and other PPP stakeholders, which will help constitute a critical mass for \nPPP support. \n7.  The TA will assist the government to boost the levels of sector investment through \nbuilding  technical  and  management  capacity  of  relevant  institutions  to  identify,  prepare, \n                                                \n5 The Rectangular Strategy, Phase III for the fifth legislature (2013\u20132018), places greater emphasis on human capital \ndevelopment  through  increasing  infrastructure  investments,  encouraging  private  sector  investment,  and \nstrengthening capacity of public institutions, among others. \n6 Under the new government (2013\u20132018), the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy was separated into two \nministries, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts.  \n ", "  3\nimplement, and monitor PPP projects. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132013 calls for \nPPPs to be \u201cactively sought in all areas of operations\u201d in Cambodia. Under the strategy, ADB \nundertook a PPP assessment in 2011 to identify the potential for PPPs in Cambodia.  \n8.  ADB is currently implementing Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for \nSupport for Public-Private Partnerships in Cambodia (footnote 1), which assists the government \nto (i) review existing policies, laws, regulations, and institutional arrangements for PPPs; and (ii) \ndevelop a strategic framework for PPPs through a policy paper on enabling PPPs in Cambodia \nand proposed changes to the law on concessions required to make the PPP process effective. \nAn  approved  project  preparatory  TA  for  the  PPP  development  project,  which  is  to  be \nimplemented, will identify viable projects expected to facilitate PPPs and enable greater private \nsector investment in infrastructure in Cambodia.7 This TA on capacity development for PPPs will \nfocus on building staff capacity of selected GCAs in developing and managing PPPs through \ntraining sessions and specific hands-on work, including preparation of case studies or outline \nbusiness cases. The TA will complement the ongoing TA activities and fit into a sequenced, \ncomprehensive PPP roadmap designed to progress the PPP landscape through the four pillars \nin ADB\u2019s PPP Operational Framework.8  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be trained GCAs able to apply the capacity and PPP guidelines. \nThe outcome will be an improved standard of GCA staff\u2019s capacity to develop infrastructure PPP \nprojects  under  various  forms  of  government  support.  The  staff  capacity  improvement  will \nsupport  the  government\u2019s  objective  of  increasing  the  number  and  value  of  commercially \nattractive and sustainable PPP projects offered by GCAs to the private sector. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Technical assistance preparation. The TA consultants will review PPP projects in \nCambodia and liaise with PPP-related stakeholders such as GCAs, private sector investors, and \nlegal firms to identify a list of existing PPP projects. The TA will target the priority subsectors \nsuch as transport, power, and other infrastructure services, and select two existing projects for \ncase studies. The consultants will apply the following list of criteria to select the two projects: (i) \nthe extent that the PPP project facilitates policy and institutional reform, (ii) whether it reflects \nthe  government\u2019s  planning  requirements,  (iii)  GCA  commitment  and  readiness,  (iv)  project \nreplication potential, and (v) potential for catalyzing private sector interest and commercial \nfinancing. The consultants will then prepare an implementation plan to develop institutional \ncapacity within the selected GCAs and submit the findings in an inception report.   \n11.  Key TA outputs are:   \n(i)  GCA staff trained in identifying, preparing, evaluating, transacting, and managing \nviable PPP projects;  \n(ii)  outline business cases (including a simple financial model) on PPP structures \nand implementation processes developed; and  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Public\u2013Private Partnership \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 8317-CAM, $900,000, approved on 19 December). The ensuing PPP loan is \nprogrammed for 2017.  The TA will develop (i) proposals for strengthening the enabling environment for PPPs, with \nparticular reference to the development of the PPP Unit, Risk Management Unit, Project Development Facility, and \nViability Gap Fund; (ii) a method to identify viable PPP projects; and (iii) a framework for preparing, transacting, \nand managing PPP projects. \n8 The four pillars are advocacy and capacity development, enabling environment, project development, and project \nfinancing. \n ", "4  \n(iii)  a critical mass for PPP support established. \n12.  Output 1: Government contracting agency staff trained in identifying, preparing, \nevaluating, transacting, and managing viable PPP projects. The consultants will work with \nselected GCAs  to  develop good governance  institutional  structures for  project  preparation, \nimplementation, and management. The consultants will (i) help the selected GCAs identify and \nselect relevant staff responsible for PPP activities (including the design, preparation, transaction, \nand management of the PPP projects); (ii) examine their capacity-building needs; and (iii) \nprovide training in project preparation and contract management. The arrangements will be \ndetailed in an institutional capacity-building report. \n13.  Output 2: Outline business cases (including a simple financial model) on public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  structures  and  implementation  processes  developed.  The  TA \nconsultants will use the two PPP projects selected for case studies (paragraph 10) to work with \nthe GCAs\u2019 project preparation team. The consultants will assist the GCA staff to develop best \npractice PPP structures and implementation processes as outline business cases that address \nthe following three interlinked activities of PPP projects: \n(i)  Technical analysis. This involves (a) the assessment of project rationale, (b) \nmarket analysis, (c) output specification, (d) viability and validity of feasibility \nand/or prefeasibility reports, (e) estimates of project costs and benefits, (f) site \nenablement analysis, (g) social and environmental safeguards assessments, (h) \nlegal  review  of  assets  and  functions,  (i)  procurement  strategy,  (j)  economic \nanalysis, and (k) stakeholder review to confirm project attractiveness.9 \n(ii)  Procurement analysis. This includes (a) the development of a financial model; \n(b) assessment of procurement and financial options based on criteria of value \nfor  money,  bankability,  and  affordability;  (c)  determination  of  the  adequate \nrevenues structure; (d) government support analysis, including form of support; \n(e) viability gap fund sizing, if required; and (f) identification of a proposed risk \nallocation structure. Market sounding should be initiated to confirm the project\u2019s \nfinancial  parameters  and  evaluate  legal  and  institutional  requirements  to \nestablish a proposed PPP structure.  \n(iii)  Project  implementation  requirements. These involve the development of a \nproject preparation plan to address site enablement issues and confirmation of \nthe government\u2019s willingness and capacity to provide support to the projects. \nThese  also  involve  preparations  of  (a)  bid  documents  (request  for  pre-\nqualification and request for proposal) and draft contractual terms; (b) project \npre-bid consultations; (c) bidder prequalification and bid evaluation criteria; (d) \ndetailed  output  specification,  performance  indicators,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation  frameworks;  (e)  required  due  diligence  documents;  (f)  assistance \nrequired  for  the  procurement  and  bid  process,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract \nnegotiation; (g) terms of reference for transaction advisors; and (h) institutional \nrequirements within GCAs to implement the transaction and manage the PPP \ncontract. \n \n14.  Output 3: A critical mass for public\u2013private partnership support established. The \noutline business cases and supporting materials will provide the GCAs with manuals for PPP \nidentification,  transaction,  and management  along  with  a  set  of  project  evaluation tools, a \nmethodology, checklists, and an implementation process that will allow them to develop PPP \n                                                \n9 A site enablement analysis will also look into any potential issues related to land acquisition, as this could be a \nmajor cause of PPP delays. These issues include the ability of the government to (i) provide land free of any \nencumbrances and (ii) fund land acquisition in advance of project inception. \n ", "  5\ncapacity within the respective GCAs. The need for guidelines for bidder selection (including how \nto deal with unsolicited bids) and the need for clarity and transparency in procurement are \nespecially  important.  The  materials  will  be  disseminated  to  GCA  staff  and  other  PPP \nstakeholders through a series of workshops establishing a critical mass for PPP support and \nawareness.  These  documents  will  be  prepared  according  to  international  best  practice \nstandards that can be adapted to suit the requirements of the government and the stage of \ndevelopment of the PPPs in Cambodia. \n15.  The design of the TA is based on the assumptions that (i) the government continues its \ncommitment to PPP activities and improving the enabling environment for PPPs, (ii) sustained \nfiscal resources are available for project support, and (iii) trained GCA staff are retained and \nremain responsible for their PPP work following capacity development. Critical risks include (i) \nlack of political will to promote and invite private sector participation through PPPs; (ii) slow \neconomic growth, which affects business confidence and private sector interest in PPP; and (iii) \nreduced buy-in by GCAs in PPPs during the TA implementation. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, furniture, logistical and \nadministrative assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be the executing agency.  \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2016. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB through a firm in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The firm will be led by an \ninternational team leader and PPP financial and commercial specialist, and comprise a technical \n(engineering) specialist, an economist, an environmental and social safeguard specialist, and a \nlegal and procurement specialist. National consultants will be recruited to provide support to the \ninternational experts. The firm will be selected by the quality- and cost-based selection method \nusing the simplified technical proposal with a 90:10 technical\u2013financial ratio, as technical factors \nare critical under the TA. Consultants\u2019 qualifications and person-months required are provided in \nAppendix  3.  The  procurement  and  disbursement  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Development for Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance Targets  Data Sources   Assumptions  \nSummary  and Indicators with  and Reporting  and Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact  By 2019:    Assumption \nTrained GCAs able to  At minimum two PPP  Review reports and  The government is \napply the capacity  projects formulated or bid  statistics from the  committed to PPP \nand PPP guidelines   out by trained GCAs  government agencies, in  activities and improving \n  particular the Ministry of  the enabling \nAt least one new PPP  Economy and Finance  environment for PPPs \nproject transacted by  and selected GCAs \nRisk \ntrained GCAs  \nLack of political will to \npromote and invite \nprivate sector \nparticipation through \nPPPs \nOutcome  By 2016:    Assumption \nImproved standard of  Core PPP staff capacity  Annual PPP and/or  Sustained fiscal \nGCA staff\u2019s capacity  raised in three to five  budget reports of the  resources for project \nto develop  GCAs by TA completion   government agencies   development support \ninfrastructure PPP  (none in 2013)   \nprojects under various    Risk \nforms of government  At least 70% of trained  Slow economic growth \nsupport  staff involved in PPP  affects business \ninfrastructure project  confidence and private \ndevelopment by TA  sector interest in PPP \ncompletion \n(none in 2013) \n \nOutputs  By 2016:    Assumption \n1.
