THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Sustained Private Sector-Led Growth Reform Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Fiji for subprogram 1 of the Sustained Private \nSector-Led Growth Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program, the first policy-based operation for Fiji, will assist the Government \nof Fiji to rebalance the economy from its present focus on public investment toward greater private \ninvestment and private sector participation by accelerating structural reforms over the medium \nterm. It builds on ongoing technical assistance (TA) projects from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners, and supports the government\u2019s efforts to promote private \nsector-led economic growth through improvements in fiscal management, in particular public \nfinancial management (PFM); the policy, legal, and institutional framework for state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); and the business and investment \nclimate.2 The programmatic approach, with three subprograms in 2018, 2019, and 2020, will allow \nchronological sequencing of complex and politically sensitive reforms. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Development context. Fiji is a small Pacific island nation with a population of about \n885,000 people. It has a total land area of 18,273 square kilometers covering 332 islands, of \nwhich  only  110  are  inhabited.  Major  markets  such  as  New  Zealand  and  Australia  are                \n2,000\u20133,000 kilometers away. Like other Pacific islands, Fiji is vulnerable to disasters triggered \nby natural hazards, including cyclones and floods. These constraints have contributed to low and \nvolatile real growth in gross domestic product (GDP), averaging 2.9% during 1970\u20132015. \n \n4.  Recent economic performance. Economic growth has picked up, averaging about 3.5% \nper year during 2010\u20132015. This is more than two times the annual growth during 2000\u20132009. \nEconomic revival since 2010 has been supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, \nincluding tax cuts, low interest rates, and increased public investment. Capital expenditure, for \nexample, increased from 5.6% of GDP in 2010 to 9.7% of GDP in 2015, and spending on social \nservices and social protection programs also went up.  Growth fell to 0.4% in 2016 when Tropical \nCyclone  Winston  resulted  in  estimated  losses  of  29.2%  of  GDP.  Following  post-cyclone \nreconstruction efforts and large public infrastructure investments, the government estimated the \ngrowth to have recovered to 3.9% in 2017. In addition, revenue measures to eliminate dividend \ntaxes and raise the minimum income tax threshold have had a positive impact on investment, \nconsumption, and value-added tax receipts. The growth forecast of 3.6% in 2018 is based on \nexpectations of continued fiscal expansion to support reconstruction. \n \n5.  Fiji\u2019s small size, remoteness, and susceptibility to natural disasters has led to a high-cost \nbusiness environment that discourages the private sector, particularly those outside the tourism \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

The profitability of Fiji\u2019s SOEs has also increased since 2010, but SOE \nproductivity remains low, with Fiji\u2019s 18 SOEs contributing only 4.0% to GDP in 2014 while \ncontrolling an estimated 12%\u201317% of total fixed assets in the economy.5 Opening this space to \nthe private sector offers considerable potential gains. \n \n6.  Fiscal situation. Reliance on the public sector to drive growth has led to the net fiscal \ndeficit averaging about 2.4% of GDP from FY2010 to FY2017 (Table 1). In FY2018, public \nexpenditure is estimated at 35.3% of GDP, with a net fiscal deficit of 3.5% financed by external \nand domestic borrowings and asset sales.6 While the government has room to take on additional \nborrowing, public debt (estimated at 45.5% of GDP in FY2017) is close to the government\u2019s ceiling \nof 50% of GDP and the government recognizes the need for fiscal room in the event of external \nshocks such as natural disasters. With projected deficits of 3.0% of GDP in FY2019 and FY2020, \ndebt is expected to reach 47.9% in FY2020. Domestic financing of the deficit will crowd out private \ninvestments. Given the limited fiscal space, and the need to build fiscal buffers to ensure adequate \nresources for disaster response, the government needs to manage fiscal consolidation carefully \nagainst its impact on public investment levels and economic growth.  \n \nTable 1: Selected Economic and Fiscal Indicators \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \nItem  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  FY2018p  FY2019p  FY2020p \nReal GDP Growth   5.6  3.8  0.4  3.9  3.6  3.3  2.9 \n(% change)   \nChange in CPI   0.5  1.4  3.9  3.3  3.0  3.0  3.0 \n(% change, end period) \n               \nCentral Government               \nBudget \nTotal revenue  27.2  26.0  27.9  27.7  31.8  29.5  28.4 \nTotal expenditure  31.6  29.8  33.4  29.1  35.3  32.5  31.4 \nOperating Balance  9.8  8.8  10.2  10.7  12.3  11.7  11.7 \nAsset Sales  0.2  0.1  2.0  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nNet Fiscal Deficit  (4.2)  (3.8)  (3.5)  (2.2)  (3.5)  (3.0)  (3.0) \n               \nPublic Debt  49.4  48.2  48.4  45.5  47.5  47.6  47.9 \nExternal debt  15.9  15.0  12.9  14.0  13.9  13.9  14.0 \n               \nNominal GDP ($ million)  4,463  4,386  4,682  4,942  5,269  5,602  5,930 \n( ) = negative, CPI = consumer price index, FY = financial year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = projection \nSource: Government of Fiji and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Macroeconomic challenges. The key macroeconomic challenge Fiji faces is to increase \nprivate  investment  and  reduce  reliance  on  public  investment  to  drive  economic  growth. \nAddressing this challenge will enable faster and more broad-based growth, while ensuring the \ngovernment has sufficient fiscal room to respond to shocks with fewer debt-financed public \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2015.

The planned fiscal deficit in FY2017 was equivalent to 4.7% of GDP when the actual deficit was 2.2%. \n \n ", "3 \n \ninvestments. The government acknowledges that it needs more private investment to meet its \nlong-term growth target of 5%, which is estimated to require an investment\u2013GDP ratio of 25%.7 \nIn 2018, the International Monetary Fund advised the government that sustaining high growth will \nrequire continuity in structural reforms that lower the cost of doing business and improve the \noverall business climate.8 \n \n8.  Past ADB engagement. ADB\u2019s past engagement in public sector management and \nprivate sector development has been mainly through regional TA facilities that have provided \nsupport for PFM, SOE reform, and business climate reform.9 Lessons from a review of ADB\u2019s \nengagement in these areas during 2006\u20132013 include (i) identifying champions to strengthen \nreform commitment and lead implementation, particularly for SOE reform and divestment; (ii) \nobtaining endorsement so that reforms are not derailed if the leadership changes; (iii) pursuing \nmoderate, stepwise reforms in sequence, especially where institutional capacity is limited; and \n(iv) providing sufficient time to develop capacity and institutionalize reforms. 10 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n9.  Government strategy. The government\u2019s National Development Plan, 2017\u20132036 (NDP) \nsets out a vision for inclusive socio-economic development through a strategy to become a \nregional hub of the South Pacific for business, transport, communications, and other services; \nand sets out a goal of a four-fold increase per capita income by 2036.11 To achieve this goal, the \ngovernment recognizes the need for greater private investment and participation by accelerating \nstructural reforms over the medium term. \n \n10.  Structural reform program. Since 2007, the government has introduced a number of \nsubstantive and progressive structural reforms with the objective of improving the business \nenvironment and opportunities for private sector-driven growth. Areas of focus have included \ntaxation, telecommunications market liberalization, introducing competition to the land lease \nprocess,  and  strengthening  infrastructure  services.  With  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners, the government is accelerating its efforts to increase private investment. \nReform areas in the NDP prioritized for implementation are (i) fiscal management, in particular \nPFM; (ii) the policy, legal, and institutional framework for SOEs and PPPs; and (iii) the business \nand investment climate.12 The NDP, the product of consultations with private sector associations \nand civil society groups, provides the basis for policy dialogue and TA coordination between the \ngovernment, ADB, and other development partners such as the World Bank, the Government of \nAustralia, and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC).  \n \n11.  Assistance modality. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \nseries with three subprograms (in 2018, 2019, and 2020) to support the implementation of the \nNDP. The government, ADB, and the World Bank have agreed to substantive policy actions that \nrequire sufficient time for preparation and constituency building to garner political support. The \nsequencing of reforms over three subprograms will accommodate the need for deficit financing \nfor FY2018 and match further program financing to anticipated budget needs, while allowing time \nfor effective and sustained implementation. A programmatic approach allows for prioritization \n                                                \n7  Macroeconomic Analysis: Summary (accessible from the list of supplementary documents in Appendix 2).   \n8  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

Alignment. The program will help the government achieve its objective of inclusive \nsocioeconomic development (para. 9). It fully aligns with the government\u2019s policy priorities set out \nin the national budget documents and the NDP. The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach, 2016\u20132019 and its focus on reducing the costs of doing business, managing risks from \nnatural and economic shocks, and enabling value creation by supporting private sector growth.13  \n \n13.  Policy  actions.  The  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  structural  reform  agenda \nunderpins the provision of policy-based lending from ADB and the World Bank.14 Under subprogram \n1, ADB supports 14 policy actions across three reform areas contained in the program policy \nmatrix and described in paras. 14-19. The government has completed all 14 actions. Additionally, \n21 indicative triggers are shown for subprogram 2 and 17 for subprogram 3, which will be refined \nbased on government priorities and capacity in the coming years. Subprogram 1 actions provide \nthe policy direction for subsequent reform implementation in subprograms 2 and 3, ensuring that \nthe formal policy underpinnings required are provided and that reforms are credible, consistent, \nand predictable.  \n \n14.  Fiscal management. The government recognizes that achieving a sound fiscal position \nrequires sound PFM systems and processes that promote fiscal discipline, strategic allocation of \nresources, and efficient service delivery. Sound PFM provides the private sector with policy \ncertainty and business confidence, particularly regarding public procurement and public sector \ncontracts. The policy actions supported under subprogram 1 include:  \n(i)  Public financial management framework. The cabinet has approved a Public \nFinancial Management Improvement Programme (PFMIP), 2016\u20132019 to address \nweaknesses  identified  through  a  2013  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability assessment. The PFMIP, which includes sequenced and prioritized \nactions to improve PFM systems and processes, will allow greater coordination \nwithin the government, and with development partners and technical agencies.15 A \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment, planned for 2018, \nwill provide the basis for measuring reform progress. \n(ii)  Budget transparency and accountability. The government disclosed to the \npublic budget kits that highlight FY2018 expenditure programs by sector and \nministry  to raise  awareness. The  Ministry  of Economy  (MOE)  has  published \nquarterly budget in-year reports on its website to improve monitoring of policy and \nproject implementation. This information is important for private firms that engage \nwith the government regularly through the supply of goods and services. Audited \nfinancial statements for the whole-of-government, that is, Government ministries, \nagencies and departments, were brought up to date following the change in fiscal \nyear, and these, together with the annual appropriation statement, have been \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n14  The NDP forms the basis for reforms contained in the program policy matrix (Appendix 4). The World Bank policy \nmatrix for its parallel program contains five prior actions, of which two are shared. These two actions cover \nparliamentary approval of the International Arbitration Act, 2017 and the Regulation of Building Permits Act, 2017. \n15  The government, through the PFMIP, acknowledges that a strong PFM system is vital to macroeconomic stability. \nThe PFMIP outlines a time-bound action plan to implement critical and ambitious PFM reforms. Recent PFM \nimprovements include (i) the introduction of pay-as-you-earn as a final tax and value-added tax self-assessment; \n(ii) the inclusion of performance management in budget documents at the program and activity level and tracking \nof the implications of new policy decisions; and (iii) the submission of annual procurement plans and their publication \non the Ministry of Economy (MOE) website. \n \n ", "5 \n \npublished on the website of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.16 Work has \ncommenced to assess the ability of the  MOE to formulate and implement a \nmedium-term expenditure framework, which will highlight the government\u2019s public \ninvestment priorities and provide private firms with clear indication of opportunities \nfor future public sector contracts. The Civil Service Reform Management Unit17 has \nprepared a planning framework for the government that allows devolution of a \nrange of functions from central agencies to line ministries, to better align their \nservice delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements. Reform progress \nwill be measured through Fiji\u2019s participation in the biennial Open Budget Survey.18 \n(iii)  Debt management. The government is implementing a rolling debt management \nstrategy and adjusting it as appropriate to the government\u2019s annual financing needs \nwhile minimizing financing costs. Sound risk management strategies that the \ngovernment is implementing include maintaining low and stable debt servicing \ncosts bearing in mind risks associated with foreign exchange fluctuations, and \nmaintaining a stable and affordable debt maturity structure to reduce the burden of \nresettlement  and  minimize  exposure.  The  strategy  is  a  key  piece  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  debt  policy,  which  focuses  on  achieving  debt \nsustainability by reducing fiscal deficits and adopting sound risk management \nstrategies (footnote 4). The strategy is also an important tool for private firms that \nsupply government agencies with goods and services. \n(iv)  Financial management. To improve the integrity of its payments system, and \nmake transactions smoother and more efficient, including for private businesses \nthat supply the government with goods and services, the government has joined \nthe United Nations Better Than Cash Alliance and has committed to increased \ndigitization and use of electronic payments.19  \n \n15.  Subprograms 2 and 3 will build on these reforms through cabinet approval of a revised \nfinancial management bill, which will strengthen accountability and clarify the financial authority \nof permanent secretaries, a key first step toward the devolution of decision-making authority. The \ngovernment will undertake public expenditure reviews that will help evaluate the effectiveness of \npublic expenditure, consistency with policy priorities, and results achieved and develop and \nimplement the medium-term expenditure framework. The planning framework prepared by the \nCivil Service Reform Management Unit will be pilot tested in at least two ministries before being \nrolled out to the rest of the government. The MOE will review its current financial management \ninformation system and commence implementation of the recommendations. The government will \ncontinue to implement electronic payments through digital platforms. ADB TA is available to \nsupport several of these reforms.20 Other development partners, including the Government of \nAustralia, the World Bank, and PFTAC, will also provide support. \n16.  Policy, legal, and institutional framework for state-owned enterprises and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. Although the profitability of Fiji\u2019s SOE portfolio has improved markedly \n                                                \n16  In March 2016, the government announced that from August 2016 it would change the fiscal year from a calendar \nyear to one beginning on 1 August and ending on 31 July. \n17  The Civil Service Reform Management Unit was set up within MOE to increase the efficiency, professionalism, and \naccountability of the Fijian public service.  \n18  Fiji\u2019s performance can be measured through the biennial Open Budget Survey (http://news.ccf.org.fj/fijis-open-\nbudget-survey-results/). In 2017, Fiji ranked 41 out of 100 countries in terms of budget transparency, and 15th for \nboth public participation in the preparation of the budget and oversight of the budget by Supreme Audit Institutions.  \n19  The government continues to implement a strategic shift from cash and other paper-based medium of exchange to \nelectronic payment forms, such as for social welfare and land lease payments. \n20  ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Fiji for Supporting Public Financial Management Reform. \nManila. \n \n ", "6 \nsince  2010,  productivity  remains  low  and  the  government  seeks  to  improve  the  sector\u2019s \nperformance  (para.  5).21 The  government  has  launched  a  program  of  SOE  divestment, \noutsourcing, and PPPs to bring in new private sector investment, innovation, and expertise. \nHowever, progress has been hindered by a lack of consistent and predictable policies and \nprocesses.  With  ADB  support,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises  (MPE)  has  progressively \nimplemented the following subprogram 1 policy actions to address these issues (footnote 9). \n(i)  State-owned enterprises reform. To progress of divestment of SOEs, the cabinet \nhas approved privatization guidelines to establish clear and transparent rules and \nprocedures for preparing and executing SOE divestments. These guidelines are \nexpected to lead to more efficient transaction processes and will be published to \nencourage investor confidence. The MPE is progressing several SOE transactions.  \n(ii)  Public\u2013private partnerships reforms. The cabinet has approved a PPP policy, \nwhich allocates lead responsibility for PPPs to the MPE and establishes a robust \nprocess for the undertaking of PPPs by Fijian government agencies.22 The policy \nwill facilitate future foreign and domestic private investment in infrastructure and \npublic service delivery in Fiji. The government has appointed the International \nFinance Corporation as a transaction advisor for a PPP transaction for the Ba and \nLautoka hospitals, to attract both foreign direct investment and expertise. \n \n17.  Subprograms 2 and 3 will seek cabinet approval to table a public enterprise bill in \nParliament to replace the Public Enterprise Act, 1996, which is outdated and no longer reflects \ninternational good practice. The bill, when enacted, will establish a clear framework to strengthen \nSOE governance, transparency, and accountability and to improve performance and service \ndelivery. Training programs for 75% of directors and 75% of senior management of SOEs on the \ncompliance requirements of the Public Enterprise Act will be conducted by MPE.23 To strengthen \nfinancial oversight and monitoring of SOEs, the government will develop and implement a new \nfiscal risk assessment framework, as well as a new policy framework for government guarantees \nand a new policy framework for onlending, support the reform of at least two SOEs, which may \ninclude a corporatization, partial privatization, divestment, liquidation, or substantial restructuring; \nor  formation  of  a  PPP,  develop  PPP  implementation  guidelines,  including  on  the  PPP \nprocurement process and appoint transaction advisors to support potential PPP transactions. \nADB will continue to support these actions (footnote 9).  \n \n18.  Business and investment climate. Foreign direct investment in Fiji is rising, averaging \n7.3% of GDP during 2012\u20132016. However, this is lower than hoped and inadequate to support \ntarget rates of economic growth (footnote 3). This reflects a weak investment climate affected by \npolitical instability and policy uncertainty, delays in addressing underlying structural constraints, \nand gaps in the commercial legal framework. Since 2006, the government has introduced several \nprogressive  structural  reforms  including  simplifying  the  taxation  system,  liberalizing  the \n                                                \n21  State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Public\u2013Private Partnerships (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2) provides additional information on the SOE portfolio, performance, and reform efforts. \n22  The PPP policy framework applies to government ministries, local government, departments, and agencies. \nApplication of the policy to public enterprises will be considered project by project. The policy framework specifies \n(i) the scope and application; (ii) a typical PPP process and steps in the project development cycle where ministerial \nand cabinet approvals are required; and (iii) the roles and responsibilities of various government stakeholders, \nincluding the MOE. Fiji previously had a Public\u2013Private Partnership Act, 2006, which contained provisions that \nlimited foreign investment, and lacked clear guidelines for developing and transacting PPPs. This was repealed in \n2016, in line with ADB advice. \n23  A significant improvement over 2017 where less than 25% of directors and senior managers were trained. \n \n ", "7 \n \ntelecommunications market, introducing competition in the land lease process, and strengthening \ninfrastructure services.24  \n \n19.  With support from ADB and other development partners, the government has taken further \nsteps to improve the business and investment climate in consultation with the private sector \nthrough the following subprogram 1 policy actions. \n(i)  Foreign  investment  and  trade.  To  boost  investor  confidence  and  reduce \nuncertainty around the resolution of international commercial disputes, Parliament \nhas passed international arbitration legislation that provides for arbitrations seated \nin Fiji and the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Fiji.25 The government has \nalso ratified the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), \nwhich  will  facilitate  reforms  to  improve  trade  competitiveness. 26 The  TFA  is \nimplemented through a National Action Plan, which has been endorsed by the \nNational  Trade  Facilitation  Committee  comprising  representatives  from  the \ngovernment, private sector, and civil society associations.27 In addition, the Ministry \nof Industry, Trade, and Tourism has consulted stakeholders for a review of the \nForeign Investment Act, 1999.28  \n(ii)  Access to finance. Parliament has passed the Personal Property Securities Act, \nwhich will enable lenders to accept movable assets as security for loans more \neasily, cheaply, and securely. This will facilitate financial product innovation and \nincrease  access  to  finance,  particularly  for  businesses.  The  existing  legal \nframework in Fiji had deficiencies, which increase the risk and cost to lenders, and \nrestricted lenders\u2019 willingness to accept such movable assets as security.29 \n(iii)  Ease of doing business. Parliament has legislated the Regulation of Building \nPermits Act, which establishes expedited processes for obtaining building permits, \nparticularly for commercial purposes, to reduce costs of doing business.  \n \n20.  Subprograms 2 and 3 will support the drafting of an investment policy framework and an \ninvestment bill. Fiji\u2019s compliance with its World Trade Organization TFA commitments, including \nthe approval and implementation of the National Action Plan, will see the completion of at least \n11 category B commitments. The government will establish the Personal Property Securities \nRegistry, and regulations will be made under the relevant act. The government also plans to take \nthe necessary steps for the International Arbitration Act and the Regulation of Building Permits \nAct to come into force. Finally, the cabinet will approve legislation relating to trademarks, designs, \n                                                \n24  The government is strengthening its competition policies and legal framework, and the capacity of the Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission, including the regulation of tariffs for infrastructure services provided by \nmonopoly providers. The government seeks to achieve competitive neutrality for SOEs and private businesses. \n25  International arbitration provides an alternative, cost-effective, and time-efficient means of dispute resolution \nbetween parties. It is recognized in 157 countries, including Fiji\u2019s major sources of foreign direct investment. Fiji\u2019s \nInternational Arbitration Act 2017 was passed after extensive consultations with private sector businesses and \nlawyers. It implements Fiji\u2019s treaty obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, 1958), known as the New York Convention, which it acceded \nto in 2010.  \n26  Business and Investment Climate Reform (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides \nadditional information on barriers to private sector development and ongoing reform efforts. \n27  The TFA contains provisions for expediting the movement, release, and clearance of goods, including goods in \ntransit. It also sets out measures for cooperation between customs and other authorities on compliance issues.  \n28  The new investment policy framework and legislation are expected to cover investment generally, rather than \nforeign investment specifically, which is now international best practice. This is expected to simplify investment \napproval processes, strengthen investor protection, and review restricted and reserved investment lists.  \n29  Personal Property Securities Act 2017. Examples of movable assets include equipment, inventory, crops, livestock, \naccounts receivable, and vehicles. \n \n ", "8 \nand patents, as well as a policy framework and drafting of a bill relating to competition and \nconsumer protection, which are all fundamental building blocks for private sector development \nand entrepreneurship. \n \n21.  ADB value addition. ADB has a longstanding engagement with the government on SOE \nand business climate reforms, though support for fiscal management and PFM reforms has been \nlimited. Through regional TA, ADB has provided advice on macroeconomic management and built \nfiscal planning and policy-making capacity.30 This experience and the strong relationship with the \ngovernment have helped ADB to play an important role in identifying and implementing critical \nstructural reforms \u2013 specifically ADB has directly supported the development of the medium term \nexpenditure  framework,  PPP  policy,  privatization  guidelines,  and  drafting  of  legislation  on \ninternational  arbitration  and  personal  property  securities,  and  will  provide  support  to  their \nimplementation. Given the recent administrative focus on post-cyclone reconstruction (para. 4) \nand  high  staff  turnover  of  middle  and  senior  management  in  the  government,  reform \nimplementation would have been difficult and costly without ADB analytical, technical, and \nfinancial support. ADB will support subsequent subprogram reforms through these TA projects. \n \n22.  Development partner coordination. The program is part of a well-coordinated multi-\ndonor package of support for structural reform. It is aligned with the World Bank\u2019s development \npolicy operations, also planned for approvals in 2018 and 2019. ADB is working closely with the \nWorld Bank, the Government of Australia, and PFTAC to support implementation. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  Implementation of these policy actions under the Sustained Private Sector-Led Growth \nReform Program is expected to improve the quality of budget systems and institutions, improve \nthe productivity and competitiveness of SOEs, and facilitate the creation of new businesses and \nformal  job  growth.31 Research  indicates  that  strong  budget  institutions  help  improve  fiscal \nbalances and public external debt outcomes, supporting the expectation that the program\u2019s reform \nactions on fiscal management will improve the fiscal balance. Improving the policy, legal, and \ninstitutional  framework  for  SOEs  in  Fiji  will  strengthen  governance,  transparency  and \naccountability, which is in turn expected to improve their performance and service delivery and \nhelp avoid unsustainable borrowing, reduce contingent liabilities, create more room for private \ninvestment, and improve reliability, efficiency, and affordability of public services. Finally, Fiji\u2019s \nbusiness environment reforms are expected to increase the distance to frontier score from 60.7% \nin 2017 to at least 64.0% by 2020.32 This improvement will bring Fiji close to the performance of \nKyrgyz Republic (65.17), South Africa (65.2), and Bhutan (65.37) in 2017. Divanbeigi and \nRamalho33 (2015) analyzed whether business regulatory changes, measured with the distance to \nfrontier scores, are linked to economic outcomes. Using panel data for 2003\u20132013 across more \nthan 180 countries, they found that an improvement of 10 points in the distance to frontier score \nis linked to an increase of around 0.5\u20130.6 new businesses per 1,000 working-age adults. Applying \nthe cross-country average effect in this study to Fiji, an improvement of 4 points in the DTF score, \nas indicated in the DMF, is expected to create about 95\u2013114 additional businesses annually. \n \n                                                \n30  ADB. 2009.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  The government has requested $180 million in financial assistance in the form of a \nprogrammatic approach, comprising loans of $15 million for subprogram 1 in FY2018, $55 million \nfor subprogram 2 in FY2019, and $110 million for subprogram 3 in FY2020 from ADB\u2019s regular \nordinary capital resources. The loans will have a 15-year term, a grace period of 3 years; an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Parallel collaborative partner cofinancing from \nthe World Bank will comprise $15 million for subprogram 1 and $35 million for subprogram 2. It \nwill help meet the government\u2019s total financing requirements from FY2018 to FY2020, projected \nat F$1.1 billion (about $530 million), and help finance ongoing post-cyclone reconstruction and \nsocial services and social protection programs. The gap will be filled by concessional project loans \nand domestic bonds. The program has considered the government\u2019s financing needs, its ability \nto rebuild fiscal buffers to respond to natural disasters, the availability of alternative financing \nincluding the estimated financial support from other partners, and debt sustainability. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The program is expected to be implemented over 40 months from January 2017 to \nApril 2020. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is January 2017\u2013February 2018. The \nMOE will be the executing agency. The MOE, MPE, Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism, and \nthe  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  steering  committee  (to  be \nestablished) will oversee program implementation and will meet at least four times a year, with \nmore regular meetings to align with key phases in the national budget cycle and for loan \nmilestones. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is  classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program \nactivities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. No activity will result in or lead to \ninvoluntary resettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n27.  The program is expected to have positive social outcomes (para. 23). The public sector is \na  key  provider  of  infrastructure  and  services  to  low-income  households.  Improved  fiscal \nmanagement will help ensure the government has the resources to respond to future economic \nshocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards (which tend to have an adverse effect on the \npoor) while maintaining critical public services. Improving policies and institutions for SOE reforms \nand private sector participation will increase competition, and make basic goods and services \nmore affordable, while creating more jobs and opportunities in Fiji. The government also agreed \nto comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.35 PFM systems are assessed as capable of \nsupporting mostly reliable service provision. Policy reforms and TA support will address other \nfiduciary risks. The overall risk of the operation is moderate. To mitigate the risks, the proposed \nprogram focuses on areas where the government has a strong record, selects options for policy \n                                                \n34   List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nactions in subprograms 2 and 3 that would help maintain reform momentum but allow some \nflexibility, and facilitates strong coordination with other development partners to ensure timely \nprovision of TA to support policy implementation.
