During the preparation of the North-West Crop Diversification Project,1 the Government \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to fund an agribusiness development project. \nAccordingly,  the  Country  Assistance  Plan  2000  included  a  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (TA) for agribusiness development for the year 2003.2 This TA paper is based on the \nwork of the Fact-Finding Mission that visited Bangladesh during 17 February\u20146 March 2003 \nand the understanding reached with the Government as set out in the aide-memoire dated 6 \nMarch 2003. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Bangladesh economy, accounting for 19.2% of \nthe gross domestic product, 23% of exports, and the livelihood of 62.3% of the population. \nDespite the large population of 130 million, scarce cultivable land, a very high person-land ratio, \nand the regular occurrence of natural calamities, Bangladesh\u2019s agriculture sector has performed \nwell. Helped by increased productivity and successive bumper crops, the sector\u2019s value addition \nhas grown 5% annually. As a result, the real prices of food have declined and the country is \nmore or less self-sufficient in rice.  \n \n3.  Developments in agriculture are increasingly giving rise to favorable opportunities for \ncrop diversification and growth in agribusiness, which is defined as the chain of activities from \ninput supply to production, processing, handling, and marketing. Agroclimatic conditions are \nsuitable for a wide variety of crops. Bangladesh\u2019s geographic location, for example, enables the \ncountry to supply winter vegetables to the European market. The large population represents a \nsizable  supply  of  low-cost  labor  as  well  as  domestic  market  potential.  The  potential  for \nagribusiness is demonstrated by the increase in area planted to horticultural and other high-\nvalue crops, and the rapidly growing dairy and poultry industries. For example, the domestic \nmarket for cut flowers and foliage is expanding at 10% per annum. The emerging middle class \nand the increasing participation of women in the labor force are increasing the demand for \nprocessed food products.  At least two large supermarket chains have been established in the \nlast few years to cater to this demand. \n \n4.  Despite the potential for agribusiness, growth has been slow. According to the latest \nBangladesh Census of Manufacturing Industries in 1995-1996, the number of food processing \nfirms grew by only 1% between 1988/99 and 1995/96. The number of medium and larger scale \nfirms in the sector remains small. According to a recent estimate, less than 0.5% of total \nBangladesh horticultural production is processed. Among the reasons for slow growth are (i) \nbarriers to accessing bank financing; (ii) erratic supply and relatively high prices and variable \nquality of raw materials for processing; (iii) a dearth of information on new technology; (iv) poor \ninfrastructure and communications; (v) lack of cold storage facilities and air cargo space; (vi) the \nsmall domestic market for most imported inputs, which limits the number of suppliers and gives \nrise  to  monopolies;  (vii)  the  tariff  structure  for  imported  packaging  material  acting  as  a \ndisincentive to agroprocessing; and  (viii) the large number of small landholdings, making it \ndifficult to organize the landholders. These constraints contribute to the perceived high risk and \nlack  of  competitiveness  associated  with  agribusiness  and  make  entrepreneurs  reluctant  to \ninvest in the sector. The private sector cites political instability, law and order conditions, and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Some private sector representatives claim \nthat private investment is being crowded out by nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which \nhave access to aid funds and enjoy tax advantages. \n \n5.  Since  Bangladesh  is  an  agrarian  country  with  a  large  rural  population  engaged  in \nagricultural production on increasingly fragmented landholdings, agribusiness is considered as \none of the primary means to reduce poverty. Currently, agribusiness is mainly on a small scale. \nIts  development  through  small-  and  medium-scale  enterprises  will  generate  income  and \nemployment for the poor. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is given in Appendix 1. \nWomen contribute significantly to agriculture production and cottage and small-scale agro-\nenterprises,  and  are  commonly  employed  in  agroprocessing  enterprises.  Agribusiness \ndevelopment  will  therefore  have  a  considerable  impact  on  employment  opportunities  and \nproductivity  improvement  for  women.  Unless  agribusiness  becomes  more  competitive, \nBangladesh will not be able to compete internationally when the World Trade Organization \n(WTO)  trade  regime  comes  into  full  effect  in  2005.  In  recognition  of  these  factors,  the \nGovernment has categorized agribusiness as a \"thrust sector.\" Agricultural reforms over the last \n2 decades, including dismantling state interventions and liberalizing trade in inputs and outputs, \nhave established a policy framework to conducive agribusiness development. The Government \nalso has a stated policy of playing a facilitative and regulatory role while leaving business in the \nhands of the private sector. Government policies are generally appropriate, but many of them \nhave yet to be implemented effectively due to lack of capacity, and others require refinements to \nbe more effective. Despite the importance given to agribusiness, the Government has yet to \ndevelop a coherent strategy for the sector.  \n \n6.  Extensive consultations with Government agencies, aid agencies, NGOs, the private \nsector, and other stakeholders were undertaken during TA formulation to learn from experience. \nThe findings indicate that agribusiness is at a very low level in Bangladesh, and that it's full \npotential is still unknown. Some aid agencies consider the development efforts in the sector to \nbe in danger of becoming overfunded because of the large number of external initiatives. Other \nsources,  however,  believe  there  is  ample  scope  for  further  agribusiness  development, \nparticularly for the small- to medium-scale agribusiness. In view of the large number of external \ninitiatives, the need to avoid duplication and contradictory activities is recognized. The TA \nformulation takes into consideration ADB\u2019s past experience in Bangladesh where almost all \nprojects  suffered  delays  of  3  years  on  average  because  of  slow  decision  making  by  the \nGovernment agencies concerned, lack of capacity in the relevant institutions, and delays in \nhiring  consultants.3  Experience  also  shows  that,  apart  from  thorough  project  formulation, \nagriculture  and  rural  development  projects  need  to  consider  the  overall  policy  issues,  as \nchanges in policy have an impact not only on the viability of agribusiness but also on food prices \nand other social safeguards that affect the poor.  \n \n7.  A number of external assistance programs are supporting the Government's small- and \nmedium-scale enterprises (SMEs) and agribusiness initiatives. The World Bank\u2019s Agricultural \nServices and Innovation Reform Project and Bangladesh Export Diversification Project aim at \nexport  diversification.  The  International  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  South  Asia  Enterprise \nDevelopment Facility (SEDF) is a regional program whose interventions in Bangladesh are \nspecifically aimed at increasing access to finance and business development support services \nas  well  as  improving  the  business  environment  for  SMEs.  The  SEDF  includes  a  sector \ndevelopment strategy for agribusiness to address the lack of innovation in the sector and the \nneed  to  provide  information  to  farmers  and  agroprocessors  through  an  enhanced  role  for \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997. Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Bangladesh. Manila. ", "    3 \nmiddlemen and NGOs. The Agro-Based Industries and Technology and Development Project of \nthe USAID is providing business support services to medium and large-scale enterprises. The \nDepartment  for  International  Development,  the  Swiss  Development  Corporation,  and  other \nsources are jointly providing business development services to SMEs and larger enterprises. \nADB  is  financing  the  North-West  Crop  Diversification  Project,  which  includes  a  pilot  for \nagribusiness development. ADB is formulating a Small- and Medium- Enterprise Development \nand  Export  Expansion  program,  which  will  have  components  that  (i)  create  an  enabling \nenvironment,  (ii)  give  access  to  finance  and  financial  services,  (iii)  provide  business \ndevelopment and support services coordinated by external sources, and (iv) offer programs for \nwomen entrepreneurs and workers in the ready-made garments industry.  \n \n8.  The ensuing agribusiness development project is envisaged to complement the existing \naid agency and Government initiatives. Rather than having a large investment component, it will \nfocus mainly on systemic problems affecting the agribusiness sector. The project will create an \nenabling environment for business formation and growth by (i) putting in place measures to \nimprove transparency and accountability, (ii) addressing bureaucratic bottlenecks that increase \nthe  transaction  cost  of  doing  business,  (iii)  improving  market  information  and  marketing \nsystems, (iv) helping the country acquire new technology, and (v) building capacity in the \nGovernment and the private sector. It is recognized that the impact of these issues on business \nin general is already being addressed by existing projects/programs. To avoid duplication, the \nensuing project will focus on the issues affecting agribusiness specifically. The project will not \nbe  limited  to  specific  subsectors  or  commodities,  but  will  identify  general  constraints  and \nopportunities  for  new  investment  that  can  be  supported  during  the  course  of  project \nimplementation.  The  project  will  identify  and  exploit  possible  synergies  with  other  ongoing \nprojects  to  optimize  investments  by  taking  advantage  of  the  existing  infrastructure  and \nproduction bases. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  design  an  agribusiness  development  project  to \naddress fundamental problems in the sector. The TA output is a feasibility study that will (i) \nevaluate in detail the constraints and impediments to the development of the agribusiness \nsector; (ii) propose strategies for addressing and overcoming the more significant constraints, \nincluding meeting WTO and other international trade requirements; (iii) identify the limiting \nfactors in acquiring technology and the mechanisms for improving such acquisition; and (iv) \nformulate a project for further development of the agribusiness sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be carried out in three stages. The first stage involves awareness-raising \nand collecting data. A series of participatory workshops and seminars will be conducted at the \ncentral,  district,  subdistrict,  and  village  levels  for  the  different  categories  of  stakeholders, \nincluding Government agencies, private sector representatives, NGOs, and representatives of \nethnic minorities to acquaint them with the concept and operation of modern agribusiness \nsystems  and  requirements  of  WTO  and  consumer  organizations.  The  seminars  and \nparticipatory workshops will also serve as the forum for the stakeholders to give feedback on the \nfactors limiting agribusiness development. This feedback will constitute initial data in identifying \nconstraints in the system that will receive further study during the second stage. The initial stage \nis expected to take 2 months. ", "4 \n11.  The second stage will study in detail and analyze institutional and systemic constraints \nto development of the agribusiness sector, and formulate recommendations for overcoming \nthese constraints. The study is expected to address four general areas: (i) implications of \ngovernment policies, rules, and regulations for agribusiness development; constraints in their \nimplementation; and delineation of the roles of the public sector, private sector, and NGOs; (ii) \nassessment  of  the  domestic  and  export  marketing  systems  for  agricultural  products, \nidentification of constraints, and analysis of the supply chain to highlight any distortions; (iii) \nassessment of the needs and constraints in identifying, sourcing, and applying appropriate \nproduction, harvest, postharvest, processing, and marketing technologies; and (iv) review and \nanalysis  of  constraints  in  the  delivery  systems  for  production  and  processing  inputs.  The \nproblems and constraints identified during the first stage will also be studied further. This stage \nis expected to take 2 months.         \n \n12.  The final stage will involve formulation of an agribusiness development project based on \nthe  findings  in  the  first  two  stages.  It  will  explore  mechanisms  for  implementing  the \nrecommendations in the second stage for simplifying business and credit procedures to gain \ngreater transparency, improving market efficiency, acquiring technology, building capacity in the \npublic and private sectors, and alternative means of product marketing and introduction of new \ntechnology for small-scale farmers and entrepreneurs. Recommendations will also be made for \nestablishing a system to continuously provide market information and intelligence to enable \nproducers and investors to identify niche opportunities. This stage will take 2 months.  \n \n13.  The expertise of consultants and the outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare in Appendix 2. Close consultation with Government agencies, private sector stakeholders, \nstakeholder associations and organizations, NGOs, and other aid agencies will occur in all three \nstages. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $815,000 equivalent, comprising $448,000 in foreign \nexchange  and  $367,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and $202,000 equivalent of the local currency cost for a total of $650,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining local cost of $165,000 \nequivalent  for  counterpart  staff  salaries,  and  office  and  other  facilities.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that TA \napproval does not commit ADB to finance an ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is \nthe  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  DAM  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  the  relevant \ndepartments and agencies as well as providing logistical support to the TA consultants. MOA \nwill appoint a full-time counterpart to assist in the overall coordination and support to the ADB \nMission and the consultants. The Mission requested that the counterpart staff continue in this \ncapacity throughout the TA and project implementation. The Government assured ADB of the \nprovisions  of  (i)  requisite  support  staff  in  addition  to  the  counterpart  to  support  the  TA \nconsultants; (ii) appropriate transportation for the counterpart staff; (iii) office space, utilities, \nfurnishings, and local communication facilities for the consultants and counterparts; and (iv) \nassistance in surveys and participatory stakeholder workshops. A steering committee, to be \nestablished  to  guide  the  TA  consultants,  will  meet  monthly  or  as  required.  The  steering ", "    5 \ncommittee will be chaired by the secretary of MOA and comprise representatives from the public \nand  private  sectors  including  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Ministry  of  Industry,  Planning \nCommission, and trade and industry organizations. \n \n16.   A  total  of  46.5  person-months  of  consulting  services,  \u2015  19.5  international  and  27 \ndomestic\u2015 will be required. The consultants will be specialists in agribusiness, agricultural \nmarketing, business development, financial systems, economics, environment, sociology, and \ninstitutional and legal aspects. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will be selected in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be used to select the consulting \nfirm.  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  begin  in  September  2003  and  will  be  completed  in  March  2004.  The \nconsultants  will  be  based  in  Dhaka  and  will  travel  extensively  for  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders. Workshops at the central level will be conducted at inception, and at the end of \neach stage to obtain feedback from the Government and private sector representatives and \nother stakeholders. The consultants will also conduct participatory workshops for farmers and \nentrepreneurs, local community groups, farmer's organizations, and NGOs to solicit their views. \nThe consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 2 weeks of commencement, outlining \nthe work program, methodology, and relevant preliminary findings; (ii) interim reports at the end \nof the first and second stages, reporting feedback from stakeholders, procedural constraints, \nimpediments  in  business  operations  and  marketing  systems,  and  recommendations  for \naddressing them; (iii) a draft final report containing the feasibility study for a proposed project \nwithin  5.5  months  of  commencement;  and  (iv)  a  final  report  within  0.5  month  after  the \nsubmission of the draft final report. Tripartite meetings involving the Government, ADB, and the \nTA consultants will be held after submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  for  Preparing  the  Agribusiness  Development  Project,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS (IPSA) REPORT FORM  \n  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?  Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \nAgriculture contributes 23.1% of the gross domestic product and plays a major role in the food security of the \npopulation. Growth in agriculture productivity has resulted in the country achieving self-sufficiency in rice and \ncontributed to a decline in food prices, thus benefiting the poor. Agriculture also accounts for 58% of the employment; \nhence, higher growth in the sector is seen as a means of reducing poverty. The small- and medium-scale enterprise \nsector comprises 80% of the manufacturing establishments and accounts for 80% of the labor force and 50% of the \noutput of the manufacturing sector. The development of the agribusiness sector is therefore expected to reduce \npoverty significantly.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Economic Growth \nDespite gains made in reducing poverty, about half of the population of Bangladesh live below the poverty line. \nPoverty is extensive in the country and a high percentage of the poor are found in the rural areas. Data (1999) show \nthat there has been a decline in poverty from 58.8% in 1991-1992 to 48.8% in 1999-2000 and suggests a slight \nimprovement in income distribution. Nevertheless, income poverty has declined by about only one percentage point \nper annum despite remarkable progress in human development over the last decade. There are differences in the \nnature of poverty between the various categories of poor, and this observation has so far not received adequate \nattention in Government programs.  \n \nThe underlying factor for poverty is the large population, estimated at 129.2 million in 2001, and a population density \nof 876/km2. The arable land that produces the country's food is under constant pressure from population increase and \nurban expansion. Population pressure is manifested in unemployment and underemployment. Although the official \nestimate of unemployment is only 2.5%, this is considered a gross underestimate that overlooks the large number of \nunderemployed. Some estimates of unemployment go as high as 25%. To compound the problem, an estimated 2 \nmillion people enter the labor force annually. Absorbing the growing labor force is a challenge. Often, the only avenue \nfor the growing labor force is self-employment in the low-productivity segments of the nonformal sector. Arresting \npopulation growth is therefore a means of addressing poverty, and progress has been made in that direction. The \nannual population growth in 2001 was estimated at 1.48% compared with 2.17% in 1991.  \n \nAnother contributory factor to poverty is the regular occurrence of natural disasters -such as flooding- that cause large- \nscale damage to crops, livestock, and infrastructure. The frequent natural disasters give rise to income erosion, which \nis especially serious among the poor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: The TA will involve participation of stakeholders at different levels and from different sectors: \nGovernment, production input enterprises, farmers and producers, traders, processors, exporters, and various service \nproviders. Farmers, women, and the rural poor will be active participants.  \n \nDuring the first stage of data collection, a series of seminars and participatory workshops will be conducted to raise \nawareness of the stakeholders and to obtain feedback from them on the constraints to agribusiness development. \nStakeholders will be involved in the second stage whereby detailed studies will be conducted on the chain of \nagribusiness activities from input supply to processing and marketing. The third stage of project formulation will be \ncarried out in consultation with the stakeholders.  \n \nParticipation strategy required. Yes. \nTA implementation will follow an integrated participatory approach. Involving stakeholders from various levels and \nsectors will ensure that the approach is adhered to. An important feature will be the participation of the target \npopulation in planning, project formulation, implementation, and monitoring.  ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n \n \nD.
