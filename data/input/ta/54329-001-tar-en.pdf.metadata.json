INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help Armenia improve resilience \nto  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  and  other  disasters  by  enhancing  and \noperationalizing its distance education system. The TA will (i) support the Ministry of Education, \nScience, Culture and Sport (MESCS) to develop and operationalize a comprehensive distance \neducation platform, and (ii) provide capacity building to the selected trainers on the use of the \ndistance education system for further dissemination to beneficiaries. \n \n2.   The TA is in country operations business plan for Armenia, 2020\u20132022 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) , titled Scaling up Innovation for Education Sector Development.1 The \nscope of the TA was redefined based on the MESCS request2 to respond to the outbreak of the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  by  supporting  quality  and  continuous  education  through  a  distance \neducation system.3 The TA aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (ensure inclusive and \nequitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all) and Strategy 2030's \nguiding principles of promoting innovative technology and providing integrated solutions.4   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a \npublic health emergency of international concern. As of 3 August2020, Armenia had one of the \nhighest incidences of COVID-19 globally, with 13,193 cases per 1 million population (compared \nwith the global average of 2,354.3) and 257 deaths per 1 million population (compared with the \nglobal average of 89.2).5 On 16 March 2020, the Government of Armenia declared a state of \nemergency to minimize the risk of COVID-19 infections. Aligning with the actions of many other \ncountries, the government closed schools and universities, resulting in the displacement of \napproximately 540,000 learners from their traditional education modality. \n \n4.  Following the state of emergency, Armenia\u2019s entire formal education system shifted to \nonline classes using platforms such as Zoom, and other online meeting services. To support \ncontinuity of education, the MESCS launched a learning materials storage platform on 17 March \n2020 using the website of the National Center for Education Technologies (NCET).6 The platform \nprovides learning materials and methodological guidance for teachers, as well as educational \nmaterials for students. The MESCS\u2019s emergency response includes a mix of digital and non-\ndigital platforms, social media, website storage, one free-to-air public service TV channel, and \ntwo cable TV channels. This effort helped to support partial continuity of education. However, it \nrevealed many shortcomings in the system that prevented the realization of effective teaching \nand learning for all students. According to the MESCS, 20% of the teachers and students were \nunable to join online classes because of (i) a lack of basic information technology skills, internet \n \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic (accessed 3 August 2020). \n6 Government of Armenia, MESCS. The NCET was established by the government in 2004. The main goal of the NCET \nis to introduce digital and communication technologies in schools and promote their sustainable use by students and \nteachers. The NCET also works to improve teachers\u2019 digital literacy with the emphasis of open-source educational \nplatforms. NCET operates the Learning materials storage platform. http://www.ktak.am/ (in Armenian).  \n ", "2 \naccess (despite high-speed internet coverage across the entire country), and devices;7 and (ii) \nthe limitations of the current distance learning system, which lacks (a) tools for content integration, \n(b) opportunities for communication exchange between educators and learners, and (c) many \nother functionalities of leading learning management systems. Furthermore, teachers needed to \nhave more access to methodological training that prioritized distance learning techniques (e.g., \nuse of video, activities, assessments, feedback mechanisms, quizzing), as well as subject matter \nmedia and other curricula. The MESCS also noted that the country\u2019s strict quarantine which lasted \nan entire academic semester for schools, in combination with a negative health, economic, and \nsocial outlook in the families of students and teachers, has caused a severe strain and stress that \nis adversely affecting learning outcomes. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has \nprovided support for assessing the shift to the emergency online classes, preparing video \nmaterials, and purchasing prioritized equipment. \n \n5.  Recognizing the importance of providing quality and continued education for all groups in \nthe  country,  and  especially  during  the  COVID-19  emergency,  the  MESCS  introduced  an \namendment to the Law on General Education in March 2020.8 Distance education tools can now \nbe used as an alternative to offline education under certain conditions. The MESCS also issued \na ministerial order in May 2020 to establish a procedure for organizing distance education, \nincluding the requirements for content, participants, participants\u2019 roles and responsibilities, certain \nconditions when distance education can be used.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: continuous, inclusive, and equitable quality \neducation for all public school students of Armenia developed.10 The TA will have the following \noutcome: distance education system improved.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Distance education platform developed and launched. The TA will develop, \ntest, enhance, and implement a national innovative distance education platform using existing \nand open-source learning management systems with artificial intelligence-assisted features that \npromote more efficient and cost-effective online education delivery. This output will address \naccess to education by providing more learning modalities and information in a learner-friendly \nformat. The platform will support kindergarten through grade 12 education institutions to deliver \nonline courses and support teachers in managing class rosters and posting activities and quizzes, \nreadings, materials, and grades. The distance education platform will incorporate the following: (i) \nopen-source platforms that use open web standards; have minimal flashy features; are adapted \n \n \n7 According to the Public Services Regulatory Commission, as of January 2020, only 0.8% and 10.5% of settlements \ndid not have a third and fourth generation mobile connection, respectively.

The distance education platform will \naddress the needs and diverse physical capabilities of learners, their caregivers, and teachers. \nThe learning materials of the MESCS\u2019s learning materials storage platform (footnote 6) will \nmigrate to the new platform after synchronization. As confirmed by the MESCS, the platform \ndeveloped under the TA will be operated and maintained by the NCET. \n \n8.  Output 2: Capacity for the use of distance education platform developed. The TA will \ndevelop online and offline manuals and guidelines on the use of the distance education platform. \nThe training design will pursue the use of the training of trainers methodology to maximize \ninnovation, scale, and cost-effectiveness. This output will address teaching quality by increasing \nthe capacity of teachers to use an improved distance education platform. The training program \nwill incorporate the following approaches: (i) techniques in blended learning; (ii) interactive \ntutorial-based, problem-based training; (iii) activity-based and constructivist approach learning; \nand (iv) techniques for teaching children with special needs. The training of trainers model will be \nused to support post-assistance and post-emergency sustainability. \n \n9.  The TA will also assist the MESCS to develop enabling government policies for providing \nequal opportunities for all teachers, students, and their caregivers to use the platform. In addition, \nthe  TA  will  develop  recommendations  for  the  institutional  and  regulatory  aspects  for  the \nmaintenance, operation, and upgrades of the platform. The recommendations will include (i) \nfunding mechanisms for the platform\u2019s continuous enhancements and upgrades; (ii) the most \nsustainable, efficient, and effective institutional setup; and (iii) the necessary institutional and \nregulatory changes to ensure safe use of data, and support the blended online and offline classes \nas a new approach to education. \n \n10.  Output 3: Targeted distance education content created and refined. The TA will, in \nalignment with outputs 1 and 2, support the development of selected online content of prioritized \nsubjects.  In addition, the TA will review the existing distance education curricula, and conduct a \nrapid assessment with MESCS administrators, students, teachers, and caregivers to identify the \ngreatest content gaps, which will determine the specific inputs needed for this output. Most of \nthese materials will likely be a blend of video formats for rapid rollout and integration into \nArmenia's predominant teacher training methodology. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000 of which $750,000 will be financed, on a grant basis, \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  2.
