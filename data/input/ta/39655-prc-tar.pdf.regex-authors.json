INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country program consultation held from 28 November to 2 December 2005, \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for preparing the regional road improvement project in \nthe Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). In response, the TA1 has been included in \nADB\u2019s 2006 assistance program for the PRC. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC on  \n6\u201312 January 2006 to prepare the TA proposal. The Mission (i) held discussions with central \nand local government officials, (ii) visited the project areas, and (iii) carried out an initial poverty \nand social assessment and a rapid environmental assessment. This report is based on (i) the \nagreement reached with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing and \nimplementation arrangements, and consultant\u2019s terms of reference for the TA; and (ii) the \nMission\u2019s findings. The TA\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC, with the largest territory in Asia and rapid economic growth over the past two \ndecades, plays an important role in regional cooperation and integration. Strong growth has \nincreased intraregional trade and capital flows. The PRC supports regional cooperation and is \nactively participating in the ADB-initiated Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nProgram,  which  aims  to  strengthen  economic  links  among  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  PRC \n(especially  Xinjiang),  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan. \nXinjiang, in northwest PRC and bordering eight countries,2 is the PRC\u2019s gateway to Central Asia \nand a bridge between Central Asia and eastern PRC. Xinjiang and neighboring countries have \nmany cultural similarities and economic complementarities, providing  a strong rationale for \neconomic cooperation. Transport is a priority area under CAREC. A Regional Transport Sector \nRoad Map for 2005\u20132010, which was developed in March 2005, identifies development and \nimprovement of regional transport corridors as a strategic priority for transport cooperation \namong CAREC countries. While the Government is investing in road infrastructure, due to large \nfunding requirements it needs external assistance to improve regional road infrastructure in \nXinjiang, which will facilitate traffic and trade between the PRC and Central and South Asia, and \nstrengthen regional cooperation. \n \n3.  Economic links between Xinjiang and neighboring countries have recently strengthened. \nIn 2004, trade between Xinjiang and eight neighboring countries grew by 25% over 2003 to \n$419.5 million. The number of tourists from these countries to Xinjiang also increased rapidly. \nSixty-three regional routes carried freight in 44.3 million ton-kilometers (km) and passengers in \n31.4  million  passenger-km  in  2005,  increasing  by  28%  and  42%  over  2004,  respectively.  \nThirty-one  enterprises  with  about  1,300  vehicles  in  Xinjiang  are  engaged  in  cross-border \ntransport services. Yet, barriers to cross-border transport continue to hinder expansion of trade \nand tourism. Regional roads not only need to be improved, but also border roads are poor, \nborder facilities inadequate, and cross-border road transport procedures complicated and not \nharmonized. While PRC vehicles can reach Bishkek and Oshi, Kyrgyz Republic vehicles are \nallowed to drive only up to Kashgar (not to Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang). Transit transport is \nalso prohibited in Xinjiang. These barriers must be addressed to complement road infrastructure \ninvestments and facilitate the cross-border movement of freight and passengers. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 December 2005. \n2  Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russian Federation, and Tajikistan. \n ", "2   \n4.  Roads are important to Xinjiang\u2019s economy, accounting for 95% of passengers and 83% \nof freight. Despite considerable investments,  the road network remains inadequate for the \ngrowing economy. In 2005, Xinjiang\u2019s road network was about 90,000 km, or 4.8% of the PRC\u2019s \ntotal. It comprises (i) 541 km of expressways, (ii) 883 km of roads in class I, (iii) 6,450 km in \nclass II, and (iv) 82,126 km in class III and below. Road density (5.4 km per 100 km2) and the \nproportion of high-standard roads3 to the total road network (8.7%) are significantly lower than \nthe national average (19 km per 100 km2 and 14%). The central and Xinjiang governments \nattach great importance to road development in Xinjiang and plan to expand the road network to \n150,000 km, including 22,000 km of high-standard roads (14.7% of the total road network) by \n2020. \n \n5.  With its consistently strong economic growth, the PRC has significantly reduced poverty. \nYet,  millions  of  people  remain  poor.  Remote,  landlocked,  isolated,  and  with  harsh  natural \nconditions, Xinjiang is one of the less-developed provinces, with per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) at CNY11,199 in 2004. Although GDP in Xinjiang has grown rapidly since 2000 \nmainly  because  of  energy  (oil,  gas,  and  coal)  developments,  economic  growth  has  not \nproportionally improved rural life. The per capita rural income in 2004 amounted to CNY2,245, \nor 76% of the national average. In 2004, about 2.2 million rural people lived below the official \npoverty line, and the poverty incidence was 18%, higher than the national average of about 10%. \nAbout 80% of the poor in Xinjiang live in the southern part of the region. The project area has  \n2 poor townships and 76 poor villages, with poverty incidence close to 10%. There are many \nreasons for poverty, but inadequate road infrastructure is an important one: many remote and \nisolated villages have limited access to markets, jobs, and basic social services (e.g., health and \neducation). The Government is implementing the Western Region Development Strategy to \nreduce development disparities between the western and costal regions and is committed to \ndevelop Xinjiang\u2019s transport infrastructure. The evaluation of several completed road projects \nfinanced by ADB4 shows that investments in road infrastructure significantly reduce poverty. \n \n6.  Road safety is a concern in Xinjiang: 9,527 road accidents resulted in 3,111 fatalities \nand 10,437 injuries in 2005, an increase by 13.8%, 7.6%, and 17.0% over 2004. In 2005, the \nfatality rate was 22 per 10,000 vehicles, higher than the national average. Economic losses from \nroad accidents amounted to more than CNY28.4 million. The major causes of road accidents \nare  (i)  lack  of  safety  features  and  facilities  along  roads,  (ii)  weak  enforcement  of  traffic \nregulations,  (iii)  poor  behavior  of  drivers  and  pedestrians,  and  (iv)  poor  road  conditions. \nExpressways have a lower accident rate than other roads because of their improved road \ndesign and divided carriageways. As vehicle ownership grows, more road accidents are likely \nunless urgent action is taken to prevent them. The Government plans to strengthen the public \nawareness program, improve data collection, and reduce risk behaviors of drivers under the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). \n \n7.  Since 1991, ADB has provided 30 loans, totaling nearly $5.6 billion, to finance road \nprojects in the PRC. All ADB loans in the PRC are generally being implemented satisfactorily. \nWhile ADB has yet to lend to Xinjiang\u2019s transport sector, Xinjiang has received three World \nBank loans totaling $600 million for road projects in the northern region.5 The first two projects \n                                                 \n3  High-standard roads comprise expressways and roads in classes I and II. \n4  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n5  The World Bank approved (i) a $150 million loan for constructing a 283 km highway between Turpan, Urumqi, and \nDahuangshan in 1994; (ii) a $300 million loan for constructing a 267 km highway between Urumqi and Kuytun in \n1996; and (iii) a $150 million loan for developing a 302 km highway between Kuytun and the Sayram Lake in 2002. \n ", "  3\nwere completed successfully and the third is being implemented satisfactorily. The Xinjiang \nCommunications Department (XCD) was and is the Executing Agency, and thus has experience \nin implementing aid-financed road projects. Lessons learned from ADB and World Bank projects \nwill be incorporated into the TA and project designs. \n \n8.  Promoting regional cooperation is a strategic theme under ADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic \nFramework (2001\u20132015)6 and its country strategy and program for the PRC.7 Since 1997, ADB \nhas been promoting the CAREC Program, together with five other multilateral institutions.8  \nAs Central Asia is landlocked, the latest regional cooperation strategy and program update for \nCAREC countries9 reconfirms transport as a priority for ADB assistance. ADB has provided \nloans to improve regional transport corridors,10 and TA to prepare investment projects and \nundertake studies to harmonize transport regulations and cross-border road and rail transport \nprocedures in CAREC countries. The TA, ADB\u2019s first in Xinjiang\u2019s transport sector, supports \nADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy for CAREC countries and the country strategy for the PRC. \n \n9.  Highway 314 is part of the Asian highway network and one of two key regional roads11 \nincluded in the PRC\u2019s National Expressway Network Plan, connecting Urumqi (i) to the Kyrgyz \nRepublic through the border crossings at Irkeshtam and Torugart, (ii) to Pakistan through the \nborder crossing at Kunjirap, and (iii) to Tajikistan through the border crossing at Kalasu. It will \nalso link these counties to Mongolia and the Russian Federation via the highway in northern \nXinjiang and the proposed road in western Mongolia,12 and thus has a potential to serve as a \nroute for regional transit traffic. The Government and ADB are helping the Kyrgyz Republic \nrehabilitate the road between Irkeshtam and Osh.13 ADB helped Mongolia undertake a pre-\nfeasibility study on developing the western regional road in 2005, and plans to provide loans to \nhelp develop the road in 2007\u20132008. Highway 314 is the only highway from Urumqi to southern \nXinjiang,  so  its  improvement  will  significantly  help  reduce  poverty.  Because  of  the  huge \ninvestment requirements, the Government plans to improve Highway 314 in a phased manner. \nThe Urumqi\u2013Toksun and Hosud\u2013Korla sections have been completed, and the Toksun\u2013Hosud \nsection is expected to be improved by 2007. XCD is considering requesting ADB assistance to \nimprove the Kuqa\u2013Artux section, and will finance improvement of the Artux\u2013Kashgar section \nbefore 2010. The project will upgrade a 296.5 km section between Korla and Kuqa of Highway \n314 from a class-II road to a four-lane expressway (Map), together with possible improvement of \nlocal roads and the roads from Kashgar to the Kyrgyz Republic border. The project expressway \nwill be on a desert plain along the southern foot of the Tianshan Mountains and pass through \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

The project area has \nabundant energy resources (oil, gas, and coal) and has experienced rapid economic development during the last 10 \nyears. However, the class-II national highway cannot handle future traffic. The project will upgrade the highway to an \nexpressway between Korla city and Kuqa county, joining the existing expressway to Urumqi. The project highway will \nreduce travel time and cost, thereby helping (i) speed up economic development, (ii) create jobs, and (iii) improve \naccess to social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project will directly help reduce poverty by (i) generating construction jobs in the short term, and (ii) improving \naccess to markets for specialty cash crops such as cotton and fruits. The project will substantially improve transport \ninfrastructure to facilitate rapid economic development that will create local jobs and income. \n \nThe project will improve access to social services in the county centers and towns. In the project area (two counties \nand one city), less than 10% of rural population lives below the official poverty line. There are 2 poor townships and 76 \npoor villages. Nearly all the poor are Uygur. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will assess poverty incidence in the project area and demonstrate how the project will help \nreduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in the project scope. The analysis will be based on Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001) and Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects (2001). \n \nC.
