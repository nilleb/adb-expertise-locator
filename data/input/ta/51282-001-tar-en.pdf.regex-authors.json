INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will accelerate the penetration of \nrenewable energy in the Central Energy System (CES) in Mongolia by (i) assessing the status \nand supply-demand projection of electricity and heat in the CES, (ii) identifying innovative energy-\nstorage technologies, (iii) assessing the market potential for energy storage, and (iv) developing \nan energy-storage deployment strategy.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operation business plan for Mongolia, 2018\u20132020 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).2 The TA is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor  Mongolia,  2017\u20132020,3  which  prioritizes  improving  natural  resource  management  and \nbroadening climate change response to support government priorities outlined in the Mongolia \nSustainable Development Vision 2030.4 The TA will also support the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s  \nStrategy 20305 to mitigate climate change and enhance environmental sustainability.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Secure and reliable energy supply and sustainable development are Mongolia\u2019s two \nbiggest challenges. Mongolia\u2019s energy system is largely dependent on coal, with combined heat \nand power plants the major sources of power and heating. Installed power capacity in 2015 was \n1,106 megawatts (MW); estimated power generation in 2017 and consumption in 2016 were 5.5 \ngigawatt hours (GWh) and 7.1 GWh, respectively.7 Current power capacity has not been sufficient \nto meet the demand for power, particularly during peak hours in mid-winter time, and all fast \nramping requirements and spinning reserve for frequency regulation and supply shortages8 are \ndependent on imports from the Russian grid.9  \n \n4.  Additional investments in energy capacity in Mongolia are required to keep up with the \ngrowing energy demand. Considering Mongolia's upward population growth and its rapid pace of \neconomic development, the heat demand in Ulaanbaatar is expected to grow 3.3% annually from \n2017 to 2030, from 1,803 gigacalories per hour to 2,748 gigacalories per hour. Power demand is \nexpected to grow 3.3% annually from 1,019 MW in 2017 to 1,561 MW in 2030.10 \n \n5.  Accelerating renewable energy and increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix \nis vital for Mongolia to develop a sustainable energy infrastructure and to achieve security of \nenergy  supply.  To  address  the  widening  supply\u2013demand  gap  and  to  strengthen  energy \n                                                \n1  The CES is Mongolia\u2019s largest and the most complex energy system, covering the main cities of Ulaanbaatar, \nDarkhan, Erdenet, and 13 provinces, and equipped with six thermal power plants and one wind farm. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Washington, D.C.  \nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mg.html \n8  \u201cRamping\u201d is the ability of a power plant in increasing or decreasing output to accommodate power demand. Spinning \nreserve is the on-line reserve capacity that is synchronized to the grid system and ready to meet electric demand \nwithin 10 minutes of a dispatch instruction by a system operator. Spinning Reserve is needed to maintain system \nfrequency stability during emergency operating conditions and unforeseen load swings. \n9  The Government of Mongolia\u2019s priority is to build reservoir hydropower. ADB has supported a detailed engineering \ndesign for this; however, because of environmental concerns for Lake Baikal, it has not progressed. \n10  ADB. 2013. Mongolia: Updating the Energy Sector Development Plan. Manila. \n ", "2 \nindependence in a sustainable manner, the Government of Mongolia has formulated a series of \npolicies to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. The State Policy on Energy, 2015\u2012\n2030 approved by Parliament in 2015, intends to achieve energy independence and to increase \nthe share of renewable energy to 20% of total installed capacity in 2023 and 30% in 2030.11 To \nmeet these mid- to long-term targets, renewable energy capacity of 633 MW by 2023 and 1,085 \nMW by 2030 will be required.12 However, currently as the CES has no spinning reserve (para. 3), \nit can only absorb up to 220\u2013250 MW of solar photovoltaic and 125\u2013175 MW of wind power \ncapacity at a 20% curtailment rate with the combined heat and power plants\u2019 operating load \nfollowing mode.13 In future, the power system will not be able to integrate all proposed renewable \ncapacities since higher share of renewables will result in great uncertainty and variability in the \nsupply\u2013demand balance. This requires enhancing the flexibility of the system by introducing \noptions such as energy storage in the power system.14 \n \n6.  Energy-storage technologies can offer a high flexibility at both temporal and spatial scales \nfor integration of electricity and heat systems. They are valuable in most energy systems to (i) \nimprove the efficiency of the energy system; (ii) help integrate higher levels of variable renewable \nresources;  (iii)  enhance  energy  access;  and  (iv)  improve  electricity  grid  stability,  flexibility, \nreliability, and resilience.15 The TA will support identification of technically feasible and financially \nviable energy-storage technologies within the Mongolian energy system, and the development of \nviable business solutions for scaling up their deployment. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact:  Mongolia\u2019s renewable energy capacity \nincreased.16 The TA will have the following outcome: increased readiness for investment in \nenergy-storage technologies.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Status and supply-demand projection of electricity and heat in the CES \nassessed. The TA will conduct the following activities: (i) analyze historical and current heat and \npower load curves at different temporal scales, (ii) forecast future locations of renewable energy \ncapacity and heat and power supply curves based on existing renewable energy development \nplan, (iii) evaluate the effect of added generation capacity on grid stability, and (iv) investigate the \ndynamics of prices for power and heating. Through this output, consultants will assess supply and \ndemand  of  heat  and  power  in  the  CES,  and  will  identify  opportunities  for  energy-storage \n                                                \n11  In 2014, the share of installed capacity of combined heat and power plants, hydro, wind, diesel genset, and small-\nscale renewable energy was 85%, 2%, 5%, 7%, and 1%.

Ulaanbaatar. \n13 In an energy system, curtailment is the reduction of output of a renewable resource below what it could have \notherwise produced. Variable renewable energy generation is often curtailed when its output is beyond the level the \ngrid system can absorb. Higher curtailment rate indicates lower utilization of renewables and is an impeding factor \nin integrating renewables into the power system. Load following modes mean that a power plant adjusts its output \nas demand for electricity fluctuates throughout the day.   \n14  International Energy Agency. 2017.
