The  Project  is  the  first  major  attempt  in  this\ndirection, and is designed to stimulate economic growth in\nSouthern  Province  by  promoting  private  sector\ninvestments  in  agriculture-based  enterprises.\nSimultaneously, the Project aims to assist in establishing\nan  enabling  physical  and  institutional  environment  to\npromote and sustain this process. Entrepreneurs wanting\nto invest in the region will be assisted by contracted private\nsector  agencies  to  identify  economic  opportunities;\nformulate  suitable  projects;  and  access  technology,\nmarkets, and financing. A credit line will be provided to\nmeet the medium- and long-term financing requirements of\npotential entrepreneurs. In addition, the Project will provide\nmuch-needed,  capacity-building  support  to  the  public\nsector,  and  in  particular,  assist  local  governments  to\nupgrade and maintain key rural infrastructure.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Assessment  Category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken. (Available as a supplementary appendix).\nRationale   Despite economic growth of 5.4 percent during 1990-1999,\ndevelopment and income distribution in Sri Lanka remain\nuneven.  Rural  areas  of  Southern  Province  continue  to\nsuffer from high levels of poverty and unemployment due\nto the predominance of low-value agriculture and limited\ndevelopment of value-added enterprises in the region. The\nGovernment has in recent years placed high priority on\ndevelopment  investments  in  Southern  Province  to\nstimulate its rural economy and achieve more balanced\nregional development. However, in promoting investment,\nthe Government recognizes the importance of a holistic\ndevelopment  approach  that  promotes  linkages  between\nagriculture  and  industry,  and  addresses  issues  of\nbackward and forward linkages to provide opportunities for\nfarm  households  to  graduate  from  their  subsistence\nincome levels to micro and small enterprises. It is also\ncognizant  of  the  many  infrastructure  and  policy\ndevelopments that have occurred in the last few years.\nFirst, the Government intends to operationalize a shift in its\npolicy  away  from  broad-based  integrated  rural\ndevelopment activities to the promotion of commercially", "iii\noriented economic activities in rural areas through linkages\nwith the private sector. Second, political will is growing and\nGovernment  intends  to  implement  the  current  policy  of\ndevolution  of  power  and  development  responsibility  to\nprovincial and local governments. Third, the Government\nrecognizes that for economic growth to continue, assets\nconstructed under different projects must be protected and\nkept from deteriorating through a sound and sustainably\nfinanced operation and maintenance program. In addition,\nconsiderable infrastructure investments are under way in\nthe Province. Prominent among them are the proposed\nhighway  from  Colombo  to  Matara,  in  the  center  of  the\nProvince, and the 550 kms of provincial roads which are\nbeing  upgraded.  When  completed,  these  two  road\nprojects, supported by the ADB, will considerably enhance\nthe  transportation  network  in  the  region  and  provide  a\nboost to economic activities.\nIn response to these factors, the Project is designed to\nfocus on stimulating private sector-led economic growth in\nthe rural areas of Southern Province, while at the same\ntime develop the physical and institutional environment to\nsustain the process.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project's  objective  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s\nefforts to accelerate economic growth and create income\nand employment opportunities in Southern Province. This\nis  to  be  accomplished  by  increasing  private  sector\nparticipation and supporting the devolution of responsibility\nfor planning and implementation to the provincial and local\ngovernments. The Project will focus on (i) establishing and\nexpanding micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in\nthe  region;  (ii)  providing  and  maintaining  key  economic\ninfrastructure; and (iii) enhancing public and private sector\ncapacities to facilitate, support, and sustain the process of\neconomic growth.\nThe Project comprises two interrelated parts that will be\nimplemented simultaneously. Part I is intended to stimulate\neconomic activity in the region and includes support to (i)\nenterprise development services, and (ii) a credit line for\nfinancing  term  loans.  Part  II  is  intended  to  build  an\nenabling environment for economic growth and includes\nsupport  for  (i)  providing  rural  infrastructure,  particularly\naccess roads and markets; (ii) enhancing the technical and\nfinancial capacity in local governments to maintain rural\ninfrastructure;  (iii)  providing  skills  and  capacities  at  the\nprovincial and Ministry of Plan Implementation (MPI) levels\nto  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  rural\ndevelopment; and (iv) providing project administration and\nmanagement.", "iv\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $42.7  million\nequivalent, comprising $13.2 million in foreign exchange\nand $29.5 million equivalent in local currency costs.\nFinancing  Plan           ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 11.2  13.8    25.0      58\nOPEC   2.0    3.0      5.0      12\nGovernment   0.0    6.7      6.7      16\nPFIs   0.0    2.0      2.0        5\nBeneficiaries   0.0    4.0      4.0        9\n           Total    13.2  29.5    42.7    100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund = Organization of\nPetroleum  Exporting  Countries  Fund  for  International\nDevelopment, PFI = participating financial institution\nLoan Amount and Terms  An ADB loan equivalent in various currencies of Special\nDrawing Rights 19,384,000 ($25 million) will finance $11.2\nmillion  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $13.8  million\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The loan will be from\nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  maturity  of  32\nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest\ncharge  of  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5\npercent  thereafter,  to  be  paid  semiannually.  The\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund for\nInternational  Development  (OPEC  Fund)  will  provide  a\nloan of $5 million equivalent to finance portions of the rural\nroad and market costs. The OPEC Fund loan will have a\nmaturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years,\nwith  an  interest  rate  of  1.5  percent  per  annum  and  a\nservice  charge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum.  ADB  will\nadminister the OPEC Fund loan.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 July 2008\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Plan Implementation\nImplementation The Southern  Provincial Council  (SPC)  and  the National\nArrangements Development  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (NDB)  will  be  the  two\nImplementing Agencies. SPC will be responsible for the\noverall  implementation  and  coordination  of  project\ncomponents, and will work through a project management\noffice, to be established at its provincial headquarters in\nGalle.  Specifically,  SPC  will  contract  and  monitor  the\nenterprise development services and coordinate with local\ngovernments  (pradeshiya  sabhas)  and  supervise  the\nimplementation  of  infrastructure-related  components.  A\nproject  management  committee  will  be  established,", "v\nchaired by the chief secretary of the Province to supervise,\nguide, and closely monitor project implementation.\nNDB  will  serve  as  the  apex  agency  for  the  financial\nservices  component.  The  Government  will  provide  the\ncredit  line  to  NDB  under  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement.\nNDB  will  administer  the  credit  line  through  selected\nfinancing  institutions;  supervise,  monitor,  and  report  on\nperformance of agencies and utilization of funds; and train\nstaff in the participating financial institutions.\nProcurement All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  done  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The\nmajor items to be procured will be equipment, materials\nand a small number of vehicles. Civil works will comprise\nmany  small  contracts  for  road  maintenance  works  and\nupgrading of market facilities with no single contract likely\nto  exceed  $200,000.  All  procurement  will  generally  be\nundertaken by the project management office.\nConsulting Services The Project will require 246 person-months of consulting\nservices consisting of 36 person-months of international\nand 210 person-months of domestic services. These will\nbe  largely  used  for  providing  technical  and  financial\ntraining of local government functionaries; helping select,\ndesign, and manage rural infrastructure; and assisting with\nthe formulation of detailed contracts and work programs of\nthe enterprise development services.

Finally,  the  private\nsector support agencies and nongovernment organizations\nwill benefit from enhanced capacity, expanded business\nopportunities, and greater acceptance as partners of the\npublic sector.", "vii", "     I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Province Rural Economic\nAdvancement Project, and (ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) of a loan for the Project to be provided by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) Fund for International Development.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. In 1997 the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka asked ADB for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a rural economic advancement project in Southern Province\nfor possible ADB financing. In line with this request, the TA was approved in 1999 and consulting\nservices were awarded in May 2000.1 The TA was divided into two phases: (i) to help the\nGovernment  develop  the  Strategic  Framework  and  Operation  Plan  for  rural  economic\nadvancement projects (REAPs), and (ii) to design the REAP for Southern Province. The first\nphase report was presented and discussed with the Government and ADB in July 2000. The draft\nfinal report for the second phase was presented in March 2001.The project scope, cost, and\nfinancing and implementation arrangements were further investigated and firmed up during the\nFact-Finding and Appraisal missions in May and July 2001.The Project is designed to capitalize\non  the  region\u2019s  resource  endowments  and  to  address  context-specific  needs  through\nconsultations  with  potential  beneficiaries,  the  private  sector,  and  local  government\nrepresentatives. A socioeconomic analysis and an impact survey were undertaken and a series of\nworkshops  convened  to  discuss  the  design,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  with\ngovernment  representatives,  external  development  agencies,  the  private  sector,  and\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  project  design  represents  the  views  of  a  wide\nspectrum of stakeholders in the country. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.   The Rural Sector\n3. Sri Lanka has traditionally been a rural country with a society based on village life and an\neconomy based on agriculture. This has changed somewhat over the last two decades with the\ncontribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product (GDP) declining from 30.3 percent in\n1978 to 19.7 percent in 2000, and the contribution of the service sector increasing from 44.4\npercent to 54.6 percent during the same period.2 These figures indicate an increasing trend\ntoward urbanization. However, almost all urbanization has tended to concentrate in Western\nProvince  and,  more  specifically,  in  and  around  greater  Colombo.    Most  other  areas  have\ncontinued  to  be  very  much  rural  oriented  with  economic  activity  predominantly  focused  on\nagriculture, livestock, fisheries, and forestry. Statistics also show that the level of poverty by\nprovince is proportionate to the rural share of its population. Thus, in Western Province where 50\npercent of the population is rural, the poverty level is 23 percent, whereas in Southern Province,\n80 percent of the population is rural and the poverty level is about 40 percent.3 This link of rural\nareas to poverty is a direct result of the inefficient and unproductive nature of much of the\nagriculture sector upon which the rural areas and rural populations are dependent. Agricultural\ngrowth has remained low for many reasons, including uneconomic landholding size; restrictions\n                  \n1  TA 3385-SRI:  Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project, for $800,000, approved on 29 December\n1999 (Financed by Japan Special Fund).\n2  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2001. Annual Report 2000. Colombo.\n3  The incidence of poverty is measured by the higher poverty line, which is set at SLRs950 per person per month.", "2\non land use; low level of technology; poor linkage to markets; and most importantly, limited value\naddition in the sector due to inadequate development of processing and agrobased industries. As\na result, while the economy has grown overall at a respectable rate of 5.4 percent per annum\nbetween 1990 and 1999 and 6 percent in 2000, growth in the agriculture sector has remained at a\nmodest 2.3 percent. Thus, the positive economic growth that characterized the country as a\nwhole over the past two decades has bypassed a large proportion of the population living in rural\nareas.\n4. The Government is employing several strategies to remedy this situation, including (i)\npromoting growth in the nonrural sectors to find alternative means of economic production for a\nsection  of  the  rural  population;  (ii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  agriculture  sector  by\nencouraging a switch to higher-value crops and improvements in the transport and marketing\ninfrastructure serving rural areas; (iii) promoting rural enterprises, especially those that relate to\nprocessing  and  marketing  of  agriculture  and  agriculture-related  products;  and  (iv)  improving\ngovernance and building the capacity of provincial and local governments to plan for and support\nrural  economic  development  by  increasing  the  devolution  of  powers  and  development\nresponsibilities.\n1.  Southern Province\n5. Southern  Province  comprises  three  districts:  Galle,  Hambantota,  and  Matara;  and\nstretches along the southern coast of Sri Lanka, extending 65 kilometers (km) inland at its widest\npoint.  It has a gross area of 554,200 hectares (ha) and is about 250 km long from the town of\nBentota in the west to Yala National Park in the east. The total population of the province is about\n2.4 million4 of which about 80 percent are considered rural and about 40 percent poor, according\nto the national poverty line.\n6. Land forms range from flat coastal plains in the south to hills in the north; the climate\nranges from wet and humid in the west to dry and arid in the east.  As a result, Southern Province\ncovers a wide range of natural ecosystems, and the land and water use patterns as well as the\nagricultural cropping systems are extremely varied. These range from forests and tea estates in\nrolling upland country in the north and east, through low-lying coconut and paddy areas in the\nwetter coastal plains, to semiarid lowland plains in the eastern dry zone. The latter are suitable\nonly for subsistence shifting cultivation or livestock production. Being a coastal province, fisheries\nand fish production are also an important resource use.\n7. Agriculture, the predominant economic activity, contributes about 30 percent of provincial\nGDP  and  about  48  percent  of  employment.  However,  the  importance  of  agriculture  as  an\nemployer varies across the province and increases considerably in the east; 36 percent of the\npopulation in Galle is dependent on agriculture as compared with 54 percent in Hambantota. The\nmajor export crops grown in the region include tea (43,000 ha), rubber (17,000 ha), coconut\n(46,000 ha), cinnamon (19,000 ha), rice (76,000 ha), banana (11,000 ha), and jackfruit (11,000\nha). The province produces 33 percent of Sri Lanka\u2019s tea and 75 percent of the world\u2019s cinnamon.\nIn 1999/2000, the combined value of annual and perennial farm production in the region was\nestimated at SLRs25 billion. Most of the tea is grown efficiently, but considerable scope exists for\nintercropping and value addition in coconut areas.\n8. Industrial growth in the region has been sparse and contributes only about 10 percent to\nthe provincial GDP and 13 percent to employment.5 One of the main reasons is that Western\n                  \n4  Extrapolated from 1994 sample census data and consisting of about 550,000 households.\n5  Provincial Planning Secretariat. 2000. Southern Province in Figures. Galle.", "3\nProvince continues to provide 80 percent of the industrial value added in the country and the\nindustrial base of other provinces, including Southern Province, has remained narrow and unable\nto absorb the large pool of educated workers. Tourism currently accounts for about 14 percent of\nprovincial GDP and 11 percent of employment, but despite potential, the sector has not been able\nto grow.\n9. As with the area\u2019s geographical characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics are also\nvaried. Although the human development indicators in Southern Province are relatively high,6 the\nconsumption poverty levels remain high, indicating a lack of economic opportunities in the region.\nThe economy is dominated by agriculture, and the poverty originates both from low productivity in\nagriculture, and more importantly, the sluggish growth of the nonfarm sector. At the same time,\nthe uneconomic size of landholding requires people to engage in off-farm employment to reduce\nvulnerability.7 This currently accounts for 15-20 percent of total income among the lowest quintile.\nThe 1982 census data places the average size of landholding in the province at 0.6 ha, with only\nabout 25 percent of households having farmlands of greater than 0.8 ha. Landholdings of this\nsize would normally support little more than subsistence activities.8\n10.  This situation is compounded by high levels of unemployment rates and lack of economic\nopportunities available to a considerable segment of the population. The unemployment rate for\nthe province was 14 percent, compared with the national unemployment rate of 11 percent. The\nhigh  unemployment  rate,  especially  among  the  youth  (33  percent),  and  the  relatively  low\ninvolvement of women in the formal economy are two major social problems in the province.\nNational data indicates that unemployment levels among women in the labor force have been\nconsistently higher than among men throughout the 1990s and the situation in Southern Province\nis similar.9 Increasing youth and female unemployment, despite the high overall school enrollment\nrate of 73 percent, is resulting in growing levels of social dissatisfaction among this potentially\nproductive segment of the population and is emerging as major Government concern.\n11. This situation can be redressed if the economy of Southern Province can be uplifted from\nits  prevailing  subsistence-based  production  patterns  to  one  based  on  commercially  focused\nproductive activities. Considerable development assistance has been directed to the province in\nthe last two decades, and a series of irrigation, agriculture, and rural development projects have\nbeen supported by ADB and other development agencies. These have assisted in building up\ninfrastructure, and in particular, expanding the irrigated areas in the region and promoting crop\ndiversification, but the region continues to remain disadvantaged. The last in the series of ADB\nrural development support initiatives to the region was the Southern Province Rural Development\nProject (SPRDP),10 which was implemented between 1992 and 2000. Planned investments in\nSouthern Province include the ADB-financed Southern Transport Development Project, which is\nto construct a highway from Colombo to Matara, at the center of the province. This highway,\nwhen completed, will cut the travel time between the two cities from the present four to five hours\nto about one and a half hours, and result in a major economic boost for the region.\n12.  Consultation with entrepreneurs, producers, processors, market associations, and local\ngovernments  have  identified  a  wide  range  of  potential  economic  opportunities  for  Southern\n                  \n6  United Nations Development Programme. 1998.

These  include  such  agriculture11  and  agriculture-related  enterprises,  as  intensive\nproduction and processing of high-value fruit and vegetable crops; export-based floriculture;\ngrading, packaging, and processing of spices; commercially oriented poultry and egg production;\nproduction and processing of fish; value-added, coconut-based products and intercropping of\ncoconut lands with pasture; fruit or timber species; production and supply of agricultural inputs\nand animal feeds; commercial dairy and milk-based products; leather and wood-based industries;\nand other supporting services such as transportation, marketing, milling,  packaging, etc. Indeed,\npromotion  of  micro-,  small-,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  could  provide  a  major\nstimulus  to  agriculture  production,  shifts  to  higher-value  crops  and  cropping  patterns,  and\nincreased exports from Southern Province.\n2. Rural Enterprise Support\n13. The Government recognizes that one of the main means to promote economic growth and\npoverty reduction in the rural areas is to create an environment in which private rural enterprises\ncan flourish, and that one of the main tools for accomplishing this is the provision of credit for\nsuch enterprises. Making credit more accessible to MSMEs is widely regarded as the most\nappropriate instrument because high costs of capital and its limited availability have been cited as\nthe major constraints to enterprise development. The aggregate demand for small- and medium-\nsized enterprise (SME) credit, without including microcredit, for 13 domestic lending institutions\nwas estimated at $262.5 million for 1997-2001.  Credit demand for 2001 was placed at $68\nmillion.12 Moreover, trends in the country indicate a 15 to 20 percent annual growth in the credit\ndemand for this sector.\n14.  The principal financing available for this type of credit has been from the externally funded\nrefinance schemes, mainly financed by the World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation\n(JBIC), and ADB. During 1994-1999 these resources supported approximately 25,000 enterprises\nthrough commercial banks, regional development banks, cooperatives, and NGOs.13 Of these,\nslightly more than 50 percent in terms of number and slightly less than 50 percent in terms of loan\namount were for agriculture and agriculture-related activities; about 15 percent were located in\nSouthern Province. The rapid disbursement of MSME credit provided by a range of domestic\nlending institutions and international funding agencies indicates the need and likely high level of\nunmet demand.  Funds provided by JBIC under its Small and Micro-Industries Leader and\nEntrepreneur Promotion (SMILE) project,14 for example, were fully committed within two years of\nstart-up.\n15.  Funds are channeled to the MSMEs through commercial banks, development banks, and\nnonbank finance companies. The two gaps identified are  (i) the inadequacy of subloans ranging\nfrom SLRs1.0 million to SLRs5.0 million, and (ii) the shortage of term financing (medium- to long-\nterm loans that are more suited to the enterprise sector than short gestation loans). Lack of term\nfunds in Sri Lanka are largely attributed to the Government\u2019s appropriation of funds from the\nfinancial system through treasury bills to meet budgetary deficits, largely caused by high defense\nexpenditure on the continuing civil war in the country. The increased budget deficit in 2000\ncompelled the Government to increase its borrowings from the domestic market significantly.\nConsequently, domestic financing of the deficit increased from 6.8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 9.4\n                  \n11  Agriculture  includes crop production, livestock, fisheries, forestry, and their supporting agro-industries.\n12  Loan 1522-SRI: Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $ 55 million, approved on 5 June 1997.\n13  The discussion on credit flow to SMEs is constrained by data limitations as neither the Central Bank of Sri Lanka\nnor banks collect and collate SME data systematically. The information in this document was compiled from\nvarious sources and analysis is primarily based on externally funded projects rather than on overall SME financing\nby banks.\n14  The project started in 1997 with funding of $46 million.", "5\npercent in 2000 (footnote 2). This situation means that banks must mainly rely on short-term\ndeposits  for  the  bulk  of  their financing,  thereby  making  credit  both  scarce  and  expensive.\nUnfortunately, equity and venture capital services have not been able to expand and fill the gap in\nlong-term financing, and consequently, entrepreneurs have suffered. An overview of the financial\nsystem in the country is provided in Appendix 2.\n16.  Several commercial and development banks and NGOs are providing credit support in\nSouthern Province. But most loans are small, averaging $50 to $100 from the NGOs, $250 from\ncooperative rural banks, and about $300 from the regional development bank. Commercial bank\nloans  average  about  $1,000,  but  availability  is  limited.  Loans  provided  under  the  credit\ncomponent of the SPRDP show a similar pattern, with an average loan size of $500; the majority\nrange from $100 to $200. In addition, nearly 90 percent of these loans have been for short-term\npurposes with interest rates ranging from 18 to 36 percent. Term financing has been limited, both\nbecause  of  shortage  of  funds  and  skills  to  administer  such  loans.  Nonetheless,  some\nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  have  had  a  notable  degree  of  success  in  microenterprise\nfinancing, for example, the Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (SEEDS).\nClearly, the range and terms of enterprise credit must be increased, especially in subsectors\nwhere economic potential is identified.\n17. Over a decade of experience with enterprise financing in the country has demonstrated\nthat other factors, such as access to technology, requisite skills, and market information, are as\nimportant as credit. In response to these requirements, some encouraging developments have\ntaken place in the country, including the recent formation of the National Agribusiness Council (a\nprivate apex agency representing 18 major agribusiness associations) to support and promote\nagribusiness enterprises in the country through policy advocacy, technology, and market linkage.\nIn addition, some private sector organizations including several chambers of commerce and\nNGOs  have  established  enterprise  advisory  and  information  services.  A  few  private  sector\nspecialized skills development agencies have also emerged and are imparting demand-based\ntechnical and financial training to entrepreneurs. But these are clearly not adequate to address\nthe needs of a growing enterprise sector. In addition most of these facilities and services are\nColombo based, have limited outreach, and therefore cannot be accessed and utilized by the\nsmaller and outlying entrepreneurs. Success stories include the SEEDS, which is demonstrating\nthe demand and utility of such support services. The SEEDS rural enterprise program by 2000\nhad  provided  services  to  some  30,000  microenterprises  and  assisted  about  2,800  of  their\nborrowers with market contacts.\nB.  Government\u2019s Policies and Plans\n18. One  of  the  Government\u2019s  new  strategic  initiatives  is  to  harness  pro-poor  growth  by\nimproving productivity and market access for the small-scale enterprise sector.15 It recognizes\nthat  primary  agriculture  production  alone  is  unlikely  to  generate  significant  increases  in\nemployment opportunities. Therefore, the Government is focusing on creating employment in\nrural industry and services as a major means of economic growth and poverty reduction. Rural\nenterprise promotion is  expected to contribute to poverty reduction, not only through employment\ngeneration but also through linkages with primary agriculture production, service enterprises such\nas  transport,  agriculture  input  supply,  and  other  small  industries.  The  Government  policy\nframework recognizes that facilitating MSMEs is critical to achieving the objectives of expanding\nthe country\u2019s industrial base, efficiently adding value to the country\u2019s resource endowments, and\n                  \n15  Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka: A Framework for Poverty Reduction. November 2000.\nColombo.", "6\ngenerating employment and exports. The proposed Project is in line and fully consistent with\nthese Government policies.\n19. With regard to rural development, the Government's policy framework recognizes that\nseveral  decades  of  public  and  external  development  investments  in  broad-based  rural\ndevelopment  projects  have  resulted  in  little  sustainable  impact.  The  Government  has  thus\ndecided to move away from the earlier integrated rural development project (IRDP) approach to a\nmore integrated and focused approach in rural development in order to lay the foundation for\naccelerating  economic  growth.  This  new  genre  of  development  approach  focuses  on  rural\nrevitalization by promoting commercial activities in both farm and nonfarm sectors in active\ncollaboration with the private sector. Simultaneously, the new approach is to be incorporated into\nthe ongoing process of devolution of development responsibilities from the central Government to\nthe provincial councils and elected local governments (pradeshiya sabhas). The Government has\ntermed this paradigm shift as \u201crural economic advancement.\" In other words, the Government\nintends to undertake future rural development efforts through REAPs, reflecting a move away\nfrom a top-down, public sector-led approach to one that is decentralized and includes the private\nsector as a partner to stimulate economic growth. The proposed Project will be one of the first\nmajor projects designed to operationalize this new strategy.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n20. In the last three decades, external funding agencies, including ADB, have financed a\nnumber of projects in Southern Province. Projects supported by ADB that primarily relate to\nagriculture, rural development, and infrastructure improvement include the Uda Walawe Rural\nDevelopment Project,16 Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project,17 First and Second Tea\nSmallholders Development projects,18 First and Second Perennial Crops Development projects,19\nSouthern Provincial Roads Improvement Project,20 Southern Transport Development Project,21\nand the Southern Province Rural Development Project (footnote 10). The World Bank financed\nthe Third Roads Improvement Project,22 which upgraded class A roads throughout the province.\n21. In terms of rural development, 36 IRDP projects were undertaken in Sri Lanka during\n1979-2000.23  These  ranged  from  small  efforts  of  less  than  $2.0  million  by  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme and such bilateral agencies as Norwegian Agency for Development\nCooperation  (NORAD),  Deutsche  Gesselschaft  fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  and\nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), to major efforts by the World\nBank and ADB (the largest being the World Bank-financed Second Rural Development Project for\n$80.0 million).24 Three IRDPs were implemented in Southern Province, one supported by ADB\nand two supported by Swedish and Norwegian assistance in Matara and Hambantota districts.\n                  \n16  Loan 0017-SRI: Walawe Development Project, for $885,000, approved on 23 October 1969.\n17  Loan 0324-SRI: First Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project, for $24 million, approved on 9 December 1977;\nLoan 0612-SRI: Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project (Supplementary), for $10 million, approved on 9\nDecember 1982; Loan 0794-SRI: Second Kirindi Oya Irrigation and Settlement Project, for $26 million, approved\non 30 October 1986.\n18  Loan 0955-SRI: Smallholder Tea Development Project, for $25 million, approved on 21 February 1989.\n19  Loan 0899-SRI: First Perennial Crops Development Project, for $17 million, approved on 30 August 1988; Loan\n1522-SRI: Second Perennial Crops Development Project, for $20 million, approved on 25 September 1997.\n20  Loan 1567-SRI: Southern Provincial Roads Improvement Project, for $30 million, approved on 30 October 1997.\n21  Loan 1711-SRI: Southern Transport Development Project, for $90 million, approved on 25 November 1999.\n22  Loan 1312-SRI: Third Road Improvement Project, for $55 million, approved on 15 September 1994.\n23  Of which two were financed by ADB:  the Southern Province Rural Development Project and the North Central\nRural Development Project.\n24  Approved in 1981.", "7\nDetails of external assistance to the rural development sector in Sri Lanka are given in Appendix\n3.\n22.  Other  related  external  assistance  to  the  country  include  the  ADB-funded  Small  and\nMedium Industries projects I and II25 and the Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project\n(footnote 12), which have supported the establishment of about 11,500 SMEs with dedicated\ncredit lines. The World Bank also assisted the SME sector through two loans during 1979-1987.\nJBIC provided two nationwide loans: SMILE I and II (footnote 14) to provide access to term\nfinance for SMEs and to enhance the institutional capacities of participating financial institutions.\nThe second phase of the loan commenced in April 2001.\nD. Lessons Learned\n23. A 1997 study of postevaluated projects in Sri Lanka26 and lessons learned from several\nADB-financed agriculture, rural development, and finance projects highlight the importance of  (i)\nproper  staffing  and  institutional  and  project  management  capability  in  the  executing  and\nimplementing  agencies;  (ii)  beneficiary  participation  and  involvement  in  project  design,\nimplementation, operation, and maintenance; (iii) a flexible project implementation system based\non  a  process-oriented  approach;  (iv)  establishment  of  benefit  monitoring  mechanisms  and\nobtaining pre-project benchmark data; and (v) need for continuous and close monitoring by ADB\nespecially early in project implementation.\n24. Postevaluation studies of projects in Sri Lanka also highlight the importance of agriculture\nand rural credit schemes to be complemented by business skills development, training, and\nextension services, to ensure that credit is effectively invested and that projects are sustainable.\nRoads and road transport projects have highlighted the need to encourage small contractors and\nimprove their capacity for better maintenance of infrastructure. Lessons learned from ADB-funded\nSME projects indicate that credit lines acted as effective modalities for transferring term capital to\nSMEs, and that participation of banks strengthened their ability to appraise and administer SME\ncredit. They also point to the need to upgrade capacity of field staff, and to closely monitor\nsubloans. Lessons emerging from earlier projects have been fully incorporated in the design of\nthis Project.\n25. The most critical lessons learned from IRDP implementation in the country is the need to\nuse a focused and integrated approach; involve the private sector in efforts aimed at rural\neconomic regeneration; and address agriculture production, processing, and manufacturing as\npart of a continuum for economic advancement. These lessons are already incorporated in the\nREAP approach adopted by the Government. Another lesson learned from the IRDPs is that the\nimpact of infrastructure has not always been sustainable. Often insufficient provision was made\nfor the continued operation and maintenance (O&M) of project infrastructure and, in terms of\nprivate sector support, not enough attention has been paid to continuing support programs or\nundertaking future sector expansion. The medium- to long-term impacts have therefore been\nsomewhat less than what might have been planned or expected.\n26. In terms of specific lessons to be learned from projects, the most relevant project is the\nSPRDP, which was implemented during 1992-2000 in Southern Province. The Government's\nevaluation indicates that (i) adequate capacity exists in the provincial government to implement\nrural development projects; (ii) activities such as credit provision for rural enterprises, promotion\n                  \n25  Loan 0873-SRI: Small and Medium Industries Project, for $15 million, approved on 8 December 1987; Loan 1084-\nSRI: Second Small and Medium Industries Project, for $30 million, approved on 30 May 1991.\n26  ADB. 1997.  Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Sri Lanka. Manila.", "8\nof new technologies, and construction of rural infrastructure can be successfully carried out at the\nprovincial level; (iii) institutional arrangements for the different components need to be carefully\nworked out and put in place to avoid start up delays; and (iv) advance action must be initiated in\nrecruiting consulting services. The evaluation also highlighted two other problems: (i) rural roads\nbuilt under the project are poorly maintained due to funding limitations and lack of technical\ncapacity in local governments; and (ii) new entrepreneurs need technical guidance and support,\nand access to credit.\n27.  Experience from the ongoing North Central Rural Development Project27 provides similar\nlessons.  Most notably, the project did not provide a credit line for rural enterprises; financing\nagencies were expected to have sufficient funds to meet the project-generated demand for credit.\nIn reality, however, without a designated credit line devoted to the project, financing agencies\nwere reluctant to adapt their programs and priorities to project requirements.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n28.  ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy28 emphasizes pro-poor sustainable economic growth,\nsocial development, and good governance as its three pillars. It focuses on the development of\nthe agriculture and rural sectors, since it is in the rural areas and especially in the low-value\nagriculture sector that poverty is most prevalent. The current country operational strategy for Sri\nLanka29 states that given the scarcity of ADB funds and large assistance by other development\nagencies to the sector, the approach for ADB\u2019s involvement in rural development needs to be\nreestablished in light of ADB\u2019s focus on policy reform and institutional development, and the\nGovernment\u2019s reorientation of rural economic activities. While past ADB assistance has had a\nsignificant  development  impact,  a  major  question  has  been  on  the  sustainability  of  project\nbenefits. The Government recently redirected its traditional approach for rural development and\nintroduced the REAP policy framework. This is aimed at fostering rural development led by the\nprivate sector and transforming the Government\u2019s role from a direct provider of development\nassistance to an enabler or facilitator of sustainable rural development. Given the redirection of\nthe policy framework, ADB\u2019s country assistance plan (2001-2003) and its country strategy and\nprogram update, currently being finalized, support ADB\u2019s role in creating opportunities for the\npoor to participate in economic growth through the new REAP process. ADB\u2019s new focus on\npoverty reduction also supports its involvement in rural development in Southern Province where\nthe  incidence  of  poverty  is  high.  The  design  of  the  proposed  Project  is  therefore  entirely\nconsistent with the intent and directions of ADB's country and sector strategy.\nF.   Policy Dialogue\n29. The  project  preparation  process  commenced  with  active  consultation  with  the\nGovernment, academicians, civil society representatives, and development partners on defining\nthe  Government\u2019s  new  rural  development  approach  in  the  country,  and  its  key  thrusts  and\nimplications. The first consultative output of this process was the REAP strategy and operational\nframework, which clarified the Government\u2019s future policy on rural development; its strategic\neconomic thrust, the focus on the nonfarm sectors, linkages between the farm and nonfarm\nsectors,  private  sector  promotion,  public-private  partnerships  for  economic  growth,  capacity\n                  \n27  Loan 1462-SRI: North Central Province Rural Development Project, for $20 million, approved on 24 September\n1996.\n28  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in the Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank, 19 October 1999.\n29 ADB. 1998. Promoting the Environment for Growth, Sri Lanka Country Operational Strategy. Manila.", "9\nenhancement  for  financial  sustainability,  and  possible  implementation  modalities.30  The\nGovernment demonstrated understanding and willingness to address issues especially relating to\nthe implicit change in the role of the Government in this process and requirements of new\ninstitutional capacities, the role of the private sector, and the need to make private sector services\nself-sustaining  through  fee-based  operations  after  the  initial  establishment  phase.  The\nGovernment has fully concurred with the approach taken in the project design for economic\nstimulation  by promoting micro and small private enterprises.\n30.  In addition, several other policy issues were taken up with the Government during the\nproject preparation. The primary one was the ongoing devolution of development responsibilities\nto the provincial government and pradeshiya sabhas under the Thirteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution. The Government agreed that in keeping with the principle of devolution, the prime\nresponsibility for project implementation will rest with the Southern Provincial Council (SPC),\nwhile  much  of  the  actual  implementation  work  will  be  devolved  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas\nthemselves. At the same time, project preparation work raised the key question of sustainable\nfunding for rural infrastructure O&M. The Government agreed that any upgrading and transitional\nmaintenance support for rural infrastructure to the pradeshiya sabhas will be contingent upon\ntheir  participation  in  the  financial  management  training,  improved  budgetary  management,\nexpected counterpart funding, and regular performance and capacity evaluation during project\nimplementation.\n31.  Policy discussions were also undertaken with the Government and the Central Bank of Sri\nLanka  (CBSL)  on  the  overall  financial  sector  issues  in  the  country,  and  specifically  on  the\ncontinuing shortage of long-term funds in the system and the consequent prevalence of high\ncommercial lending rates (around 25 percent). These sectorwide issues will be taken up in detail\nwith the Government as part of the implementation of the Rural Finance Sector Development\nProject.31 For the Project, the Government and ADB agreed that the project credit line for term\nfinance  will  be  routed  through  an  apex  commercial  bank,  and  that  the  relending  rates  to\nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs), will be anchored on the average weighted deposit rates\n(AWDR), which are periodically calculated by CBSL. In addition, synergy will be ensured with the\npolicy framework being addressed by the Private Sector Development Program32 and the Small\nand Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (footnote 12) to increase private sector activity and\npromote competition to intensify resource mobilization, improve economic efficiency, and raise\nproductivity.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n32. Despite economic growth of 5.4 percent during 1990-1999, development and income\ndistribution in Sri Lanka remain uneven. Rural areas of Southern Province continue to suffer from\nhigh levels of poverty and unemployment due to the predominance of low-value agriculture and\nlimited development of value-added enterprises in the region. The Government therefore places\nhigh priority on development investments in Southern Province to stimulate its rural economy and\nachieve more balanced regional development in the country. However, in increasing investments\nin the area, the Government recognizes the importance of a holistic development approach that\npromotes linkages between agriculture and industry, and addresses issues of backward and\n                  \n30 The  Government  and  the  ADB  agreed  that  restructuring  of  the  central  ministry  and  the  implementation\narrangements be further examined and developed as more experience is gained from REAP implementation.\n31   TA 3707-SRI: Rural Finance Sector Development Project, approved for $550,000, on 24 August 2001.\n32  Loan 1800-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, approved for $ 85 million, on 12 December 2000", "10\nforward linkages to provide opportunities for farm households to graduate from their subsistence\nincome levels to micro and small enterprises. The Government is also cognizant of the many\ninfrastructure and policy developments that are under way in the province and the country, and\nthat impact on the strategy for rural economic growth.\n33. First, the Government intends (para. 19) to operationalize a shift in its policy away from\nbroad-based IRDPs to the promotion of commercially oriented activities through linkages with the\nprivate sector. Second, political will is growing and the Government intends to implement, in\npractice, the current policy of devolution of power and development responsibility to provincial\nand local governments. Third, the Government recognizes that for economic growth to continue,\nassets constructed under the SPRDP and other similar projects must be protected and kept from\ndeteriorating through a sound and sustainably financed O&M program. In addition, considerable\ninfrastructure investments are under way in Southern Province. Prominent among these are the\nproposed highway from Colombo to Matara, and the 550 km of provincial roads being upgraded.\nWhen completed, these two road projects supported by ADB will considerably enhance the\ntransportation network in the region and provide a boost to economic activities.\n34. In response to these factors, the Project is designed to focus on stimulating private sector-\nled economic growth in the rural areas of Southern Province, while at the same time developing\nthe physical and institutional environment to support and sustain the process.\nB.   Objective and Scope\n35. The Project's objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to accelerate economic\ngrowth and create additional income and employment opportunities in Southern Province. This\nwill be accomplished by (i) establishing and expanding MSMEs in agriculture-related sectors; (ii)\nproviding and maintaining key economic infrastructure; and (iii) enhancing public and private\nsector capacities to facilitate, support, and sustain the process of economic growth. Special\nemphasis will be placed on unemployed youth and women with the objective of providing them\nwith productive and sustainable income and employment opportunities.\n36. The Project comprises two interrelated parts that will be implemented simultaneously. Part\nI is intended to stimulate economic activity in the region and includes support to (i) enterprise\ndevelopment services (EDS); and (ii) a credit line for financing term loans. Part II is intended to\nbuild an enabling environment for economic growth and includes support for (i) providing rural\ninfrastructure, particularly rural roads and markets; (ii) enhancing technical and financial capacity\nin local governments to maintain rural infrastructure; (iii) providing skills and capacity at the\nprovincial and Ministry of Plan Implementation (MPI) levels to facilitate private sector participation\nin rural development; and (iv) providing project administration and management.\n1. Part I  Stimulating Economic Growth\n37. The major part of this component will be a credit line aimed at promoting MSMEs in\nSouthern Province. Recognizing that a credit line by itself is not sufficient to stimulate economic\ninnovation, the Project will contract private advisory services to provide agricultural producers and\nentrepreneurs a link to new technologies, marketing channels, technical and managerial skills,\nfinancial services, and key information. The focus of this component is on stimulating private\nsector  activity  and  building  up  sustainable  enterprise  support  services.  Part  I  has  two\ncomponents: advisory services to guide entrepreneurs and a credit line to enable investment.", "11\na. Enterprise Development Services\n38. Considerable  potential  exists  in  Southern  Province  for  a  wide  variety  of  economic\nenterprises  in  rural  areas,  including  moving  from  traditional  low-value  crops  to  high-value\nproduction and to secondary value-adding activities (para. 12). However, the majority of small\nagriculture producers and entrepreneurs lack technical and market information, skills, access to\nfinancial services, and market linkages.33 They need assistance and advice on possible economic\nventures, with initial project design, appraisal, and costing; technical and financial management;\nidentification and provision of technologies; and identification of potential markets, and sources of\ntraining and information. On the other hand, opportunities for larger enterprises can be facilitated\nby  improving  linkages  with  producers,  technology,  and  financial  services.  The  Project  will\ntherefore support the establishment and expansion of a range of professional EDS in the province\nto  enable  producers  and  entrepreneurs  to  access  necessary  services,  products,  market\ninformation, and contacts in a sustainable manner.\n39. Several private sector and NGO agencies in the country have, over the last few years,\ndeveloped  core  competencies  in  this  field.  For  example,  at  the  national  level,  the  National\nAgribusiness Council supports major agribusinesses with technology and marketing linkages, and\nat the local level, SEEDS, an NGO, provides advice to microentrepreneurs. Some EDS initiatives\nhave also been supported in Southern Province by NGOs, development agencies, and a district\nchamber of commerce (Hambantota). But the work thus far, has largely been dependent on\nexternal/Government  funding or has remained limited to certain kinds of clients (various NGOs\nare providing support to very poor women for microenterprises). The Project therefore aims to\nfacilitate the development and expansion of a range of enterprise service providers, build synergy\namong them to access and share information, and create an environment for competitive and\ncosted services.\n40. A primary objective of this component will be to provide training and guidance to potential\nparticipants in the Project\u2019s credit component. Equally important will be to set up and strengthen\nenterprise development advisory units and enterprise information services, possibly patterned on\nthe Hambantota District chambers of commerce.  Other activities to be undertaken under this\ncomponent will include an inventory of potential agribusiness opportunities within the project area;\nidentification of markets and technology linkages for new and existing products; direct provision of\nadvice for larger business proposals; provision of technical support and information linkages for\nEDS providers taking part in the Project; and direct advisory support to special lending programs\nof financing institutions participating in the credit line. Entrepreneur training will be substantially\nimproved  by  incorporating  modules  on  market  linkages,  value  addition,  and  enhanced\ncompetencies (innovation, risk taking, quality, etc.)  The component will operate on the basis of\nproviding  the  full  range  of  services  to  the  new  and  existing  enterprises  to  enhance  viable\ninvestments and improve the technical and managerial efficiency of the sector.\nb.  Credit for Economic Growth\n41. The country\u2019s banking system is currently short of medium- and long-term funds to finance\nthe long-term credit needs of the MSMEs. The country has experienced a general rise in interest\nrate charges and volatility over the last several years. The main causes have been increased\n                  \n33  The TA team conducted a district stratified sample survey of 352 SMEs in the province to identify types of\nactivities,  operational  levels,  and  constraints  faced  by  them.  Most  enterprises  surveyed  were  small  (2-20\nemployees with capital investment of SLRs50,000-SLRs400,000), and most frequently reported the necessity of\naddressing problems relating to credit, followed by technology and markets, if any operational progression is\nexpected.", "12\npublic sector borrowing, balance of payments deficit, reduced rupee liquidity, and tightening of the\nmonetary policy to contain pressure on exchange rates. The Government\u2019s medium-term strategy\nto remedy this situation involves taking measures to reduce the fiscal deficit under standby\nagreements with the International Monetary Fund and issuance of long-term treasury bonds to\nstimulate the secondary market. By reducing the Government\u2019s credit demand, term financing will\nlikely be facilitated and a reliable interest rate indicator will emerge. The Project will address the\nfinancing needs of potential entrepreneurs in Southern Province and give them access to long-\nterm resources at appropriate rates and terms. Potential subprojects to be supported will be\nagriculture related; including production of high-value crops, and agricultural inputs and supplies,\nprocessing  of  fruits  and  vegetables,  processing  of  industrial  crops,  and  fish  and  livestock\nproducts; provision of agricultural services such as mechanization and irrigation; operation of\nstorage, transport, and marketing businesses; and manufacturing and services. Special focus will\nbe placed on unemployed educated youth and women with the objective of providing them with\nproductive employment opportunities.\n42. To achieve this, a credit line will be provided to finance medium- and long-term investment\nneeds of about 1,500 SMEs and about 7,000 microenterprises.  Small enterprises are defined as\nthose  with  fixed  assets,  excluding  land  and  buildings,  of  not  more  than  SLRs7  million  on\ncompletion  of  the  subproject.  Microenterprises  are  defined  as  those  having  fixed  assets,\nexcluding land and buildings, of not more than SLRs500,000 on completion of the subproject. The\nADB credit line will support 70 percent of the total subproject cost. The PFIs will contribute 10\npercent and the balance will be the contribution of the suborrower.\n43. In the absence of a market-driven benchmark interest rate for long-term investments in\nthe country (para. 41), the Project will use the AWDR as the anchor for relending to the PFIs. The\nAWDR, determined by CBSL on a monthly basis, captures an element of medium-term interest\nrates, largely reflects the average weighted costs of resources available in the banking system,\nand is therefore considered an appropriate benchmark.34 The National Development Bank (NDB)\nwill serve as the apex agency for channeling the credit line and, as done for other small and\nmicroenterprise projects, it will be given a 1 percent spread for this purpose. The 1 percent\nspread to NDB will be used, among others, to strengthen the PFIs' capacity, especially the\nNGOs, to appraise and process medium- and long-term loans to the MSMEs on a sustainable\nbasis. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk from the difference between the\nAWDR minus the 1 percent margin to NDB and the borrowing cost.\n2. Part II  Sustaining the Enabling Environment\n44.  Part II is designed to enable the provincial council and the pradeshiya sabhas (the key\ndevelopment agencies in the decentralized setup) to promote and sustain rural economic growth.\nThe major part of this component will be the provision of critical rural infrastructure and the\ndevelopment of institutional capacity in local governments to maintain it.\n45.  In the course of the past decade, a large amount of rural infrastructure has been built or\nupgraded within Southern Province through a series of externally funded projects, including the\nSPRDP and IRDPs in Matara and Hambantota. While the provision of these facilities has had\npositive impacts on the economic and welfare status of the population of the province, a serious\nproblem has emerged. All of this infrastructure, as well as the previously existing infrastructure,\nneeds to be maintained, but funds available to the provincial government and the pradeshiya\nsabhas are insufficient. As a result, much of the province's rural infrastructure is deteriorating,\n                  \n34  The AWDR is being used in other ongoing ADB-funded projects with credit components. The AWDR was 2\npercentage points higher in July  at 11.5 percent , as compared with 9.8 percent during fact-finding in May.", "13\nand if measures are not taken to improve the rural infrastructure maintenance capacity, much of\nthe benefits of past projects and key economic infrastructure will be lost.\n46. The Project therefore proposes to help arrest further deterioration of the existing rural\ninfrastructure  in  Southern  Province,  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  to\nsustainably maintain and manage infrastructure, and provide some primary rural markets in the\nproject area. This will be accomplished by (i) demonstrating low-cost and technically sound\nmaintenance standards on unclassified roads, and supporting local governments to physically\nupgrade critical rural roads to a point where recurrent maintenance costs will be minimized; (ii)\nassisting the pradeshiya sabhas to better finance infrastructure maintenance by improving their\ncapacity for financial planning, budgeting, and resource utilization; and (iii) physically upgrading\nand improving the management of selected rural markets to facilitate rural activities and increase\nlocal revenues.\n47. In addition, support will be provided for (i) project management; (ii) enhancement of SPC's\nimplementation capacity, in particular, the Department of Local Government; and (iii) institutional\nstrengthening of MPI.\na.  Capacity Building for Pradeshiya Sabhas to Maintain Rural Roads\n48. Southern Province has about 7,000 km of rural access roads. Maintenance funds are\navailable from many sources but are generally sufficient to maintain only about 25 percent of the\nroads. In addition to inadequacy of funding, most pradeshiya sabhas are often not aware of the\nneed for or mechanisms of routine infrastructure maintenance, nor are their limited technical staff\nfamiliar with cost-effective and technically sound maintenance techniques. Yet rural roads must\nbe kept passable since they are the basis for the efficient functioning of the rural economy.\nWithout such roads, farmers either will have no access to markets or will have to pay high\ntransport costs to reach them. Moreover, poor road conditions deter farmers from producing\ncommodities such as fruits, vegetables, and livestock products that could provide high returns.\nThis  component  has  thus  been  designed  to  help  overcome  some  of  the  constraints  facing\npradeshiya sabhas that have been charged with responsibility for maintaining rural roads in a\npassable condition.\n49. The first stage in this activity will involve demonstrating to the pradeshiya sabhas and their\ntechnical staff the best practices in rural road maintenance.To do this, one rural access road\napproximately 1 km in length will be developed as a demonstration road in each pradeshiya\nsabha.  These roads will be used to show (i) optimum design standards for rural roads, and (ii)\nlow-cost measures that can be taken to reduce maintenance requirements and costs.  Such\nmeasures include proper surface and side drainage, proper compaction, proper shaping, and\ntimely pothole filling. These demonstrations will be the basis for the standards set for contractors\nundertaking maintenance for the pradeshiya sabha and will also serve as examples to any private\nindividuals  or  village  communities  that  wish  to  voluntarily  undertake  maintenance  activities.\nConducting these demonstrations will also serve as a technical upgrading exercise for pradeshiya\nsabha technical staff.\n50. Upon completion of the demonstration roads, the pradeshiya sabhas will be given the\nopportunity to identify and propose key rural roads, in accordance with established selection\ncriteria satisfactory to ADB for initial upgrading and preventive maintenance works, and then to\nreceive transitional funding from the Project for maintenance, as they mobilize their own budget\nfor maintenance funding. About 30 km of the most important roads will be taken up for transitional", "14\nmaintenance funding for each pradeshiya sabha.35 Such funding will be provided on a declining\nscale such that by the end of the Project, maintenance funding will be provided entirely by the\npradeshiya sabhas. During the period of transitional maintenance funding, engineering staff of the\nDepartment of Local Government along with project-financed consultants will assist and advise\nthe pradeshiya sabhas and their technical staff on maintenance contracting, supervising, and\nensuring technically acceptable standards. Selection and design criteria for rural roads to be\ntaken up under the Project are given in Appendix 4.\n51. To fully avail of the financing provided through this component, the pradeshiya sabhas will\nneed  to  enter  into  an  agreement,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  with  SPC  to  participate  in  the  road\nupgrading and training exercise and to continue to maintain roads improved under the Project. To\nensure such compliance, improvement works in each pradeshiya sabha will be limited to 10 km\nas a first step. The balance of the work will be undertaken based on an evaluation conducted by\nthe Project Management Office (PMO) of the pradeshiya sabha\u2019s performance and compliance\nwith the commitments made under the agreement. A draft memorandum of understanding is\nshown in Appendix 5.\n b. Market Upgrading and Improvement\n52. The 92 formal markets in Southern Province and their environs provide the foremost\nproducer  marketing  channel  for  fresh  produce,  and  constitute  accumulation  points  for  the\ntransport of produce to other parts of the country. Moreover market fees constitute a major part of\nthe self-generated income of the pradeshiya sabhas. (Other revenue sources include limited\ngrants from the national and provincial governments, and local levies and taxes imposed by local\ngovernments).\n53. Most markets in the project area are poorly developed and poorly maintained, largely\nbecause of poor management. Yet they represent the most important source of direct revenue for\nthe  pradeshiya  sabhas;  this  could  be  substantially  increased  if  these  markets  were  better\ndeveloped  and  better  managed.  Once  markets  are  improved  with  better  facilities  and  or\nexpanded, the pradeshiya sabhas could charge higher fees and accommodate more lessees,\nthereby enhancing revenues for the maintenance of all infrastructure, including roads, in their\njurisdiction.\n54. According to studies undertaken by SPC, the cost of improvements required for a number\nof markets studied, varies from about $50,000 to about $400,000. The Project will thus support\nmarket development and upgrading by providing financing for market improvement, which may be\ndrawn upon by a pradeshiya sabha that meets the selection criteria satisfactory to SPC and ADB,\nand is willing to commit to improved O&M practices and continued maintenance. Selection criteria\nfor markets to be taken up by the Project are given in Appendix 6.\n55. Participation in the Project will be closely linked with the pradeshiya sabha drawing up\nplans for the sustainable operation of the market through adequate levels of user fees and\nmanagement of the facilities by a market traders association, rather than through the tendering of\nfee collection on an annual basis as is currently the practice. Market designs will be finalized in\nconsultation  with  market  users.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  help  design  market\nupgrading that best meets the needs of market users (and potential future commercial ventures).\nOn the basis of a notional average upgrading cost of $100,000 per market, $2.0 million will be\nprovided to cover 20 markets under this component.\n                  \n35  Only those rural roads linked with operable A, B, C, D, or E roads will be taken up for maintenance.", "15\nc. Financial Management Advice\n56. Given the limited funding base of the pradeshiya sabhas and their lack of experience in\naccounting, budgeting, and income generation, the pradeshiya sabhas require advice on how to\nmake best use of their financial resources and their legislated income-generating powers to fulfill\ntheir local government mandates. In many cases, opportunities for income generation do exist but\nare underutilized.36 In other cases, the pradeshiya sabha must be able to identify real priority\nactivities that must be undertaken to ensure continued or improved levels of either public welfare\nor economic activity. The provision of advice and training on sound financial management and\nresource utilization for staff and elected members of the pradeshiya sabhas will be undertaken as\nan integral part of the package of rural road and market upgrading activities.  Such advice will be\nprovided on a one-to-one basis by public finance advisers recruited under the Project.\n d. Project Management Office\n57. A professionally administered PMO is needed to coordinate and monitor project activities.\nThe PMO will need to coordinate with and contract EDS providers, coordinate with financial\ninstitutions, set up and support enterprise development and information centers, administer the\ninfrastructure component, and undertake the project implementation monitoring and evaluation\ntasks. The office facilities established for the SPRDP in Galle will be utilized for the Project.\nFunds will be provided for transportation requirements, incremental staff salaries, operational\nequipment, and materials. In addition, the Project will provide small support offices in each of the\nthree districts: Galle, Hambantota, and Matara, to coordinate and monitor the project activities at\nthe district level. Existing offices of the IRDPs in Hambantota and Matara districts will be utilized.\nFinancing will also be provided for the incremental staff equipment and materials needed by the\nDepartment of Local Government to properly supervise and implement the rural road and market\nimprovement activities to be undertaken by the Project.  Funds will be provided for training project\nstaff and staff of the Department of Local Government on subjects and activities relevant to their\nduties under the Project.\ne. Support for MPI, SPC, and the Pradeshiya Sabhas\n58. The changeover from the traditional IRDP approach to the REAP approach requires that\nMPI and SPC staff acquire new skills to facilitate and promote private sector participation, to\naddress themselves to policy and regulatory issues in sectors proposed to be promoted, and\ndevelop capacity to work and coordinate with a range of partners. The Project will assist MPI,\nSPC, and PMO to discharge these responsibilities.  For SPC and PMO, these include training in\nenterprise development, business promotion, and marketing, as well as public relations and\ninformation management. For the elected members and staff of the pradeshiya sabhas, support\nwill be provided to brief them on the intent and implementation arrangements for the Project, and\nto  guide  them  on  how  to  participate  and  benefit  to  the  maximum  extent.  This  will  be\nsupplemented  by  courses  and  seminars  in  governance,  public  management,  public\naccountability, interaction with the private sector, and development planning.  SPC will receive\nsupport to undertake special policy studies, to upgrade skills and equipment in the Department of\nLocal Government, and to strengthen and fully utilize the existing Provincial Management and\nTraining Institute at Wackwella as a venue for project-related training programs.  Some funds will\nbe provided for local and international study visits for officials of the best-performing pradeshiya\nsabhas,  enterprise  development  service  providers,  and  entrepreneurs  as  an  incentive  and\nrecognition of their performance under the Project.  At the national level, project support will be\n                  \n36  One pradeshiya sabha visited charges only SLRs135 per year for market stalls, which could well command such a\nrate on a daily basis, generating over SLRs700,000 annually from the 15 stalls available.", "16\nprovided  to  establish  and  equip  a  private  sector  promotion  and  policy  unit  under  the  MPI\nsecretary. The unit will develop strategies to enhance working relationships and coordination with\nthe private sector and to identify and pursue key policy and regulatory issues in the sector.\nC. Cost Estimates\n59.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price\ncontingencies,  is  estimated  at  $42.7  million  equivalent,  comprising  $13.2  million  in  foreign\nexchange and $29.5 million equivalent in local currency costs (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates\nare provided in Appendix 7.\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ '000)\nForeign Local Total\n             Item Exchange Currency Cost\nA.  Base Cost\n1.

Financing Plan\n60. It is proposed that ADB will provide a loan of $25 million from its Special Funds resources\nto finance about 58 percent of the total project cost. The loan will have a repayment period of 32\nyears including an 8-year grace period, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter. The loan will finance $11.2 million of the\nforeign exchange cost and $13.8 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The OPEC Fund\nwill provide $5 million to finance portions of rural roads and markets. The OPEC Fund loan will\nhave a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years, with an interest rate of 1.5", "17\npercent per annum and a service charge of 1.0 percent per annum. ADB has been asked to\nadminister  the  OPEC  Fund  loan.  The  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  about  $12.7  million\nequivalent,  will  be  met  by  other  sources  including  the  Government  ($6.7  million),  PFIs  ($2\nmillion), and beneficiaries ($4.0 million). The proposed financing plan is in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ '000)\nForeign    Local            Total\nSource Exchange Currency            Cost Percent\nADB  11,200.0     13,800.0         25,000.0 58.0\nOPEC Fund      2,000.0       3,000.0           5,000.0 12.0\nGovernment        0.0       6,700.0           6,700.0 16.0\nPFIs        0.0       2,000.0           2,000.0 5.0\nBeneficiaries        0.0       4,000.0           4,000.0 9.0\n     Total    13,200.0      29,500.0         42,700.0  100.0\nADB = Asian Development Bank, OPEC Fund = Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries Fund for International Development, PFIs = participating financial institutions.\nSource:  Mission estimates.\n61. The level of local currency for financing proposed by ADB takes into account the recent\nmacroeconomic imbalances, uncertain medium-term economic prospects, and the Government\u2019s\ninability to finance a substantial portion of the investment program required to enable Sri Lanka to\nundergo social and economic transformation and to reduce the high incidence of poverty. The\nintensified civil conflict since April 2000 has resulted in higher security-related expenditures,\nreaching 5.6 percent of GDP and the budget deficit expanding to 9.9 percent of GDP in 2000 from\n7.5 percent in 1999. Increased imports of defense-related goods, together with high oil prices,\ncaused  the  current  account  deficit  to  deteriorate  in  2000.  As  a  result,  foreign  reserves\nsubstantially declined to $1 billion at the end of 2000, and were then able to cover only 1.5\nmonths of imports.\n62. The Government is currently undertaking an economic reform program with assistance\nfrom the International Monetary Fund to stabilize macroeconomic imbalances by reducing the\noverall budget deficit to 8.5 percent in 2001 and to around 7 percent in 2002. This is supported by\nstrengthening the tax administration and collection system, curbing growth in the wage bill of\nGovernment employees, and reducing security-related spending by 1.3 percent in 2001. Despite\nthese efforts, the Government\u2019s capacity to self-finance the public investment program in the\ncoming years is expected to be limited. Therefore, continued ADB support for local cost financing\nis justified in view of prevailing difficult country circumstances and the need for a substantial\ninvestment program to successfully reduce poverty and move to a higher growth path.\nE. Executing Agency\n63. MPI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. MPI and specifically the Regional\nDevelopment Division (RDD) within it, has been responsible for implementing integrated rural\ndevelopment projects since 1979.37 RDD is headed by a director general and is  mandated by a\nCabinet decision to be the responsible coordinating agency for all regional development and\nREAPs. Block budgets for all national and externally assisted rural development projects are\n                  \n37 While the name of the ministry itself has changed several times in the past two decades, the role of RDD has\nremained more or less constant.", "18\nchanneled  through  MPI-RDD,  even  after  the  responsibility  for  implementation,  monitoring,\nsupervision, and day-to-day project management has been vested in the provincial councils.\n64. MPI-RDD has been responsible for the implementation of two ADB projects in the last\ndecade: (i) the SPRDP that closed in May 2000; and (ii) the North Central Rural Development\nProject, currently under implementation. It has functioned efficiently in implementing both the\nprojects. It is also therefore, well-versed with ADB procedures, and has a satisfactory record for\nmonitoring  project  activities,  commissioning  and  undertaking  impact  assessment,  and  in\nsubmitting progress reports and audited financial statements.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Implementing Agencies\n65. SPC is one of nine provincial councils set up under the Thirteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution and the Provincial Councils Act of 1987. It is an elected body headed by a chief\nminister (selected from the party with the majority of seats). SPC is served by a secretariat that\nhas a staff of about 1,000. The chief secretary heads the provincial administration. Devolved\nprovincial responsibilities include education, rural development, agriculture, cooperatives, and\nhealth, each of which is the responsibility of a separate department within the Secretariat and is\nheaded by a secretary. Staff turnover is not high, and therefore local knowledge and commitment\nlevels are high.38\n66. The SPRDP project office was located in the planning office of SPC, which successfully\nfulfilled its role in implementing the project. The PMO for the SPRDP is still partially in place and\nstaff experienced in implementing an ADB-financed project are available. The same applies to the\nIRDP project offices in Matara and Hambantota.  Supervising the implementation of the proposed\nProject will thus be well within the capacity of SPC, although appropriate upgrading would be\nnecessary to prepare the selected staff for the Project\u2019s increased economic and private sector\norientation.\n67. NDB  is  a  majority  privately  owned  bank  listed  on  the  Colombo  stock  exchange.\nEstablished in 1979, it has a staff of 396 and is managed by a board of 11 national and\ninternational directors. It has played a key role in providing term finance to the private sector\nespecially  for  SMEs.  NDB  is  in  the  process  of  transforming  itself  from  a  project  financing\ninstitution to a universal bank, providing one-stop banking facilities. It now has 10 branches for\nretail banking, one of which is in the project area (Matara). It set up an office in Galle, the\nprovincial capital of Southern Province at the end of 2000.\n68. NDB has strong financial fundamentals, adequate reserves, and profitability. At the end of\n2000, its total assets stood at  $416 million and annual profit at $5.6 million. Returns on assets\nand equity in the year were 1.37 percent and 9.19 percent, respectively. Its capital adequacy ratio\nat 13 percent of risk-weighted assets is well above CBSL's requirements. NDB is audited by\ninternational auditors and has been complying with all prudential regulations of CBSL. It has\nshown diligence in the management of assets, liabilities, and risks associated with its operations.\nIn addition, NDB has functioned as the apex agency for past ADB-funded SME projects, and in\nJBIC-funded projects. Its role as an apex has been consistently commended by funding agencies\nfor timely reporting, controls exercised over the PFIs, and the close dialogue maintained between\n                  \n38  The current chief secretary has been in this position for the last seven years and has been a very active participant\nin the project preparation process.", "19\nfunding agencies and the PFIs. NDB performance and financial fundamentals therefore support\nits selection as the apex unit for the Project.\n2. Project Organization and Management\n69. The project's organization chart is shown in Appendix 8. MPI will be responsible for\nbudgeting, ensuring timely and smooth flow of funds to the provincial council and NDB, for overall\nmonitoring  of  implementation  progress,  interministerial  and/or  development  assistance\ncoordination for project activities, policy advice and guidance to SPC and NDB, and resolution of\nany issues or disputes that may arise during implementation.\n70. SPC and NDB will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the Project. SPC\nwill be responsible for overall implementation and coordination of the project components working\nthrough the PMO to be established in the administrative headquarters of Southern Province in\nGalle. For Part I of the Project, SPC will select and contract, on terms satisfactory to ADB,\nreputable and experienced enterprise development service and training providers; and develop\nan acceptable work plan with the service providers and PFIs to address the Project's objective,\nand oversee its implementation. In addition SPC will be responsible for the implementation and\nsupervision of Part II of the Project, including the recruitment and supervision of consulting\nservices and coordination, and liaison with the participating pradeshiya sabhas. SPC will enter\ninto an agreement with each participating pradeshiya sabha, satisfactory to ADB, governing the\nparticipation of the pradeshiya sabha in Part II of the Project. Actual implementation of the rural\nroad maintenance activities and market infrastructure upgrading will be undertaken by the local\npradeshiya sabhas under the technical guidance of the Department of Local Government.\n71. NDB will be responsible for supervising the financial services component of Part I of the\nProject, which will be undertaken by the PFIs, and for the training of PFI staff.\n72. Three committees will oversee and supervise project implementation. At the national level,\na national coordination committee will be established under the MPI secretary and will consist\namong others, of the chief secretary of SPC, the project director, the lead EDS technical support\nprovider  and    representatives  of  the  Department  of  External  Resources,  National  Planning\nDepartment, NDB, national chambers of commerce, and the private sector. This committee will\nbe responsible for (i) addressing issues referred to it by the provincial advisory committee and the\nproject management committee, (ii) reviewing the progress of project implementation, and (iii)\ncoordinating among and between participating agencies in the Project.\n73.  At the provincial level, a provincial advisory committee will be chaired by the chief\nsecretary of SPC, and include the project director, a representative of NDB, professionals from\nRuhuna University, representatives from the regional and district chambers of commerce, the\nthree district secretaries, and the regional manager of CBSL at Matara. This committee will be\nresponsible for providing advice and guidance to the PMO and act as a think tank to provide\nsuggestions on maximizing the role of the private sector, mobilizing the pradeshiya sabhas and\nidentifying new investment opportunities as well as enterprise support requirements.\n74. A  project  management  committee  will  be  established  under  the  chief  secretary  of\nSouthern Province and include the project director (as secretary), representatives of NDB and all\nPFIs,  the  commissioner  for  local  government,  the  lead  EDS  technical  support  provider,\nrepresentatives from other contracted service providers, and the three district directors. This\ncommittee will act as the steering committee for the Project and will be responsible for discussing\nand resolving all project-related issues, approving the annual work plan and periodically reviewing", "20\nproject progress. It shall also coordinate project activities with other national and provincial level\nprograms, avoid duplication of effort with other programs and projects, and identify any gaps in\nterms of services, information supply, and technology.\n3.  Project Management Office\n75.  The PMO put in place for the SPRDP will be revamped for the Project and will have five\nunits: (i) EDS technical support; (ii) infrastructure; (iii) budget, finance, and accounts; (iv) training\nand administration; and (v) monitoring and evaluation.  It will be headed by a suitably qualified\nfull-time project director acceptable to ADB, who will be selected and appointed in accordance\nwith the Government\u2019s procedures for recruitment of project staff for foreign-assisted projects.\nThe project director will be assisted by an adequate number of suitably qualified personnel to\nhead and staff the other units, also in accordance with the aforementioned procedures. The\nproject director will have sufficient authority and rank to perform the required functions of the post\nand be responsible for implementing, coordinating, and monitoring of all components of the\nProject. Specific functions include: (i) preparing the annual work program and drafting budget for\nthe Project; (ii) contracting and supervising agencies selected to provide enterprise development\nadvisory services; (iii) contracting and administering consulting services and training including the\npreparation of a training program; (iv) supervising and monitoring all procurement of equipment\nand  civil  works  contracts;  (v)  implementing,  monitoring,  including  liaising  with  the  PFIs;  (vi)\nsupervising and coordinating project benefit monitoring; and (vii) liaising with ADB including the\nsubmission of withdrawal applications and periodic progress reports. The three district offices,\nfunctioning under the direction of the project director, will deal with local coordination issues and\nmonitor the implementation of project activities. All project staff will be given sufficient orientation\ntraining  in  the  new  concepts  being  introduced  by  the  Project,  especially  private  sector\nparticipation.\n4. Specific Implementation Arrangements\na. Part  I\ni. Enterprise Development Support and Training\n76.  The PMO will contract, prior to loan effectiveness, a private sector partner that possesses\nadequate background and experience in supporting enterprise development in the agriculture\nsector, has linkages with the agribusiness community, and is willing to provide technical support\nto the project office for the duration of the Project. The partner will be housed in the PMO and\nfunction as the private sector technical arm of the PMO. It will support the PMO in (i) undertaking\nindustry  and  sector  surveys  to  identify  market  opportunities  and  the  region's  competitive\nadvantages; (ii) disseminating information; (iii) establishing linkages and networks for accessing\ninformation,  technologies,  and  markets;  and  (iv)  building  up  indigenous  capacity  to  provide\nenterprise development services on a sustainable basis. Terms of reference for the lead EDS\ntechnical support provider in the PMO are provided in Appendix 9.\n77. Some consulting support will be provided to assist the PMO in determining mutually\nagreeable target groups, achievement indicators, and work programs, and negotiating fees and\ncontracts with EDS providers. In negotiating contracts, the intent that the provision of services\nshould ultimately be self-financing and self-sustaining will be kept in view, and services that could\nbe charged for will be investigated. Contracts will be in two forms, in each case satisfactory to\nADB, including a retainer contract in which an agreement is entered into by PMO and the agency\nconcerned that it will provide services for the Project for a certain period at a particular rate, and a", "21\ncontract for specific identified activities. The latter may entail adaptive research, specialized\ntraining, study tours, market development activities, or specialized consultancies depending on\nthe identified needs that emerge during project implementation. Each EDS provider will develop\nan annual work plan satisfactory to ADB.\nii. Financial Services\n78. NDB will serve as the apex agency for the provision of the Project's credit line. Its\nperformance and financial fundamentals were assessed. The credit component will be provided\nby the Government to NDB under a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB.  As the apex\nagency, NDB will (i) review and approve subloan applications from the PFIs for eligibility and\ncommercial viability, (ii) disburse loan proceeds, (iii) supervise the enterprise financing activities\nof the PFIs, (iv) compile and evaluate data on project progress; (v) provide training on enterprise\nfinancing to PFI staff; (vi) ensure PFI compliance with CBSL and Ministry of Finance guidelines;\nand (vii) coordinate with the Government and ADB for effective project implementation.\n79.  Eligibility criteria have been  developed and agreed to guide the selection of PFIs under\nthe  Project.  Financial  institutions  with  branch  networks  in  the  project  area,  experience  with\nlending to MSMEs and quality of MSME portfolio were extensively assessed, and the following\nwere  identified  as  PFIs:  Hatton  National  Bank,  NDB,  Development  Finance  Corporation  of\nCeylon, Seylan Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Bank of Ceylon, Ruhuna Development Bank,\nand  SEEDS.  Each  PFI  will  be  required  to  enter  into  a  participation  agreement  with  NDB,\nsatisfactory to ADB, and will be subject to monitoring both by NDB and PMO. The eligibility\ncriteria for PFI selection is in Appendix 10.\n80.  As the administrator and manager of the credit line, NDB will receive funds from the\nGovernment  at  AWDR  minus  1  percent  for  onlending  to  the  PFIs.  The  PFIs  will  add  their\ntransaction cost (currently ranging from 5.5 percent to 7 percent) to the AWDR and onlend to end\nborrowers. The maximum subproject size is pegged at SLRs7 million for small enterprises and\nSLRs500,000  for  microenterprises.  Since  many  NGOs  and  other  government  programs  are\nalready providing  small loans (SLRs30,000 and below) to the poor in rural areas and because\nthe Project is aiming at generating economic activity and scaling up microenterprises, a minimum\nloan  ceiling  is  set  at  SLRs40,000  to  target  viable  investments  and  to  minimize  substitution\npossibilities. The maximum maturity of subloans (7 years) is fixed, based on the utilization of the\ncredit line under the SME assistance project.39 Lending for subprojects will be collateral based\nand  all  credit  risks  will  be  borne  by  the  PFIs.  NDB  and  the  PFIs  will  be  financed  on  a\nreimbursable basis. NDB will submit quarterly reports to the PMO and ADB on the overall credit\nactivities, including details on net approvals, disbursements, collection ratio, the characteristics of\nSME borrowers, and the impact of subprojects. Further details on financing arrangements are\nprovided in a supplementary appendix, which is available on request.\n81. To ensure that subborrowers have the necessary skills, information, technology, and\nmarketing links, the Project provides an additional tier of scrutiny.  All borrowers will be required\nto route their proposals to the PFIs through selected EDS providers and to seek guidance, as\nnecessary, prior to applying for loans. This requirement will be validated by NDB when refinance\nis sought for such subloans by the PFIs. SEEDS, as the NGO PFI, combines its credit package\nwith enterprise development service to clients. As such, SEEDS, and not the EDS provider, will\nbe required to ensure and certify that clients have acquired the necessary skills, training, and\nmarket linkages for managing their enterprises. However, all PFIs retain the right to approve or\n                  \n39  Eighty-four percent of total subprojects under this project were for a maturity period of 3-5 years, 12 percent  for 5-\n7 years, and 4 percent for 7-10 years.", "22\ndisapprove any loan application depending on their independent assessment and will advise\nPMO accordingly.\niii. Revolving Fund\n82. Within one year after the ADB loan becomes effective, NDB will establish a revolving fund\nto credit interest payments and principal repayment by the PFIs under the Project. The resources\nof the revolving fund will be utilized for second generation loans for eligible subprojects and\namortization of loans received from the Government. NDB will operate the revolving fund for 15\nyears. The revolving fund will be audited by independent auditors to assess the inflow and outflow\nof resources, and the application of funds.\niv. Training of PFI Staff\n83. Training and orientation will be provided by NDB for PFI staff on EDS operations under\nthe Project and on investment appraisal and risk analysis, working capital management, asset\nand liability management, and product development and marketing. Necessary curriculum and\nmaterials acceptable to ADB will be developed especially for NGO-PFIs by NDB. Training will\ninclude  classroom  and  case-study  materials  and  approaches  as  well  as  exposure  visits  to\nborrowers and their businesses. Refresher training will be provided as course follow-up. The\nrelated costs will be covered by NDB from the spread it receives under the Project. NDB will also\ngive recognition awards to best performing PFIs under the Project.\nb. Part II\n84. SPC, as the Implementing Agency for Part II, will work through the PMO, which in turn will\nwork closely with the Department of Local Government. At the inception of the Project, staff of the\nDepartment of Local Government will contact each pradeshiya sabha to explain the Project and\ntheir role in it. Road maintenance demonstrations will be prepared on selected demonstration\nroads (approximately 1 km in length) in each pradeshiya sabha with assistance from project\nconsultants and under the supervision of the Department of Local Government. SPC will ensure\nthat the technical staff of the pradeshiya sabha are  fully involved in this process.\n85. Each pradeshiya sabha will then be given the option to participate in initial upgrading and\nmaintenance of about 30 km of roads, provided they agree to abide by the agreed road selection\ncriteria, are willing to participate in the financial capacity development program and are able to\ndemonstrate their commitment and ability to improve their annual financing for infrastructure\nmaintenance  over  a  four-year  period.  During  the  first  year,  upgrading  and  preventive\nmaintenance will be undertaken to ensure lower subsequent maintenance costs. The amount\nallocated for the first year of upgrading will thus be SLRs750,000 per km, financed fully by the\nProject. From year two, SLRs75,000 per km/year is budgeted for annual maintenance.  This will\nbe shared by the pradeshiya sabha and the Project on the following basis: year 2:  Project 75\npercent,  pradeshiya sabha 25 percent; year 3: Project 50 percent, pradeshiya sabha 50 percent;\nyear 4: Project 25 percent, pradeshiya sabha 75 percent; year 5 and subsequently: pradeshiya\nsabha 100 percent.\n86. To  qualify  for  financing  and  TA,  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  will  enter  into  individual\nparticipation agreements with SPC, within three months of loan effectiveness and satisfactory to\nADB, setting out the terms of their participation, including the agreement to provide the required\ncounterpart costs. The Government will ensure that at least one month prior to the end of each\nproject  year  in  which  road  maintenance  funding  will  be  provided,  each  pradeshiya  sabha", "23\ndemonstrates, to the satisfaction of ADB, that it has budgeted the full amount of the required\ncontribution to road maintenance for the upcoming project year and has the capacity to manage\nthe funds. Each pradeshiya sabha will prepare and present an annual action plan along with the\nexpected annual budget allocation, prior to disbursement of any funds to them. In addition, prior\nto approving preventive maintenance funding beyond 10 km of roads, the PMO will undertake a\nfull review of the technical and financial capacity of the pradeshiya sabhas and their budgetary\nallocation to O&M of roads. Further funding will be contingent on each individual pradeshiya\nsabha abiding by the terms and agreements contained in the participation agreement and their\nperformance evaluation.\n87.  Similarly, pradeshiya sabhas wanting to improve their market facilities can file a request\nwith  the  PMO,  specifying  improvements  planned,  and  how  the  market  management  and\nmaintenance will be undertaken once the improvements are completed.  Solid and liquid waste\ndisposal plans will also be required. Advice will be provided on market design and market\nmanagement  by  the  Department  of  Local  Government  staff  in  consultation  with  project\nconsultants. Prior to the final decision to design and construct a particular market, the pradeshiya\nsabha concerned will agree to prepare a market management plan and formulate a financing\nstructure  that    would  allow  the  market  to  operate  on  a  sustainable  basis  with  maximized\nrevenues.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  pradeshiya  sabha  in  preparing  the  market\nmanagement and financing plans and designing the physical structure and layout of the market\nimprovements.  The market design and layout will avoid standard, replicated design, and will be\ndeveloped in consultation with market users, focusing on providing facilities to stimulate and\ncomplement the economic base of the market service area.  The selected pradeshiya sabhas will\nenter into participation agreements with SPC satisfactory to ADB within three months of loan\neffectiveness,  setting  out  the  terms  of  their  agreement,  including  the  agreement  to  provide\ncounterpart funds. Construction will be undertaken on a contract basis under the supervision of\nthe Department of Local Government in cooperation with the technical staff of the pradeshiya\nsabha. A draft memorandum of understanding is placed in Appendix 11.\n5. Implementation Schedule\n88. The Project contains several innovative components that require time to set up and\norganize before full-scale implementation can proceed. In addition, several of the components\nhave a strong institution-building focus and their start-up will require the initial recruitment of\ndomestic and international consultants. With this in view, the Project will be implemented over six\nyears  with  the  first  year  primarily  focused  on  the  following  activities:  recruiting  staff  and\nconsultants; undertaking initial, benchmark, and investment surveys to delineate specific potential\nenterprises to be promoted; contracting service providers, establishing enterprise development\nand information centers; undertaking consultation work with the pradeshiya sabhas; finalizing the\nmemorandums of understanding; and constructing demonstration roads. Some borrowing from\nthe credit line could be expected by the beginning of the second year, but full-scale operation of\nthe credit line and advisory services, as well as preventive maintenance works under Part II are\nlikely to commence only in the second year. If the preparatory functions envisaged are completed\nahead  of  schedule,  the  delivery  of  project  inputs  could  be  accordingly  brought  forward  in\nconsultation with ADB. ADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of consultants. The\nGovernment has been advised that such advance action does not commit ADB to finance any\npart of the Project. A tentative implementation schedule is given in Appendix 12.", "24\n6. Procurement\n89. Goods and services financed by ADB and the OPEC Fund will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  In addition, the Project will implement the Government\u2019s\nRevised Guidelines on Tender Procedures for Foreign Assisted Projects, including compliance\nwith the delegation of administrative authority to different levels, to the extent that such guidelines\ndo not conflict with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Under Part I, the major items to be\nprocured for the enterprise development service providers will be equipment and materials, which\nwill be procured by the PMO. For procurement of goods and services to be financed under the\ncredit component, NDB will demonstrate to ADB that the procurement procedures adopted by\nsubborrowers are appropriate in the circumstances and will ensure that the goods and services to\nbe financed by the credit component subloans are purchased at reasonable prices, account being\ntaken  of  relevant  factors  such  as  time  of  delivery,  efficiency  and  reliability  of  goods,  their\nsuitability to the subproject, and the availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts and in\nthe case of services, of their quality and the competence of the parties rendering them.\n90. For Part II, the major goods and services to be procured will be equipment and materials\nas  well  as  a  modest  amount  of  civil  works.  Equipment  will  consist  of  office,  information\ntechnology,  communications,  and  training  equipment  for  the  PMO,  Department  of  Local\nGovernment, and selected enterprise development agencies. A small number of vehicles will be\nprocured  to  allow  mobility  in  the  field  for  staff,  service  contractors,  and  consultants.  As  all\ncontracts for goods and services, except for vehicles, are expected to be $100,000 or less,\nprocurement may be through direct purchase. Contracts for goods and services in excess of\n$100,000 will be procured through local competitive bidding.\n91. Civil works contracts to be awarded will consist of routine road maintenance works and\nmarket  upgrading  under  Part  II.  Procurement  will  comprise  many  small  contracts  for  road\nmaintenance and for the construction of market facilities. No single contract is likely to exceed\n$200,000. The procurement of civil works for road maintenance contracts will take a variety of\nforms, and may entail a full package contract, the rental of equipment along with the use of hired\nlabor, or the use of hired labor, with the pradeshiya sabhas\u2019 own equipment. The procurement of\nsuch small-scale contracts will be in accordance with local competitive bidding using procedures\nacceptable to ADB, or on a case-by-case basis acceptable to ADB, the use of local direct\npurchase or other practices that have been shown to be acceptable to ADB. Such acceptability\nmay entail open bidding and competition, or, in the event this is not realistically possible, the use\nof Southern Province Road Development Authority equipment on a contracted basis. Civil works\nfor market improvement will be awarded through local competitive bidding using procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n92. Vehicles and equipment will be procured through international shopping for packages\ncosting more than $100,000 and less than $500,000, and by direct purchase for packages costing\n$100,000 or less. Service contracts for enterprise training will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive bidding among prequalified agencies using ADB guidelines. Service contracts for\nenterprise development services will be through direct purchase, negotiated on the basis of\npreselection of the service providers and with payment of standard fees. An indicative list of\nprocurement packages showing size and method of procurement is provided in Appendix 13.\n7. Consulting Services\n93. The Project will require 246 person-months of consulting services consisting of 36 person-\nmonths of international and 210 person-months of domestic expert services. The consultants will", "25\n(i) help formulate work programs for the agencies and intermittent supervision of the agencies\u2019\nwork; (ii) assist the pradeshiya sabhas and the PMO with the selection of markets for upgrading\nand rural infrastructure to be covered by the rural infrastructure component; (iii) help with market\ndesign  and  market  management;  (iv)  provide  training  to  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  staff  on\nsustainable  management  and  financing  of  rural  infrastructure;  (v)  design  an  overall  training\nprogram for staff of the PMO, pradeshiya sabhas, and the contracted enterprise development\nagencies on the identification and promotion of economic opportunities in rural areas; and (vi)\nprepare environmental guidelines for project implementation and monitor compliance. A tentative\nlist  of  consulting  services  requirements  and  proposed  terms  of  reference  are  provided  in\nAppendix 14.\n94. In  addition  to  direct  consulting  services,  the  Project  provides  that  service  contracts,\nsatisfactory to ADB, will be entered into between SPC and qualified enterprise development\nagencies for the provision of enterprise development advisory services aimed at the promotion of\ngrowth-oriented activities linked with the Project\u2019s credit line.  Procurement of services from the\nenterprise development agencies will take the form of service contracts satisfactory to ADB. The\nservices of the lead EDS technical support provider will be rendered under a technical services\ncontract, for the term of project implementation, satisfactory to ADB. The selection of the lead\nEDS technical support provider will be made through an objective and transparent process,\nsatisfactory to ADB, based on an institutional and technical capability assessment with special\nreference to the needs of the Project. Some of the factors to be considered will be the agency\u2019s\nmandate and background in agriculture-related enterprise promotion; national level linkages with\nrelevant private sector agribusinesses, associations, and technology and marketing experts; and\nwillingness to take up the responsibility envisaged in the proposed terms of reference for the\nduration of the Project. The selection process will be concluded and an agreement between MPI,\nSPC, and the selected agency, satisfactory to ADB, will be signed prior to loan effectiveness.\n95. All consulting services, including those financed by the OPEC Fund will be engaged in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Consulting services will be\nrecruited  in  three  packages:  enterprise  development,  rural  roads,  and  public  finance\nmanagement. Consultants, both domestic and international, for EDS support and rural roads will\nbe recruited through a firm. Other consultants, because of the nature of expertise required, will be\nrecruited as individual consultants. To expedite the appointment of consultants, the Government\nhas indicated that it will undertake advance action to the stage of shortlisting during the project\nprocessing period.\n8. Training\n96. Training will be provided for (i) staff of the PFIs on credit promotion and subproject\nappraisal, (ii) potential beneficiaries on technical and financial management, (iii) staff of the PMO\non enterprise development, (iv) staff of the Department of Local Government on rural road\nmaintenance techniques, and (v)  pradeshiya sabhas on rural infrastructure maintenance and\npublic finance and administration. PFI training will be undertaken at a suitable in-country training\ninstitute and will consist of a series of short courses throughout the project period. For Part I,\nproposals for training from the enterprise development advisory agencies will be assessed by the\nPMO and appropriate financing approved by the project director.  In addition, SPC will formulate a\nplan for the training institute\u2019s full utilization, including its long-term financial sustainability.\n97. Three  of  the  project\u2019s  components  will  entail  major  training  activities:  the  enterprise\ndevelopment component of Part I, the rural roads maintenance component of Part II, and the", "26\npradeshiya sabha financial management advisory component of Part II. Under the enterprise\ndevelopment component, service providers, NGOs, and training institutes will be recruited on a\ncontract basis to provide training to prospective entrepreneurs interested in availing of the project\ncredit line. Such training will entail specialized training in identified fields including cultivation\ntechniques for high-value crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and spices, for livestock and poultry,\nand for improved product packaging and marketing. More generic training on preparing project\nreports and business plans, and business and financial management will be provided. Special\nmodules for women and youth to generate awareness of business opportunities and potential in\nthe project area will be formulated and provided. Training courses under this component will be\narranged and financed on the basis of perceived demand by the PMO's enterprise development\nwing.\n98. Much  of  the  effort  expended  under  the  rural  roads  maintenance  component  will  be\ndevoted to on-the-job training of the technical staff of the pradeshiya sabhas.  This will include the\npreparation of the demonstration roads in each pradeshiya sabha under the guidance of road\nmaintenance consultants, and initial upgrading of roads and initial maintenance of improved\nroads under the guidance of the technical staff of the Department of Local Government. The\nfinancial and management officers of the pradeshiya sabhas will receive direct on-the-job training\nin finance, budgeting, and management planning from the consultants recruited for the financial\nmanagement advisory component of Part II. This will include training in assessing expenditure\nrequirements, prioritizing expenditure requirements, assessing revenue sources, and maximizing\nsuch  sources  and  planning  activities  based  on  available  expenditures  and  prioritized\nrequirements.  General training in governance and management for the elected officials of the\npradeshiya sabhas is included in the project scope.\n99. Training will also be provided on (i) credit promotion and subproject appraisal for PFI staff;\n(ii)  enterprise  development,  business  promotion,  and  marketing  for  relevant  PMO  staff;  (iii)\ntechniques of rural road management for technical staff of the Department of Local Government;\nand (iv) the latest techniques in project benefit monitoring and evaluation, especially tools for\nimpact assessment for the project staff including district offices. The PMO will have a full-time\ntraining officer to coordinate and advise on training activities. In addition, support will be provided\nto  equip  the  Wackwella  Training  Institute  constructed  under  the  SPRDP,  so  that  it  can  be\neffectively used as a venue for project-sponsored training activities. SPC will (i) formulate a plan\nfor the Institute's full utilization, including its long-term financial sustainability, and (ii) monitor its\nimplementation.\n9. Operation and Maintenance\n100. As the Project is largely credit based and will, to a considerable extent, use existing\nfacilities or services, large incremental O&M costs are not envisaged. The main public sector\nO&M costs will be for the operation of the PMO during project implementation, for the operation of\nany  market  facilities  upgraded  by  the  Project,  and  for  infrastructure  undergoing  transitional\nmaintenance.  These costs will be financed as follows:\n(i) The O&M costs for the PMO will be financed from project funds for the project\nduration after which the PMO will be phased out.\n(ii) O&M costs and arrangements for market facilities will be covered as part of the\nmarket development plan that must be prepared by each participating pradeshiya\nsabha prior to any market infrastructure being taken up for financing. The plan\nmust include assurances that adequate revenues from the market turnover tax will", "27\nbe allocated for market maintenance. Market management and maintenance will\nbe  the  responsibility  of  a  market  committee  made  up  of  representatives  of\nstallholders, clients, and the local government council.\n(iii) O&M for infrastructure covered by Part II will be financed from project funds on a\ndeclining scale during the four-year period with the pradeshiya sabhas devising\nlong-term O&M procedures and taking on an ever increasing share of the cost as\nthe project proceeds.\n101. For O&M of facilities and activities of private sector project agencies, the operational cost\nof the enterprise development services will be built into the contracts with the service agencies,\nand the operational costs for the PFIs will be funded from their normal overhead.\n10.  Sustainability\n102. Fostering sustainability of the project impact and the facilities and services provided by the\nProject is at the core of the project design.  While the EDS will initially be financed on a contract\nbasis by the Project, the ultimate goal by the end of the project period is to make such services\navailable on a self-financing sustainable basis. Similarly, improvements of market facilities will\nonly be taken up if a sustainable management system is formulated. Market maintenance costs\nwill be borne by the private sector users of the market facilities.\n103. The whole objective of the rural roads maintenance capacity strengthening is to assist the\npradeshiya sabhas to utilize their available funds more effectively and to maximize funding for the\noperation of key rural infrastructure under their jurisdiction. By the end of the project period, most\nof the pradeshiya sabhas, with the assistance of consulting services, are expected to have\ndeveloped long-term O&M procedures and sustainable sources of funds to finance the most\ncritical roads under their jurisdiction. For the longer term, the national and provincial governments\nhave come to realize the importance of increased maintenance allocations for the pradeshiya\nsabhas. To this end, SPC has just completed an inventory of all roads under the pradeshiya\nsabhas' responsibility to begin estimating and budgeting incremental maintenance requirements.   \n11. Beneficiary Participation\n104. The Project is designed to be demand driven and participatory, especially Part I. It will be\nthe role of the EDS to identify and promote key promising ventures, while at the same time\nliaising with the PFIs for implementation of the credit line, and the option of owners or potential\nowners of micro and small enterprises to avail of the EDS, training, or credit line. In this context,\naccess to the credit line will be as much for existing entrepreneurs who wish to increase the size\nand  level  of  investment  in  their  enterprises  as  for  new  potential  start-ups.  Interested\nentrepreneurs will be provided with access to information on technology, markets, and financing,\nand  also to customized or group training, all at their own initiative.\n105. Beneficiary participation is also inherent in the design of Part II. In this case the direct\nbeneficiaries  will  be  the  pradeshiya  sabhas,  which  are  the  driving  force  in  deciding  which\ninfrastructure facilities are taken up for upgrading or transitional maintenance, and which will\nreceive capacity-building support. The indirect beneficiaries will be the local population who the\npradeshiya  sabhas  represent  and  who  will  benefit  from  the  improved  market  and  transport\ninfrastructure.", "28\n12. Disbursement Procedures\n106. The Government will ensure that full budgetary allocations for the Project are made\nannually by MPI. To ensure timely release of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to\nexpedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  becomes\neffective, establish two imprest accounts in CBSL; one for the credit component and one for all\nother components of the project. The initial amount to be deposited in each imprest account will\nnot exceed $1.0 million equivalent. Payments will be made from and to these accounts for all\neligible expenditures under the Project. The imprest accounts shall be established, managed,\nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s\nstatement of expenditure procedure will be used to replenish and liquidate the imprest accounts,\nand  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures.  A  ceiling  of  $50,000  equivalent  will  be  placed  per\nindividual payment/expenditure. Disbursements to NDB and from NDB to the PFIs will be made\non  a  reimbursement  basis  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the\nGovernment and NDB and the participation agreement to be entered into by NDB and each PFI.\n13. Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n107. Each  agency  involved  in  project  implementation  will  establish  and  maintain  detailed\naccounts  and  records  of  project  progress  and  expenditures  to  facilitate  the  identification  of\nincome and expenditures related to the Project. These will include the enterprise development\nservice  agencies,  PMO,  PFIs,  and  the  participating  pradeshiya  sabhas.  The  PMO  will  be\nresponsible for consolidating all accounts except those relating to the credit line, and submitting\nreimbursement  requests  to  ADB.  Adequate  accounting  staff,  including  two  full-time  project\naccountants  within  the  PMO  will  be  dedicated  solely  to  monitoring  project  expenses,\nreimbursements,  and  accounts.  NDB  will  be  responsible  for  accounts  and  requests  for\nreimbursement relating to the credit line; it will establish a separate project cell in its head office to\nmaintain detailed records on the use of loan proceeds. Accounts of NDB and the PFIs will be\naudited annually by independent auditors. All audited accounts and financial statements together\nwith the report of the auditor will be submitted to ADB within six months of the close of the related\nfinancial  year.  Action  will  be  taken  by  ADB  under  its  administrative  instructions,  Project\nAdministration Instruction (PAI), section 7.05, in cases of any delays in the submission of audited\nproject accounts and financial statements by the parties concerned. The imprest account and\nstatement of expenditures will be audited as part of the regular annual audit of the project\naccounts, and a separate opinion on their use will be required in the annual audit report.\n108. Each  project  agency  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports,  which  the  PMO  will\nconsolidate  into  project  reports.  The  reports  will  detail  the  achievements  related  to  the\nimplementation schedule, targets and plans for the next reporting period, problems requiring\nresolution, and steps to be taken to resolve them. NDB will submit quarterly progress reports to\nthe PMO on the progress of its part of the Project. The report will be an aggregation of the PFIs'\nquarterly reports, which will cover staffing, training, lending, collection, arrears performance,\nportfolio data, subborrowers and enterprise characteristics, and impact of subprojects. In its\nfinancial statements NDB will segregate ADB loan proceeds from its own statements and from\nother ongoing projects, and present separate statements for the Project.\n109. Within three months of project closing, RDD of MPI will prepare a project completion\nreport for submission to ADB. The report will detail the results and achievements of the Project\nincluding an impact assessment, provide an analysis of the funds spent, and indicate measures\nto ensure the sustainability of project investments.", "29\n14. Benefit Monitoring\n110. Benefit monitoring of the project impact will be undertaken by the monitoring unit to be set\nup in the PMO. Initial activities will include a benchmark survey to be undertaken during the first\nyear of the Project. Thereafter monitoring activities for the enterprise development services and\nthe credit line will be undertaken on a focused basis, concentrating on selected individuals,\nincluding women, who use these facilities. This will consist of annual interviews of randomly\nselected clients and subborrowers to determine the nature of advice received from enterprise\ndevelopment agencies and their opinion of it, the type of training received if any, and its perceived\nvalue; the type and scale of enterprise taken up for financing, the amount of the credit line drawn\ndown, and their experience in dealing with the PFIs; and the results of the ensuing investment,\nand the amount and type of employment generated. The focus will move from activity monitoring\nto impact monitoring.\n111. Monitoring of Part II will consist of inspections of the roads being maintained by the\npradeshiya sabhas, and annual interviews of people within the service area of the roads, and\nmarket  lessees  and  users  to  determine  economic  and  social  benefits  of  infrastructure\nimprovement and maintenance.\n15. Midterm Review\n112. A comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken at the end of the third year of project\nimplementation. The purpose of the review will be to critically evaluate the project progress, the\nvalidity of the implementation procedures, the functioning and impact of the EDS, the impact of\ntraining activities, the rate of uptake of the credit line, and the impact of Part II on infrastructure\nmaintenance  by  the  pradeshiya  sabhas.    Recommendations  will  be  made,  as  required  for\nchanges in focus, adjustments to contracts and implementation arrangements, and selection or\nqualification  procedures  for  access  to  the  credit  line  by  entrepreneurs  or  access  to  the\ninfrastructure component by pradeshiya sabhas.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n113.  Any  potential  environmental  impacts  of  subprojects  financed  by  the  credit  line  are\nexpected to be small and scattered, given the small-scale nature of the enterprises concerned\nand their likely dispersion throughout the project area.  Localized problems of liquid and solid\nwaste disposal, as well as noise and dust may, however, arise. To address these and any other\nproblems that may arise, the Project provides for a domestic environment consultant in the PMO,\nwho will support the contracted EDS providers to make an environmental impact assessment of\nthe  different  types  of  enterprises  identified  for  promotion  under  the  Project.  To  ensure  that\nsubproject  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  are  prepared  properly  and  that  the\nenvironmental review mechanism is adequately functioning, a sample of the first set of subproject\nIEEs will be submitted by the PMO to ADB for review. Any subprojects in which the IEE identifies\nsignificant environmental impacts will also be required to be submitted to ADB for review and\nappraisal. The EDS providers and the PMO will undertake programs to create awareness and\nunderstanding of general and specific environmental concerns in the region. In addition, the\nenvironmental consultant will prepare environmental guidelines for the PFIs to apply during the\nreview of subloan applications and for subborrowers to follow during the setup and operation of\ntheir enterprises.", "30\n114.  The works involved in rural roads will be simple maintenance works and no serious\nenvironmental impacts are envisaged. Indeed by continuing to maintain rural roads in an operable\ncondition the component will have a positive environmental effect by preventing sheet erosion\nand gullying, and the consequent siltation of adjacent water bodies. In the case of market\nupgrading, some noise, dust, and disturbance may be experienced for a short temporary period\nwhile the upgrading works are under way. Once completed to an improved design, the state of\nthe market site itself will be improved, with better drainage and traffic movement. Solid and liquid\nwaste disposal are potential problems that will need to be dealt with through the plans to be\nprepared by participating pradeshiya sabhas and submitted to SPC as a requirement in the\napproval  process.  To  increase  the  positive  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  rural  road\ndesigns promoted by the demonstration roads and preventive maintenance works under Part II\nwill incorporate environmentally sound practices. The environment consultant will also formulate\nappropriate guidelines for the infrastructure component. This activity will be undertaken in the first\nyear of the Project, so that technical agencies are made aware of any special environmental\nconsiderations in the implementation of project activities.\n2. Social  Concerns\n115. The Project aims to create or expand around 7,000 agro-based microenterprises and about\n1,500 SMEs with a corresponding increase in employment estimated for about 25,000 people. By\ngenerating employment and upgrading business opportunities, the Project will address the key\nconsumption poverty issues exemplified by the lack of economic opportunities. Some of the poor\nwill benefit directly by becoming microentrepreneurs. The beneficiaries of the Project will range\nfrom the economically disadvantaged poor to higher income groups in Southern Province. The\nincrease in the number of entrepreneurs will also generally improve the terms of trade for poor\nagricultural producers.\n116. A  number  of  activities  will  be  undertaken  to  enhance  benefits  to  vulnerable  groups,\nparticularly  unemployed  youth  and  women.  Special  consideration  will  be  given  for  the  full\nparticipation of female entrepreneurs, and women will be specially targeted to participate as\nequals in the business arena. Youth are somewhat reluctant to engage in business, and efforts by\ngrassroots NGOs have only been partly successful. A provincewide promotional campaign is\ntherefore planned to introduce youth to enterprise opportunities and to business as a career\nthrough  NGOs,  chambers  of  commerce,  and  the  EDS  providers.  Women\u2019s  participation  in\nmicrocredit and microenterprise programs, on the other hand, has been very high, but women\nneed higher levels of credit, business counseling, and other support services to move up from\nmicro  to  small  and  from  small  to  medium-sized  enterprises.  In  addition,  gender  awareness\nprograms for bankers, service providers, and clients will help overcome some of the sociocultural\nconstraints that are hampering women entrepreneurs and enable them to make better use of\nopportunities provided by the Project.\n117. Because ADB funds are for a long term, the PFIs will also be strengthened financially by\nreducing their duration- and interest-variation risks and improving fund management. By using the\nnetwork of financial institutions and NGOs, the Project will be able to provide access to financial\nservices to existing and potential small enterprises and microenterprises. In the process, the\ncapacity of NGO-PFIs to carry out sustainable and cost-effective lending to microenterprises will\nbe enhanced and permanent access provided to the poor in rural areas.", "31\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Economic and Financial Analyses\n118. Economic  and  financial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  two  components:  (i)  the\nimprovement of road maintenance, and (ii) the upgrading of market infrastructure. In addition,\nanalysis has been made of indicative agriculture-based enterprises representing the types of\ninvestments that entrepreneurs may undertake with credit and advisory services provided by the\nProject.  Plans are to improve 1,049 km (roughly 29 km per pradeshiya sabha) of economically\nimportant gravel roads into a condition in which they are maintainable by local government\nauthorities. A total of 20 markets will also be upgraded, both to improve the level of services to\ntraders and consumers and to enhance the revenue that pradeshiya sabhas glean from such\nmarkets. The indicative enterprises include floriculture for export, fruit, a poultry hatchery, broiler\nproduction, ornamental fish, fish culture, a rice mill, and a shoe manufacture.  During the six\nyears of project implementation, approximately 8,000\u201310,000 of such enterprises are expected to\nemerge, encouraged by project assistance including financing, marketing services, TA, and other\nbusiness management services.  Detailed results of the economic and financial analyses are\nsummarized in Appendix 15.\n1.  Economic Justification\n119. The economic analysis adopted a world price numeraire and used values expressed in\nconstant 2001 prices.  Economic costs were derived from financial cost data, and nontraded\ngoods and services were converted to economic values using a standard conversion factor of 0.9\nand a shadow wage rate of 0.75.  Enhanced benefits of induced demand that might be expected\nfrom the completion of the ADB-financed Southern Transport Corridor Project and the Southern\nRoad Improvement Project have been excluded from project benefits.\n120. Quantifiable benefits of gravel rural roads include the value of time savings to travelers,\ndecreased vehicle operating costs, and a decrease in the amount of spoilage of agricultural\nproduce transported on the roads.  The economic internal rate of return of the roads is 23 percent\nand the economic net present value is SLRs470 million.  Sensitivity analyses for decreases in\nbenefits and increase in costs indicates that these results are quite robust.  Care must, of course,\nbe paid to the level of maintenance actually done, as inadequate maintenance could eventually\ndecrease road services to their without-project level. The Project will provide substantial TA to\nensure that road improvements result in maintainable roads and to help local authorities develop\nfinancial systems that will enable them to fulfill all of their maintenance responsibilities.\n121. Rural markets comprise the most important marketing channel for farm produce in the\nproject area.  Facilities, however, are inadequate.  Benefits of market upgrading will include a\nreduction in the amount of spoilage of agricultural produce that is traded, plus a portion of the\nincreased business that could be expected from better facilities. The economic internal rate of\nreturn for this component is 26 percent and the economic net present value is SLRs142 million.\nThese figures are also quite robust.\n122. The  Project  will  provide  enterprise  development  services  and  access  to  credit  to\nentrepreneurs  in  the  project  area.    While  the  actual  agriculture-based  investments  by  such\nentrepreneurs  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  a  number  of  indicative\nenterprises have been examined.  Rates of return for these enterprises indicate that all are\neconomically viable, indicating their potential for economic benefits to the local economy.", "32\n2.  Financial Justification\n123. Pradeshiya  sabhas  have  responsibility  for  a  number  of  services,  including  the\nmaintenance of rural roads. These local government entities, however, do have limited revenue\nsources.  Rent from markets represent one of the sources of revenue over which local authorities\nhave  control.    One  of  the  goals  of  the  market  improvement  component  is  to  increase  the\npradeshiya sabhas\u2019 income from this source. The enhanced facilities of such markets will be likely\nto generate greater produce sales and provide increased rents and fees than would unimproved\nmarkets. For a large market that was examined, incremental income (net of O&M costs) is\nestimated at SLRs1.3 million annually. For a smaller market, this revenue increment is estimated\nat SLRs300,000.  In addition, the Project will also provide public finance management training\nand services to the pradeshiya sabhas to help them develop additional ways in which to raise\nrevenues and manage their budgets.\n124. Financial analysis were also undertaken for 10 indicative enterprises.  These analyses\nassumed an enterprise life of 15 years in most instances, according to the nature of investment.\nNo salvage values were assumed to exist at the end of this enterprise life. Financial internal rates\nof return for the sample enterprises ranged between 30 percent for leather shoe production to 66\npercent for pineapples. These results demonstrate the profitability of such potential enterprises\nand their attractiveness to local entrepreneurs given that the returns are well above 18\u201320\npercent average cost of capital in Sri Lanka.\nTable 3:  Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis\n                                     Road and Market Components Indicative Enterprises\nMaintenance Market Leather Shoe Pineapple Processing\nImprovement Infrastructure Production\nfor Road Improvement\nItem EIRR Switching EIRR Switching EIRR Switching EIRR Switching\n(%) (%) (%) (%)\nBase 23 26 80 53\nCase\n10% 21 70 24 75 68 94 45 110\nCost\nOverrun\n10% 20 40 23 45 67 48 45 52\nDecline in\nBenefits\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return\nSource: Mission estimates.\nB. Environment\n125. No significant negative environmental impact is expected from the Project. Some minor\nand  scattered  environmental  disturbance  may  potentially  occur  as  a  result  of  some  of  the\nsubprojects taken up for financing by the credit line in Part I (para.113). These will be avoided,\nminimized,  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  the  guidelines  to  be  developed  by  project-financed\nconsultants, and which are consistent with environmental guidelines of ADB and the Government.", "33\n126.  With regard to Part II, the works involved for the rural roads will be simple maintenance\nworks and no serious environmental impacts are likely. In the case of market upgrading, some\nnoise, dust, and disturbance may be experienced for a temporary period while upgrading works\nare under way, but once completed, the market site itself will be improved, with better drainage\nand traffic movement.\nC. Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n127. The Project will address the key poverty issue of lack of employment opportunities for\nvulnerable groups, most of who are currently engaged in agriculture and related activities. The\nProject  will  also  generate  new  economic  opportunities  for  marginalized  groups,  such  as\ncommunities engaged in fishing, coconut workers, urban slum dwellers, etc. Part I of the Project will\nsupport micro and small enterprises, and enable expansion of term credit facilities to those who\ncurrently  have  limited  access  to  it. As  microenterprises  are  dominated  by  the  economically\nweaker sections of society, especially women, it will improve women\u2019s livelihood and directly and\nindirectly  benefit  the  poor.40  In  addition,  the  EDS  will  help  upgrade  technology  and  market\nlinkages,  and  generate  employment  for  about  25,000  persons.41  The  enterprise  development\nassistance and awareness building efforts of the Project for youth will contribute to making the\nnecessary transitional process easier for both youth and local business communities to utilize the\nemerging opportunities. Because ADB funds are for a long term, the PFIs will also be strengthened\nfinancially by reducing their duration- and interest-variation risks and improving fund management.\nIn the process, the capacity of NGO-PFIs to carry out sustainable and cost-effective lending to\nmicroenterprises will be enhanced and permanent access provided to the poor in rural areas.\n128. The social impact of Part II will be positive as it will facilitate an interface between\nproducers and markets. By keeping rural roads in an operable condition the component will help\nprovide the infrastructure needed for the rural population to access health and sanitation benefits,\neducation, as well as product marketing facilities. Moreover, improved markets will allow the local\npopulation access to an increased range of productive activities as well as to better quality\nproduce at lower prices.\n129. Not  undertaking  the  component,  on  the  other  hand,  could  lead  to  serious  social\ndeprivation as the existing access to services and economic opportunities will be lost.  A further\npositive  social  aspect  of  the  component  is  that  it  will  generate  employment  through  road\nmaintenance activities and lead to a higher level of skills among the rural population.  An offshoot\nof the component may be better cooperation among rural residents as they form beneficiary\ngroups to help share the burden of the pradeshiya sabhas for road maintenance.  Some voluntary\nrural road maintenance activities have already taken place within Southern Province and this\ncomponent will help them to continue more effectively and efficiently.\nD. Risks\n130. To minimize the risks involved in implementation, the project design has been built firmly\non the ongoing reforms and the new rural economic advancement policy of the Government. This\ninvolves a focus on farm- and nonfarm-related enterprise development, increased partnership\n                  \n40  Microenterprises, which generally use family labor alone, are poor and include small-scale traders, cottage\nindustry operators, weavers, and small service providers. The stratified sample survey undertaken by the TA\nindicated that females owned only 8 percent of surveyed enterprises and most were microenterprises.\n41  This was calculated based on data of Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (5,800 SME borrowers with\nan average borrowing of $24,000 created 42,800 new jobs) and results of the stratified sample survey undertaken.\nFor microenterprises, two additional full-time jobs are assumed and for small enterprises, six jobs are assumed,\nwhich adds up to: 14,000 + 9,000 = 23,000.", "34\nwith  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  for  this  process,  and  decentralized  implementation.\nNevertheless, some risks could affect overall project success.\n131. First, the REAP approach envisages a private sector-led and decentralized mode of\noperation under which a new structure of roles and responsibilities has to necessarily evolve for\nMPI and SPC. This would imply new capacity to discharge new responsibilities and attitudinal\nshifts from what has thus far characterized the two agencies. The Project provides adequate\nsupport  to  enable  the  participating  public  sector  agencies  to  make  this  transition,  but  any\nobstructions encountered in this process can affect the project success. Therefore, a start-up\nperiod of one year is built into project implementation and close monitoring of project is planned\nduring the first year.\n132.  Second, the Project will entail an innovative partnership between SPC, and private- and\nNGO-operated EDS. Initiating and operating this partnership will have risks. As a first step, the\ndialogue process with MPI, SPC, and potential private sector partners was initiated during project\nprocessing and joint workshops organized. To minimize risks and ensure clear delineation of\noperational modalities, the lead EDS agency is housed in the PMO and will function as the\ntechnical support unit of the public sector.\n133. Third, local entrepreneurs are unable to identify adequate profitable opportunities for\ninvestment  in  the  region.  The  project  design  therefore  includes  initial  investment  surveys,\nidentification of investment opportunities, and canvassing of potential entrepreneurs during the\nfirst year. The investigation of possible private sector partners in the Project has focused on\nagencies that have developed sufficient links with industry and market to make the necessary\nlinkages with the new enterprises.\n134.  Fourth, the Project is designed against the backdrop of several new developments that\nwill enhance the potential for economic growth in Southern Province. These include projects\nfinanced by ADB, such as the Southern Transport Development Project, and other development\npartners. If completion of any of these projects or accrual of benefits is delayed, the overall\npotential benefit generated by the proposed Project will be reduced. But, this eventuality has\nbeen considered and due care taken in testing the economic viability of the Project (only benefits\ndirectly generated by project activities have been calculated and those emanating from other\nprojects have been ignored). The projected growth in vehicular traffic, for example, does not take\ninto account increased traffic generated by the completion of the Southern Provincial Roads\nImprovement Project and the Southern Transport Development Project. With the successful\ncompletion of these other projects, the overall impact of the Project can be expected to be\nsubstantially greater than shown by the economic analysis.\n135. Finally, risk is associated with lack of O&M of rural infrastructure, particularly roads.\nBenefits from this component are dependent upon the upgrading being done properly, especially\nfor adequate compaction and drainage; and upon local governments implementing adequate\nO&M regime on these roads. To decrease this risk, the Project (i) has set up road selection\ncriteria,  (ii)  requires  that  local  governments  sign  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the\nprovincial council to implement adequate maintenance on chosen roads, and (iii) provides TA to\nensure quality road improvement and maintenance regimes, and guide pradeshiya sabhas in\nrevenue generation and budgetary management.", "35\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n136.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  In each year during the term of the Project, full financing will be available in SPC\u2019s\nannual budget for the continued operation of all project activities, equipment, and\nvehicles and to NDB in accordance with the Subsidiary Loan Agreement.\n(ii)  The credit line established under Part I of the Project will not be subject to debt\namnesty or any other forgiveness of loan payment obligations.\n(iii)  A participation agreement, satisfactory to ADB, will be signed between NDB and\neach PFI setting out the terms and conditions for relending from NDB to each PFI\nand from each PFI to end borrowers, including detailed operating instructions for\nthe PFIs, within one month of loan effectiveness and prior to any relending of loan\nproceeds by the Government to ADB.\n(iv)  The project implementation unit at NDB will be established and staffed to the\nsatisfaction  of  ADB  within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness  and  prior  to  any\nrelending of loan proceeds by the Government to NDB.\n(v)  NDB and each PFI will implement the PFI operating instructions during the term of\nthe Project.\n(vi)  The three district coordinating offices in each of Galle, Hambantota, and Matara\nunder the PMO will be established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB within\none month of loan effectiveness.\n(vii)  The  following  committees  will  be  established  within  one  month  of  loan\neffectiveness: (a) a project management committee under the chief secretary of\nSouthern  Province,  (b)  a  provincial  steering  committee,  and  (c)  a  national\ncoordination committee.\n(viii)  Agreements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  signed  between  PMO  and  each\nparticipating  EDS  provider,  setting  out  the  terms  of  cooperation  for  project\nimplementation, the target number and types of enterprises that each agency will\nestablish under the Project, and the criteria by which performance will be judged,\nwithin six months of loan effectiveness.\n(ix)  The lead EDS technical support provider will (i) ensure that each EDS provider will\ndevelop an annual work plan satisfactory to ADB, and (ii) consolidate all such work\nplans in each case prior to the commencement of each year during the Project.\n(x)  Within  three  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  SPC  will  enter  into  agreements\nsatisfactory  to  ADB  with  each  participating  pradeshiya  sabha  detailing  the\ncommitments to be made by each pradeshiya sabha for participation in either the\nroad upgrading and maintenance component or the market upgrading component,\nincluding participation in capacity-building advisory services under Part II of the", "36\nProject, and for continued maintenance of roads and markets that are upgraded\nunder the Project.\n(xi)  Within one year of loan effectiveness, NDB will establish a revolving fund to credit\ninterest payments and principle repayments by the project PFIs, and NDB will\nmaintain  the  revolving  fund  for  at  least  15  years,  in  each  case  in  a  manner\nsatisfactory to ADB.\n(xii)  Environmental  and  social  considerations  will  be  implemented,  including  the\napplicable laws and regulations of Sri Lanka, and ADB's environmental guidelines\nand guidelines on gender and development.\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n137. Conditions for loan effectiveness include the following:\n(i)  the PMO along with the heads of five PMO units will have been established and\nstaffed to the satisfaction of ADB;\n(ii)  a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and NDB, satisfactory to\nADB, will have been signed and all conditions to its effectiveness satisfied;\n(iii)  the  agreement  between  the  Government  and  the  lead  EDS  technical  support\nprovider under the Project, satisfactory to ADB, will have been signed; and\n(iv)  the OPEC Fund loan agreement, satisfactory to ADB, will have been executed and\ndelivered, and all conditions to its effectiveness, other than a condition requiring\nthe  effectiveness  of  the  ADB  loan  agreement,  will  have  been  fulfilled  or\narrangements satisfactory to ADB will have been made for the fulfillment thereof\nwithin a time period satisfactory to ADB.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n138. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\nand recommend that the Board approve (i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special\nDrawing Rights 19,384,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern\nProvince Rural Economic Advancement Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board;\nand (ii) the administration by ADB of the loan in an amount not exceeding $5,000,000 equivalent\nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Southern Province Rural Economic\nAdvancement Project to be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n3 October 2001", "37\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber       Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 38 1,2\n2 Overview of Sri Lanka's Financial Sector 41       5,15\n3 External Assistance to the Sector         44 7,21\n4 Selection and Design Criteria for Rural Roads         45      14,50\n5 Draft Memorandum of Understanding for Participation in         47      14,51\nthe Road Upgrading and Maintenance Component\n6 Selection Criteria for Market Upgrading         49      14,54\n7 Detailed Cost Estimates         50      16,59\n8 Project Organization Chart         51      19,69\n9 Indicative Terms of Reference for Lead Technical Support         52      20,76\nProvider for Enterprise Development Services\n10 Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions         54      21,79\n11 Draft Memorandum of Understanding for Participation in the         55      23,87\nMarket Upgrading Component\n12 Project Implementation Schedule         56 23,88\n13 Indicative Procurement Packages         58      24,92\n14 Indicative Terms of Reference for Consulting Services         59      25,93\n15 Economic and Financial Analyses         66      31,118\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Economic and Financial Analyses\nB Detailed Project Costs\nC Social Analysis\nD Summary Initial Environmental Examination\nE Operating Instructions for Financial Institutions\nF Provincial and Local Government of Sri Lanka", "38\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Verifiable Means of Assumptions/Risks\nIndicators Verification\nSector/ Area Goal\nAccelerate Enhanced per Economic Stability in the\neconomic growth capita regional monitoring macroeconomic and\nand employment gross domestic Unemployment political environment\nopportunities in product and statistics\nSouthern Province decreased\nunemployment rate\nPurpose\nEstablishment of Increased number Enterprise Financial institutions\nmicro-, small-, and of enterprises licensing, progress and enterprise\nmedium-sized reports, review service providers\nenterprises missions continue to reach\ntarget groups with\nassistance\nProvision and Local government Progress reports Proper identification\nmaintenance of key infrastructure and review of infrastructure to be\neconomic upgraded and mission upgraded and\ninfrastructure improved observations increased ability of\nlocal governments to\nmobilize funding for\nsustained\nmaintenance\nEnhancement of Private sector Review mission Stable policy\npublic sector participating in observations, framework for\ncapacity to facilitate project activities project completion decentralization and\nand sustain private reports;

Sri Lanka has a diversified banking system with commercial banks, licensed specialized\nbanks including development banks, and nonbank finance companies. There are 9 domestic\ncommercial banks, 1 savings bank, 5 development banks, 6 regional development banks, 10\nmerchant banks, 25 finance companies, 7 venture capital companies, 1,418 cooperative rural\nbanks, 14 district cooperative rural bank unions, and 8,424 primary thrift and credit cooperative\nsocieties.  The  Employees\u2019  Provident  Fund,  the  Employees\u2019  Trust  Fund,  and  about  204\napproved  private  provident  funds,  4  investment  management  companies,  8  insurance\ncompanies, 15 stock brokerage companies, and 7 venture capital companies complete the\nlandscape for the financial sector. As of the end of 1999, commercial banks\u2019 assets totaled\nSLRs571 billion, while National Savings Bank, Employees\u2019 Provident Fund, Employees\u2019 Trust\nFund, and insurance companies\u2019 assets totaled SLRs100 billion, SLRs210 billion, and SLRs27\nbillion, respectively. The market capitalization of the stock market was SLRs113 billion.\n2. The commercial and licensed specialized banks have 1,324 branches in the country.\nApart from foreign banks, all other types of institutions are represented in Southern Province\nwith 110 commercial and development banks branches, 34 cooperative rural banks, 1,255 thrift\nand  credit  cooperative  societies,  and  more  than  900  village  banks  served  by  a  range  of\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Many  potential  rural  clients  are  not  able  to  access\nappropriate financial services, particularly term credit. Although access appears to be somewhat\ngood  for  small  borrowers  from  very  poor  households  who  borrow  less  than  SLRs20,000\nbecause of NGO/cooperative and Government intervention programs focused on this segment,\nthe amount borrowed is insufficient to impact their living standards.\n3. Various measures were implemented during the 1990s to reform the financial markets.\nThese included the adoption of international accounting standards in the banking system and\ncapital markets; recapitalization of state banks; and improvement of regulation, supervision, and\ninfrastructure of the stock market. The ongoing financial sector reform program has created the\nconditions for the gradual emergence of a more market-oriented financial system. Interest rates,\nwith  the  exception  of  Government-sponsored  programs,  are  market  determined;  and\npolicymakers  appear  to  be  more  receptive  to  the  introduction  of  a  market-driven  financial\nsystem. Brief profiles of selected institutions and arrangements relevant to the Project follow.\nA. State-Owned Commercial Banks\n4. Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and People\u2019s Bank (PB) broadly constitute half of the commercial\nbanking system. BOC with 37 branches and PB with 38 branches are active in Southern\nProvince.  Whereas  BOC  continues  to  show  improvement  in  its  financial  structure  and\nperformance, PB has yet to demonstrate acceptable performance standards. BOC is in the\nprocess of restructuring and reorganizing to develop sustainable capacity in domestic and\nglobal banking. BOC assets in 1999 totaled SLRs179 billion and BOC posted a profit of SLRs2\nbillion.1 Loan repayments are stated to be 86 percent. Total nonperforming loans (NPL) are\nabout 17 percent. The annual return on total assets averaged 1.55 percent over the last three\nyears while return on shareholders funds averaged 23 percent.\n                  \n1   Provisional data in this appendix will be replaced with audited figures as soon as they are available.", "42 Appendix 2, page 2\nB. Private Commercial Banks\n5. The private commercial banks with branches in Southern Province are Hatton National\nBank (8 branches), Sampath Bank (4 branches), Seylan Bank (9 branches), and Commercial\nBank  of  Ceylon  Limited  (3  branches).  These  banks  are  conscious  of  the  need  to  satisfy\nshareholders as well as customers, so are oriented toward the provision of high-quality services,\nand the expansion of attractive services. While some commercial banks cross-hold shares,\ncompetition in the financial services market is substantial.\n6. Hatton National Bank is the largest private sector bank with an asset base of SLRs88\nbillion in 2000. Profit after tax in 2000 was SLRs800 million. Return on total assets for the year\nwas 2.1 percent and 10.7 percent on equity. Seylan Bank with an asset base of SLRs56 billion\nin 2000 is the second largest private sector bank. Return on total assets, however, was lower at\n0.48 percent and return on equity stood at 13 percent. It made a profit of SLRs246 million during\n2000. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited has an asset base of SLRs42 billion and made a\nprofit of SLRs658 million in 2000 with a return on asset at 1.7 percent and a 16.2 percent return\non equity. Total assets of Sampath Bank stood at SLRs27 billion and its corresponding return\non assets and equity were 1.2 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. All four banks have\ncollection ratios above 80 percent based on 2000 data.\nC. Licensed Specialized Banks\n7. Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC)  and National Development Bank\nof  Sri  Lanka  (NDB)  have  played  a  major  role  in  providing  long-term  finance  to  private\nenterprises, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises. DFCC reported total assets of\nSLRs24 billion, while NDB had total assets of SLRs38 billion in 2000. Both banks are profitable,\nwith a return on assets in the range of 1.4\u20132.10 percent, and return on equity above 10 percent\nduring 2000. They have diversified into other activities including fund management, venture\ncapital, securities, and investment banking activities. They finance their operations by issuing\nbonds and borrowing from other domestic and international financial institutions. About 32\npercent  of  DFCC  direct  loans  and  43  percent  of  NDB  direct  loans  were  financed  by\nmultilateral/bilateral financial institutions. Loan collection levels are above 80 percent.\n8. Ruhuna  Development  Bank  (RDB)  was  created  by  merging  three  regional  rural\ndevelopment banks in Galle, Hambantota, and Matara. RDB\u2019s head office is in Matara and 33\nbranches in: Galle (12), Hambantota (8), and Matara (13). RDB has 416 staff. Central Bank of\nSri Lanka (CBSL) is the major shareholder with a 68 percent stake. As a specialized licensed\nbank, RDB cannot provide demand deposit and checking accounts. As of 31 August 2000,\nloans outstanding amounted to SLRs1,345 million and deposits were SLRs954 million. At start-\nup, RDB inherited a substantial amount of classified loans resulting mostly from Government-\nand project-sponsored credit programs. RDB management with support of CBSL is actively\nengaged in reducing the nonperforming loans.\n9. SANASA Development Bank (SDB) was established in 1997 with an issued capital of\nSLRs121 million. SDB\u2019s role is \u201cto mobilize deposits at competitive rates of interest and invest\nsuch deposits in community-based lending programs with particular focus on Sanasa societies,\ntheir members, and microenterprises.\u201d While SDB mainly lends to district unions and directly to\nprimary  societies  (acting  as  an  apex  institution),  it  also  lends  to  NGOs,  community-based\norganizations, self-help groups, and individuals who are not society members. Total assets at\nthe end of 1999 stood at SLRs1,047 million. SDB posted a loss of SLRs485 million in 1999. The\nnegative  bottom  line  is  largely  a  result  of  high  operational  expenditure  and  provisioning", "43 Appendix 2, page 3\nrequirements. Net interest remained positive in the last two years of operations. SDB\u2019s financial\nresults  and  performance  are  expected  to  sufficiently  improve  to  provide  eligibility  as  a\nparticipating financial institution. However, eligible Sanasa societies could participate in the\nproject to provide financial services to microenterprises.\nD. Nonbank Financial Institutions\n10. At the end of 1999, 14 district cooperative rural bank unions (DCRBUs), including 3 in\nSouthern  Province,  serviced  242  multipurpose  credit  societies  under  apex  arrangements\nwhereby the DCRBUs are owned by the cooperative societies and are supervised by the\nDepartment of Cooperatives. DCRBUs will have to strengthen their equity base, and improve\ntheir management and governance to qualify as participating financial institutions. Within the\nmultipurpose credit societies in Southern Province at end of 1999, 34 cooperative rural banks\nhad 486,000 members.\n11. The size of venture capital companies in Sri Lanka is still small, with combined assets of\nonly SLRs2.9 billion. Seven venture capital companies invested in 232 projects in 1999, with\nabout two thirds of the funds for start-up operations. Equity and venture capital services find it\ndifficult to cash out (exit) investments and their financial performance is inadequate to offset\nfailures against investment success of the enterprises. Ruhuna Venture Capital Company in\nSouthern Province has discontinued its equity financing services.\nE. Nongovernment Organizations\n12. The  Janashakhti  program  run  by  the  Women's  Development  Federation  uses  a\nmultidimensional approach to poverty reduction aimed at women. There are 67 Janashakthi\nbank societies with 27,903 members in more than 5,300 groups of five women. The aggregate\nloan  outstanding  and  deposits  at  March  2000  was  SLRs61  million  and  SLRs44  million,\nrespectively. Nearly one third of the loans are for microenterprises with a 24 percent interest\nrate. Loan repayment rate is 95 percent.\n13. Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services Ltd. (SEEDS), operates in 18\ndistricts and services 2,398 autonomous village societies that have 193,250 group members.\nSEEDS provides systems and training to the societies and has a program that raises societies\nto the status of village banks of which there are now 365. Services, targeting the poor, comprise\nbusiness training, consulting, and agricultural extension. As at March 2000, loans outstanding\nwere  SLRs493  million  to  190,000  borrowers  and  SLRs469  million  in  savings  in  574,300\naccounts. The lending rate is around 24 percent. SEEDS can lend up to SLRs500,000 for\nmicroenterprises. The loan recovery rate is 94 percent. Women comprise 60 percent of total\nborrowers.\nF. Colombo Stock Exchange\n14. Despite the capitalization of the Colombo Stock Exchange growing about three times\nfrom 1990 to 1999 to about SLRs113 billion and the number of listed companies increasing to\n237, the market is quite shallow, accounting for only 10 percent of gross domestic product in\n1999.  Turnover  was  SLRs14.8  billion  in  1999,  accounting  for  only  13  percent  of  market\ncapitalization. The corporate debt market is constrained because of the high interest rate being\noffered on Government debt, few investors, and insignificant volume of trading in the secondary\nmarket. Where trading occurs it is at heavily discounted prices. Other than this, the regulatory\nframework, institutional structures and fiscal incentives are in place.", "44\nAppendix 3\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR\nAmount\nFunding Body                               Project Title (million)\n    Grant              Loan Datea\nADB North Central Province Rural Development Project          $20.0 1996\nADB Southern Province Rural Development Project          $36.0 1991\nWorld Bank Third Rural Development Project     SDR21.4 1984\nWorld Bank Second Rural Development Project           $80.0 1981\nWorld Bank Kurunegala District Integrated Rural Development Project           $55.0 1979\nIFAD Matale Regional Economic Advancement Project           $11.7 2000\nIFAD North Central Province Participatory Rural Development Project           $8.53 1995\nIFAD Northwestern Province Dry Zone Participatory Development  Project           $8.85 1993\nIFAD Second Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project        SDR9.9 1991\nIFAD Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development Project        SDR7.5 1986\nIFAD Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project    SDR12.95 1982\nUNDP Area Based Growth With Equity Programme        $4.9 1997\nUNDP Second Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project        $1.4 1991\nUNICEF Puttalam District Integrated Rural Development Project        $2.29 1992\nWFP Participatory Rural Development Project (North Central Province)        $1.92 1995\nEEC Moneregala District Integrated Rural Development Project  ECU5.76 1994\nFinland Kalutara District Integrated Rural Development Project  Fmk33.0 1987\nGermany Enterprise Information Project      DM3.0 1998\nGermany Integrated Food Security Project    DM10.0 1998\nGermany Rural Banking Innovations Project      DM4.5 1996\nGermany Competency Economies through Formation of Entrepreneurs      DM3.0 1995\nGermany Kurunegala Northwestern Province Dry Zone Development Project         $3.3 1993\nGermany Kandy District Integrated Rural Development Project DM13.96 1987\nJapan Agriculture Extension and Improvement Project     Y1,533 1994\nJapan Gampaha District Integrated Rural Development Project     Y1,726 1988\nNetherlands Ratnapura District Integrated Rural Development Project       F26.5 1984\nNetherlands Nuwara Eliya District Integrated Rural Development Project       F35.0 1980\nNorway Development and Rehabilitation for Batticola District   NKr60.0 1997\nNorway Human Resources and Institutional Development Project   NKr10.0 1995\nNorway Monaragala District Integrated Rural Development Project NKr170.0 1984\nNorway Hambantota District Integrated Rural Development Project   NKr200.0 1979\nSweden North Central Province Participatory Rural Development         $3.3 1995\nSweden Human Resources and Institutional Development Project     SKr3.0 1992\nSweden Matara District Integrated Rural Development Project SKr156.6 1979\nSweden Badulla District Integrated Rural Development Project         $1.4 1982\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EEC = European Economic Council, IFAD = International Fund for Agricultural Development,\nUNDP = United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF = United Nations Children Emergency Fund, WFP = World Food\nProgramme\naDate of Agreement\nSource:  Ministry of Plan Implementation.", "45\nAppendix 4, page 1\nSELECTION AND DESIGN CRITERIA FOR RURAL ROAD MAINTENANCE\nA. Selection Criteria\n1. Each pradeshiya sabha will be given the option to select 30 kilometers (km) of rural road\nfor intensive maintenance works. The first step of such works will entail preventive maintenance\nto bring the roads into a condition in which they can be maintained with minimum cost over\nsubsequent years. The cost of preventive maintenance works is costed at about SLRs750,000\nper km. Subsequent maintenance activities will cost about SLRs75,000 per km per annum.\nSelection criteria for roads to be included in this scheme will include the following:\n(i) Roads will connect with major provincial (class C and D) or national (class A and\nB) roads.\n(ii)   Roads  will  be  gravel  surfaced  since  the  preventive  maintenance  cost  and\nrecurrent maintenance cost of tarred roads would be prohibitively expensive.\n(iii) Roads taken up for maintenance will serve an identified economic purpose such\nas access to a particular market, access to an agriculturally productive area (e.g.,\ntea gardens or a fishing beach), or access to processing facilities.\n(iv) Roads will be given priority if they provide the only means of vehicle access to\nisolated areas with poor levels of income.\n(v) Roads should be in a reasonable operable condition to start with (i.e., they\nshould not require major and costly rehabilitation works). To this effect, estimated\npreventive  maintenance  costs  should  not  exceed  SLRs100,000  per  km  on\naverage for a particular pradeshiya sabha.\n(vi)   All river and channel crossings on proposed roads should have operable bridges.\nB.   Design Criteria\n2. With proper maintenance, an unpaved road can provide a good level of service for\ntraffic.  The purpose of maintenance is to provide smooth passage for vehicles by repairing\ndamage caused by a combination of weather and traffic.  The first objective of maintenance is to\nkeep the road in such a condition that it sheds water quickly.  If a road does not shed water, the\nsurface becomes soft and ruts, potholes will quickly appear.  Under such conditions earth roads\nsoon become impassable.\n3. Maintenance to restore a good camber to the road to enable rapid drainage is best\nachieved by regular grading or patching to fill potholes, maintain the shape of the surface, repair\nerosion gullies, and restore displaced gravel from the shoulders to the main road platform.\nPatching is the optimum method for general repairs when machinery is not readily available and\nrequires properly trained workers.\n4. To  minimize  maintenance  activities  and  hence  maintenance  cost  a  well-designed\nunpaved road is necessary in the first place. This entails a road with adequately compacted\nfoundation, subbase, and surface layers; a properly shaped surface; properly sorted surface\nmaterial; and adequate lateral drainage.", "46\nAppendix 4, page 2\n5. The Department of Local Government has prepared a standard design to which unpaved\nroads taken up by the Project will be upgraded to ensure optimum maintenance. It involves a 6-\nmeter wide road with a 4-meter platform with a 4 percent crossfall and  a 1:1.5 sideslope. Side\ndrains are designed at 0.6 meters on either side.  The surface dressing will be 300 millimeters of\ngravel. Of an average of four to six culverts per km, approximately two will need replacement as\npart of the upgrading.  Two designs are envisaged, a box culvert and a pipe culvert, depending\non the estimated size of the cross flow to be accommodated.

Introduction\n1. The Southern Province Regional Economic Advancement Project (SPREAP) will have a\ndirect impact on the provincial economy by: (i) correcting market failure where information and\nnew technology that is required to establish new business enterprises presently reaches only a\nlimited number of entrepreneurs, and where inadequate marketing facilities and infrastructure\nimpede the improvement of marketing of agricultural produce;  (ii) contributing to an equitable\nadjustment for the existing skewed distribution of economic opportunities in the project area by\naddressing particularly the needs of identified socially vulnerable groups such as women and\nunemployed youth;  (iii) complementing the economic advancement impact of other Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB)-funded projects such as Southern Provincial Roads Improvement and\nSouthern  Transport  Development;  and  (iv)  generating  nonquantifiable  benefits  such  as\nimprovement  of  sanitation  standards  by  improving  market  facilities  and  expansion  of\nemployment  by  helping  entrepreneurs  establish  new  enterprises  and  upgrade  existing\nbusinesses.\nB. Demand Analysis\n1. Demand for Improving Markets and Access Roads\n2. Rural markets (active one or two days a week) comprise the most important marketing\nchannel for farm produce in the project area. Most agricultural produce for local consumption is\ntraded at such markets and wholesale traders catering to urban markets also procure much of\ntheir fruits and vegetables from farmers and other traders at local markets.  The demand for\nbetter quality vegetables and fruit is strong, both for local consumption and for urban markets.1\nCurrent markets, however, are not really suitable for high-quality produce trade due to their low\nsanitation  standard  and  uncovered  and  earthen-floored  facilities.  Traded  produce  is  also\ndamaged during transit due to the poor quality of local rural access roads.  Quantitative and\nqualitative produce losses incurred in the local marketing chain are estimated at approximately\n40 percent of farmgate production.2  A series of discussions was undertaken with producers and\ntraders in the markets and better facilities and management were identified as among their top\npriorities.3  Improvement  of  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  markets  and  local  access  roads,\ntherefore,  can  be  seen  as  directly  benefiting  consumers,  farmers,  and  traders.  Such\nimprovements will also complement the development impacts of the ADB-financed Southern\nTransport  Corridor  Project  and  the  Southern  Road  Improvement  Project,  although  benefit\nquantification has conservatively excluded the potential demand induced by these two road\ninvestments.\n2. Demand for Credit\n3. The demand for credit by potential Southern Province entrepreneurs is estimated from\nthe past experience of financial institutions participating in small- and medium-sized enterprise\n                  \n1  TA  3385-SRI: Southern Province Rural Economic  Advancement Project.

Post-Harvest Processing and Marketing\nReport No. 3, p. 34.", "67\nAppendix 15, page 2\n(SME) development initiatives.4  From 1997 to 2002, the countrywide aggregate credit demand\nfor SME credit for 13 prospective participating financial institutions was about $262.5 million, out\nof which $68 million is for 2001.  About 10 to 15 percent of this estimated demand is expected to\nemanate  from  the  project  area.  Assuming  a  continuation  of  the  historical  growth  in  credit\ndemand of 15 to 20 percent per year, the credit demand among SME enterprises in the project\narea during implementation amounts to at least $60 million.\nC. Economic Analysis\n1. General\n4. Prices and other information used in the analysis were identified through market surveys\nand observations. To determine the expected direct benefits of the project components in\nquestion, quantifiable effects are valued by comparison of \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios.\nBasic assumptions include\n(i)  the use of a world price numeraire;\n(ii)  values expressed in constant 2001 prices so as to exclude inflation;\n(iii)  the Sri Lankan rupee is the unit of account, and the rate of exchange used here\nis the prevailing rate at the time of appraisal: SLRs 90 per dollar;\n(iv)  for nontraded goods and services, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 and\na shadow wage rate (SWR) of 0.75 are used; and\n(v)  transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies are excluded in the calculation of\neconomic values.\n2. Benefits\na. Improvement of Rural Roads to Maintainable Standards\n5. Gravel rural roads under local authorities (pradeshiya sabhas) are to be selected by the\nProject  for  upgrading  into  easily  maintainable  condition.    Selection  criteria  emphasize  the\neconomic  importance  of  the  roads  to  be  improved,  particularly  their  association  with  rural\nmarkets. Benefits of these road enhancements are associated with the initial improvement in\nroad quality plus the retention of that improved condition through timely and appropriate levels\nof maintenance.  Through better compaction, the installation of drains, etc., the improved roads\n(compared with their original condition) are expected to be within the capacity of the pradeshiya\nsabhas to maintain in good condition throughout the project life of 15 years.   Benefits include (i)\ndecreased vehicle operating cost (VOC), estimated to decline from SLRs9.0/kilometer (km) to\n6.9/km as a per vehicle average; (ii) reduced travel time for farmers and consumers as average\nspeed on the roads increases from 10 km/hr to 15 km/hr; and (iii) a 15 percent decrease in the\namount of spoilage of agricultural produce during transportation to the markets.5  Spoilage and\ntraffic benefits are calculated in relation to the volume of business generated by the average of\ntwo markets (one large and one small) in the project area. To be conservative, benefits to future\ntraffic increases are not included in the analysis.\n                  \n4  The discussion of credit flows to SMEs is constrained by limitations of data. Neither the Central Bank of Sri\nLanka nor the commercial banks collect SME data systematically.  The information in this document has been\ncompiled from various sources and the analysis is primarily based on externally financed projects rather than an\noverview of the various banks\u2019 financing experience.  Figures are based on projections from Loan 1552: SRI:\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $55 million, approved on  5 June 1997.\n5  Figures are drawn from TA 3385-SRI: Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project, for $800,000,\napproved on 29 December 1999.", "68\nAppendix 15, page 3\nb.  Market Infrastructure Upgrading\n6. Rural markets usually include some open-sided stalls with roofs plus a larger area of\ncompletely  bare-earth,  open-air  stalls.  Access  and  parking  are  generally  congested  and\nsanitation is poor.  Improvements under the Project, while site-specific, are likely to include\nelements of sanitation, stall construction, paving, parking improvements, etc.  Benefits are\nexpected  to  include  (i)  a  9  percent  decrease  in  the  amount  of  produce  spoilage  during\nmarketing, resulting in increased farmer sales from what they bring to the market; and (ii) a 5\npercent increase in market business (beyond the increase due to decreased spoilage) due to\nbetter facilities for consumers and traders, half of which is assumed to be generated income\nincluded as an economic benefit. Actual markets to be upgraded will be determined during\nproject implementation and will depend upon various selection criteria.  For this analysis, two\nmarkets  have  been  evaluated:  one  at  Suriyawewa,  which  is  relatively  large,  plus  one  at\nAngunakalopalessa, which is relatively small (footnote 5). The value of agricultural produce\ntraded in the markets is calculated from the average local market price (by season) for produce\nof the typical quality that prevails in these markets. These prices often differ from those of\nexport-quality commodities elsewhere in the country.\nc.  Indicative Economic Activities Generated by the Project\n7. The Project will provide enterprise development services and access to credit both for:\n(i) the upgrading and commercialization of existing agriculture-based enterprises, and (ii) the\nestablishment of new enterprises. The calculated generated net economic value of indicative\nenterprises represents the expected benefit to the local economy. Identified indicative enterprise\nactivities include broiler production, fruit production and processing, ornamental fish, fish pond\nculture, rice milling, shoe production, a poultry hatchery, and floriculture.\n3. Costs\n8. Estimated costs of improvements for the two sample markets are used.  Rural road\nimprovement costs are likely to differ by terrain and by the distance that the material must be\ntransported.  An average estimated cost per km of SLRs725,000  (plus physical contingencies)\nis  used.    To  calculate  subcomponent  returns  for  the  roads  and  markets  subcomponents\n(respectively), shares of project implementation costs are included in the analysis.\n4.  Economic Returns\n9. The rural roads subcomponent is expected to implement the improvement of 1,049 km\nof gravel roads.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 23 percent and the economic net\npresent value is SLRs470 million (Table A15.1).  Sensitivity analyses for decreases in the\nvarious benefits (spoilage and VOC decreases and time saving) and an increase in costs\nindicate that these results are fairly robust. Maintenance, however, could prove to be a problem.\nIf  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  do  not  fulfill  their  responsibility  for  adequate  maintenance,  the\neconomic  returns  to  roads  could  dip  to  unacceptable  levels.  If  maintenance  is  sufficiently\ninadequate as to cause a decline in expected benefits of 10 percent each year over the\npreceding year, the EIRR will dip to minus 1 percent.\n10. The Project\u2019s market subcomponent assumes that 20 markets will be improved at an\naverage cost of SLRs9 million (plus physical contingencies). To analyze the full component, an\naverage of the Suriyawewa and Angunakalopalessa figures is used (Tables A15.2 and A15.3).\nUsing  the  assumption  that  benefits  can  be  expected  to  vary  in  proportion  to  the  level  of", "69\nAppendix 15, page 4\ninvestment,  all  benefits  are  adjusted  to  a  size  consistent  with  the  average  project  market\ninvestment. The EIRR for this subcomponent is 26 percent and the economic net present value\nis SLRs142 million.  Sensitivity analyses indicate the robustness of these figures.\n11. Rates of return for 10 indicative enterprises are summarized in Table A15.4.  All can be\nconsidered economically viable, indicating their potential for economic benefits to the local\neconomy.\nD. Financial Analysis\n1. Pradeshiya Sabha Market Revenue\n12. Pradeshiya  sabhas,  the  local  government  authorities,  have  responsibility  for  the\nprovision  of  a  number  of  local  services\u2014the  largest  of  which,  in  monetary  terms,  is  the\nmaintenance of rural roads.  Resources are generally inadequate for the budgetary demands.\nPradeshiya sabhas receive 60 to 70 percent of their revenue in the way of grants from provincial\nand  central  government  authorities.  They  also  raise  some  funds  on  their  own  via  various\nlicensing fees and rents. Of these sources, market revenues are particularly important.  One of\nthe goals of the improvement program for markets is to increase the pradeshiya sabhas\u2019 income\nfrom  this  source.  Market  managers  confirm  that  improved  markets,  compared  with  their\nunimproved state, will be likely to have more produce sales and will also be able to sustain an\nincrease in their fee rates due to the better facilities.  A \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d Project analysis of\npradeshiya sabha revenues is summarized in Table A15.3. The larger Suriyawewa market can\nbe expected to add SLRs1.3 million annually to the local authority\u2019s revenues while the smaller\nAngunakalopalessa  market  will  increase  revenues  by  SLRs300,000.  The  Project  will  also\nprovide public finance management training and services to the pradeshiya sabhas to help them\ndevelop additional ways in which to raise revenues and manage their budgets.\n13. Financial  analyses  have  been  undertaken  for  10  agricultural-based  indicative\nenterprises.  Typical  investment  costs  include  equipment,  implements  and  materials,  land\npreparation, planning, and labor.  Depending upon the enterprise, unskilled labor is particularly\nexpected to be utilized plus a limited amount of skilled labor. The financial internal rates of\nreturn are summarized in Table A15.4. These rates range between 30 percent for leather\nfootwear  production  to  66  percent  for  pineapple  production.  The  results  demonstrate  the\nprofitability of potential enterprises in the project area.", "Table A15.1:  Economic Cash Flow of the Rural Roads Componenta\n(SLRs '000 in Year 2001 Prices)\n                                                  Cost                                                                                             Incremental Benefitsb\nNet  cost Net cost Net cost Net cost Net cost Share of Total Total Total Total Total Net\nYr 1 Yr 2 Yr 3 Yr 4 Yr 5 Project Benefits Benefits Benefits Benefits Benefits Benefit\nconst. const. const. const. const.
