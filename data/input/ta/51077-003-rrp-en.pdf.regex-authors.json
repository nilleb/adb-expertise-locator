THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan; \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Maldives for the Greater Mal\u00e9 Waste-to-Energy \nProject.1 The report also describes (i) the proposed partial administration of a loan to be provided \nby the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the project; (ii) the proposed administration \nof a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JFJCM); and (iii) \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Capacity for Sustainable Waste-to-Energy \nService Delivery, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and administration of the loan and grant. \n \n2.  The project will establish a sustainable regional solid waste management (SWM) system \nfor the Greater Mal\u00e9 region and its neighboring outer islands by (i) developing treatment (proven \nwaste-to-energy [WTE] technology), recycling, and disposal infrastructure; (ii) strengthening \ninstitutional capacities for sustainable solid waste services delivery and environmental monitoring; \nand (iii) improving public awareness on WTE and reduce-reuse-recycle (3R). The project will be \ndesigned to reduce disaster risk and improve climate change resilience while creating a cleaner \nenvironment and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region 2  and  its  neighboring  outer  islands  suffer  from  severe \nenvironmental  pollution  and  deteriorating  livability  because  of  inadequate  collection  and \nhaphazard disposal of solid waste. The project area covers the Greater Mal\u00e9 region, and 32 \ninhabited outer islands and 86 tourist resorts within the Alifu Alifu Atoll, Alifu Dhaalu Atoll, Kaafu \nAtoll, and Vaavu Atoll, with a population of 295,000 (53% of Maldives\u2019 total population).3 The lack \nof a sustainable system to manage the 836 tons per day (tpd) of solid waste generated in the \nproject area (in 2019) results in waste spillage into the ocean, and open dumping and burning of \ngarbage at the 10-hectare (ha) dump site on Thilafushi island established in 1992, which has no \npollution control measures, creating a severe public health and environmental hazard.4 Plumes \nof smoke visible from Mal\u00e9, the international airport, and nearby resorts compromise air quality \nand pose a nuisance to residents and tourists, while leachate and plastics contaminate the \nsurrounding marine environment. This poses a critical threat to tourism and fisheries, both of \nwhich rely heavily on the country\u2019s pristine environment and are cornerstones to Maldives\u2019 \neconomy.5 \n \n4.  Existing waste collection, transfer, and disposal. Waste Management Corporation \nLimited is the state-owned operator contracted for collecting waste in Mal\u00e9, while in outer islands \nthis is carried out by island councils. These institutions neither have sufficient capacity nor \nadequate equipment and infrastructure for efficient collection and transfer of waste, such as \nrefuse bins, trucks, and formal transfer stations. Collected waste is transported to Thilafushi island \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Maldives, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n2  The Greater Mal\u00e9 region includes Mal\u00e9, Hulhumal\u00e9, Villingili, and the industrial islands: Thilafushi and Gulhi Falhu. \n3  Government of Maldives, National Bureau of Statistics; and United Nations Population Fund. 2018. Maldives \nPopulation Projections 2014\u20132054: Assumptions and Results Analysis. Mal\u00e9. \n4  Out of the total waste generated, about 300 tpd are suitable for incineration. The remaining quantity is mostly inert \nconstruction and demolition waste. Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure \nServices (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  Tourism is the largest and most rapidly expanding industry, accounting for 25% of gross domestic product (2018). \nAs of 2014, one-quarter of the country\u2019s employment is in tourism and fisheries. ADB. 2019. Maldives Economic \nUpdate 2019. Manila.  \n ", "2 \nin open vessels, resulting in significant spillage in the ocean. On Thilafushi island, waste is \ndumped with no treatment and often burned in the open. Construction and demolition waste, and \nend-of-life vehicles are not collected and processed separately. \n \n5.  No treatment and disposal infrastructure. There is no infrastructure to systematically \ntreat and dispose the waste generated in the project area. This is a critical priority to improve \npublic health and the environment. Given scarcity of land, there is a need to reduce volume of \nwaste for final disposal. There are only 15 ha of land available for solid waste treatment and \ndisposal, which the government had to reclaim in 2018 from the adjacent lagoon close to the \nThilafushi island dump site because of insufficient space. Energy recovery from waste with \nelectricity generation is an important opportunity given that the country is mostly powered by \nimported diesel, which has a high production cost ($0.30\u2013$0.70 per kilowatt-hour) and high \ngreenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity.6 Therefore, Maldives is vulnerable to oil price \nvariations in the Asia and Pacific region (footnote 6). \n \n6.  Climate and disaster risks. Maldives is physically vulnerable to climate and disaster risks \ngiven its low elevation of 1.5 meters above sea level. The Indian Ocean tsunami in December \n2004 dispersed about 290,000 cubic meters of waste from open dump sites on land, including \nmunicipal and hazardous waste.7 Natural hazards such as extreme rainfall and severe storm \nsurges pose risks to infrastructure and the continuity of service provision. As climate change is \nexpected to exacerbate these hazards, it is necessary to protect systems through disaster- and \nclimate-resilient project designs.8 \n \n7.  Policy framework  and  strategy  for  solid waste  management.  The  government\u2019s \nStrategic  Action  Plan,  2019\u20132023  recognizes  SWM  as  the  most  visible  and  pressing \nenvironmental issue and details policy actions to promote waste as a valuable resource, including \nthe establishment of regional waste management facilities and WTE.9 The strategic action plan \nalso prioritizes strengthening waste management in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region. The project is fully \naligned with the strategic action plan and the National SWM Policy (2015)10 and the Waste \nManagement Regulation (No 2013/R-58), which outline key principles of SWM and environmental \nquality.11 In 2019, the government established the Maldives Green Fund (MGF) to enhance \ninvestments in environmental improvement, including SWM.12 A financing plan for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) services, including clear responsibilities, revenue enhancement measures, \nand  fund  flows,  will  need  to  be  established  to  improve  service  sustainability.  In  terms  of \ninstitutional arrangements, the Waste Management and Pollution Control Department of the \nMinistry of Environment (MOE) is mandated to provide safe waste disposal on all inhabited islands, \n \n6  ADB. 2014.

The fund\u2019s revenues are from a green tax, which is payable by tourists who stay in resorts, hotels, and \ntourist vessels at the rate of $6 per day of stay, and in guesthouses at the rate of $3 per day of stay. During 2019, \nthe government received $59 million in green tax against total outflows of $21 million, resulting in a balance of $38 \nmillion.

Both institutions require better capacity to manage and \nmonitor WTE operations. The MOE works closely with development partners to improve SWM, \nand requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) because of its experience in the \nurban sector and SWM (footnote 11). \n \n8.  Strategic  approach.  The  project  will  focus  on  solid  waste  treatment  and  disposal \ninfrastructure as part of a phased approach to provide a full-fledged SWM service to the project \narea through two ADB projects. It will complement the ongoing Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental \nImprovement and Waste Management Project, approved by ADB in 2018, which is assisting the \ngovernment to (i) improve the upstream segment of the SWM chain, including systemic collection \nand containerized transfer; (ii) implement temporary measures, such as baling of municipal solid \nwaste, as an adequate interim solution to stop open dumping and burning on Thilafushi island \nuntil a modern solid waste treatment and disposal facility is operational; (iii) treat and recover \nconstruction and demolition waste; and (iv) strengthen institutional capacity and public awareness \nfor sustainable SWM service delivery.13 ADB and the government agreed on this phased strategy \nto match the implementation and financing capacity of the government, and to improve project \nreadiness  of  the  complex  WTE  infrastructure  (i.e.,  reclaim  15  ha  of  land,  take  advance \nprocurement  actions,  and  conduct  an  environmental  impact  assessment  [EIA])  while \nimplementing urgent measures. Implementation of the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand Waste Management Project is on track as of 2020 Q1 validation. The collection and transfer \nsystem development and existing dump site improvement (under the ongoing project) are under \nimplementation  and  expected  to  be  completed  by  2023,  1  year  prior  to  the  expected \ncommissioning of the WTE plant. \n \n9.  Private sector. The private sector is expected to substantially contribute to the project \nthrough a design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) contract, which allocates technical risk to a private \ncompany and leverages its know-how for efficient design, construction, and O&M of WTE facilities. \nPrivate sector participation will be pivotal to bring the innovative solutions and efficiency required \nto address the complex challenges of providing SWM services in the project area, including \nlogistic and resource constraints, and to sustain service delivery through a long-term contract. A \nbuild\u2013own\u2013transfer contract for SWM services in the project area was attempted in 2011 but \ncanceled in 2014, as the conditions precedent were not met because of various issues, including \ntechnology selection and the contractor\u2019s slow progress. The government prefers to retain \nownership and finance the project through public funds, also in view of high perceived financing \nand commercial risks because of the project\u2019s remote location, site constraints, and the low tariff \nfor solid waste treatment services. \n \n10.  Alignment with ADB priorities. The project is aligned with the operational priorities (OP) \nof ADB Strategy 2030 as it will (i) enhance livability and environmental sustainability, including air \nquality and ocean health in the project area, as well as  mitigate climate change (OPs 3 and 4); \n(ii) improve infrastructure resilience to disaster and climate risks (OP 3); and (iii) strengthen \ninstitutional capacity and standards for service delivery, and improve public awareness on \nsustainable waste management, targeting women (OPs 2, 4 and 6).14 The project is also in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies, as it will reduce \n \n13 ADB. 2018.

", "4 \nland-based sources of marine pollution, including plastics, through adopting proven high-level \ntechnology and strengthening institutions for improved SWM.15 \n \n11.  Lessons. Lessons from implementation of previous projects in Maldives are incorporated \nin the project design. These are: (i) include long-term O&M in contracts to improve service \ncontinuity and sustainability; (ii) provide adequate preparation support to avoid downstream \ndelays;16 (iii)  provide  capacity  support  to  project  management  unit  (PMU)  staff  in  project \nimplementation,  particularly  in  procurement,  contract  management,  and  safeguards; 17 (iv) \ncomplement infrastructure investments with strong capacity building for O&M; (v) promote strong \ncommunity consultation and awareness on 3R, targeting women;18 and (vi) incorporate disaster \nrisk reduction and climate change-resilient measures into project designs.  \n \n12.  Project relevance amid coronavirus disease. The project remains highly relevant in \ntimes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic crisis considering its importance in limiting \nthe spread of infectious diseases through the provision of sanitary treatment of solid waste, \nincluding medical waste. The project\u2019s positive impact on the environment and ocean health will \ncontribute to the medium-term recovery of the tourism industry, which has been badly affected by \nthe pandemic. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: waste as a valuable resource for income \ngeneration promoted (footnote 9). The project will have the following outcome: solid waste \ntreatment and disposal services improved in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region and its outer islands.19  \n \n14.  Output  1:  Disaster-  and  climate-resilient  regional  waste  management  facility \ndeveloped. This will include (i) a 500 tpd WTE plant with 15 years of O&M, including two \ntreatment lines of 250 tpd each, a minimum 8-megawatt (MW) electricity surplus energy recovery \nfacility, and an air pollution control system; and (ii) a landfill for safe disposal of hazardous air \npollution control residues and non-marketable bottom ashes.20 The facility (WTE plant and landfill) \nwill be implemented through a DBO contract to a specialized firm, which will integrate a design\u2013\nbuild phase and a 15-year operation (O&M) phase to improve sustainability of service delivery. \nThe facility will be able to accommodate a third 250 tpd treatment line in the future, which will be \nrequired to respond to further demand increase. The incineration with electricity generation (WTE) \ntechnology minimizes land requirements and produces renewable energy, addressing the critical \nland and electricity constraints in Maldives. Recycling of marketable incineration bottom ash and \nmetals will be promoted to further reduce landfill requirements and provide valuable materials for \nthe construction and recycling industry. All facilities will adopt disaster- and climate-resilient \nfeatures, such as raised floor elevations, flood-proof mechanical and electrical equipment and \nlandfill cells, and enhanced drainage systems (footnote 8). \n \n15.

This will include (i) preparing and implementing a capacity development plan \nto improve the capacity of MOE and EPA to supervise sustainable WTE service delivery; (ii) \nstrengthening MOE and EPA staff capacity in supervising WTE operations, including monitoring \nWTE operational performance and environmental standards, and managing performance-based \nDBO  contract;  (iii)  supporting  enhanced  financial  sustainability  for  WTE  O&M  through \nimplementation of an agreed O&M financing plan, including financial need forecasting and \nfinalization of financing sources, a revenue enhancement plan, assignment of responsibilities, \nand  fund  flow  arrangements  for  payment  of  O&M;  and  (iv)  conducting  public  awareness \ncampaigns on WTE and 3R benefits. The project will develop PMU and government capacity to \nprepare,  monitor,  and  manage  sustainable  WTE  through  consulting  services  for  contract \nmanagement, monitoring, supervision, and institutional development. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n16.  The project complements the ongoing Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement and \nWaste Management Project and assists the government to provide a full-fledged SWM service to \nthe project area through proven high-level waste treatment and disposal infrastructure, suitable \nfor a small island country context and with positive benefits for ocean health. ADB took the leading \nrole to mobilize the co-financing from AIIB and JFJCM to fully finance the project and maximize \nits development impact. The project is synergistic with other development partners\u2019 initiatives in \nthe country that are supporting sustainable SWM in other areas of Maldives and strengthening \nSWM legislation (footnote 11). ADB is closely coordinating with the Islamic Development Bank, \nwhich is processing a loan with an indicative amount of $20.00 million for rehabilitating the \nThilafushi island dump site (adjacent to the project site) and developing a transfer station in \nHulhumal\u00e9. \n \n17.  ADB  contributed  to  formulating  critical  components  to  project  design,  including  (i) \nsustainable SWM strategies and solutions suitable for reducing ocean pollution in a small island \ncontext; (ii) adoption of the DBO modality to tap private sector know-how for efficient and \ninnovative solutions, allocate risk properly, and ensure sustainability of service provision given \nthe low capacity of the government to operate a complex WTE facility; (iii) incorporation of proven \nhigh-level technology and operational standards into the WTE DBO contract to ensure quality \ninfrastructure,21 value for money, and high technical and environmental performance during \noperations; (iv) strategic procurement initiatives, such as market sounding to understand WTE \nmarkets and ensure good competition in a small island country context; (v) capacity support for \nprocurement, contract management, safeguards, and O&M to procure and manage complex WTE \nDBO contracts; (vi) development of an O&M financing plan to establish a clear fund flow \narrangement and financing strategy for sustainable O&M; (vii) key designs to improve project \nresilience to climate and disaster risks (footnote 8); and (viii) community consultation and public \nawareness on WTE and 3R. With the support of ADB\u2019s High-Level Technology Fund, ADB (i) \nfacilitated a knowledge exchange program with the Clean Authority of Tokyo for the Government \nof Maldives to learn how to adopt proven high-level technologies and service standards, and (ii) \nsupported the preparation of a draft regulatory framework and standards for WTE in Maldives. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The project will follow the same implementation arrangements as the Greater Mal\u00e9 \nEnvironmental Improvement and Waste Management Project. The project steering committee will \nprovide overall policy and strategic guidance to the project. The project technical committee will \ncoordinate design and implementation issues. The implementing agency, through the PMU, will \nrecruit consulting firms to support project management, supervision, capacity building, and \ncommunity awareness. As the project is partially financed by ADB-administered cofinancing \nresources,  universal  procurement  will  apply. 23  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 22). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2020\u2013September 2026 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2026 \nEstimated loan and grants  31 March 2027 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Project steering committee \nThe minister of environment or a senior official designated by the minister, \nMOE (chair) \nRepresentatives from: the MOF; Ministry of National Planning and \nInfrastructure; Ministry of Housing and Urban Development; WAMCO; \nMinistry of Tourism; Ministry of Health, Ministry of Gender, Family and \nSocial Services; Local Government Authority, Environmental Protection \nAgency; STELCO; and Mal\u00e9 City Council  \nTechnical committee \nProject director, MOE (chair) \nRepresentatives from: the MOE, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Health, \nLocal Government Authority, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, \n \n23 ADB. 2013.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) attached to the project will (i) strengthen the \ninstitutional capacity of the MOE and EPA to supervise WTE service delivery; (ii) support \nimprovement of financial sustainability for WTE service delivery; and (iii) provide implementation \nsupport  to  the  PMU  in  contract  management,  performance  monitoring,  compliance  with \nsafeguards requirements, and financial management during the design and build period (of the \nWTE DBO contract). The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).24 The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The \nMOF will be the executing agency and the MOE will be the implementing agency for the TA, which \nwill be implemented over 4.5 years. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of the project, comprising \nfeasibility studies, preliminary DBO designs and suggested technologies, cost estimates, and site \ninvestigations. Technical aspects of the project were appraised based on (i) rationale and \nrelevance, benefits, proposed designs, ease, and sustainability of implementation and operations; \n(ii) technical alternatives and their viability (the MOE evaluated a range of treatment technologies \nto choose the best practicable environmental option and promote service continuity); (iii) the life \ncycle costs (including capital and operating costs) and achievable cost savings (including climate- \nand disaster-resilient measures); (iv) minimization of adverse environmental and social impacts; \nand (v) optimization of timelines for implementation through high project readiness. The project \ndesign is robust and adequately addresses the key solid waste treatment and disposal issues \nfacing the project area, positively impacting ocean health. The project design, including cost \nestimates and the implementation schedule, accommodates possible delays or cost increases \nbecause of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains. \n \n24 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n25.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  the  economic  feasibility  of \ninterventions  proposed  under  the  project.  The  economic  analysis  shows  the  project  to  be \neconomically viable, with a calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.8%, which \nexceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9%. The economic viability of this project will \nincrease further if unquantifiable benefits, such as environmental improvements, are included in \nthe analysis. The project\u2019s EIRR is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital for all \nadverse sensitivity scenarios considered for the analysis, including a worst-case scenario where \nthere is no overhead connection to Gulhi Falhu island (for full electricity utilization), and the grid \nenergy demand on Thilafushi island remains 2 MW in 2025 (an EIRR of 10.8%), which is very \nconservative.25 Construction of the WTE plant along with strengthening of institutional capacity \nand community awareness on sustainable waste management will benefit about 350,000 people \nfrom 2026. The estimated poverty impact ratio is 32.6%.26 \n \n26.  Financial  analysis.  Financial  analysis  of  the  project  was  conducted  as  per  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.27 The project is expected to substantially cover (96%) O&M costs through different \nrevenue sources (sales of electricity, metals, and bottom ash, and tipping fee from resort waste). \nThe government is committed to cover any shortfalls in O&M costs. The WTE plant will have four \ndifferent sources of revenue: (i) proceeds from sales of electricity,28 (ii) proceeds from sales of \nmetals, (iii) proceeds from sales of incineration bottom ash, and (iv) tipping fees from resort waste \ndelivered to Thilafushi island. The government-owned State Electric Company Limited plans to \npurchase electricity, and the construction and recycling industries are potential markets for bottom \nash and metals. Estimated annual revenue from the sale of different by-products from the WTE \nplant  and  tipping  fees from  resort  waste  will  cover  a substantial  part  of  the  annual O&M \nrequirements under the DBO contract (96% per annum on average). In the worst-case scenario \n(para. 25), the O&M cost recovery will decrease to 43% per annum on average. Potential budget \nshortfalls to pay any O&M gap pose a substantial financial sustainability risk. To address this risk, \nthe government (i) will cover any O&M shortfall either through funds from the MGF (footnote 12) \nor other budgetary allocations; and (ii) has agreed to an O&M financing plan (para. 15), which will \nbe finalized 1 year before commencement of O&M with support from the project. In the medium \nto long term, the MOE is also committed to moving toward a full O&M cost recovery and polluters-\npay approach, and is planning to collect a tipping (treatment) fee for waste delivered to the WTE \nfacility, which is currently not in place (except for resorts delivering waste to Thilafushi island). \nAlthough a revenue deficit was recorded each year from 2014 to 2019, the Government of \nMaldives is taking adequate steps to reduce the deficit through fiscal regulatory measures. Also, \nthe increasing budget allocation to environmental protection, the introduction of a green tax, and \nthe establishment of the MGF, which all occurred during 2014\u20132019, underline the government\u2019s \ncommitment to the sustainability of SWM projects. \n \n \n \n25 An overhead connection to Gulhi Falhu island (the nearest island, at a distance 300 meters) is planned to fully utilize \nenergy from the WTE plant as the base case. Current grid demand on Thilafushi island is 2 MW, but total power \ndemand on the island is more than 4 MW, as most industries have private diesel generators. Grid demand on \nThilafushi island is expected to grow considerably with expansion of the power grid and planned developments on \nthe island. Government of Maldives, MOE. 2020.

", "10 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n27.  Solid  waste  treatment  and  disposal  services  established  under  the  project  will  be \nmaintained through a long-term O&M phase under the DBO contract with a specialized WTE \noperator,  which  will  also  design  and  build  the  facilities.  The  contract  has  12  measurable \noperational  performance  guarantees,  including  service  quality,  efficiency,  environmental \nstandards, and damages, as effective leverage mechanisms for compliance. The MOE and EPA \nwill supervise O&M performance, as they are the most suitable institutions with technical skills \nand experience in SWM projects and environmental monitoring. The MOE will take over the WTE \nplant after the 15-year O&M period. The project will also strengthen the monitoring and contract \nmanagement capacity of the MOE and EPA, which is necessary because of the complexity of the \nWTE plant and its operations. Economic and financial sustainability will be ensured through the \nsale of electricity, metals, and bottom ash from the WTE plant; collection of a resort waste tipping \nfee; and government\u2019s transfers to cover any O&M shortfall and plan to enhance O&M cost \nrecovery over the medium to long term (para. 26). If there is any indication that full energy \nutilization is unlikely at the time of WTE facility commissioning, other options to utilize energy, \nincluding desalination and hydrogen production, will be further explored to improve project \nbenefits and sustainability. Effective SWM treatment services established under the project will \nminimize pollution and decrease the use of natural resources, thereby improving the environment, \nespecially ocean health, with substantial spillovers to the tourism and fishery sectors that will help \ntheir recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic (footnote 5). \n \nD.  Governance \n \n28.  Financial management. A financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted in \naccordance with ADB guidelines (footnote 27). The FMA considered the financial management \ncapacity of the MOE and its PMU, and covered the areas of fund flow arrangements, staffing, \nbudgeting, accounting and financial reporting systems, internal control procedures, financial \ninformation systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The FMA found that the \nMOE and its PMU have adequate financial management capacity to (i) record the required \nfinancial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports in a timely \nmanner, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The PMU is implementing the Greater Mal\u00e9 \nEnvironmental Improvement and Waste Management Project, and the first audit report was \nunqualified and submitted on time. However, the FMA identified the following risks: (i) insufficient \nstaff in the PMU accounts section to handle multiple projects simultaneously, (ii) PMU accounts \nsection staff lacks training in ADB procedures and systems, (iii) complex financing structure with \nseveral financiers, (iv) absence of an effective internal audit function, (v) insufficient interim \nfinancial analysis and reporting, and (vi) project transactions are not recorded using proper \naccounting software. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. \n \n29.  These risks will be mitigated through an agreed action plan involving (i) appointing \nadditional financial staff or an account officer to support the PMU in handling the additional \nworkload during the period when implementation of the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand Waste Management Project, and implementation of the Greater Mal\u00e9 Waste-to-Energy \nProject  overlap;  (ii)  providing  training  on  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements, \ndisbursement procedures, and systems; (iii) including comprehensive financial information in the \nquarterly project progress reports; (iv) strengthening the MOE\u2019s internal audit function; and (v) \nprocuring accounting software for the PMU to use. The MOE will maintain separate books of \naccounts for the project following the International Public Sector Accounting Standards under the \ncash basis of accounting, and the project financial statements will be audited annually by the \nAuditor General\u2019s Office in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. \n \n ", "11 \n30.  Procurement. Procurement of civil works and goods, including the DBO contract scope \nand consulting services, will be undertaken in conformity with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). A procurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall \nprocurement risk for the project is moderate. The MOF and MOE have extensive experience in \nprocurement of works under ADB-financed projects and those of other development partners. \n \n31.  A DBO contract for the WTE plant, including 15 years of O&M service, was selected as \noffering the best fit for the project\u2019s objectives. The MOE, supported by ADB, conducted a market \nengagement to assess interest, and the feedback was incorporated into the bidding document, \nincreasing the probability of optimal competition. The evaluation criteria adopted assesses life \ncycle costs of the WTE plant, including the guaranteed energy generation, and the contract \nconditions include various environmental performance guarantees. The strategic integration of \nthese key aspects contributes to achieving value for money. \n \n32.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government (and the MOF and MOE). The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). Based on \nthe risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures incorporated in the project design aim to \n(i) establish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of relevant information; (ii) develop and \nupdate  a  website  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and \nsafeguards; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to provide effective resolutions to \ngrievances, if any. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  In 2016, poverty in Maldives was estimated at 8.2%, with poverty levels in the project area \nof 1.7% in Mal\u00e9 city and Vaavu Atoll; 8.0% in Alifu Dhaalu Atoll; 15.7% in Kaafu Atoll; and 16.5% \nin Alifu Alifu Atoll.29 The project includes improved waste management benefiting poor outer \nisland communities. The project will result in a cleaner environment, positively impacting fishing \nand tourism-based livelihoods, on which many of the poor depend. \n \n34.  Gender. The project is classified as having some gender elements. The design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) include indicators related to the training of eligible staff and \nthe generation of public awareness with some gender elements. In addition, the project design \nwill ensure the provision of male, female, and all-gender and barrier-free toilets at the WTE plant \nand other project facilities, and this will be a contractual requirement in the DBO contract. No \nseparate gender action plan has been prepared. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n36.  Environment (category A). The draft EIA, including an environmental management plan \n(EMP), was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 24 December 2019. The construction and operation \nof a large WTE facility has potential significant adverse impacts that may affect an area larger \nthan the sites or facilities subject to physical works. The findings of the EIA are as follows: (i) the \nproject will result in significant environmental benefits because open dumping and burning of solid \nwaste will be stopped in the project area; (ii) during construction, the project will not have \n \n29 The national poverty line is Rf74 per day.

", "12 \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable \nthrough the effective implementation of the EMP; (iii) during operations, potential impacts are on \nambient air quality, marine water quality, noise, and occupational and community health and \nsafety. However, with the performance guarantees embedded in the DBO contract, significant \nimpacts can be avoided, and residual impacts can be mitigated by measures specified in the EMP; \nand (iv) the project will have no social impacts pertaining to land loss, land fragmentation, physical \ndisplacement, loss of income, loss of productive land, potential income loss for fishers, and \nprevention of fishing-related activities and fishing routes.31 \n \n37.  The MOE conducted public consultations from 2017 to 2019 with local communities, \ngovernment authorities, and nongovernment organizations (ADB participated as observer to two \nconsultations);  their  feedback  was  considered  during  project  design.32 The  EPA  provided \nenvironmental  clearance  in  January  2020  adopting  the  conditions  described  in  the EIA.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism was established for the Greater Mal\u00e9 Environmental Improvement \nand Waste Management Project and the PMU notified the public that the same mechanism will \nbe used for the project. The project will ensure that members of the grievance redress committee, \nthe PMU, and the contractor will be provided with trainings to address project-related grievances. \nThe PMU has a dedicated environment officer and will receive capacity support from consultants \nto ensure sufficient monitoring and management of environmental impacts. The EMP will be part \nof the DBO contract for WTE, giving contractor responsibility and resources for implementation, \nunder the oversight of the PMU. The PMU will retain external environmental experts to monitor \nthe implementation of the project\u2019s EMP and compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nand conditions of the environmental clearance.  \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The MOE prepared a draft due diligence report, \nwhich found no permanent or temporary resettlement impacts resulting from the project, as all \nworks are proposed within the available government land reclaimed on Thilafushi island. A field \nvisit to the project site and stakeholder consultations confirmed the findings reported in the draft \ndue diligence report.33 \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have impacts on \nindigenous peoples. Project due diligence confirmed that there are no indigenous peoples present \nat or around the project site. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n40.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The FMA in the PAM (footnote 22) \noutlines other detailed risks and mitigation measures related to financial management. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLogistics, sourcing challenges, and price A longer implementation period will accommodate possible project \nsurges of materials beyond projections  delays, including those caused by COVID-19 pandemic and its \ndue to remote context and COVID-19  impacts on global supply chains.

Incineration bottom ashes are either recycled \nand sold to the construction or recycling industry, or disposed to landfill. \nd  In the first year of operation, annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tCO2-eq/year) is estimated to be 28,000 \ntCO2-eq/year due start up period of the plant. Greenhouse gas emission offset by the WTE plant will increase over \nthe years of operations and estimated to amount to 40,000 tCO2-eq/year on average over 20 years of operations. \ne  According to European Union renewable energy directive (2009/28/EC), the biodegradable fraction of municipal \nand industrial waste is considered biomass, and is thus a renewable energy source. On the average, the energy \noutput from WTE plants is about 50% renewable. \nf   Includes two treatment lines of 250 tons-per-day each, a minimum 8-megawatt (MW) electricity surplus energy \nrecovery facility, and an air pollution control system  \ng  Implemented through a DBO contract, which will include a design and build phase, and a 15-year O&M phase. ADB \nwill finance the design and build phase. The government will finance the full cost of the O&M phase. The DBO \ncontract includes the waste-to-energy plant (1a) and landfill for disposal of WTE APC residues and non-marketable \nbottom ashes (1b).  \nh  These include: (i) elevating base floor to 2.2 m of critical structures and facilities, (ii) enhancing capacity of drainage \nsystems; (iii) enhancing stability and impermeability of landfill berms; (iv) flood-proofing critical mechanical and \nelectrical systems and establishing redundancy; (v) protecting stormwater throughout pumps and backflow inverters; \n(vi) protecting key civil structures against buoyancy; and (vii) strengthening critical and elevated structures to \nwithstand Category 2 cyclone and  intensity V Modified Mercalli Intensity earthquake scale. \ni   To be supported under attached TA. \nContribution to the ADB Results Framework: \nRFI 3.1: Total annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction (tons of CO2 equivalent per tCO2-eq/year).
