INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) is included in the 2012\u20132014 country operations business \nplan for Mongolia.1 A fact-finding mission visited Ulaanbaatar in March 2012 and agreement \nwas reached with the government on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs and financing, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s economic outlook is bright, but there is a risk that the focus on development \nof the mining sector will lead to neglect of other parts of the economy and result in greater \ndisparities  in  income  and  access  to  basic  services.  Rapid  economic  growth  has  been \naccompanied by falling poverty rates, but there is growing realization among stakeholders in the \ncountry that (i) inequality is rising; (ii) job creation is critical for addressing inequality; and (iii) \nthere is a need to raise awareness and understanding, and strengthen policy formulation to \nensure inclusive growth in Mongolia. \n \n3.  Despite high overall economic growth rates in many Asian countries since the 1990s, \nmany  policy  makers  in  Asia  and  in  international  organizations  have  become  increasingly \nconcerned that this growth has been too uneven and often accompanied by rising income \ninequality. Disadvantaged groups, including members of ethnic minorities, people in remote \nrural  locations,  and  women,  have  not  benefited  proportionately  from  rapid  economic \nadvancement.3 The realization that the process of growth often leaves poor and disadvantaged \npeople behind is becoming increasingly relevant in political debates and in economic and social \npolicy formulation. \n \n4.  Growth in Mongolia is expected to continue to be strong in 2012 and beyond, supported \nby high global mineral prices, development of new mines, and fiscal spending. Fiscal policy is \nexpected  to  be  expansionary  in  the  coming  years,  increasing  inflationary  pressures  and \ncrowding out non-mineral industries. Evidence shows that resource dependence often leads to \neconomic inequality, as resource extraction creates relatively few jobs, while commodity rents \naccrue to a relatively small portion of the population. High inequality may, in turn, negatively \naffect development prospects as many talented people have little or no access to education and \ncapital. High inequality may also undermine social cohesion and result in social unrest. \n \n5.  Protecting  people  with  low  skills  and  income  from  the  impact  of  high  inflation  and \nenabling their full participation in economic growth through greater employment and access to \ncore public services is a key government responsibility. Strategy 2020 identifies inclusive growth \nas one of ADB\u2019s three strategic pillars along with environmental sustainability and regional \nintegration. It emphasizes the need to promote a development strategy which (i) provides \ngreater  access  to  opportunities  by  expanding  human  capacities  through  investments  in \neducation, health, and basic social protection; (ii) improves the poor\u2019s access to markets and \nbasic productive assets by putting in place sound policies and institutions; and (iii) strengthens \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

This necessitates consensus and capacity building at the national and local levels and \nthe development of clear road maps for policies and programs.  \n \n6.  To support inclusive growth, the government is supporting inclusion by strengthening \nvocational  training,  increasing  social  security  coverage,  promoting  employment  for \ndisadvantaged  groups,  and  investing  in  disadvantaged  urban  areas.  These  need  to  be \ncomplemented by policy development capacity and a long-term strategy focused on achieving \ninclusive  growth  to  (i) create  and  expand  economic  opportunities  (mainly  productive \nemployment); and (ii) ensure broader access to these opportunities for members of society to \nparticipate in and benefit from growth (footnote 4). Currently, there is limited public debate and \nunderstanding of the consequences of social and economic inequality; no monitoring and a lack \nof capacity across various sectors (government, private sector, media, civil society) to define \nand monitor progress toward inclusive growth; and weak policy and development capacity to be \nable to address inclusive growth in key sectors. Identifying and addressing such constraints will \nsupport inclusive growth and good governance.  \n \n7.  Since 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in cooperation with Japan International \nCooperation Agency and the World Bank, has supported modernization of the social welfare \nsystem  in  Mongolia  by  improving  targeting  methodologies  and  introducing  social  transfers \ndirectly targeted at the poor.7 As a second step, poor and marginalized households need to be \nbrought into the formal labor market to obtain decent and productive jobs to sustain their living \nstandards. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  that  Mongolia\u2019s  medium-term  strategic  plan  and  the \ncorresponding yearly socioeconomic development guidelines reflect inclusive growth policies. \nThe outcome will be the improved capacity to develop policies on inclusive growth among key \npublic and private stakeholders. The overall objective of the TA is to promote inclusive growth \nstrategies in selected socioeconomic sectors of Mongolia.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To increase the capacity to develop policies on inclusive growth among key public and \nprivate stakeholders, the TA will (i) identify the main drivers of inequality and constraints to more \ninclusiveness in Mongolia, (ii) conduct a consultative process to identify key constraints to \ninclusive growth involving key public and private stakeholders to support these efforts, (iii) \nimprove  institutional  and  human  capacity  for  inclusive  growth  in  selected  government  and \nprofessional business entities, and (iv) provide policy recommendations on inclusive growth and \nfuture project investments in priority areas.  \n \n10.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under four outputs:  \n(i)  Output 1: Analysis of inclusiveness of growth. Analytical work under this \noutput will focus on identifying the key drivers of inequality. This analysis will \ndirectly  lead  to  recommendations  for  policy  reforms  and  programmatic \ninterventions  for  key  sectors  under  output  4.  A  priority  area  will  be  critical \nanalysis of existing labor market mechanisms and their capacity to fully engage \nthe private sector and match supply to demand. \n(ii)  Output 2: Consultative process for inclusiveness of growth. These activities \nwill engage the public and a wide range of stakeholders in a participatory process \nto identify key constraints to inclusiveness of growth in Mongolia. Pre- and post-\nsurveys  will  be  implemented  to  determine  changes  in  capacity  to  develop \ninclusive growth policies. Awareness and capacity building activities such as \nhosting  debates  with  international  experts  and  creating  capacity  building \nmaterials  and  tools  will  ensure  that  understanding  of  concepts  particularly \nsignificant for Mongolia and experience of other countries are shared with the \ngovernment, private sector, and civil society stakeholders. \n(iii)  Output 3: Institutional and human capacity development. Activities under this \noutput  will  address  capacity  issues  and  develop  tools  for  a  broad  range  of \nstakeholders in selected government and professional business entities at the \nnational as well as the local level. This includes institutional development for the \nCabinet Office, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment  (MED)  on  mechanisms  and  indicators  for  monitoring  inclusive \ngrowth in government monitoring systems. It also includes activities to increase \npolicy makers\u2019 and business community members\u2019 capacity for policy analysis, \nidentifying  constraints  to  and  addressing  inclusiveness.  The  capacity \ndevelopment activities will help participants to develop policies and plans, and \nimplement and monitor specific programs focusing on inclusive growth. A pilot \nproject to support decentralized procurement through capacity building will be \nconducted under this output in collaboration with Japan International Cooperation \nAgency and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.8 The pilot \nproject will build on two important legal initiatives of the government in 2011 that \nwill support inclusive growth: (i) the law on integrated budget that promotes the \n                                                 \n8  The collaboration will be implemented as follows: (i) the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation will \nsupport decentralization of the budget authority by providing capacity building activities to local government and \ncivil society in budgeting, planning, and prioritization; (ii) ADB will provide capacity building to small and medium-\nsized enterprises, local government, and civil society in procurement processes; and (iii) Japan International \nCooperation Agency will assist the MOF in establishing audit units to supervise the decentralization process. The \ncombined support will improve the use of decentralized budgets, stimulate the local economy, and create jobs. The \noutput will be actionable recommendations to the Procurement Policy Division of the MOF on how to support \ndecentralized procurement, including oversight by civil society. \n ", "4   \ndecentralization of budget authority, and (ii) the amended law on procurement \nthat promotes local procurement. The amended procurement law (effective in \nOctober 2012) calls for services and materials for local government development \nand investment programs to begin to be procured from local small and medium-\nsized enterprises. The intention is to facilitate local development and develop \nskills  among  local  service  providers\u2014supporting  economic  growth  in  areas \nbeyond major urban centers and large service providers.  \n(iv)  Output  4:  Policy  and  inclusiveness  of  growth  investment  strategy \ndevelopment.  Activities  under  this  output  will  contribute  to  inclusive  policy \ndevelopment in key sectors and identify potential project investments to promote \ninclusive growth. Policy formulation will rest on the analysis of inclusiveness of \ngrowth (output 1), the results of the consultative process (output 2), and specific \nactivities under output 4. To assist in policy formulation, the TA will explore best \ninternational policy practices for inclusive growth from resource-rich countries, \nstudy corporate social responsibility practices, and implement a pilot project to \nincrease access to employment for urban and rural poor households that have \nbeen identified by the national proxy means test.9 Lessons from the TA will be \ncaptured in a knowledge product on promoting inclusiveness in growth that will \nidentify  the  drivers  and  policy  recommendations  and  propose  investment \nprograms and strategies in priority sectors to support inclusive growth.10 The pilot \nproject will be conducted in collaboration with Japan International Cooperation \nAgency and will build on the passage of the labor enhancement law in 2011, \nwhich includes a provision for providing government subsidies to companies that \nemploy  poor  households.  This  will  help  create  a  surer  path  and  more \nopportunities for the poor to be able to transfer from being recipients of welfare \npayments to being employed in the formal sector.11 \n \n11.  Government support to promote inclusive growth is strong; it is assumed that public \nsupport will continue and private sector stakeholders will be engaged in developing policies on \ninclusive growth. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The Government of \nMongolia will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, remuneration \nand per diem of counterpart staff, and administrative support.  \n \n                                                 \n9 The ADB-funded Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project has supported implementation of a \nnational proxy means test to identify poor households. The resulting database is being used to target social welfare \nprograms such as the food stamp and medicard programs (supported by ADB). It is expected that the database will \neventually support targeting of other programs such as education or energy subsidies or access to employment \nand skills building programs. \n10 Potential investments to promote inclusive growth include improvement of water and sanitation in ger (traditional \ntent) areas of Ulaanbaatar, expansion of power and heating supply systems, access to finance, business support \nsystems, development of the hospitality infrastructure in poorer areas of Mongolia, and expansion of the school \nand hospital systems. \n11 The collaboration will be implemented as follows: (i) ADB will carry out an analysis of the local labor market and \nassess the effectiveness of local employment services; and (ii) Japan International Cooperation Agency will \nprovide a Japan overseas cooperation volunteer who will be involved in the daily implementation of the pilot project \nby contacting poor households (identified through proxy means testing), assessing their skills, providing information \nto employment services and potential employers, and documenting the pilot project. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Department of Development Financing and Cooperation of the MOF will be the \nexecuting  agency,  and  the  Department  of  Development  Policy,  Strategic  Planning  and \nCoordination of the MED will be the implementing agency for the TA.  \n14.  The  MOF  prepares  Mongolia\u2019s  yearly  socioeconomic  guidelines  and  the  MED  is \ninstitutionally responsible for preparing the medium-term strategic development plan. Hence, the \nMOF and the MED will be crucial in ensuring socioeconomic guidelines, and planning will reflect \ninclusive growth policies. Implementation of the TA will also involve the Mongolian National \nChamber of Commerce and Industry, which plays a vital role in creating links between the \nprivate sector (especially small and medium-sized enterprises) and employment seekers. It will \nhelp in engaging business entities in inclusive growth discussions, capacity building, and policy \nformulation. \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months from March 2013 to May 2015. ADB will \nrecruit a consulting firm using quality- and cost-based selection with the standard ratio of 80:20 \nto provide 16 person-months of international and 64 person-months of national consultants, \nincluding  expertise  in  (i)  socioeconomic  analysis  and  policy  development,  (ii) consultative \nprocesses and outreach, and (iii) the development and implementation of social surveys. The \nfirm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). An administrative and technical coordinator will be recruited as an \nindividual consultant to facilitate day-to-day organizational and technical matters and liaise with \nthe executing agency. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nexecuting agency will be responsible for procurement of the TA equipment in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  will  retain  the \nequipment upon TA completion. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). A country \ndiagnostic study is being planned by the Mongolia Resident Mission and the Economic Analysis \nand Operations Support Division of ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department. The study \n(currently  planned  for  2014\u20132015)  will  analyze  (i)  the  binding  constraints  to  growth  and \nassociated policy priorities, and (ii) the critical constraints to inclusiveness of growth. The focus \nof  this  TA  is  on  the  inclusiveness  aspects.  The  TA  activities  and  knowledge  product  will \ncomplement  the  country  diagnostic  study  by  providing  clear  sectoral  recommendations  to \npromote equal opportunities to employment and project investments to support inclusiveness of \ngrowth.  \n16.  The TA will undertake a participatory process to understand key constraints to the \ninclusiveness of growth in Mongolia and ensure wide dissemination of the results among the \nkey stakeholders in the government and private sector through a series of seminars. The TA will \nalso  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  for  wider  awareness  building  and  information \ndissemination. In this regard, two high-profile workshops with international experts on inclusive \ngrowth will also be organized. The TA will prepare a knowledge product on inclusive growth in \nMongolia, including drivers of inequality, inclusive policy recommendations in key sectors, and \nproposed investment programs in priority sectors; the results will be disseminated through a \nconference and printed material. \nIV.
