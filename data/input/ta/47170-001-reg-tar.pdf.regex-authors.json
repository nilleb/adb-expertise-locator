The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund was established under \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) in June 2006, with a contribution of $20 million from the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea. The fund aims to contribute to poverty reduction and \nfoster the economic and social development process in ADB's developing member countries \n(DMCs) by supporting technical assistance (TA) projects that promote and utilize information \nand communication technology (ICT), and help facilitate the creation and sharing of information \nand knowledge.1 These activities are supported through two programs: (i) the e-Asia program \nand (ii) the knowledge partnership program.  \n \n2.  High-level  consultations  are  held  annually  between  the  government  and  ADB  for \nstocktaking and defining the future directions of the government\u2019s partnership with ADB. At the \nhigh-level consultation on 20\u201321 September 2012, the government requested a midterm review \nof the fund operations since its establishment. The review will be carried out with TA support \nand will be financed by the government through the fund. \n \n3.  Direct consultations with ADB\u2019s regional departments will be conducted to identify DMCs \nthat  will  be  included  as  case  study  countries  during  TA  implementation.  The  government \nconfirmed the TA concept through a funding approval letter dated 5 June 2013. The Ministry of \nStrategy and Finance concurred on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since its initial contribution of $20.00 million to the fund, the government has made \nadditional contributions: $6.37 million in November 2010, $6.00 million in September 2011, and \n$7.85  million  in  November  2012.  The  subsequent  contributions  suggest  there  is  growing \ndemand for the fund, increasing awareness from DMCs and ADB staff, and a continuing interest \nto support the promotion of ICT and enrichment of knowledge for development.  \n \n5.  As the fund gains more visibility, it is timely and imperative to review the midterm fund \noperations to assess the fund\u2019s responsiveness. Based on experiences from the initial six years \nof Fund operation, eligibility criteria for the fund will be sharpened, and fund administration \nprocedures will be streamlined. This will improve the performance of TA projects supported by \nthe fund and the effectiveness of fund operations. \n \n6.  In addition to the midterm review, the TA will explore potential support areas to maximize \nthe fund\u2019s development effectiveness through more systematic and demand-based interventions \nin DMCs. Considering the increasing demand for ICT from DMCs and the limited resources of \nthe TA, priority will be given to ICT that the e-Asia program supports. Therefore, the TA will \ninclude  two  components:  (i)  the  midterm  evaluation  of  fund  management  and  operational \nperformance, and (ii) the review and identification of potential areas of intervention through the \nfund. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

ADB  recognizes  the  importance  of  ICT  for  development  (ICTD)  in  its  ICT  strategy \napproved  in  2003  and  Strategy  2020.3 The  ADB  paper  Asia:  The  Road  to  Becoming  a \nKnowledge Economy also highlighted the importance of ICT as one of the pillars for knowledge-\nbased economies.4 Inclusion of the potential fund support projects into country partnership \nstrategy and/or country operations business plan could help align fund objectives with overall \nADB strategies.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved effectiveness in the economic and social development of \nDMCs.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  effectiveness  of  fund  operations  and  enhanced \nknowledge partnership with the Republic of Korea. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) the midterm evaluation report on fund operations, \n(ii) the ICTD strategy report for the e-Asia program, and (iii) the knowledge sharing of DMCs\u2019 \nICTD initiatives as part of the e-Asia program. \n(i)  Output 1. The midterm evaluation of fund operations will combine a desk review \nof case studies from TA projects financed by the fund. It will also include field \nmissions to selected DMCs.  \n(ii)  Output  2. ADB\u2019s ICTD strategy report will be formulated for selected DMCs \nthrough two steps: (a) an ICTD readiness analysis will be conducted from a \nsector  perspective  covering  key  sectors  including  ICT,  infrastructure,  public \nsector management, agriculture, finance, health, and education; and (b) an ICTD \nreadiness analysis for key sectors will be integrated into the ICTD strategy report \nfor  target  DMCs.  Output  2  will  complement  output  1  by  strengthening  the \nstrategic focus of TA fund proposals in line with the DMCs\u2019 own ICTD policies \nand strategies. \n(iii)  Output 3. In line with output 2, at least two regional knowledge sharing forums \non ICTD will be organized in collaboration with the government and international \norganizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). At one \nforum, participating DMCs for output 2 will share their ICTD experiences, ICTD \nreadiness, and discuss their ICTD policies and strategies; the second forum will \nbe  integrated  with  ADB\u2019s  ICT  for  Development  Forum  2014  to  discuss \napproaches to address development issues through the adoption of ICT, with \nparticipants from ADB, DMCs, donor agencies, development partners, and the \nprivate sector.  \n \n10.  Internal links. Given the limited TA resources and the crosscutting nature of ICT as an \nenabler  to  sector  development,  the  TA  will  selectively  target  priority  areas  including  ICT \ninfrastructure, e-governance, education, finance, health, and agriculture. The TA will also target \none or two DMCs from each region; these will be identified in consultation with ADB regional \ndepartments and through a fact-finding mission, if necessary.

A project advisory committee will be established comprising one or two \nICT focal staff from concerned regional departments, the Private Sector Operations Department, \nresident  missions,  and  coordinators  from  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment (RSDD) to materialize the output in ADB\u2019s operations. \n \n11.  External  partnerships.  Throughout  the  TA  implementation,  collaboration  with \ninternational development partners (such as ITU), the National Information Society Agency (of \nthe Republic of Korea), and private sector partners will be explored as necessary. In particular, \none of the regional forums will be jointly organized with ITU in line with its fifth Connect Asia-\nPacific Summit.5 The ADB\u2013ITU forum will take place before the summit, and the output of the \nforum will be formally announced at the summit. The summit will be a good opportunity to \ndiscuss knowledge partnerships on ICTD in Asia and the Pacific in a more action-oriented way \nrather than a symbolic declaration. \n \n12.  Output 1 will require strong support from key stakeholders in projects financed by the \nfund. However, the difficulty in finding these stakeholders could be a potential risk, which will be \nmitigated through collaboration with ADB\u2019s resident missions in the participating DMCs. For \noutput  2,  government  agencies  of  participating  DMCs  will  need  to  be  involved  actively  to \ndevelop the ICTD strategy report. The risk of supply-driven TA will be mitigated through the \nsystematic engagement of operations departments by utilizing the ICT subgroup and a project \nadvisory committee as communication channels.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and  administered  by  ADB. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency, and RSDD will implement the TA in collaboration with \ngovernment agencies such as the National Information Society Agency.6 Since the fund is \nintended to support ADB operations through TA financing, it is critical for the TA to have a \nsystematic  communication  and  collaboration  channel  with  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments. \nWithin ADB, a project advisory committee will be established to provide direction and supervise \nproject implementation; the committee will be comprised of focal ICT officers from regional \ndepartments, the Private Sector Operations Department, resident missions, and coordinators \nfrom RSDD and the Office of Information Systems and Technology. Collaboration with ITU and \n                                                \n5  The summit is organized by ITU and will take place on 18 November 2013 in Bangkok, Thailand. Four summits \nhave been organized to date, in collaboration with regional and global partners. Each summit was preceded by an \nintensive and inclusive preparatory process to include stakeholder views. Previous summits were held for Africa \n(2007), the Commonwealth of Independent States (2009), the Arab States (2012), and the Americas (2012).

The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in July 2013. Its completion \ndate is expected to be in December 2014. It will provide 14.5 person-months of international \nconsultants and 28 person-months of national consultants. A mixture of consulting firms and \nindividual consultants will be engaged following (i) the quality- and cost-based selection method \n(80:20) and (ii) simplified technical proposals by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged for output 1 (midterm evaluation report on the fund) because evaluating trust fund \noperations is not a common expertise. A consulting firm will be engaged for output 2 (ICTD \nstrategy report for the e-Asia program); however, individual consultants may be considered if no \nconsulting firm qualifies because of the broad areas of expertise required. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The progress of the TA will be evaluated against performance targets and indicators \ndefined in Appendix 1. The TA will include a joint regional forum with ITU in Bangkok and a final \nconference in Manila. A series of country workshops may be held in collaboration with the case \nstudy DMCs. \n \nIV.
