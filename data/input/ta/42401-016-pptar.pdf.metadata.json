POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe country has made significant progress in reducing poverty. Poverty incidence has fallen from 49.67% in 2001 to \n5% in 2013. Economic growth can be regarded as partly inclusive because of substantial poverty reduction, the \ndecline in regional poverty disparities, the rise in rural employment rates, and the broad-based impact on household \nconsumption in urban and rural areas. \n \nDespite this achievement, challenges remain in improving the living conditions of the population. Accessibility and \nreliability of public utilities has been identified as among the constraints to development.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (2008\u20132015),1  identified power \nsector improvement as among its strategic goals to reduce poverty. The investment program is fully consistent with \nthis goal. It is consistent with ADB's Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and the ADB Energy Policy (2009) by \npromoting inclusive growth, regional integration, energy security, and supporting energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy. \nB.     Poverty Targeting: \nGeneral Intervention  Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \nThe proposed infrastructure contributes to improvements in energy efficiency and electricity distribution services, \nbenefiting all including the poor and marginalized groups, but without specific poverty targets.  \nC.  Poverty and Social Analysis \n1.  Key issues and potential beneficiaries.  The Azerbaijan power distribution system suffers from inefficient use \nof energy resources with consequent economic and environmental drawbacks. Deficiencies and the unreliability of \npower distribution affect living conditions of households and discourage new economic activities. Households in rural \nareas, IDPs and lower income households are more disadvantaged in terms of access to a reliable power supply. \nThrough this project, more reliable power supply is expected to benefit firms and industries throughout the entire \ncountry, which will provide increased economic and job opportunities for households, including the poor and socially \nexcluded. The overall MFF will benefit 1.45 million power customers, of which 60% are residential customers. \n2.  Impact channels and expected systemic changes. The program is focused on improving the energy \nefficiency and reliability of the distribution system, which is the part of the energy system that takes generated power, \nsteps down the voltage and delivers it to households and industries. The program will also improve revenue collection \nsystems, reduce commercial losses and the load management capability of the system, hence improving the \naccessibility of all segments of population to a quality power supply. Adequate and reliable electricity supply will \nimprove the quality of life and well-being of the people. It will increase the productivity and reduce costs to small and \nmedium entrepreneurs of the current aged, unreliable system. \n \n3.  Focus of (and resources allocated in) the PPTA or due diligence.  Based on a household survey conducted \nunder the poverty and social analysis (PSA) during the PPTA in 2009, the first project tranche will directly positively \naffect 184,824 beneficiaries of which about 29% are poor (Source State Statistical Committee of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan and household survey conducted under PPTA). The proportion of poor and non-poor was determined by \nidentifying the households, by income on per capita basis, with monthly incomes that fell below the lower poverty line \n(relative poverty line) of 65 AZN. This is a higher than the national poverty headcount of 13.2% . \nThe PSA showed that most households use electrical appliances for entertainment, heating and cooling. As an \nindicator of use of labor saving devices (particularly for women\u2019s household work), in the surveyed area, only 52% of \nhouseholds use a washing machine. The most commonly used non-electrical appliances include a firewood stove, \ngas stove, kerosene lamp and other lamps for heating and lighting purposes, indications of insufficient electricity \nsupply. Most of the households (98%) were connected to national electricity grid free of cost. Overall, 75% of \n                                                \n1  Republic of Azerbaijan. 2008. State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development for 2006\u20132015. \nBaku. ", " \nhouseholds stated that the quantity of distributed electricity from the national grid is not sufficient to meet their \nhousehold electricity consumption needs. While power cuts are common, they are scheduled in a controlled manner, \nmeaning the majority of households (over 95%) are satisfied with the present service.     \n \nIn response to questions on the number and duration of power cuts and shortage of supply, 61% of respondents \nreferenced power cuts of an hour or so during the day while 35% of respondents observed power cuts of more than \none hour. Respondents noted that, due to the low voltage and inconsistency in electricity supply the use of sensitive \nappliances is difficult. About 10% of households stated that small and large electrical appliances had been damaged \ndue to the voltage fluctuations of the existing electricity supply. The cost of repair for damaged appliances is an extra \nburden; similarly extra cost is incurred for voltage stabilizers to prevent appliance damage.    \nThe Project will result in positive impacts on improved reliability of electricity supply at the household level. This, in \nturn, will lead to decreased household spending on solid/liquid fuels for heating, cooking and lighting purposes, and \nthe associated indoor air quality issues. Households will also be able to use more labor saving electrical appliances \nwithout risk of damage due to power voltage fluctuations. The project is also expected to contribute to improved \nincome generating opportunities by providing reliable electricity to small industries, and agricultural businesses. \n \nPoverty, social and gender impacts will be updated during project preparation in 2015. \nII.     GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram?  \nAzerbaijan exhibits near gender parity in some spheres (education and literacy rates) but also shows distinctive \ninequalities in terms of women\u2019s empowerment overall, especially in women\u2019s participation in public and political \nspheres, and in decision making. Azerbaijan has a Gender Inequality Index (GII) value of 0.314, ranking it 50 out of \n146 countries in the 2011 index.  Female participation in the labor market is nearly 60% compared to 67% for men, \nrelatively high compared to other CIS countries.  A broad-based gender equality law, the Law on State Guarantees \non Equal Rights for Women and Men was passed in 2006 which prohibits gender discrimination in all forms and \nprovides guarantees of gender equality in a broad range of spheres, including employment and remuneration. The \nLabor Code includes provisions on gender equality in some key aspects of employment relations although not on \npay.  There is a large gender pay gap. In 2010 the average monthly wage for women was AZN226.6, or only 54.8% \nof the men\u2019s average monthly wage (AZN413.2). The pay gap is attributed to high levels of vertical segregation in the \nlabor market. Women are also heavily concentrated in lower-paid, public sector activities such as education (67.7% \nfemale), health and social services (76.5%). \n \nGender patterns are explicit in the energy sector in Azerbaijan. Men, as heads of households, make decisions on \nsources and types of energy, even though women are the primary users of energy in the home and are therefore \nmore vulnerable to risks related to energy supply and use, and more able to benefit in terms of reduction of drudgery \nor manual tasks through use of household electrical appliances.  \n \nIn 2012, women\u2019s employment in the energy sector of Azerbaijan was only 15%. Despite the high income potential, in \n2012 there were no female private entrepreneurs in the energy sector. Women are under-represented in the energy \nsector not only in employment but also in education. The PPTA update will determine the sex disaggregated labor \nprofile of Azerishig and make suggestions for how new jobs created through the investment program can be used to \ndevelop or recruit female workers. Training for sector development activities will include 20% women. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of gender equity \nand/or empowerment of women by providing women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, \nassets, and participation in decision making? \n Yes         No    Please explain. \n \nActions  on  reduction  of  household  drudgery,  improvement  to  living  conditions,  and employment and  training \nopportunities, as outlined above. \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n  Yes          No    The above actions will decrease the possibility of entrenching sector-based gender roles by \npaying women who conduct advocacy/demand side management work and encouraging more women to \nwork in the sector.  \n \n4.
