INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strengthening  the  financial  sector  by  helping  to  develop  financial  institutions, \ninfrastructure, and products and services is a key component of Strategy 2020.1Through such \n \ninitiatives, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can support inclusive economic growth that is \nstimulated by private sector investment, which can be a key contributing factor in reducing \npoverty. Technical assistance (TA) is an important value addition that ADB can provide to \nleverage  its  nonsovereign  funding,  and  is  a  development  tool  that  is  used  frequently  and \nsuccessfully by bilateral and multilateral development banks in combination with private sector \nlending.2 For the financial sector, for instance, TA can be effectively used to help financial \ninstitutions develop or test new products; these activities, which financial institutions would not \nnormally undertake, can widen access to finance for underserved customer segments. It can \nalso  be  used  to  encourage  qualified  financial  institutions  (QFIs)  to  improve  corporate \ngovernance or anti-money laundering (AML) standards beyond local requirements. \n \n2.  As part of ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen financial sectors and enhance its development \nimpact in its developing member countries (DMCs), ADB has approved three regional capacity \ndevelopment TA projects for private sector QFIs; phase 1 was completed in 2011 and phase 2 \nwill be completed at the end of 2014. The third TA targets transition countries in Central Asia \nand Mongolia.3 These TA projects have been used along with ADB funding or guarantees to \nprivate sector QFIs to enhance capacity development in a number of areas, including corporate \ngovernance and internal controls; financing strategies, including new product development; \nAML, anti-terrorism, and anticorruption efforts; risk management; and implementation of ADB \nenvironmental and social safeguards. Based on the successful utilization of the previous TAs \nand the continued need for financial sector capacity development, the proposed TA for South \nAsia (excluding India)4 will continue to support financial sector development in these DMCs and \nenhance ADB\u2019s development impact.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A  strong  financial  sector  is  necessary  to  facilitate  economic  growth  and  financial \ninclusion, which underpin poverty reduction.6 The development status of the financial sector \nvaries  throughout  ADB  DMCs.  Although  some  South  Asian  DMCs  are  classified  as  lower \nmiddle-income countries, the level of domestic credit provided by the banking sector is more \nakin to that in low-income countries, indicating that financial sector development is lagging \nbehind economic growth. Examples of key development needs in the financial sectors of two \nlarger South Asian DMCs follow.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

The country has a relatively large number of banks, given the size of its \neconomy; however according to International Finance Corporation estimates, 59% of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka lack a bank account.7  At the end of 2013, there \nwere 33 banks (composed of licensed commercial banks and licensed specialized banks), and \n58  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  operating  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  government  has \nintroduced  consolidation  plans  for  NBFIs  and  intends  to  create  larger  banks  through \nconsolidation.8 Compared  to  other  parts  of  South  Asia,  Sri  Lanka  has  a  sizable  nonbank \n \nfinancial sector; specialized financial institutions (e.g., pension, brokers), insurance, and other \ncontractual  savings  institutions  accounted  for  30.3%  of  total  assets  at  the  end  of  2013.9\n \nNonetheless,  Sri  Lanka's  insurance  industry  has  many  untapped  segments,  which  most \ninsurance  companies  have  not  taken  into  consideration  because  of  their  lack  of  product \ndevelopment and penetration. Less than 5% of households, shops, and individuals (for medical \ninsurance) are insured in Sri Lanka.10Microfinance is also underdeveloped, despite a large \n \nunregulated  market  in  microfinance,  with  numerous  active  microfinance  cooperatives  and \nnongovernment organizations. Sizable outreach into microfinance by state-owned banks has \nweakened the repayment culture and facilitated nonmarket-priced loans.11 The sector needs to \nbe consolidated, with improved risk management capabilities, new product development, and \nenhanced operational capacity via technology (e.g., mobile banking, tablets in microfinance and \ninsurance) that will improve efficiencies, and broaden customer outreach. \n \n5.  Bangladesh. The country has a banking sector comprised of four types of scheduled \nbanks. As of the end of 2013, four state-owned commercial banks held 26.7% of banking sector \nassets,  four  state-owned  development  financial  institutions  had  5.6%  of  the  market,  39 \ndomestically owned private commercial banks had 61.5% of total assets, while nine branches of \nforeign commercial banks held 6.2% of total assets.12 The banking sector continues to face \nchallenges. On average, state-owned banks have failed to match the performance of private \nand foreign commercial banks. The central bank remains focused on improving the governance \nand  oversight  of  the  banking  sector  by  strengthening  regulations,  especially  after  facing \nsignificant  fraud  cases  during  2011\u20132013.13 Bangladesh  also  had  about  700  microfinance \ninstitutions as of June 2013;14 three-fourths of the microfinance supply is provided by four large \nmicrofinance institutions.15 The microfinance industry has grown fairly consistently since the \n1990s, with much higher growth rates of 15%\u201328% during 2004\u20132007. Key growth areas for \nmicrofinance  institutions  and  NBFIs  are  insurance  and  leasing.  The  country\u2019s  insurance \npenetration is just 0.90%. About 8 million people were covered in 2008, but the market has the \n                                                \n7 International Finance Corporation. 2011. Sri Lanka Country Profile.

Examples such as \nGrameen Bank\u2019s lease-hire program could be expanded across other NBFIs.17 Much effort is \nneeded to improve operational and risk management processes across both the non-banking \nand commercial banking sectors in Bangladesh. \n \n6.  Access to finance remains a major obstacle to private sector development and poverty \nalleviation. In South Asia, only 33% (2011) of the population had access to the formal financial \nsector.18 As of the end of 2013, domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) equaled 48% in Bangladesh, 44% in Bhutan, 48% in the Maldives, and \n31% in Sri Lanka.19 These domestic credit ratios are considered low when compared to other \ncountries in Asia\u2014 the ratio is 118% in Malaysia, and 148% in Thailand.20  In many countries, \nbanking sector assets have grown more slowly than GDP.21 Moreover, access to credit for small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and other nontraditional sector borrowers are particularly \nlow versus larger, more established borrowers. SME loans make up just 25% of total bank \nlending across Asia and the Pacific and the use of credit guarantees has helped improve \nbankability in some countries.22 The non-bank sector represents an average 0.8% of financial \nsector assets to GDP in South Asia. There is a need to incorporate nonbank financing options \nand other schemes into national policies, such as increased use of asset-based finance and \ncapital market instruments.23 Small businesses lack access to credit from banks and NBFIs, with \njust 45% accessing lines of credit (footnote 21). Furthermore, the low level of GDP to insurance \npremiums paid in emerging Asian economies represents the lack of penetration of the insurance \nmarket, with insurance premiums equal to just 3% of GDP.24  \n \n7.  Strengthening  and  diversifying  the  financial  sectors  in  ADB  DMCs  via  knowledge \ntransfer and capacity building within banks and nonbanking QFIs is needed to develop more \ninnovative strategies and products tailored to a broader spectrum of borrowers. In addition, \ncorporate governance, AML, and anticorruption efforts need to be strengthened in many QFIs \nthroughout this region. Related party transactions, for instance, are prevalent in Asia and need \nto be carefully monitored.25 Risk management practices still do not meet international standards. \nWith the move to Basel III, and as financial systems in South Asia become larger, more complex, \nand more interconnected, many banks will be in need of capacity development to ensure that \nadequate risk management systems are in place. Good environmental and social management \nsystems and polices are also needed, and the introduction of such systems will typically require \nexternal expertise.  \n \n \n                                                \n16 World Bank. 2010.

ADB will identify and select the QFIs based on the following criteria.   \n(i)  The QFI should be a regulated financial institution (either private or public without \na government guarantee) and the target of an ADB nonsovereign investment.26 \n(ii)  The  QFI\u2019s  top  management  should  be  committed  to  implementing  business \ninnovations and strengthening its operations. \n(iii)  The QFI\u2019s management will put into place a project team to oversee the TA and \nagree to share up to 50% of the TA cost.27  \n(iv)  The QFI should have or be willing to put in place policies complying with ADB\u2019s \ngovernance standards, AML and anticorruption and anti-terrorism policies, and \nenvironmental and social safeguards. \n(v)  ADB must be satisfied with the integrity due diligence carried out on the QFI.   \n(vi)  The Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) must be providing financial \nsupport or plans to provide financial support to the QFIs receiving the TA. \n \n9.  Country selection. The TA will cover QFIs in all countries in South Asia (except India). \nAs  discussed, the financial  sector  in  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  DMCs  varies. The  assessment of \nfinancial sector needs will be based upon PSOD evaluations, country partnership strategies, \nprivate sector assessments, and third-party research.28   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be the enhanced capacity of selected QFIs with respect to (i) corporate \ngovernance,  \u201cknow-your-client\u201d  policies,  AML,  anti-terrorism  counter-terrorist  financing,  and \nanticorruption  efforts;  (ii)  financing  strategy,  including  product  development  with  respect  to \nonlending to, for example, microfinance borrowers, SMEs, housing, infrastructure, education, \nrenewable energy, insurance, and leasing; (iii) risk management; and (iv) environmental and \nsocial  safeguards  policies  and  practices.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  policies  and \nprocedures to ensure greater corporate governance and extended reach into microfinance, \nSMEs, housing, mobile banking, infrastructure, education, leasing and insurance markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  methodology  and  key  activities  of  the  TA  are  dependent  on  the  capacity \ndevelopment needs of the QFIs, as evaluated by PSOD during the due diligence for the ADB \nfunding or guarantees. As such, not all key activities noted below will be undertaken, given the \ntailored  nature  of  the  TA.  Likely  activities  include  (i)  improving  corporate  governance  and \ninternal  controls;  (ii)  strengthening  AML,  anti-terrorism,  and  anticorruption  policies;  (iii) \ndeveloping  and  strengthening  innovative  financing  strategies,  including  new  product \ndevelopment;  (iv)  improving  risk  management;  and  (v)  maintaining  or  introducing  an \nenvironmental and social management system. \n                                                \n26 Non-government-guaranteed financial sector institutions are public financial institutions that have no guarantees \nfrom the government or lender of last resort status. \n27 Smaller financial institutions with total assets of less than $75 million and new financial institutions with an \noperating history of 5 years or less may not be required to provide financial contributions to the TA. \n28 ADB. 2013.

A detailed \noutline can be viewed in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  The TA will also support regional seminars to share TA experiences and results, and \nreceive feedback for possible future interventions. Training programs will be held throughout the \nregion, and in other facilities as needed. The TA will fund the travel expenses of resource \npersons. Representatives from the QFIs and additional eligible participants will pay for their own \ntravel costs and related expenses.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $480,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by QFIs and administered by ADB. Details are provided in the cost \nestimates and financing plan (Appendix 2).29  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be executed and implemented by ADB, with the PSOD as the focal point. \nADB,  through  PSOD,  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical  implementation  issues. 30 \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented \nover 36 months from the start date, coinciding with the approval date of the TA. In accordance \nwith Article 14(iii) of the ADB Charter, any activity under the TA will begin only after receiving a \nno-objection letter from the government of the country in which the QFI is located.31 The TA \nactivities  will  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  international  and  national  consultants  and \nconsultancy firms (Appendix 3).32  ADB and each TA recipient will form a project planning and \ncoordination  committee  comprising  representatives  drawn  from  appropriate  levels  of  each \nfinancial institution and ADB.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by qualified financial institutions, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for Promoting Capacity Building in \nFinancial Institutions in Emerging Countries in South Asia, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.      \n                                                \n29 Part of the cost of implementing the TA will be borne by the selected financial institution. On an individual basis and \nas determined by PSOD, ADB may require the TA recipient to fund up to  50% of the TA costs with the exception of \nsmaller and new financial institutions. \n30 ADB may delegate parts of the TA to selected QFIs in compliance with ADB procedures and after consultation with \nADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department.  \n31 ADB. 1966.
