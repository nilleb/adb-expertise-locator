INTRODUCTION \n1  During the Country Programming Mission (10\u201312 December 2008) held in Manila, the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a new \u201cfacility-type\u201d technical assistance (TA) project for the \nperiod from 2009\u20132012. Beginning in 2004, ADB has provided several facility-type TA projects \nto provide flexible and timely knowledge products and services to the Government to respond \neffectively to emerging policies and capacity development needs.1 The first facility-type TA was \nrated  as  successful  and  its  outputs  were  used  in  formulating  emerging  policies  and \nstrengthening government capacity.2 ADB's responsiveness to government requests for policy \nadvice will be critical over the next few years, when the Government will (i) prepare the 12th \nFive-Year Plan (FYP) (2011\u20132015), (ii) formulate policy measures and reforms to mitigate the \nadverse  effects  of  the  economic slowdown,  and  (iii)  support  the  rebalancing of  its  growth \nstrategy. TA fact-finding took place in April and May 2009, and agreement was reached with the \nexecuting agency (EA)\u2014the Ministry of Finance (MOF)\u2014on the impact, outcome, scope, and \nimplementation arrangements. Inclusion of the TA in the 2009 pipeline was confirmed during the \nJune 2009 Country Program Midterm Review Mission. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2  Despite the considerable progress the PRC has made in terms of overall economic \ngrowth,  critical  gaps  and  imbalances  remain,  including  between  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, rural and urban areas, and western and coastal regions. The current global \neconomic crisis has further exacerbated these imbalances, which could pose an obstacle to \nachievement of social harmony. The key development constraints to be addressed include (i) \nlow productivity growth, particularly in rural areas and remote regions; (ii) inadequate provision \nof social services and social protection, particularly in rural areas, remote regions, and among \nthe poor and vulnerable groups; and (iii) weak institutions and capacity as well as constrained \nknowledge among responsible government agencies. Lessons from previous facility TA projects \nsuggest that effective project implementation arrangements require both (i) specific selection \ncriteria that serve to focus support on small-scale, short-term subprojects that complement long-\nterm, systematic efforts; and (ii) coordination and cooperation among the EA, implementing \nagencies (IAs), and ADB.  \n \n3  The  Government  continues  to  have  a  critical  need  for assistance relating  to policy \nrecommendations and capacity building, to enable it to quickly and effectively formulate and \nexecute policies to mitigate adverse impacts on its citizens\u2014and vulnerable groups in particular \n\u2014during the economic slowdown. The implementation period of the proposed TA will coincide \nwith the period during which the Government formulates the policy directions for the 12th FYP. \nThe proposed TA will strengthen the strategic partnership and cooperation between the PRC \nand  ADB  on  the  country's  development  agenda,  based  on  the  PRC\u2019s  needs  and  ADB's \nstrengths. Cooperation under the proposed TA will contribute to achieving the goals of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The proposed TA aims to equip the Government with policy inputs, tools, and a \nforum to respond quickly and effectively to new and emerging development challenges. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA will be effective policy and strategy formulation and enhanced \ncapacity of relevant government agencies based on the PRC's FYP framework. The outcome is \nthe adoption by relevant government agencies of policy reforms, regulations, and new ideas and \npractices  that  are  introduced  or  recommended  under  the  TA,  based  on  the  PRC's  FYP \nframework. The impact and outcome are expected to be realized through frequent dialogue and \nclose cooperation between ADB and the EA, IAs, and key stakeholders.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The key outputs of the TA will be (i) at least 10 studies (one for each policy-related \nsubproject) assessing and providing concrete recommendations for priority policy issues; (ii) at \nleast three activity reports (one for each capacity-building subproject) (a) outlining the key \nrationale, gaps addressed, processes, and outcomes; and (b), attaching a resource material kit \nto support replication of similar and/or follow-up capacity-building activities; and (iii) bilingual \nsynopses (one for each subproject) distilling (a) the key issues (e.g., gaps in policy, operational \nmechanisms, and implementation capacities) and (b) recommendations (e.g., proposed reforms \nand/or operational mechanisms to support more effective policy, or lessons from capacity-\nbuilding approaches and recommendations for future programs).  \n \n7.  The TA will allow ADB to provide timely support for PRC reform processes and capacity \nbuilding, and its design provides a flexible framework, including allowing selection of some \nsubprojects during TA implementation. Subprojects will be selected jointly by the Government \nand  ADB  to  provide  timely  support  to  emerging  government  reform  and  capacity-building \npriorities, in areas (i) where ADB\u2019s involvement is expected to have substantial impact on \ndevelopment, refinement, and/or operationalization of national policy; and (ii) that are consistent \nwith ADB's PRC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008\u201320106 and its updates, and \ncomplementary  to  ADB  lending  and  TA  operations.  Policy-related  activities  may  include \nformulation and/or amendment of policies, laws, and regulations; and design or refinement of \ninstitutional  structures,  operational  procedures,  and  capacity-building  mechanisms.  This \nflexibility will enable the EA and ADB to both address new emerging development issues and \nsupplement other ADB operations (nonlending and lending products) in a timely manner. The \nTA  also  allows  for  interventions  in  various  sectors  in  addressing  the  PRC's  evolving  key \ndevelopment constraints. ADB can respond to and address the Government's emerging needs \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008.

The  criteria  for  prioritizing  policy-related  subprojects  include  that  the  subproject:  (i) \nsupports priority government policy reforms and is consistent with the CPS for 2008\u20132010;7 (ii) \nis related to preparation of the 12th FYP, particularly in the areas that address key development \nconstraints (para. 2, above); (iii) is considered an emerging, urgent, and high-priority issue \nwhere ADB has considerable potential to provide value addition; and (iv) shows evidence of \nstrong PRC ownership, such that a small amount of strategic ADB assistance will help advance \nor realize important reforms and/or leverage the outcome and impact of existing projects. The \ncriteria seek to strengthen the development impact resulting from achievement by the PRC of \nthe  strategic  goal  of  building  a  harmonious  and  moderately  prosperous  society  through  a \ncombination  of  sustainable  economic  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  capacity \ndevelopment. Priority will be given to capacity-building subprojects that support cooperation \nbetween the PRC and ADB in addressing the key development constraints highlighted in para. 2.  \n \n9.  Activities  will  be  divided  into  two  categories\u2014policy  advice  and  capacity  building\u2014\noverseen by the EA, in close consultation and coordination with the IAs, ADB, and relevant \nstakeholders.  \n \n10.  Policy Advice. The TA subprojects will allow selected central and provincial government \nagencies to be provided with policy advice on priority development issues in different sectors \nand subjects including (i) the preparation of the 12th FYP, (ii) social sector reform (especially \nwith  respect  to  health and  education),  and  (iii)  other  priority  sectors  agreed  jointly  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. Activities will include research studies, policy dialogue and stakeholder \nconsultation through meetings, workshops, and conferences. The indicative allotment for this \noutput category is $900,000. The following seven subprojects, with a total budget of $450,000, \nhave been indicatively identified for initial funding as outlined in Appendix 2. \n \n(i)  Assessment of Application of the Labor Contract Law to Informal Sector \nEmployment ($50,000); \n(ii)  Internal Audit Roles and Best Practices ($100,000); \n(iii)  Quality Supervision and Control of Health Reform Projects ($50,000); \n(iv)  Water-Environment Modeling and Quality Monitoring in Yuqiao Reservoir of \nTianjin ($100,000); \n(v)  Application  of  International  Best  Practices  of  Social  Welfare  Reforms  to \nSocial Assistance Policy in the PRC ($50,000); \n(vi)  Fiscal  Policy  for  Rural  Environmental  Protection  in  Liaoning  Province \n($50,000); and \n(vii)  Evaluation of Models for Urban Medical and Health Institutions to Support \nTownship Hospitals in Hebei Province ($50,000).  \n11.  Capacity Building. The TA subprojects will allow the development and management \ncapacity of selected central and provincial government agencies to be strengthened through \norganizational diagnostics, capacity assessments, training program implementation, workshops, \nconferences, and knowledge management interventions. The indicative allotment for this output \ncategory is $300,000, and three subprojects have been identified for initial funding, for the \n                                                 \n7  In addition to the CPS priorities, the broad themes of knowledge products and services agreed between ADB and \nthe  Government  include  macroeconomic  management,  energy  and  environment,  poverty  reduction,  and \ninterprovincial cooperation. \n ", "4   \ndissemination  of  ADB  TA  best  practices  in  selected  themes  or  sectors  though  annual \nconferences (in 2009, 2010, and 2011) on experience sharing. The total cost estimate for \nactivities related to the three conferences is $150,000, with an estimated budget of $50,000 for \neach conference. \n \n12.  Additional subprojects (beyond those initially identified) are expected to be included \nunder the proposed TA throughout the 3-year implementation period, using the selection criteria \nspecified in para. 8. ADB and the EA will hold four meetings per year to update the list of \nsubprojects  and  core  outputs;  subsequent  to  each  meeting,  the  two  parties  will  record \nagreements reached during the meeting, attaching (i) an updated subproject list with detailed \nproject designs and specific terms of reference for additional subprojects, and (ii) reports on \nimplementation progress for all TA subprojects. The country director of ADB\u2019s PRC Resident \nMission (PRCM) will review and endorse the agreements between ADB and the EA.  \n \n13.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  select  the  additional  subprojects,  with  each \ncomponent indicatively including a final subproject to produce a concise synthesis monograph in \nboth print and electronic format to systematically compile and support dissemination of key \nachievements, lessons, and policy implications. Subprojects will typically include conferences to \ndiscuss and build consensus on key issues, capacity-building seminars, and/or other workshops \ninvolving participants from government agencies, the private sector, NGOs, and/or international \nagencies.  These  workshops,  along  with  distribution  of  key  subproject  outputs  (para.  6)  in \nhardcopy and via the internet, will serve to disseminate information and subproject findings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,620,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$1,200,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nothers).  The  Government  will  contribute  $420,000  equivalent  in-kind  for  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and miscellaneous services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. Estimated budgets for indicative initial subprojects are noted above (paras. 10\u201311). \nSubsequent subprojects will be subject to a maximum of $100,000 unless this ceiling is waived \nby the EA and ADB; the latter may also agree to adjust subproject budgets where justified in \nspecial cases and acceptable to the IA. \n \n15.  The cost estimate is based on engaging expert inputs equivalent to a total of 14 person-\nmonths of international expert inputs and 70 person-months of national expert inputs (see \noutline terms of reference for consultants in Appendix 4). At least 20 individual consultants, of \nwhich at least three are international consultants, will be recruited to take up tasks under the ten \ninitial subprojects. Detailed outline terms of reference for the individual consultants will be \ndeveloped  in  close  consultation  with  the  EA,  IAs,  relevant  sector  experts  from  ADB,  and \nresponsible ADB staff from Central Operations Service Office. TA support for workshops may \ninclude costs related to the venue, equipment rental, translation, printing and copying, food and \nnon-alcoholic beverages, transportation, lodging, logistics and administrative support, and other \nagreed expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. Subprojects may also fund surveys, field \ninvestigations,  and  the  purchase  of  required  resource  materials,  based  on  cost  estimates \nagreed by ADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support IA management \nfees, overhead, or related costs such as staff salaries and allowances and the use of IA \nresources (such as office accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart \ncontribution. \n ", "                          5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented from September 2009 to August 2012. MOF will be the EA, \nwith  responsibility  for  oversight  and  coordination  of  subproject  activities.  To  ensure  strong \ncoordination, ADB and the EA will meet quarterly or as needed to review progress and discuss \nadditional subproject candidates.  \n \n17.  Throughout the 3-year implementation period, ADB and the EA will continuously accept \nsubproject proposals from government organizations, various institutions, NGOs, and, in special \ncases, a unit within the EA or ADB. Based on the proposed TA design and selection criteria, \nADB  and  the  EA  will  jointly  agree  on  subprojects  to  be  included  in  the  TA,  and  on  the \nresponsible IAs. The PRCM will conduct internal consultations and discussions with relevant \nADB experts in EARD and other knowledge departments to assess the urgency of subproject \nproposals, and their complementary quality to ongoing and planned ADB operations in the PRC. \nFor each agreed subproject, the IA will assume responsibility for ensuring coordination and the \nquality and timeliness of output delivery. It will identify one focal point to provide working-level \ninputs throughout the subproject, including (i) liaising with the EA, ADB, and additional key \nactors  and  decision-makers  to  support  implementation  and  policy  dialogue;  (ii)  identifying, \nproposing to ADB and the EA, and coordinating with the external subproject experts needed for \nactivities, specific written inputs, and a review of key draft reports; and (iii) based on discussions \nwith the experts, proposing to the EA and ADB any needed changes in subproject scope or \napproaches.  \n \n18.  ADB staff will monitor, and in some cases directly contribute to, TA progress and outputs, \nand  will  conduct  policy  discussions  with  relevant  Government  agencies.  ADB\u2019s PRCM  will \nadminister the TA, with counterparts from ADB Headquarters providing contributions to and/or \nmanagement of some subprojects, based on their technical strengths and complementarity to \nother ADB programs. \n \n19.  In dialogue with the EA and/or relevant IA, ADB will recruit consultants as individual \nconsultants,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  recruit  national  (70  person-months  equivalent)  and \ninternational (14 person-months equivalent) experts to provide inputs as formal consultants, \nshort-term resource persons, and task-specific experts. The terms of reference, including the \nduration and expected results, will be endorsed by ADB. Additional resource persons and task-\nspecific experts will carry out specific tasks (e.g., case-study papers, workshop presentations, \nreview of draft reports, etc.). All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.8 To facilitate \nimplementation, ADB may establish an advance facility for the EA and IAs as needed, and/or \nutilize direct payment (e.g., for workshop venues).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Facility  for  the  Policy  Reform  and \nCapacity Building III, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2008.
