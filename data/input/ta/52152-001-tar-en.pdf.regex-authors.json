In  pursuit  of  its  goal  to  achieve  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic  growth,  the \nGovernment of Indonesia (the government) has initiated an ambitious infrastructure development \nagenda designed to boost productivity and provide access to economic opportunities and basic \npublic services across the archipelago. To support this agenda, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has prioritized meeting the government\u2019s infrastructure development goals in its country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Indonesia.1 The Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program \nPhase II (SIAP2) will support effective identification, preparation, implementation, and financing \nof infrastructure projects, building on the successes and lessons learned from SIAP Phase I \n(SIAP1).2 The Government of Australia (GoA) has agreed to finance SIAP2 on a grant basis.  \nA.  Analysis of Key Issues \n \n2.  Infrastructure gap has impeded economic growth.3 The infrastructure gap is due to a \nlong period of underinvestment: overall infrastructure spending in Indonesia dropped from 8% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) during 1995\u20131997 to about 4% of GDP during 2008\u20132014. In 2017, \nannual infrastructure expenditure of approximately $30 billion was dwarfed by annual investment \nneeds of more than $70 billion before adjusting for climate change. The adverse impact of \nunderinvestment in infrastructure manifests itself across sectors. Logistics costs are among the \nhighest in Southeast Asia, at 25% of total GDP, and infrastructure is consistently identified as one \nof the most serious obstacles to expanding connectivity, private investment, and job creation. \nEnergy supply is costly, unreliable, and inaccessible for many, especially outside the economic \ngrowth centers. Access to basic urban water and sanitation services is poor, with 20% of the \npopulation lacking access to improved water sources and 40% with no access to improved \nsanitation facilities. Only 4% of septage and 1% of urban wastewater are treated. Only 55% of \nIndonesia\u2019s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity, reducing yields and cropping intensity. \nPoor flood control is a major factor contributing to economic losses of $2.3 billion annually. \n \n3.  The public sector played a critical role in ramping up infrastructure investments. 4  \nUnder the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019 (RPJMN),5 the government \nplans to deliver approximately $415 billion worth of infrastructure projects, with central and local \ngovernments, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and private sector financing accounting for 41%, \n22%,  and  37%  of  such  investments,  respectively.  While  central  and  local  government \ninfrastructure spending rose from 1.7% of GDP in 2014 to 3.3% in 2017, it is likely to be \nconstrained by an annual 3% fiscal deficit target. Through government equity injections equaling \n0.6% of GDP in 2015\u20132016, and the incurrence of additional debt amounting in aggregate to 33% \nof GDP in 2016, SOEs have supported significant infrastructure investments. However, SOEs \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Indonesia 2016\u20132019: Towards a Higher, More Inclusive and Sustainable Growth Path. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2013.

Private sector participation in infrastructure projects has been limited. During 2014\u2013\n2017, the government further improved the legal and institutional frameworks for public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPP).6 However, PPPs have had a limited impact in recent years, with private sector \ninvestment accounting for only 9% of total investment in infrastructure during the period 2011\u2013\n2015.7 As of March 2018, PPP projects with an aggregate cost of $7.8 billion were under \nconstruction, while PPP projects valued at $4.2 billion were being tendered.8 \n \n5.  Planning,  project  preparation,  and  implementation  remain  critical  challenges.9 \nInadequate spatial, land use, and sector planning makes it difficult to identify, prioritize, and \nsequence infrastructure investments. Project preparation efforts suffer from delays and quality \nproblems due to poor quality feasibility studies, inappropriate design standards, deficient detailed \nengineering designs, and weak procurement capacity. Direct assignment to SOEs of projects with \nhigh potential for commercial viability dampens private sector interest in PPPs.  \n \n6.  Project implementation performance has been mixed and remains a constraint to the \neffective delivery of public infrastructure due to: (i) substandard construction quality and safety \nregimen; (ii) weak asset monitoring and management; (iii) reluctance of top-tier consulting firms \nand contractors to bid on public sector projects, partly due to inadequate budgets and delayed \npayments;  (iv)  contracting  approaches  that  limit  commitments  to  annual  budgets;  and  (v) \ninadequate  resourcing  of  implementation  supervision.  Planning,  project  preparation,  and \nimplementation  challenges  are  compounded  by  weak  inter-ministerial  and  inter-agency \ncoordination and inconsistencies in the policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks.   \n \n7.  Sources  of  long-term  infrastructure  financing  are  limited. 10  Raising  long-term \nfinancing for infrastructure projects remains challenging, in part because Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsector is relatively underdeveloped by regional standards, with financial sector assets equaling \n72%  of  GDP.  More  than  75%  of  financial  sector  assets  are  owned  by  banks,  which  are \nincreasingly constrained in their ability to provide loans with long (greater than 10 years) tenors \ndue to Basel III norms, asset-liability mismatch issues, and regulatory lending limits applicable to \nborrowers and borrower groups. Even though Indonesia has relatively shallow equity and debt \n                                                \n6   Improvements included: (i) adoption of the new PPP framework under Presidential Regulation No. 38/2015 on PPP \nfor Infrastructure Projects; (ii) introduction of government support mechanisms for PPPs, such as the viability gap \nfunding, project development fund, and availability payment model; and (iii) operationalization of PT Sarana Multi \nInfrastruktur (SMI), PT Indonesia Infrastructure Finance (IIF), and PT Penjaminan Infrastruktur Indonesia (IIGF), \nwhich have become important players in catalyzing bank and capital market debt financing for PPPs. SMI and IIGF \nare SOEs under the Ministry of Finance providing advisory services as well as infrastructure financing and guarantee \nsupport, respectively. IIF is a private non-bank financial company with shareholding from SMI, ADB, and other \nfinancial institutions, providing infrastructure financing and advisory services. \n7  World Bank. 2017.

SIAP2 will enable ADB to strengthen support for infrastructure development. Under \nits  CPS  and  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)  for  Indonesia,11 ADB  significantly \nexpanded its operations in infrastructure sectors to closely align with the RPJMN.12 In close \ncoordination with key development partners, SIAP2 will support the priorities of the current \nRPJMN as well as the next RPJMN (2020\u20132024) and priorities specified in GoA\u2019s Foreign Policy \nWhite Paper and Aid Investment Plan for Indonesia.13 The design of SIAP2 incorporates lessons \nlearned14 from SIAP1, which directly and indirectly contributed to about $5 billion of new ADB \nlending in the energy, urban services, water and sanitation, and rural infrastructure sectors. \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality  \n \n9.  SIAP2 is proposed as a transaction technical assistance (TRTA) cluster that will provide: \n(i) project preparation support to specific ensuing infrastructure projects listed in ADB\u2019s current \nand future COBPs for Indonesia; and (ii) implementation and capacity-building support to specific \nongoing ADB-funded infrastructure projects. Such activities will account for approximately two-\nthirds of the TRTA cluster costs. The cluster modality will allow subprojects to be flexibly \nprocessed as needed to provide required project preparation and implementation support. Given \nthe long implementation period, it is not possible to list all the specific projects to be supported \nthrough the TRTA cluster. This proposal presents subprojects to be approved in 2018\u20132019,15 \nwhile future additional subprojects will be proposed for approval in line with the annually updated \nCOBPs.  \n \n10.  A single knowledge and support technical assistance (KSTA) subproject will also be \nincluded in the TRTA cluster with its own corresponding design and monitoring framework. \nKnowledge and policy advisory activities will be closely linked to ADB\u2019s lending operations and \nwill account for approximately one-third of the TRTA cluster costs.16 \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2016.

Outcome and Outputs \n \n11.   Overall outcome. The TRTA cluster will have the following overall outcome: effective \nidentification,  preparation,  implementation,  and  financing  of  infrastructure  projects.  Each \nsubproject will generally deliver all or some of the following outputs, to be further elaborated under \neach TA subproject proposal. \n \n12.  Output 1: Infrastructure projects identified and prepared. This output will support \npreparation of infrastructure projects across the energy, transport, urban services, and water \nresources  sectors,  leveraging  ADB  infrastructure-related  project  financing  and  cofinancing, \nestimated at approximately $11 billion from 2018 to 2024.17 In the energy sector, the project \npreparatory activities will expand connectivity through clean and renewable energy generation, \nincluding geothermal power, natural gas infrastructure to replace diesel as an electric generation \nfuel; electric transmission and distribution; and carbon capture and storage. In the transport sector, \nconnectivity will be strengthened through railway and road network development as well as urban \ntransport. In urban infrastructure subsectors, the focus will be on water supply, sewerage and \nsanitation; flood control and drainage; and the improvement of services in informal settlements. \nIn the water resources sector, the focus will be on improving raw water supply; increasing \nresilience to climate change through flood-risk management; and developing water-efficient \nirrigation systems in response to the growing demand for food and competing needs for water \namong sectors. Projects in other infrastructure sectors may be supported by agreement of the \ngovernments of Indonesia and Australia and ADB. \n \n13.  Output 2: Enhanced project implementation support. This output will directly support \nefficient and effective implementation of ADB-financed projects in the energy, transport, urban \nservices, and water resources sectors. Areas of support will be strengthening procurement, \nquality of implementation supervision, and monitoring of social and environmental safeguards. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Knowledge  support  for  infrastructure  planning  and  financing  and \neffective program management. This output will be delivered through a single KSTA subproject \nwith three components. The first component will involve knowledge, capacity building, and policy \nadvisory support around innovative infrastructure-financing approaches, including PPPs, green \nfinance facilities, and capital market vehicles, such as asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, \nproject  bonds,  sukuk  bonds,  and  infrastructure  funds.  In  particular,  the  KSTA  will  identify \nmechanisms through which infrastructure and non-bank financial SOEs can utilize innovative \nfinancing approaches to catalyze private capital. The second component will involve knowledge, \ncapacity  building,  and  policy  advisory  support  around  infrastructure  planning.  Relevant \ninfrastructure-related ministries, agencies, and SOEs for each subproject will be beneficiaries of \nknowledge, capacity building, and policy advisory support. The third component will support \nSIAP2 program management to ensure that value for money considerations drive both the design \nand implementation of all subprojects.  \n \n15.  Operational priorities. SIAP2 is fully aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 203018, specifically: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) \naccelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; (v) \npromoting rural development and food security; (vi) strengthening governance and institutional \n                                                \n17   Sectoral priorities were endorsed by the SIAP1 Steering Committee in September 2018.   \n18  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "5 \ncapacity; and (vii) fostering regional cooperation and integration. Moreover, SIAP2 will help \nexpand private sector participation in public infrastructure by preparing bankable projects and \nscaling up support for PPPs. \n \n16.  In support of these operational priorities, SIAP 2 will focus on (i) innovation and new \ntechnologies in project design and implementation that can enhance connectivity and linkages \nbetween  and  among  public  and  private  sector  players;  (ii)  private  sector  development  by \npromoting private sector participation in infrastructure, including PPPs and advocating investment \nclimate reform as it refers to infrastructure; (iii) innovative infrastructure financing to catalyze \nprivate sector participation; (iv) sound public sector management by supporting robust upstream \nplanning,  project  preparation,  public  procurement,  and  financial  management  practices;  (v) \nclimate  resilience  by  supporting  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures  in  target \ninfrastructure sectors; (vi) gender equity by mainstreaming gender, especially in project design \nbased on gender and social assessments for ADB\u2019s infrastructure projects in Indonesia, where \nrelevant; and (vii) partnerships by promoting and building on partnerships with and among other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  development  financing  institutions  (including  infrastructure-related \nprograms supported by the GoA), private sector infrastructure investors and advisors, and \ncommercial  banks.  SIAP2  may  also  focus  on  additional  themes  as  agreed  among  the \ngovernments of Indonesia and Australia and ADB. \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n17.  SIAP2 is estimated to cost $30 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the GoA \nand administered by ADB.19 If infrastructure project preparation support results in nonsovereign \nfinancing by ADB or any other institution, the sponsor shall be required to reimburse the costs of \nsuch assistance. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each \nTA subproject proposal submitted for approval. Cofinancing of a TA subproject will be allowed \nwhere additional resources would enhance the implementation of such subproject. ADB will \nmanage the funds in accordance with its procedures. Funds will be returned to the TRTA cluster \nfor allocation to other subprojects in the event of: (i) savings at the closing of individual subprojects; \nor (ii) cost recovery from sponsors in case project preparation support results in successful \nnonsovereign financing. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA subprojects \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Counterpart support for TA subprojects \nfrom implementing agencies will be provided in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and domestic transportation. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. BAPPENAS will be the executing agency, while \nrelevant  infrastructure-related  ministries,  agencies,  and  SOEs  will  serve  as  implementing \nagencies.  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Institutional Arrangements. Given the size and complexity of SIAP2, ADB will \nestablish a Program Management Unit (PMU) under the supervision of ADB\u2019s TA officer, who will \nbe responsible for program management, financial management, fiduciary oversight, monitoring, \nevaluation, reporting, and communications. SERD will coordinate closely with PSOD on TRTAs \n                                                \n19  The amount includes ADB's administration fee, audit costs, bank charges, and provisions for foreign exchange \nfluctuations (if any), to the extent these items are not covered by the interest and investment income earned on this \ngrant, or any additional grant contributions by the GoA. Any interest, investment income, and gains from foreign \nexchange transactions generated from the grant will be used for the purpose of the TA or to partially or fully cover \nADB's administration fee. \n ", "6 \ninvolving the preparation of subprojects that involve nonsovereign entities. Each TA subproject \nwill be endorsed by the governments of Australia and Indonesia before the proposal is submitted \nfor approval to the Director General, SERD, in accordance with the business process for TRTA \ncluster processing. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for SIAP2 \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  December 2018\u2013June 2024 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  BAPPENAS \nImplementing agency  Relevant infrastructure-related ministries, agencies, and SOEs \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADBa \n  Selection method: to be  International expertise  $17 million \ndetermined  (900 person-months) \nSelection method: to be  National expertise  $8 million \ndetermined  (2,100 person-months) \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB b \n  Shopping for office  Multiple contracts   $100,000 \nsupplies, furniture, and IT \nequipment \n  Office space rental c  1 contract  $120,000 per year \nAdvance contracting and  To be determined. \nretroactive financing \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Fixed assets will be turned over to the government upon completion of \narrangement   SIAP2 or be disposed as ADB assets. \na   Inputs and cost estimates will be finalized during the preparation of each subproject. \nb   Cost estimates will be finalized during the preparation of the KSTA subproject.

Strategy Setting and Monitoring. A steering committee will endorse all TA subprojects \nand provide strategic and tactical guidance on programming and critical project-related activities \nof SIAP2. It will comprise three co-chairs, including the Deputy Minister for Infrastructure of \nBAPPENAS,  the  Minister  Counsellor  for  Infrastructure  and  Economic  Governance  of  the \nAustralian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the ADB Country Director. The steering \ncommittee will be guided by the infrastructure development priorities of the governments of \nAustralia and Indonesia, and operationally focus on leveraging ADB\u2019s CPS and COBP. A strategic \ndirections  meeting  will  be  held  on  an  annual basis,  to review  TRTA cluster  progress  and \naccomplishments from the previous year, discuss the broad set of deliverables under each output \nfor the year ahead, and allocate annual funding limits to each subproject. Six-monthly review \nmeetings will monitor ongoing progress and discuss issues and opportunities. Ad-hoc meetings \nwill be held to discuss emerging issues and opportunities as they arise, including approvals of \nproposed  new  subprojects.  SIAP2  will  include  formal  inception, mid-term,  and final review \nmeetings. A monitoring and evaluation strategy will be prepared to ensure compliance with GoA\u2019s \n ", "7 \nPerformance  Assessment  Framework20 that  includes  indicators  for  additional  financing  co-\ninvested in development and number of improvements to development policy. \n \n21.  Safeguards and Gender. Infrastructure projects prepared and implemented using SIAP2 \nresources will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement (2009), Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment (2003), Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Operational Plan 2013\u20132020 \n(2013), and Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012), as may be \namended from time to time. \n \n22.   Procurement. Procurement of goods and recruitment of consultants will be undertaken in \naccordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \napplicable project administration instructions and staff instructions. Under each TA subproject, (i) \nADB may enter into consulting contracts based on the total approved subproject amount even if \nonly a portion of such amount is available at the time of subproject approval, and (ii) to the extent \nADB  enters  into  multiyear  consulting  contracts,  the  PMU  will  ensure  that  such  subproject \nmaintains adequate financial resources to meet all contractual payment obligations.  \n \n23.
