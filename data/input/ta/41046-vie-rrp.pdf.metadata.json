Environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  adverse environmental impacts identified. \n   \nProgram Description  The  program  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Program  outlined  under  the  development  partner-\nfunded Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 6), as part \nof the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 of \nthe  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the  Government).  The  SEDP \nprovides a medium-term framework for this 5-year cycle of PRSC \noperations that comprises poverty reduction policies, programs, \nand actions with specific targets for development outcomes by \n2010.  \n   \nRationale  The  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  community  in  Viet \nNam  considers  the  PRSC  to  be  an  important  instrument  for \nsupporting  SEDP  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument \ncovering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the PRSC \nframework provides the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with an \nopportunity to (i) advance and widen the national policy dialogue \nin  a  well-coordinated  and  comprehensive  manner,  (ii)  provide \nlending and nonlending assistance in coordination with other ODA \npartners, and (iii) ensure that key policy issues affecting ADB \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  are  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ODA  community  to  help \nachieve the common goal of poverty reduction and growth.  \n   \n  In addition to ADB, the World Bank and other major ODA partners \nintend to contribute both financial and intellectual resources to \nPRSC 6. ODA partners include Australia, Canada, Denmark, the \nEuropean  Commission,  Germany,  Ireland,  Japan,  the \nNetherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Switzerland, while \nnot a financing partner, provided financial support for coordinating \nthe process. The International Monetary Fund, France, and the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  participated  in  the \nPRSC policy dialogue.  \n   \n ", "ii \n  The current cycle of PRSCs is a vehicle for the donor community \nto stay engaged with Viet Nam, and has delivered outstanding \nperformance in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction in \nthe previous cycle. The PRSC is the only instrument that allows \ndonors to actively engage in supporting a comprehensive, cross-\ncutting  reform  agenda  in  Viet  Nam.  The  coherence  of  the \ncomprehensive reform program under the PRSCs, particularly the \nfundamental governance reforms, helps ensure the effectiveness \nof sectoral interventions by ADB and other donors. Both economic \ngrowth and changes in the social environment have occurred at a \nrapid pace in recent years, and active and frequent engagement \nthrough PRSCs should help improve the content of specific policy \nactions, ensure their timely adoption, and assist in monitoring the \nimpact of the overall program on broader development outcomes.   \n   \n  ADB has been actively involved in formulating PRSC 6, and has \npromoted policy dialogue on similar issues through its program \nlending activities and sector policy reforms. PRSC 6 complements \nADB\u2019s support of Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms.  \n   \n  The  proposed  loan  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  recent  efforts  to  adopt \nprogram-based and sector approaches in its lending operations, \nso as to reduce transaction costs, both for developing member \ncountries and its own operations. The approach is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  long-term  strategic  framework,  and \nmedium-term strategies I and II, and will directly help fulfill ADB\u2019s \nobligations to the Rome Declaration on harmonizing procedures of \nmultilateral development banks (2003) and the Paris Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness (2005). \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the proposed loan is to reduce poverty \nand sustain high economic growth in Viet Nam. The proposed \nloan  will  help  fund  PRSC  6  and  thereby  (i)  reduce  structural \nweaknesses and improve the business environment, (ii) promote \nsocial inclusion, (iii) protect natural resources, and (iv) modernize \ngovernance. \n   \nCost Estimates  Some  of  the  reforms  supported  by  the  PRSC  process  entail \nsubstantial costs to be financed by the state. Policy measures \nsupported by the PRSC operations require additional spending.  \n   \n  The estimated cost of some specific PRSC-related measures for \nthe  PRSC  6  implementation  period  is  approximately  $1,420 \nmillion, i.e., (i) health care funds for the poor\u2014about $90 million, \n(ii)  increased  spending  on  education  proportional  to  the \nGovernment  budget\u2014about  $540  million,  (iii)  social  safety  net \nprogram  for  the  retrenched  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE) \nworkers\u2014about  $100  million,  and  (iv)  state-owned  commercial \nbank (SOCB) recapitalization\u2014about $690 million.  \n   ", "         iii \nFinancing Plan  A total of about $354 million for PRSC 6 operations is expected to \nbe funded through ODA resources. The World Bank has already \napproved a $175 million credit from the International Development \nAssociation  to  support  PRSC  6.  Financing  partners  providing \nparallel concessional loans include ADB ($15 million), the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (\u00a53.5 billion), and Germany (\u20ac6 \nmillion).  Financing  partners  providing  grants  include  Agencia \nEspa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional (\u20ac5 million), Australian \nAgency for International Development (A$10 million), Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Can$7.5  million),  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (DKr61  million),  European \nCommission  (\u20ac20  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac7.5  million),  Netherlands \nMinistry of Development Cooperation (\u20ac12 million), and United \nKingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  (\u20a420 \nmillion). Swiss Development Cooperation, while not a financing \npartner of PRSC 6, provided financial support for coordination of \nthe process. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan equivalent to $15 million in special drawing rights from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will be provided. The loan will \nhave  a  24-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an \ninterest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the \namortization period, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds may be used to \nfinance eligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date \nof  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  reflects  ADB\u2019s  support  for \nimplementation of the SEDP following the policy framework of the \nPRSC 6 program. The loan will contribute to financing adjustment \ncosts resulting from implementation of the policy matrix and will \nsupport and facilitate the Government\u2019s continued and deepened \nreform program for poverty reduction. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2008. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency. \nSBV works in close collaboration with the World Bank to prepare \nand implement the PRSCs. \n   \n ", "iv \nImplementation  The Steering Committee was established in June 2007 to advise \nArrangements  the  Prime  Minister  in  developing  and  implementing  the \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and \nPoverty  Reduction  Support  Credits  in  consistence  with  the \npurposes of the Scioeconomic Development Plan  2006\u20132010., \nSuch committee is chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge \nof  economic  reforms,  and  consists  of  representatives  from \nrelevant line ministries and government agencies. An SBV deputy \ngovernor  and  a  vice  minister  of  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment act as the standing vice chairpersons. To represent \nPRSC policy reform areas, the steering committee has several \nrepresentatives from key economic ministries (e.g., the ministries \nof  agriculture  and  rural  development;  education  and  training; \nfinance;  foreign  affairs;  justice;  industry  and  trade;  and  labor, \ninvalids,  and social  affairs;  and),  as well  as  the  Office  of  the \nGovernment. \n   \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program \nloan will be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.  \n   \n  No supporting import documentation will be required, provided the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nofficial development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed. The Government \nwill  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's \ncertification.  As  such,  the  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, are felt \nto be satisfactory. \n   ", "         v \nProject Benefits and  The proposed loan will benefit the Vietnamese people in four \nBeneficiaries  ways. First, through policy actions designed to facilitate business \ndevelopment,  the  loan  will  increase  efficiency,  accelerate \neconomic growth, and create jobs. These policy actions will help \nimprove the regulatory framework for private sector development, \nand enhance transparency and accountability in SOE operations \nand in banking. Second, policy actions addressing social inclusion \nwill result in benefits that include improved quality of education, \nimproved access of the poor to health services, a reformed social \nprotection  system,  and  promotion  of  gender  equality.  Third, \nthrough policy actions addressing natural resources, the loan will \nhelp secure land ownership and address the resettlement and \ncompensation process, as well as promoting more sustainable \nmanagement of natural resources. Fourth, through policy actions \naddressing  modern  governance,  benefits  include  increased \ntransparency and accountability of public finances, and improved \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  will  be  achieved \nthrough better coordination of plans and budgets, adoption of the \nmedium-term expenditure framework, and greater accountability \nin public finance and public administration.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are three potential risks associated with imbalances that \nmay emerge as Viet Nam achieves greater global integration and \nmarket-orientation.  \n   \n  The first potential risk is the vulnerability that stems from possible \nturbulence in the financial sector. The supervisory and regulatory \ncapacity  of  monetary  authorities  has  not  kept  pace  with  the \nexpansion  of  capital  markets.  The  second  risk  relates  to  the \nmassive  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  and  increased \ncompetition in formerly protected sectors. This change may test \nthe ability of Viet Nam to preserve social inclusion, and may cause \nsome groups to lose in the short term. The third possible risk \ninvolves  potential  corruption  and  social  strife  related  to  rapid \nurbanization and infrastructure development.  \n   \n  The Government is aware of the potential risks, and will mitigate \nthese by considering and implementing appropriate measures and \nproactive programs during program implementation.  \n   \n  ADB, along with other PRSC financing partners, has conducted \nanalytical  studies  to  help  policymakers  formulate  and  execute \nmitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these \npotential  risks.  These  corrective  measures  have  been \nincorporated in the series of PRSCs, which include this program \nloan. \n \n ", "", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction Program IV (SIPRP IV). The program loan follows a program-based approach and is \npart of the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC 6), jointly processed by several \ndevelopment  partners,  in  support  of  implementation  by  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the \nGovernment) of the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the program loan is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Over the last 20 years, Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been transformed significantly. It has \nbecome  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  Asia,  recording  average  annual  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5% over the last decade. GDP per capita increased from \n$288 in 1993 to $716 in 2006, with marginal increase in inequality. At the same time, the \npoverty incidence in the country declined sharply, from about 58.0% in 1993, to 28.9% in 2002, \nand 19.5% in 2004 (see Table A2.1 in Appendix 2).  \n \n3.  Economic growth in Viet Nam has been largely equitable. Expenditure inequality (as \nmeasured by Gini coefficient) has increased only marginally during the 1990s. Nonetheless, \nsome groups have benefited less and are vulnerable to social and economic marginalization. \nThese include people living with low levels of human capital, ethnic minorities, and to some \nextent, women. Social indicators (such as school enrollment and health care) are lower for \nthese groups. Low-income households face a vicious cycle of remaining poor due to difficulties \nin accessing health and education services, especially if user fees are involved.1 There are also \nconsiderable  disparities  in  poverty  and  poverty  reduction  across  regions.  The  northern \nmountains, the north central coast, and the central highlands all have high poverty incidence \nrates (over 30%), which are substantially higher than in other regions. These regions are home \nto nearly 57% of the total poor population.2  \n \n4.  The impressive outcomes of simultaneous continuing high economic growth and rapid \npoverty reduction were achieved through a combination of sustained business-led growth in \neconomic output and employment and government-led targeted poverty reduction interventions. \nThe  latter  include,  for  example,  programs  focusing  on  (i)  hunger  eradication  and  poverty \nreduction (Program 143); (ii) socioeconomic development in communes with extreme difficulties \n(Program 135); (iii) heath care for the poor (Program 139); (iv) compensation for job losses due \nto state enterprise reform (Social Safety Net Fund); (v) schooling at all levels, including adult-\nand-non-formal, and life-long learning (Education for All); and (vi) helping  ethnic minorities \ncatch up with the overall socioeconomic development (Advancing Ethnic Minorities). Viet Nam\u2019s \ntransition from central planning to a socialist-oriented market economic system has involved the \nliberalization of markets, recognition of private property rights, and a gradual opening up of the \neconomy to external markets for trade and investment. The growth of the private sector has \nbeen a significant feature of economic development. The structure of the economy is changing \nmarkedly, with a steady increase in the industrial and service sectors. Greater diversification in \nindustrial production and services is laying the foundations for sustained growth in output and \nemployment. \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2006.

Development Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n5.  The Government of Viet Nam is committed to poverty reduction and considers it to be an \noverarching objective in its national socioeconomic development process. Evidence  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment includes a series of strategic plans and documents, including the 10-\nYear Socioeconomic Development Strategy 2001\u20132010, the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction \nand  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  2002\u20132006,  the  5-Year  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan \n(SEDP) 2001\u20132005, and SEDP 2006\u20132010. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 is considered Viet Nam\u2019s \nnational strategy for poverty reduction and growth, which articulates the vision for Viet Nam to \nattain middle-income status by 2010. The SEDP is recognized as a blueprint for development, \nbecause  it  is  based  on  empirical  analysis  and  broad  consultation,  and  identifies  clear \ndevelopment outcomes, specifies policies to attain its goals, and aligns public resources to \nimplement these policies.  \n \n6.  Viet Nam\u2019s development strategy is embodied in the SEDP 2006\u20132010, which was \nendorsed by the National Assembly in June 2006. The SEDP is expected to be Viet Nam\u2019s new \nnational strategy for poverty reduction and growth. Reducing poverty incidence to 10\u201311% by \n2010 is an overarching goal of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. Its aims include, among others, to (i) \naccelerate and sustain economic growth and development; (ii) significantly improve people\u2019s \nmaterial, cultural, and spiritual life; (iii) create the foundations to boost industrialization and \nmodernization and to gradually develop a knowledge-based economy; and (iv) enhance Viet \nNam\u2019s status in the region and the world. The SEDP has a strong results-orientation, with \nperformance  indicators  that  include  the  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals  (VDGs)  and  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The SEDP was prepared in an intensively participatory \nand consultative manner with substantive inputs from a broad range of interest groups. The \nmain targets are specified to ensure sustainable development across the economy, society, and \nenvironment.  \n \n7.  In the SEDP, the Government embraces reform actions that fall broadly into four main \nareas: (i) the promotion of growth and transition to a market economy; (ii) reducing poverty and \nensuring social inclusion; (iii) managing the environment and natural resources in a sustainable \nmanner; and (iv) building institutions that can support the strategy. The first three pillars are \nexplicitly listed in the SEDP, while the fourth is introduced in the monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) framework. The fourth pillar is recognized as the foundation for making progress on the \nfirst three. Intended reform actions under the four pillars will be carried out with the goal of \nachieving middle-income status by end-2010. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank \nand  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  have  helped  develop  the  results-\nframework and M&E framework of the Government\u2019s SEDP in close collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners. Appendix 2 presents details on the SEDP in the context of PRSC \noperations.  \n \n8.  The Government and development partners realize that the impressive gains in poverty \nreduction realized to date remain fragile. In addition, achieving further poverty reductions will \nbecome increasingly difficult, as gains will be harder to  realize among more marginalized \ngroups. Providing services to rural poor and ethnic minorities who live in remote areas requires \nmore marginal resources. To help the poor in mountainous areas increase land use productivity, \nespecially productivity of forest land, the Government revised the Law on Forest Protection and \nDevelopment in 2004 and issued the related Forest Development Strategy (2006\u20132010) in \nFebruary  2007,  providing  guidance  on  moving  toward  more  social  and  community-based \nforestry. The strategy recognizes the forest-use rights of households and communities and their ", "    3 \nownership of plantation forests. The issuance of such strategies is one of the policy actions \nproposed in this program loan.  \n  \n9.  An additional factor complicating future poverty reduction is the large number of the \nnear-poor. A significant proportion of the population was just below the poverty line in 1993, and \nhad barely moved above the poverty line by 1998; they remain vulnerable to shocks that could \npush them  back below the poverty  line. Future challenges include  (i) allocating additional \nresources, (ii) the ability to mobilize external resources, (iii) improved targeting of resources, (iv) \nenhanced  efficiency  by  making  social  services  more  demand  driven,  and  (v)  improved \nmonitoring systems that ensure benefits actually reach the poor. \n \n10.  Viet Nam became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member in January 2007, and \nfurther  integration of  Viet Nam\u2019s  economy  into  the  global and  regional economy will help \nstimulate structural reforms and open access to markets, capital and technology, resulting in \nhigher economic productivity. Globalization and regional integration bring opportunities but also \nchallenges, including for groups employed by enterprises that are no longer competitive, and \nwhich consequently lose their jobs. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 has shifted the focus of priority areas \nfrom  basic  structural  reforms  to  more  complex  issues\u2014including  building  inclusive  and \nfinancially viable social insurance systems\u2014so as to respond to the needs of those negatively \nimpacted by global integration in the short term. The National Assembly passed the Social \nInsurance Law in November 2006, which is one of the policy actions under this program loan. \nOther priorities of the SEDP 2006\u20132010, which are also priorities of the PRSC operations, \ninclude (i) strengthening the supervision of financial markets, (ii) regulating access to and \npricing of infrastructure services, (iii) managing natural resources and protecting environment, \nand (iv) increasing transparency and accountability at all levels.  \n \nB.  Recent Economic Performance \n \n11.  Viet Nam is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, recording an average annual \ngrowth in GDP of about 7.5% over the last decade. Underpinned by rapid growth in private \ninvestment, strong consumption and robust exports, GDP growth accelerated to 8% for 2006 \nand an estimated 8.3% for 2007,3 above its trend rate of the last 10 years. Demand for the \ncountry\u2019s  exports  of  commodities,  crude  oil,  and  manufactures  was  strong,  and  private \ninvestment  and  private  consumption  also  recorded  robust  growth.  Growth  in  private \nconsumption was supported by rising incomes and inward remittances of about $4 billion in \n2006.  Increasing consumption is partly a result of favorable demographics, as Viet Nam has \none of youngest populations in Asia, with more than 65% of the population below 30 years of \nage. Retail sales of goods and services increased by 20.9% in 2006 (about 13% after adjusting \nfor inflation), higher than the 16.9% average recorded over the previous 5 years.  \n \n12.  Exports  performed  strongly  in  2006,  rising  by  23.0%  in  nominal  US  dollar  terms, \ncompared with average annual growth of 17% from 2001\u20132005. The ratio of exports to GDP \nincreased from about 55% in 2000 to 66% in 2006, indicating the openness of the economy \neven before Viet Nam joined the WTO in January 2007. The structure of exports is becoming \nmore diversified; while unprocessed commodities such as crude oil, rice, marine products, and \nagriculture products remain important, the share of manufactured products is rising. Robust \ndomestic demand, particularly from investment projects, caused imports to grow by 33.3%. As a \nconsequence, the trade deficit was estimated at $4.5 billion, equivalent to 8.7% of GDP in 2006. \nVigorous expansion in both private remittances and tourism receipts helped limit the current \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

Buoyant foreign direct investment (FDI) \ninflows supported the balance of payments, resulting in a rise in gross international reserves to \n$11.5 billion, equivalent to 3.5 months of imports in 2006.  \n \n13.  From the production side, the industry and services sectors contributed more than 90% \nof total GDP growth in 2006. Industry expanded by a robust 10.4%, slightly below the pace in \n2005. The services sector, supported by buoyant performance in trade, tourism, transportation, \ntelecommunications,  and  financial  services,  grew  by  an  estimated  8.2%,  higher  than  the \naverage of 2001\u20132005. Inflation remained high, exceeding 7% on average during 2006 for the \nthird year in a row. The high inflation rate was mainly a result of a jump in food prices caused by \nstrong demand. However, the inflation rate is projected to decrease in 2007 and 2008 due to \nreduced tariff rates following WTO accession, and expected reductions in crude oil prices in the \nworld market.  \n \n14.  The overall fiscal deficit remained high in 2006 at 5.0% of GDP, slightly above the 4.8% \naverage of the last five years so as to finance the required infrastructure investment. Fiscal \nrevenues surpassed the planned target by 10%. Total revenue (excluding grants) stands at 24% \nof GDP. This increase was attributable to higher oil revenues (accounting for about 29% of total \nrevenue),  improvements  in  tax  administration,  and  the  growing  number  of  tax-paying \nbusinesses in the formal sector. Off-budget expenditures rose from 1.2% of GDP in 2004 to an \nestimated 2% of GDP in 2006. These are mainly used for investment in infrastructure and \neducation. Investment in infrastructure now exceeds 9% of GDP and is expected to reach 11% \nin coming years. Off-budget expenditures are subject to the same scrutiny by the National \nAssembly as is budgetary spending.  \n \n15.   Viet Nam is a moderately-indebted country. At the end of 2006, public and publicly-\nguaranteed  debt  was  an  estimated  45.5%  of  GDP  in  nominal  terms.  External  debt  was \nestimated at around 32% of GDP. In 2006, total debt servicing is estimated at 5.6%, down from \n6.7% in 2004. Viet Nam\u2019s external debt indicators remained below the applicable threshold.  \n \nTable 1: Major Economic Indicators, 2004\u20132008 \n(%) \n     \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007e  2008e \n \nGDP growth  7.5  8.1  8.0  8.3  8.5 \nGross domestic investment/GDP   35.5     37.6     38.4     39.1     39.9 \nInflation rate (average for the year) 7.7  8.2  7.5  6.8       6.3 \nMoney supply (M2) growth   30.0     29.4     28.9     30.0     32.1 \nFiscal balance/GDP  (3.8)  (2.8)  (5.0)  (5.0)  (5.0) \nMerchandise export growth   33.1     22.5     23.0     19.0     20.0 \nMerchandise import growth   30.5     16.0     21.0     15.0     19.0 \nCurrent account balance/GDP  (5.7)  (3.6)  (2.1)  0.2  1.3 \nDebt service ratio  6.7  5.7  5.6  6.0  6.0 \n(#) = negative, e = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: General Statistics Office, State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of Finance, International Monetary Fund, Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) estimates. \nADB. 2007.

Under the baseline scenario of the International Monetary Fund- (IMF) World Bank debt \nsustainability assessment, public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to increase slightly, \nfrom about 41% of GDP in 2004 to around 43% in 2009, before stabilizing. In net present value \nterms, the debt increases from 28% of GDP in 2004 to about 29% of GDP and stabilizes over \nthe long term. The main risk to medium-term debt sustainability stems from contingent liabilities \nassociated  with  reform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs).  Given  the  uncertainty \nsurrounding bank balance sheets, the debt sustainability assessment considers two alternative \nreform scenarios, associated with contingent liabilities of 8% and 20% of GDP. In these two \nscenarios, the net present value of public debt reaches peaks of 35% and 49% of GDP before \ndeclining to 30% and 33% over the long term. The assessment will be updated in the third \nquarter of 2006 to reflect the impact of the investment program contemplated in the SEDP \n2006\u20132010. In addition, IMF has provided a letter of assessment (Appendix 3).  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Progress in Reducing Poverty \n17.  In aggregate terms Viet Nam\u2019s rapid progress in reducing poverty is unprecedented. No \nother country has reduced poverty incidence so much in such a short time.4 Data from the four \nViet Nam Household Living Standards Surveys (VHLSSs) conducted in 1993, 1998, 2002, and \n2004 reveal that Viet Nam has achieved remarkable success in poverty reduction during the \nperiod of 1993\u20132004; the poverty rate, as measured by per capita consumption, has dropped \nalmost 39 percentage points over this 11-year period. The poverty rate in 2004 was one-third \nthe 1993 rate, meaning Viet Nam outperformed the United Nations\u2019 Millennium Development \nGoal of halving extreme poverty over a 25-year period (1990 to 2015). The pace at which \npoverty rates have fallen has accelerated remarkably over the last few years. The poverty gap5 \nindicates that those who are still in poverty are becoming less poor. In 1993, consumption of the \naverage poor person was equal to 68% of the poverty line; by 2004, it had climbed to 76%. The \nremarkable performance in terms of income and expenditure is also supported by outstanding \nsocial indicators: improvements in the net enrollment rate, health insurance coverage, access to \nelectricity, clean water, sanitation, and possession of numerous durable goods reflect significant \nimprovements in people\u2019s wellbeing. During this period relative inequality, as measured by the \nGini index for per capita expenditures, has shown a modest increase, from 0.33 in 1993 to 0.37 \nin 2004. This is comparable to other countries at a similar level of development.  \n \n18.  When poverty and inequality are examined at disaggregate levels, however, significant \nvariation in progress in poverty reduction can be seen across different segments of society. \nAlthough declines in poverty have been achieved in all major segments of society, the rate of \ndecline has been slower in (i) rural areas than in urban areas, (ii) among most ethnic minority \ngroups in comparison to the majority group, and (iii) in some regions than in others. Poverty has \nbecome largely a rural phenomenon. Three out of eight regions6 of the country have suffered \n                                                 \n4  Between 1990 and 2004, the percentage of the population living in poverty in Viet Nam fell by roughly 3 percentage \npoints per year, or twice the rate of the People\u2019s Republic of China (when measured by the benchmark of $1 per \nday, adjusted by purchasing power parity).  \n5  The poverty gap measures the depth of poverty. It shows the shortfall from the poverty line of expenditure by the \npoor, expressed as an average of all people in the population.  \n6  The eight regions of Viet Nam comprise the northeast, the northwest, Red River Delta, north central coast, south \ncentral coast, central highlands, southeast, and the Mekong River Delta. The first two regions combined are \nconsidered the northern mountainous region.  \n ", "6 \nmost, with high poverty incidence and a poverty rate (in 2004) over 30%. In addition, the rate of \npoverty reduction has varied considerably across regions from 1993 to 2004. The pace of \npoverty reduction has been slowest in the northwest, and this region remains the country\u2019s \npoorest, with a persistently high poverty incidence of 59%. The 2004 survey suggests that the \nnorth central coast has the largest pocket of poverty, followed by the northeast, the Mekong \nRiver Delta and the Red River Delta. Progress in poverty reduction among ethnic minorities is \nrelatively limited. During the 11-year period, the poverty rate for ethnic minorities fell from 86% \nto 61%, while the poverty rate for the majority Kinh-Hoa group fell from 54% to 14%. There is \nalso significant underperformance by ethnic minorities compared to the majority group with \nregard  to  social  indicators.  Regional  and  ethnic  disparities  may  be  explained  by  the \ndisadvantaged living position of those involved, and a lack of regional convergence (footnote 2). \n \n19.  An understanding of the factors responsible for past achievements in poverty reduction \nwould  provide  guidance  for  future  policy  interventions.  There  is  consensus  that  poverty \nreduction has been underpinned by rapid, stable and inclusive economic growth.7 A series of \nfar-reaching  market  reforms  undertaken  in  the  1990s  and  early  2000s  has  resulted  in \nimprovements in the geographic and occupational mobility of labor, enabling people to take \nadvantage of better income-generating opportunities. The relatively pro-poor pattern of public \ninvestments and budget transfers, including national poverty-targeting programs (i.e., Program \n135 and Program 143) has led to improved access by the poor to education, health care, and \ninfrastructure.  Another  important  element  of  the  rapid  poverty  reduction  has  been  the \nredistribution of agricultural land to rural households. The allocation of land-use right certificates \n(LUCs) to lowland rural households amounted to a massive and egalitarian transfer of wealth. \nThis resulted in a dramatic increase in agricultural production and exports, and effectively \nhelped millions of households escape poverty. The three preceding loans (SIPRP I, II and III \nunder the PRSC 3\u20135 framework) have included these critical policy reforms. Political stability \nand  broad-based  growth  in  economic  output  and  employment  also  underpinned  poverty \nreduction. \n  \n20.  There are also reasons to believe that Viet Nam\u2019s future experience with poverty may \ndiffer somewhat from what has occurred in the past. The current distribution of incomes and \nexpenditures implies that a higher growth rate is required to achieve a one-percentage-point \ndrop in poverty. This calls for further strengthening of the existing national targeting programs \non  poverty  reduction.  In  addition,  the  relatively  large  number  of  non-poor  people  whose \nconsumption is just above the poverty line level implies that protecting vulnerable people from \nfalling back into poverty is becoming increasingly important for the reduction of overall poverty. \nParticularly, vulnerable groups are now facing various shocks\u2014including communicable disease \noutbreaks, natural disasters, and sharp dips in global agricultural commodity prices\u2014and may \nface these again in the future. The persistently high poverty incidence and depth among ethnic \nminority groups and some lagging regions is a big challenge for Viet Nam in the next five years. \nIn addition, new forms of poverty will emerge, caused in part by the process of urbanization. \n \n21.   In light of these challenges, sustaining rapid poverty reduction over the next five years \nwill require a combination of policy measures, including an acceleration of market-oriented \nreforms, and in particular an emphasis on development of the private sector to achieve higher \nefficiency. This would permit more rapid growth within resource constraints, as growth continues \nto be a main driver of poverty reduction. Innovative measures should also be used to enhance \n                                                 \n7  The elasticity of poverty reduction has been higher than one, e.g., a per capita growth rate of about 6% was \nassociated with a reduction in poverty of about 7% for 1993\u20132002 (Vietnam Development Report 2004 and \nVietnam Poverty Update Report 2006).  ", "    7 \nparticipation by the poor in economic growth. In addition, priority should be given to revamping \nand strengthening social protection mechanisms, including universal systems that can better \nprotect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  from  adverse  shocks,  in  light  of  intensified  international \nintegration.  \n \n22.  Various additional measures are required in addition to the current schemes supporting \nethnic minorities. These include (i) more unified control over forest land under the district and \ncommune authorities and (ii) improved transparency and equity in allocation of forest land and \nproduct usage rights. There is also a need for other innovative measures and interventions that \nbetter address the needs of the most disadvantaged ethnic minority groups and better take into \naccount their specific habits, customs, and culture.  \n \n  2.   The Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010  \n \n23.  The SEDP was finalized and approved by the National Assembly in June 2006. The \nSEDP was prepared with support of the development assistance community, including ADB, \nand in consultation with stakeholders and civil society (Appendix 2). Implementation of the \nSEDP  policy  reform  agenda  has  been  undertaken  largely  through  the  Government\u2019s  own \nresources, supplemented by pooling of ODA grant and lending resources under the PRSC 6\u201310 \nframework. The PRSC framework was prepared by development partners in close consultation \nwith government agencies. SEDP 2006\u20132010 includes open discussions about disadvantaged \ngroups and regions and about the challenges presented by the emergence of a growing gap \nbetween  socioeconomic  groups.  Issues  of  social  inclusion  are  no  longer  restricted  to  the \ndiscussion of targeted programs but are instead tackled in the sectoral sections of the plan.  \n \n24.  The  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The Steering \nCommittee was established in June 2007 to advise the Prime Minister on the developing and \nimplementing  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  and  Poverty \nReduction Support Credits in accordance to the purposes of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. Such \nsteering committee is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with an SBV deputy governor and a \nvice minister of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) as standing vice chairpersons. Its \nmembers  come  from  all  concerned  government  ministries  and  agencies.  The  steering \ncommittee guides implementation of the poverty reduction programs during PRSCs 6\u201310.8 The \nGovernment  undertakes  detailed  reviews  of  implementation  progress  of  the  PRSC  reform \nagenda, and discusses findings and emerging issues with its development assistance partners, \nusually at annual consultative group meetings.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n  1.   Problem/Constraints Analysis \n \n25.  The list of policy reforms considered by the SEDP 2006\u20132010 is remarkably broad. As \nthis program loan and its subsequent loans will support implementation of the SEDP, it is critical \nto prioritize and sequence those reforms. Supporting the PRSC reform agenda, which is based \non the SEDP reform agenda, does not entail favoring one of the four pillars over the others. \nInstead, balanced progress in all four pillars is critical for successful SEDP implementation. The \n                                                 \n8  This new steering committee was established to replace the original National Steering Committee, established in \n2002 for the purpose of implementing the poverty reduction programs under the CPRGS during the implementation \nof PRSCs 1\u20135. \n ", "8 \nprioritization and sequencing exercise should be carried out so as to be selective within each of \nthe pillars. \n26.  PRSC financing partners recognize that some of the needed reforms will be challenging, \nrequiring attention to their content and timeliness. In addition, the more complex post-WTO \naccession requires strong cross-sectoral coordination to implement WTO commitments from \nboth compliance and development standpoints. To ensure the SEDP is a sound plan that \ndelivers  growth  while  reducing  poverty,  the  Government  needs  to  continue  its  prudent \nmacroeconomic management and implement state sector reform without unnecessary delays.  \n \n27.  The policy actions under this PRSC were derived from a joint-donor analysis included in \nthe Viet Nam Development Report (VDR) 2007 that was published in December 2006.9 A small-\nscale technical assistance (TA) project (Support to the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction \nProgram II), approved on 9 June 2005, assisted in improving the quality of formulation and \nimplementation of this program loan, as well as the preceding three loans. This TA provided \nresources to enhance the program\u2019s compliance with safeguard policies. Through this TA, ADB \nalso provided funding to organize a consultative workshop for the preparation of the VDR 2007 \n(in November 2006), as well as a PRSC process review workshop (the PRSC Stocktaking \nWorkshop held in October 2005). The policy actions under the subsequent PRSCs will also be \nrefined based on results from subsequent analytical VDRs that will be published annually for \ndissemination at year-end consultative group meetings. Repeating the analytical and dialoguing \nprocess undertaken in the PRSC series will help ensure the content and timing of the numerous \nreforms that spread across multiple sectors is appropriate. The active engagement will provide \nthe  opportunity  for  all  stakeholders  to  identify  policy  actions  that  are  (i)  consistent  with \nnationally-owned development strategies and plans, (ii) sensible from an economic point of \nview, (iii) capable of making a considerable difference in practice, and (iv) sufficiently specific to \nbe adopted and implemented relatively quickly. \n \n2.  Country Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s goal is to help the Government reduce poverty incidence to 10\u201311% by 2010, in \nline with the Government\u2019s vision in the SEDP. The results-based approach adopted by the \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam 2007\u2013201010 is directly linked to \nsupporting the SEDP\u2019s targeted outcomes. The CSP indicates that Viet Nam is now facing the \nchallenge of improving its efficiency, as the investment to GDP ratio is already high by regional \nand international standards. This will require better management of public expenditure and \nresources, including sustained efforts to control corruption. Increasing the private sector share \nof total investment by creating an enabling environment and providing infrastructure will also \nhelp increase investment efficiency and accelerate job creation.  \n \n29.   ADB\u2019s country poverty assessment,11 which provided analytical inputs to the preparation \nof both the CSP and the previous PRSC, indicated that although economic growth in Viet Nam \nhas benefited most of society, some groups have benefited less than others. Poverty incident \n                                                 \n9 The annual VDRs, first published in December 2002, have provided crucial information and analyses on focal \nissues relevant to the Government\u2019s reform agenda. VDRs serve to coordinate views on what the reform \nchallenges are and how to address them, and have a considerable impact on the policy debate and the research \nagenda at the country level. The recent VDRs were prepared in partnership by PRSC cofinanciers, including ADB, \nwith substantive inputs on Viet Nam\u2019s development goals from Vietnamese policymakers and academics.  \n10  ADB. 2006.

Food poverty has been largely eliminated in \nurban households but rural households remain food-poor. The CSP identifies the key strategies \nfor reaching the poor in the coming years by (i) mobilizing and allocating more resources, (ii) \nimproving the targeting of resources, (iii) enhancing efficiency by making social services more \ndemand-driven, and (iv) improving monitoring systems to ensure that benefits reach the poor. \nAchieving further reductions in poverty is expected to be more challenging, requiring targeted \nefforts to reach more remote rural areas.  \n \n  3.  Lessons  \n \na.  Lending Modality \n30.  According to the 2001 special evaluation report on program lending by the Operations \nEvaluation Department (OED), the program\u2019s lending modality is a welcome alternative to \ntypical  program  loans,  which  are  generally  limited  to  two-tranche  programs.  The  report \nrecommended that multiple and floating tranches could effectively provide flexibility in meeting \nand preserving incentives for policy changes, in remaining engaged, and in adopting a long-\nterm outlook.12 The innovative lending modality for the PRSCs is also referred to in the recent \nOED study Good Practices for the Evaluation of Policy-Based Lending by Multilateral Banks.13  \n \n31.  While this program loan is processed as a single-tranche program loan, it is actually part \nof a multiple-tranche program loan series (PRSCs 6\u201310) supporting implementation of the \nSEDP  2006\u20132010.  The  lending  modality  for  the  PRSCs  is  (i)  based  in  part  on  past \nachievements, in that all policy actions have been achieved before loan approval, with loan \nproceeds to be disbursed immediately upon loan effectiveness, to finance adjustment costs \narising  from  agreed  reforms;  and  (ii)  forward-looking,  in  that  each  annual  PRSC  contains \nagreements on policy triggers considered a critical bridge between the current and next PRSC. \nPolicy triggers are policy reforming trends that are expected to evolve substantively during the \nsubsequent PRSC. Policy triggers are not intended to be stated in the manner of conventional \npolicy conditions, thus allowing for refinement of exact progress, according to the Government\u2019s \nreadiness to embark on such reform. (Appendix 2 indicates the policy areas considered critical \nfor the next PRSC operation by PRSC stakeholders.) \n \n32.  The PRSCs complement rather than replace other initiatives of ADB, the World Bank, \nand other development partners. They complement other analytical studies, policy dialogues, \nand  programs  and  projects,  and  vice  versa.  Following  ADB\u2019s  participation  as  one  of  the \nfinancing partners to PRSCs 3, 4 and 5 in the first 5-year PRSC cycle, ADB has confirmed its \nplan to participate in the current cycle. The program loans to support PRSCs 6\u201310 are included \nin the country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010. The coexistence of ADB sector-specific \nprogram loans and the PRSCs is seen as leveraging ADB\u2019s development efforts in Viet Nam \nwith  other  stakeholders.  PRSC  operations  also  provide  a  complementary  forum  to  aid \nharmonization in the country\u2019s development agenda.  \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2001. Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending. Manila.  \n13 ADB. 2005. Good Practices for the Evaluation of Policy-Based Lending by Multilateral Banks. Manila. (Available: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Evaluation/r-pbl.pdf.) \n \n ", "10 \nb.  Lessons from Previous PRSC Cycles \n33.  The main contribution of PRSCs has been their ability to serve as a platform for a \ncontinued  policy  dialogue  with  key  government  counterparts  on  a  broad  range  of  issues. \nHowever, given the encompassing nature of Viet Nam\u2019s reform program generally, and of the \nCPRGS agenda in particular, progress was not even across all policy areas.  Identifying strong \nand weak areas in policy making is essential to ensure the sustainability of this effort over time. \nStarting with PRSC 3, a set of indicators covering a broad range of policy areas was used to \nassess progress, but these indicators may need revision. Both the previous 5-year plan and the \nCPRGS lacked a monitoring and evaluation framework, with indicators instead derived from the \ntext of those documents and from other relevant sectoral strategies and policy statements. \n \n34.  Overall, progress was slower in those policy areas characterized by limited political will, \nconflicting institutional responsibilities or insufficient analysis. The speed at which progress was \nmade across policy areas within each pillar depended on the political will to implement the \nreforms.  The  contrast  between  the  rapid  progress  achieved  in  integrating  with  the  world \neconomy and the slow pace of reform in the banking sector is revealing in this respect. To some \nextent, this contrast may reflect a deliberate choice, in which rapid movement towards WTO \naccession would make inevitable the need for subsequent banking sector reforms. In other \ncases (e.g., water) limited progress reflects institutional overlap and unclear delineation of \nresponsibility across several ministries or agencies. In the case of corruption, there is an \nundeniable commitment to battle corruption, but it is recent, and in such instances progress \nmade on inputs (such as laws, or coordinating bodies) may take considerable time to translate \ninto progress on outputs and outcomes. Specifics aside, when policy areas are classified on the \nbasis  of  progress  the  results  are  consistent  with  the  ratings  prepared  for  the  country \nperformance assessment (CPA). Those ratings are above the regional average in relation to \nmacroeconomic management and social inclusion, and below the average in relation to the \nfinancial sector, labor and social protection, and transparency and anticorruption. \n35.  Identification and sequencing of a comprehensive PRSC reform agenda covering the \nmedium term requires strong analytical work. The VDR 2007, co-signed by 16 donors, provides \nthe main analytical underpinnings for the current 5-year PRSC cycle. The preparation of this \nreport,  entitled  Aiming  High,  started  shortly  after  approval  of  the  SEDP  by  the  National \nAssembly. The report was submitted to the consultative group meeting of December, 2006 as a \ncontribution by the international community to implementation of the SEDP. The report built on \nthe analytical work done over the previous PRSC cycle on structural reforms (as summarized in \nthe VDR 2006, Business), institutional modernization (VDR 2005, Governance) and on social \ninclusion (VDR 2004, Poverty). ADB has actively participated in formulating VDR 2007 by \ncontributing extensive written inputs and comments. Lessons from previous PRSCs and similar \nprograms  suggest  that  conducting  joint  analytical  work  between  development  partners  is \nimportant, along with wide consultation with academia, civil society, and the Government. The \ndevelopment partners and academia can assist the Government in terms of analytical tools and \nsharing  of  international  experience.  The  multiple-tranche  program  loan  approach  could  be \neffective in providing flexibility in meeting and preserving incentives for policy changes, and in \nmaintaining  ongoing  engagement,  with  a  longer-term  outlook  than  the  usual  two-tranche \nprogram loan.  \n \nc.  Asian Development Bank Policy-Based Lending \n36.  Lessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat  (i)  continued  government  ownership  and  commitment  are  fundamental  to  achieving ", "    11 \ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions, as (a)  passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if \nthe law is not brought into effect (which requires regulations, circulars, etc.), and (b) properly \nenforced (requiring institutional capabilities); and (iv) sector or subsector-based program loans \nhave limited scope to address economy-wide policy and institutional issues. \n \n4.  Justification for the Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit  \n \n37.  PRSC 6 addresses three key areas of macro policy and institutional reforms for (i) \nsupporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \nimproving  the  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally friendly, and (iii) modernizing governance and the public administration system. \nThe policy actions identified in the PRSC 6 policy matrix are built on the reform measures \nachieved  under  previous  PRSCs.  The  preparation  of  PRSC  6  was  built  on  the  strong \ncommitment by the ODA community to (i) support Viet Nam\u2019s reform agenda through nationwide \nimplementation  of  the  SEDP,  and  (ii)  galvanize  interest  for  the  reform  program  among \nstakeholders.  Development  partners  have  increasingly  united  around  the  PRSC  as  an \ninstrument for policy dialogue. They have been actively involved in supporting implementation of \nthe reform agenda, analytical work, technical assistance, project lending, and program lending \nor grant support. The rationale for providing financial support under PRSC 6 comes from the \nexternal financing needed to cover the cost of reform adjustments. The policy actions supported \nby  the  PRSC  process\u2014including  recapitalization  of  SOCBs,  operation  of  a  safety  net  for \nworkers  who  become  redundant  as  a  result  of  SOE  restructuring,  expansion  of  budget \nappropriations for the education sector, and creation of provincial health care funds for the \npoor\u2014entail a substantial additional cost to the Government.  \n \n38.  Justification  for  PRSC  6  is  grounded  on  three  criteria:  (i)  prudent  macroeconomic \nmanagement to ensure that progress on the long-term reform agenda will not be undermined by \nshort-term instability; (ii) the Government\u2019s own assessment of progress accomplished in SEDP \nimplementation; and (iii) the strategic reform actions for PRSC 6, which were identified based on \nanalytical input, and have been complied with.  \n \n39.  IMF\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance  confirms  the  country\u2019s \nimpressive overall record of economic performance in 2006 and broadly favorable prospects for \n2007 (Appendix 3). Based on the joint assessment by the World Bank and IMF, the SEDP is \nfiscally sustainable, despite the high level of investment associated with the development of \nlarge-scale  infrastructure.  The  baseline  scenario  of  the  most  recent  debt  sustainability \nassessment (DSA) is broadly in line with the investment and growth outlook of the SEDP. The \nDSA estimates that public and publicly-guaranteed debt will increase from nearly 44% of GDP in \n2005 to about 51% by 2011. This increase is still considered manageable, as more than half will \nremain on highly concessional terms. In addition, external debt (both public and private) is \nprojected to decline from over 32% to under 31% of GDP. Viet Nam should thus remain at low \nrisk of external debt distress.14   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 World Bank. 2007. International Development Association Program Document for a Proposed Credit to the \nSocialist Republic of Vietnam for a Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Operation. Washington, DC (23 May).  \n ", "12 \n5.  Rationale for the Proposed Program Loan \n \n40.  The ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC to be an important instrument for \nsupporting  SEDP  implementation.  As  a  multisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues \nrelated to poverty reduction, the PRSC framework provides ADB with an opportunity to (i) \nadvance and widen  the national  policy dialogue in a  well-coordinated and comprehensive \nmanner; (ii) provide lending and nonlending assistance in coordination with other ODA partners; \nand (iii) ensure that key policy issues affecting ADB operations in Viet Nam are addressed in the \npolicy dialogue between the Government and the ODA community, to help achieve the common \ngoal of poverty reduction and growth. \n \n41.  Eleven major ODA partners have planned to provide financial assistance under the \nPRSC 6 framework (Appendix 5). All financing partners participated in PRSC 6 preparation and \nare actively involved in those policy areas where they have strengths. Given the many active \ndevelopment partners in Viet Nam, several financing partners are involved in the same reform \nsectors. However, certain financing partners may have greater comparative advantage in a \nsubsector than others. For example, within the financial sector, the World Bank and Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC) specialize in banking reforms, while ADB specializes in \nnonbanking reforms. ADB has participated in policy dialogue related to many reform sectors in \ncomparison with other development partners. PRSC 6, which has a national economy-wide \nreform  agenda,  complements  these  ADB-assisted  activities  (Appendix  2,  Figure  A2.1).  In \naddition, ADB staff have actively participated in PRSC policy dialogue with other financing \npartners, thus ensuring synergy between the PRSC multisector policy actions and ADB sector-\nbased programs and projects. This allows ADB to verify that PRSC 6 conditions do not conflict \nwith policy conditions under ADB\u2019s ongoing sector loans. In fact, ADB\u2019s participation in this \ndialogue enables it to influence the reform agenda in a way that complements ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsector loans, because the PRSC provides a clear picture of ADB\u2019s intervention as part of and in \nrelation to the aggregated efforts of all of Viet Nam\u2019s development partners.  \n \n42.  The proposed program is expected to lead to substantial improvements in development \noutcomes. The current PRSC cycle covers the same 5-year implementation period as that of the \nSEDP. The targeted development outcomes under this PRSC cycle have been clearly identified \n(Appendix  6),  as  the  PRSC  process  has  been  supported  by  a  series  of  comprehensive \nanalytical reports underlining the formulation and implementation of previous PRSCs under the \npast 5-year cycle. The analytical reports have helped both the Government and development \npartners strategically identify and adjust policy actions adopted under the program. These major \nanalytical reports include the annual VDRs, which provide crucial information and analysis \nregarding focal issues relevant to the Government\u2019s reform agenda.  \n \n43.  To  reduce  the  transaction  costs  of  this  rather  complex  operation  for  both  the \nGovernment and the participating development partners, the proposed loan pursues a program-\nbased approach. This approach is in line with ADB\u2019s recent move and practices toward adopting \nprogram-based and sector approaches in its lending operations to reduce transaction costs for \nits developing member countries as well as for its own operations. The approach is not only \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s reform agenda,15 Long-Term Strategic Framework,16 and Medium-Term \nStrategy II,17 but also will directly help fulfill ADB\u2019s obligations to the Rome Declaration on \n                                                 \n15  President Chino\u2019s memo of 25 August 2004 entitled Today: Achieving Results Together.  \n16 ADB. 2001.

ADB  has  contributed  both  financially  and  intellectually  to  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of PRSC 6. VDR 2007, which is an analytical report underlining the design of \nPRSCs 6\u201310, was jointly prepared by 16 development partners and finalized in December 2006. \nAll PRSC 6 financing partners participated in the drafting of the VDR 2007. ADB staff have \nactively participated in several rounds of policy dialogue to refine the program loan\u2019s policy \nmatrix along with other donors and the Government.  \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s  own  projects  and  studies  have  contributed  to  several  of  the  policy  actions \nincluded in the program loan\u2019s policy matrix (Appendix 4) including, among others, the use of \nshare auctions as the main mechanisms for equitization (Financial Sector Program Loan II \n(FSPL II) and the preparatory TA for preparing FSPL III); reduction of processing time and \nrationalization  of  fee  structures  for  business  registration  (Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program  Loan  (SDPL)  and  the  preparatory  TA  for  preparing  SDPL  II; \nestablishment  of  consultative  mechanisms  to  streamline  licenses  (SDPL);  clarification  of \ncontract specifications, investor qualifications and treatment of proposals for build-own-transfer \nproject (a sector study on public-private partnership); adoption of the human immunodeficiency \nvirus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome law and preparation of action plans to scale-up \nharm reduction, fight stigma and discrimination (Health Care in the Central Highland Loan); \nunification of legal frameworks to address gender disparities and increase women\u2019s participation \nin decision making (TA Supporting the Preparation of the Law and Gender Equality); and \ndisclosure  of  the  results  of  inspections  against  corruption  for  cases  overseen  by  the \nGovernment Inspectorate (TA Capacity Building Support to Government Inspectorate).  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n46.  The program loan aims to provide support to Viet Nam\u2019s policy and institutional reforms \nthat  seek  to  maintain  high  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcomes  envisaged  include \nnumerous development targets that reduce structural weaknesses, promote socially inclusive \ndevelopment, protect natural resources, and modernize governance and public administration \n(Appendix  1) by  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program under  the policy \nframework of PRSC 6. To reduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan \nwill strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s reform program through 40 policy actions, 12 of which are tranche \nrelease  conditions  for  the  loan.  The  policy  matrix  is  presented  in  Appendix  4  and  the \ndevelopment  policy  letter  in  Appendix  7.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  provides  additional \ninformation on supporting documents demonstrating that all of the policy actions have already \nbeen complied with. The program\u2019s Summary Poverty Impact Assessment elaborates the effect \nof this program loan to the poor, and is presented in Appendix 8. The policy matrix comprises \npolicy measures that can be categorized into four reform pillars: \n \n(i)  Pillar  I:  business  development.  Promote  global  integration  to  improve  the \neconomy\u2019s  efficiency  and  resource  allocation,  enhance  transparency  and \naccountability  in  state  and  financial  sectors,  and  strengthen  the  regulatory \nframework  for  private  sector  and  infrastructure  development  to  create  an \nenabling business environment and improved livelihoods for the poor.  \n(ii)  Pillar  II:  social  inclusion.  Advance  human  development  by  upgrading  the \nquality of education, promoting inclusive education for disadvantaged children, \n ", "14 \nimproving access by the poor to health services, helping secure social protection \nfor the population, and promoting gender equality.   \n(iii)  Pillar III: natural resources. Encourage important policy measures leading to \nmore sustainable management of natural resources, including the protection of \nland, forests, water and the environment.  \n(iv)  Pillar IV: modern governance. Increase transparency and accountability of the  \nplanning  process,  public  financial  management,  and  public  administration, \nimprove legal transparency and accessibility as part of a broader effort to build \nmodern governance; and fight corruption.  \n \nThe possible approaches to mitigate potential risks in attaining the program\u2019s outcomes include \n(i)  upgrading  of  policies  related  to  the  banking  sector,  the  securities  market  and  the \nmanagement of public debt; (ii) improving data availability and analytical work on issues arising \nfrom rural-urban disparities; and (iii) making rapid improvements in transparency at various \nlevels. The potential risks and their mitigating measures will be discussed in detail in Section V \n(Program Benefits, Impacts, Assumptions, and Risks).  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n47.  The program loan\u2019s outputs include (i) policy advisory services by all PRSC participants \nto  assist  the  Government  in  formulating  and  implementing  the  reform  policies;  (ii)  laws, \nregulations, and policies that are conducive to reforms under the program framework; (iii) \namendment or strengthening of laws, regulations, and policies; (iv) action plans and strategies \nthat  are  strategically  important  for  attaining  targeted  development  outcomes;  and  (v)  self-\nassessments and sector studies that are of strategic importance. These were achieved through \n40 policy actions in the program\u2019s policy matrix. The following paragraphs will elaborate in detail \ncertain outputs achieved under the reform program through the strategic and critical policy \nactions under the program framework.  \n \n  1.  Pillar I: Business Development  \n   \n48.  Global Integration. The most important PRSC 6 policy actions in relation to global \nintegration were the granting of trading and distribution rights to all foreign firms, in line with \ninternational  commitments,  and  the  issuance  of  regulations  and  adequate  enforcement \nmechanisms to guide the intellectual property law. The trend in the area of global integration \nhas shifted from reducing barriers to trade in goods towards increased competition in services \nand considerable legal reform. This trend was boosted (on a multilateral as opposed to bilateral \nbasis) through Viet Nam\u2019s WTO accession in January 2007.  \n49.  SOE Reform. Significant progress in SOE reform occurred between mid-2006 and mid-\n2007, in the form of additional divestiture and better performance monitoring. The number of \nsectors in which 100% state ownership is to be retained was further reduced (from 29 to 19), \nand the remaining activities are primarily strategic in nature. This should lead to more SOEs \nbeing divested, with share auctions now utilized as the main mechanism for equitization, and \nthe participation of foreign strategic investors allowed. Although the state still retains a share of \nthe capital in many sectors and enterprises, additional steps have been taken to ensure that \nthese are managed efficiently. All SOEs are now classified according to their performance\u2014 \nbased on their turnover, profitability, servicing of debts and compliance with the law\u2014with the \nclassification results published. In addition, the exercise of ownership rights on behalf of the \nstate is being transferred from line ministries and provincial governments to the State Capital \nInvestment Corporation (SCIC), a for-profit organization under the Prime Minister. This transfer ", "    15 \nof ownership should resolve the conflict of interest that ministries and provinces formerly faced \nwhen formulating and implementing policies that affected the enterprises they ran. This also \nenables  a  shift  away  from  administrative  management  towards  commercially  oriented \nmanagement of SOEs. Corporate governance at the equitized SOEs is also expected to be \nimproved. The former holdings of line ministries and agencies in nearly 200 equitized SOEs \nwere  transferred  to  SCIC.  This  has  resulted  in  improved  corporate  governance,  as  SCIC \noperation is more commercially oriented. By 2006, the number of equitized SOEs totaled 3,060. \nThere were over 2,100 remaining SOEs, including 335 public utility companies and 295 public \nfarms. The Government plans to equitize 1,500 additional SOEs by end-2010. The Government \nalso accelerated the equitization of over 71 general corporations, with 20 scheduled to be \nequitized  in  2007.  A  number  of  large  general  corporations\u2014including  four  state-owned \ncommercial banks, telecommunication companies such as Viet Nam Mobile Telecom Services \nCompany (MobiFone), VinaPhone Telecoms Operator Service Company (VinaFone), and Hanoi \nand Saigon Brewery Companies\u2014are preparing their initial public offerings (IPOs). Overall, \nequitization helps improve the performance of enterprises. A survey of 550 equitized SOEs in \n2005 showed that 90 percent of the companies reported improved financial performance, with \nincreases in sales of 13% and profit increases of nearly 10%. Salaries of employees in those \ncompanies also increased.18  \n \n50.  The Government has requested ADB to provide assistance in (i) accelerating the pace of \nSOE  reform,  including  equitization  and  listing  on  the  stock  exchange;  and  (ii)  promoting \ndevelopment of a market-based and internationally competitive corporate sector by providing \nlong-term finance. A preparatory TA project and two subsequent program loans on SOE reform \n(SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facilities I and II) are included in Viet Nam CSP \n2007\u20132010.  \n51.  Financial Sector Reform. An important policy action under the previous program loan \nwas adoption of the ambitious banking reform strategy, which established a deadline of 2010 for \nequitization  of  state-owned  commercial  banks.  This  program  loan  now  focuses  on  the \nimplementation of a strategy aiming to strengthen the commercial orientation of SOCBs, which \nstill dominate the market, based on the assumption that regulation and technical upgrades alone \nwould not be sufficient to overcome the interference of non-commercial objectives in lending \ndecisions, especially at the provincial level. Introducing private capital in SOCBs, with the \nparticipation of strategic foreign investors with recognized resources and expertise, was seen as \nnecessary to accomplish this transformation. The program loan\u2019s policy actions under PRSC 6 \nprepared the ground for the equitization of two SOCBs, including one of the largest, over the \nnext year. The equity stake allowed to foreign strategic investors was increased, while all \nSOCBs were required to disclose their financial statements in line with internationally accepted \nstandards.  \n52.  Private  Sector  Development.  Policies  to  support  the  development  of  the  already \nvibrant private sector remain centered around the removal of administrative barriers to entry. \nThrough this program loan, processing time was reduced and the fee structure for business \nregistration was rationalized. The authority to issue investment certificates was clarified, more \ndetails were provided on sectors where investment is conditional, and the documentation for \ninvestment registration or evaluation was standardized. A consultative mechanism to streamline \nlicenses  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  a  new  investment-enterprise  regime  was \nestablished, and guidelines and options were issued for foreign investors to transition to such   a \n                                                 \n18 National Assembly. 2006. SOE Reform Report to the National Assembly 2006. Hanoi. \n \n ", "16 \nregime. The single-window mechanism for businesses was adopted in selected provinces and \ncovers registration, tax, and seal formalities. A monitoring mechanism to assess the constraints \nfaced by businesses was set up in parallel, under the form of an investment climate module \nattached to the enterprise survey, which is conducted every two years. The sample used for this \nmodule is representative at the provincial level, facilitating comparisons of business friendliness \nacross local authorities. \n53.  Infrastructure.  Mechanisms  are  being  set  up  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  public \nresources and the volume of private funding. In relation to public resources, the decentralization \nof investment ownership should lead to a better integration of capital and recurrent budgets in \nthe road transport sector. About 40 projects will be transferred to the Viet Nam Roads Authority, \nwhich previously was responsible only for the maintenance budget. The transfer of investment \nownership is expected to strengthen the Ministry of Transport\u2019s oversight function by separating \nits former dual role as project owner and supervisor. The adoption of wastewater charges based \non  cost  recovery  should  also  contribute  to  the  sustainability  of  investments  in  water  and \nsanitation.  This  measure  is  accompanied  by  appropriate  caps  to  protect  the  poor.  The \nmobilization of private funding for infrastructure projects should be facilitated by the newly \nissued  build-operate-transfer  decree,  which  clarifies  contract  specifications,  investor \nqualifications and treatment of unsolicited proposals. \n \n2.  Pillar II: Social Inclusion  \n \n54.  Education. The government strategy expanded coverage of high-quality schooling at \nlower levels with competition and incentives for excellence at higher levels. While the coverage \nof primary education has continued to expand, quality remains an issue, with children in poorer \nareas being at a disadvantage. Fundamental quality standard levels for schools were introduced \nunder the previous PRSC cycle, and a key policy action under this program loan extends \nperformance standards for primary teachers nationwide. The implementation of such standards \nwill rely on evidence-based assessments of teacher performance, as opposed to diplomas and \nseniority. In addition, transparent criteria for university admission quotas have been adopted on \na pilot basis. \n55.  Health. A fundamental transformation in the government\u2019s approach to HIV/AIDS has \ntaken place in recent years and is now being consolidated. Risky behaviors\u2014including the \npractice of commercial sex and the use of intravenous drugs\u2014were traditionally labeled as \n\u201csocial evils\u201d, often resulting in stigma and discrimination for the affected populations. That \napproach changed considerably under the previous cycle, with a new strategy emphasizing \nprevention  and  treatment  over  repression.  This  public  health  approach  is  reflected  in  the \nHIV/AIDS law passed in June 2006 and the subsequent preparation of a comprehensive set of \naction plans to expand harm reduction. These action plans foresee the introduction of needle \nexchange and methadone substitution programs. Meanwhile, an effort was undertaken across \nthe health sector as a whole to improve the budgetary balance between health infrastructure, \nhuman resources, subsidies and preventive care.  \n56.  Social Protection. The pension program design was improved, extending coverage and \nmake  its  compulsory  component  financially  viable.  Until  the  mid-1990s,  only  public  sector \nworkers were entitled to old-age, disability and survivor benefits, under a non-contributory \nprogram  funded  out  of  general  government  resources.  This  program  was  subsequently \nextended on a contributory basis to all formal sector workers, but old-age pension benefits \nremained determined by average salaries in the years preceding retirement. The period covered \nby this credit saw the passing of the first-ever Social Insurance Law, which determines pension ", "    17 \nbenefits for private sector workers on the basis of their average salary over all the years in \nwhich they contributed. In a rapidly growing economy, this average salary is substantially lower \nthan the salary in the years preceding retirement, so the law dramatically improved the financial \nviability of the system. It also introduced a voluntary pension program for farmers and informal \nsector workers, making it possible to gradually extend the coverage of the social insurance \nsystem. This voluntary program is currently in its design phase. However, current pension \nformulas retain shortcomings despite the system\u2019s stronger financial viability and its potentially \nbroader  coverage.  Under  the  new  law,  there  are  considerable  gaps  between  the  level  of \nbenefits for men and women, and for public and private sector workers. In addition, benefits are \nfar  removed  from  the  actuarial  benchmark,  which  encourages  relatively  short  contribution \nperiods and underreporting of earnings.   \n57.  Gender. While gender equality indicators are better in Viet Nam than in many other \ndeveloping countries, steps are being taken to narrow the remaining gaps. The passing of a law \non gender equality, a policy action taken under this program loan, is an important step in this \ndirection. It is recognized that regulation alone is not sufficient, as abuses are often unreported \nand enforcement capacities limited, but the new law does serve to unify the legal framework to \naddress gender disparities and increases women\u2019s participation in decision making. \n3.  Pillar III: Natural Resources  \n \n58.  Land  and  Forest.  Two  main  issues  stand  out  in  relation  to  land.  First,  forest \nmanagement remains largely under the control of state forestry enterprises (SFEs), which has \nresulted in a mixing of commercial and protective functions. There is a risk, however, that SFE \nrestructuring could lead to encroachment upon forest land by outsiders, to the detriment of local \npopulations, especially ethnic minorities, whose livelihoods depend to a large extent on the use \nof forests as a public good. To address this risk, the government issued the National Forest \nDevelopment Strategy, which is designed to strengthen linkages between the protective and \neconomic functions of forests, and to promote ownership by local households and communities. \nThe strategy addresses revisions to the 5 million hectare Forest Plan, and aims to improve the \nbalance between forest protection and multi-purpose forestation, and promotes policies that \nencourage farmers to live with the forests.  \n59.  The second critical issue faced by Viet Nam in relation to land management concerns \nland conversion, reclamation and resettlement in the context of rapid urbanization. Close to one \nmillion people may be moving every year to urban and peri-urban areas, and there is extensive \nclearing of land for infrastructure development or to host industrial parks. Lack of transparency \nin reclamation and conversion plans may result in sizeable capital gains for those with access to \nthe relevant information, while insufficient compensation for affected populations is leading to \nrecurrent social unrest. The Land Law, approved under the previous PRSC series, paved the \nway for the use of market prices as the basis for compensation. But gaps remained in relation to \nland occupants lacking appropriate tenure documentation, which is common, as the transfer of \nland to households and firms is still ongoing in Viet Nam. Under PRSC 6, resettlement and \ncompensation procedures have been clarified for those cases where occupants lack a land use \nright certificate (LUC), and mechanisms have been set up to handle complaints. \n60.  Environment. Development sustainability also depends on the appropriate control of \npollution and environmental damage resulting from both public and private sector business \nactivities.  Considerable  progress  was  made  during  the  previous  cycle  on  the  use  of \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  for  large  investment  projects.  This  program  loan  now \nrequires both mandatory consultation with communities where projects are to be located and \nincorporation of local feedback when reporting back to the relevant authorities. \n ", "18 \n4.  Pillar IV: Modern Governance \n \n61.  Planning Process. The transformation of planning processes\u2014from the direct allocation \nof resources to the strategic steering of the economy\u2014has continued during the current 5-year \nperiod of the SEDP 2006-2010. In the command and control economy, the MPI would play the \nrole of an arbiter in the selection of investment projects submitted by various government \nbodies. With investment decisions devolved to the National Assembly and People\u2019s Councils, \nthe role of MPI has shifted towards the allocation of the budget envelope available for capital \nexpenditures. Norms were adopted to allocate state capital expenditures transparently across \nprovinces,  using  criteria  such  as  population,  poverty  and  ethnicity,  and  served  to  make \nconsiderably  more  resources  available  to  poorer  provinces.  In  addition,  regulations  were \nadopted for the preparation of regional development plans, specifying responsibilities, requiring \ndisclosure,  and  requiring  that  infrastructure  master  plans  be  based  on  broader  regional \ndevelopment  plans.  As  a  result,  issues  such  as  comparative  advantage,  land  use  and \npopulation flows are expected to gain importance in determining infrastructure network layouts. \n62.  Public Financial Management. Public financial management reform has focused on \nstrengthening systems and increasing transparency. The State Audit of Viet Nam (SAV) was \nestablished as a specialized agency under the National Assembly towards the end of the \nprevious cycle, resulting in the first-ever disclosure of the SAV audit results and annual audit \nplan. In addition, a report on budget execution for the current year and the budget plan for \nforthcoming  year  were  both  published;  these  will  be  published  annually  in  the  future. \nRegulations were also issued requiring periodic disclosure of the amount and composition of \nexternal public debt, signaling an increased emphasis on the management of resources and \nliabilities, as compared to the previous focus on public expenditures. In addition, a regulation to \nguide the establishment and issuance of benchmark government bonds was implemented, and \nthe administrative procedures for all taxes were consolidated into a single law, modernizing \nassessment and enforcement methods. \n63.  Legal Development. Increased oversight of government actions at both national and \nlocal levels has been a common theme underlying the legal reforms adopted under this program \nloan. The National Assembly has become increasingly active in its supervisory role, especially \nsince the passing of the Budget Law of 2002. This trend was reinforced recently with the \nestablishment of separate legal, judicial, economic, and budget committees, which are expected \nto include a greater proportion of permanent members than in the past. A key new task of the \njudiciary committee will be overseeing the Government\u2019s anticorruption activities. A separate \nlegislative committee will be in a better position to ensure consistency between different laws, \nimprove the quality of their drafting, and coordinate the assessments and recommendations of \nthe various National Assembly committees on proposed legislation. A similar trend is noticeable \nat local levels. A new ordinance on grassroots democracy strengthens information disclosure, \npublic participation, and accountability of officials in the preparation and implementation of \ncommune-level policies. Recent legal developments have also aimed at promoting access to \njustice and recognizing civil society organizations. Under this operation, legal aid mechanisms \nfor marginalized and vulnerable groups were simplified and broadened, and policies adopted \nencouraging the participation of non-state establishments in the delivery of public services. \n64.  Fighting Corruption. The Government is now moving to implement its anticorruption \nprogram. Key laws and regulations have been passed, including the pivotal Anticorruption Law. \nThe  current  challenge\u2014of  translating  resolve  into  action\u2014has  been  addressed  in  part  by \nseveral measures adopted during the period covered by this credit. These include establishment \nof a steering committee against corruption, headed by the Prime Minister, which has the power ", "    19 \nto suspend high-level officials if they are suspected of wrongdoing. It is already engaged in \ninvestigating some high-profile cases, and the findings are to be made public. In addition, the \noffice  of  the  national  steering  committee  was  set  up  under  the  Anticorruption  Law  as  an \nindependent entity, which does not belong to the existing government agency system. The \nresults of corruption investigations in cases overseen by the Government Inspectorate were \ndisclosed, and a legal framework established to protect and reward corruption-related whistle-\nblowing.  \nC.  Important Features \n65.  An environmental assessment has been prepared for the policy matrix of the program \nloan in keeping with the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the environmental safeguard \nrequirements of ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines.19  \n \n66.  On balance, the reforms proposed as part of this program loan are expected to have \nwide-reaching positive impacts on socioeconomic conditions  throughout Viet Nam and  will \nassist the Government fulfill its development objectives as outlined in the SEDP. The majority of \nthe proposed reforms are likely to have either a positive impact or no impact. Where possible, \nenhancement  measures  have  been  developed  for  integration  into  the  reform  process  to \noptimize the predicted positive impacts. Two series of reforms\u2014those relating to (i) an increase \nin granting of trading and distribution rights to foreign firms, and (ii) to increased private sector \ndevelopment\u2014have been identified as having an unknown impact, because of their potential to \nresult in both positive and negative effects. Mitigation measures have been developed to offset \nany potential adverse impacts and maximize their positive impacts. No reforms have been \nidentified as having a negative impact. \n \n67.  Monitoring relating to environmental issues will be integrated into the overall monitoring \nprogram developed for PRSC operations; a series of suggested environment-related monitoring \nindicators has been developed for this purpose.  \n \n68.  The program loan will not have any impact on involuntary resettlement or on indigenous \npeople, as it has no investment component. None of the policy actions associated with this \nprogram will trigger any activities related to indigenous people during the implementation period. \nThe current PRSC cycle recognizes the potential risk of income disparity between urban and \nrural as well as the Kinh majority and ethnic minorities, as did PRSC 5. The Government is \naware of this potential risk and commits to formulating and implementing preventative and \nmitigating measures. This potential risk is not viewed as being likely to damage Viet Nam\u2019s track \nrecord on these issues during the short program implementation period. A social and poverty \nimpact assessment was undertaken in relation to the program loan (see Appendix 8). The \nassessment concludes that the activities will have no adverse impacts on indigenous people, \nand no gender implications.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n69.  A total of about $354 million for PRSC 6 operations is expected to be funded through \nODA  resources.  The  World  Bank  has  already  approved  a  $175  million  credit  from  the \nInternational  Development  Association  to  support  PRSC  6.  Financing  partners  providing \nconcessional loans include ADB ($15 million), JBIC (\u00a53.5 billion), and Germany (\u20ac6 million). \nFinancing partners providing grants include Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional (\u20ac5 \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2003.

Swiss Development Cooperation, while not a \nfinancing partner, provided financial support for coordination of the process.  \n \n70.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources as ADB\u2019s support to SEDP implementation following the policy framework of PRSC 6. \nThe  program  loan  would  contribute  to  financing  the  costs  of  adjustment  resulting  from \nimplementation of the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for PRSC 6, and to supporting \nand  facilitating  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform  program  for  poverty \nreduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \n71.  The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing \ndate will be 31 December 2008. \n \n72.  Some of the reforms supported by PRSC 6 entail substantial cost to the Government to \nfinance.  Policy  measures  supported  by  the  PRSC  operations,  such  as  the  safety  net  for \nredundant SOE workers, recapitalization of SOCBs, provincial healthcare for the poor, and the \nincreased education budget allocation require additional spending. These are costly and specific \nto the PRSCs. The cost of adjustment of the PRSCs is therefore greater than the cost of these \nclearly PRSC-specific items, which is estimated to range from more than $300 million to more \nthan $700 million per year from 2002 to 2006. The estimated cost of some specific PRSC-\nrelated measures for the PRSC 6 implementation period is approximately $1,420 million, i.e., (i) \nhealth  care  funds  for  the  poor,  about  $90  million;  (ii)  increased  spending  on  education \nproportional to the Government budget, about $540 million; (iii) social safety net program for the \nretrenched SOE workers, about $100 million; and (iv) SOCB recapitalization, about $690 million.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n73.  SBV, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall program implementation, \nincluding administration and disbursement of loan proceeds, maintenance of accounts, and \npreparation of semiannual progress reports on program implementation. The program is being \nimplemented through all line ministries and government agencies in accordance with the loan \nagreement. While the ODA funds raised through the PRSC process provide resources to the \nstate budget to implement the reforms, the PRSC operations have also served as an effective \ncoordination device between the Government and the many development partners. On behalf of \nthe  Government,  SBV  coordinated  the  overall  processing  of  PRSC  6.  The  World  Bank \ncoordinated the process for the development partners. The number of financing partners has \nsteadily increased, from 4 in PRSC 1 (approved in 2002) to 11 for PRSC 6. The development \npartners  have  participated  in  the  PRSC  process  by  forming  working  groups  with  the \nGovernment that cover all economic policy areas. Staff of ADB\u2019s Viet Nam Resident Mission \nhave actively participated in several other working groups including the small- and medium-\nsized  enterprise  (SME)  development  partnership,  financial  sector  partnership,  and  public \nadministrative reform partnership. Given the comprehensive nature of the PRSC reform process ", "    21 \nand the ever-growing number of financing partners, in January 2005 SBV established a program \ncoordination unit, comprised of competent staff. The unit deals with the program agenda, \nincluding monitoring and reporting, awareness raising, capacity building, and reform outcome \ndissemination. It has frequently interacted with the World Bank and the financing partners of \nPRSC 6, including ADB. \n \n74.  The Steering Committee was established in June 2007 to advise the Prime Minister in \ndeveloping and implementing the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and \nPoverty Reduction Support Credits in consistence with the purposes of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nSuch steering committee is chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms, \nand consists of representatives from relevant line ministries and government agencies. An SBV \ndeputy governor and a vice minister of the Ministry of Planning and Investment act as the \nstanding vice chairpersons. To represent PRSC policy reform areas, the steering committee has \nseveral representatives from key economic ministries (e.g., the ministries of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment; education and training; finance; foreign affairs; justice; industry and trade; and \nlabor, invalids, and social affairs; and), as well as the Office of the Government.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n75.  The program period is from 30 June 2007 to 31 December 2008. \n \n3.  Disbursement and Procurement  \n76.  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nloan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative list of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  9).  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,20 the proceeds of the program loan \nwill be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired,  provided  the  value  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed. The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \ndocumentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. As such, the \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the use of counterpart funds, are \nfelt to be satisfactory. \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n77.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan agreement.  \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1998.

Strengthening  the  management  of  public  expenditures  has  been  a  priority  of  the \nGovernment over the last decade and significant progress has been made in this respect. A first \ncountry financial accountability assessment (CFAA)21 was undertaken in 2000\u20132001. A public \nexpenditure  review-integrated  fiduciary  assessment  (PER-IFA)22 carried  out  in  2004  and \npublished  in  2005,  provided  an  update  and  review  of  the  implementation  of  the \nrecommendations  of  the  2001-CFAA  and  also  suggested  reforms  in  other  areas.  The \ngovernment has made steady progress in implementing the 2004 PER-IFA recommendations. \nMajor developments in public financial management include empowering the National Assembly \nwith  increased  government  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources;  increasing \ntransparency  for  all  agencies  using  budget  resources,  including  SOEs,  public  investment \nprojects and statutory funds; establishing the SAV as a technically independent unit under the \nNational  Assembly;  and  gradual  integration  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures  through \nforward-looking  budgets  and  resource  allocation  norms.  Twenty-six  national  private  sector \naccounting and 37 auditing standards consistent with international practice have been issued. \nThe government is currently making a major investment in a new and integrated Treasury and \nBudget Management Information System (TABMIS). Progress is being made in developing new \nbusiness processes for TABMIS, including (i) a unified Chart of Accounts, (ii) further integration \nof  recurrent  and  capital  budget  execution  processes,  (iii)  clarification  of  issues  related  to \nreporting ODA  on budget, and (iv) development  of  standard reports  to  strengthen budget \nexecution. \n \n79.  The World Bank and MOF commenced preparation of the CFAA Update in April 2007 in \nconsultation with and with the participation of many other development partners, including \nADB,23 AusAID, Canada, Denmark, DFID, EC, France, Germany, Ireland, and Sweden. The \nfinal report will be available in late 2007. The update will provide an assessment of public \nfinancial management by examining budget development, budget execution and accounting, \ninternal and external reporting, internal controls, internal and external auditing, monitoring and \nlegislative oversight and scrutiny, financial management capacity and financial accountability \nrisks.  \n \n80.  The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management systems, (budgeting, \naccounting, reporting and auditing) are assessed as moderate. Since the IMF does not currently \nhave  a  program  in  Viet  Nam,  it  is  not  possible  to  rely  on  its  assessment  of  the  control \nenvironment of the SBV. However, the enactment of the Audit Law of 2005 helps address the \nissues related to audit and accounting arrangements. The Audit Law has established the SAV \nas an independent institution reporting to the National Assembly, with the auditor general being \nappointed and dismissed by the National Assembly. Audit reports were made public for the first \ntime in 2006. The SBV will be subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n81.  The Government will prepare and provide progress reports on the program loan. ADB \nwill participate in all joint assessments by the Government and development partners on the \n                                                 \n21  World Bank. 2001.

Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n82.  Progress in the implementation of the program loan\u2019s reform agenda will be monitored in \nparallel with the SEDP M&E framework through a well\u2013defined, streamlined set of development \nindicators. The SEDP M&E framework was developed by MPI, with support from ADB, World \nBank  and  UNDP,  and  in  close  consultation  with  line  ministries.  Some  indicators  in  the \nframework are common with the National Statistics Indicator System (NSIS) developed by the \nGeneral Statistics Office (GSO); others, although not included in the NSIS, can be calculated \nfrom  Viet  Nam  Household  Living  Standards  Survey  data.  Data  for  a  few  others,  e.g.  for \nassessing satisfaction with government services, will have to be collected.  \n \n83.  PRSC 6 will continue to build on its successes in the previous 5-year PRSC cycle in \nstreamlining  numerous  ongoing  M&E  initiatives.  Key  sources  of  monitoring  information  for \npoverty  and  program  outcomes  include  the  proposed  biannual  household  living  standard \nsurvey, periodic participatory poverty assessments, small business registration survey, public \nexpenditure tracking survey, as well as quarterly progress reports from the relevant sector \nministries and committees implementing the reform program. In some areas the set of indicators \nproposed in the VDR goes beyond the SEDP M&E framework; this is the case in relation to \ngovernance, where monitoring experience is limited and there is less experience in the use of \nenterprise  and  household  surveys,  as  opposed  to  administrative  self-reporting.  However, \nbecause reliable data need to be collected from surveys and other sources with demanding \nimplementation  requirements,  the  monitoring  of  progress  towards  development  outcomes \ncannot be conducted on an annual basis. It is expected that the new PRSC cycle will involve \nsome annual monitoring but only two in-depth assessments, towards the middle and at the end \nof the cycle. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n84.  First, through policy actions designed to facilitate business development, the loan will \nincrease efficiency, accelerate economic growth, and create jobs. These policy actions will help \nimprove the regulatory framework for private sector development, and enhance transparency \nand accountability in SOE operations and in banking. Second, policy actions addressing social \ninclusion will result in benefits that include improved quality of education, improved access of \nthe poor to health services, a reformed social protection system, and promotion of gender \nequality. Third, through policy actions addressing natural resources, the loan will help secure \nland ownership and address the resettlement and compensation process, as well as promoting \nmore sustainable management of natural resources. Fourth, through policy actions addressing \nmodern  governance,  benefits  include  increased  transparency  and  accountability  of  public \nfinances, and improved legal transparency and accessibility. These will be achieved through \nbetter coordination of plans and budgets, adoption of the medium-term expenditure framework, \nand greater accountability in public finance and public administration. \n   \n85.  Three  potential  risks  are  associated  with  emerging  imbalances  accompanying  Viet \nNam\u2019s entry into a new phase of development, with greater global integration and a more \nmarket-oriented economy. The first potential risk is the vulnerability that stems from possible \nturbulence in the financial sector, as the supervisory and regulatory capacity of  monetary \nauthorities has not matched the expansion in capital markets. The second risk relates to the \nmassive inflows of FDI and increased competition in formerly protected sectors. This change \n ", "24 \nmay test the ability of Viet Nam to preserve social inclusion, and may cause some groups to \nlose in the short term. The third possible risk involves potential corruption and social strife \nrelated to rapid urbanization and infrastructure development. \n \n86.  Through  appropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs  undertaken  during  program \nimplementation, the Government will take steps to mitigate potential risks. ADB, along with other \nPRSC financing partners, has conducted analytical studies to help policymakers formulate and \nexecute  mitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these  potential  risks.  These \ncorrective measures have been included in the proposed series of PRSCs, which includes this \nprogram loan. The first risk\u2014related to imbalance in the financial sector\u2014could be addressed \nby rapid upgrading of policies related to the banking sector, the securities market and the \nmanagement of public debt, all of which are part of the proposed reform program. The second \nrisk\u2014related to social inclusion and environmental sustainability\u2014could be mitigated by the \nstrong commitment of the Government to keep growth inclusive and sustainable. This risk could \nalso be addressed through improvements in data availability and analytical work on issues \narising from rural-urban disparities, which are included as part of the PRSC process. Rapid \nfeedback channels from affected stakeholders, inclusive policies in the social sectors, and \ntransparent mechanisms to transfer resources to poorer regions are among the mitigating \nmeasures supported by the proposed series of operations. The third risk\u2014related to corruption \nand  social  strife  caused  by  rapid  urbanization  and  infrastructure  development\u2014could  be \naddressed by making rapid progress in transparency at various levels, including in regional \nplanning, infrastructure master plans, land use and appropriate taxation, and monitoring of the \nassets of relevant civil servants.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n87.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SBV  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Such measures and actions will continue to be in effect for the sustainability of \nthe poverty reduction program under the SEDP and PRSC frameworks. \n(ii)  Adequate and timely counterpart funds will be provided for the implementation of \nthe poverty reduction program under PRSC 6. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n88.

", "Appendix 2  31 \nSri SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  The 5-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan as the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy \n \n1.  Formulation of the Plan \n \n1.  Comprehensive  economic  reforms  undertaken  during  the  last  Poverty  Reduction \nSupport Credit (PRSC) cycle have led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on \ndevelopment outcomes. Viet Nam has been among the fastest-growing economies in the world \nfor  almost  two  decades.  There  was  a  considerable  acceleration  of  reforms  around  2001, \njustifying the first 5-year PRSC cycle, and then again in 2006. The former involved (i) the \npassing of an enterprise law that greatly facilitated business registration and operation, (ii) the \nsigning of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States that strengthened global integration \nand resulted in important legal improvements, and (iii) the adoption of the first serious steps \ntowards  state-owned enterprise (SOE) divestiture and the strengthening of public financial \nmanagement. Emerging from massive poverty less than two decades ago, Viet Nam is now \naiming to attain middle-income status by 2010.  \n \n2.  The new socioeconomic development plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 articulates the aim to \nattain middle-income status by 2010, reflecting the transition towards strategic planning for a \nmarket economy. The SEDP, approved by the National Assembly in June 2006, illustrates the \ndepth of Viet Nam\u2019s transition. Unlike previous 5-year plans, which focused on quantitative \ntargets as if the state was still in charge of producing most goods and services, the SEDP \nemphasizes development outcomes and the policy reforms needed to attain them. It relies on \ndata  analysis  rather  than  administrative  reporting  to  substantiate  its  diagnosis  and \nrecommendations. It has also led to the adoption of a framework to monitor progress towards \nattaining development outcomes.  \n \n3.  The official development assistance (ODA) community has aligned its efforts behind the \nSEDP, while acknowledging that other key documents will shape reforms in the coming years. \nSuch  alignment  is  a  testament  to  the  strong  ownership  of  the  reform  program  by  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam (the Government). It also reflects satisfaction with the process through \nwhich  the  SEDP  was  prepared.  Above  all,  the  SEDP  is  seen  as  both  a  credible  and  a \nsustainable strategy to foster economic growth and poverty reduction. It is credible because of \nthe ambitious policy reforms it proposes, which are organized around three pillars: (i) supporting \nbusiness development, (ii) keeping growth inclusive, and (iii) better managing natural resources. \nA fourth, underlying pillar concerns the need to modernize institutions so as to deliver on the \nother three fronts. The SEDP is seen as sustainable because it should lead to manageable \nlevels of public debt by 2010. \n \n4.  Unlike the previous SEDP, the new SEDP is focused and clearly defines development \ntargets, identifies appropriate policies to attain those targets, and aligns resources to those \npolicies.  The  country\u2019s  development  goals,  which  are  a  local  version  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, are among the key targets pursued in the SEDP (Table A2.1); this parallels \nhow key targets were pursued in the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \n(CPRGS) that governed the previous PRSC cycle.  \n \n5.  The SEDP provides a framework for poverty reduction policies, programs, and actions in \nViet  Nam  (Figure  A2.1).

Hanoi. \n \n2.  The Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process  \n \n6.  The policy actions supported through the PRSC process can be seen as a distillation of \nthe SEDP and other development strategies and plans. The PRSC policy actions are aimed at \nidentifying  a  coherent  sequence  of  key  measures  in  each  area  over  the  medium  term. \nIdentification of the policy actions needed to attain the development outcomes documented in \nthe SEDP has been strongly influenced by the progress reports of the implementation of the \nprevious National Poverty Reduction Strategy, namely the CPRGS, and analytical work carried \nout by the development partners. The annual Viet Nam Development Reports (VDRs)\u2014which \nare prepared in partnership by the World Bank and other development partners, including the \nAsian Development bank (ADB)\u2014 have played a very important role in this respect. In addition \nto the CPRGS and PRSC-related studies and reports, sector work reports and assessments \ndone under each development partner\u2019s sector-based programs and projects also provide input \nto ensure the complementarity and efficiency of the PRSC reform agenda. Table A2.2 illustrates \nthe timing and relation of the strategy, implementation, analyses, and sector work.  \n \n3.  Contribution: Financial and Intellectual \n \n7.  The ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC an important instrument for \nsupporting SEDP implementation. ADB and other major ODA partners\u2014including Australia, \nCanada, Denmark, European Commission, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, and \nthe United Kingdom\u2014have joined with the World Bank and contributed both financial and \nintellectual resources to PRSC 6. Switzerland, while not a financing partner to PRSC 6, partially \nfunds the PRSC Program Coordination Unit, which is responsible for coordinating the PRSC \nprocess between government agencies and development partners. The International Monetary \nFund (IMF), France, and United Nations Development Programme, as well as the United States \nAgency for International development, also participate in policy dialogue to provide intellectual \ncontributions to the PRSC process.  \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  In  addition  to  providing  resources  to  fill  the  Government\u2019s  financing  gap  for  the \ncomprehensive reform agenda, PRSC operations have served as an effective coordination \ndevice, supported by an increasingly large number of development partners. The steering \ncommittee for the PRSCs has been led by the deputy prime minister in charge of economic \nreforms, and brings together representatives from all relevant line ministries and government \nagencies. On the development partners\u2019 side, PRSC operations have been cofinanced by \nseveral  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies,  either  through  grants  or  parallel  lending.  More \nimportantly, the process saw a transition in the role of financing partners, from providers of  \nfinance  to  partners  substantially interests and technical capacity on the ground. The number \nof development partners participating in this process has increased from 4 in PRSC 1 to 11 in \nPRSC 6. All development engaged in the preparation of operations and policy dialogue with \ngovernment. This dialogue is organized by policy areas, in  which  development  partners \nengages electively,  based  on  their partners who seriously consider the possibility of partnering \nin this process are invited to participate in the preparation of PRSC operations, even if they \ncannot  commit  to  cofinance  them  in  the  short term.

The PRSC group dominates the development assistance landscape in \nViet  Nam  related  to  the  education  and  health  sectors,  environmental  sustainability,  land \nmanagement, legal development, and public financial management; these were all part of \nPRSC 2, while PRSC 3 and 4 further broadened sectoral coverage. \n \nB.  Public Financial Management  \n \n9.  The World Bank and other PRSC financing parters, except for the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and ADB, consider PRSCs to be budget support operations. \nFor ADB, the program loan that cofinances PRSC 6 is considered a sector-wide approach \nprogram, with loan proceeds supporting the Government\u2019s financing gap, which is caused by \nthe Government\u2019s engagement in reform endeavors covered by the program. The proceeds are \nin foreign exchange, with the loan agreement governing the use of the proceeds to purchase \nimport goods. The justification for providing lending assistance for the PRSC is based on \nsatisfactory financial management arrangements for the program, which are ultimately related to \nthe Government\u2019s public financial management. The following paragraphs offer an analysis of \nViet Nam\u2019s fiscal stance and public financial management, which is presented in addition to the \nexplanation in section IV E.4 Financial Accountability and Fiduciary Assessment (paras. 78\u201380 \nin the main text).   \n \n1.  Overall Fiscal Trend \n \n10.  Viet Nam has been widely acknowledged for its fiscal prudence, with relatively small \nbudget deficits and a relatively small stock of both domestic and external debt. Viet Nam\u2019s fiscal \nstance has remained extremely prudent, with the budget deficit averaging less than 2% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) over the period 1999\u20132003 and the stock of debt remaining under 40% \nof GDP. The country has received increasingly solid grades from international organizations, \nforeign governments and sovereign risk rating agencies.  \n \n11.  The investment to GDP ratio increased from 28.3% in 1997 to 35.1% in 2003 and 41% in \n2006. The share of the public sector in GDP has averaged 56%, that of the domestic private \nsector 24%, and of the foreign invested private sector 20%. High levels of investment, especially \nin the public sector, have had an important impact on infrastructure development, economic \ntransformation and implementation of national poverty reduction programs. Concerns persist \nabout the quality of investments, in the sense that more growth and poverty reduction could \nhave been attained from the same level of investment.  \n \n12.  Strong economic growth was accompanied by strong growth in government revenues. \nTable A2.3 below illustrates the fiscal trend. In nominal terms, government revenue and grants \nincreased by an average of over 14% per year between 1999 and 2006. Revenue and grants \nrose from around 20% of GDP in 2000 to over 28% in 2006. Revenues from consumption of \npetroleum products and production of crude oil increased from 4.1% of GDP in 1998 to 6.5% in \n2003 and 8.6% in 2006, and account for the largest part of the revenue increase. The share of \nsuch revenues as a percentage of total revenue and grants rose from 20% in 1998 to 22.4% in \n2003 and 30% in 2006. As a consequence, the public budget has become more vulnerable to oil \nprice shocks. Although the oil production outlook for the years ahead appears to be quite robust, \ncrude oil exports cannot be relied upon as a source of revenues in the very long term. \n \n \n ", "38  Appendix 2   \nTable A2.3: Overview of Fiscal Trends (1999\u20132006) \n(percentage of GDP) \n \nItem  1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004  2005  2006\nTotal Revenue and \nGrants  19.6  20.5  21.4  22.7  23.1  26.6  25.9  28.0 \n  Tax revenue  15.1  14.8  15.7  16.8  16.7  19.3  23.5  26.0 \n  Grants    0.6    0.5    0.4    0.4    0.3    0.4    0.3    0.3 \n                 \nTotal Expenditure  21.2  22.6  24.2  24.1  25.1  29.9  28.3  31.3 \n  Current Expenditure  13.8  15.9  15.9  15.7  16.8  15.0  18.4  19.3 \n  Capital Expenditure    7.4    6.7    8.3    8.4    8.3    9.2    8.5    9.1 \nDeficit    (1.6)   (2.0)   (2.8)   (1.4)   (2.0)   (1.1)    (1.6)    (1.8)\n         ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \n         Source: Ministry of Finance. \n \n13.  To strengthen revenues as well as to encourage domestic and foreign investment, the \nGovernment has lightened the tax burden through reduction of tax rates in many areas. The \nenterprise income tax rate has been reduced from 32% to 28%, and the number of VAT tax \nrates has been cut from 4 to 3, with the highest rate (of 20%) abolished. The National Assembly \nhas decided to eliminate overseas profit remittance tax and surtax on enterprise income. Most \nnotably, in 2002, the agricultural land use tax was reduced by 50%; nearly all farmers have \nbeen exempted from such taxes since 2003, meaning that approximately 75% of Viet Nam\u2019s \npopulation now pays no direct taxes.  \n \n14.  The Government developed a strategy for reform of the tax system to the year 2010. \nThe strategy includes revision of current tax policies and reform of the tax administration \nsystem. Indirect tax revenues currently account for a substantial share (41%) of overall tax \ncollections, and this is expected to increase to 56% in 2010. Direct tax revenues, which account  \nfor 21% of total revenues, would increase to 24% given the government\u2019s continued policy on \ninvestment incentives. Various fees are to be rationalized. With regards to tax administration, \ntax self assessment will be further expanded, with the General Department of Taxation adopting \na functionally-based organizational structure focusing on taxpayer education and service, tax \naudit and inspection, and computerization of tax administration.  \n \n15.  1999 marked a turning point in the size of overall government spending. After steadily \ndeclining as a ratio of GDP in the preceding years, government spending (excluding onlending, \ncarry-over, and expenditure from retained revenue) has recovered during the period 1999\u2013\n2006. From a low of 21% of GDP in 1999, it reached 24.1% in 2002, 28% in 2005, and had \nincreased to over 31% in 2006. Between 1999 and 2006, total government spending rose at the \nremarkable  average  annual  rate  of  16  percent  in  nominal  terms,  with  capital  expenditure \ngrowing at some 20%. As a share of GDP, current expenditure rose from 13.8% in 1999 to \n19.3% in 2006, while capital expenditure rose from 5.7% to 9.1% over the same period. Capital \nexpenditure has averaged 30% of total expenditure over the last three years. \n \n16.  The net result of these revenue and expenditure trends has been a budget deficit that \nhas remained manageable, ranging between 1.1% and 2.8% over the period 1999\u20132006. The \nNational Assembly has been prudent in stipulating that the budget deficit plus amortization \nshould not  exceed 5% of GDP. The revenues collected by  the government fully  financed ", "Appendix 2  39 \nrecurrent expenditure and partly financed capital expenditure. Thus, borrowing was undertaken \nonly to finance, and was always less than, capital expenditure.  \n \n17.  By the end of 2006, the government debt that is attributable to budgetary expenditures, \nincluding ODA onlending, stands at around 37% of GDP. However, to get a more complete \npicture of the wider public debt position it is important to add items that are currently not \nreflected in the budget. Two such items are bonds issued to finance certain infrastructure and \neducation projects and the recapitalization costs of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). \nTheir inclusion in public debt numbers is likely to raise its level by about 3 percentage points. \nThis is by no means an alarming level, but it would be prudent to be watchful of these trends. \n \n2.  Fiscal Transparency \n \n18.  Fiscal  transparency  plays  an  important  role  in  ensuring  fiscal  sustainability.  Fiscal \ntransparency enables accountability to citizens regarding the use of government finances and \nthe  quality  of  fiscal  management,  and  facilitates  the  monitoring  conducted  by  government \nagencies, social organizations and grassroot communities of the allocation and spending of \npublic  resources  by  national  and  subnational  governments.  As  well  as  encouraging \nsustainability, this can enhance the effectiveness of public financial management. \n \n19.  Viet Nam has made continuous efforts since 1997 to enhance fiscal transparency and \npublicity. These efforts have followed two tracks. The first is announcement of policies regarding \nallocation norms, expenditure norms, fiscal assignments and monitoring arrangements. The \nsecond is the publication and dissemination of figures, data and materials relating to annual \nbudget planning and final accounts of the state budget at all levels of government and at \nspending unit level.  \n \n20.  In 1998 the budget revenue and expenditure figures were published in the General \nStatistics Office\u2019s Statistical Yearbook for the first time. In the same year, Viet Nam\u2019s State \nBudget revenues and expenditures were published in the IMF\u2019s Government Finance Statistics \nYearbook, also for the first time. Decision 192 on Fiscal Transparency was issued by the Prime \nMinister in 2004, specifying the rules of fiscal transparency and publication. The requirements \nfor disclosure have been substantially increased. In particular, allocation norms approved by the \nNational  Assembly  and  the  people\u2019s  councils  must  be  publicized  at  each  budget  level. \nOrganizations funded from the state budget must disclose their state budget support, budget \nplans and final accounts, and the methods used to determine their state budget support. For \nstate capital investment projects, annual budget allocations, budget plans, final accounts and \nbidding results for procurements must be disclosed. \n \n3.  Pro-Poor Public Expenditures \n \n21.  Viet Nam is committed to a strategy of poverty reduction. Astonishing progress has been \nmade. Over the period 1993\u20132002, the proportion of people below the poverty line has fallen \nfrom 58% to 29%, and the Government estimates that the proportion fell to 26% in 2004. Thus, \nViet Nam has lifted approximately 25 million people out of poverty in less than a decade. Public \nexpenditure allocation has played an important role in this achievement.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 2   \nTable A2.4: Budget for National Targeted Programs  \n(D billion) \n \nNational Targeted Program  2004  2005  2006 \nPoverty Reduction and Employment Creation  782 818  925 \nP\nSafe Water and Sanitation in Rural Areas  255 300  353 \nPopulation and Family Planning Program  440 450  572 \nDangerous Social Diseases and HIV/AIDS   508 685  910 \nPrevention Program \nCultural Program  232 320  370 \nEducation and Training Program  1,299 1,770  2,970 \nProgram 135 (Infrastructure Development in Difficult  1,366 1,625  1,816 \nCommunes) \nFive Million Hectare Afforestation Program  476 550  610 \nTotal  5,358 6,518  8,526 \n              Source: Ministry of Finance. \n \n22.  Assessing the extent to which public spending is resulting in a transfer of resources \ntowards poor households requires consideration of both the composition of public expenditure \nand the effectiveness of public spending within each sector. It is clear, however, that pro-poor \nbudget allocations are an important step towards pro-poor service delivery. The Government \nhas three important tools for public spending and poverty reduction allocation. The first is \nbudget transfers, with statistics showing that poor provinces generally received substantial net \ntransfers per capita from the central level. The second is the allocation of state investment, with \nevidence indicating that investment-related resources are skewed toward the richest programs. \nIt can be argued that capital expenditures are more \u201cpro-growth\u201d, and that in the long term, the \nresulting economic growth will benefit the poor. The third are National Target Programs. The \nbudget for targeted programs increased at an average rate of 25% over the last three years, \nhigher than the 16% growth in total expenditure, reflecting the fact that more resources have \nbeen allocated for pro-poor programs.  \n \n4.  Towards PRSC 7 \n \n23.  Looking forward, the World Bank and PRSC stakeholders have considered several key \nreform policies for PRSC 7 in support of the Government\u2019s implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. \nThese key policies are distilled from SEDP 2006\u20132010, the joint-donor annual analytical report, \nVDR 2007, and continuing policy dialogue during the loan fact-finding (upgraded to appraisal) \nmission.  These  key  or  priority  policies,  referred  as  triggers  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  program \ndocument, are not binding conditions, but rather serve as a guide to focus the policy dialogue \ntowards PRSC 7.  \n \n24.  The key policies that  PRSC stakeholders will focus on in the coming year include \npolicies related to early warning mechanisms to address impacts of World Trade Organization \naccession; the lending policy of economic groups; participation of strategic partners in the ", "Appendix 2  41 \nequitization of SOCBs;  cost norms systems in the civil works market; tuition fees at secondary \nand tertiary levels; health insurance premiums; voluntary pension program for farmers and \ninformal sector; guidelines for the Gender Equality Law; forest development; integrated river \nbasin management and the national sanitation strategy; criteria for selecting public investment \nprojects; disclosure of State Audit of Viet Nam reports; and asset declaration by senior officials.  \n \n25.  The World Bank will assess progress on these key policies towards the end of 2007 in \norder to launch formal preparation for PRSC 7. Given that these key policies spread across all \nfour pillars of the program, uneven progress may be expected. As a result, such assessment will \nbe holistic, recognizing that some triggers may not be fully met, while the expected targets may \nbe exceeded in other areas.  \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND LETTER OF ASSESSMENT 1 \n \n1.       Vietnam\u2019s economic performance has remained strong during the first few months of \n2007.  Exports  have  continued  to  grow  briskly,  investment  and  consumption  growth  have \nremained strong, and industrial production has continued to expand at double-digit rates. With \nmarket sentiment bolstered by Vietnam\u2019s much-awaited accession to the WTO on January 11, \nforeign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio capital inflows have been particularly buoyant, and \nthe overall balance of payments has recorded a sizable surplus. \n2.       Growing access to foreign markets and capital has created new opportunities for cost-\neffective  financing  of  Vietnam\u2019s  large  investment  requirements,  but  has  also  created  new \nchallenges. The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Market Price Index rose by 144.5 percent in 2006, and \nby another 50 percent in the first two months of 2007, before retreating somewhat in recent \nmonths. With the number of listed companies rising from 41 at end-2005 to nearly 200, the \nmarket\u2019s total capitalization soared from less that VND 10 trillion (1.2 percent of GDP) at end-\n2005 to VND 320 trillion (28 \u00bd percent of GDP) as of mid-May 2007. This unprecedented boom \nin stock prices has reduced the cost of capital for firms, boosted the wealth and consumption of \ndomestic investors, and increased Vietnam\u2019s appeal to foreign investors. At the same time, \nhowever, the need to contain the attendant risks to the financial system has heightened the \nurgency  of  policy  measures  to  protect  macroeconomic  stability,  enhance  financial  system \nsurveillance, and improve the governance of state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and state-\nowned enterprises (SOE). \n(i)  Short-Term Outlook and Risks \n3.       The prospects for 2007 remain broadly favorable. GDP is projected to continue to expand \nat an annual rate of around 8 percent, led by sustained export and investment growth. While a \npick-up in imports is projected to shift the trade balance back into a deficit, this is likely to be \nmore than financed by continued strong receipts from remittances and capital inflows.  \n4.       However, the outlook is not without risks. Inflation remains stubbornly high, with the \ntwelve-month rate estimated to have risen back above 7 percent since April 2007. Welcome \nadjustments in electricity and petroleum prices, together with a resurfacing of food supply \nshocks, have contributed to the recent uptick in prices. However, large increases in the prices of \nmajor nonfood items also seem to point to growing demand pressures, which may become more \ndifficult to contain as growing capital inflows complicate monetary management. The risk of \nrising inflation could be heightened if a large positive fiscal impulse were to further add to the \ndemand pressures in 2007.  \n                                                 \n1 Per ADB\u2019s request, on 8 August 2007 the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) provided this statement, which updates the IMF staff\u2019s assessment of Viet Nam\u2019s current \neconomic situation provided to the Consultative Group (CG) Meeting held in Hanoi on 14-15 December \n2006. The IMF noted that this letter is identical to the IMF staff statement presented at the midterm CG \nmeeting in Halong on 1 June 2007, and has also been used by the World Bank for the PRSC operation \nconsidered by the World Bank's Board of Directors on 21 June 2007. \n ", "Appendix 3  43 \n5.       Over the medium term, a slowdown in the global economy or a tightening of global \nliquidity conditions could expose vulnerabilities in the balance sheets of financial institutions and \nlarge  SOEs,  which  may have  made  sub-optimal  investment  decisions  during  the  period of \nbooming  demand.  The  resulting  contingent  government  liabilities,  together  with  continued \nreliance on the state sector to finance the bulk of the country\u2019s huge infrastructure needs, could \neventually threaten debt sustainability. \n(ii) Fiscal Policy and Reforms   \n6.       The risk of inflation and the need to protect medium-term debt sustainability call for a \nmore cautious fiscal stance. The estimated fiscal deficit recorded a welcome decrease in 2006, \nbut the 2007 Budget appears to be set on an expansionary course. Current expenditure is to be \nboosted by a sharp increase in social expenditures in 2007, after having been fueled largely by \nincreasing wages and oil subsidies in 2005\u201306. While a large oil revenue windfall helped to \ncontain the overall deficit (based on the Fund\u2019s definition, which includes on-lending through the \nVietnam Development Bank (VDB) and off-budget investment) to less than 4 percent of GDP in \n2006,  full  implementation  of  the  investment  plans  envisaged  in  the  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Program (SEDP) for 2006\u20132010 could raise the deficit to 7 percent of GDP in \n2007. The non-oil deficit would rise from 13\u00bd percent of GDP in 2006 to 15\u00bd percent of GDP \nin 2007, while the public debt stock would rise from about 44 percent of GDP at end-2006 to \naround 46 percent of GDP by end-2007. While the concessional terms on most external debt, \nwhich still accounts for more than half of total public debt, would help keep the debt service \nburden manageable, growing recourse to market-based financing through the capital markets \ncould make the fiscal position more vulnerable to changes in market sentiment. \n7.       Given the projected leveling off of oil receipts, the containment of the fiscal deficit will \nrequire a concerted effort to boost non-oil revenues and curb expenditure growth. The reduction \nin import tariff rates associated with WTO accession, and the constraints posed by planned tax \nreforms, call for an accelerated effort to improve tax administration. On the expenditure side, we \nwelcome the recent progress toward adjusting domestic oil prices, and support the authorities\u2019 \ndecision to remove remaining controls over oil prices by the end of 2008. To curb pressures on \nthe government\u2019s wage bill and slow the growth of its pension liabilities, we encourage the \nauthorities to discontinue the indexation of public wages and pensions to the common minimum \nwage, and adopt instead a more differentiated and merit-based structure of salary increases in the \ncontext of civil service reform. Slowing the growth of public investment is likely to be a \nchallenge, given the urgent need to ease the country\u2019s serious infrastructure bottlenecks. To \nensure  continued  development  of  essential  public  infrastructure,  more  proactive  steps  to \nencourage private participation could be considered. Projects still funded through the issuance of \ninvestment bonds or on-lending should be subject to rigorous screening and monitoring, and the \ncredit appraisal and risk management capacities of the Vietnam Development Bank (VDB) \nstrengthened. Effective enforcement of the new laws to curb corruption and prevent the waste of \npublic funds would need to be an integral part of this effort. \n(iii) Monetary Policy and Exchange System Reform \n8.       A more restrained monetary policy will likely be required to contain inflation, and limit \nthe potential expansion of nonperforming loans (NPLs). Credit growth has showed signs of \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nreacceleration in recent months, with the rate of growth of credit to the economy rising from 23 \npercent in the year to September 2006 to about 29 percent in the year to February 2007. While \nthe authorities\u2019 monetary program for 2007 envisages a slowing of credit growth to 20 percent \nby year-end, the achievement of this objective is threatened by ample excess bank liquidity. The \nauthorities\u2019 recent efforts to introduce prudential restraints on commercial bank lending for stock \nmarket purchases are welcome steps, which should help reduce banks\u2019 exposure to stock market \nrisks and guard against a potentially costly boom-bust cycle in stock prices. The authorities also \nneed to take more pro-active measures to mop up excess liquidity, including by allowing the \nState Bank of Vietnam (SBV) to exercise adequate autonomy in the issuance of SBV bills.  \n9.       Vietnam\u2019s  rapid  integration  into  the  global  economy  calls  for  continued  efforts  to \nincrease exchange rate flexibility. The authorities have recently taken welcome steps in this \ndirection. In January 2007, the trading band of the dong vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar was widened \nfrom +/-0.25 percent to +/-0.5 percent around the daily reference rate set by the SBV, and the \ndong temporarily appreciated as the pace of inflows peaked in January-February 2007. In the \nface  of  continuing  large  foreign  exchange  inflows,  further  steps  to  increase  exchange  rate \nflexibility would serve to stem inflationary pressures while decreasing the need for sterilization. \nA more flexible exchange rate policy could also mitigate the potential disruptive effects of a \npossible future reversal of capital inflows by encouraging economic agents to better hedge \nexchange rate risks and allowing the exchange rate to play a greater role as a shock absorber.   \n \nBank Reform and Financial Sector Supervision \n \n10.      Bank reform remains key to improving the allocation of saving and investment and \nprotecting financial stability. The growing possibilities for financing through the capital market, \nincreasing competition from joint-stock banks, and the new regime of liberal entry of fully \nforeign-owned  banks,  have  increased  the  urgency  of  SOCB  reform.  In  this  context,  the \ngovernment\u2019s renewed commitment to proceed with the equitization of the main SOCBs is \nwelcome,  as  is  the  recent  increase  in  the  ceiling  for  participation  by  individual  strategic \ninvestors. We also welcome the recent adoption of an SOCB recapitalization plan, and look \nforward to the upcoming publication of financial reports of the SOCBs based on International \nAccounting Standards. These steps need to be backed by timely action to improve the corporate \ngovernance of SOCBs, including by providing their managers with adequate autonomy to make \nlending decisions based on purely commercial criteria.  \n  \n11.      The growing scope for securities market operations and portfolio capital movements also \ncalls  for  further  steps  to  strengthen  prudential  regulation  of  bank  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions. We support the authorities\u2019 medium-term plans to convert the SBV into a modern \ncentral bank, and to grant it adequate authority and independence to carry out an anti-inflationary \nmonetary policy and effective financial sector supervision. In the meantime, it is important that \nthe SBV, the State Securities Commission (SSC), and the Ministry of Finance improve the \ntracking of vulnerabilities associated with stock market-related risks and capital movements. \nGiven the risks posed by related transactions among banks, their securities company affiliates, \nand the buyers or issuers of securities, a concerted effort is required to regulate stock market-\nrelated credit and discourage insider trading. Controls also need to be put in place to prohibit \nrelated-party transactions within economic groups involved in a mix of industrial operations and \nfinancial services. ", "Appendix 3  45 \n \nState-Owned Enterprise Reform and Private Sector Development \n \n12.      The authorities\u2019 plans to restructure and equitize SOEs are welcome. However, it will \nalso be important that SOE managers be granted clear incentives and full autonomy to make their \nown  pricing  and  investment  decisions  on  commercial  principles,  and  the  entry  of  foreign \nstrategic  investors  should  be  encouraged  to  facilitate  the  needed  improvement  in  SOE \ngovernance. The mandates of economic groups of wholly state-owned enterprises, and their \nrelations with government, should be clearly defined, and regulatory safeguards established, \nwhere needed, to ensure that their market power will not be used to undermine competition. \n \n13.      A more transparent and market-friendly legal and regulatory framework would be key to \nenabling Vietnam to capitalize on its growing appeal to foreign investors. We welcome plans to \nalign energy prices with world market conditions, and urge the authorities to also remove other \nremaining price controls that discourage private investment. To further level the playing field, \nsimplify rules and regulations, and improve the business climate, we encourage the authorities to \nswiftly adopt pending legislation and associated implementing decrees and circulars in full \nconformity with Vietnam\u2019s WTO commitments. \n \n14.      The quality, timeliness, and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics and Financial \nStability Indicators will also need to be improved to support informed policy decisions and build \nenduring investor confidence. In this regard, we support the authorities\u2019 ongoing efforts to \ndevelop better measures of core inflation and look forward to the issuance of the government\u2019s \nfirst semi-annual Debt Bulletin. More transparent accounting, reporting, and monitoring of the \ngovernment\u2019s extra-budgetary operations and all publicly-funded projects would also be helpful \nin reassuring donors that their assistance is being put to the best use. \n \nConcluding Remarks \n \n15.      Vietnam\u2019s historic accession to the WTO attests to its impressive economic progress \nsince the launching of the policy of Doi Moi some twenty years ago. In the coming years, \ndeepening economic and financial integration should facilitate achievement of the government\u2019s \nambitious objectives to lift Vietnam from the ranks of low-income countries by 2010 and join the \nranks of industrial countries by 2020. However, growing exposure to global markets has made it \nall the more important that macroeconomic policies be kept on a sound footing and the pace of \nmarket-oriented reforms accelerated. We have no doubt that, with the continued good judgment \nof its leadership, Vietnam will successfully meet these challenges, and we wish the authorities \nevery success in these endeavors. \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nPOLICY MATRIX AND COMPLIANCE STATUS \n \nTable A4.1:  Policy Matrix \n \nSector  Policy Actions  \nPillar I: Business Development \nGlobal  1.

This period has also seen considerable progress in social indicators, with Viet \nNam  now  being  on  a  solid  track  to  attain  or  exceed  most  if  not  all  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Over these five years, considerable progress was made in public financial \nmanagement, public administration reform and the strengthening of governance more broadly. \n \nThese successes reflect the reform drive of our government, as expresses among others in the \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). The CPRGS, which was \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank and many other donors, jointly with other plans and \nstrategic documents of our government, served as the basis for a continuous policy dialogue \nacross a range of policy areas. PRSC operations provided an effective platform to conduct such \ndialogue, refine the content and articulation of policy reforms and channel resources to our \nbudget to finance their implementation. The usefulness of this approach is confirmed by the \nincreasingly  large  number  of  donors  participating  in  PRSCs.  The  commitment  of  our \ngovernment to the process is reflected in the timely completion of the annual operations in the \ncycles. \n \nBuilding on the successes of economic reforms over the previous five years, Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006-2010 was approved by the National Assembly on \nJune 29 2006. In October 2006, the Board of Executive Directors of the Asian Development \nBank approved the Country Strategy and Program 2007-2010 based on the approved SEDP \n2006-2010. \n \nA key goal of the SEDP is to sustain rapid economic growth so that Viet Nam can move out of \nlow income status by 2010 and lay the foundations to become an industrial country by 2020. \nThe SEDP affirms that rapid growth should go hand in hand with improved sustainability, and \nimproved quality and  competitiveness of  the economy.  Importance is attached to in-depth \ndevelopment while wider development should not be forgotten. Economic growth should be \n ", "58  Appendix 7 \nlinked  with  poverty  reduction,  cultural  development,  comprehensive  human  development, \nexercise of democracy and social equity. The SEDP also aims to narrow the development gaps \namong regions, step by step, while preserving and improving the environment. We would like to \ndraw your attention to the Chapter IV of the SEDP which provides the Development Orientation \nof various sectors over the period 2006-2010. \n \nOverall, the objectives, tasks and solutions of the SEDP can be mapped on to three pillars (a) \nbusiness development (b) natural resources and the environment and (c) social equity. Chapter \nIV highlights the goals, tasks, and solutions for achieving agricultural development, industrial \nmodernization, and services sector growth. Chapter VII of the SEDP identifies the roles of \nvarious sectors in business development, including the role of the private sector as a driving \nforce. We aim to create favorable conditions for the development of the private sector without \nlimiting its scales, fields or regions. Chapter IV.B details the goals, tasks, and solutions for the \nsocial sectors, while Chapter IV.C identifies goals and policies for the sustainable development \nof natural resources and protection of the environment. \n \nIn order to achieve the objectives of economic growth, business development, environment \nsustainability and social equity we need to improve the institutional framework of the socialist \noriented  market  economy  in  a  comprehensive  manner.  The  measures  to  this  effect  are \nespecially highlighted in Chapter IX. The chapter emphasizes legal reforms for supporting a \nmarket  economy,  the  importance  of  improving  the  quality  of  public  administration,  and \nstrengthening the fight against corruption. \n \nThe government\u2019s resolution No. 3/22006/NQ-CP identifies the tasks of various ministries and \nagencies for implementing the SEDP and the state budget during this year. This resolution \naffirms our commitment to successfully achieving the targets identified in the SEDP. \n \nThe tasks listed in this resolution bear a close resemblance with the policy actions and triggers \nidentified in the proposed credit. Jointly with the following operations in the series, the proposed \nseries effectively supports the implementation of the reform agenda outlined in the SEDP. The \nproposed credit also contributes to harmonization, in the spirit of the Hanoi Core Statement of \nAid  Effectiveness.  Our  government  appreciates  the  technical  inputs  provided  through  this \nprocess, as well as the resources to implement policy reforms and the reduced transaction \ncosts in conducting the policy dialogue with the donor community.  \n \nOur government therefore requests the Association\u2019s assistance through this sixth PRSC, in \nrecognition for the progress made in the implementation of our development strategy. We \nrecognize that many difficult challenges lie ahead, but we are confident that we will be able to \novercome them. We hope that we will count on the support of the Association during this five-\nyear  cycle,  as  we  make  progress  to  implement  the  reform  program,  with  the  ambition  of \nbecoming a middle-income country by the end of the decade. \n \nWe look forward to your continued support. \n \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \nNguyen Van Giau \nGovernor  \nState Bank of Viet Nam ", "Appendix 8  59           \nSUMMARY POVERTY STRATEGY AND ASSESSMENT \n \nTable A8.1:  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \n \nThe program loan will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting implementation of the Government\u2019s 5-year \nsocioeconomic development plan (SEDP), covering 2006\u20132010. The program loan in the form of a poverty reduction \nsupport credit (PRSC) is a multisector instrument covering a range of issues in a broad-based reform agenda related \nto poverty reduction through four main reform areas: (i) business development, (ii) social inclusion, (iii) natural \nresources, and (iii) modern governance. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 clearly spells out the Government\u2019s priorities. It \ncontains a long list of policy actions to be adopted in a 5-year cycle through support by PRSCs 6\u201310. The SEDP is \nregarded as the national poverty reduction strategy, which aims to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery \nand other social indicators in a sustainable, equitable, and cost-effective manner. The program loan, which follows the \nPRSC 6 policy framework, calls for further acceleration of policy changes and reforms that (i) increase efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability; and (ii) stimulate growth, thereby reducing poverty and improving social services to \npoor people. The SEDP and the program loan are thus consistent with the poverty reduction strategy, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for Viet Nam 2007\u20132010,1 and the attainment of the Viet Nam \nDevelopment Goals (the country\u2019s version of the Millennium Development Goals). \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe SEDP 2006\u20132010 presents a comprehensive  analysis of poverty in Viet Nam. The text includes candid \ndiscussions and reflects wide stakeholder consultation regarding disadvantaged groups. A comprehensive poverty \nupdate was also carried out by the Vietnamese Academy on Social Sciences2 in early 2007, based on the household \nsurvey of 2004. ADB, jointly with other academic and government institutions, also carried out analysis regarding \npoverty as background to the preparation of PRSC 6.3  ADB also prepared the country poverty assessment to provide \nanalytical inputs to the preparation of PRSC 6 and the country strategy and program 2007\u20132010. The Government \nhas allowed for the collection of more reliable data through biannual household surveys, building on the already-\nimproved 2004 survey quality. Monitoring of progress towards development outcomes cannot be conducted on an \nannual basis, however. \n \nThe comprehensive Viet Nam Development Report 2007, Aiming High, preparation of which began shortly after \napproval of the SEDP by the National Assembly, was co-signed by 16 donors, and provides the main analytical \nunderpinning for the new PRSC cycles. A background, independent evaluation of the first series of PRSCs was also \ncommissioned as part of the report.     \nViet Nam\u2019s economic performance over the last 5 years has been strong, particularly in relation to poverty reduction. \nProgress in poverty reduction has been slower for Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic minorities, among whom the poverty incidence \nreached 61% in 2004, compared to 14% for the majority Kinh-Hoa group. The main perceived causes of poverty are (i) \npoor infrastructure; (ii) poor factor markets; (iii) ineffectiveness of Government policies and programs at the grassroots \nlevel; (iv) lack of transparency and accountability; (v) lack of participation by people in decision making; (vi) weak \ncapacity of local government staff: (vii) lack of land, capital and labor; (viii) poor health; and (ix) harsh climatic \nconditions.  Challenges  remain  regarding  (i) the quality of growth,  (ii) participation of the poor in the growth process, \n(iii) insurance  and  the  social  protection  system,   (iv)  poverty  reduction  for  ethnic  minorities  in  lagging regions,   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Thus, a careful approach (in terms of planning, delivery \nand transfers) will be required. This is reflected in the implementation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010. With a sound and \nsustainable strategy at hand, the challenge now lies in implementation.  \n \nThe Government is aware of the challenges it faces, and prepared an explicit section on ethnic support in the SEDP \n2006\u20132010. The Government also has preferential and special programs for the poor and special programs for ethnic \npeople in these regions, e.g., the comprehensive Hunger Eradication and Poverty Reduction Program 2006-2010 and \nother targeted programs, such as Program 135, which are in place and have generally benefited the poor. Features \nthat will increase the effectiveness of the two programs designed for 2006\u20132010 include further decentralization, a \nfocus on capacity building, and participation by affected people in planning, monitoring and evaluation.  \nB.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nPRSCs retain good policy lending practices with stakeholder engagement. Policy dialogues between donors and the \nGovernment are broad in nature, encompassing all major policy areas. The Government took strong ownership in \nseeking the views and perspectives of other related line ministries and development partners, and the civil society, \nwith respect to the lessons from, advantages of and challenges for the PRSCs.4 The PRSCs are found to be relevant \nin that they align with objectives of SEDP 2006\u20132010. The Government and development partners both support the \nongoing  government  reforms,  while  stakeholders\u2019  perspectives  have  been  well  captured  in  the  policy  action \nnegotiation process for PRSC 6.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes      No \n \nFormulation of the SEDP and PRSCs (and thus the program loan) involved comprehensive consultations and \ndiscussions with a wide range of stakeholders. The process leading to the preparation of the SEDP 2006\u20132010 had \nimportant strengths compared to preceding processes. There was a serious effort to collect inputs from different \ngroups of the Vietnamese society. In addition to internal discussions within government, consultation workshops were \nheld with local officials, groups of academics, the domestic business sector, international and local nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), people living with disabilities (PWD), overseas Vietnamese, women and women\u2019s groups, and \ndonors. A series of participatory research exercises involving local experts and international NGOs also helped to \ngather feedback from poor communities in 17 sites across the country. The draft SEDP was declassified for the first \ntime ever, and was discussed by the National Assembly in November 2005, a departure from previous practice that \nscheduled National Assembly discussions after the Party Congress. The SEDP 2006\u20132010 is also accompanied by a \nresults framework based on stakeholder consultations.   \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe SEDP and PRSC 6 support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality through \npolicies and actions that will require gender-sensitive implementation of the program loan. The National Assembly \npassed the Law on Gender Equality in November 2006, which relates to equal rights for women in labor, employment, \neducation, and health care. Increases in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and in \nall sectors and strengthening of the mechanisms for the advancement of women are also required. The new law \nunifies a legal framework to address gender disparities and increase women\u2019s participation in decision making. The \nGovernment has signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) \nand successfully presented its fourth and fifth report to the CEDAW committee in January 2007. The National \nCommittee for the Advancement of Women comprises 18 members at the deputy-minister level from key ministries \nand central organizations. The national strategy for the advancement of women in Viet Nam approved the Third Action \nPlan For Womens Advancement to 2010.  While gender equality indicators are better in Viet Nam than in many other \ndeveloping countries, steps are being taken to narrow the remaining gaps. \n \nHas an output been prepared?     Yes     No \nA social and poverty impact assessment of the program loan was prepared and finalized in February 2006 for the \npreceding loan to cofinance PRSC 5. The assessment includes an assessment on gender, as well as the impact of the \nprogram loan on gender development. From the assessment, the overall impact on gender is expected to be positive. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme and some other development \npartners are supporting the Government in developing \nclearer  guidelines  that  increase  the  Government\u2019s \ncapacity at all levels to better undertake these targeted \nprograms.  Development  partners  have  coordinated  as \nenvisaged in the Hanoi Core Statement (June 2005) to \ndevelop  a  plan  to  ensure  readiness  and  synergy  of \nnumerous projects supporting the Government\u2019s targeted \nprograms. \n     \nThe problems of labor redundancy in rural areas and lack \n   Significant   Yes \nof  off-farm  work  are  slowly  being  resolved  through \nLabor     \neconomic restructuring.

Negative labor impacts will be minimized by \nsome government measures, such as the creation of an \nenvironment conducive to and market for labor export, \npromotion of vocational training, and development of a \nviable voluntary social insurance system. The labor code \nwas revised in early 2007. Although the Social Insurance \nLaw was passed in 2006, the unemployment insurance \nprogram will not be formally launched until 2010.   \n \nAlthough  the  record  on  poverty  reduction  has  been \n   Significant   Yes \nimpressive, a potential risk exists in the medium- to long- \nIndigenous     \nterm for increased disparities between the majority Kinh \nPeoples    Not significant  and ethnic minorities.

The Government \nis committed to (i) advancing the well-being of indigenous \npeople,  (ii)  increasing  public  awareness,  and  (iii) \nincorporating the needs and interests of ethnic minorities \nin plans and programs through their active involvement; \nall  of  these  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998).  \nThere  is  a  risk  that  restructuring  could  lead  to \nencroachment  on  forest  land  by  outsiders,  to  the \ndetriment of the local population, especially indigenous \nand ethnic minorities. The Government addressed the risk \nrelated to the restructuring of state forestry enterprises \n(SFE)  by  issuing  the  National  Forest  Development \nStrategy, which strengthens linkages between protective \nand  economic  functions  of  forests,  and  promotes \nownership by local households  and  communities. The \nstrategy  addresses  revisions  to  the  5  million  hectare \nForest Plan, and aims to improve the balance between \nforest protection, multi-purpose forestation and policies to \nencourage farmers to live with the forests.  \nBased on the Grassroots Democracy Ordinance, issued in \n2007, effective grassroots democracy requires increased \nparticipation by ethnic people. Public administrative reform \nis resulting in the training and retraining of local groups of \nethnic minorities, while other programs in education and \nhealth  address  access  to  social  services  by  ethnic \nminorities. Through the country\u2019s decentralization policy \nand  promotion  of  grassroots  democracy,  indigenous \npeoples  can  better  influence  spending  decisions  for \nallocated funds and ensure these meet their needs.   \nOther Risks   Significant  The Government is responding to the evolving HIV/AIDS   Yes \nand/or    epidemic.

Under PRSC 6 the most important priority actions in relation to global \nintegration were the granting of trading and distribution rights to all foreign firms in line with international commitments \nand issuance of regulations to guide the intellectual property law, with enforcement mechanisms. SOE reform was \naccelerated by divestiture of SOEs and SOCBs, through established use of share auctions and a sound mechanism of \nequitization allowing participation by foreign strategic investors. Banking reform is ongoing, with (i) the introduction of \nprivate capital in SOCBs, (ii) elimination of non-commercial objectives as a consideration in lending decisions, and (iii) \nrequirements that financial statements be disclosed in line with international standards. Private sector growth will  \nimprove with removal of administrative barriers and reform of the business registration process. The increase in \nefficiency of public resource in providing infrastructure coupled with the increase in volume of private funding in \ninfrastructure enable for businesses to continue to grow and generate sustainable economic growth.  \nSecond, it will (i) reduce poverty and ensure social inclusion through an expanded budget appropriation; (ii) establish \nquality standards for education; (iii)  provide resources to cover the health care costs of the poor; (iv) establish \nmechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, and (v) protect property and resources,  \nespecially in upland and ethnic minority areas. The pension program was improved but will still need to implement the \nSocial Insurance Law to (i) cover informal sector workers and farmers under a voluntary pension program, and (ii) \nincrease the financial viability of the system. The Law on Gender Equality needs to be put into practice, with clear \nguidelines and enforcement capacities. \nThird, it will address the management of the environment and natural resources in a sustainable manner. Rapid \nurbanization and infrastructure growth require  improvements in land management  and proper  urban  planning. \nMeasures to improve environmental and water resources management will also be required through compulsory \nparticipatory environment impact assessments for large projects.  \nFourth, it will build institutions that can support the SEDP implementation through increased transparency and \naccountability of public finances, promotion of simplified administrative procedures, reduction of corruption, and \nrevamping of planning processes as part of a broader effort to build modern governance.  \nViet Nam\u2019s economic performance was remarkable over the last five years. Poverty reduction has been more rapid \nthan in other countries in the region, although progress in poverty reduction has been slower for Viet Nam\u2019s ethnic \nminorities. Inadequate progress on enhancing budget transparency and tackling corruption is associated with fiduciary \nrisk. At the same time, fast integration with the world economy may lead to increased inequality, at least temporarily, \nas the benefits accrue to specific regions. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in the years to come. \nPRSC is a vehicle for the Asian Development Bank to work together and more broadly with other members of the \nofficial development assistance community, in delivering economic growth and poverty reduction. Active engagement \nwill strengthen the coherence of the program, especially in providing an exceptional window for high-level policy \naccess, and not just as an aid instrument. The reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which \nwill lead to additional job creation. Further decentralization of public administration, leading to better service delivery to \nthe poor and increased local beneficiary participation, are other expected benefits.  \nStrong direct and indirect benefits are expected to reach the poor through improved service delivery, decentralized \nplanning, and promotion of beneficiary participation. The Government has implemented several special programs and \npolicies to (i) ensure the poor have access to jobs, basic health services, education, and infrastructure, especially in \nthe mountainous regions and in poor urban areas; and (ii) enhance the well-being of ethnic minorities. Decentralization \nshould make  local government more accountable to the poorest for their participation in decision making on \ndevelopment programs and delivery of services. Measures have been implemented to ensure participation by the poor \nin the planning and decision-making process, and efforts to increase their participation will have positive impacts that \ninclude (i) increased efficiency of small infrastructure planning in selected projects run by the Government or \nsupported by ODA funds; and (ii) enhanced ownership of the government through budget support, mobilization and \nincrease budget transparency as required by the Budget Law.  \n ", "68  Appendix 9             \nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n1.
