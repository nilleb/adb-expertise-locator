INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) to the Government of Cambodia aims to improve aid \neffectiveness through greater use of government systems for the management and utilization of \nits  portfolio  of  externally  financed  projects  and  programs.  Based  on  the  findings  and \nrecommendations  of  the  2012  country  portfolio  review  mission  (CPRM)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the 2012 Joint Country Portfolio Performance Review (JCPPR),1 and \nthe  government's  2011  Cambodia  Development  Effectiveness  Report, 2  the  government \nrequested ADB assistance in building its capacity to manage ADB-financed projects in particular \nand official development assistance in general. The TA concept paper was approved on 19 April \n2012. The scope, expected impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation arrangements were \ndiscussed and finalized during the TA fact-finding mission in April 2012.3  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Official development assistance contributes about 50% of the government's budget and \nis an important catalyst for Cambodia\u2019s rapid economic development; sustainable economic \ngrowth is projected at 7% annually during the implementation period of the National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan, 2009\u20132013. As one of Cambodia\u2019s largest development partners, ADB has \nprovided 78 public sector loans or grants for a total of $1.5 billion, and annual approvals of new \nprojects or programs planned for 2013\u20132014 amounting to about $130 million. The total current \nvolume of ADB\u2019s active loan and grant portfolio is $772.7 million, but the size of the portfolio is \nrapidly expanding and may reach $900 million in 2012. To ensure sustained economic growth, \nthe government will need to better manage its public investments, cut procurement delays, and \nimprove its business procedures. \n \n3.   The CPRM concluded that a substantial improvement of portfolio performance requires \nlong-term, well-structured capacity development of executing and implementing agencies in \nproject management, procurement, and financial management. The most suitable avenue to \npursue this is through the country's own systems of project management, financial management, \nand procurement for externally financed projects. These are enshrined and described in detail in \nthe  government's  standard  operating  procedure  (SOP)  for  processing,  implementing,  and \ncompleting projects. \n \n4.  Prior to 2005, the government did not have a coherent, consistent, and unified set of \noperating  procedures  to  manage  and  implement  externally  financed  projects.  With  the \nassistance of ADB, the government in 2005 developed and issued instructions to implement \n(i) a  SOP  manual  on  project  administration  to  increase  aid  effectiveness  and  improve \nmanagement  of  the  externally  assisted  portfolio;  (ii)  a  procurement  manual  to  improve \nprocurement performance of the portfolio; and (iii) a financial management manual (FMM) to \ndevelop  and  maintain  effective  and  efficient  financial  management  of  projects.  This \ndemonstrated the government\u2019s strong commitment to principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration \non Aid Effectiveness. The three manuals were promulgated under a Sub Decree on 22 May \n2012, making their use mandatory for all externally assisted projects and programs in Cambodia \nunder the purview of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).  \n \n                                                 \n1 Led by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and involving ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nand the World Bank. \n2  Royal Government of Cambodia. 2011. Cambodia Development Effectiveness Report. Phnom Penh. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 August 2012. \n ", "2   \n5.  While the use of the manuals was made mandatory, capacity building to ensure effective \nimplementation was not organized in any structured and sustainable manner. The JCPPR found \nthat the lack of institutionalized training was a major obstacle to providing regular training on \nprocurement and financial management, and improving portfolio performance. A JCPPR action \nplan  was  prepared  in  April  2012,  which  included  a  proposal  to  prepare  and  implement  a \nstructured capacity building program to improve aid utilization efficiency. \n \n6.  Since 2010, all JCPPR partners have supported MEF in updating the three manuals. \nADB provided extensive support using project grant resources managed by the Cambodia \nResident Mission and ADB's Southeast Asia Department.4 It is the government\u2019s intention to \nmandate the application of the manuals to all projects and programs financed by development \npartners starting in second-half of 2012. To ensure successful implementation, a well-structured \ncapacity development program for staff at executing and implementing agencies is needed. \n \n7.  While SOP and FMM describe the prevailing country systems on project administration \nand financial management (there are no other equivalent regulations), the regulations governing \nprocurement are more complex. The January 2012 Law on Public Procurement is guided by a \nSub Decree\u2014Internal Rules and Regulations governing Public Procurement (IRRPP)\u2014covering \ndomestically funded procurement. The law and the IRRPP are not yet officially translated into \nEnglish but the IRRPP appears to be closely aligned with the provisions in the procurement \nmanual, with only minor differences. This effectively means that there are two parallel country \nprocurement  systems  (one  for  domestic  procurement  and  one  for  projects  funded  by  the \ndevelopment partners). The law covers both systems and specifies that externally financed \nprojects can use the procurement manual if the financing agreements state that it will apply. \nThus, the government currently applies parallel procurement systems that are both mandatory \nfor government agencies, depending on the source of financing.  \n \n8.  The medium-term goal for the government is to unify the IRRPP and the procurement \nmanual,  probably  by  subsuming  the  IRRPP  into  the  manual.  As  an  interim  measure,  the \ngovernment seeks to strengthen the capacity of staff who are users of the manual through an \nextensive training and certification program. In effect, the procurement training will benefit a \nlarge majority of project implementation units in Cambodia, irrespective of whether the projects \nare  funded  by  development  partners  or  the  government\u2019s  own  resources.  The  reality  in \nCambodia is that most government procurement officers in line ministries are dealing with both \ntypes of projects anyway.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  support  the  government\u2019s  priorities  of  implementing  an  ongoing  public \nfinancial management reform program and its Aid Management Policy. It will also support the \ngovernment\u2019s commitments under the Paris Declaration and the Busan Outcome Statement \n(2011) to strengthen its country systems to a standard that will allow greater utilization by the \ndevelopment partners. \n \n10.  Capacity building will be implemented in two phases. The first will focus on accelerated \ntraining on the procurement manual, on the use of SOP for project administration, and the use \nof the FMM for executing and implementing agencies of externally assisted projects. Phase 1 \nwill also include a training-of-trainers (TOT) program and an interim certification program for the \ntrainees. Phase 2 (to be implemented in 2015) will create an institutionalized professional \ntraining and certification program in procurement, likely to be executed by the Department of \nPublic Procurement of MEF. The government will seek separate funding for phase 2 from other \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008. Public Financial Management for Rural Development Program. Manila (Grant 0133-CAM). \n ", "3   \ndevelopment partners. Phase 1 will thus closely involve the Department of Public Procurement \nand development partners to ensure that institutional arrangements for phase 2 can be finalized \nby the end of phase 1. \n \n11.  Lessons from previous capacity development efforts include the need for government \nstaff to train other government staff under a TOT program. This arrangement will contribute to \nensuring long-term sustainability of domestic training capacity by building a pool of talented \nprocurement and financial management trainers. The Economics and Finance Institute under \nMEF,  which  is  mandated  to  train  public  civil  servants  in  the  areas  of  public  finance  and \neconomics, is presently involved in training 500\u20131,000 public servants annually under a multi-\ndonor trust fund project managed by the World Bank.5 It is therefore considered an appropriate \ninstitution to implement the TOT program.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be greater aid effectiveness through better use of government \nsystems. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of government officials for procurement, \nfinancial management, and project administration to better implement externally funded projects \nand programs that are guided by the SOP, procurement manual, and FMM.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will support development and implementation of (i) a TOT program to build the \ncapacity of government trainers to help deliver training workshops; (ii) accelerated training on \nprocurement, financial management, and project administration; and (iii) an interim certification \nprogram for project managers, procurement officers, and finance officers. The activities are \noutlined below. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n14.   Training of trainers. The main purpose of this program is to train 10 public officers with \nexperience in procurement and 15 with experience in financial management as trainers and \nresource persons who will assist the training consultants in the various training workshops. The \ncandidates will be selected from among those officers who have a proven record of successfully \nimplementing externally financed projects. Recommendations will be sought from project team \nleaders of ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank to ensure \nquality selection. The 10 candidates for the procurement and 15 candidates for the financial \nmanagement TOT will be selected from within MEF and other government entities. An additional \n20  will  be  chosen  by  a  selection  committee  with  the  assistance  of  the  external  training \nconsultants. MEF will use its own resources to pay stipends to the trainers in line with practices \napplied under similar MEF-led training programs. The selected officers will undergo intensive \ntraining on the updated SOP, procurement manual, and FMM (as applicable) in four training \nsessions of 5 working days each. The trainers, after completing training and testing, will be \nofficially accredited by MEF. \n \n15.  Accelerated training. Government project managers and key procurement and finance \nstaff from all ministries assigned to implement externally funded projects or programs guided by \nthe manuals will be trained in a modular format. Consultants recruited for this purpose will \n                                                 \n5 World Bank. 2005. Public Financial Management and Accountability Project. Washington, DC (TF054547). \n \n ", "4   \ndevelop three modules covering SOP, procurement manual, and FMM. Modular training will \ninclude 18 workshops each in 2013 and 2014, to be held in a province outside Phnom Penh. \nAfter a quick training needs assessment, the consultants will prepare training materials, a \ndetailed training program for both years, and the criteria for selecting the trainees, and will then \nconduct the training workshops. The workshops will be offered regularly for groups of 20, each \nworkshop lasting up to 5 working days per module. All groups will be required to go through all \nthe modules. It is envisaged that nine groups will be trained in the first year, and nine groups in \nthe second year. The achievements of the training will be evaluated throughout the program by \nan independent evaluator. Also, periodic surveys among supervisors of the trainees will be \nconducted to ensure that the training program remains relevant. The 2-year training program will \nbe the starting point for a full-fledged training and certification program under phase 2 for \ngovernment  officers  working  on  externally  funded  and  government-financed  projects.  All \nactivities will be carefully designed to ensure that phases 1 and 2 are linked. Phase 2 will \nintroduce an internationally recognized body to independently perform accreditations with due \nconsideration to performance management and compliance systems to sustain the merits of the \ncertification program. \n \n16.  Interim certification program. This will enable staff to attain recognition of their skills. It \nwill also provide a level of comfort to the management of executing and implementing agencies \nthat staff with the right skills fill the important positions of project manager, procurement officer, \nand finance officer. The interim certification program will be offered for a transitory period until a \nmore robust and long-term professional development program is established under phase 2, for \nwhich JICA initially expressed interest in funding. The finance officers will be tested on their \nknowledge  of  the  updated  SOP,  FMM,  and  general  principles  of  procurement,  while  the \nprocurement officers will be tested on the provisions of the updated procurement manual and \nability to carry out procurement tasks. The training will also enable staff to better understand the \ndifferences between (i) the SOP; (ii) ADB, JICA, and World Bank guidelines; and (iii) the IRRPP. \nConsultants will develop the certification program and the assessment procedures. MEF will \nissue  the  interim  certifications.  Approaches  being  applied  in  ADB's  ongoing  in-house \nProcurement Accreditation Skills Scheme may be integrated into the program. The output will \nalso  prepare  for  phase  2,  where  an  internationally  recognized  body  will  put  in  place  a \ncomprehensive accreditation program to ensure sustainability of the certification program. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000 million, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  staff  time  and  allowances,  office  accommodation,  transport,  and \nstipends. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. All disbursements under the \nTA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MEF will be the executing agency. A project management office will be set up under the \nDepartment of Investment and Cooperation to manage day-to-day TA activities. The TA team \nwill work closely with MEF\u2019s Department of Public Procurement to ensure harmonization with \nthe Public Procurement Law and the Public Financial Management Reform Secretariat. The TA \nteam will also work with MEF\u2019s subcommittee on capacity building to align the TA with the \nimplementation of the government-led public financial management reform program, and with \n ", "5   \nthe Economics and Finance Institute or a similar body to deliver the TOT activities in phase 1 \nand to ensure a link to phase 2, with a focus on establishing a learning institution in Cambodia. \n \n19.  The TA will require (i) 26 person-months of international consultant inputs\u2014procurement \ntraining and certification expert (9 person-months intermittent), financial management expert \n(8 person-months intermittent), project management expert (6 person-months intermittent), and \ntraining  evaluator  (3 person-months  intermittent)\u2014and  (ii)  48  person-months  of  national \nconsultant inputs\u2014procurement expert (12 person-months intermittent), financial management \nexpert  (12  person-months  intermittent),  and  training  coordinator  (24  person-months).  All \nconsultants will be based within the executing agency.  \n \n20.  The consultants will be recruited individually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nof the consultants are in Appendix 3. Office equipment totaling not more than $30,000 will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The equipment will be handed over to the executing agency upon completion of the TA. \nThe executing agency will administer expenses for training and workshops via an advance \npayment facility. The executing agency has sufficient capacity to complete the activity and \nliquidate the advance. Individual consultants are preferred since they can be mobilized faster \nthan  firms;  the  work  they  undertake  is  not  dependent  on  the  outputs  produced  by  other \nconsultants. The executing agency will be subject to a strict performance monitoring system, \nand staff from ADB's Cambodia Resident Mission will supervise the TA implementation. These \nare important lessons learned from past TA projects. \n \n21.  The  TA  may  also  require  input  from  a  reputable  international  institution  or \nprofessional(s). JICA may assist with the selection of providers and may be consulted for \ninformation on the short list given its previous involvement in providing training assistance on \nproject management and evaluation to the government. The evaluation process will track the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the training program.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented from October 2012 to October 2014. The TA\u2019s expected \noutcomes will be jointly monitored and evaluated by MEF and ADB during inception, midterm, \nand final review missions, and TA progress will be discussed on a regular basis by utilizing an \nexisting portfolio performance forum, such as the regular joint portfolio performance reviews \norganized by ADB and MEF and annual CPRM reviews. \n           \n   \nIV.
