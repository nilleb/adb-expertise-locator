THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Regional integration is crucial for the Kyrgyz Republic to enhance its global connectivity, \nincrease international trade and ultimately diversify livelihoods. Two major Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) corridors 1 and 3 provide the regional connectivity with other \nCentral Asian neighbors\u2014the Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road (part of CAREC Corridor 1) and the \nBishkek-Osh Road (part of CAREC Corridor 3). These corridors also enable a North-South \nconnectivity within the country. The proposed project will rehabilitate 34 kilometers (km) of \nBishkek Northern Bypass road, linking CAREC Corridor 1 with CAREC Corridor 3. The project \nroad  will  also  improve  the  connectivity  of  two  major  economic  centers\u2014the  Bishkek  Free \nEconomic Zone and the Dordoy Bazaar, with the global markets. \n \n2.  The proposed project will contribute to the climate resilience and sustainability of the road \nsubsector projects, the institutional development, and the diversification of livelihoods. To mitigate \nurban sprawl and reduce congestion in the future caused by the improvement of the bypass road, \nthe proposed project will finance the development of a environmental buffer zone on both sides \nof the road. A vocational training component will provide alternative livelihood opportunities for \nmen and women living in the project area. Finally, to address road safety issues in the country, it \nis proposed to carry out institutional reforms in the Ministry of Transport and Roads (MOTR) to \nset up a dedicated unit for road safety, which will supervise road safety audits on all road \nreconstruction projects in the country. \n \n3.  The project will be aligned with the following impact: competitiveness of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic increased1. It will result in the following outcome: connectivity and road safety on the \nBishkek Northern Bypass Road improved. Outputs will include (i) rehabilitation of the Bishkek \nNorthern Bypass Road; (ii) development of environmental buffer zone on both sides of the Bypass \nRoad, subject to availability of land; (iii) road safety audit and institutional reforms; and (iv) local \nresidents\u2019 skills in car repairs and related capacity improved. These project components are \nconsistent with the Country Partnership Strategy 2018\u20132022 for Kyrgyz Republic (CPS)  and will \nensure economic and social development2. \n \n4.  The project is currently estimated to cost about $90 million. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is currently considering a concessional loan of $60 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and a grant of $12 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund). The proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) and the ensuing loan and grant are \nlisted in the Country Operations Business Plan 2019\u20132021 (currently undergoing the approval \nprocess).  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The TRTA will help the government prepare the road reconstruction project, design the \nreform program for road safety, and design the vocational education project. The TRTA will \nensure that the project will be prepared to acceptable technical, safeguards, and procurement \n                                                \n1  Government of Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

Output 1: Technical due diligence on ensuing project carried out. This output will \ninclude a due diligence of the road design prepared by the Executing Agency\u2014the Ministry of \nTransport and Roads (MOTR) and will propose amendments to take on board the findings of the \nroad safety audit4. The detailed design will be revised to make it consistent with internationally-\naccepted standards and to make it suitable for ADB financing. Other technical due diligence will \nbe carried out to ensure that the proposed road rehabilitation will meet the anticipated traffic \ngrowth.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Feasibility study on ensuing project prepared. This output will include \npreparing  project  cost  estimates,  conducting  economic  analysis,  preparing  safeguards \ndocumentation for the environmental and social aspects of the project consistent with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards  Policy  Statement  2009,  and  preparing  a  gender  action  plan  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for such analyses. It will also include a scoping of the environmental buffer zone \ndevelopment, road safety reforms component and the vocational education component envisaged \nunder the ensuing project. \n \n8.  Output 3: Procurement support provided. This output will include preparing master and \ncontract-specific bidding documents, assisting the government with obtaining government and \nADB approval of them, and preparing final versions of them for issue to potential bidders.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The technical assistance (TA) is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,050,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of furnished office accommodation in \nBishkek and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items to be funded by ADB under \nthe TRTA are listed in Appendix 1. Additional consulting inputs may be required to complete the \nTRTA to its intended scope. Should this eventuate, a request for additional financing will be \nprocessed.  \n \n10.  The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. The Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) will select, \nsupervise and evaluate consultants, and procure goods.  The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 1. \n \n   \n                                                \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2018 \n4  The TRTA will include a road safety audit to be carried out by international road safety expert.

The international consultants will be recruited as individuals with time-based contracts. \nThe national consultants will be recruited as a firm (contract size $175,000 approximately) on \nsingle source selection (SSS) basis. The SSS method is justified on the basis of: (i) the work \ninvolves continuation of the activities related to modification of the detailed design taking on board \nthe findings of the road safety audit; (ii) limited capacity of the local consulting market for \nundertaking detailed design and due diligence activities; and (iii) the nature of the due diligence \nactivities requiring a combination of technical, social and environmental inputs. It is proposed that \nthe consulting firm that is currently undertaking the preparation of the detailed design be recruited \nfor this purpose.
