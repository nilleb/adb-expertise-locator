I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Guangxi Southwestern Cities Development \nProject. \n \n2.  The project1 will support the urban development of three medium-sized cities in the \nsouthwestern part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi)\u2014Fangchenggang \nCity, Chongzuo City, and Baise City. All the project cities are surrounded by counties with \nwidespread poverty. The project will have six investment components in the project cities and \none capacity development component. The investment components in each project city will be \npart of an overall city development program guided by a well-prepared city development master \nplan.  The  capacity  development  component  is  designed  to  complement  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment to be funded under the project.  \n \n3.  The project has a number of special features. It is part of the national poverty reduction \nstrategy to promote inclusive growth in the less-developed western PRC. All the project cities \nare  at  strategic  positions  of  the  regional  transport  corridors  under  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) economic cooperation framework. Development of the urban economy in \nthese cities is the driving force in converting these transport corridors into economic corridors for \nGMS economic cooperation, which the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting. The \nproject has adopted a holistic approach to building urban roads and underground municipal \ninfrastructure  in  a  coherent  and  integrated  manner.  Construction  of  urban  infrastructure  is \nsupported with capacity development and environmental improvement components, including \nactivities to strengthen climate change resilience of coastal and inland urban areas. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Guangxi is one of the 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions targeted for \nsupport under the government's National Strategy for Development of the West. This is a long-\nterm  strategic  initiative  to  rebalance  the  economic  development  of  different  regions  in  the \ncountry. It includes massive investment to (i) build and/or upgrade the infrastructure to improve \ntheir connectivity and productivity, (ii) deploy and relocate strategic industries in these less-\ndeveloped provinces and autonomous regions to facilitate economic transformation and create \njobs,  and  (iii)  promote  urban  development  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  living \nconditions.  The  government  proposes  the  project  as  part  of  the  support  for  accelerated \nurbanization and economic development in poverty-stricken southwestern Guangxi.  \n \n5.  Guangxi and the project cities have unique comparative advantages. Guangxi is the only \nwestern province and/or autonomous region of the PRC that has both deepwater seaports and \nland ports at the international borders. Guangxi serves as the gateway for many landlocked \nwestern provinces to the international market. Through intensive investment in the construction \nof transport infrastructure under the National Strategy for Development of the West, Guangxi \nhas built a well-developed expressway system that directly connects Yunnan and Guizhou, two \n                                                 \n1  The original project title was Guangxi Border Cities Development Project. Project preparatory technical assistance \nin the amount of $800,000 was approved on 4 November 2008 (TA 7160-PRC). During processing, the project title \nwas revised to better reflect the intended goal and scope of the project. ", "2 \nlandlocked and less-developed western provinces, with Guangxi's seaports at the Beibu Gulf \nand its land ports at the international border with Viet Nam.  \n \n6.  The  three  project  cities  are  strategically  located  at  the  important  intersections  of \nGuangxi's transport network. Fangchenggang City serves as a multimodal transportation hub \nthat connects the expressway and railway with deepwater seaports. Chongzuo City is a regional \nlogistics center in the GMS transportation corridor and facilitates international trade with GMS \ncountries through the land ports at Guangxi's border with Viet Nam. Baise City, as a nodal city \nin the inter-province highway and expressway system, provides the critical link for Yunnan and \nGuizhou provinces to the seaports at Beibu Gulf through the transport system in Guangxi. \nGuangxi and the project cities are at the center of a number of regional cooperation endeavors, \nincluding  GMS  economic  cooperation  promoted  by  ADB,  and  the  PRC\u2013Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations free trade area.  \n \n7.  Accelerated urban development of these project cities is required not only to create non-\nagriculture jobs for the poor farmers of the surrounding counties, but also as part of the national \ndevelopment strategy to integrate the less-developed southwestern PRC with the international \nmarket through the transport networks in Guangxi. The project is consistent with the PRC \ncountry partnership strategy, 2008\u20132010,2 which emphasizes the operational focus of ADB on \nsupport  of  urban  infrastructure,  balanced  regional  development,  urban  environmental \nimprovement, and regional integration. Detailed sector analysis for the project is provided in the \nsummary sector assessment.3 \n   \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be better living conditions in the three project cities, and \nstronger ability of these cities to participate in and benefit from regional economic cooperation \nand integration. The outcome of the project will be upgraded and integrated urban infrastructure, \nand  an  urban  environment  that  will  help  the  project  cities  meet  their  long-term  urban \ndevelopment needs.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The  project  will  have  six  investment  components  and  one  capacity  development \ncomponent that will jointly generate the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Fangchenggang  road  network  and  related  municipal  infrastructure. The \nproject will build (a) 27.6 kilometers (km) of urban roads, including a 210-meter \n(m)  bridge;  and  (b)  related  municipal  infrastructure,  including  water  supply \npipeline, drainage system, sewerage pipeline, lighting, traffic control facilities, \nand landscaping. \n(ii)  Fangchenggang coastal protection and upgrading.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \n ", "4 \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nwith the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.4  The ADB loan \nwill finance the base cost including taxes and duties associated with the project expenditures,5 \nand the interest and financial charges on the ADB loan. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n12.  The government will make the loan proceeds available to GZARG, which will transfer the \nloan proceeds to the project cities in accordance with the agreed financing plan. All the above \nmentioned transfer of the loan proceeds will be arranged on the same terms and conditions as \nthose of the ADB loan. The project cities will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation \nrisks of the ADB loan. \n \n13.  The project will be jointly financed by ADB for $150 million, Fangchenggang municipal \ngovernment  (FMG)  for  $28.15  million,  Chongzuo  municipal  government  (CMG)  for \n$27.09 million, Baise municipal government (BMG) for $18.24 million, and loans of $75.55 \nmillion that have been mobilized by FMG and BMG from the domestic banks.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  150.00    50.16 \nFangchenggang municipal government    28.15    9.41 \nChongzuo municipal government    27.09    9.06 \nBaise municipal government    18.24    6.10 \nDomestic banks a    75.55    25.26 \nTotal   299.03    100.00 \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \na  Domestic banks include China Development Bank, China Agriculture Development  \n   Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The  estimated  costs  of  the  project  include  provisions  for  physical  and  price \ncontingencies totaling $31.08 million, to be financed by the counterpart funds from FMG, CMG, \nand BMG in proportion to the investment components in each project city. The government has \nassured ADB that FMG, CMG, and BMG will provide additional counterpart funding for any \nshortfall of funds or cost overruns to ensure the success of the project.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  GZARG will be the executing agency for the project. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.6   \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2010\u2013June 2015 \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2015 \n                                                 \n4  Loan Agreement; Project Agreement (Appendix 2). \n5  Project-associated taxes and duties are estimated at $11.29 million, or 3.78% of the total cost. ADB financing of \ntaxes and duties is material and relevant to the success of the project. \n6  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \nLoan closing date  31 December 2015 \nProject management \n(i)   Executing agency   Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Government (GZARG) \nGZARG has assigned a deputy governor to provide overall guidance and \nsupport for implementation of the project. \nGZARG will channel the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan proceeds from \nthe Ministry of Finance to the project cities in accordance with the agreed \nfinancing plan on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n(ii)   Oversight body   Guangxi Project Management Office (GPMO) is an interagency oversight body \nestablished by GZARG and composed as follows: \nChair: Guangxi Development and Reform Commission  \nMembers: Guangxi Finance Department, Guangxi Housing and Construction \nDepartment,  Guangxi  Environmental  Protection  Department,  Guangxi  State \nLand Resources Management Department, and the municipal governments of \nthe project cities. \n \nThe GPMO has been established at the Guangxi Development and Reform \nCommission and  will be responsible for providing coordination support for \nproject implementation across the project cities. The GPMO will be responsible \nfor preparing consolidated project reports for submission to ADB. The GPMO \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  capacity  development \ncomponent. \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Fangchenggang  municipal  government  (FMG),  Chongzuo  municipal \ngovernment  (CMG),  and  Baise  municipal  government  (BMG)  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies  of  the  project.  Each  (i)  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation of the components relating to its city; (ii) will be responsible for \nproviding counterpart funding and will be the end user of its share of the ADB \nloan; (iii) will be responsible for repayment of its share of the ADB loan, \nincluding the associated interest and financial charges; and (iv) will assume the \ninterest and foreign exchange rate variation risks related to its portion of the \nADB loan. \n \nEach implementing agency has established a municipal project management \noffice  to  ensure  coordination  support  in  implementing  the  respective \ncomponents.   \n(iv)  Project implementation  FMG, CMG, and BMG will each enter into a project implementation agreement \ncompanies  with  their  wholly  owned,  limited  liability  companies  specialized  in  city \nconstruction to implement their city's respective investment components. These \nproject  implementation  companies  will  act  as  agents  of  the  municipal \ngovernments to carry out day-to-day implementation of the project components, \nincluding procurement of goods and works. \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  8 contracts  $117.2 million \nNational competitive bidding  10 contracts  $45.6 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  137 person-months  $2.67 million \nConsultant qualification selection  Resettlement external  $100,000 \nmonitoring service \n  Individual consultant selection  4 person-months  $30,000 \nAdvance contracting and  Four  civil  works  contracts  and  three  consulting  service  contracts  will  be \nretroactive financing  procured through advance contracting.

DUE DILIGENCE \n16.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  more  than  606,000  people  in  the  project  cities  by \npromoting integrated and coordinated development of urban infrastructure, and improving the \nurban environment. Sustained urban development of these nodal cities will give the people in \nthe  surrounding  areas  with  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  the  critical  link  to  national  and \ninternational  markets,  and  create  non-agriculture  jobs  in  the  urban  areas.  The  project  is \nclassified as a targeted intervention with geographic focus.7  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n17.  The economic viability of the project as a whole and of the investment components in \neach project city has been systematically analyzed. For the project as a whole, the analysis \ncovered the macroeconomic context, the sector context, the long-term development strategies \nof Guangxi and the project cities, and the urban development history and city development \nmaster plans of each project city. For individual investment components, the analysis covered \nthe  project  rationale,  project  identification  and  alternative,  least-cost  analysis,  benefits  and \ncosts, sensitivity test, and distribution analysis.  \n \n18.  The baseline results show that economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) are 19.5% for \nFangchenggang City, 16.1% for Chongzuo City, 15.3% for Baise City, and 17.7% for the project \nas a whole. The EIRRs were tested through sensitivity analysis using a 25% decrease in \neconomic benefits as the worst-case scenario for the roads components, and a 5-year period of \nno increase in land values as the worst-case scenario under the land-value approach applied for \nthe  environmental  upgrading  and  improvement  components.  Under  these  conservative \nassumptions, the EIRRs are 14.3% for Fangchenggang City, 11.0% for Chongzuo City, 12.4% \nfor Baise City, and 13.0% for the project as a whole. The project is considered economically \nviable.8  \n \n19.  The project does not have a revenue-generating component. Financial analysis has \nbeen concentrated on the assessment of the financial impact and management of each project \ncity's municipal government. Fiscal impact and affordability have been assessed by comparing \nidentified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds  required  for  capital  expenditures  during \nproject implementation, and for operation and maintenance and debt service during operation. \nProjected debt service and incremental operation and maintenance costs for the project cities \nhave been compared with their relevant annual revenues. The results fall in the range of 0.1%\u2013\n0.2% for Fangchenggang City, 0.3%\u20130.6% for Chongzuo City, and 0.1%\u20130.6% for Baise City, \nindicating an acceptable fiscal risk.9  \n \nB.  Governance   \n20.  GZARG is a long-term partner of ADB, actively involved in implementing many different \nkinds  of  loans  and  technical  assistance  projects.  By  establishing  the  Guangxi  Project \nManagement Office (GPMO), GZARG has assigned officials with experience in working with \nmultilateral development banks to work for the project. Procurement capability assessments \nconducted  for  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  project  implementation \ncompanies confirmed their general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB \n                                                 \n7  Project Classification Summary (Appendix 2). \n8  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n9  Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \npolicy and procedural requirements, as well as the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC on \npublic procurement. As requested by the regulation of the government, GZARG has engaged \nCMC International Tendering Company as its procurement agent10 to handle the loan-funded \nprocurement of works and goods, and the recruitment of a consulting service under the project.   \n \n21.  Financial  management  assessments  have  been  conducted  for  all  three  project \nimplementation companies: Fangchenggang Port District Urban Construction and Investment \nCompany Limited, Chongzuo Urban Construction and Investment Company Limited, and Baise \nCity Development and Investment Company Limited. The assessments confirmed that the three \nproject  implementation  companies  have  competent  accounting  professionals  equipped  with \ncomputerized financial accounting and reporting systems, and adequate procedures on flow of \naccounting, financial, and physical progress for their current project activities. All companies \nhave  clearly  defined  responsibilities  with  accountability  allocated  among  different  units  at \ndifferent levels of authority within their institutions. According to the audit law of the PRC, the \nthree project implementation companies are currently subject to annual auditing conducted by \nindependent auditors. In general, the financial management assessment has concluded that the \ncurrent financial management system in these companies can meet the general requirements of \nthe government in terms of staffing, accounting, and internal control. The companies will need \ntechnical support to strengthen their capacity to implement the project in compliance with the \npolicy, operation, and procedural requirements of ADB.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the GZARG, FMG, CMG, and BMG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n23.   The project will have a strong poverty reduction impact by promoting inclusive growth in \nthe project cities, which are in a region with a high incidence of poverty. The project will create \n10,030 person-years of direct and 26,070 person-years of indirect employment opportunities, \nwith estimated earnings of CNY104.16 million from direct employment and CNY270.82 million \nfrom indirect employment. The executing agency and implementing agencies have assured \nADB  that  vulnerable  groups,  including  women,  poor  people,  and  ethnic  minorities,  will  be \nprioritized for jobs. Project performance in these areas will be closely monitored under the \nproject performance monitoring system. Details on the specific measures designed to ensure \nthe poverty and social benefits are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.11 \n     \n24.  The  project  is  categorized  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Results  from  the \nhousehold survey and focus group discussions indicate that women are primarily responsible for \ncleaning up the interior and exterior of houses after floods, as well as taking care of family \nmembers who are sick or old, and for household-related traveling and social activities. Time \nspent on these activities means less time available to them for other priorities. The project will \nhave significant benefits for women by reducing the energy, time, and effort they spend on \nthese activities, allowing them to participate more actively in income-generating activities, family \nentertainment, or leisure. Women strongly support the project across all components; they \n                                                 \n10  In the PRC, the procurement under externally funded projects is handled through a certified procurement agent \nsystem, which requires the project executing agency to engage a certified international tendering company as its \nagent to handle the loan-funded procurement operations. The procurement agent is engaged through national \ncompetitive procedures. The service is normally financed by domestic funding sources. The qualification of the \ncertified international tendering companies is subject to the licensing requirements of the government.  \n11  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nbelieve that it will improve their quality of life and create jobs and income opportunities for them. \nA gender action plan has been prepared that aims to (i) increase women\u2019s participation in the \nproject, with a target of at least 20% employment of women; (ii) provide gender-sensitive \ntraining  and  support  women's  participation  in  mangrove  and  wetland  protection,  and \nenvironmental awareness programs; (iii) promote women's participation in capacity building \nactivities; and (iv) include appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data for \nproject monitoring and evaluation.12  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n25.  The project is classified under environment category A. Major adverse impacts of the \nproject include air, water, and acoustic pollution during the construction period. In general, these \nimpacts are temporary and/or localized. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been \nprepared for each of the six investment components in accordance with relevant laws and \nregulations  of  the  PRC.  Mitigating  measures  have  been  included  in  the  EIA  to  prevent, \neliminate, or minimize the adverse impacts. The PRC's authorities have approved the six EIAs. \nADB reviewed a report summarizing the findings of the six EIAs to ensure they comply with \nADB's environmental assessment requirements prescribed in its Environment Policy (2002). \nThe summary EIA (SEIA) has been prepared with a detailed environmental management plan \n(EMP). The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 26 February 2010. The implementation of the \nEMP will be under the internal monitoring of the GPMO and municipal project management \noffices,  and  the  external  monitoring  provided  by  an  independent  environmental  monitoring \nagency.13  \n \n26.  The  project  is  expected  to  provide  multiple  incremental  improvements  to  the \nenvironment, including the benefits arising from better urban roads and the related municipal \ninfrastructure system, the protected and upgraded coastal areas in Fangchenggang City, and \nthe  rehabilitated  ecosystem  of  the  Shuikou  Lake  in  Chongzuo  City.  The  environmental \nimprovements  also  include  stronger  climate  change  resilience  in  Fangchenggang  City  and \nChongzuo City. \n \n27.   The overall land acquisition and resettlement impact for the project will be significant. \nThe project will acquire 4,550 mu (303 ha; 1 mu = 0.0667 ha) of land permanently, of which \n12.38% is classified as farmland. Permanent land acquisition will affect 924 households or \n4,474 persons. Temporary acquisition of 586 mu (39 ha) of land will affect 97 households or \n349 persons.  House  demolition  will  require  the  relocation  of  508  households.  Two  public \ninstitutions and one enterprise with 500 employees and 111 students will be affected. Removal \nof illegal structures (26,123 square meters) used for aquaculture will affect the livelihoods of 89 \nhouseholds with 725 persons. Associated productive assets, ground attachments, and basic \ninfrastructure facilities will also be affected. \n \n28.  To address the land acquisition and resettlement impacts, three full resettlement plans, \none  full  resettlement  plan  with  due  diligence,  and  one  short  resettlement  plan  have  been \nprepared for the investment components in accordance with the ADB Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC.14  \n \n                                                 \n12  Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n13  Summary Environmental Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n14  Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n29.   Ethnic minority groups are the primary beneficiaries of the project. The ethnic minorities \nwill not be adversely affected, except in the context of resettlement. Like the other residents \nliving in the project area, the ethnic minorities will be affected. The project was classified under \ncategory B in accordance with the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Special actions \nare planned and agreed with the government and GZARG in the resettlement plans to ensure \nthat the interest and benefits of the ethnic minority groups will be properly protected and the \npoverty reduction impact will be achieved. 15  \n \n30.  The government and GZARG have assured ADB that the resettlement plans will be \nupdated during engineering design, taking into account the results of detailed measurement. \nThe updated resettlement plans will be submitted to ADB for concurrence before awarding \nrelated civil works contracts, and will be disclosed in Chinese language to the project-affected \npersons. The compensation for lost assets and resettlement allowance will be paid to the \naffected persons, and the livelihood rehabilitation arrangements will be made in accordance with \nthe updated resettlement plan before beginning related civil works. \n \n31.  The government and GZARG have further assured ADB that the resettlement plans will \nbe  implemented  in  strict  conformity  with  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy. \nImplementation of the resettlement plans will be under internal monitoring and evaluation by the \nGPMO, and external monitoring and evaluation by an independent monitoring agency.
