INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the March 2004 Country Programming Mission, His Majesty's Government of \nNepal reconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the proposed Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Project. \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 Country Strategy and Program.1 The TA Fact-Finding Mission \nwas fielded in Nepal 15\u201323 September 2004 and reached an understanding with the Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA),  the  Alternative  Energy  Promotion  Center  (AEPC),  and  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, costs, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and \noutline terms of reference for the TA.2 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita gross domestic \nproduct of around $270 in fiscal year (FY) 2004 and an estimated overall poverty incidence of \n38%. Poverty is more prevalent and severe in rural areas, where at 44%, the poverty incidence \nis almost double the 23% in urban areas.1 The Government\u2019s Tenth Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007) \naims to reduce the overall poverty ratio to 30% by FY2007 and promotes equitable and \nregionally balanced economic growth. Consistent with this plan, the Government has declared \nits commitment to rural electrification, which has become a high national priority because of its \npotential to improve living standards and accelerate economic growth, and thereby to reduce \npoverty and regional disparities. Appendix 2 presents an initial poverty and social analysis.  \n \n3.  The total installed generating capacity in Nepal is only 610 megawatts (MW), and per \ncapita electricity consumption of 93 kilowatt-hours per year is among the lowest in the world. \nThe extent of electrification is also low: only about one third of the population currently has \naccess to electricity, and in rural areas, where 80% of the nation\u2019s population resides, access is \nmuch  lower.  Despite  the  great  potential  for  hydropower  development,  power  sector \ndevelopment has been constrained mainly because of the relatively small size of Nepal\u2019s \neconomy  and  the  small  size  of  modern  industrial  and  commercial  sectors.  However,  the \ndemand for power has increased steadily, with an annual average growth rate of 8.5% over the \npast decade, and is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 7.6% until 2020. The Tenth Plan sets \nout the Government\u2019s goal of providing electricity to 55% of the population by FY2007. This \nrequires continuing rapid expansion of electrification in the country.  \n \n4.  The power sector is organized under the Ministry of Water Resources. The Government, \nthrough the ministry, wholly owns and supervises NEA, which is responsible for all transmission \nand  most  distribution  and  generation  throughout  the  country.  Various  independent  power \nproducers also generate electricity, and small power companies and some nongovernment \norganizations  account  for  a  marginal  portion  of  distribution.  Because  villages  are  widely \ndispersed across the country, a grid connection is not always economical, and in some cases, \noff-grid connection of remote rural villages through the use of renewable energy may be the \nmost economical option. Hence AEPC, under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and \nTechnology,  is  implementing  off-grid  electrification  in  remote  rural  areas  using  renewable \nenergy technologies, mostly microhydro systems and a limited number of solar home systems.  \n \n5.  NEA has been a key player in rural electrification and has undertaken a number of rural \nelectrification projects to expand distribution in rural areas with financial support from the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Nepal. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 August 2004. ", "2 \nGovernment  and  various  external  development  agencies.  ADB  is  playing  a  lead  role  in \nsupporting NEA\u2019s rural electrification and has approved several loans to NEA, including a recent \nloan for electrification in rural districts of the Eastern, Central, and Western regions of Nepal.3 \nOther development agencies, such as the World Bank, the Danish International Development \nAgency, and the Swedish International Development Agency, have also supported NEA with on-\ngrid rural electrification in the country\u2019s Far-Western and Mid-Western regions. In parallel, in \n2003 NEA embarked on a community-based electrification program with an annual budget of \nabout $6 million to provide technical support and subsidies to selected rural communities. NEA \nis also responsible for constructing and operating isolated, small hydroelectric schemes with a \ncapacity of 1 MW and above and associated rural electrification. In view of the vast demand for \non-grid rural electrification and in line with its Country Strategy and Program, ADB will continue \nto assist rural electrification, primarily through extensions of service from NEA\u2019s integrated grid.    \n \n6.  Many external development agencies, such as the Danish International Development \nAgency, the Norwegian Agency for International Development, the World Bank, the United \nNations Development Programme, and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(the German Agency for Technical Cooperation) are providing financial and technical support to \nAEPC in undertaking rural electrification in isolated areas\u2014 which the national grid will not \nreach  in  the  next  5  years\u2014on an off-grid basis. With this assistance, AEPC is promoting \nmicrohydro generation by providing technical support for different steps in project development \nand subsidies through its separate body, the Interim Rural Energy Fund.4 The European Union \nis expected to join this effort in the near future.  \n \n7.  With the aim of improving the efficiency of the power sector, the Government\u2019s 2001 \nhydropower development policy highlights various goals, strategies, and policies, and among \nother things addresses (i) reforming the sector by advocating a new institutional structure and \nestablishing  an  enabling  environment  for  greater  private  sector  participation  in  power \ndevelopment, (ii) accelerating rural electrification by setting up a rural electrification fund, and \n(iii) strengthening the linkage between electrification and economic activities. To prepare a \nroadmap and reform plans for the power sector to address item (i), ADB provided TA focusing \non reforms of NEA,5 which will be supplemented by a follow-on TA to implement the proposed \nreform plans. The United States Agency for International Development is also providing TA for \nthe reform of regulatory functions. Addressing item (iii) entails exploring ways to link rural \nelectrification projects to other livelihood improvement and rural development projects.  \n \n8.  To address the need for efficient and accelerated rural electrification as highlighted in \nthe hydropower development policy, a series of meetings of the Energy Thematic Group, which \ncoordinates  rural  electrification  among  concerned  partners,  including  the  Government, \nmultilateral and bilateral development agencies, and embassies, resulted in the preparation of \nthe draft Code of Conduct for Development Partners Involved in Rural Electrification in Nepal. \nThe code\u2019s purpose is to facilitate the shift from a project approach to a sectorwide approach by \n(i) assisting the Government to formulate and enhance institutional means of promoting a \nsectorwide approach, (ii) streamlining operations to decrease transaction costs and maximize \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Rural Electrification, Distribution, and Transmission Project. Manila. (Loan 1732-NEP[SF], \nfor $50 million, approved on 21 December 1999).  \n4  According to its mandate, AEPC may develop hydropower generation plants of up to 1 MW per unit; however, it is \nundertaking the development of microhydro generation units with capacities of 100 kilowatts or less because of \ntechnical difficulties in identifying feasible projects above 100 kilowatts.  \n5  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Power Sector Reforms in Nepal. Manila. (TA No. \n3552-NEP. $800,000, approved on 27 November 2000.)  ", "    3 \nthe cost-effectiveness of interventions, and (iii) increasing collaboration between partners to \npromote more effective use of human and financial resources in the sector. As this initiative is \nstill in a conceptual stage, it will take a few years before it is ready to be implemented. Until \nthen,  traditional  financial  support  to  the  Government  for  implementing  rural  electrification \nprograms is essential, while at the same time adhering to the principles outlined under the \ninitiative.  \n \n9.  The  Project  Performance  Audit  Report  for  ADB\u2019s  Seventh  Power  Project  identified \nvarious issues pertaining to future ADB operations in the power sector in Nepal,6 including the \nfollowing: (i) inadequate tariff adjustments affect NEA\u2019s financial performance, (ii) NEA\u2019s system \nlosses are excessive, (iii) current tariff structures and operating conditions impose a significant \nfinancial  burden  on  NEA,  and  (iv)  many  poor  households  cannot  afford  the  high  initial \nconnection costs. The Project Performance Audit Report for a previous ADB minihydro project \nrated it as unsuccessful because of long delays in implementing subprojects, cost overruns, \nhigh operating and maintenance costs, and insufficient energy sales leading to unsatisfactory \nrates of return.7 One of the key lessons learned was that if feasible, such small, numerous, and \nscattered  projects  are  best  implemented  and  operated  by  end  users  and  local  private \ncompanies rather than by a large and centrally managed public utility. ADB\u2019s ongoing Rural \nElectrification, Distribution, and Transmission Project (footnote 3) has a component to finance \nthe development of electricity distribution systems for small, isolated power supply projects off \nthe integrated NEA distribution grid, but virtually no progress has been made because of the \ndifficulties of finding suitable subprojects, especially under the prevailing subsidy policy for off-\ngrid connections. In addition, the insurgency, which has now spread to most parts of the country \nwith varying degrees of intensity, calls for a conflict assessment of the proposed project areas \nand the development of effective implementation strategies, even though the insurgency has not \nhad a significant impact on rural electrification in the past. This, as well as the lessons learned \nduring the execution of previous projects, has been taken into account in preparing the terms of \nreference for this TA.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA will help the Government identify a technically, financially, and economically \nviable on-grid rural electrification project to provide an affordable electricity supply to selected \nrural areas. This will contribute to raising their standards of living and facilitate the establishment \nof physical and social infrastructure and income generating opportunities to support sustainable \neconomic growth in those areas, and thereby reduce disparities between rural and urban \nstandards of living. If justified, the Project will include the reinforcement and development of \nassociated transmission and distribution systems in existing service areas. Where feasible, it \nwill also support the development of off-grid renewable energy subprojects in remote rural \nareas.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  include  (i)  the  preparation  of  plans  to  provide  rural  electrification  by \nextending  the  integrated  national  grid,  (ii)  the  preparation  of  plans  to  strengthen  NEA\u2019s \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1990.

", "4 \ntransmission and distribution network, and (iii) a study on feasible ways to deliver the Project \nfollowing the principles outlined under the  sectorwide approach. The TA will also incorporate a \nfeasibility study of the best method for ADB to assist AEPC in developing a least-cost renewable \nenergy supply for remote, off-grid communities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will be undertaken in two parts, Part A: On-Grid Rural Electrification, and Part B: \nOff-Grid Rural Electrification. Part A will examine the capital expansion plans of grid-connected \nrural  electrification  and  NEA\u2019s  reinforcement  of  associated  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems from 2007 to 2010 to identify subprojects suitable for ADB financing. To this end, NEA \nwill use internal resources for the initial technical preparation of projects, including developing \npreliminary  selection  criteria  for  rural  electrification  schemes  and  identifying  all  candidate \nschemes based on their technical, financial, economical, environmental, and social justifications. \nThe TA consultants, in conjunction with NEA staff, will then (i) review all relevant previous \nstudies of and reports on rural electrification and distribution planning in Nepal, (ii) identify and \nscreen potential rural electrification schemes based on the established selection criteria and on \nrequirements for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts, (iii) review the power \nsupply  capacity  in  the  areas  to  be  electrified  to  identify  ways  to  strengthen  associated \ntransmission and distribution systems; (iv) undertake economic and financial analysis of the \nsubprojects, (v) conduct a social analysis of the benefits and poverty reduction impacts of the \nsubprojects  and  undertake  an  initial  environmental  examination,  (vi)  determine  the  most \nappropriate and effective arrangements for implementing the Project, and (vii) determine the \nbest  procedures  for  procuring  materials  and  constructing  subprojects  and  identify  major \nprocurement packages. The consultants will also review the Government\u2019s policies related to \nrural electrification, the final report on Rural Electrification in Nepal and Possibilities for a \nSectorwide Approach funded by the Norwegian Agency for International Development, the Code \nof Conduct for Development Partners Involved in Rural Electrification in Nepal, and experiences \nwith a sectorwide approach in the education and health sectors in Nepal.  \n \n13.  Part B will involve a feasibility study for ADB involvement in off-grid rural electrification in \nclose association with AEPC. The study will review experience with off-grid electricity supply \nprojects in Nepal and assess their technical, economic, and financial sustainability. It will also \nreview the demand for off-grid rural electrification during 2007\u20132010 and the activities and plans \nof the Government and of multilateral and bilateral development agencies. Based on this review, \nand taking the country\u2019s absorptive capacity into account, the consultants will recommend an \noptimum  modality  and  scope  for  ADB  financing.  Only  those  types  of  renewable  energy \nsubprojects that are practical, sustainable, and cost-effective and have high poverty reduction \nimpacts will be considered for financing under the Project.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $740,000 equivalent, consisting of $490,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $250,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $600,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $110,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The Government will contribute the balance of the local currency \ncost,  equivalent  to  $140,000,  in kind as office space and facilities, counterpart staff, local \ntransportation, and administrative and secretarial  support. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing Project. ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  NEA will be the executing agency for Part A of the TA and AEPC will be the executing \nagency for Part B. NEA\u2019s deputy managing director for planning, monitoring, and information \ntechnology and AEPC\u2019s executive director will be responsible for supervising the studies to be \ncarried out under the TA. To achieve an optimum project design, at least three workshops will \nbe held in Kathmandu to review the inception report, interim report, and draft final report \nprepared by the consultants. Participants will consist of representatives of various stakeholder \ngroups, including senior Government officials. At least 3 weeks prior to the workshops, the \nconsultants will submit each of the reports to NEA, which will, distribute them to relevant \nstakeholders  for  comment  and  discussions  at  the  workshops.  The  list  of  invitees  for  the \nworkshops  will  include  senior  Government  officials  at  least  at  the  joint  secretary  level \nrepresenting the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of Water \nResources, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Local Development; \nsenior  NEA  and  AEPC  staff;  and  representatives  from  private  sector  companies  and \ncooperatives involved in rural electrification. Comments received from various stakeholders will \nbe duly reflected in the design of the Project. NEA will provide counterpart engineering staff to \nwork with the consultants, office facilities in Kathmandu, and vehicles for field trips. AEPC will \nalso provide counterpart engineering staff.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months, starting in March 2005 and \nending in October 2005. ADB will select and engage a consulting firm, supported by associated \ndomestic consultants, with relevant experience in all aspects of the specified scope of work, in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection will be used \nin selecting the consulting firm. The TA will require 12 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 24 person-months of domestic consulting services, of which 1 person-month of \ninternational and 2 person-months of domestic consulting services will be allocated for Part B of \nthe TA. The outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 4.  \n \n17.  The consultants will submit various reports simultaneously to NEA, AEPC, and ADB, \ncombining Part A and Part B. An inception report will be submitted within 1 month from the \nmobilization of the consultants and will detail initial findings and the consultants\u2019 proposed action \nplan for conducting the study. Within 3 weeks of the receipt of the inception report, a tripartite \nmeeting and workshop will be convened in Kathmandu to discuss the report. An interim report \nwill be submitted within 4 months of the mobilization of the consultants and a draft final report \nwithin 6 months of the mobilization of the consultants. These reports will also be reviewed at a \ntripartite meeting and workshop in Kathmandu. A final report will be submitted within 4 weeks \nafter the consultants have received comments from NEA, AEPC, and ADB.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for preparing the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \n \nNepal, with a population of 23 million, is among the world\u2019s poorest countries. Its average per capita annual income is \n$270, and poverty incidence is estimated at 38%. The poverty incidence varies widely from region to region. The rural \npoverty incidence is around 44%, which is almost double  the 23% in urban areas. Even though social indicators \nimproved in the 5 years to fiscal year (FY) 2002, much remains to be done. In FY2002, the literacy rate remained low \nat 49%, compared with the Ninth Plan target of 70%, the infant mortality rate remained at 64.2 per 1,000 births, and \nthe maternal mortality rate was estimated at 415 per 1,000 births. \n \nPoverty alleviation is the overriding goal of the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan (FY2002\u2013FY2007).1 The Tenth Plan aims to \nreduce the incidence of  poverty to 30% by 2007 and  10% by 2017. Central to the national strategy for  poverty \nreduction is the provision of basic economic and physical infrastructure such as electricity. Given the Nepal\u2019s stage of \ndevelopment, the provision of basic energy needs will not only provide poor households with a  much needed catalyst \nto stimulate their economic activities, but will also catalyze improvements in literacy and mortality rates.  \n \nUnder the Tenth Plan, the Government aims at an electrification ratio (the ratio of the number of people connected to \nelectricity to the total population) of 55% in 2007, up from the current 40%. This would mean that some 650,000 \nadditional households were connected to electricity. This will be achieved in part by electrifying the rural areas, where \n80% of Nepalese live. International experience suggests that the provision of electricity will considerably improve the \nquality of life of the poor  both indirectly and directly, by stimulating economic activities that would otherwise be \nimpossible, such as agribusinesses; permitting productive activities to be carried out for longer each day; and in some \ncases even allowing farmers to  switch to higher-yield crops. Rural electrification can  also potentially increase the \nmultiplier effect of  ongoing rural development initiatives.  Direct effects on the poor include  longer study hours for \nschool-age children and improved health standards. In addition, electrification facilitates social advocacy and health \ncampaigns using electronic media. \n                                                 \n1  The Tenth Plan\u2019s poverty reduction strategy has been guided by a few key considerations, in particular, the need \nfor any poverty reduction strategy to be oriented toward rural areas. The strategy is built on four pillars: (i) broadly \nbased economic growth; (ii) social sector development, including human development; (iii) targeted programs for \nbringing the poor and marginalized groups into the mainstream; and (iv) good governance. \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n \nB.
