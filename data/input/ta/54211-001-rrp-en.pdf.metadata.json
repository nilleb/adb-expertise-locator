THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nof up to $52,000,000, comprising (a) an A loan of up to $12,000,000 and (b) a B loan of up to \n$40,000,000 to Lien Lap Wind Power Joint Stock Company (Lien Lap); (ii) a proposed loan of up \nto $52,000,000, comprising (a) an A loan of up to $12,000,000 and (b) a B loan of up to \n$40,000,000 to Phong Huy Wind Power Joint Stock Company (Phong Huy); and (iii) a proposed \nloan of up to $52,000,000, comprising (a) an A loan of up to $12,000,000 and (b) a B loan of up \nto $40,000,000 to Phong Nguyen Wind Power Joint Stock Company (Phong Nguyen), all for the \nLotus Wind Power Project in Viet Nam. \n \n2.  The loans will support Lien Lap, Phong Huy, and Phong Nguyen to each develop, \nconstruct, and operate a 48-megawatt (MW) wind farm (144 MW in total) in Quang Tri Province \nin central Viet Nam. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its capacity as the mandated lead \narranger (MLA), has mobilized commercial banks and other development finance institutions to \nprovide long-term, United States (US) dollar limited-recourse project financing unavailable in the \nlocal market. The project will be one of the first and largest wind farms financed by the private \nsector in Viet Nam and will increase the country\u2019s wind capacity by nearly 30%.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Electricity demand in Viet Nam has grown at a compound annual \nrate of 13% since 2000 and is projected to grow at 8% annually through 2030.2 Meeting this power \ndemand would require an expansion in generation capacity from 48.7 gigawatts (GW) in 2018 to \n100 GW by 2030, as well as alternatives to carbon-intensive power projects to avoid significant \nincreases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.3 The Revised National Power Development \nMaster Plan for the 2011\u20132020 Period with the Vision to 2030 (Revised PDP 7) sought to increase \nthe share of wind generation capacity to 2,000 MW by 2025, and 6,000 MW by 2030.4 The \nNational Power Development Master Plan for the 2021\u20132030 Period with the Vision to 2050 (PDP \n8) is being finalized and is expected to further prioritize renewable energy.5 \n \n4.  In 2011 Viet Nam introduced a feed-in tariff (FIT) of $0.0780 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and \na standard power purchase agreement (PPA) template for utility-scale wind power projects,6 but \nfrom 2011 to 2018 only three wind power projects with a total capacity of 153.2 MW had reached \ncommercial operation.7 The limited success was because of two key factors: (i) the FIT level was \nnot deemed sufficient by project developers and financiers and (ii) the standard PPA was not \nconsidered bankable for international lenders on a non-recourse project finance basis. In contrast, \nsince Viet Nam introduced a FIT of $0.0935/kWh in 2017 for utility-scale solar power projects, \nabout 8.9 GW of solar capacity had been commissioned by September 2020, which far exceeded \n \n1  As of 2019, the total installed onshore and offshore wind power capacity stood at 490 MW.

Ha Noi. \n ", "2 \nthe targets under the Revised PDP 7.8 Most of these were financed by local banks, which have \nnot expressed the same level of interest in financing wind power projects because of their \nunfamiliarity with the technology and the greater complexity of wind power projects. \n \n5.  To spur interest in wind power development, Viet Nam increased the FIT to $0.085/kWh \nfor onshore wind projects in 2018. To qualify for this FIT, the commercial operation date must be \nbefore 1 November 2021.9 Viet Nam also revised the standard wind PPA template in early 2019 \nto improve its bankability, including termination payments, which had previously been identified \nas a key project inhibitor by potential financiers.10 In response to these positive developments, a \nlocal project developer, Power Construction Joint Stock Company No. 1 (PCC1), approached \nADB in 2019 seeking long-term US dollar financing for the project. The project stood out among \nthe many proposals presented to ADB for its significant size; its ideal location with strong wind \nresources; and PCC1\u2019s extensive experience in Viet Nam\u2019s power infrastructure sector and \ncommitment to provide comprehensive sponsor support, which addresses key shortcomings of \nthe PPA.11  \n \n6.  Gender  context.  Viet  Nam  has  made  considerable  progress  in  addressing  gender \ndisparities. However, women\u2019s economic opportunities remain constrained due to a persistent \ngender pay gap, significant segregation of men and women in terms of occupation and industry \nof employment, an unequal burden of unpaid care work, and general resistance to women taking \nup leadership positions.12 In 2019, women represented 27% of employees in the utilities sector \nand 16% of management positions in Viet Nam.13 Likewise, in the renewable energy sector, only \na small proportion of women are in management, technical, and field-based roles, with the highest \nconcentrations  of  women  in  administration,  finance,  and  human  resources.  This  project \nincorporates gender measures that seek to support the closing of these gaps. \n \n7.  Project design. The project entails the development, construction, and operation of three \n48 MW wind farms (144 MW in total) and the internal transmission lines in Quang Tri Province, to \nbe implemented under three 20-year PPAs with Vietnam Electricity (EVN). The project is expected \nto be commissioned in phases from May to September 2021. \n \n8.  Borrowers. The three borrowers\u2014Lien Lap, Phong Huy, and Phong Nguyen\u2014are owned \nby  PCC1,  Renova,  Inc.  (Renova)  and  individual  shareholders  owning  less  than  3%. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n9.  Sponsors. PCC1 is a domestic leader in the power infrastructure sector in Viet Nam with \nmore than 50 years of experience. It specializes in constructing power transmission networks and \nhas  interests  in  industrial  manufacturing,  energy,  real  estate,  and  consulting  services.  In \nparticular, PCC1 is one of the largest hydropower developers in Viet Nam with seven operating \nprojects with a total capacity of 168 MW, two of which were financed by the World Bank.14 \n \n8  The Revised PDP 7 targets 850 MW solar power by 2020, 4,000 MW by 2025, and 12,000 MW by 2030. \n9  Government of Viet Nam. 2018.

[CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED] ADB\u2019s review of the project does not give ADB cause to believe that it is being used \nfor money laundering or terrorism financing, tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax fraud. \n \n12.  COVID-19 Impacts. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has not had a \nmaterial impact on the cost or implementation of the project. The progress is as scheduled. The \nproject will contribute to meeting the energy demand of Viet Nam in its post-COVID-19 recovery. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impacts. The project will be one of the first and largest wind power projects in Viet Nam. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: the share of power produced from renewable \nenergy sources in the power generation mix in Viet Nam increased to more than 10% by 2030 \nand the wind power capacity increased to 6,000 MW (2.1% of the total) by 2030 (footnote 4). \n \n14.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: renewable power delivered to the \ndomestic grid increased. It will generate an average of 422 gigawatt-hours of electricity from wind \nenergy and avoid an average of 162,430 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. \n \n15.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) wind power plants of 144 MW total \ncapacity installed, (ii) gender-inclusive local employment generated, (iii) growth of the local \neconomy  supported, (iv)  gender  inclusiveness in  PCC1\u2019s  work  environment  improved,  and \n(v) livelihood opportunities of women enhanced. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which has a target of 75% of ADB operations supporting climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030.18 The project supports three of the seven operational priorities: \n(i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (iii) addressing remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities. It further contributes to three other objectives of Strategy 2030: \n(i) expanding private sector operations to reach one-third of ADB operations in number by 2024, \n(ii) reaching $80 billion of cumulative climate finance from ADB\u2019s own resources from 2019 to \n \n15 PCC1\u2019s market capitalization was about $192 million as of January 2021. \n16 Renova\u2019s market capitalization was about $3.5 billion as of January 2021. \n17 ADB. 2003.

Consistency with country partnership strategy. The project is aligned with two of the \nthree pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020: (i) increasing the \ninclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery and (ii) improving environmental sustainability \nand climate change response. The project also supports the alignment of the country partnership \nstrategy with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange of a reduction of 8%\u201325% in GHG emissions by 2030.19 \n \n18.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which (i) aims to prioritize and broaden support for renewable energy \nprojects and (ii) encourages private sector participation.20 The project will contribute to the targets \nfor wind generation capacity in Viet Nam\u2019s Revised PDP 7 (para. 3). Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d \napproach, the project has benefited from close cross-departmental collaboration with ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department in assessing and analyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \n19.  Lessons from previous operations. The project follows ADB\u2019s prior approvals of (i) the \nfirst floating solar project in Viet Nam, the Floating Solar Energy Project (2018); and (ii) two \nground-mount solar projects, the Gulf Solar Power Project (2019) and the B.Grimm Viet Nam \nSolar Power Project (Phu Yen Project) (2020).21 The project further builds on results and lessons \nfrom the cooperation between ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and the government for energy \nsector reform.22 Based on these previous operations, ADB developed a comprehensive sponsor \nsupport package where PCC1 will be liable for any debt service shortfalls if the borrowers fail to \ngenerate sufficient cash flows for any reason, including but not limited to (i) curtailment or \nnonpayment by EVN, (ii) retroactive changes in FIT, and (iii) technical issues in the operation of \nthe wind farms. This structure partially mitigates the imperfections of the PPA, which provides \ncomfort to ADB and its cofinancing partners and maximizes the amount of cofinancing with the \nminimum possible ADB commitment. \n \n20.  Climate change financing. The total ADB A loan and cofinancing amount of up to \n$172,000,000 will be counted as climate change financing (mitigation) because it matches the \ncriteria according to the joint Multilateral Development Banks methodology.23 \n \nD.

The A loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. [CONFIDENTIAL \nINFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Financing beyond what is available in the markets. Local lenders are unable to provide \nlong-term US dollar financing, which is required to mitigate the currency mismatch risk given the \nUS dollar-denominated FIT. International lenders are reluctant to offer non-recourse project \nfinance loans because of concerns around the bankability of the PPA and the nascent nature of \nthe renewable energy sector. ADB adds value by (i) developing a limited-recourse financing \nstructure that addresses key PPA risks to attract international lenders, and (ii) mobilizing a debt \npackage that meets the currency and tenor requirements of project developers to promote private \nsector participation in renewable energy development in Viet Nam. \n \n \n24 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \n26.  Resource mobilization and catalytic impact. ADB as the MLA will catalyze financing \nfrom international commercial banks and other development finance institutions, at a cofinancing \nratio of $3.78 for every $1.00 of ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s participation is critical for mobilization, as \nADB is one of the few financial institutions with extensive experience in large-scale renewable \nenergy projects in Viet Nam, and thus serves as a trusted reference for the market. As one of the \nfirst and largest international limited-recourse project finance transactions for Viet Nam\u2019s wind \npower development, the project will demonstrate a replicable model for private sector investments \ninto wind power projects in the country, and further catalyze private sector funding in the future. \n \n27.  Enhanced standards and capacity building. ADB\u2019s involvement will ensure that the \nproject is developed, constructed, and operated to international good practice standards; and will \nstrengthen the environmental, social, and gender standards of PCC1 and the borrowers. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n28.  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) (SPS) as category B on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.25 \nADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social (E&S) \nimpacts of the project. The safeguard and social reports and plans identified measures to avoid, \nminimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts as well as benefit Van Kieu ethnic \nminorities. The environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment \nof PCC1 to manage the project\u2019s E&S impacts according to ADB\u2019s SPS requirements are deemed \nadequate. PCC1 commits to implement the E&S management plans, social safeguard plans, and \ncorrective actions plans for all three wind farms. \n \n30.  Environment. The borrowers\u2019 E&S consultant has prepared initial E&S examination \nreports and an environmental compliance audit of existing construction activities for each wind \nfarm. The project\u2019s transmission line is not considered an associated facility under the SPS \ndefinition as this will be shared with neighboring wind farms. The initial E&S examination (IESE) \nreports  identified  construction  impacts  to  include  (i)  disturbance  of  terrestrial  ecology;  (ii) \ngeneration of dust, emissions, noise, and wastes; (iii) impacts on soil erosion and water quality; \nand (iv) occupational and community health and safety risks. The Phong Nguyen and Phong Huy \nwind farms are in a protection area managed by the Dakrong Huong Hoa Protection Forest \nManagement Board and classified as plantation forests. The E&S consultant undertook a critical \nhabitat assessment and assessed all three wind farms as modified habitats. Key operational \nimpacts include (i) shadow flicker, (ii) noise, and (iii) bird and bat collision risks. Modeling results \nindicated that the Lien Lap wind farm will generate shadow flicker exceeding the World Bank \nGroup\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Wind Energy, affecting five households. \nAffected households will retain the option to relocate should their decisions change during project \noperations. The avifauna survey results indicated that none of the recorded species flying within \nthe rotor sweep zone of the turbines are listed as globally or nationally threatened in the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species or Viet Nam\u2019s \nRed Data Book, and that the project area does not support significant concentration of migratory \n \n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "7 \nbirds. Impacts during construction and operation will be addressed through implementation of the \nE&S management plans and specific sub-plans. Periodic monitoring of physical and biological \nimpacts and stakeholder consultations will be carried out by the borrowers. Adaptive management \nshall be employed when unforeseen terrestrial ecological risks are identified as a result of \ncontinuous monitoring activities. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The development of the three wind \nfarms required acquisition of production forest and agricultural lands, conversion of portions of \nmodified protection forest, and purchase and leasing of land from private users. The Lien Lap \nwind farm will affect a total of 100 households (505 persons), of which 22 households (120 people) \nlost 10% or more of their productive land, including 5 Van Kieu households. The expansion of an \nexisting village road, for use by the community and the Phong Huy and Phong Nguyen wind farms, \naffected 61 households (302 persons), involving 12 Van Kieu households (58 persons). No \nhouseholds experienced physical displacement. None of the economically displaced households \nin the Phong Huy wind farm lost more than 10% of their productive land. The Phong Nguyen wind \nfarm is located within the modified protection forest and only requires a change of land use \npurpose. The audit of the government-led land acquisition process and consultations with the \naffected  persons  confirmed  that  the  process  (i)  was  done  in  accordance  with  statutory \nrequirements, where compensation payments and support meet ADB\u2019s SPS requirements on \ninvoluntary resettlement; (ii) ensured participation of the affected households in the inventory of \nlosses and detailed measurement surveys; and (iii) provided avenues for the affected households \nto submit grievances. The audit also confirmed that Phong Huy and Phong Nguyen did not restrict \nhouseholds\u2019 access to collect non-timber forest products even though portions of modified \nprotection forest were converted for project use. Aside from land loss, Van Kieu ethnic minority \ncommunities are expected to experience limited adverse impacts because of an influx of laborers \nas well as safety, health, and security issues during construction and operation. The project did \nnot result in commercialization of sociocultural and traditional beliefs of the Van Kieu or any \nnatural resources located within customary land. The project will provide beneficial measures \nthrough employment opportunities and socioeconomic development. \n \n32.  To address the adverse impacts, share benefits, and promote opportunities to all affected \nhouseholds and Van Kieu communities, livelihood restoration and ethnic minority development \nplans  (LREMDPs)  were  prepared  for  Lien  Lap  and  Phong  Huy  and  an  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plan (EMDP) for Phong Nguyen. Meaningful consultations were conducted when \npreparing  these  plans  and  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  borrowers  will  further \n(i) complete the land acquisition for transmission line towers located outside the boundary of the \nLien Lap wind farm, following the principles of replacement cost and measures agreed during \nconsultation to minimize impacts to affected households; (ii) formalize measures to address \nimpacts on economically displaced households stated in the LREMDP; and (iii) turn over access \nroads upgraded by the project to the respective commune people\u2019s committee upon completion \nof construction. Prior to land take, an addendum to the LREMDP for Lien Lap will be prepared for \nthe  additional  households  affected  by  the  15  transmission  line  towers  outside  the  project \nboundary. The borrowers will prepare semi-annual E&S monitoring reports, and the lenders\u2019 E&S \nadvisor will conduct monitoring, mid-program, and post-evaluation audits.  \n \n33.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Only 17% of PCC1 and its subsidiaries\u2019 staff are \nfemale with few women in management (21% female), technical (9% female), and field roles (4% \nfemale). PCC1 does not have an anti-sexual harassment policy. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender  and  Development  (1998)  and  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  plan  for  priority  2 \n ", "8 \n(accelerating progress in gender equality),26 PCC1 has incorporated measures to promote gender \nequality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business. Key features of the gender action plan are \nas follows: (i) targets for female workers during construction and operation; (ii) an increase in the \nproportion of female managers; (iii) development of an anti-sexual harassment policy; (iv) training \nof staff on the new anti-sexual harassment policy; and (v) inclusion of women from the local \ncommunity, for the first time, in the company\u2019s training on wind power operation and management. \nPCC1 will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n34.  The  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.27 The borrowers will report semiannually to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. PCC1 will develop, implement, and \ncomply  with  human  resources  policies  and  procedures  and  conduct  regular  audits  on  the \nsubcontractors'  compliance  during  construction  and  operation.  The  implementation  of  the \nstakeholder  engagement  plan  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  ensure  meaningful \nengagement with affected people and will follow ADB\u2019s SPS requirements.28 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n35.  The borrowers and sponsors were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing international \nbest practice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. \nADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC.
