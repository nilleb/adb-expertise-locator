The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Access to Justice Program (AJP) \nloans, and advisory technical assistance (TA) in December 2001.1 The AJP is supporting five \ninterrelated  governance  objectives:  (i) providing  a  legal  basis  for  judicial,  policy,  and \nadministrative reforms; (ii) improving the efficiency, timeliness, and effectiveness of judicial and \npolice  services;  (iii) supporting  greater  equity  and  accessibility  in  justice  services  for  the \nvulnerable  poor;  (iv)  improving  predictability  and  consistency  between  fiscal  and  human \nresource allocation and the mandates of reformed judicial and police institutions at the federal, \nprovincial,  and  local  government  levels;  and  (v) ensuring  greater  transparency  and \naccountability in the performance of the judiciary, police, and administrative justice institutions.  \n \n2.  This  TA2  was  prepared  by  a  team  drawn  from  the  Government,  the  AJP  Program \nManagement  Unit  (PMU),  ADB,  and  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID). They supported a 2-week mission in May 2004 by a police reform expert \nto facilitate a final round of technical consultations with a range of district institutions and \nindividuals  including  district  mayors,  district  coordination  officers,  district  public  safety \ncommission  (PSC)  members,  citizen  police  liaison  committee  (CPLC)  members,  senior \nprovincial police officers, National Police Academy, and National Police Bureau officers and \nrepresentatives  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Justice  and  DFID.3  The  mission  also \nreceived  Government's  concurrence  with  the  goals,  purpose,  scope  and  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements and the terms of reference. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1, and a risk analysis and mitigation strategy in Appendix 2.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Vulnerability, justice, and entitlements are closely linked. Vulnerability is a function of \ninsecurity of access to key sets of material, social, political, and environmental assets. Justice is \na function of the relationship between institutions responsible for delivering entitlements (public \ngoods, rights, and services) predictably, affordably, and accountably; and the ability of citizens \nto secure and sustain their access to key sets of assets. In this context, the efforts to limit the \nvulnerability of the poor to the vagaries of systems of administrative, political, civil, and criminal \njustice are at least as important as macroeconomic performance in poverty reduction.  \n \n4.  The majority of poor people recognize that the state has responsibilities to provide \neffective and equitable public goods and services. In particular, the poor often perceive their \ninteractions with public safety agencies as increasing their vulnerability to erosion of household, \npolitical, civil, natural resource, and social assets. Globally, the impact of a brutal police force \nand a corrupt judiciary is identified by the poor far more often than is attended to in official \naccounts of indicators and causes of poverty focusing, for instance, on access to health or \neducation.4 These intermediating public safety and security institutions, particularly at the local \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Technical Review Report. Islamabad (available on request). \n4  This refers to global experience, as comparative research is only beginning in Pakistan. For instance, under a \nNational Reconstruction Bureau district survey of service providers, respondents consistently rate police lowest.  \n ", "2   \nlevel, are demoralizing for the poor, who already feel defenseless and unable to exert pressure \nfor improved performance.  \n \n5.  Rule of Law and Poverty. A large body of research suggests that weak property rights \namplify poverty. But the rule of law underpins more than property and contractual rights. In a \nsociety with up to 35% of the population assumed to be living in poverty and in effect unable to \naccess their entitlements through the administrative, judicial, or political systems, this inability to \nsecure property and contract manifests in and exacerbates lawlessness. Ironically, while the just \nand effective application of laws governing people's access to basic entitlements is highlighted \nin poor people's accounts of poverty, analysis of and support to institutions responsible for \ndelivery  of  this  primary  public  good  has  been  greatly  underplayed  in  externally  supported \ngovernment poverty reduction efforts.5 It is now acknowledged that unaccountable police forces \nweaken social cohesion, and greatly increase poor people's vulnerability in terms of access to \npublic services, economic livelihoods, and security. The disintegration of institutional checks and \nbalances on police action can lead to human rights abuse and exploitation. For instance, the \ncost of informal charges made by the police on the public is on average PRs30,000\u201335,000 per \nepisode.6 The extreme form of injustice affecting the poor is police harassment and extortion. \nPatronage can be solicited, but this often forces the poor to sell their assets, thus pushing them \nfurther into poverty. Since its creation under the Police Act of 1861, the predominant function of \nthe police has been simply to control.  \n \n6.  Declining  Professionalism  and  Lack  of  Public  Oversight.  Weak  incentive  and \nsanction systems and political interference have over time eroded the capacity of public safety \nagencies. Politicization has undermined police professionalism and weakened their capacity to \nserve the rule of law. An alliance between the local political elite, district administration, and \nformer  magistracy  (under  the  control  of  the  executive)  has  eroded  protection  under \nconstitutional and other legal rights. Recruitment based on political patronage or corruption has \nled to a grave loss of public confidence in the police; and made people, especially the poor, \nvulnerable  to  threats,  intimidation,  and  abuse  by  those  in  power.  Weak  social  cohesion, \ndeclining confidence in police, and inadequate police accountability severely undermine social \nregulation and public safety in Pakistan.  \n \n7.  Slow Implementation of Reforms. Supported by the AJP, Police Order 2002 (PO \n2002) is the most thorough reform achieved since the 1861 Police Act. The PO provides for \nsetting up (i) federal, provincial, and district PSCs to increase public oversight and police \naccountability; (ii) district criminal justice coordination committees (DCJCCs); and (iii) separation \nof watch and ward from investigation, and creation of an independent prosecution service. The \nresponsibilities of the district PSCs, with mandatory 33% representation of women, include \napproving the police plan, setting performance standards, and holding the district police chief \naccountable for performance against the plan. The pace of reforms since 2002 has been slow, \nlargely due to inadequate capacity and uncertainty surrounding the durability of the police \nreforms. Further, implementation of new institutions created under the PO 2002 and the local \ngovernment ordinances (LGOs) 2001 concerned with access to justice has also been slow due \nto strong resistance from the police and provincial elites. Nevertheless, substantial progress has \nbeen achieved in establishing the district PSCs, which now are functioning in 90% of districts of \nthe country. At this critical stage, the Government has expressed the need to learn lessons from \nintensive work in selected districts to assist in scaling up, with AJP support, across the country. \n                                                 \n5  The initiatives and recommendations under the AJP are incorporated in the current Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper, which is perhaps the first official recognition of the links between policing and poverty.  \n6  National Reconstruction Bureau. 2001.

The federal and provincial cabinets have approved gender reform action plans (GRAPs)7 \nto implement the Government\u2019s commitments on gender equality. GRAPs include a package of \nlegislative, political, administrative, and fiscal reforms. Reforms approved under the Punjab \nGRAP will be strengthened by creating linkages with ongoing police reforms. Special areas of \nfocus will be developing capacity of the female members of district PSCs, incorporating gender \nconcerns in policing plans, and advancing gender responsiveness in the police stations.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.    The TA goal is to improve access to justice and public safety through better policing for \npoor and vulnerable people, especially women, children, and minorities in Punjab. The purpose \nis to support PO 2002 implementation in four pilot districts of Punjab province, and develop a \nsafer and more secure environment based on respect for human rights and equitable access to \njustice through policing that is more responsive to the needs of the poor and vulnerable. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA has five outputs across three components. \n \n1.  Effective Community-Based Policing (Component 1) \n \n11.  Output 1. Quality investigations are undertaken in a timely and professional manner to \nfacilitate effective prosecution and adjudication of cases. This output involves the following \nactivities  in  four  districts  in  Punjab  province:  (i)  formulating  and  implementing  pilot  district \nstrategies (3 years), and annual work plan and budget for the effective separation of watch and \nward8  and  investigation;  (ii)  formulating  and  implementing  pilot  district  human  resource \ndevelopment plans and budget ensuring sufficient personnel trained in PO 2002, investigation \ntraining, training needs analysis, curriculum design and development, senior investigating officer \ntraining (including the management of investigations), watch and ward, community policing, \nhuman rights, gender, and local and special laws; (iii) strengthening district police inspectorate \nsystems, including formulation and implementation of performance management measures; (iv) \nestablishing a performance-based system of rewards and promotions, including amendment of \nthe annual confidential report/performance evaluation report system;9 (v) implementing a public \nawareness campaign about PO 2002, including revised police systems and procedures, and \npublic grievance redress procedures, and activities on prevention of crimes affecting women \nand vulnerable groups; (vi) developing basic forensic awareness training, including crime scene \npreservation, using modular competency-based packages that can be delivered to police in \nmodel stations; and (vii) establishing, resourcing, and supporting police forensic offices in pilot \ndistricts to provide basic forensic services. \n \n12.  Output 2. Community policing programs are implemented in selected stations in pilot \ndistricts,  and  include  (i)  formulating  and  implementing  strategies  for  increased  citizen \n                                                 \n7  GRAPs  are  action  plans  approved  by  the  governments  to  implement  Pakistan\u2019s  national  and  international \ncommitments to gender equity. At present GRAPs do not focus on judicial and police reforms but provide for \nprovincial strategies to address issues of gender justice to ensure flexibility. \n8 Watch and ward refers to the preventive and law enforcement functions of the police. \n9  During the Inception Mission, ADB and the Government will specify the precise nature of direct incentives for well-\nperforming police officers. \n ", "4   \nparticipation in the delivery of police services to ensure vulnerable sections enjoy equality of \naccess to quality police services and protection; (ii) formulating and implementing community \npolicing plans and consolidation in district policing plans; (iii) establishing mechanisms to ensure \nregular  consultation  with  civil  society  organizations  concerned  with  the  rights  of  the  poor, \nwomen,  and  vulnerable  groups;  (iv)  developing  the  awareness  of  members  of  institutions \ncreated under the PO 2002 and LGOs 2001 of community policing principles; (v) building the \ncapacity of female police in at least one model station in each pilot district; and (vi) developing \nstandard operating procedures for the model police station. \n \n2.  Effective Public Oversight Bodies (Component 2) \n \n13.  Output 3. Public oversight bodies are functioning effectively in pilot districts. This output \nfocuses on two key bodies, the district PSC and the DCJCC, and includes (i) establishing an \nadequately resourced and trained district PSC in each pilot district with agreed rules of business \nand  operating  procedures,  including  performance  monitoring  and  information  systems;  (ii) \nbuilding the capacity of the pilot district PSCs to facilitate a participatory process including civil \nsociety for the preparation of strategic (3-year) and annual policing plans, (iii) building the \ncapacity  of  the  DCJCCs  to  facilitate  a  participatory  process  including  civil  society  for  the \npreparation  of  strategic  (3-year)  and  annual  local  justice  policy,  (iv)  formulating  operating \nprocedures among the DCJCC member institutions, and (v) training DCJCC members on PO \n2002. \n \n14.  Output  4.  PO  2002  (district  PSCs,  DCJCCs)  and  LGO  2001  institutions  (Insaaf \ncommittees, Musalihat Anjuman, union council safety committees, citizen community boards) \nare  functionally  integrated  in  pilot  districts.  This  includes  (i)  formulating  and  implementing \nstrategies, procedures, and rules to enable effective and efficient engagement between the \ndistrict  police  officer  and  the  district  nazim  on  law  and  order  issues;  (ii)  reviewing  and \nrecommending measures to strengthen the regulation of police services through PO 2002 and \nLGOs  2001,  including  procedures  for  common  reporting  standards;  (iii)  formulating  and \nimplementing strategies, procedures, and rules for the efficient and effective enforcement of \nmunicipal  and  administrative  laws;  (iv)  formulating  and  implementing  an  integrated  district \ninformation system on crime and police services; and (v) strengthening the capacity of members \nof the PO and LGO citizen oversight institutions to effectively engage with the police in pilot \ndistricts. \n \n3.  Effective Policy Dialogue (Component 3) \n \n15.  Output 5. Lessons from the pilot project contribute to policy dialogue on national and \nprovincial police reforms. This includes (i) formulating and implementing a project performance \nmonitoring and evaluation system; (ii) commissioning baseline and ongoing research in pilot \ndistricts  and  police  stations;  (iii)  formulating  and  implementing  national  public  access  to \ninformation policy and public awareness campaign on the PO and reformed police systems and \nprocedures;  (iv)  analyzing  and  documenting  police  engagement  with  the  PO  and  LGO \ninstitutions and the criminal justice system; (v) holding workshops to review pilot lessons with \npolicymakers in the justice sector; (vi) devising a roll-out program for the remainder of the \nPunjab; (vii) developing a manual of guidance for implementing police reform in other provinces; \n(viii) commissioning research, analyzing, and proposing revisions to Police Rules 1934; (ix) \nestablishing  a  mechanism  for  sharing  lessons  learned  to  all  districts  in  Punjab;  and  (x) \nestablishing  mechanisms  to  depoliticize  the  police  to  bring  about  a  professional  and  non-\npartisan police force in the province. \n \n \n  ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,190,000 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange \ncost of $68,000 and local currency cost of $1,122,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, endorsed at a peer review meeting \nheld  in  Manila  in  June  2004.  ADB  will  administer  the  $950,000  of  TA  funds,  while  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  will  contribute  $240,000  equivalent  for  office  accommodation  and \ncounterpart staff support. Appendix 3 summarizes the cost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Planning and Development Department (P&DD), Government of the Punjab will be \nthe Executing Agency for the TA under the existing AJP implementation arrangements. The \nPunjab  Police  Department,  Home  Department,  and  National  Police  Bureau  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. The AJP PMU will support the TA activities ensuring coordination with \nongoing AJP program activities. P&DD will liaise closely with the director general, National \nPolice Bureau. The TA coordinator engaged under this TA will be responsible for overall day-to-\nday supervision in consultation with the AJP TA team leader. Quarterly TA review meetings, \nchaired by the chair P&DD/chair AJP provincial steering committee, will include consultants \nengaged under the TA and ADB, to review TA implementation progress, address issues that \nmay  arise,  and  guide  the  consultants.  The  performance  of  consultants  will  be  subject  to \nevaluation through the AJP annual performance review processes.  \n \n18.  TA  implementation  is  designed  on  the  following  principles:  (i)  appointment  of  four \nsuperintendents of police as focal persons in each TA district and agreement with the Punjab \nPolice Department to ensure that the focal persons will not be transferred from the district for at \nleast 12 months; (ii) provision of necessary office, logistics, and personnel support in the AJP \nPMU and the TA district offices; and (iii) assurance that the required information and data is \navailable to support TA implementation and promote public access to information about all \nrelevant aspects of TA implementation. \n \n19.  The  TA  is  scheduled  to  be  implemented  in  36  months,  from  December  2004  to \nDecember 2007. A team of 8 domestic consultants will provide 270 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services to P&DD and the implementing agencies. An international consultant (3 \nperson-months) will provide periodic peer reviews and guidance to the domestic consultants. \nADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The consultants recruited under the \nTA will report to the TA coordinator who will be responsible for their performance. Modifications \nto the scope, terms, and activities of consultants will be agreed jointly by the TA coordinator, \nAJP PMU, and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $950,000 to the Government \nof Pakistan to be
