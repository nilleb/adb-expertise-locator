INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will  build fiscal policy \nknowledge to promote green and  inclusive development\u2014advancing economic, social, and \nenvironmental objectives\u2014in developing Asia.  Under the TA, the Economic  Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) will carry out research on fiscal policy in collaboration \nwith leading experts, with findings disseminated to policymakers and other stakeholders. The TA \nwill complement ongoing work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in debt analytics;1 a regional \nhub on domestic resource mobilization and international tax cooperation;2 and tax transparency.3 \nThe TA closely aligns with ADB's Strategy 2030, in particular operational priority 6 (strengthening \ngovernance and  institutional capacity),  which includes components on enhancing domestic \nresource mobilization and improving public expenditure effectiveness.4 By supporting the funding \nand provision of public goods and services, the TA will contribute to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 vision \nof a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific. The TA is also aligned \nwith the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).5 The TA cluster is included in the current ADB \nManagement-approved annual work program of ERCD.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Inefficient and inadequate taxes and government expenditures in developing member \ncountries (DMCs) hinder the provision of education, health, social protection, and physical \ninfrastructure needed to promote green and inclusive development. The United Nations Economic \nand Social  Commission for Asia and the Pacific estimates that the region needs to invest \n$1.5 trillion annually from 2016 to 2030 to achieve the SDGs.7 Although private finance is crucial, \nmuch of this expenditure must be met by stronger tax revenue. Inadequate taxes also impede the \neffectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policy and increase reliance on costly finance. An inefficient \ntax mix can increase dependence on more distortive and growth-retarding taxes, worsen income \ndistribution, and hinder environmental and social policy objectives. \n  \n3.  Although some DMCs have made progress with tax revenue mobilization, their revenues \nremain considerably lower compared with advanced economies and many developing country \npeers.8 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated fiscal pressure, with \nrevenues falling sharply across the region because of the economic downturn and stimulus \nmeasures.9 Combined with higher spending, fiscal deficits have widened considerably. Across \ndeveloping Asia, between 2019 and 2020, the weighted average fiscal deficit rose from about \n5.0% of GDP to about 9.5% of GDP and government debt increased by 9.0 percentage points of \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

The \nTA also aligns with Operational Plan for Priority 2: Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality; and Operational Plan \nfor Priority 3: Tackling Climate Change, Building  Climate and Disaster Resilience, and Enhancing  Environmental \nSustainability.   \n5  Particularly SDG 17.1: Strengthening domestic resource mobilization, but also SDGs 16.7 and 12.c. \n6  The TA cluster first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 May 2021. \n7  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2019.

Exit Strategy to Ease or Eliminate  Tax Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Asian Development \nBank. Manila. \n ", "2 \nGDP.10 Although fiscal pressure should ease as  economies recover, the economic outlook \nremains uncertain and government balance sheets may remain weak for some time. \n \n4.  Several factors contribute to weak and inefficient tax revenues in DMCs. Large informal \nsectors mean that a large portion of economic activity falls outside the tax net and limit the \nparticipation in the fiscal activities across the population and entities. Tax incentives, a significant \nsource of tax leakage,  are prevalent across the region.11 Tax competition can promote an \nunhealthy race to the bottom. Although lower trade tariffs are beneficial for trade, globalization, \nand broader economic performance, they erode an important revenue source for some DMCs. \nAlthough the digital economy presents new economic opportunities, with significant growth \npotential,12 it also poses new taxation challenges, notably base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). \n \n5.  More  efficient government  expenditures can  complement  stronger  fiscal  revenue \nmobilization by increasing the impact of a given amount of spending. But significant expenditure \nhas little positive impact in promoting green and inclusive development.13 Some expenditures are \npoorly targeted, benefiting the relatively well off, while others deliver subpar returns. COVID-19 \nhas exposed inadequate DMC expenditure on social protection, health care, and other areas. \nFiscal  consolidation poses  a  major  medium-term  challenge  to  DMCs  and  heightens the \nimportance of improving spending efficiency. \n \n6.  Fiscal policy is one of the most politically challenging areas of public policy. Increasing \ntaxes or reducing public spending can be unpopular, and fiscal policy reforms in the broader \ninterests of society can be stymied by vested interests. Successful fiscal policy reform, therefore, \nrequires strong political buy-in. Knowledge products that provide fresh evidence of the benefits of \nsound fiscal policies can support policy dialogue and help mobilize support for reform in DMCs. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n7.  The TA project comprises two subprojects that will provide a fresh, holistic knowledge \nbase on fiscal policies for green and inclusive development to strengthen policy capacity in DMCs. \nThe TA cluster modality is appropriate because of the linked nature of the issues to be addressed, \nallowing for better sequencing of activities and for financing to be staggered. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n8.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: fiscal policy for green and inclusive \ndevelopment better leveraged in DMCs (footnote 4). The TA cluster will have the following \noutcome: knowledge on strengthening revenue mobilization, public expenditure effectiveness, \nand fiscal management enhanced.14 The TA will produce the following outputs to help DMCs \naddress core fiscal policy challenges as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n10 Asian Development Bank estimates using IMF Government Finance Statistics.  \n  https://www.imf.org/en/Data#imffinancial (accessed 14 April 2021). \n11 S.

Output 1: Research addressing revenue mobilization carried out. The TA team will \nassess the fiscal landscape, including the early impact of COVID-19, in DMCs. The team will also \nexamine fresh empirical evidence on the potential to generate tax revenues, and analyze sources \nof revenue weakness and priorities for strengthening existing taxes. The team will propose ways \nto optimize tax incentives by reviewing their fiscal cost and effectiveness, drawing on literature \nand tax incentives data. The analysis will examine the adverse revenue implications of large \ninformal sectors and options for bringing more of the informal sector into the tax net. Taxation of \nthe digital economy will be researched to examine the threat from BEPS and how this can be \naddressed through regional cooperation, building on the Group of Twenty (G20)/Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework on BEPS, and domestic reforms. \nThe merits and  feasibility of alternative taxes, including sin taxes and  environmental-fiscal \ninstruments, and  efficient taxation  to  phase  out  distortionary fossil-fuel subsidies, will  be \nassessed. The research will also delve into how tax policies can promote equity, considering \npotential efficiency and equity tradeoffs. This research will support preparation of the Asian \nDevelopment Outlook 2022 theme chapter. \n \n10.  Output 2: Research addressing government expenditure and fiscal management \ncarried out. Research under this output will examine options for improving DMC government \nexpenditures on education, health, social protection, environment, and infrastructure to promote \ngreen and inclusive development, including gender inclusion.15 The TA team will assess fiscal \npolicy frameworks for prioritizing and promoting efficient, equity-promoting expenditures; trust in \ngovernment; debt sustainability; and tax compliance. Additional research will cover strengthening \noverall fiscal management to help DMCs achieve medium-term fiscal consolidation as they \nemerge from COVID-19, encompassing fiscal scenarios, fiscal architecture reforms, and fiscal \ndiagnosis. \n \n11.  The research will be prepared in collaboration with leading scholars. Innovative research \nmethods will be explored, drawing on the latest empirical approaches and insights from emerging \nfields such as behavioral public finance. Given the political challenges associated with fiscal policy \nreform, the TA will examine lessons from successful reforms for DMCs. Papers will be published \nas working papers or standalone chapters in a collective volume. The findings of the studies will \nalso be disseminated through policy briefs, blogs, and op-eds. The products will mostly be shared \nelectronically via ADB websites. Printed copies of the papers and the collective volume will be \nprovided to policymakers and other stakeholders based on demand. \n \n12.  Output 3: ADB online fiscal content enhanced, and Asia Fiscal Monitor published. \nTo improve awareness of DMC fiscal challenges, the TA team will create and disseminate through \nexisting ADB portals or the new Asia Fiscal Online sub-portal a range of new fiscal research \n(including from outputs 1 and 2), analysis, and commentary. This online content will include key \nnew fiscal indicators, building on the ADB COVID-19 Policy Database initiative.16 This will include \nfiscal diagnostics developed using empirical analysis  to monitor evolving fiscal stances and \nvulnerabilities in DMCs. Alternative communication channels will be explored to reach a broader \naudience and make it easier to retrieve information and data. The portal will also feature a new \nannual publication with a strong regional focus: Asia Fiscal Monitor (AFM). AFM will provide an \naccessible snapshot of regional fiscal developments, highlight topical fiscal research focusing on \nchallenges facing DMCs, and present updated fiscal diagnostics for DMCs. The fiscal online \ncontent generated under output 3 and  the AFM will  complement existing publications and \n \n15 Related fiscal analyses recognizing unpaid domestic and household works in the context of informal sectors, and \nfemale labor force participation. \n16 This ADB database tracks government policies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (https://covid19policy.adb.org/) . \n ", "4 \ndatabases through a region-centric approach. Thus, the TA cluster will help fill in fiscal data gaps, \nprovide an improved platform for analysis of fiscal challenges across DMCs, and strengthen ADB \ncoverage of fiscal issues. As part of the TA review process, an  assessment will be made \nconcerning future arrangements, including funding, for the enhanced online content and the AFM. \n \n13.  Output 4: Knowledge sharing on fiscal policy strengthened. To leverage research \noutputs and build capacity in DMCs, outreach events will be held in collaboration with relevant \nADB departments and stakeholders. An annual regional conference will be held to bring together \nleading researchers, policymakers, and other experts to provide fresh perspectives on fiscal policy \nchallenges and solutions, including best practices. The conference will provide a forum for sharing \ncountry experiences to foster cross-fertilization of ideas. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $1,300,000 ($300,000 for subproject 1 and $1,000,000 \nfor subproject 2), which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-7 and TASF-other sources). Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will \nbe presented for each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  cluster with  ERCD  responsible for administration  and \nsupervision,  management  of  consultants,  procurement, and  accomplishment  of  outputs. \nPromoting the One ADB approach in knowledge solutions, ERCD will coordinate with regional \ndepartments, including resident missions and Sustainable and Development and Climate Change \ndepartment, to promote synergies across ADB online fiscal content and knowledge products. A \nno-objection letter will be obtained prior to commencing any undertaking in a DMC. Each TA \nsubproject proposal will be submitted for approval to the ERCD chief economist and director \ngeneral, following the business process for knowledge and support TA cluster processing.17 \nSubproject  activities  will  start  only  after  the  approval  of  each  TA  subproject proposal. \nImplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2021\u2013December 2024 (TA cluster); July 2021\u2013September 2022 \nfor the TA cluster  (subproject 1); and July 2022\u2013December 2024 (subproject 2)  \nExecuting and implementing  ADB, Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department, \nagency  EROD-ERMR \nConsultantsa  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by \nIndividual: International  Individual consultant  ADB \nexpertise  selectionb \nIndividual: National  Individual consultant  ADB \nexpertise  selectionb \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERMR = Macroeconomics Research Division, EROD = Office of the Chief Economist \nand Director General, TA = technical assistance. \na  Terms of reference for consultants, including resource persons will be included in the subprojects. \nb  Framework contracts will be  considered.
