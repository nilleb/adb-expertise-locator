During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Tonga requested \nsupport from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a technical assistance (TA) to speed up \nthe reform  process of government commercial activities, especially public enterprises. The \nreform  is  an  important  element  of  the  comprehensive  economic  and  public  sector  reform \nprogram (EPSRP) initiated in 2001. \n \n2.  The EPSRP has been supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies, including \nADB. ADB provided a program loan of $10 million in support of reform measures in public \nfinance and the public service.1 Some assistance has been provided by New Zealand Agency \nfor International Development (NZAID)2 in recent years to create a database of public enterprise \nfinancial information and to conduct ad hoc reviews. The Government, however, wished to \naccelerate reforms in state-owned enterprises to reduce the increasing subsidy burden on the \nbudget and, where appropriate, to transfer some of these enterprises and activities to the \nprivate sector. The TA was included in the approved 2002 country strategy program update \n(CSPU).3 The initial fact-finding mission was carried out from 2 to 5 December 2002. The \nGovernment confirmed the rationale and scope of the TA. The TA framework is presented in \nAppendix 1.4  \n     \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The initiation of the comprehensive EPSRP in 2001 was the result of extensive policy \ndialogue between the Government and ADB since 1998. The EPSRP aims to enhance private-\nsector-led economic growth by (i) promoting policies that create an environment conducive to \nincreased investment and employment by the private sector, and (ii) improving the efficiency \nand effectiveness of service delivery by the public sector. The EPSRP program loan focuses on \nimproving fiscal balance, restructuring government operations, and mitigating the social and \neconomic  impact  of  public  expenditure  adjustment.  However,  the  reforms  relating  to \nrationalization of public enterprises are yet to be adequately advanced.    \n \n4.  Since 1999, NZAID has assisted the Government to address a number of matters: \nestablishing the Overarching Investment Policies applicable to public enterprises, which was \napproved  by  the  Privy  Council,  creating  a  database  of  information  on  public  enterprises' \nfinancial  performance;  liquidation  of  nontrading  public  enterprises,  ad  hoc  reviews  and \ncorporatization  of  selected  enterprises;  and  other  financial  policy  issues  as  appropriate. \nCurrently 13 public enterprises are subject to the Public Enterprises Act 2002 and around 8 \ncommercial activities are undertaken within government departments. The Public Enterprises \nAct 2002 was enacted in November 2002 as part of the assistance provided under the EPSRP \nloan.  However,  progress  with  public  enterprise  reforms  has  been  slow  compared  with \nexperience in neighboring Pacific developing member countries.  \n \n5.  In December 1995, the Privy Council5 required the Minister for Finance to submit a \nproposal for a complete review of all government investments with a view to securing adequate \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n4  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 10 February 2003. \n5  The Privy Council is the highest executive authority in Tonga comprising the Cabinet and chaired by the King of \nTonga. ", "2 \ndividend payments. The Government Investment Unit (GIU) was established within the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) in July 1999 to monitor public enterprise performance. NZAID has supported \nthis  unit  with  TA,  which  has  resulted  in  all  nontrading  public  enterprises  being  closed  or \nprepared for closure, and a number of departmental commercial activities corporatized. The \napproved Overarching Investment Policies statement includes broad principles on investment \nand  divestment  objectives.  The  statement  needs  to  be  supported  by  detailed  criteria  and \nguidelines to provide a consistent framework for operational decision-making and monitoring \npurposes. With NZAID assistance, policy papers to establish a monitoring framework were \nprepared, but Government approval has proved difficult to achieve.  The GIU has inadequate \nresources and skills to provide policy support to the minister and Cabinet in the more complex \naspects of public enterprise reforms. Assistance is therefore needed to push the reform effort in \nthis area as improved performance by public enterprises will reduce the subsidies that drain the \never decreasing public finances.    \n \n6.  Although information on the financial position of individual public enterprises is being \ncollected, financial performance of public enterprise has not been analyzed systematically due \nto the inadequate skills of GIU staff and absence of a financial monitoring framework. A list of \npublic enterprises and departmental commercial activities that will be the subject of the TA is in \nAppendix 2. Most public enterprises have never paid dividend to the Government. Generally, \npublic enterprises have higher salary structures than the public service and collectively employ \naround 1,200 people. Although the Government completed privatization of the generation and \ndistribution of electricity in Tongatapu in early 2002 and has allowed some competition in \ntelecommunications (internet access and mobile telephone), no regulatory framework exists to \nprotect the public interest through affordable services and competition. \n \n7.  The Public Enterprises Act 2002 recognizes the need for public enterprise reforms but \nthe  intent  of  the  act  now  needs  to  be  translated  into  a  concrete,  comprehensive  policy \nframework  (including  regulations  to  ensure  appropriate  and  affordable  competition)  and  a \ndetailed time-bound action plan. Constraints to privatization include, among other things, the \nlack of a clear policy to determine the kind of activities that the Government should be involved \nin  and  those  that  should  be  transferred  to  the  private  sector.  Moreover,  the  Government \ncontinues  to  engage  in  risky  operations  that  are  intended  to  make  up  for  the  perceived \ndeficiencies of the private sector and/or protect the national interest. Further, these decisions \nhave not been made in a transparent manner or within a framework that ensures adequate \nmanagement of the Government\u2019s exposure to commercial risks.   \n \n8.   The legal status of government commercial activities varies widely. While certain public \nenterprises are corporatized pursuant to applicable company law or under a special law or \nstatute, others operate as proprietary or revolving funds or are run as part of government \ndepartments. While some statutes address competition and regulatory issues to protect the \npublic  interest,  others  do  not.  Such  statutes  should  be  reviewed  and  remedial  measures \nrecommended to ensure a coherent legal framework that facilitates regulation, restructuring, \ncorporate governance, and privatization. \n \n9.  The  Government  is  committed  to  further  the  process  of  public  enterprise  reforms. \nBuilding  upon  the  assistance  provided  by  ADB  and  NZAID  under  previous  TAs,  such \ncommitment now needs to be supported through a focused advisory TA to speed the reform \nprocess by preparing a coherent policy and regulatory framework and a time-bound action plan.         \n ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to assist the Government to implement the public enterprise \nreform envisaged under the Public Enterprise Act 2002. The TA will assist the Government to (i) \nformulate  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  including  competition  and  regulatory \narrangements, (ii) review all existing government commercial investments and activities, and (iii) \nprepare a sequenced set of processes and a timetable for implementing public enterprise \nreforms. Such reforms will be an integral part of the broader public sector reforms initiated under \nthe EPSRP. The public enterprise reforms will also provide impetus to improve efficiency and \nfinancial  performance  of  public  enterprises  through  (i)  introducing  clear  accountability  of \nministers, boards of directors, and chief executives; and (ii) operational and financial autonomy \nfor management and better business practices.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will include the following key components: \n   \n(i)  assistance to the Government in defining the \u201cpublic interest\u201d criteria to guide \ndecisions on rationalization and privatization, and prepare a detailed action plan \nto restructure/privatize public enterprises and government commercial activities \nas appropriate; \n \n(ii)  advice on the formulation of a competition and regulatory policy framework for \npublic enterprise reforms; \n \n(iii)  detailed  technical  advice  on  rationalization  or  privatization  of  selected  public \nenterprises including corporate and financial restructuring, asset valuation, legal \nstatus, taxation treatment, regulatory arrangements, and associated labor issues; \n \n(iv)  advice on strengthening management of individual public enterprises that are to \nremain under majority government ownership in the short/medium term, as well \nas specific proposals for improved performance; \n \n(v)  capacity building of the GIU; and  \n \n(vi)  advice on consensus building and increasing awareness of stakeholders about \nissues related to public enterprise reforms. \n   \n12.  The  consultants  are  expected  to  provide  a  comprehensive  set  of  policy \nrecommendations on public enterprise reforms, and help selected enterprises to take steps \nneeded to implement the Government\u2019s policies on rationalization/privatization. The consultants \nwill (i) prepare a brief policy paper setting out \u201cthe public interest\u201d criteria to guide government \ndecisions on whether an investment should remain under public ownership; (ii) review and \nanalyze the business and financial position of public enterprises and government commercial \nactivities, and assess the readiness of each public enterprise for restructuring/privatization; (iii) \nrecommend  a  timetable,  and  procedures,  for  implementing  the  reforms;  (iv)  prepare  a \nperformance  monitoring  framework  for  public  enterprises;  (v)  initiate  a  public  awareness \nstrategy; and (vi) prepare a carefully sequenced action plan for rationalization and privatization \nfor approval by Government. The consultants will also provide strategic intervention to help ", "4 \nimplement the restructuring program and assess overall funding needs for implementation of the \naction plan.       \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $640,000, including a foreign exchange cost of \n$515,000 and $125,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $515,000 covering \nthe entire foreign exchange cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will contribute $125,000 equivalent of the local currency cost through \nprovision of office space, adequate counterpart staff including legal staff for the drafting of \nregulations, local transportation, workshops, seminars and other services. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  in  close  coordination  with  other \ndepartments that support the responsible minister in supervising and monitoring performance of \npublic enterprises. The consultants will work closely with staff of the GIU and the NZAID \nconsultant.  MOF  will  ensure  timely  access  to  all  relevant  information  related  to  public \nenterprises. A public enterprise reform steering committee will be established and chaired by \nMOF  to  provide  guidance  on  TA  implementation  and  act  as  a  forum  for  information \ndissemination to affected agencies and stakeholders.        \n \n15.  A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged through a firm. The \nconsultants will be selected through the quality and cost-based selection method with simplified \ntechnical proposals in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The team will \ninclude the following international and domestic consultants for a total of approximately 18 \nperson-months:  (i)  a  public  enterprise  reform  expert;  (ii)  specialists  with  experience  in \ncorporatization and privatization in telecommunication, electricity, water and shipping; (iii) a \nfinancial  analyst  and  adviser;  and  (iv)  a  communication  adviser  with  experience  in  the \nparticipatory process and public information campaigns. The communication adviser will be \nrecruited internationally if a qualified domestic consultant is not available. The team will also \nwork closely with the financial analyst provided under an NZAID assistance program to GIU. \nThe consultants will closely collaborate with other externally funded consultants related to public \nsector reforms to achieve maximum utilization of resources and avoid duplication of efforts. The \nconsultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.  \n \n16.  The consultants will prepare an inception report, brief monthly progress reports, a draft \nfinal report, and a final report. The draft final report, with detailed proposals for rationalization \nand privatization, and an action plan will be discussed at a consultative meeting comprising \nADB, the MOF steering committee, and the consultants. Detailed reporting requirements are \noutlined in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months. It is expected to commence in \nJuly 2003 and be completed by June 2004. Within 4 weeks after the commencement of the TA, \nthe  consultants  will  submit  a  brief  inception  report  summarizing  the  current  status  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s public enterprise reform program; identifying specific issues; suggesting changes \nto the methodology and program, if any; and detailing a work program to achieve the agreed \noutputs.  Monthly  progress  reports  will  be  discussed  with  the  TA  implementation  steering \ncommittee to ensure actions are taken to minimize delays to the achievement of milestones. ", "    5 \nThe consultants will submit the draft final report for comments by ADB and the implementation \nsteering committee. A tripartite meeting among the Government, ADB and the consultants will \ndiscuss the draft final report and any changes to be made. Subsequently, and within 1 month of \nthe  tripartite  meeting,  the  consultants  will  submit  the  final  report  incorporating  comments \nreceived as appropriate. The consultants will submit three hard copies and an electronic version \n(compact disc) of all reports to ADB and the Government.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The  President,  acting  under  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $515,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for the Rationalization of Public Enterprises, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n    ", " \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n6\n \n \n \n        A\n  Performance    Assumptions  pp\nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms  e\nIndicators/Targets  and Risks  nd\n      ix\n 1\nGoal         \nBetter resource allocation and  Reduction of budget subsidies  Annual budgets. \neconomic efficiency in the  to public enterprises by at \npublic sector.  least 50% by fiscal year 2006. \n \nPurpose       \n1.
