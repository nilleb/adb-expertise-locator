The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested Bank\nadvisory technical assistance (TA) to improve its capability for water resources management in\nthe Red River Basin. An understanding was reached with the Government on the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference during TA Fact-\nfindin in April 1997. The proposed TA is included in the Bank's 1997 TA program for Viet\nNam.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The rapid pace of development in Viet Nam presents significant challenges to\nthe management of its natural resources. The economic reform program introduced in the late\n1980s has promoted increased agricultural production, fostered industrial growth, and laid the\nfoundation for sustained economic development. The country is expected to move from an\nagricultural base to one that is more urban and industrial, accompanied by rising real incomes\nand improved living standards. The population will almost double over the next three decades.\nThese changes will place enormous pressures on the country's natural resources, and\nmanaging water resources effectively will become increasingly important, A water resources\nsector review undertaken jointly by the Bank,2 World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization,\nUnited Nations Development Programme and nongovernment organizations has highlighted\nthe challenges, including dry season water shortages, salinity intrusion, flooding, deteriorating\nwater quality, land use changes, and rapidly increasing municipal and industrial demand.\n3. Addressing these challenges will require a strong institutional framework. At\npresent, however, the agencies involved in water resources management have roles and\nresponsibilities that are neither clearly defined nor comprehensive. 3 Coordination and\ncommunication among agencies are weak, decision-making tends to focus on single purpose\nsubsectoral objectives, and inaccessibility to water-related data hampers decision making. The\nGovernment recognizes these shortcomings, and an initial step in its response has been to\nintroduce a water law. The main provisions of the draft water law are (i) to establish the basic\npolicies and principles for water resources development and management; (ii) to enable\nunified administrative and management organizations based on hydrological boundaries; and\n(iii) to promote cooperation, communication, and coordination among Government ministries\nand agencies, water users, and the public. Support for finalizing the draft water law for\nsubmission to the National Assembly in early 1998 is being provided by the World Bank.\n4. Of particular significance in the Government's strategy is the commitment that\nthe river basin should be the primary basis for water resources management and that an\nintegrated approach will be adopted within each basin. This focus is fully consistent with the\nBank's emerging policy on the water sector.4 The Government has identified three major\nbasins to be priority areas for this approach: the Red River Basin, including Hanoi and\nHaiphong; the Dong Nai Basin, which includes Ho Chi Minh City; and the Mekong Basin. The\nGovernment has requested Bank support for improving water resources management in the\n1\t\nThe proposed TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 1996.\n2\t\nTA No. 2167-VIE:Water Resources Sector Review, l'or $99,500, approved on 26 September 1994.\nSectoral interests of irrigation and drainage, municipal and industrial water supply, hydropower generation,\nriver transport, and land management are represented by separate central agencies, and this structure is\ngenerally replicated at provincial level.\nTowards Effective Water Policy in the Asian and Pacific Region, ADB 1996.", "2\nRed River Basin in view of its importance to the capital region and the northern economic\ngrowth zone, and because of the Bank's history of assistance in the area.1\n5. The Red River rises in the mountains of Yunnan Province in the Peoples\nRepublic of China (PRC) and flows through Viet Nam to the South China Sea, where it forms\nan extensive delta. Its total catchmertt area is 169,000 square kilometers, of which 51 percent\nlies in Viet Nam, 48 percent in the PRC, and less than 1 percent in Lao Peoples Democratic\nRepublic. The climate is tropical to sub-tropical and is dominated by the east-Asia monsoon.\nSeasonal variation of rainfall is significant, with only about 10 percent of the annual total\noccurring during the dry season from November to March. Consequently, the basin discharge\nis highly variable from a minimum recorded dry season discharge of 370 cubic meters per\nsecond (m3Is), to a maximum of 38000 m3/s.\n6. The Basin has a population of about 24 million people, of whom 17 million live in\nthe Delta, making it one of the most densely populated rural areas in the world. The cultivated\narea in the Basin is close to 2 million hectares (ha), of which 650,000 ha is irrigated and\n880,000 ha is covered by drainage systems. Floods are a major problem, both in the Delta,\nwhere river and coastal flooding occur, and in the steep upland catchments, where land use\nchanges and deforestation have intensified flood runoff. There are two major hydropower\ndams in the Basin, and plans for further hydropower developments are being prepared. The\nHoa Birth Dam on the Da River currently meets almost 80 percent of the electricity supply of\nnorthern Viet Nam, while also contributing to low flow augmentation and flood peak reduction.\nIn the urban sector, major investments are needed in municipal water supply, drainage,\nwastewater disposal, and sanitation to keep pace with rapid urban and industrial expansion.\nProtection of groundwater quality from pollution and management of salinity intrusion are also\ncritical issues. Transport of freight by river will continue to be important, but is restricted durinq\nthe dry season, when low river flows are further reduced by abstractions for irrigation.\nSignificant pollution of the Basin's water resources has resulted from industrial development,\nand from rapid urban expansion. Pollution of village water sources is also widespread due to\nreturn flows from small-scale local industry, poor sanitation, and increased application of\npesticides.3\n7. As the competition among water users increases, the cross-sectoral impacts of\nmanagement decisions will become increasingly significant to the Basin's future prosperity.\nThe consequence of retaining the status quo is increasing conflict over resource allocation and\ndeteriorating water quality, which will disproportionately affect the lives of the rural poor and\nrequire significant financial resources to rectify. These trends have been recognized by the\nGovernment, and steps towards more integrated water resources management have been\ninitiated. Basin management and coordination across sectors and administrative units are key\naspects of the draft water law. Numerous institutional and administrative models for river basin\nmanagement exist, but adaptations will be required to suit Viet Nam's economic, political,\ninstitutional, socioeconomic, and physical environment. Consensus building among agencies\nwill be essential to achieve commitment to the new policies. The proposed TA is consistent\nwith the Bank's Medium-term Strategic Framework in its approach to institutional strengthening\nand in providing a foundation for subsequent capacity-building activities.\nLoan No. 1259-VIE:lrngation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation, for $76500 million, approved on 26\nOctober 1993; and Loan No. 1344-V1E:Red River Delta Water Resources Sector, for $60.00 million,\napproved on 13 December 1994.\nRecommendations for improvement in river transport routes in the Basin are being prepared under TA No.\n2615-VIE:Red River Waterways, for $980,000, approved on 24 July 1996.\nWater Environment Survey of Two Red River Delta Irrigation Schemes, January 1997 under TA No. 2233-\nVIE: Capacity Building in the Water Resources Sector.", "3\nIll.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The overall sector goal to which the proposed TA will contribute is improved\nmanagement of water resources in the Red River Basin, which reflects national development\ngoals, promotes sustairiability of the water environment, and is responsive to rapidly changing\ndemands. The proposed TA is the first step in improving the Government's capability for\nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) 1 in the Basin, and aims to develop a more\nappropriate policy and institutional framework, increase understanding of the issues facing the\nBasin, and provide a sound basis for future management interventions.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The scope of the proposed TA covers support in three areas: (i) development of\na policy and effective institutional framework for IWRM in the Basin; 2 (ii) development of a\nwater sector information system that focuses on the changing demands, hydrology, and land\nuse; and (iii) priority studies addressing key functions of JWRM and the resolution of a set of\ncritical water resources problems.\nPolicy and Institutional Framework\n10. As an interim arrangement to guide the process of establishing a river basin\norganization (RBO), the Government will establish a Red River Basin Strategy Committee,\nwhich will (i) prepare a policy statement on IWRM in the Basin and submit it for Government\nadoption, (ii) develop the institutional framework within which the RBO and the line agencies\nwill operate and submit it to Government for approval, (iii) identify the powers required by the\nRBO and necessary implementing arrangements, and (iv) guide the process of establishing\nthe RBO. Consultation with stakeholders at the provincial and district levels will be promoted\nthrough workshops and the establishment of a water sector network. 3 Senior policy makers will\nundertake study visits to two countries in the Region in relation to IWRM.\n2.\t Red River Basin Information System\n11. An Information System will be initiated as a key resource for water management\nby the RBO and the line agencies. Activities will comprise (i) preparation of a River Basin\nProfile detailing issues, problems, and opportunities in water and land resources management;\n(ii) compilation of a Water Resources Data Directory 4 (WRDD); (iii) assessment of the\nadequacy of existing data on surface water, groundwater, water quality, sedimentation, and\nland use; (iv) assessment of the capabilities of existing geographic information systems (GIS)\nand recommendations for integration of data; (v) development of a GIS to support the River\nBasin Profile, the WRDD, and training in its use; and (vi) recommendations for appropriate\nThe relevant sectors include irrigation; drainage; flood management; hydropower, urban, rural, and\nindustrial supply: sanitation, navigation; fisheries and other ecological requirements: and land\nmanagement.\n2 \nThe TA will focus on the area of the Basin within Viet Nam, namely the catch rnents of the Da, Red, Chay,\nLa and Thai Binh Rivers. It is proposed that appropriate contacts with the Government of the PRC will be\nmade during TA implementation to promote cooperation in Basin management.\nA computer system developed under UNDP Project VIE/93/031 will be operational in all provinces in the\nBasin by January 1998, and will be utilized for the water sector network.\nA computerized database containing information about existing datasets, reports and information.", "4\nsurface water and groundwater models, decision support systems, and other predictive and\nmanagement tools.\n3.\t Management Studies and Pilot Improvements\n12. At least three specific studies related to introducing IWRM in the Basin will be\ncarried out based on priorities identified in the River Basin Profile and deliberations of the\nCommittee. The studies selected will relate to at least one of the following (i) increasing\nunderstanding of the natural processes affecting water resources management, (ii)\ndevelopment of detailed procedures for implementing components of IWRM, and (iii) capacity\nbuilding. Sample studies include (i) the approach to licensing water extractions in the light of\ncurrent and projected water demands, (ii) a review of projected land use changes and their\nimpact on water resources management, and (iii) a strategy for community participation.\n13. Implementation of at least two pilot water management initiatives will be\nfacilitated through the auspices of Committee members. The aim is to resolve existing areas of\nconflict or competition that are not being addressed due to lack of coordination. Candidate\nissues will be agreed upon by the Committee. Two examples are (I) optimization of flood\ncontrol, irrigation, and hydropower operating rules for the main reservoirs, and (ii) reduction in\nriver pollution at Viet Tn. The benefits of IWRM in resolving such issues will be quantified.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan'\n14. The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $1,255,000 equivalent,\ncomprising $845,200 in foreign exchange cost and $409,800 equivalent in local currency cost.\nThe Bank will finance $1,150,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $304,800\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute the balance of the local\ncurrency cost of $105,000 equivalent through the provision of experienced counterpart staff,\nallowances, office accommodation, administrative services, data collation, and use of the\ncomputer network. The proposed TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Details of the cost estimates and\nfinancing plan are given in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n15. The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 27 months, commencing in\nJanuary 1998, and is divided into two phases. The initial phase of nine months will cover drafting\nand review of the policy statement on IWRM, preparing the River Basin Profile, and defining the\nscope of water resource management functions. The second phase will cover redefining functional\nresponsibilities, developing the information system, undertaking management studies and pilot\nimprovements, and establishing the RBO. A tirm of international consultants, in association with\ndomestic consultants, will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. It is envisaged that a total of 58 person-months of consulting services\nwill be required, comprising 28 person-months of international and 32 person-months of\ndomestic consultants. The international consultants will comprise specialists in water resources\nplanning, policy and institutional reform, GIS and data management, water licensing, and water\nquality. The domestic consultants will comprise a water resources advisor, water policy advisor\nand specialists in GIS, water quality, and land use.

It is expected that there will be a one-month interval between the two\nphases. The outhne terms of reference are given in Appendix 2.\n16. In view of its mandate for water resources management, the Executing Agency\nfor the proposed TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).' The\nProject Director will be a Vice Minister of MARD, and the Project Manager will be the Director\nof the Department of Water Resources Management (DWRM). To assist the process of\ntransition to an RBO that is independent of line agency responsibilities, a Vice Minister of the\nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will chair the Strategy Committee and be\nresponsible for liaison with policy makers of other concerned agencies for this component.\nMembers of the Committee will comprise representatives at the Vice Minister level from each\nof the central ministries and agencies in the water sector. The Committee will meet at key\ndecision stages to (i) review drafts of the policy statement, (ii) review water resources\nmanagement functions, and (iii) reach agreement on the new institutional framework and\nresponsibilities. At least two tripartite reviews will be held to coincide with Committee meetings\nat stages (i) and (iii). DWRM will be the Secretariat to the Committee, and the Consultant's\npolicy specialist will liaise directly with the Chairman of the Committee and the Project Director.\n17. To support the Committee, a Working Group comprising participants from\napproximately 25 central and provincial agencies will be established. 2 The composition of the\nWorking Group will be ratified at the first meeting of the Committee. With inputs from the\nconsultants, the Working Group will prepare the draft policy statement on 1WRM and draft the\nRiver Basin Profile. It will also provide feedback on working papers prepared by the\nconsultants on the new institutional framework.\n18. The following reports will be produced under the proposed TA: (i) an inception\nreport including an outline for the policy statement two months after mobilization, (ii) the River\nBasin Profile after six months, (iii) the final draft policy statement after nine months, (iv)\nprogress reports after 12 and 19 months, (v) a draft final report after 24 months, and (vi) the\nfinal report three months later. Assurances provided by the Government are (i) to establish the\nCommittee at the Vice Minister level prior to contract negotiations with the consultants, (ii) to\nestablish the Working Group within two months of the consultants' mobilization, (iii) to make\navailable existing data and reports, and (iv) to ensure timely review of draft policies and\nrecommendations of the Committee.\nIV.

The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested Bank\nadvisory technical assistance (TA) to improve its capability for water resources management in\nthe Red River Basin. An understanding was reached with the Government on the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference during TA Fact-\nfindin in April 1997. The proposed TA is included in the Bank's 1997 TA program for Viet\nNam.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The rapid pace of development in Viet Nam presents significant challenges to\nthe management of its natural resources. The economic reform program introduced in the late\n1980s has promoted increased agricultural production, fostered industrial growth, and laid the\nfoundation for sustained economic development. The country is expected to move from an\nagricultural base to one that is more urban and industrial, accompanied by rising real incomes\nand improved living standards. The population will almost double over the next three decades.\nThese changes will place enormous pressures on the country's natural resources, and\nmanaging water resources effectively will become increasingly important, A water resources\nsector review undertaken jointly by the Bank,2 World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization,\nUnited Nations Development Programme and nongovernment organizations has highlighted\nthe challenges, including dry season water shortages, salinity intrusion, flooding, deteriorating\nwater quality, land use changes, and rapidly increasing municipal and industrial demand.\n3. Addressing these challenges will require a strong institutional framework. At\npresent, however, the agencies involved in water resources management have roles and\nresponsibilities that are neither clearly defined nor comprehensive. 3 Coordination and\ncommunication among agencies are weak, decision-making tends to focus on single purpose\nsubsectoral objectives, and inaccessibility to water-related data hampers decision making. The\nGovernment recognizes these shortcomings, and an initial step in its response has been to\nintroduce a water law. The main provisions of the draft water law are (i) to establish the basic\npolicies and principles for water resources development and management; (ii) to enable\nunified administrative and management organizations based on hydrological boundaries; and\n(iii) to promote cooperation, communication, and coordination among Government ministries\nand agencies, water users, and the public. Support for finalizing the draft water law for\nsubmission to the National Assembly in early 1998 is being provided by the World Bank.\n4. Of particular significance in the Government's strategy is the commitment that\nthe river basin should be the primary basis for water resources management and that an\nintegrated approach will be adopted within each basin. This focus is fully consistent with the\nBank's emerging policy on the water sector.4 The Government has identified three major\nbasins to be priority areas for this approach: the Red River Basin, including Hanoi and\nHaiphong; the Dong Nai Basin, which includes Ho Chi Minh City; and the Mekong Basin. The\nGovernment has requested Bank support for improving water resources management in the\n1\t\nThe proposed TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 1996.\n2\t\nTA No. 2167-VIE:Water Resources Sector Review, l'or $99,500, approved on 26 September 1994.\nSectoral interests of irrigation and drainage, municipal and industrial water supply, hydropower generation,\nriver transport, and land management are represented by separate central agencies, and this structure is\ngenerally replicated at provincial level.\nTowards Effective Water Policy in the Asian and Pacific Region, ADB 1996.", "2\nRed River Basin in view of its importance to the capital region and the northern economic\ngrowth zone, and because of the Bank's history of assistance in the area.1\n5. The Red River rises in the mountains of Yunnan Province in the Peoples\nRepublic of China (PRC) and flows through Viet Nam to the South China Sea, where it forms\nan extensive delta. Its total catchmertt area is 169,000 square kilometers, of which 51 percent\nlies in Viet Nam, 48 percent in the PRC, and less than 1 percent in Lao Peoples Democratic\nRepublic. The climate is tropical to sub-tropical and is dominated by the east-Asia monsoon.\nSeasonal variation of rainfall is significant, with only about 10 percent of the annual total\noccurring during the dry season from November to March. Consequently, the basin discharge\nis highly variable from a minimum recorded dry season discharge of 370 cubic meters per\nsecond (m3Is), to a maximum of 38000 m3/s.\n6. The Basin has a population of about 24 million people, of whom 17 million live in\nthe Delta, making it one of the most densely populated rural areas in the world. The cultivated\narea in the Basin is close to 2 million hectares (ha), of which 650,000 ha is irrigated and\n880,000 ha is covered by drainage systems. Floods are a major problem, both in the Delta,\nwhere river and coastal flooding occur, and in the steep upland catchments, where land use\nchanges and deforestation have intensified flood runoff. There are two major hydropower\ndams in the Basin, and plans for further hydropower developments are being prepared. The\nHoa Birth Dam on the Da River currently meets almost 80 percent of the electricity supply of\nnorthern Viet Nam, while also contributing to low flow augmentation and flood peak reduction.\nIn the urban sector, major investments are needed in municipal water supply, drainage,\nwastewater disposal, and sanitation to keep pace with rapid urban and industrial expansion.\nProtection of groundwater quality from pollution and management of salinity intrusion are also\ncritical issues. Transport of freight by river will continue to be important, but is restricted durinq\nthe dry season, when low river flows are further reduced by abstractions for irrigation.\nSignificant pollution of the Basin's water resources has resulted from industrial development,\nand from rapid urban expansion. Pollution of village water sources is also widespread due to\nreturn flows from small-scale local industry, poor sanitation, and increased application of\npesticides.3\n7. As the competition among water users increases, the cross-sectoral impacts of\nmanagement decisions will become increasingly significant to the Basin's future prosperity.\nThe consequence of retaining the status quo is increasing conflict over resource allocation and\ndeteriorating water quality, which will disproportionately affect the lives of the rural poor and\nrequire significant financial resources to rectify. These trends have been recognized by the\nGovernment, and steps towards more integrated water resources management have been\ninitiated. Basin management and coordination across sectors and administrative units are key\naspects of the draft water law. Numerous institutional and administrative models for river basin\nmanagement exist, but adaptations will be required to suit Viet Nam's economic, political,\ninstitutional, socioeconomic, and physical environment. Consensus building among agencies\nwill be essential to achieve commitment to the new policies. The proposed TA is consistent\nwith the Bank's Medium-term Strategic Framework in its approach to institutional strengthening\nand in providing a foundation for subsequent capacity-building activities.\nLoan No. 1259-VIE:lrngation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation, for $76500 million, approved on 26\nOctober 1993; and Loan No. 1344-V1E:Red River Delta Water Resources Sector, for $60.00 million,\napproved on 13 December 1994.\nRecommendations for improvement in river transport routes in the Basin are being prepared under TA No.\n2615-VIE:Red River Waterways, for $980,000, approved on 24 July 1996.\nWater Environment Survey of Two Red River Delta Irrigation Schemes, January 1997 under TA No. 2233-\nVIE: Capacity Building in the Water Resources Sector.", "3\nIll.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The overall sector goal to which the proposed TA will contribute is improved\nmanagement of water resources in the Red River Basin, which reflects national development\ngoals, promotes sustairiability of the water environment, and is responsive to rapidly changing\ndemands. The proposed TA is the first step in improving the Government's capability for\nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) 1 in the Basin, and aims to develop a more\nappropriate policy and institutional framework, increase understanding of the issues facing the\nBasin, and provide a sound basis for future management interventions.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The scope of the proposed TA covers support in three areas: (i) development of\na policy and effective institutional framework for IWRM in the Basin; 2 (ii) development of a\nwater sector information system that focuses on the changing demands, hydrology, and land\nuse; and (iii) priority studies addressing key functions of JWRM and the resolution of a set of\ncritical water resources problems.\nPolicy and Institutional Framework\n10. As an interim arrangement to guide the process of establishing a river basin\norganization (RBO), the Government will establish a Red River Basin Strategy Committee,\nwhich will (i) prepare a policy statement on IWRM in the Basin and submit it for Government\nadoption, (ii) develop the institutional framework within which the RBO and the line agencies\nwill operate and submit it to Government for approval, (iii) identify the powers required by the\nRBO and necessary implementing arrangements, and (iv) guide the process of establishing\nthe RBO. Consultation with stakeholders at the provincial and district levels will be promoted\nthrough workshops and the establishment of a water sector network. 3 Senior policy makers will\nundertake study visits to two countries in the Region in relation to IWRM.\n2.\t Red River Basin Information System\n11. An Information System will be initiated as a key resource for water management\nby the RBO and the line agencies. Activities will comprise (i) preparation of a River Basin\nProfile detailing issues, problems, and opportunities in water and land resources management;\n(ii) compilation of a Water Resources Data Directory 4 (WRDD); (iii) assessment of the\nadequacy of existing data on surface water, groundwater, water quality, sedimentation, and\nland use; (iv) assessment of the capabilities of existing geographic information systems (GIS)\nand recommendations for integration of data; (v) development of a GIS to support the River\nBasin Profile, the WRDD, and training in its use; and (vi) recommendations for appropriate\nThe relevant sectors include irrigation; drainage; flood management; hydropower, urban, rural, and\nindustrial supply: sanitation, navigation; fisheries and other ecological requirements: and land\nmanagement.\n2 \nThe TA will focus on the area of the Basin within Viet Nam, namely the catch rnents of the Da, Red, Chay,\nLa and Thai Binh Rivers. It is proposed that appropriate contacts with the Government of the PRC will be\nmade during TA implementation to promote cooperation in Basin management.\nA computer system developed under UNDP Project VIE/93/031 will be operational in all provinces in the\nBasin by January 1998, and will be utilized for the water sector network.\nA computerized database containing information about existing datasets, reports and information.", "4\nsurface water and groundwater models, decision support systems, and other predictive and\nmanagement tools.\n3.\t Management Studies and Pilot Improvements\n12. At least three specific studies related to introducing IWRM in the Basin will be\ncarried out based on priorities identified in the River Basin Profile and deliberations of the\nCommittee. The studies selected will relate to at least one of the following (i) increasing\nunderstanding of the natural processes affecting water resources management, (ii)\ndevelopment of detailed procedures for implementing components of IWRM, and (iii) capacity\nbuilding. Sample studies include (i) the approach to licensing water extractions in the light of\ncurrent and projected water demands, (ii) a review of projected land use changes and their\nimpact on water resources management, and (iii) a strategy for community participation.\n13. Implementation of at least two pilot water management initiatives will be\nfacilitated through the auspices of Committee members. The aim is to resolve existing areas of\nconflict or competition that are not being addressed due to lack of coordination. Candidate\nissues will be agreed upon by the Committee. Two examples are (I) optimization of flood\ncontrol, irrigation, and hydropower operating rules for the main reservoirs, and (ii) reduction in\nriver pollution at Viet Tn. The benefits of IWRM in resolving such issues will be quantified.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan'\n14. The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $1,255,000 equivalent,\ncomprising $845,200 in foreign exchange cost and $409,800 equivalent in local currency cost.\nThe Bank will finance $1,150,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $304,800\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute the balance of the local\ncurrency cost of $105,000 equivalent through the provision of experienced counterpart staff,\nallowances, office accommodation, administrative services, data collation, and use of the\ncomputer network. The proposed TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Details of the cost estimates and\nfinancing plan are given in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n15. The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 27 months, commencing in\nJanuary 1998, and is divided into two phases. The initial phase of nine months will cover drafting\nand review of the policy statement on IWRM, preparing the River Basin Profile, and defining the\nscope of water resource management functions. The second phase will cover redefining functional\nresponsibilities, developing the information system, undertaking management studies and pilot\nimprovements, and establishing the RBO. A tirm of international consultants, in association with\ndomestic consultants, will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. It is envisaged that a total of 58 person-months of consulting services\nwill be required, comprising 28 person-months of international and 32 person-months of\ndomestic consultants. The international consultants will comprise specialists in water resources\nplanning, policy and institutional reform, GIS and data management, water licensing, and water\nquality. The domestic consultants will comprise a water resources advisor, water policy advisor\nand specialists in GIS, water quality, and land use.

It is expected that there will be a one-month interval between the two\nphases. The outhne terms of reference are given in Appendix 2.\n16. In view of its mandate for water resources management, the Executing Agency\nfor the proposed TA will be the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD).' The\nProject Director will be a Vice Minister of MARD, and the Project Manager will be the Director\nof the Department of Water Resources Management (DWRM). To assist the process of\ntransition to an RBO that is independent of line agency responsibilities, a Vice Minister of the\nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI) will chair the Strategy Committee and be\nresponsible for liaison with policy makers of other concerned agencies for this component.\nMembers of the Committee will comprise representatives at the Vice Minister level from each\nof the central ministries and agencies in the water sector. The Committee will meet at key\ndecision stages to (i) review drafts of the policy statement, (ii) review water resources\nmanagement functions, and (iii) reach agreement on the new institutional framework and\nresponsibilities. At least two tripartite reviews will be held to coincide with Committee meetings\nat stages (i) and (iii). DWRM will be the Secretariat to the Committee, and the Consultant's\npolicy specialist will liaise directly with the Chairman of the Committee and the Project Director.\n17. To support the Committee, a Working Group comprising participants from\napproximately 25 central and provincial agencies will be established. 2 The composition of the\nWorking Group will be ratified at the first meeting of the Committee. With inputs from the\nconsultants, the Working Group will prepare the draft policy statement on 1WRM and draft the\nRiver Basin Profile. It will also provide feedback on working papers prepared by the\nconsultants on the new institutional framework.\n18. The following reports will be produced under the proposed TA: (i) an inception\nreport including an outline for the policy statement two months after mobilization, (ii) the River\nBasin Profile after six months, (iii) the final draft policy statement after nine months, (iv)\nprogress reports after 12 and 19 months, (v) a draft final report after 24 months, and (vi) the\nfinal report three months later. Assurances provided by the Government are (i) to establish the\nCommittee at the Vice Minister level prior to contract negotiations with the consultants, (ii) to\nestablish the Working Group within two months of the consultants' mobilization, (iii) to make\navailable existing data and reports, and (iv) to ensure timely review of draft policies and\nrecommendations of the Committee.\nIV.

The recommendations will be reviewed and discussed with the\nCommittee and submitted to the Government for approval.\n(xii) Draft the decrees and detailed implementation arrangements for the new institutional\nframework.\nReference should be made to the initial findings of TA No. 2817-PRC:Strategic  Options in the Wafer\nSector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997.\nThe term institutional framework covers policy and legislation, organization structures and modes of\nworking and coordinating, dissemination of information, and consultation and decision making processes.", "10\t\nAppendix 2,page4\n(xiii) Prepare an institutional support program for capacity building under the new\narrangements1 and outline an action plan for implementation of IWRM.\nC.\t Red River Basin Water Sector Information System\nPhase 1\n(i) Prepare an outline, format, and guidelines for the preparation of a Red River Basin\nWater Sector Profile, adapted from the National Water Sector Profile.1\n(ii) Facilitate the functioning of the Working Group, through workshops, computer-based\ninformation exchange, and other appropriate means to prepare the Profile. The Profile\nshould identify the major water resource issues facing the Basin, including emerging\nissues, identify future trends, and include updated projections of supply and demand\nfor each sector based on a collation of secondary data. In particular, it should identify\nthe constraints that now or may in the future hinder the effective solution of such\nissues, and also the opportunities that may exist to facilitate or accelerate their solution.\nPhase II\n(iii) Based on current international practice, design and implement a Water Resources Data\nDirectory (WRDD), that is, a database containing information about the data sets,\nreports, and other information that already exist and are relevant to water resources\nmanagement in the Red River Basin (including which agency holds the information and\nwhere, the medium on which it is held, the time period over which it is valid, etc.). The\nWRDD should be implemented on a Geographic Information System (GIS) to allow\nsearching of the database by geographical area (spatially) as well as by textual\nmeans.2\n(iv) Facilitate the Working Group to collect information about data held in each of the\nagencies and prepared through the assistance programs of external agencies (not the\ndata themselves, but information about the data), and arrange to have this information\nincluded in the WRDD.\n(v) Assess the adequacy and appropriateness of existing data on surface water,\ngroundwater, water quality, sedimentation, land use, and other associated data in\nresponse to information needs to support decision making for effective water resources\nmanagement. This assessment will include consideration of the extent of the data\nacquisition networks; the frequency of measurement; the reliability of the data; the\nsystems used to store, manage, archive, and disseminate the data; and the availability\nof the data to all agencies that need it to plan and to make management decisions. In\nparticular, provide the specifications for a computerized data management system to be\nimplemented within MARD that will fulfill the needs of the Government to achieve its\nwater resources management objectives, and establish whether any existing system\nwithin the agencies meets those specifications. Include the results in the final report.\nSee Towards Effective Wafer Policy in the Asian and Pacific Region, Vol II, ADB 1996.\nReference should be made to Bank TA No. 5622-RETA:Subregional Environmental Monitoring Information\nSystems in which Viet Nam and PRC have agreed on database standards.", "11\t\nAppendix 2,page5\n(vi) Assess the GIS and remote sensing capabilities of each of the key agencies, and\nrecommend strategies for improved integration of the data they hold and for greater\naccessibility of the data to planners and decision makers. This will include the\nidentification of areas of duplication of effort in capturing data. Prepare\nrecommendations, for discussion by the Committee, on how existing data can be better\nshared. Commence the process by implementing a GIS system in the Department of\nWater Resources Management incorporating clear guidelines for the dissemination and\navailability of the data.\n(vii) Evaluate the need for surface water and groundwater models, decision support\nsystems, and other predictive and management tools that will facilitate more effective\nwater resource planning and decision making in the Basin. Identify and evaluate\nexisting tools that have been implemented by the agencies; comment on their\nusefulness; recommend improvements; and, where appropriate, recommend new\nsystems that should be acquired.\n(viii) Provide necessary training to relevant groups in the use of the WROD and GIS, and\nfacilitate dissemination of the information system through the Working Group.\nD.\t Management Studies and Pilot Water Resource Management Improvements\nPhase I\n(I) Based on the River Basin Profile, propose a set of specific studies aimed at addressing\nthe most critical water resources management issues in the Basin for consideration and\nselection by the Committee. The studies should reflect the importance of issues\nidentified in the Bank's Regional Consultation Workshop held in May 1996 and meet\none of the following criteria: (a) increasing understanding of the natural processes\naffecting water resources, (b) developing detailed procedures for implementing\ncomponents of IWRM, and (C) capacity building related to the new institutional\nstructure. The selection will be subject to the concurrence of the Bank prior to\ncommencement. Prepare the scope and terms of reference for the studies selected.\nThe following examples are indicative of the issues that may be considered:\nOn the issue of water entitlements and licensing, assess the desirability of licensing\nwater extractions in the light of current and projected water demand.1 Consider the\nprovisions of Viet Nam's proposed new Water Law and the implications that it might\nhave on the bestowing of water rights and the administration of those rights.\nEvaluate water licensing systems elsewhere in the world and recommend an\nappropriate system for the Red River Basin.\nConduct a review of projected land use changes and their impact on water\nresources management in the Red River Basin. The review should include a\ndemographic analysis, looking specifically at likely scenarios for urban growth and its\nimpact on rural development, agriculture, and irrigation. Identify likely trends in water\ndemand and the locations of those demands. Assess the impacts of these trends on\nwater resource management in the basin.\nDemand also includes instream environmental flows.", "12\nAppendix 2,page6\n\u2022 On the basis of experience from developed countries and other developing  countries\nthat have faced similar rapid growth, and taking note of existing social structures,\nprepare draft guidelines for community participation and stakeholder representation\nfor water resources management. The needs and representation of indigenous\ncommittees in the highland provinces and among rural and urban poor communities\nincluding specific attention to the participation of women, should be addressed in\nformulation of such a strategy.\n(ii) Also based on the River Basin Profile, and in conjunction with the Working Group,\npropose a set of pilot management interventions aimed at demonstrating the benefits of\na coordinated approach to water resources management in real situations occurring in\nthe basin for selection by the Committee. Two such initiatives that could be considered\nare (a) optimization of conjunctive operating rules covering flood control, hydropower,\nand irrigation for Hoa Binh, Thac Ba, Cam Son, and Nui Coc reservoirs; and (b) the\nriver pollution situation at Viet Tn. The Working Group should be used as the forum\nwithin which these case studies are facilitated.\nPhase II\n(iii) Undertake the Management studies and facilitate the pilot interventions identified\nduring Phase I as indicated in items (i) and (ii), respectively, with the involvement of\nrelevant interest groups and specialists.\n(iv) Based on the enhanced understanding of conditions in the Basin and results of the\nstudies and pilot interventions, and with reference to the experience of other basins,\nmake a projection of the costs and benefits from full implementation of IWRM in the\nRed River Basin. Part of the benefits may be valued in monetary terms, although longer\nterm impacts, which are less quantifiable, may be assessed by more qualitative means.\n(v) Ensure that the results of the case studies, pilot interventions, and evaluation are\nwidely disseminated to clearly demonstrate the benefits of the integrated water\nresources management to the stakeholders, including senior policy makers and\nlegislators. Proposals for the most effective form of information dissemination should be\ndeveloped during the initial stage of the studies."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080229122129+08'00'", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "red river basin water, viet nam water resources management, red river basin water management, viet nam red river basin water, adb loan 2871, tar: vie 25271", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3185-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20080401155458+08'00'", "Title": "Red River Basin Water Resources Management Project"}}
