THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Kingdom of Thailand for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) \nProgram under the Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic response option.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program supports the government\u2019s efforts to counter the impacts of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19). As of 18 June 2020, COVID-19 has infected 3,141 people and \nclaimed 58 lives in Thailand. As a result, the government imposed a partial lockdown and travel \nbans in April and significantly increased health spending. However, while the health impact has \nbeen contained, the efforts to flatten the pandemic curve have steepened the recession curve. \nWith a large tourism sector, strong global supply chain links, and a large base of migrant workers, \nThailand\u2019s economy is highly vulnerable to the pandemic. Real gross domestic product (GDP) is \nforecasted to contract 6.7% in 2020, down from the pre-pandemic projection of 3%.2 An estimated \n3.1 million workers are expected to lose their jobs, and 5.2 million people are expected to fall back \ninto poverty. Given the country\u2019s strong regional trade, investment, and labor links, an economic \ncrisis in Thailand could induce large negative spillovers to neighboring countries, particularly \nCambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV). \n \n3.  The government and Bank of Thailand (BOT) introduced a number of relief and stimulus \npackages, totaling $71.4 billion (B2.3 trillion) to support the healthcare sector, protect the poor \nand the vulnerable, stimulate the economy, and stabilize the financial markets in fiscal years (FY) \n2020 and 2021. Fiscal stimulus measures account for $38 billion (B1.2 trillion), and the rest are \nmonetary measures taken by BOT. The large relief program together with a steep revenue \ncompression will double the fiscal deficit to 5.3% of GDP and almost double the total financing \nneeds for FY 2020 to $39.9 billion. The government sought Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport to cover the exceptional fiscal requirements in FY 2020. Thailand meets all access criteria \nof the COVID-19 pandemic response option (Table 1).3  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  Concerns of recurrent outbreaks remain, in view of Thailand\u2019s strategic location \nexogenous  and connectivity in the region. The pandemic will result in GDP contraction of \nshocks  6.7% in 2020, the lowest level since the 2008 global financial crisis. COVID-19 \nis expected to lead to 3.1 million job losses and additional 5.2 million poor \npeople. The budget deficit is expected to widen to 5.3% of GDP and off-budget \nspending could add an equivalent of 3.8 percentage points to the fiscal-deficit-\nto-GDP ratio. Gross financing needs have increased by 91.8% to $39.9 billion, \nwith external financing rising by $4.8 billion from a very low base of $0.1 billion. \nLarge capital market volatilities and increased pressure in the finance sector \nhave raised concerns over the liquidity conditions and posed challenges to \nresource mobilization to meet the financing needs. Regional spillovers of the \nadverse impact in Thailand to the neighboring economies are significant. \n2. Countercyclical  The  government  introduced  $71.4  billion  (B2.3  trillion)  stimulus  and  relief \ndevelopment  packages, of which $38 billion (B1.2 trillion) is for pro-poor fiscal stimulus \nexpenditures  measures for FY 2020 and 2021 to (i) support the healthcare sector, (ii) provide \nsocial assistance to the poor and the vulnerable, and (iii) help businesses to \n \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2020.

Manila). \n3  Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4. \n ", "2 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \nrecover from COVID-19. $19.9 billion is allocated for FY 2020 fiscal measures, \nof which $13.7 billion will be for social assistance programs, and the remainder \nwill support the health sector, economic recovery, and tax relief measures. The \nremaining $18.1 billion will be allocated for FY 2021, mainly for economic and \nsocial recovery. In addition, BOT unveiled $33.4 billion monetary measures to \nsupport businesses and stabilize the financial markets. \n3. Pre-shock record  Average GDP growth during 2015\u20132019 was 3.4%. Inflation was stable and well \nof sound  below 2%. The fiscal deficit was kept at a healthy level, averaging 2.8% of GDP \nmacroeconomic  during 2015\u20132019. Public debt, including contingent liabilities of state-owned \nmanagement  enterprises and public-private partnerships stood at 41.2% of GDP in 2019, \nbelow the standard vulnerability benchmark. The external position was strong, \nwith a current account surplus averaging 7.9% of GDP during 2015\u20132019. In \n2019, international reserves reached $224.3 billion (equivalent to 9.8 months of \nimports). The Thai baht gained strength for most of 2019. Monetary policy was \naccommodative in line with modest inflation and the declining global interest \nrates. However, vulnerabilities arising from relatively high levels of household \nindebtedness  remain.  BOT  has  been  conducting  regular  stress  tests  and \nadopted regulatory forbearance to accommodate the deterioration in banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets. Financial vulnerabilities appear to be contained and the banking \nsystem can withstand a shock as severe as the Asian financial crisis. \n4. Structural  To  manage  the  health  crisis,  the  government  established  the  Centre  for  \nReforms   COVID-19 Situation Administration, formulated a pandemic preparedness plan, \ndeclared a state of emergency, and imposed partial lockdown, and enforced a \ncurfew. $1.8 billion was allocated to procure medical supplies and support \nmedical staff. The government\u2019s COVID-19 response packages also include \nprograms to support the poor and the vulnerable, small- and medium-sized \nenterprises, and post-COVID-19 economic recovery.  \n5. Debt  Public debt is sustainable. 97% of public debt is domestic with the average time \nSustainability  to maturity of over 10 years. The CARES program will contribute 0.3 percentage \npoints to the public debt-GDP ratio. If the government exhausts the borrowing \nheadroom in FY 2020 and 2021, the public debt-GDP ratio will increase to 52.2% \nin 2020 and 58.4% in 2021\u2014below the 60% legal debt ceiling. \n6. Coordination with  ADB is in close contact with the International Monetary Fund on the impact of \nthe International  COVID-19  and  Thailand\u2019s  fiscal,  monetary,  and  overall  responses.  The \nMonetary Fund  International Monetary Fund has provided an assessment letter. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, B = baht, BOT = Bank of Thailand, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints4 \n \n4.  Thailand\u2019s recurrent waves of COVID-19 outbreaks. Thailand was one of the first \ncountries outside the People\u2019s Republic of China to experience the COVID-19 outbreak. In the \nfirst two months of 2020, the number of cases was low, and no control measures were imposed. \nHowever, in mid-March, the number of cases quickly increased. The Ministry of Public Health \n(MOPH) projected that a quarter of the population could be infected by the end of 2020 (Figure) \nif public health measures were to prove ineffective. Even under the \u201cwell-contained\u201d scenario \nwhere intensive measures are taken, COVID-19 could still infect 400,000 people by the end of \n \n4  The pandemic has now spread to 188 countries and territories. The IMF has forecast a 3% contraction in global \nGDP, and ADB estimates global economic losses to reach $8.8 trillion. \n ", "3 \n2021.5 These findings prompted  the declaration of the state of emergency, enforcement of \ncurfews, and bans on travel and gatherings. As a result, the infection rate started to fall in April, \nuntil a new cluster of migrants were tested positive, prompting concerns over another outbreak \namong this high-risk group. By 18 June 2020, 3,141 confirmed cases were reported. \n \n \n  Figure: Three COVID-19 Pandemic Forecast Scenarios \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  Source: Ministry of Public Health. \n \n \n5.  Potential surges in COVID-19 cases could overwhelm the health system. Compared \nto many countries in Asia, Thailand\u2019s healthcare system is relatively developed, having achieved \nuniversal health coverage.6 However, some dimensions of pandemic preparedness, including \nmapping priority public health risks and utilizing resources, and effectively managing points of \nentry, remain weak.7 Thailand, therefore, remains highly vulnerable to the pandemic.8 As the \ngovernment begins to relax the lockdown, the healthcare system is on high alert. Without a \nvaccine, identifying active cases among vulnerable populations is critical. As of 18 June 2020, \nThailand had carried out 6,708 tests per one million people, fewer than Singapore (98,516) and \nMalaysia (20,536).9 Further, Thailand needs to urgently address its acute personnel constraints \nin the health sector. The density of medical workers is 3.10 per 1,000 people, below the World \nHealth Organization (WHO) recommended threshold of 4.45 per 1,000 people. Even without \nCOVID-19, the shortage of nurses is critical.10 There are also shortages in the supply of masks \nand personal protective equipment due to rising global demand and supply constraints. Finally, \nThailand must tackle its health inequalities to ensure that COVID-19 patients in remote areas \nreceive the same access to quality healthcare as those in bigger cities.11 \n \n \n5  MOPH. 2020.

With responses to \nflatten the pandemic curve, Thailand\u2019s economy is projected to experience a sharp contraction of \n6.7% in 2020 (footnote 2), with a GDP loss of $45.9 billion, making Thailand the worst-hit economy \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).12 Several industries have been impacted, \nmost notably tourism which directly and indirectly accounts for nearly 20% of GDP. Manufacturing \n(accounting for 34% of GDP in 2019) is expected to contract by 3.2% in 2020 because of declining \nexport demand and disruption in global supply chains. Automotive production dropped 24.6% in \nMarch after the suspension of operations in several manufacturing plants. The government \nestimates that 1.3 million small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (44% of total SMEs), \nwhich employ more than four million people could be affected by COVID-19.13  \n \n7.  Tourism sector will take the biggest hit. Besides being a dominant sector, tourism also \nhas several links to the rest of the economy, including hospitality, aviation, and the informal \nsector.14 Tourist arrivals collapsed in May due to travel bans, and will likely remain very low \nthroughout the summer. The tourism industry is expected to suffer a $50 billion revenue loss \n(9.5% of GDP) in 2020. The aviation industry has experienced a 52% drop in passenger demand \nin the first quarter and is expected to lose $8.3 billion in revenue in 2020.15 Many informal \nbusinesses whose livelihoods depend on tourist spending, which fell 40% in the first quarter, are \nat risk. Finally, empirical evidence suggests that informal tourism sector is more affected by global \ncrises and regional environmental disasters than the general informal economy.16 \n  \n8.  Potential increase in unemployment and reversal of gains in poverty reduction. With \nthe economic slowdown, ADB estimates that 3.1 million Thai workers could become unemployed. \nThe most vulnerable sectors are manufacturing, wholesale, and retail trade, accommodation, and \nrestaurants. The impact will be most severe on informal workers, accounting for 54% of the labor \nforce (20.4 million out of 38 million people, 45% of whom are women), who are not covered by \nany social protection scheme and cannot work from home. Informal workers, on average, earn \nless than half the monthly salary of formal workers and often report low income as their primary \nproblem. Female employment  is high  in several  affected  business  areas  (52% of informal \nwholesale and retail, and 65% of informal accommodation and food services). COVID-19 could \ndisplace an estimated 11.7% of female workers, compared with 7.6% of male workers.17 The \npandemic is expected to increase Thailand\u2019s poverty incidence from 8.8% in 2019 to 16% in 2020 \nunder the worst-case scenario. This translates into an additional 5.2 million poor people in 2020, \nusing the national poverty line of $5.50 per person per day at the 2011 purchasing power parity.18 \n \n9.  Thailand\u2019s aging population at high risk. Thailand has a large population of older \npeople (13 million people over age 60; 55% of whom are female), who are particularly vulnerable \nto COVID-19. Many suffer from poor health conditions and need support from caregivers; 10% \nlive alone, increasing the physical and mental health risks associated with isolation. The poverty \nheadcount for households headed by the over 65  is high (12.9% compared  with 7.7%  of \nhouseholds headed by the 45\u201364 age group). With pension and remittance support unevenly \nspread, and almost half of men and a quarter of women over 60 continuing to work, the pandemic \nwill likely disrupt the income streams of the elderly, increasing their financial hardship. \n \n12 Economic loss using ADB\u2019s 2020 GDP forecast for Thailand (-6.5%) is $44.2 billion. \n13 SMEs make up more than 90% of business entities and employ three-quarters of the total workforce. \n14 World Bank. 2020.

Thailand has an estimated 4.9 million \nmigrants, of whom only 2.9 million are documented. Majority of migrant workers in Thailand are \nfrom CLMV, with migrants from Myanmar accounting for the largest share. Every year, $2.8 billion \nin  remittances  are  sent  through  formal  channels  to  CLMV,  with  informal  remittance  flows \nestimated at twice as much.19 Migrant workers\u2019 contribution to Thailand\u2019s economy ranges from \n4.3% to 6.6% of GDP. However, they typically live in overcrowded environments with heightened \nrisks of infection and but often excluded from communicable disease control program. They also \nlack the economic means and social safety nets to access quality health services, food, and clean \nwater. This is exacerbated by potential job and income losses because of COVID-19. The partial \nlockdown made it challenging for support groups to reach the vulnerable migrants in remote \nareas. This leaves many women and girls at heightened risk of human trafficking. With school \nclosures, many children, especially girls, from poor migrant families are anticipated to drop out of \nschool to supplement their family\u2019s income. \n \n11.  Finance sector under rising stress. Thailand\u2019s banking system is highly exposed to \nmanufacturing,  SMEs,  and  households. 20  With  COVID-19,  the  debt-servicing  capacity  of \ncompanies and households is expected to deteriorate. To avoid a surge in non-performing loans, \ndebt restructuring efforts are ongoing, with $146 billion in debt (25% of total bank loans) being \nrestructured as of 8 May 2020.21 The insurance  industry is  expected to experience  lower \ninvestment incomes and higher insurance payouts related to hospitalization expenses, event \ncancellations, and business disruptions. As market liquidity conditions and investor confidence \ndeteriorate, the domestic capital markets have borne the brunt. A record outflow of $14.3 billion \nfrom fixed-income funds was experienced in the first quarter. Four bond mutual funds with  \n$9.4 billion assets under management were closed after panic selling by unitholders. These \nevents triggered sharp increases in government bond yields, with the 10-year local currency \ngovernment bond yield shooting up 100 basis points in March.22 In equities, foreign investors \nliquidated $3.7 billion worth of shares, the highest level among ASEAN stock exchanges. The \nStock Exchange of Thailand Index plunged 30% in the first quarter and market capitalization fell \nto its lowest level since 2013. In March, the exchange\u2019s circuit breaker was activated thrice. Thai \nbaht depreciated 10% in the first quarter, making it one of the worst-performing currencies.23 \n \n12.  Increasing pressure on the government\u2019s budget. The pandemic will seriously affect \nThailand\u2019s fiscal conditions, almost quadrupling the impact seen at times of natural disasters \nwhich are frequent in Thailand.24 Tax revenue is expected to decline by $10 billion (11.6%) from \nthe pre-COVID-19 projection of $86.7 billion. The biggest fall in tax revenue is expected in the \nsecond  quarter of 2020 due to the halt in  business activities, weak consumption, and tax \nincentives. Crisis response will require increased government spending mainly in the third quarter \nof 2020. The government has increased on-budget spending by $1.5 billion and plans to borrow \nup to $19.1 billion off-budget for COVID-19 spending in FY 2020. Thailand\u2019s fiscal deficit is \nexpected to widen from 2.7% to 5.3% of GDP in 2020. The expected off-budget COVID-19 \nspending could add an equivalent of 3.8 percentage points to the fiscal deficit-GDP ratio. These \nmeasures are supported by a Royal Emergency Borrowing Decree to accelerate fiscal stimulus \nmeasures and resource mobilization without supplementary budget processes.25  \n \n \n19 International Organization for Migration. 2019.

Thailand\u2019s  economic  crisis  adversely  affecting  CLMV.  With  its  economy  highly \ninterconnected with ASEAN, an economic crisis in Thailand could potentially have large negative \nspillovers (an estimated $785 million loss to ASEAN), affecting Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nthe hardest, in terms of percentage of GDP. First, as an international transit hub, Thailand plays \nan important role in regional tourism, which suffers heavily from the travel bans. Second, Thailand \nhas  strong  regional  value  chains  for  agricultural  products,  electronics,  and  automobiles. \nDisruptions to these will have a knock-on effect on the region\u2019s employment. As Thailand is one \nof the region\u2019s main food suppliers, trade disruptions will impact the supply, quality, and price of \nfood, which make up a large percentage of consumption of the poor. Third, with the Thai baht \ndepreciation and uncertain investment climate, Thailand\u2019s foreign direct investment to CLMV is \nexpected to fall or be diverted away from smaller economies. During the first quarter of 2020, \nThailand\u2019s committed greenfield investments into CLMV were 33% lower than in an average  \n3-month period in 2019 and 99% of Thai foreign direct investment went to Viet Nam. As of the \nend of March, Thai investors held a total $3.4 billion of foreign bonds from CLMV, of which, 98% \nare from  the  Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Thailand\u2019s deteriorating  domestic liquidity \nconditions could force investors to liquidate their foreign bond holdings, potentially creating a \nliquidity crunch in these countries.26 Finally, the economic crisis in Thailand could divert public \nspending away from critical regional infrastructure or climate-resilient projects. This will have a \nsignificant impact on the region\u2019s post-COVID-19 recovery and long-term sustainable economic \ndevelopment. \n \n14.  Government\u2019s  response  packages.  The  government  announced  several  stimulus \npackages, totaling $71.4 billion for FYs 2020 and 2021. Of the announced packages, $38 billion \nis for fiscal programs (Table 3) and $33.4 billion is for monetary measures. They are elaborated \nin paras. 15\u201319 below. The fiscal programs, implemented over both FYs, will: (i) provide social \nassistance to informal workers and farmers; (ii) support economic and social recovery; and  \n(iii) strengthen the health care system. Using Thailand\u2019s historical fiscal multipliers, ADB estimates \nthat the fiscal programs could increase economic output by $51.7 billion (10.1% of GDP) after  \none year, and $38.8 billion (7.6% of GDP) after two years.27 \n \nTable 3: Fiscal Programs for COVID-19  \nFY 2020  FY 2021 \nItem \n($ million)  ($ million) \nA: Health expenditures for COVID-19 prevention and control  1,787.3   \nPublic health reliefa  1,428.6   \nPublic health spending for COVID-19 preparedness and control     225.4   \nProcurement of masks, PPE, negative isolation rooms, testing kits     133.3   \n \n26 Regional Cooperation and Integration (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Fiscal Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nFY 2020  FY 2021 \nItem \n    ($ million)  ($ million) \nB: Social assistance programs  13,742.5   6,098.7 \nCash handout programs to 16 million informal workers    7,619.0   \nSocial assistance for 10 million families in agriculture sector     4,761.9   \nSocial assistance for 1.4 million children, 9.6 million older people    1,250.8   \nand 2 million persons with disability \nSocial assistance to 1.2 million low-income welfare cardholders      110.8   \nOther social assistance programs (details to be announced)      6,098.7 \nC: Economic and social recovery program      996.8  11,987.3 \nDomestic tourism stimulus packages (cash handouts and travel      711.1   \nsubsidies) \nEconomic and social recovery projects     11,987.3 \nSocial protection and subsidies to the provincial economies     285.7   \nD: Tax relief measuresb  3,403.2   \nTOTAL      19,929.8  18,086.0 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, PPE = personal protective equipment. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.  \na Including compensation to medical workers, procurement of medical equipment, disease control, research, and \nemergency measures. \nb Tax relief measures include: (i) income tax exemption for frontline medical workers, (ii) income tax deduction for super \nsaving  funding  investment,  (iii)  corporate  income  tax  deduction  for  businesses  that  retain  employment,  \n(iv) withholding tax reduction for businesses, (v) import duties and value-added tax exemptions for purchase of \nmedical equipment, and (vi) tax deduction for health insurance and debt structuring.  \nSource: Fiscal Policy Office and Comptroller General\u2019s Department, Ministry of Finance.   \n \n15.  Support for health sector. To respond to the pandemic, the government established the \nCentre for COVID-19 Situation Administration, chaired by the Prime Minister, to coordinate all \nCOVID-19 related health and economic actions.28 The government allocated $1.8 billion for health \nmeasures, including  healthcare workers\u2019 compensation, procurement of  medical equipment, \ndisease control and emergency measures, and activities to increase preparedness, mitigation, \nand risk communications. MOPH recruited more medical workers and volunteers to conduct \ncommunity outreach and detection activities, including in underserved rural areas. Since April, the \ngovernment has shifted to targeted surveillance, including active case-finding among vulnerable \ngroups. The  government  launched a contact tracing mobile application  and  scaled up the \nprocurement of masks, personal protective equipment, testing kits, and ventilators. The National \nHealth  Security  Office  included  COVID-19  in  its  healthcare  program  to  cover  prevention, \nawareness campaigns, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Finally, to reduce the risk of \ntransmission, 27 hospitals are piloting telemedicine services and primary healthcare facilities have \nincreased resources to absorb patients. \n \n16.  Support for individuals affected by COVID-19. The government rolled out several \nprograms to support affected individuals. $7.6 billion was allocated to the cash handout program \nwhich provides B5,000  per person per month for three months to 16 million people not covered \nby the social security system and $4.8 billion was allocated to support 10 million families in the \nagriculture  sector.29 Workers  under  the  social  security  system  will  receive  unemployment \ncompensation of up to 70% of their salary for up to 200 days. Other measures include: (i) B1,000 \nper month for three months to 1.2 million low-income welfare cardholders (total 14.6 million \n \n28 Summary of Strategies for COVID-19 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The government has created a cash handout registry. Thai nationals above 18, who are temporary workers not \ncovered under the Social Security System and affected by COVID-19, can apply by filling in their national ID details. \nQualified applicants will receive cash handouts via e-payment. Cash receipt is also available at district and municipal \noffices. As of 22 May, 14.2 million people have received the cash handouts. For those who failed to receive the cash \nhandouts, the government will request for missing information or allow them to appeal. \n ", "8 \npeople, 8.3 million of whom are female); (ii) B1,000 per month for three  months to 1.4 million \nchildren, 9.6 million older people, and two million disabled people; (iii) reduced compulsory social \nsecurity contribution; (iv) utility bills and land rental payment waivers; (v) deferred personal income \ntax; (vi) reduced health insurance premiums; and (vii) occupational training for informal workers. \nWomen who lost their jobs can enroll for free online skills training and their children are provided \nwith free milk. Migrants registered in the social security system are entitled to unemployment \nbenefits and all migrants, regardless of their legal status are eligible for free COVID-19 testing \nand treatment. Finally, a rice insurance scheme is available to support farmers.  \n \n17.  Fiscal and monetary support to businesses. The government introduced tax incentives \nto support affected businesses, especially SMEs. Corporate tax filing deadlines were extended. \nThe corporates\u2019 withholding tax rate was cut from 3.0% to 1.5% until the end of FY 2020. Imported \nmedical supplies are exempted from value-added tax for one year. Taxes and fees related to the \ndebt restructuring of non-financial institutions are exempted for two years. SMEs that retain their \nemployees can claim a tax deduction of three times the wage expenses during the second quarter \nof 2020. Monetary measures include soft loans totaling $6.2 billion from commercial banks, the \nSME Bank, and the Social Security Office. The BOT allocated $15.9 billion for soft loans and debt \nsuspension up to six months to support SMEs. Given the adverse impact on the tourism sector, \na significant share of the stimulus packages targets individuals as well as SMEs affected. The \nbox below highlights the government\u2019s plans. 30 \n \nBox: Special Measures to Revive Tourism \n The government, through TAT, has taken wide-ranging measures from the onset of the crisis, focused \non the short, medium, and long-term aspects: \n \n\u2022  Incorporating health and safety policies, including introducing the SHA certification system \n\u2022  Provision of soft loans to tourism-oriented SMEs, as part of the BOT $15.9 billion package \n\u2022  A significant part of the $7.6 billion social assistance program that provides cash transfers for \nthree months to the most affected individuals will likely reach the informal workers operating in \ntourism and related activities (1.8 million informal workers in hotels and restaurants, 3.2 million \nin wholesale and retail trade, and 522,000 in transport and storage sectors) \n\u2022  Tax incentives and soft loan program for SMEs, including in the tourism sector, through the \ngovernment\u2019s $4.8 billion package \n\u2022  A significant part of the $12.7 billion economic and social recovery projects will be allocated for \ntourism revival. \n\u2022  TAT and MOF currently aim to revive domestic tourism (domestic tourists took 166 million trips, \ngenerating $31.7 billion in revenue in 2019), through: (i) $76.2 million package to offer one-\nnight field trip organized by local tour agencies for 1.2 million health volunteers and local health \nofficials, (ii) $571.4 million worth of digital vouchers for Thai citizens to spend on travel-related \nactivities and accommodations, and (iii) $63.5 million package to offer two million domestic \nairline tickets to travelers. \n\u2022  TAT and the government plan to initiate bilateral and regional agreements for \u2018Travel Bubbles\u2019 \n(with focus on places such as Koh Samui, or Koh Pha Ngan) that allow for reciprocal open \nborders with other destinations that also have their coronavirus situation under control. \nBOT = Bank of Thailand; SHA = Security and Health Administration Certification;  SMEs = small-and-medium \nenterprises; TAT = Tourism Authority of Thailand. \na National Statistics Office. 2019.

BOT, the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), and the Securities  and Exchange Commission teamed up to stabilize the  financial \nmarkets. The BOT has cut the interest rate from 1.25% in January to a record low of 0.50% in \n \n30 Impact of COVID-19 on Thailand\u2019s tourism sector (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nMay. To stabilize the government bond market, BOT purchased a total $5.3 billion in government \nbonds. The BOT also cut financial institutions\u2019 contribution rate to the Financial Institutions \nDevelopment Fund to lower lending cost to the private sector. A special facility was established \nto provide liquidity for mutual funds through commercial banks that can use the underlying \ninvestment units of fixed income funds as collateral for liquidity support. The Securities and \nExchange Commission allowed asset management companies to use money market instruments \nto manage short-term liquidity. Finally, the emergency decree authorized BOT to purchase units \nin the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund of up to $12.7 billion.31 \n \n19.  Programs for post-crisis recovery. The government allocated $12.9 billion for economic \nand social recovery programs and projects, of which $12.0 billion will be for FY 2021.32 Projects \nin FY 2021 will be financed by government internal funds and/or by other development partners. \nThe government identified 6 priority areas to support: (i) smart farming; (ii) industry, trade, and \ninvestment; (iii) responsible tourism and services; (iv) economic recovery at community level;  \n(v)  projects  to  boost  domestic  consumption;  and  (vi)  infrastructure  development.  To  date,  \n31,801 projects, amounting to $23.4 billion, were submitted to the Loan Fund Disbursement \nConsideration Committee for consideration. The Committee will evaluate potential projects before \nsubmitting to the Cabinet in July 2020 for approval. \n \n20.   Lessons learned from similar programs. ADB considered four lessons from past \noperations. First, countercyclical support requires rapid response to  mitigate the  impact of \nexogenous shocks on the economy. In the case of COVID-19, delayed government support could \nlead to business insolvency, structural unemployment, and poverty, which will take a long time to \nreverse. Second, given that the poor are most impacted during crises, the program design should \nincorporate strong pro-poor measures with clear spending targets to alleviate the financial burden \non the most vulnerable. Third, through ADB\u2019s past crisis supports, ADB noted the importance of \nsequenced actions and identification of experts that could supplement Thailand\u2019s own resources \nto implement and sustain reforms.33 Finally, given Thailand\u2019s role in regional trade, food supply, \nand labor mobility, timely support to Thailand will help prevent wide-spread regional spillover that \ncould undermine the region\u2019s social and economic development. Having included these lessons \nincluded in the design of the program, ADB can be more effective in sowing the seeds for a swifter \neconomic recovery in Thailand and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). \n \nB.  Proposed Program, Impacts, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n21.  The  CARES  program.  As  highlighted  in  paras.  4\u201313,  Thailand  has  been  severely \nimpacted by the pandemic. The government has formulated a comprehensive response as \noutlined  in  paras.  15\u201319.  The  CARES  program  offers  clear  benefits  because  timely \ncountercyclical support will limit the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the poor and the vulnerable \nand ensure a speedier economic recovery in Thailand and CLMV (para. 24). Although Thailand \nhas a relatively developed domestic capital market, the large gross financing needs resulting from \nCOVID-19 have raised serious liquidity concerns, especially in the context of heightened market \nvolatility and fragile investor sentiment. The program will diversify the government\u2019s financing \nsources and avoid crowding out the private sector by the government. Finally, the program will \nstrengthen  engagement  between  Thailand  and  ADB  in  the  post-COVID-19  period  through \nprioritized areas such as sustainable development and regional cooperation and integration. \n \n31 Bond Stability Fund was set up to stabilize the corporate bond market (estimated at about 20% of GDP) by providing \nbridge financing to firms with bonds maturing during 2020\u20132021 and a minimum credit rating of BBB-. \n32 These projects will be financed from government funds and/or by other development partners. \n33 ADB. 2019. Thailand: Validation of the Country Partnership Strategy Final Review, 2013-2016. Manila. \n ", "10 \n \n22.  The program\u2019s impact will be: adverse effects of COVID-19 on economic growth and \npoverty mitigated. The outcome will be the healthcare system\u2019s preparedness for future pandemic \nsurge improved and adverse social and economic impact of COVID-19 mitigated. The program \nwill focus its support to the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus program for FY 2020 by assisting the \nhealth sector, the poor and the vulnerable, and the affected SMEs. It will have three outputs:  \n(i) measures to prepare the healthcare system for pandemic surges implemented; (ii) support to \nthe poor and the vulnerable impacted by COVID-19 expanded; and (iii) measures to support \nbusinesses, including SMEs impacted by COVID-19 implemented. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s value addition. The COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time when ADB is the only \nmultilateral development bank with ongoing sovereign and nonsovereign operations in Thailand. \nThis puts ADB in a unique position to provide timely countercyclical support to lessen the \neconomic impact of COVID-19 on the poor and the vulnerable. The CARES Program will help \nshape the government\u2019s response to better target the underserved, including women, and will \nsend a strong signal to raise investor confidence. In addition, through the program, ADB has \nhelped to catalyze other support, including by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank through \na cofinancing arrangement. To supplement the CARES Program, ADB approved a technical \nassistance project to help assess the adequacy and effectiveness of fiscal policies and to inform \na medium-term post-COVID-19 recovery plan in Thailand and other countries.34 \n \n24.  Clear benefits for Thailand and the entire region. Thailand\u2019s strong regional links mean \nthat the proposed program will bring strong regional value. First, through ADB\u2019s support to \nThailand,  CLMV\u2019s  economic  development  will  be  further  advanced  through  regional  trade, \ntourism, investment, and labor mobility. As an upper-middle-income country, Thailand\u2019s role in \nregional  economic development can be innovative in terms of cross-sectoral initiatives and \ncollaboration with the private sector. Furthermore, Thailand, as a leading actor in GMS, ASEAN, \nand the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, will play \na pivotal role in promoting inter-subregional value chains.35 Second, Thailand\u2019s economic and \nsocial stability is a regional public good, especially in healthcare, cross-border infrastructure, and \ngreen investments. Finally, Thailand\u2019s experience in crisis management and post-crisis reforms \nwill provide knowledge to the region in the post-COVID-19 era.  \n \n25.  Future engagement. ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy (CPS) consultation \nprocess has been extended to  adjust to the  government\u2019s emerging priorities.36 To make  \npost-COVID-19  recovery  sustainable  and  mitigate  regional  spillovers,  ADB\u2019s  sovereign \nassistance will focus on: (i) building back better through a pipeline of green and climate-resilient \ninfrastructure projects; and (ii) rebuilding regional cooperation through GMS working groups on \ntourism, trade, transport, and health. As the CARES Program will help restore growth, it sets the \nstage  for  targeted  ADB  non-sovereign  operations  that  can  reinforce  key  elements  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s post-COVID-19 recovery priorities. Besides the current strong engagement by \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department in infrastructure sectors, near-term non-sovereign \nassistance will focus on: (i) trade and supply chain finance to companies along the medical and \nagriculture supply chains; (ii) financial assistance to Thai companies expanding to the GMS;  \n(iii) SME financing; and (iv) investments in digital technology solutions, including those that \nstrengthen the economy\u2019s resilience to future pandemics and natural hazards. Finally, as an \n \n34 ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance for Policy Advice for COVID-19 Economic Recovery in Southeast Asia.

Alignment with Strategy 2030. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 on:  \n(i)  addressing  poverty  and  reducing  inequality  (through  support  to  the  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical  expenditure  program  to  boost growth  and reduce poverty); (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality (through support to female healthcare workers and female migrants); \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity (through support to strengthen health \nresponses to COVID-19); and (iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration (through support \nto migrant workers and regional value chains).  \n \nC.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support and Debt Sustainability \n \n27.  Given the impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s FY 2020 financing requirement is \nexpected to increase to $39.9 billion. Domestic financing is expected to increase by $14.3 billion, \nof which $5.4 billion was raised, to $35 billion.37 To avoid crowding out the domestic market under \nthe current tight liquidity conditions, in FY 2020, the government plans to increase foreign \nborrowing by $4.8 billion, of which $2 billion will be from development partners, and $2.8 billion \nwill be bond issues in the international capital market.38 \n \nTable 4: Financing Needs and Sources of Funds for FY 2020 \nItem  2020   2020 (adjusted  % change \n(pre-COVID-19)  for COVID-19) \n($ billion)  ($ billion) \nGross financing requirement  20.8   39.9  91.8% \nGross domestic financing  20.7   35.0  69.1% \nGross foreign financing    0.1     4.9   \n             Foreign currency bond issuance                  2.8   \n             ADB CARES Program       1.5   \n             AIIB       0.5   \n             Other development partners     0.1     0.1   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n \n28.  The government requested two loans of $500 million and $1 billion, both from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, to help finance the anticipated deficit arising from the pandemic \nresponse and countercyclical support expenditure needs, and the decline in expected revenue \ncollection. The loan of $500 million will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 6.75 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The second \nloan of $1 billion will have a five-year term, including a grace period of three years; an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \n \n37 Of the pre-COVID-19 domestic borrowing, the government issued B443 billion worth of bills and bonds, with bond \ntenors of 3\u201350 years and coupons of 1.45%\u20133.6%. The additional COVID-19 borrowing includes B120 billion in \npromissory notes (with tenors of 1\u20134 years) and B50 billion in 5- and 10-year saving bonds.  \n38 Thailand has not issued foreign currency government bonds in the international capital market since May 2008 when \nit issued total Y55 billion government bonds with tenors from 3 to 7 years and coupons ranging from 1.07% to 1.45% \nto refinance existing yen-denominated debts. \n ", "12 \nagreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 4.25 years, and there is \nno maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan size is based on Thailand\u2019s financing needs, and \ndevelopment spending arising from the development expenditure programs. Loan disbursements \nare expected in four tranches in July and August 2020. \n \n29.  Debt sustainability. Prior to the pandemic, the public debt-GDP ratio was expected to \nincrease from 41.2% in 2019 to 42.2% in 2020, gradually reaching 45.6% in 2023 before tapering \nto 45.1% in 2024. With COVID-19, under the worst-case scenario where the government exhausts \nthe emergency decree\u2019s borrowing headroom of $31.7 billion (B1 trillion) (footnote 25), public \ndebt-GDP ratio is forecast at 48.7% in 2020, gradually increasing to 51.2% in 2024. The CARES \nProgram will add only 0.3 percentage points to the public debt-GDP ratio. The COVID-19-adjusted \npublic debt-GDP ratio is still below the government\u2019s 60% debt ceiling. The overall public debt \noutlook remains stable since more than 97% of the public debt is in local currency and 92% is \nlong-term debt (with an average time to maturity of 10.3 years). If the government\u2019s domestic debt \nstructure stays the same, an increase in domestic financing of 68.7% will raise the debt-service \nratio to around 14.5% of GDP, still below the 15% limit set by the government.39 \n \nD.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n30.  ADB has discussed the proposed program with the IMF which confirmed Thailand\u2019s sound \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  management,  and  endorsed  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  stimulus \nprogram. 40  ADB  has  coordinated  with  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank which are discussing with the government \npotential budget support for FY 2021. At the government\u2019s request, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank indicated its intention to cofinance the CARES program, with a $500 million loan, \nand will disburse its cofinancing directly to the government. Development partners, including ADB \nand WHO, are discussing a formal health sector donor coordination platform. Japan\u2019s Ministry of \nHealth, Labour and Welfare and the United States Agency of International Development provided \nMOPH with medical equipment. The International Organization of Migration is supporting the \nMOPH in managing its COVID-19 call line for migrants and Thai nationals. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  MOF will be the executing agency. The government and ADB agreed on a country \nengagement framework to ensure the effective implementation and monitoring of COVID-19 \nresponse measures.41 Under the Royal Emergency Borrowing Decree, the government set up a \nLoan Fund Disbursement Consideration Committee, chaired by the secretary-general of the \nNational Economic and Social Development Council. The committee will engage with ADB \nthrough the Public Debt Management Office to monitor the CARES program. ADB and the \ncommittee  will  hold quarterly meetings to discuss  priority reform  issues, including  periodic \nreporting of sex-disaggregated data of program beneficiaries. Special working groups chaired by \nthe relevant government agencies involved in specific priority issues (e.g. job creation, social \nprotection, support for SMEs) will be formed. ADB, through a regional technical assistance \nproject, will convene these meetings and invite the respective government agencies to act as  \nco-chair (footnote 34). Engagement with the private sector and civil society organizations is \nenvisaged to seek feedback on the government\u2019s policy responses and share regional knowledge \non post-COVID-19 recovery. The program implementation period is July 2020 to June 2021.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  Governance.42 The  World  Governance  Indicators  2018  ranked  Thailand  above  the \nASEAN average in regulatory quality, government effectiveness, rule of law, and voice and \naccountability.43 Thailand ranked 47th of 117 countries in the Index of Public Integrity, performing \nabove  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  average  in  budget \ntransparency.44 Budget and fiscal risk oversights are comprehensive with sufficient information \non macroeconomic outlook, fiscal accounts, and government financial assets in the budget \ndocumentation. Public debt reporting includes contingent liabilities associated with guaranteed \nborrowing by state-owned enterprises. The Treasury Single Account, medium-term expenditure \nframework and fiscal management information system are in place. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n33.  Poverty and social. Thailand made considerable progress in reducing poverty. The \nnational poverty rate fell from 34.0% in 1988 to 8.8% in 2019. But pockets of poverty remain and \nare concentrated in the north and deep south provinces. The poorest groups work in agriculture \nand informal sectors, comprising part-time employees, self-employed households, and informal \nSMEs. The COVID-19 pandemic will exacerbate Thailand\u2019s poverty incidence (para. 8). It could \ntake at least two years to recover to the pre-crisis level. The program will support the government\u2019s \nsocial assistance measures to shield the poor and the vulnerable from economic shocks.   \n \n34.   Gender. The program is categorized as Effective Gender Mainstreaming. It aims to \nstrengthen the government\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic by addressing gender and \nsocial inclusion needs. Due to the pandemic, women with disabilities, female migrants, rural and \nolder women are increasingly vulnerable to gender-based violence, lost income, infection, and \nsocial exclusion because of mobility restrictions and heightened family care responsibilities. The \nCARES Program recognizes that female health care workers (48% of doctors and 95% of nurses \nare women) face a disproportionate risk of transmission and infection and responds by ensuring \nimproved testing of healthcare workers through specific protocols, and equal incentive pay for \nmale and female healthcare workers. Further, the program responds to the different needs of \nwomen  and  men  by:  (i)  ensuring  equal  access  to  coverage  for  COVID-19-related  health \nexpenses; (ii) extending the cash handout program to 16 million informal workers, 45% of whom \nare women; (iii) providing unemployment benefits to migrant workers, at least 30% of whom are \nwomen; and (iv) supporting highly affected sectors, especially those with a high representation of \nwomen workers such as manufacturing (48%), accommodation and food services (63%), health \nand social work (76%), education (65%), and home-based domestic work (86%).  \n \n35.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s \nsafeguards. The program is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguards impacts \nwithin the meaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement.45 \n \n \n42 A governance risk assessment is being prepared as part of the CPS for 2021\u20132025. \n43 World Bank.

Adverse impact of  On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. As of 18 June \nexogenous shocks   2020, 8.2 million have been infected and over 448,000 deaths have been recorded in 188 countries.a In Thailand,  \n3,135 positive cases and 58 deaths have been reported as of 17 June 2020.b The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on \nThailand\u2019s economy is expected to be significant due to its high dependence on tourism, merchandise exports, and global \nsupply chains. \n \nImpact on economic growth. Thailand\u2019s economic growth slowed to 2.4% in 2019 after a strong performance at 4.2% \nin 2018. The lingering trade conflict and the slowdown in the world economy weighed on the demand for Thai exports, \ncausing investment and employment in export-oriented businesses to decline. Economic growth is expected to be \nsluggish in 2020 mainly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF forecasted a GDP contraction of 6.7% in 2020, \ndown from the earlier forecast of 3.0% GDP growth. This is broadly in line with ADB\u2019s 2020 GDP forecast for Thailand of \n(-6.5%) and the official forecast by the BOT which projected a contraction of 5.3% in 2020. Based on the IMF\u2019s growth \nprojection, ADB staff estimates that the economic losses may be as high as $45.9 billion (and $44.2 billion, using ADB\u2019s \ngrowth forecast of -6.5%) \n \nImpact on key economic sectors. Thailand\u2019s economy depends on tourism and manufacturing, both of which have \nbeen hit hard by COVID-19. Thailand\u2019s tourism sector, which contributed 12% of GDP in 2019, has seen a 99% fall  \nyear-on-year in the number of tourist arrivals in the first few weeks of May 2020. Thailand\u2019s tourism sector could suffer \nfrom a $50 billion decline in revenue in 2020. With air travel restrictions, Thailand\u2019s aviation industry has experienced a \n52% drop in passenger demand in the first quarter of 2020 and is expected to lose $8.3 billion in revenue in 2020.  In \naddition, the manufacturing sector, which accounted for 34% of GDP in 2019, has been severely affected by the fall in \nexport demands and the disruptions in the global supply chains. The automotive industry, which is the largest in Southeast \nAsia, has seen a 24.6% drop in production in March following the suspension of manufacturing at several plants. The \nindustrial production index dropped by 11.25% year-on-year in March 2020. ADB staff projected that the manufacturing \nsector would contract up to 3.2% in 2020. Wholesale and retail sectors, which accounted for 58% of GDP in 2019, have \nalso experienced a drastic slowdown as non-essential businesses were closed during the state of emergency.c  Private \nconsumption fell by 4.8% year-on-year in March 2020, with net tourist spending falling by 26.7% month-on-month in \nMarch. The government estimated that 1.3 million SMEs (44% of total SMEs), which employ over four million people or \n25% of the total labor force, would be affected by COVID-19.   \n \nImpact on employment and poverty. With the economic slowdown, ADB staff estimated that 3.1 million Thai workers \ncould be unemployed (unemployment rate of 8%). The most vulnerable sectors include manufacturing, wholesale and \nretail trade, accommodation, and restaurants. An extended lockdown period may have a structural impact on the labor \nmarket, including a potential rise in structural unemployment and underemployment. This is especially relevant to Thailand \nas the economy is highly dependent on tourism and informal sectors which cannot support work from home. Female \n ", "Appendix 4  23 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nemployment participation is high in several affected sectors: 52% of informal wholesale and retail and 65% of informal \naccommodation and food services.  Women are also at a higher risk of being crowded out in employment during crises.  \nIt is estimated that COVID-19 could displace 11.7% of female workers, compared to 7.6% of male workers. COVID-19 is \nexpected to have a significant effect on poverty due to the complete halt in production, trade, and tourism. Due to the \npandemic, poverty incidence is forecasted to increase from 8.8% in 2019 to 16% in 2020 before coming down to 14.6% \nin 2021. This translates to additional 5.2 million poor people in 2020, using the national poverty line of $5.50 per person \nper day at the 2011 purchasing power parity.      \n \nWidening fiscal deficit. The government ran a fiscal deficit equal to 2.6% of GDP in the fiscal year 2019. Government \nrevenue collection in the fiscal year 2019 was 0.5% above the official target, while expenditure was 1.4% higher than the \nofficial target. The pandemic has a significant impact on Thailand\u2019s fiscal conditions. Tax revenue is expected to decline \nby $9.6 billion (11.6%) from the pre-COVID-19 projection of $82.8 billion. The biggest fall in tax revenue is expected in \nthe second quarter of 2020 due to the halt in business activities, weak consumption, and tax incentives. Crisis response \nwill require an increase in government spending mainly in the third quarter of 2020. The government has increased \nspending by $1.4 billion and plans to borrow up to $19.1 billion off-budget for COVID-19-related spending in the fiscal \nyear 2020. Thailand\u2019s fiscal deficit is expected to widen from 2.7% to 5.3% of GDP in 2020. Including the estimated  \noff-budget COVID-19 spending, the deficit could reach 9.1% of GDP in 2020. \n \nFinancial sector vulnerabilities. Thailand\u2019s banking sector is among the most exposed to manufacturing and SMEs in \nthe region. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the IMF assessed the build-up of financial vulnerabilities as a medium risk. \nWith the partial lockdown, corporates\u2019 ability to service bank loans is expected to deteriorate due to the lack of revenue. \nHousehold indebtedness is also among the highest in the region.  With COVID-19, debt servicing capacity of households \nis expected to worsen as most of their debts are for non-income generating purposes (mortgages or consumption). Non-\nperforming loans increased from 2.98% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 3.0% in the first quarter of 2020 and as of 8 May, \n$146 billion worth of debts (25% of the total banking sector loans) from 13 million SMEs and households have been \nrestructured. The insurance sector is expected to experience lower investment incomes and higher insurance payouts \nrelated to hospitalization expenses, event cancellations, and business disruptions. As market liquidity conditions and \ninvestor confidence deteriorate, the domestic capital markets have borne the brunt. A record outflow of $14.3 billion from \nfixed-income funds was observed in the first quarter of 2020.  Four bond mutual funds with total assets under management \nof $9.4 billion have been closed following panic selling by unitholders. These events triggered a sharp increase of \ngovernment bond yields, with the 10-year local currency government bond yield shooting up 100 basis points. In the \nequity market, foreign investors have been liquidating shares with the accumulated net sales of $3.7 billion, the highest \nlevel among ASEAN stock exchanges. The SET Index has plunged almost 30% since January 2020 and market \ncapitalization fell to its lowest level since 2013. In March 2020, the SET circuit breaker was activated thrice. Thai Baht \nhas lost almost 10% in value since the beginning of 2020. \n \nSocial impact. The older population and migrant workers are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Thailand has a \nlarge population of old people, with 5.7 million people over 70 and 13 million people over 60 (women make up 55% of \n ", "24  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \npersons over 60 and 61% of those over 80). As of 26 April 2020, the death rate among patients over 60 years old is 6.4%, \nversus 0.6% for people in the 30s and 1.9% for people in the 40s.  Economically, older people rely on a combination of \npensions, family remittances, and their own labor, with almost half of men and a quarter of women over 60 continuing to \nwork. The pandemic will likely disrupt the income source of old people and increase financial hardship, due to disruptions \nin their ability to work and their access to remittances from friends and family. Their ability to restart their livelihoods may \nbe affected by more stringent physical distancing guidelines, and lack of access to credit.  Likewise, Thailand has a large \npopulation of migrant workers. In 2019, Thailand hosted 4.9 million migrants, 3.9 million of whom came from Cambodia, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV). Migrant workers typically live in overcrowded and \nunhygienic environment, which heightens the risks of infection and disease transmission. According to an assessment by \nthe International Organization for Migration, the primary challenge for migrants since the COVID-19 outbreak is insufficient \nincome to afford food and clean water, as well as access to basic services like health care. The partial lockdown has \nmade it challenging for support groups to reach the most vulnerable people, especially migrants living in remote areas. \nThis leaves many girls and women at heightened risk of human trafficking. With school closure across the country, it is \nanticipated that many children, especially girls, from poor and migrant families will drop out of school to supplement their \nfamily\u2019s income. \n \nHealth impact. Thailand\u2019s health care system is relatively strong, having achieved universal health coverage.  However, \nas an open and interconnected economy, Thailand is highly vulnerable to the pandemic and recurrent waves of outbreaks. \nBefore vaccines and effective treatments become available, more investment in testing and active case tracing is needed \nto prevent potential surges, especially as many COVID-19 carriers are asymptomatic. As of 18 June 2020, Thailand has \ncarried out 6,708 tests per one million people, fewer than Singapore (98, 516) and Malaysia (20,536). This equates to \nroughly 3,442 tests per day since the first confirmed case (reported on 13 January 2020). Further, Thailand needs to \nurgently address its acute healthcare human resource constraints that may affect its ability to provide the necessary \nspecialized care. The density of medical workers in Thailand is 3.1 per 1,000 people, below the WHO recommended \nthreshold of 4.45 per 1,000 people.d In Thailand, approximately 78% of healthcare workers are female, including 48% \nfemale doctors, and 95% female nurses. A statistical model shows that even without COVID-19, there is a critical shortage \nof nurses in Thailand. In the face of rising global demand, Thailand also needs to urgently address shortages in medical \nsupplies. While 37.5 million surgical masks have been delivered, the MOPH aims to procure a total of five million N95 \nmasks (of which 119,100 have been procured and delivered) and five million pieces of PPE (8,640 PPE sets have been \ndelivered and delivery of another 10,650 is planned). The currently available 6,000 intensive care unit beds would not be \nadequate if the number of severe cases suddenly rises.  Finally, poor people, especially those in remote areas, do not \nhave the same access to quality health services as those living in big cities.  \n \n2. Countercyclical  The government has introduced a well-coordinated pro-poor countercyclical support measures to be supported by the \ndevelopment  CARES Program under the CPRO. The government launched relief and stimulus packages on 10 March, 24 March, and \nexpenditures  7 April 2020 amounting to $71.4 billion (B2.25 trillion). The measures pertain to a combination of fiscal spending, tax relief, \nand monetary interventions; and encompass health, social, and economic dimensions, aiming to mitigate the impact of \nCOVID-19 and ensure that the short- to medium-term shocks from COVID-19 will not leave long-term consequences on \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \npublic health, social development, and economic growth. These measures will benefit in total six million informal workers, \nwho account for 22% of the Thai population,10 million households in the agriculture sector, and 3 million SMEs. \n \nThese measures include: (i) increased health-related expenditures on COVID-19 prevention and control; (ii) cash handout \nprograms for 16 million temporary workers, contractors, and freelancers not in the social security system, and for     \n10 million households in the agriculture sectors; (iii) tax reliefs and tax payment deferral to increase liquidity among \nbusinesses and individuals; (iv) soft loans and a debt moratorium for SMEs and individuals through commercial banks, \nspecialized financial institutions, and government-owned pawnshops; (v) a corporate bond liquidity stabilization fund; and \n(vi) economic and social recovery plan.  \n \nIncreased  health-related  expenditures  on  COVID-19  prevention  and  control.  The  government  has  allocated  \n$1.8 billion for health relief measures, of which B45 billion is from the stimulus package and $358.7 million is from the \n2020 central budget reallocation. MOPH\u2019s 2020 budget has also been reallocated to recruit more medical workers and \nvolunteers. The $1.4 billion health relief package includes: (i) compensation for healthcare workers (including females \nwho make up 78% of the healthcare workforce); (ii) procurement of medicine and medical equipment; (iii) expenses \nrelated to testing, disease control, and research development; and (iv) expenses related to laboratories and hospitals for \nCOVID-19 detection and  emergency measures.  The  $358.7 million  budget  reallocation will be  used  to  improve \npreparedness, mitigation, and control for \u2018stage 2\u2019 of the outbreak, when infections are controlled at community level and \ntraceable, including health literacy and risk communication measures, outreach, and testing by village health workers (as \nopposed to stage 1 where outbreaks are just beginning). The government has created a mobile application for mental \nhealth checkups and offered free access to selected television programs and online concerts for mental wellbeing. \nProcurement of more surgical masks, testing kits (testing will also target vulnerable populations including women and \nmigrant workers), ventilators, negative pressure isolation rooms, and PPE is underway. In addition, the government has \ndetermined that the costs of testing and treatment of COVID-19 will be fully covered under its health insurance schemes.  \n \nSocial assistance programs for vulnerable groups affected by COVID-19. The government has rolled out the cash \nhandout program which provides B5,000 per month per person for three months for 16 million informal workers or workers \nwho are not covered by the social security system. The government initially set aside $2.2 billion from a reallocation of \nthe 2020 national budget for the cash handouts to support three million informal workers. The government later expanded \nthe cash handout programs to cover 16 million informal workers and 10 million households in the agriculture sector \naffected by the pandemic. It is estimated that women account for 45% of informal workers who can apply for the cash \nhandouts program. Sex-disaggregated data will be collected and analyzed to better monitor the program and makes sure \nwomen receive equal access. In addition, a $4.8 billion cash handout program was approved to support 10 million families \nin agriculture sectors (B5,000 per family per month for three months). Workers under the social security system will receive \nunemployment compensation of up to 70% of their salary for up to 200 days. Other social assistance measures include: \n(i) B1,000 per month for 3 months to 1.2 million low-income welfare cardholders (total 14.6 million people, 8.3 million of \nwhom are female), (ii) B1,000 per month for three months to 1.4 million children, 9.6 million older people, and 2 million \ndisabled people; (iii) reduced compulsory social security contribution; (iv) utility bills and land rental payment waivers;  \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n(v) deferred personal income tax; (vi) reduced health insurance premiums; and (vii) occupational training for informal \nworkers. Women who lost their jobs can enroll for free online skills training and their children are provided with free milk. \nMigrants registered in the social security system are entitled to unemployment benefits and all migrants, regardless of \ntheir legal status, are eligible for free COVID-19 testing and treatment. Finally, a rice insurance scheme is available to \nsupport farmers.  \n \nTax reliefs and tax payment deferral to increase liquidity among businesses and individuals. The MOF, through \nthe Revenue Department, has rolled out several tax measures aimed at increasing liquidity among businesses and \nindividuals during the state of emergency. ADB estimates that these tax measures will entail revenue losses amounting \nto $3.4 billion. For individuals, these measures include: (i) extension of personal income tax filing deadline to August \n2020; (ii) deduction of health insurance premiums increased to B25,000 from B15,000; and (iii) a tax exemption on risk \npayments for medical workers. For businesses, the measures include: (i) extension of corporate income tax fillings until \nSeptember 2020 and extension of other taxes for affected corporates by 3 months; (ii) reducing the withholding tax  from \n3% to 1.5% from April to September 2020 and the tax deduction incurred by salary payments up to three times for SMEs; \n(iii) extension of excise tax filing for service business (by one month) and oil product businesses (to 15th of the following \nmonth for three months consecutively); (iv) exemption of import duties for products related to the prevention and treatment \nof COVID-19; and (v) exemption of taxes and a reduction of fees for debt restructuring with non-financial institutions. \n \nSoft loans and a debt moratorium for SMEs and individuals by commercial banks, SFIs, and government-owned \npawn shops. The government, through the Bank of Thailand, has introduced soft loans, and debt repayment deferral \nmeasures to ensure access to liquidity among individuals and SMEs. On 10 March 2020, the government announced the \nfollowing measures: (i) $4.8 billion in soft loans with an interest rate of 0.01% to commercial banks for onlending to \ncustomers at 2%; (ii) the Bank of Thailand eased measures for debt restructuring, debt-classification, and loan approval \nfor SMEs and debtors, and called for a lower minimum payment amount for credit-card holders (e.g. to 5% from the 10% \nceiling); and (iii) $0.95 billion in soft loans starting at a 3% interest rate for the Social Security Office\u2019s registered \nentrepreneurs to promote employment. On 24 March 2020, the government extended several concessions to individuals \nand SMEs affected by COVID-19, including: (i) personal loans including a B10,000 emergency loan per person at a \nmonthly interest of 0.1% (no collateral); (ii) a B50,000 special loan per person at a monthly interest (with collateral) of \n0.35%, and loans from state-owned charge pawnshops loan at a monthly interest of 0.125%; and (iii) loans up to  \nB3 million for SMEs at 3% interest rate over the first two years. \n \nCorporate bond stabilization fund. The disruption of economic activities together with heightened volatilities in global \nfinancial markets have also impacted the Thai financial market. If the corporate bond market cannot function properly, or \ninvestors lose confidence during the period of heightened economic uncertainty, additional financing or rollover will be \nlimited and highly costly, even for high-quality firms. Therefore, there are risks that many corporations will experience a \nliquidity shortage and may not have enough capital to conduct normal business operations, which may become a systemic \nrisk. This will impact savers through intermediaries such as fixed-income funds, provident funds, saving cooperatives, the \nGovernment Pension Fund, and the Social Security Fund. To stabilize the corporate bond market and to provide a liquidity \n ", "Appendix 4  27 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nbackstop, the Bank of Thailand, and the Ministry of Finance, as part of Package 3, established a $12.7 billion Corporate \nBond Stabilization Fund (BSF). The fund aims to provide bridge financing to high-quality firms with bonds maturing during \n2020\u20132021, at higher-than-market \u2018penalty\u2019 rates. Eligible corporate bond issuers must meet a number of criteria \nincluding: (i) be at least investment grade, (ii) have raised the majority of their funding needs through other means such \nas bank loans or a capital increase, (iii) have a clear long-term financing plan, and (iv) meet other conditions as set out \nby the BSF\u2019s investment committee. In addition, if the issuers simultaneously offer secured bonds to the general public, \nthe bonds in which the BSF will invest must also be secured with collateral of equal or better quality to the collateral \npledged on the bonds sold to the general public. \n \nEconomic and social recovery program. The government allocated $12.9 billion for economic and social recovery \nprograms and projects, of which $12.0 billion will be for FY 2021.  Projects in FY 2021 will be financed by government \ninternal funds and/or by other development partners. The government identified 6 priority areas to support: (i) smart \nfarming; (ii) industry, trade, and investment; (iii) responsible tourism and services; (iv) economic recovery at community \nlevel; (v) projects to boost domestic consumption; and (vi) infrastructure development. To date, 31,801 projects, \namounting to $23.4 billion, were submitted to the Loan Fund Disbursement Consideration Committee for consideration. \nThe Committee will evaluate potential projects before submitting to the Cabinet in July 2020 for approval. \n \n3. Pre-shock record of  Thailand\u2019s macroeconomic conditions were favorable prior to the onset of COVID-19. The average annual GDP growth \ngenerally sound  rate was 3.4% during 2015\u20132019. The external headwind from the global trade tensions had tilted Thailand\u2019s growth \nmacroeconomic  trajectory toward the downside. As a result, Thailand\u2019s economy had a moderate 2.4% growth rate in 2019 after a strong \nmanagement  performance (4.2% in 2018). The lingering trade conflict and the slowdown in the world economy weighed on the demand \nfor Thai exports, causing investment and employment in export-oriented businesses to decline as well. Strengthening \ndomestic consumption provided growth momentum on the back of government stimulus measures. Inflation was \nmaintained at a low level of around 1.0% in 2016\u20132019. \n \nThe fiscal deficit has been kept at a healthy level, averaging 2.8% of GDP during 2015-2019, thereby providing ample \nfiscal space as a buffer against external shocks. The government ran a fiscal deficit equal to 2.6% of GDP in the fiscal \nyear 2019 (ending 30 September 2019). To strengthen the fiscal position, the government has embarked on several \nimportant reforms. To increase tax revenue, the Land and Property Tax Law and taxation of investment income from \nbonds through mutual funds were revised. The E-payment Law, effective from 2020, will prevent local online vendors \nfrom avoiding income taxes. On the expenditure side, the government has set out a plan to revise the eligibility criteria for \nlow-income earners, so that the welfare program is better targeted to the lower-income group. Government revenue \ncollection in fiscal year 2019 was 0.5% above the official target, and expenditure was 1.4% higher than the official target. \nThe average tax-to-GDP ratio was 16.6% during 2015\u20132019. During the same period, the public debt-GDP ratio was \nstable, ranging from 41.2% of GDP to 42.6% of GDP, significantly below the government\u2019s debt ceiling of 60% of GDP. \nExternal positions were strong, with a current account surplus averaging 7.9% of GDP during 2015\u20132019. Gross \ninternational reserves averaged $192 billion (41.4% of GDP) and cover more than nine months of exports during  \n2015\u20132019. As of end 2019, international reserves were reported at $224.3 billion, significantly above the IMF\u2019s Reserve \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nAdequacy Metric for emerging markets and 12 months of imports. Thai Baht had been stable (volatility around 4.6% \nduring 2015\u20132019) and had appreciated from B34.25/$1 in 2015 to B31.04/$1 in 2019, due to increases in non-residential \ninflows.  \n \nMonetary policy has been accommodative in line with modest inflation and the declining trends of interest rates in the \nglobal financial markets. In August 2019, the BOT cut the policy interest by 25 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%, \nrepresenting the first such cut since 2015. In December 2019, the cabinet approved the BOT\u2019s new headline inflation \ntarget of 1\ua7f73% for 2020 to replace the use of an annual average of headline inflation at 2.5% with a tolerance band of \n\u00b11.5%, which was in place since 2015. This new policy is attributed to structural factors for driving down prices, including \ntechnological advancements and the growth in e-commerce which reduced the costs of production, and an aging \npopulation. \n \nThailand\u2019s 40th-place global ranking for SDG is ahead of some OECD countries. It is the highest in the ASEAN, and \nThailand is one of the few countries in the region to have achieved the first SDG goal of ending poverty. Furthermore, its \nHDI, which measures long-term progress in three basic dimensions of human development (a long and healthy life, access \nto knowledge, and a decent standard of living), is 0.76 which places the country in the high human development category. \nMen and women have similar HDI levels (0.76 and 0.75), indicating a high gender development index of 0.996.  \n \nThe IMF\u2019s Staff Report for the 2019 Article IV Consultation noted that Thailand\u2019s robust policy framework and ample \nbuffers, created through government\u2019s judicious management of public finances, underpin its resilience to shocks. \nHowever, the IMF noted that external and domestic headwinds were challenging near-term growth prospects and \nencouraged the authorities to undertake an investment-led expansion through fiscal stimulus while preserving sufficient \nbuffers and ensuring fiscal sustainability. The IMF also emphasized the importance of better targeting social assistance \nto protect vulnerable households while minimizing distortions. The IMF also welcomed the decision to cut the policy rate \nby the Bank of Thailand and noted that Thailand\u2019s external position remained stronger than warranted by medium-term \nfundamental and desirable policies. The IMF agreed that financial stability risks appear contained. \n \n4. Structural reforms  Thailand has strong capacities for COVID-19 case detection, risk assessment, case investigation, laboratory diagnosis, \nclinical management, infection prevention and control, and risk communication. Thailand scores highly on measures \nunder the International Health Regulations, but some dimensions of pandemic preparedness remain weak, including \nmapping priority public health risks and utilizing resources, emergency response operations, and effective responses at \npoints of entry. Since April 2020, the government has shifted to targeted surveillance, active case finding among \nvulnerable groups, and detection at points of entry. To help reduce the risk of transmission and encourage utilization of \nhealthcare services, 27 hospitals are piloting telemedicine services for chronic illness management. \n \nThe government  has allocated  $1.8 billion for health relief measures, of which $1.4 billion is from the stimulus  package  \nand $0.4 billion is from the 2020 central budget reallocation (please see the discussion in \u201cCountercyclical development \nexpenditures\u201d above for more details on the allocations for health expenditures). Inter-agency coordination mechanisms \nhave been put in place to ensure effective coordination and monitoring of the evolving COVID-19 situation and \n ", "Appendix 4  29 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nimplementation  of  the stimulus  packages.  The  government  has  also  created  the Centre  for COVID-19 Situation \nAdministration, chaired by the Prime Minister, which includes the Medical and Public Health Emergency Centre under the \nMOPH. On 9 April 2020, to oversee the utilization of the $31.7 billion emergency borrowing, the Cabinet established the \nhigh-level project screening and monitoring committee, chaired by the Secretary-General of the National Economic and \nSocial Development Council, the Governor of the BOT, and Directors of the Fiscal Policy Office, Comptroller General\u2019s \nDepartment, Budget Department, and Public Debt Management Department of the MOF. The committee is required to \nreport the status of loan implementation to the Cabinet every quarter. The national pandemic influenza preparedness plan \nand guidelines for epidemic response are being updated.  \n \nADB continued its engagement with the MOPH to strengthen its preparedness for public health responses to COVID-19. \nIn February 2020, ADB provided $2 million in technical assistance resources to cover a rapid response to COVID-19 \noutbreak and to scale-up support to implement a One Health response to public health threats across GMS countries.e \nTo quickly operationalize the expanded support, an extraordinary meeting of the GMS Working Group on Health \nCooperation was held on 28 February 2020 to discuss ways to strengthen regional collaboration initiatives in light of \nCOVID-19 to address common capacity constraints hampering the effective response to COVID-19 both at the regional \nand national levels. ADB has also received an initial request from government to undertake research and knowledge \ndevelopment for vaccines.f  \n \n \n5. Debt sustainability  The IMF\u2019s Staff Report for the 2019 Article IV Consultation noted that Thailand was at low risk of debt distress. Thailand\u2019s \nexternal debt was projected to remain stable at 32% of GDP in 2019. Of this, short-term debt comprised 15.3% of GDP \nand over two-thirds of total external debt is held by the private sector. Over the medium-term, external debt was projected \nto remain contained at 32.5% of GDP until 2024, while debt service was expected to remain low at 6% of GDP. Under \nthe most extreme scenario where the Thai Baht depreciates by 30%, the external debt-GDP ratio would rise to 48%.  \n \nPrior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the public debt-GDP ratio was expected to increase from 41.2% in 2019 to 42.2% in \n2020, gradually reaching 45.1% in 2024. COVID-19 will affect the public debt-GDP ratio by (i) increasing the level of public \ndebt due to the higher budget deficit, and (ii) contracting GDP. ADB staff estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic will \nresult in an increase in the public debt-GDP ratio from 41.2% in 2019 to 48.7% in 2020 and 50.4% in 2021, thereafter \nrising more slowly to 51.2% at the end of the projection period in 2024. The CARES Program under the CPRO  \n($1.5 billion) is estimated to have a small impact, adding around 0.3 percentage points to the public debt-GDP ratio. The \nexisting debt ratio and projected public indebtedness, including the potential impact of the prospective pandemic response \noption borrowing, is sustainable as the ADB loans comprise a small portion of the country\u2019s overall financing needs. Under \nthe worst-case scenario where the government exhausts the borrowing headroom of B1 trillion in fiscal years 2020\ua7f72021 \nunder the Royal Decree on emergency borrowing, the public debt trajectories are closer to, but still below, the legal ceiling \nof 60% of GDP. Therefore, the medium-term public debt outlook remains sustainable. \n \n6. Coordination with  ADB has been in contact with the IMF on the impact of COVID-19 in Thailand, including spending needs on critical health \nInternational  facilities and supplies, support to workers and businesses in the informal sector, and social unrest issues related to a rise \nMonetary Fund.  in unemployment and shortages of food and medical supplies. ADB has coordinated with the IMF on the CARES Program \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nincluding the assessment of Thailand\u2019s macro and fiscal conditions. The IMF confirmed that: (i) the impact from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has taken a large toll on Thailand\u2019s economy and adds to the impact of the severe drought, delays \nin fiscal budget execution, and weak domestic demand conditions, (ii) the current account surplus is expected to decline \nin 2020, with large shocks to services and trade balance, and (iii) the uncertainty on the outlook is greater than usual, \nwith risks titled to the downside. Nevertheless, the IMF assessed that Thailand still has some fiscal space, with public \ndebt at sustainable level based on announced measures (below the 60% ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law). \n \nADB= Asian Development Bank, ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, B= baht, BOT = Bank of Thailand, CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure  Support,  CPRO  =  COVID-19  pandemic  response  option,  GDP  =  gross  domestic  product,  GMS  =  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  \nHDI = Human Development Index, IMF = International Monetary Fund, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOPH = Ministry of Public Health, OECD = Organization for Economic \nCo-operation and Development, PPE = personal protective equipment, SDG = Sustainable Development Goal, SET = Stock Exchange of Thailand, SFI = specialized \nfinancial institutions, SME = small- and medium-sized enterprise. \na https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html \nb WHO. 2020.
