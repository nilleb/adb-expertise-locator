Intra-Asian trade is growing almost twice as fast as \nglobal trade and now represents almost half of total trade for the regional economies. This \ndynamic economic environment presents unprecedented opportunities for regional cooperation, \nbut policymakers need better information about emergent trends to identify these opportunities \nand realize their potential for sustaining equitable growth. As the primary regional institution \nsupporting regional economic cooperation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) must strengthen \nits research capacity to support forward-looking strategies for more effective multilateralism. \nThis regional technical assistance1 (TA) is intended to develop long-term regional projection \ntools, implement them for scenario analyses, and disseminate the results to public and private \nstakeholders across the region. This activity will set an essential precedent for ADB to inform \nregional stakeholders and encourage regional policy dialogue based on the study's empirical \nresults. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the past two decades, intraregional trade, supported by rapidly expanding regional \ntrade arrangements and foreign direct investment flows to the region, has become a major \ndriver for economic growth in developing Asia. The private sector has mostly been at the \nforefront in expanding the potential of intraregional trade for economic growth, partly through \nvertical specialization of production processes. \n \n3.  More  recently,  the  region\u2019s  development  agenda  has  increasingly  moved  to  wider \nregional economic integration issues. Robust income growth in the region, the need to sustain \nstrong productivity increases, as well as slow progress in global trade negotiations, are some \nmain factors behind this trend to regional economic integration. Finally, the rapid development \nof the PRC economy, both as an export competitor and at the same time an immense export \nmarket opportunity for other countries in the region, has played a pivotal role in this process.  \n \n4.  Realizing the opportunities at hand, policymakers have increasingly provided added \nimpetus to the integration process by contemplating a number of regional and bilateral trade \nagreements, including with Japan, to take effect over the next two decades. Strong growth in \nregional trade supported by regional and bilateral free trade agreements will undoubtedly play a \ncentral role in the development of the Asian region over the medium and long term. Robust \nregional income and trade growth will in turn have a substantial impact on regional foreign direct \ninvestment flows, including for infrastructure development, and on global commodity prices. For \npolicymakers in Asian developing countries, obtaining a clear assessment of the potential for \nand impact of intraregional trade expansion in the development of the region over the long term \nis important. Such assessment will assist them in defining their strategic policy priorities over the \nlong term, and promote the achievement of multilateral development goal number 8, calling for \nan open, rule-based trading system.  \n \n5.  For ADB, a good strategic understanding of the context of its operations is crucial for \ndefining its future role. In pursuit of its strategic mission to reduce poverty and improve living \nconditions in developing Asia, and responding to this development challenge, ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework for 2000\u20132015 identifies support for regional cooperation and integration as \na  main  strategic  crosscutting  issue.  Such  support  needs  good  prior  understanding  of  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 October 2004. \n ", "2  \npotential of and constraints to regional cooperation and integration, and the corresponding \nissues involved. Promoting the role of the private sector is a second main crosscutting theme of \nthe strategic framework, and increasingly such promotion requires a wider regionally integrated \napproach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  To facilitate the process of regional cooperation and trade integration in Asia, the TA will \naim to make available to public and private stakeholders, as well as ADB, more accurate \ninformation on the potential for and impact of intraregional trade expansion in the development \nof  the  region.  To  achieve  this  purpose,  the  TA  will  deliver  three  key  outputs:  (i)  a  newly \ncalibrated  global  computable  general  equilibrium  model  with  Asian  regional  focus;  (ii)  an \nassessment of regional trade scenarios to 2020, including simulations of a variety of bilateral \nand regional trade agreements; and (iii) three research papers focusing on issues of regional \nsignificance in the area of trade. \n \n7.  The overall research program, which will result in a general report on regional trade \nscenarios, will comprise a number of subprograms. First, baseline trade and growth projections \nfor  the  region  up  to  2020  will  be  established.  Second,  against  this  baseline,  a  detailed \nquantitative  assessment  of  various  regional  and  bilateral  trade  agreements  over  the  2020 \nprojection horizon will be undertaken. The results of this assessment will be evaluated against \nthe  findings  of  previous  studies  focusing  on  global  trade  liberalization.  Cross-country \ncomparisons will be conducted. To the extent possible, regional groupings corresponding to \nADB operations will also be considered, to enable the results to be useful to the regional \ndepartments. Third, analyses of three key regional trade-related issues of particular relevance \nwill be prepared and policy conclusions drawn. The issues will be selected on the basis of \nrecent and ongoing analyses carried out in the Economics and Research Department (ERD) \nindicating their importance in the regional context over the long term, in conjunction with a peer \nreview group of academics and policymakers who will advise on the final design of these in-\ndepth studies. Tentatively, the following are earmarked for more in-depth analysis: (i) regional \nintegration and trade in agricultural products, because of its strong correlation with poverty \nreduction, importance in the Doha Round of World Trade Organization trade negotiations, and \nits impact on the potentially declining food security in Asia brought by expanding populations \nand economic growth; (ii) growth, intraregional trade, and commodity prices, because of recent \nincreasing  trends,  which  could  impact  on  Asia's  growth  prospects;  and  (iii)  regional \ninfrastructure  development  and  trade,  which  could  help  ADB  target  its  assistance  to  its \ndeveloping member countries. The draft outline of the project report is in Appendix 2. \n \n8.  The TA outputs are expected to contribute to enhancing policy dialogue on regional \ncooperation and economic integration among ADB's developing member countries by: \n \n(i)  providing  policymakers  with  a  clear  assessment  of  the  impact  and  potential \nbenefits and costs of different regional and bilateral free trade agreements; \n(ii)  providing policymakers and trade negotiators with quantitative information on the \nimpact of trade agreements; \n(iii)  providing  a  quantitative  assessment  of  the  sector  impact  of  free  trade \nagreements and allowing policymakers to prioritize sector policies; \n(iv)  providing  an  assessment  of  the  potential  benefits  of  greater  regional  and \nsubregional integration for agricultural specialization and trade; and \n ", "  3\n(v)  providing  an  assessment  of  the  benefits  of  regional  and  subregional \ninfrastructure  investment  for  intraregional  trade  and  investment,  allowing  for \nprioritization of such investments. \n \n9.  The TA will also assist ADB in defining its strategic priorities and role in the area of \nregional cooperation and integration by providing an assessment of ADB\u2019s regional operational \nenvironment  up  to  2020.  This  would  help  ADB  prioritize  operations  in  support  of  regional \ncooperation and integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The research will quantitatively develop a number of scenarios for Asian growth and \ntrade until 2020 based on a global computable general equilibrium model. The model takes into \naccount  interdependencies  between  markets  of  different  goods  and  productive  factors  in \ndifferent regions. By substituting the alternative development of exogenous variables, such as \ndemography, institutions, trade barriers, and technology, simulations of alternative economic \ndevelopment  in  a  consistent  macroeconomic  framework  will  be  undertaken.  Rather  than \npredicting the future economic conditions with accuracy, the quantitative assessment allows the \nexploration of the impacts of different policy and growth scenarios on trade and growth patterns, \nand gauges the relative importance of various driving forces and key uncertainties that might \ninfluence outcomes.  \n \n11.  While a number of studies have already been undertaken using global computable \ngeneral equilibrium models, previous research has generally focused on the impact of global \ntrade liberalization based on commitments made under the World Trade Organization. This \nresearch, meanwhile, will focus on the impact of changing intraregional trade flows within Asia. \nTrade flow projections between some of developing Asia\u2019s main growth poles, namely PRC, \nIndia, Japan, Republic of Korea, and member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations will be at the core of the research project. Consideration will also be given to expansion \nof these mainstream growth poles across the region, and the implications for more equitable \nregional development. The data will be calibrated based on a combination of official national \nstatistics  and  internationally  standardized  trade  data.  As  part  of  the  TA,  the  model \nimplementation and data requirements will be fully documented to allow for regular model and \ndata updates. \n \n12.  The  TA  intends  to  partner  closely  with  the  ADB  Institute,  the  Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the \nWorld Bank (Development Prospects Group) to learn from each other's experiences, avoid \noverlap, and maximize complementarities. For instance, in the past few years, trade between \ndeveloping Asia and Latin America has been growing rapidly in both directions, and indications \nare that over the projection horizon, foreign direct investment between the two regions will \nsurge. Toward the end of the TA, a high-level international conference on Asian economic \nintegration and interregional trade is planned. The conference is to be cosponsored by the \nconcerned research partners. Preliminary work on the model to be used in the analysis has also \nbeen initiated in collaboration with the World Bank. \n \n13.  The following major activities are the milestones for the TA:  \n \n(i)  Using  the  Global  Trade  Analysis  Project  (GTAP)  database,  develop  and \nimplement a new regional projection model.  \n \n ", "4  \n(ii)  Evaluate baseline scenarios for the evolution of regional trade during 2005\u20132020, \nincluding the effects of a variety of possible regional trade agreements. \n \n(iii)  Disseminate  the  study  results  in  seminars  at  three  Asian  capitals,  through \npartnerships  with  local  counterpart  economists  who  will  assess  the  national \nimplications of the projected regional trends. \n \n(iv)  Produce three illustrative case studies with the new methodology, tentatively on \ntopics  such  as  regional  integration  and  trade  in  agricultural  products, \nintraregional  trade  and  commodity  prices,  and  regional  infrastructure \ndevelopment and trade. \n \n(v)  Organize, at the conclusion of implementation, a high-level regional conference \nto discuss the baseline scenario results and evaluate alternative topics for more \nintensive regional research. \n \n(vi)  Organize a high-level international conference to discuss regional trends in a \nglobal context, promote standards for more empirically grounded policy dialogue, \nand evaluate alternative topics for more intensive regional research. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. ERD, with the Macroeconomics and \nFinance Research Division (ERMF) as the coordinating unit, will implement the TA. The TA is \nexpected to commence in December 2004 and be completed by December 2006. Developing \nthe  models  will  be  a  collaborative  exercise  involving  ERMF  economists,  an  international \nconsultant, and selected national experts in the regional economies. This approach will ensure \nsustained capacity in ERMF and continuity of the investment in modeling work.  \n \n16.  Implementation will be handled by a TA secretariat, consisting of a TA supervising unit \nofficer, an economics officer, and an administrative assistant. The main responsibilities of the \nsecretariat are to (i) facilitate the engagement of international and domestic consultants required \nto conduct the study, (ii) plan and manage all seminars and conferences related to the study, \nand (iii) help produce and disseminate the TA results.  \n \n17.  For TA implementation, one international consultant on modeling (90 person-days) and \nfour domestic trade consultants (2.5 person-months each) will be engaged. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged by \nADB in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and \nits Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \n18.  Three dissemination seminars are tentatively scheduled for May-June 2005. These will \nbe 1\u20132 day seminars, participated in by ERMF staff and the international consultant. Possible \nvenues are Bangkok, Beijing, and New Delhi. High-level regional and international conferences \n ", "  5\n(one each) are also being planned, possibly at ADB headquarters. The study results will be \ncirculated to the relevant departments for their information and comments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.
