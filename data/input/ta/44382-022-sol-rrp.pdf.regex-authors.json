THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Solomon Islands for the Broadband for Development \nProject.1 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Geography  and  economy.  Solomon  Islands  is  one  of  the  largest  countries  in \nMelanesia, with a land area of about 28,000 square kilometers. The country comprises six large \nislands,  dozens  of  smaller  islands,  and  hundreds  of  islets  and  atolls.  About  85%  of  the \npopulation of 550,000 lives in rural areas spread across the islands, living in widely dispersed \nvillages, most of which have a few hundred inhabitants. The economy is based on primary \ncommodities from agriculture, forestry, and fishing; alternative income-generating opportunities \nare scarce, especially in rural areas. \n \n3.  Disparity and isolation. Solomon Islands has the second-lowest average income in the \nregion, with an estimated gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $1,347 in 2010 (current \nprices).  Income  distribution  is  uneven,  with  rural  expenditure  levels  significantly  below \nexpenditure levels in urban areas. Social indicators are improving, but remain among the worst \nin the region. Electricity, water, transport, and telecommunication services are not available to a \nlarge percentage of the population.2 Lack of access to markets and services,3 combined with \nhigh transport and communication costs, leaves much of the geographically isolated portion of \nthe country economically isolated from national and regional markets.4 These factors also limit \nprovision of access to basic services, a situation which is exacerbated by the lack of affordable, \nfast and reliable data traffic. Investments in submarine cables for the smaller islands of the \nPacific have meanwhile been limited, primarily due to (i) the requirement for large up-front \ncapital investments, (ii) a long period of return on investments, and (iii) the inability of the small \nprivate sector to mobilize the large investment that is required. \n \n4.  Expected benefits from broadband connectivity. Such constraints to economic and \nsocial  development  can  be  mitigated  by  improved  access  to  more  affordable \ntelecommunications, particularly high-speed (broadband) internet, that offers new economic \nopportunities domestically, as well as connections to larger markets, and new avenues for the \ndelivery of key social services.5 In addition to the expected positive socioeconomic impact in \nSolomon Islands, improved broadband connectivity is also expected to increase the frequency \nand quality of communications among the countries in the region, facilitating a growth in trade-\nrelated services such as tourism and back-office functions. A recent World Bank study indicates \nthat a 10% increase in broadband penetration results in a 1.38% increase in GDP growth in low- \nand  middle-income  countries.6 Such  impacts  result  from  (i)  reduced  transaction  costs  for \nbusiness, government, and household communications; (ii) new business opportunities such as \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The project is phase 2 of the Pacific Regional Information \nand Communications Project, which seeks to improve connectivity in selected Pacific countries. Under phase 1, \nADB and the World Bank supported the development of a submarine cable system (SCS) linking Tonga to Fiji \n(ADB 2011. Tonga-Fiji Submarine Cable Project. Manila). \n2  Solomon Islands has also been identified as a core fragile state since 2007. \n3  Government of Solomon Islands. 2011. National Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020.

", "2 \ninvestments  in  e-commerce  and  business  process  outsourcing  facilities;  and  (iii)  improved \npublic service delivery, in particular through (a) the introduction of e-education and e-health \nservices;  (b)  the  remote  delivery  of  agricultural  extension,  policing,  judicial,  employment, \ndisaster management and other public services; and (c) mobile banking. As an immediate result \nof the SCS, wholesale bandwidth prices are expected to halve, leading to a conservatively \nestimated retail price reduction of 20%.   \n \n5.  Telecommunications market.  Solomon Islands introduced a second mobile operator in \n2010, and competition has already resulted in a 29% reduction in mobile telephony prices and \nan  improvement  in the  quality  of  services. 7 Access  to  affordable, good  quality  broadband \ninternet-based services, however, has so far remained out of reach (Table 1). The limited \ncapacity and high cost of international bandwidth is caused by a total dependence on satellite \nconnectivity,  which  is  also  the  principal  constraint  to  higher  broadband  penetration,  the \nintroduction of new telecommunications services, and new market entrants. \n \nTable 1: Market Indicators \n Item  2009  2011 \nMobile network     \nSubscribers  57,000  274,872  \nPenetration rate (%)  11  53 \nNetwork coverage (%)  10  67 \nInternet / broadband     \nSubscribers   1,276  21,133  \nPenetration rate (%)  <1  4 \nSource: Telecommunications Commission of Solomon Islands. 2012. Annual Report 2011. Honiara. \n \n6.  The 2012 wholesale price for two-way satellite capacity is roughly $3,600 per megabit \nper second (Mbps) per month. With normal growth, bandwidth demand in Solomon Islands is \nprojected to increase to 1.243 gigabits per second (Gbps) by 2032. It would be impossible to \nmeet the growing demand using the current satellite capacity and price. The submarine cable \nsystem (SCS) will provide substantially higher initial capacity of 10 Gbps and is expected to \nreduce international connectivity costs by more than 60%.8 In 2012, the cheapest broadband \ninternet subscription costs roughly $60 per month, which is about 28% of average monthly \nincome (approximated using GDP per capita in 2010).  \n \n7.  Government policy and strategy. Following endorsement of the government\u2019s debt \nmanagement strategy in June 2012, Solomon Islands is resuming its first borrowing since 2005. \nThe government considers the SCS a national asset and an immediate investment priority, thus \nrecognizing the potentially significant contribution that improved broadband connectivity can \nmake  in  addressing  the  constraints  imposed  by  geographic  and  economic  isolation,  and \npromoting inclusive growth. 9 The Government is currently developing a national ICT strategy, \nwhich is expected to be adopted by 31 December 2013. \n \n8.  Asian Development Bank (ADB), development partner, and private sector support. \nSupporting inclusive growth and investment in information and communication technology are \nimportant elements of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach (which provides broad operational focus) and the \ncountry operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Solomon Islands.10 ADB\u2019s sovereign financing \nhas leveraged roughly $33 million of commercial financing for the Solomons Oceanic Cable \n                                                \n7  Telecommunications Commission of Solomon Islands. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nCompany  (SOCC),  thereby  minimizing  public  debt  liabilities.  ADB\u2019s  investment  support  is \ncomplemented  by  World  Bank  technical  assistance  to  support  the  Telecommunications \nCommission of Solomon Islands, which has regulatory responsibility for telecommunications, \nand the Ministry of Communication and Aviation, which is developing a national ICT strategy.11  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased broadband-based economic opportunities, and broadband-\nbased improvements in the inclusive delivery of social services. The outcome will be that the \npopulation of Solomon Islands increasingly uses good quality broadband internet services at \naffordable prices.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The  output  will  be  a  fully  operational  Solomon  Islands  SCS,  linked  to  an  existing \ninternational submarine cable network that runs between Guam and Sydney (PIPE Pacific \nCable 1, or PPC-1).12  An international spur13 into Guadalcanal (landing in Honiara) and two \ndomestic spurs linking Guadalcanal with Malaita (landing in Auki) and the Western Province \n(landing in Noro) will have jointly opened telecommunications access to roughly 72% of the \ncountry\u2019s population. The SCS is expected to be ready for service by December 2013, operated \nby the SOCC.  \n  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $60 million.14 The financing is structured to include Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) loan and grant funds, commercial financing, and equity brought in by \nSOCC. ADB sovereign financing and SOCC equity cover about 50% of the total financing \nrequired for the project, while SOCC is in an advanced stage of negotiations over commercial \ndebt financing. The investment plan is summarized in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual.15  \n \n12.   To demonstrate the government priority and commitment to foster the private sector led \noperation of the SCS, and to help leverage the required commercial funds, the government \nrequested a loan from the ADB in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n(SDR) 6,997,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft financing and project agreements. Under the recently endorsed debt \nmanagement  strategy,16 Solomon  Islands  can  only  afford  to  take  on  limited  borrowing. \nTherefore, the government has also requested a grant not exceeding $7.5 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the project. The financing plan is in Table 3. \n \n                                                \n11 As anchored in the Telecommunications Act, 2009. \n12 Submarine Cable Map. http://www.submarinecablemap.com/  \n13  PIPE Networks (the owners of PPC-1) have confirmed in writing that connecting the international spur must \ncoincide with repair work on PPC-1 for which the cable needs to be lifted (scheduled for July 2013).  Consequently, \nnot meeting this timeline poses a major risk to the project, including the economic loss of existing investments.  \n14 Inclusive of $6.3 million taxes and duties on capital goods, which is expected to be exempted by the government.  \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Finance and Treasury. 2012.

This means that more than 50% of the project is commercially financed.  \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan19 \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Fund (loan)  10.5    17 \nAsian Development Fund (grant)    7.5    13 \nCommercial debt  25.7    43 \nSolomons Oceanic Cable Company (equity)  10.0    17 \nGovernment of Solomon Islands (taxes and duties exemption)  6.3    11 \n  Total    60.0    100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the executing agency responsible for the \noverall  administration  of  the  project.  SOCC  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  SOCC  was \n                                                \n17 Exclusive of the following non-core project funding: (i) Senior Secured Loan of $2 million (Debt Service Reserve \nAccount); (ii) Senior Secured Loan of $1 million (Maintenance Reserve Account); (iii) Senior Secured Contingent \nConstruction Facility of $3 million); and (iv) Senior Secured Revolving Working capital Facility of $1 million), all of \nwhich will be financed through the commercial debt component. Transport and insurance costs may be financed by \nADB. \n18 The draft terms and conditions, which are subject to ADB endorsement, are (i) 4% interest over the loan \ncomponent; (ii) 1.5% interest over the grant component; (iii) 25-year payback period, inclusive of a grace period of \n8 years. This will be formalized in a subsidiary loan agreement between the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and \nSOCC. \n19 The financing plan is firm in terms of its structure, and negotiations between the prospective commercial financiers, \nMoFT and SOCC are at an advanced stage (a signed common term sheet is expected to be in place by 14 \nSeptember). Financial closing of the commercial lending is expected by the end of November, 2012. \n ", "5 \nincorporated under the Companies Act, 2009 on 15 September 2011.20 SOCC is currently \nowned  by  the  Solomon  Islands  National  Provident  Fund  and  Solomon  Telekom  Company \nLimited.

SOCC\u2019s corporate governance arrangements are defined in its company rules. SOCC is \ngoverned by a board comprising four directors, and currently led by a chief executive officer \n(CEO) with a long experience in the submarine cable industry (including 10 years as CEO of the \nAustralia\u2013Japan Cable). The board is currently assisted by an experienced financial adviser (a \nformer ANZ staff member). A core SOCC team\u2014consisting of the CEO, a head of engineering, \nand an office manager\u2014will be based in Honiara to manage network construction and establish \nongoing marketing and operations. Once a stable operating environment is established, the \nCEO role will be merged with the head of engineering. The following operational and business \nfunctions will be outsourced: marine maintenance, the Network Operations Centre, landing \nstation management, project management, information technology support, financial accounting, \nauditing and legal services.  \n \n16.  The lack of an established  procurement unit in SOCC poses a risk to the project. \nMitigation measures include (i) intense support from ADB in the preparation of bid documents; \n(ii)  establishment  of  a bid  evaluation  committee,  comprising  SOCC\u2019s CEO  and  two  highly \n                                                \n20 Company Haus of Solomon Islands. http://www.companyhaus.gov.sb/app/viewInstance/413487 \n ", "6 \nexperienced consultants from the industry; (iii) strict review of the bid evaluation report by the \nADB; and (iv) the establishment of a records management system at SOCC. \n \n17.  Advance action will be required for procurement of the indefeasible right of use (direct \nprocurement) and the domestic spurs (international competitive bidding). Retroactive financing \nmay be required to ensure mobilization payments to the suppliers of the domestic spurs.  \n \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  The insertion of a new branching unit on PPC-1 with a cable spur to Honiara has been \nselected as the most feasible and least-cost international option (Table 5). Landing sites in \nHoniara, Noro, and Auki were selected based on the suitability of the shoreline, availability of \nland,  and  minimum  disruption  to the  marine  environment  and  human  activities. The  cable \nlanding stations and auxiliary facilities will be located by arrangement with Solomon Telekom \nCompany Limited in their existing secure telecommunication facilities near each landing site. \n \nTable 5: Summary of International Cable Routes Considered \nCapital expenditurea  \nOption  ($ million)  Recommendation \nCable to a new branching unit on PPC-1   30.0  Selected as best overall option \nCable to Coolum, Australia  60.7   Eliminated due to much higher cost  \nCable to Vanuatu  44.5   Eliminated due higher cost and need for \nonward connection via Fiji \nSpur to an existing Telikom PNG-owned  39.2   Would be second choice but carries \nBU3 on PPC-1  significant risk of execution failure \nBU3 = branch unit 3, PNG = Papua New Guinea, PPC-1 = PIPE Pacific Cable 1. \na Estimates include indefeasible right of use and required permits. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  SOCC will obtain all permits required for the international and domestic cables. Once the \ndetailed cable route for the domestic spurs is confirmed by a marine survey, the government \ncan, if necessary, declare the cable-passing area as no-anchor zone for shipping to avoid any \ndamage from vessel activity. The viability of the system will be ensured by choosing only proven \nsubmarine cable technology from well-established and reputable suppliers. A small number of \ntechnical support staff will be fully trained in the operation of the system before the anticipated \nready-for-service date (December 2013).  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  As an immediate result of the project, i.e., reduced prices, users of existing mobile \nservices  (voice  and  data)  will  enjoy  an  increase  in  their  consumer  surplus.  Increased \naffordability will also lead to an increase in the number of new users. Wholesale bandwidth \nprices are expected to halve, more or less, leading to a conservatively estimated retail price \nreduction  of  20%.  Other  benefits  may  be  substantial  but  are  more  difficult  to  analyze \nquantitatively. They include (i) the improved efficiency and quality of public service delivery \nthrough the introduction of broadband based delivery modalities; (ii) reduction in the cost of \ndoing business, resulting in efficiency gains for the private sector; (iii) mobile banking; and (iv) \nincremental economic growth.  \n21.  Benefits  are  assumed to  increase  over time  as  the  population grows  and  incomes \nincrease. Projected GDP growth is applied to the benefits computed in the first year the cable \n ", "7 \ncomes into service. In the first year it is assumed that 50% of the computed benefits will actually \naccrue to beneficiaries, increasing to 100% in the third year. The project appears to be highly \nsocially profitable, with a projected economic rate of return of 37%.     \n22.  The cost of SOCC equity was assumed to be 15%, and the cost of commercial debt \n6.5%. ADB\u2019s grant and loan to the government will be onlend to SOCC at a blended rate of \n2.95%. The resulting weighted average cost of capital is 3.75%. The financial internal rate of \nreturn is 22%, calculated using a 15% hurdle rate over 18 years, including the construction \nperiod of 2 years. This far exceeds the estimated cost of capital and clearly indicates the \nfinancial viability of the project.21 As the project is for a revenue-generating entity, a discount \nrate of 15% was used for the net present value to examine commercial viability. The financial \nevaluation indicates that the project has a healthy net present value, which only becomes \nnegative when revenue decreases by 15% or more. \n   \nC.  Governance \n23.  Public  financial  management  and  procurement.  The  main  public  financial \nmanagement risk concerns the capacity of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to appropriately \nonlend and administer the loan and grant proceeds to SOCC. This risk is mitigated by (i) the \ncurrent and ongoing capacity development support to the debt management unit within the \nministry; and (ii) ADB making direct payments to the suppliers of the domestic spurs and the \nIRU.22 Wider support for the strengthening of public financial management is provided through \nthe ongoing Economic Recovery Support Program (Subprogram 2).23  \n \n24.  At the project level, a financial assessment conducted of the implementing agency found \nthe project\u2019s overall risk profile to be moderate, mitigated by the appointment of a firm of \naccountants and an office manager and bookkeeper to ensure transactions are appropriately \nclassified  and  a  set  of  accounts  maintained.  In  addition,  SOCC  will  recruit  two  highly \nexperienced consultants to assist in managing the procurement process (bid documents are \nprepared as part of project preparatory technical assistance). Annual audits will be performed by \na locally recruited firm.   \n \n25.  The risk of excessive and/or unproductive borrowing by the government is mitigated by \nthe endorsement of a debt management strategy in June 2012. The strategy comes with clear \nobjectives for debt management and  provides a framework for the government to resume \nprudent  borrowing  for  projects  that  provide  revenue  or  key  infrastructure  to  increase  the \nwellbeing of Solomon Islanders. Finally, the government will onlend to SOCC, so the primary \ndebt servicing responsibility rests with the implementing agency.  \n \n26.  Corruption.  Reports  on  corruption  throughout  the  public  service  persist.  However, \nsubstantial progress has been made in developing institutional capacity to address corruption \nfollowing  the  arrival  in  2003  of  the  Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands  and \nreestablishment of law and order. This is reflected in the World Bank\u2019s governance indicator for \nthe control of corruption, which shows a marked improvement from 5.9 in 2003 to 38.8 in \n2010.24   \n                                                \n21 The availability of a sovereign component in the financing plan has been crucial in securing the equity and \ncommercial debt shares. \n22 Regional  Assistance  Mission  to  Solomon  Islands.

Solomon Telekom Company Limited, which is one of the two retail \nproviders, owns a 49% share in SOCC, which poses the risk of preferential treatment. This risk \nis mitigated through the implementation of the Telecommunications Act, 2009 as overseen by \nthe Telecommunications Commission of Solomon Islands. The existence of the act and the \ncontinued presence of a fully operational telecommunications commission should provide the \nnecessary assurance, by intervention if needed, that the owners and operator of the SCS will \nprovide wholesale capacity on a fair and equitable basis to all its wholesale customers and that \nthe availability of much lower-cost, higher-quality broadband internet is passed on to businesses, \ngovernment, and consumers. As an additional risk mitigation measure, SOCC will publish a \nreference offer, setting out standard terms and conditions under which wholesale services will \nbe provided.   \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.25 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  In addition to wider socioeconomic benefits discussed above, the immediate contribution \nof  the  project  to  the  country\u2019s  social  and  poverty  profile  lies  in  a  substantial  decrease  in \ntelecommunication costs, leading to a greater affordability of services to wider segments of the \npopulation,  in  particular  those  who  are  geographically  and  economically  isolated  and \ndisadvantaged (wholesale bandwidth prices are expected to halve, leading to a conservatively \nestimated  retail  price  reduction  of  20%).  ADB  will  also  provide  parallel  support  to  the \nGovernment  to  realize  the  expected  socio-economic  and  poverty  benefits,  through  the \ndevelopment of broadband applications in the delivery of critical public services, including health \nand education services. 26 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts were assessed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Proposed cable laying and minor \ncivil works will not result in any significant adverse environmental or social impacts, and all \npotential  environmental  impacts  can  be  adequately  mitigated  and  managed  and  will  be \nmonitored. An initial environmental examination, incorporating an environmental management \nplan, has been prepared for the project.27 The project is classified as environmental category B. \nThe project does not involve any physical displacement, and no indigenous people issues have \nbeen identified. The cable will be laid along existing road and property boundaries on public, \ncustomary, and private land. Land access and easements across customary and private land \nwill be obtained through negotiated agreements with the respective land owners, guided by the \nresettlement plan prepared in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement.28 The project is \nclassified under involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples category C. The \nsafeguard documents will be endorsed by the government and SOCC, disclosed locally by \nSOCC, and posted on the ADB website.    \n \n                                                \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 In addition, the 2011 country performance assessment highlights critical weaknesses in the area of social inclusion \nand the effectiveness of the public administration.   \n27  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 Significant project risk arises from the fact \nthat  the  connection  of  the  international  spur  to  PPC-1  must  coincide  with  the  scheduled \nmaintenance of PPC-1 in July 2013. A delay in any of the key project milestones\u2014especially a \ndelay in the award or execution of contracts, a failure to obtain timely commercial cofinancing \nresources for the project, or a delay in disbursements\u2014could mean that the project is not \nimplemented at all or that the economic value of certain project expenditures would be severely \nimpaired. All parties involved in the project are keenly aware of this risk and are making every \neffort to adhere to project milestones so as to mitigate this delay risk. The integrated benefits \nand impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in project preparation  Strict process management, and strict adherence by all parties to preparation \nlead to missing the engineering  milestones, to ensure that the deadline is met \ndeadline of July 2013 to install \nthe branching unit on PPC-1 \nGovernment highly vulnerable  The  project is  private  sector-led,  through equity  contributions  by  SOCC,  and \nto excessive borrowing  gearing with commercial debt.
