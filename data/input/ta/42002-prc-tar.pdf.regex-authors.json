Promotion of balanced development is a key strategic objective of the Government of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  Accordingly,  to  narrow  regional  disparities  in \ndevelopment  the  Government  is  shifting  the  focus  of  its  development  promotion  from  the \neastern  provinces  to  the  relatively  underdeveloped  interior  provinces.  Henan's  provincial \ngovernment  is  eager  to  take  advantage  of  this  shift  in  policy  and  intends  to  utilize  fiscal \ninstruments to accelerate the rate of growth in the province. To achieve this objective, the \nGovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) \nfor  Fiscal  Policy  Support  for  Economic  Development  in  Henan.1 The  Henan  government \nproposes to use ADB TA resources to prepare a fiscal policy blueprint, based on analysis and \nin-depth background studies, focusing on the use of fiscal instruments, including those relating \nto expenditure structure optimization. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Henan Province is located in the central region of the PRC, and is the country\u2019s most \npopulous province, with over 92 million inhabitants, or about 7.5% of the national population. \nPer capita income in Henan province is below the national average, and the economy is \ndominated by agriculture, mining, and traditional manufacturing, with a relatively small services \nsector. Henan Province is an important producer of farm products, 3 and has two oil fields, coal \nmines, and is rich in nonferrous minerals. The province's manufacturing sector is concentrated \nin six largely traditional industrial sectors\u2014petrochemicals, food processing, nonferrous metals, \nautomobiles, textiles, and machinery. With foreign trade constituting a mere 10% of provinces\u2019 \ngross domestic product (GDP), Henan's economy is not as open as those of many other \nprovinces.  Henan  has  not  been  successful  in  attracting  a  significant  volume  of  foreign \ninvestment. \n \n3.  Structural  weaknesses  in  the  economy,  underdeveloped  external  linkages  and  a \nrelatively weak private sector presence contribute to Henan\u2019s comparative underdevelopment. \nDue to the preponderance of agriculture, mining and traditional industries in the economy, the \ntax base is moderately narrow and fiscal performance relatively weak. The province raises only \n1.8% of the nation's fiscal revenues, although it has a 6% share of national GDP. Consequently, \nthe province\u2019s own sources of revenue cover only 45% of its total spending, resulting in a \nsignificant reliance on central transfers, which are received in the form of shared taxes, special \npurpose  (earmarked)  grants,  general  block  grants,  and  policy-based  grants  to  implement \ncentrally sponsored programs of national importance. \n \n4.  Modernization  of  the  agriculture  sector,  which  has  an  important  place  in  Henan's \neconomy,  is  a  major  issue.  Although  it  contributes  only  about  16.5%  of  provincial  GDP, \nagriculture remains a major source of support to about two-thirds of the province's population, \nwhich resides in rural areas. There is considerable scope for raising agricultural productivity \nthrough the introduction of new technologies and enhanced use of modern farm inputs and \npractices.  In  recent  years,  the  provincial  government  has  also  promoted  leading  private \nenterprises linked to the farm sector through incentives rather than through direct participation in \nproduction,  as  in  the  past.  The  provincial  government  is  keen  to  further  strengthen  this \nincentive-based approach. \n                                                 \n1  The TA is included in the 2008 TA program for the PRC. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 April 2008. \n3  Major farm products include wheat, corn, oilseeds, and cotton. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The industrial sector contributes about 54% of provincial GDP. The province has a \nsignificant mining industry but profitability is low, in part because of centrally controlled output \nprices. Within the manufacturing sector, petrochemicals, food processing, textiles, nonferrous \nmetals, automobiles and parts, and machinery are major industries. State-owned enterprises \n(SOEs)  account  for  the  bulk  of  manufacturing  and  mining  enterprises,  and  these  were \ntraditionally responsible for providing many social services. Although many of these social \nresponsibilities have been divested from SOEs since 2004, SOE reforms remain a major fiscal \nissue for the provincial government. The government is eager to reduce the number of SOEs, \nwhich  is  expected  to  fall  from  5,000  in  2007  to  4,500  in  2008.  The  government  is  also \ncontemplating other reforms such as separating the supervision function from the State Asset \nSupervision  and  Administration  Commission,  which  controls  SOE  ownership.  The  Finance \nDepartment intends to pursue deeper reforms in the sector, focused on the creation of an \nenvironment conducive to private sector investment.  \n \n6.  Due to its central location Henan serves as a major transit hub, particularly for railways, \nbut it lags behind other provinces in infrastructure penetration. Infrastructure is currently funded \nfrom several sources, including tolls and central funds, which the central Government raises by \nissuing bonds. These are provided to provincial and local governments in the form of grants for \nnon-remunerative infrastructure, and as loans for remunerative projects. Additional funds are \nraised from banks and multilateral institutions. In addition to investing, the Finance Department \nis responsible for (i) due diligence to ensure project viability, (ii) effective project implementation, \nand (iii) prudent use of funds. The government is eager to study other ways of using fiscal \ninstruments to stimulate infrastructure investment, including from the private sector.  \n \n7.  The provincial government places strategic importance on promoting the services sector \nas an environmentally sustainable means of generating employment and export earnings. In this \nregard,  the  government  seeks  to  assess  where  Henan  Province  enjoys  a  comparative \nadvantage, and the potential for development of a modern services industry through the use of \nfiscal instruments. Henan Province is a cradle of Chinese civilization and has a number of \nancient heritage sites of archeological importance, many of which are either underdeveloped or \nin the state of disrepair. Development of these sites would serve to both preserve the province\u2019s \nrich  cultural  heritage  and  enhance  its  attractiveness  as  a  destination  for  domestic  and \ninternational tourists. The government considers the services sector as having tremendous \npotential for generating employment and export revenues, with minimal adverse environmental \nimpacts. \n \n8.  The provincial government would also like to use fiscal instruments to promote energy-\nefficient  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth.  It  is  critical  that  Henan  move \ntowards  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  province\u2019s  relatively  high \ndependency on energy- and raw material-intensive industries and on agriculture provides a \nsignificant challenge to the government in designing and implementing incentive-compatible \npolicies to induce sustainable development. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved economic performance of Henan, relative to the \nnational average, that is grounded in a better understanding of key fiscal constraints to inclusive ", "  3\nand sustainable growth. The outcome of the TA will be a superior fiscal policy regime that will \nease binding constraints on sustainable growth in key sectors of Henan\u2019s economy. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have two groups of outputs:   \n \n(i)  A  Strategic  Report  on  Fiscal  Policy  for  Accelerating  Economic \nDevelopment in Henan. The report will review the overall economic structure of \nHenan Province, analyze the interaction between fiscal policy and economic \ngrowth,  diagnose  impediments  and  key  constraints  to  growth,  and  identify \nremedial fiscal policy measures to remove impediments to sustainable growth, \nexports, and employment. It will also identify lessons for other provinces where \npossible. \n(ii)  A series of five background papers on the topics indicated below, to provide \nnecessary inputs for the strategic report in (i) above. The papers will cover the \nfollowing subjects: \n \n(a)  Overview study: improving sustainable livelihoods and promoting a \nharmonious society. The paper will analyze how fiscal policy can be used \nto enhance access to employment, education, health, and social security \nwith the goal of promoting harmonious development of agriculture, industry \nand services; will make policy recommendations to remove existing fiscal \nimpediments  to  sustainable  growth;  and  study  the  fiscal  management \nstrengths of the Henan government.  \n \n(b)  Industrial and infrastructure development and market transformation. \nThe  paper  will  study  fiscal  policies  for  (1)  reforming  SOEs  in  six  key \nindustrial  sectors\u2014food  processing,  petrochemicals,  nonferrous  metals, \nautomobiles  and  parts,  machine  tools,  and  textiles\u2014with  a  view  to \nattracting private investment and modern technology into these sectors; \n(2) restructuring and modernizing basic manufacturing (industries producing \nraw materials), mining, energy (with special focus on hydropower), and \ntransportation; (3) opening up Henan\u2019s economy to external markets and \nthe private sector with a view to promoting competition and investment; and \n(4) introducing fiscal instruments for promoting resource conservation and \nenergy efficiency and to protect the environment and biodiversity. \n \n(c)  Modernization  of  the  services  sector.  The  paper  will  (i)  review  the \ncomparative advantage of Henan Province based on its human and natural \nendowments  and  linkages  to  rest  of  the  economy,  with  a  view  to \ndiversifying into a modern services sector; (ii) based on the comparative \nadvantages, identify specific sectors and activities that could be promoted; \nand (iii) propose a fiscal strategy to stimulate the development of a modern \nservices sector in Henan. \n \n(d)  Preservation of cultural resources. Henan has a rich cultural heritage \nand a number of ancient cultural sites and classical forms of fine arts. This \nheritage has the potential to attract both national and international visitors, \nbut is currently not fully exploited due to access impediments. The paper \n ", "4   \nwill prepare a fiscal blueprint to preserve and develop the cultural heritage \nof Henan Province.  \n \n(e)  Fiscal strategy for export promotion. Henan Province\u2019s weak external \ntrade linkages are seen as a major impediment to growth by the provincial \ngovernment. Development policy would seek to increase the potential for \nexporting goods and services by providing fiscal incentives and investing \npublic  funds  in  supporting  infrastructure.  The  paper\u2019s  objectives  would \ninclude development of a fiscal blueprint for export-oriented development \npolicy.  \n \n11.  In addition, study tours will be organized to learn from foreign experience in the use of \nfiscal  instruments  for  regional  development,  particularly  for  (i)  promotion  of  (a)  industry, \nincluding  high-tech  manufacturing;  (b)  services,  including  tourism;  (c)  infrastructure;  and \n(d) renewable energy and recycling;4 and (ii) regulation of labor migration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will provide the remaining $150,000 of local currency costs in kind, to \ncover  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  related  services. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Ministry of Finance and ADB agreed for a partial delegation5 of TA implementation \nto the Department of Finance of Henan Province (DOF), which will be the executing agency (EA) \nfor the TA. An assessment of the procurement capacity of DOF by ADB confirmed that DOF has \nthe capacity to implement a delegated TA. The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS)6 will be the \nimplementing agency. Partial delegation, in this context, would include (i) overall guidance of the \nTA; (ii) selection and engagement of the national consulting entity;7 and (iii) procurement of \nequipment, national workshops, and overseas training. ADB would assume responsibility for \nselection and engagement of the international consultant, and TA oversight.8 The provincial \ngovernment  will  formulate  the  detailed  work plan  for  the  TA  and  implement  it  through  an \nextensive consultation process to have broad-based ownership, with wider inputs into the policy \nresearch studies. DOF will be assisted in the day-to-day administration of the TA by a technical \nassistance management committee.9 Overall supervision of the TA will be undertaken by DOF \n                                                 \n4  Particularly in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. \n5  To increase ownership of TA projects and improve sustainability of project benefits, ADB may, in particular \ncircumstances, delegate responsibility to a borrower (\u201cdelegated TA\u201d) to recruit and supervise TA consultants in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The level of \ndelegation would be akin to \u201clow level of EA delegation\u201d under ADB. 2008. Increasing the Impact of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Program. Manila.  \n6  IFS is a registered nonprofit institute under DOF administrative supervision. The institute was chosen as a result of \n(i) its work experience and intimate knowledge of fiscal policy issues in the province, (ii) the need to have a reliable \ninstitutional anchor for consultative processes over a long time period, and (iii) to coordinate multidisciplinary inputs \nfrom several local institutions into each of the five sector studies proposed under the TA. \n7  IFS or IFS staff could not be contracted as national consultants. \n8  Oversight may include checks on the selection and engagement of national consulting entities and expenditure \naudits. \n9  The committee will be constituted at the time of TA inception. ", "  5\nwith support from a steering committee comprising DOF representatives, the research institute \nof the government of Henan, the provincial academy of social sciences, and ADB.10  \n \n14.  An international expert on fiscal policy with a strong background in development and \nfiscal management will be engaged by ADB for 3 person-months. DOF will recruit a single \nconsulting entity to undertake the studies. DOF should apply consultant qualification selection \n(CQS)  to  recruit  the  consulting  entity.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  to  contribute  to \nworkshops and training programs. All consultants11 for the TA will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time); the procurement method is described in the procurement plan \n(Appendix 3), which also outlines the extent of ADB oversight over various delegated activities.  \n \n15.  The  TA  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For withdrawal of the TA grant funds, the EA \nwill submit to ADB the original withdrawal application signed by an authorized representative, a \nsummary sheet, and copies of supporting documents. To facilitate implementation of the TA \nactivities, following TA effectiveness DOF will establish and manage an imprest account in a \nbank acceptable to ADB. The ceiling of the imprest account will be $100,000; claims should be \nbased on detailed estimated expenditure costs. The interest earned on the TA grant in the \nimprest account can be used to cover bank charges and any other remittance fees. Upon \ncompletion of the TA grant and before closing of the imprest account, any unutilized interest \nshould be returned to ADB. If the remittance fees and other bank charges exceed the interest \nearned,  the  amount  in  excess  of  interest  earned  could  be  charged  to  the  miscellaneous \nadministration expenditures of the TA. To simplify documentation, the statement of expenditure \nwill be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account and reimbursement of \neligible costs for any individual payment not exceeding $10,000. Expenditures in excess of the \nstatement of expenditure will be reimbursed, replenished, and liquidated based on the full \nsupporting documentation. DOF is currently implementing ADB loan projects and has adequate \nfinancial management capabilities. DOF will maintain separate accounts for the TA grant; these \naccounts will be audited annually, with the audit report submitted to ADB within 3 months of the \nend of the fiscal year. DOF will retain the original supporting expenditure documents under the \nTA for 5 years after TA completion; during that period DOF will make these documents available \nto  ADB  for  review  upon  request.  A  diagrammatic  depiction  of  the  flow  of  funds  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix 1. \n \n16.  The international fiscal policy expert will assist the EA in TA implementation by providing \nan  international  perspective  on  development  issues,  advising  on  fiscal  policy  issues,  and \nreviewing studies to improve their quality. The international consultant will prepare output (ii)(e) \nand also assist in the preparation of outputs (i) and (ii)(a) in para. 10, with particular focus on \nstrengthening  the  public  financial  management  system.  Draft  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  A technical support committee comprising top research institutions will be constituted to \nprovide the necessary advisory, technical and peer review inputs for preparing all policy studies \nplanned under the TA (the TA organization chart is in Supplementary Appendix 2). Among \nothers, the technical support committee will be represented by experts drawn from (i) the \n                                                 \n10 Represented by the East Asia Department and the PRC Resident Mission. \n11 The consultants will be entitled to the privileges, exemptions (including tax exemptions), and immunities provided in \nthe Technical Assistance Framework Agreement between the Government and ADB, dated 23 December 1996. \n ", "6   \nresearch institute of the government of Henan, (ii) the research institute of the communist party \nof Henan, (iii) provincial academy of social sciences, (iv) the University of Zhengzhou, (v) the \nUniversity of Henan, (vi) the college of financial studies of Henan, (vii) the vocational school of \nthe Henan taxation bureau, and (viii) the planning agency of the Henan provincial government. \nThe national consulting entity will prepare four studies covering outputs (ii)(a)\u2013(ii)(d) and the \nstrategic study under (i) indicated in para. 10. The IFS, in addition to providing fiscal policy \ninputs  to  all  studies  as  required,  will  help  DOF  in  supervising  the  inputs  of  national  and \ninternational consultants. All the studies will be based on a survey of experience in other \nprovinces of PRC, field work in Henan Province, international experience, and will draw on \nofficial and other studies and research reports. The TA will be completed in 18 months.12 \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.

Detailed terms of reference for national \nconsultants  will  be  finalized  by  DOF  when  seeking  expressions  of  interest  from  national \nconsultants. The broad objectives of each of the five planned sector studies and the strategic \nstudy are indicated below. \n \n5.  Overview Study: Improving Sustainable Livelihoods and Promoting a Harmonious \nSociety.  The objective of this paper is to design fiscal policies to promote sustainable \nemployment and enhance equitable and sustainable access to basic social services (covering \neducation,  health,  housing,  and  social  security).  Education  sector  policies  would  include \nsupporting compulsory basic education in rural areas, providing support to poor students, and \nexpanding vocational education. Health sector policies would focus on providing basic health \ncare services in rural and urban areas, and developing an equitable and cost-effective health \ncare  system.  This  study  will  (i)  review  the  fiscal  policies  and  impediments  to  balanced \ndevelopment of agriculture, industry and services sectors in Henan; and (ii) study the fiscal \nmanagement strengths of the Henan government.  \n6.  Industrial and Infrastructure Development and Market Transformation. In addition \nto coal mining, Henan\u2019s industrial base is largely concentrated in six major industrial sectors\u2014\nfood  processing,  petrochemicals,  textiles,  nonferrous  metals,  automobiles  and  parts,  and \nmachinery\u2014  in  which  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  dominate.  These  industries  face \nchallenges  due  to  a  lack  of  innovation,  weak  competitiveness,  and  low  profitability.  The \nobjective of the study is to suggest fiscal policies that would help in attracting private capital to \nimprove the sector\u2019s efficiency and competitiveness. This includes the study of institutional \nreforms and policies needed to encourage SOE restructuring and privatization. To accomplish \nthis the consultants will  \n(i)  for each key industrial sector, conduct a diagnostic review assessing the status \nof sector development that identifies key constraints and challenges faced in \nterms of (a) institutional development, (b) the policy environment, (c) production \nefficiencies compared to the best performers in the PRC, (d) reasons for poor \nperformance, and (e) internal and external threats; and \n(ii)  based  on  (i),  formulate  fiscal  policies  for  attracting  private  investment  and \nmodern technology into the key industries;  \n                                                 \n1  The sector study on fiscal strategy for export promotion will be based on the findings of the sector studies and the \nconsultant\u2019s own study on overall fiscal policy and strengths of Henan Province\u2019s fiscal management. \n ", "   Appendix 4  13 \n(iii)  include under (ii) a plan for restructuring SOEs with a view to attracting private \ninvestment and modern technology to enhance their competitiveness;  \n(iv)  prepare policies to open up the Henan economy to external markets and the \nprivate sector with a view to promoting competition and attracting investment; \n(v)  take careful note of natural advantages, core competitiveness, and the future \npotential of Henan Province while formulating fiscal policies; and \n(vi)  suggest  policies  for  promoting  resource  conservation,  energy  efficiency  and \nreducing the adverse environmental impact of industry.   \n \n7.  Modernization of the Services Sector. The paper will design fiscal policies to promote \nmodernization of the services sector in Henan. To achieve this, the study will examine \n(i)  the current status of services in Henan and the internal structure of the sector in \nrelation  to  service  sectors  in  other  provinces  in  the  PRC,  and  the  relative \ndevelopment and competitiveness of the service sector in the 18 cities in the \nprovince;  \n(ii)  factors  that  influence  modernization  of  services,  and  how  the  sector\u2019s \ndevelopment would influence the growth process; \n(iii)  the comparative advantage of Henan Province for developing a modern services \nsector, its competitiveness (in terms of attracting investment) compared to other \nprovinces in the PRC, and impediments to service sector modernization in Henan \nProvince; \n(iv)  existing fiscal (including tax and expenditure) policies to promote modernization \nof the services sector, and assess the effectiveness of existing fiscal instruments \nto stimulate modernization; and \n(v)  based  on  (iv),  assess  key  constraints  and  set  medium-term  goals  for \nmodernization,  and  prepare  a  fiscal  strategy  focusing  on  (a)  needed  fiscal \ninvestments,  (b)  tax  incentives,  (c) the  burden  of  nontax  revenues  on  the \nservices  sector,  (d)  incentive  policies  for  local  government  for  promoting \nmodernization, and (e) other policies needed to create a good investment climate \nfor service sector modernization. \n \n8.  Preservation of Cultural Resources. The paper will \n(i)  assess the existing state of cultural resources, the status of development of \nactivities and institutions associated with cultural resources, and the problems \nthat enterprises and institutions associated with cultural resources face; \n(ii)  review the existing fiscal (both tax and expenditure) policies to promote cultural \nresources and activities; examine the implementation of recent policies and their \neffectiveness;  and  compare  the  policies  pursued  by  Henan  with  successful \npolicies pursued abroad, with a view to identifying weaknesses; \n(iii)  based on (ii), assess key constraints, and in collaboration with enterprises and \ninstitutions set medium-term goals for cultural resource development and prepare \na  fiscal  strategy  focusing  on  (a)  needed  investments,  (b)  tax  incentives, \n(c) support  for  enterprises  and  institutions  in  the  sector,  (d)  incentives  for \ntechnological  innovation,  and  (e)  other  policies  needed  for  preserving  and \ndeveloping cultural resources; and \n(iv)  assess  the  impact  of  the  development  of  cultural  resources  on  the  Henan \neconomy. \n \n9.
