Project Description The Project will assist indigenous farmers to increase crop\nproductivity through appropriate farming practices and\nsimple technologies. The Project is based on the concept\nof promoting sustainable farming systems utilizing existing\ntraditionaJ clans and organizing them into effective self-help\ngroups that create increased incomes and improved living\nconditions. The Project is located in the province of Irian\nJaya, with the development sites in the districts of Sorong,\nManokwari, Fak-Fak, Merauke and Jayawijaya. The Project\nwill cover about 129,000 ha of land and involving some\n28,000 households. Farmers in these areas are in\ntransition from shifting cultivation to sedentary/subsistence\nagriculture. Over 80 per cent of the farmers are poor and\nthe Project seeks to increase farm incomes with the\nintroduction of better food crop planting materials and\nimproved farming practices and the development of tree\ncrops that can generate a steady source of cash income.\nThe proposed loan will be the Bank's one hundred eighty\none loan to Indonesia, and the seventy sixth loan in the\nagriculture sector.\n3. Classification -\t :\t Poverty Reduction Project\n4. Rationale : Poverty in lrian Jaya is widespread and agricultural\nactivities are not sustainable in areas where population\ndensity is high. Farm productivity in many areas of Inan\nJaya has been declining because of non-sustainable\nagricultural practices and soil degradation. Indigenous\nfarmers are putting pressure on the forest and foothill areas\nin their continued search for new, productive land for\ncultivation. Thus, the indigenous agriculture production\nprocess is subjecting a sizeable area of communal land to\nenvironmental risk and destabilizing the existing\necosystem, while poor, indigenous farmers are\nprogressively forced to subsist on a declining natural\nresource base. Increasingly, indigenous farmers are\nseeking improved farming methods and cultivation\npractices to increase farm productivity and to diversify crop\nproduction.\n5. Obiectives and Scope\t The objectives of the Project are (i) to increase agricultural\nproductivity and household income, (ii) to introduce\n-\t agricultural practices that enhance and conserve local", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(iii)\nnatural resources and environment, and (iii) to put in place\na self-sustaining community-based development process\nthat enables village communities to become increasingly\nself-reliant and capable of enhancing their quality of life.\nThe main components of the Project are:\n(I) Community Development, Extension and Training:\norganization of village communities into farmer\ngroups, and provision of extension and training to\nindigenous farmers;\n(ii) Agriculture Development to (a) improve food crop\nproduction; (b) rehabilitate and expand about\n11,000 ha of existing tree crops on degraded\ncommunal lands to increase farmers' cash income\nand stabilize land use; and (c) provide household\nanimals to increase animal protein consumption by\nindigenous farm household members;\n(iii) Rural Infrastructure: rehabilitation or improvement\nof about 300 km of farm roads and provision of\nabout 300 dug wells and spring-fed village water\nsupply systems;\n(iv) Environmental Management and Farming System\nResearch: provision of support to strengthen\ninstitutions involved in environment management\nand farming system research; and\n(v) Proiect Management and Consulting Services:\nestablishment of Project Management Units (PMU)\nand provision of office facilities and consulting\nservices for Project implementation.\n6.\t Cost Estimates ($ million):\nForeign\t Local\t Total\n\t\nComponent Exchange Currency\t Cost\n1.

Loan Amount and Terms : Because the Project's main focus is on poverty reduction\nand environment conservation, it is proposed that the Bank\nprovides, from its Asian Development Fund, a loan of $28.0\nmillion to finance this Project, with an annual service\ncharge of 1 per cent. The loan will have an amortization\nperiod of 35 years, including a grace period of 10 years.\n9. Period of Loan Utilization Until 30 September 200C)\n10. Implementation\nArrangements A Project Management Office established at the provincial\ncapital will be responsible to coordinate and carry out all\nimplementation activities of the Project. At the field level,\nPMUs will implement the Community Development,\nExtension and Training, Agriculture Development,\nInfrastructure Development and the Environment\nManagement components. The Agency for Agriculture\nResearch and Development (AARD) will be responsible for\nimplementating the Farming Systems Research\nsubcomponent.\n11. Executing Agency : The Directorate General of Estates (DGE) as lead\nExecuting Agency (EA); cooperating EAs are the\nDirectorate General of Food Crops and Horticulture\n(DGFCH), Directorate General of Livestock Services\n(DGLS) and Agency for Agriculture Research and\nDevelopment (AARD).\n12. Procurement : All supplies and equipment to be financed by the Bank will\nbe procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for\nProcurement. Supply contracts estimated to cost an\nequivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the\nbasis of international competitive bidding. Supply\ncontracts of less than $500,000 will be awarded on the\nbasis of international shopping, except minor items that\ncost less than $50,000 will be procured under direct\npurchase. The procurement of crop planting materials,\nfarm tools and household animals will be carried out by\ndirect purchase.\n13. Consultant Services : The Project will provide consulting services to assist in all\nProject implementation activities. A total of 300 man-\nmonths of consulting services comprising 210 man-months", "(v)\nof domestic consutting services and 90 man-months of\ninternational consulting services will be provided under the\nProject. Recruitment of consultants will be carried out in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.\n14. Estimated Project 31 March 2000\nComDletion Date\n15. Project Benefits\nand Beneflcianes The Project will directly benefit 28,000 farm households\nscattered over 61 villages. The direct beneficiaries\nrepresent some 15 per cent of the total population of the\ntargeted Kecamatans (subdistricts). Most Project\nparticipants belong to a hard core poverty group of\npeasants living in isolated hamlets, practicing shifting\ncuftivati\u00e0n supplemented by fishing, hunting and gathering\nof forest products. Currently, their annual income per\nhousehold ranges from $260 to $490, which is below the\npoverty level of $500 per household per annum. The\nProject will increase their annual household income to\n$55041 ,400 (beneficiaries with tree crops). There will be\nsignificant increases, in farm productivity. The farmgate\nvalue of food crop produce is estimated at $14 million per\nannum. Exports of tree crop produce will generate\nadditional annual foreign exchange earnings of $8 million.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n138\u00b0O0'E\nINDONESIA\nINDONESIA\nSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nPACiFIC OCEAN\nIN IRIAN JAVA\nPROJECT\nnt\t f-\"\t /\t5____\t AREA\n-\np\nL -\t !'A C!FIC OCEA /.r\t V -\nJVA'\n-\t\nTIMUR 0Sorong\t \u2022 Manckwa-\trl\t --. \t- --\nINDIAN OCEAN S7\t SORONG\t - \u2014\t \u00b0Slak\nDISTRICT\nMANOKWARI\t \u2014 -- -\nTeminabua,i'\t DISTRICT\t -- -\t 6 -\t -\nSerui\n-. - -- -\t -\t Cnh,.nc yin\t __-\t I\n\u2014 . \u2014 \u2014\t Jayapura 0 --\n/\t -\u2022\t ----.\n---- -,0LF_ak Fal<-\t '\t -\n'\t 'i\t Nabire\n0\n-T\t -,\nA\n) t-..\t ill\t I\t -\t -,\t -1\t wamena\nI\u2014\t \u2022/ ).

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a\nproposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Sustainable Agriculture Development Project\nin man Jaya.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The Government of Indonesia accords high priority to the development of eastern\nIndonesia. In the context of the Government's development objectives for the eastern region\nwith respect to poverty reduction, employment generation, environment conservation and\nbalanced regional development, the Government of Indonesia requested Bank assistance for\nthe Sustainable Agriculture Development Project in Irian Jaya in January 1990. In response to\nthe request, the Bank approved in October 1990 a technical assistance (TA) 1' for the\npreparation of the Project. The feasibility study was completed in August 1992. A Bank Fact-\nFinding Mission was fielded in December 1992 to review the proposed Project, and held\ndiscussions with the Government and various concerned implementing agencies to resolve\nProject-related issues. This was followed by an Appraisal Mission from 1 to 20 March 1993.\nThe Appraisal Mission reached an agreement with the Government on technical, organizational,\nimplementation, financial and economic aspects of the Project, and confirmed that the\nGovernment accorded high priority to the Project. Loan negotiations with authorized\nrepresentatives of the Government were held in Manila from 22 to 24 September 1993.\nIll. BACKGROUND\nA.\t The Agriculture Sector\n1.\t General\n3. The development strategy of Indonesia as outlined in the Fifth Five-Year\nDevelopment Plan FYI 989/90-1993/94 (Repelita V), and as expected to carry over to Repelita\nVI (1994/95-1 998/99)-a' aims at sustainable economic growth, employment generation, equitable\ndistribution of income, alleviation of poverty, and conservation of natural resources and the\nenvironment. The agriculture sector is expected to contribute substantially to achieving these\nobjectives.\n4. In spite of its rapid industrialization and urbanization over the past decade,\nIndonesia is basically an agrarian country. The agriculture sector accounts for almost 20 per\ncent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and more than half of national employment.\nTwo thirds of the country's rural households and 10 per cent of the urban households depend\non agriculture for their livelihood. The predominant agriculture subsector is food crops, which\nconstitute over 60 per cent of the agricultural GDP. The sector has made a major contribution\nto economic development, employment generation and poverty reduction in Indonesia.\nAgriculture value-added grew by an average of about 4 per cent per annum during the last ten\n1'\t\nTA No. 1401 -INO: Sustainable Agriculture Development Project in Irian Jaya, for\n$600,000, approved on 26 October 1990, funded by the Japan Special Fund.\nThe Appraisal Mission was composed of Y. L. Yes (Mission Chief/Project Economist), W.\nStaub (Senior Project Specialist), M. Nagata (Senior Programs Officer), F. J. Delwiche\n(Counsel), B. T. Tan (Agriculture Economist/Staff Consultant) and M. Heppell\n(Sociologist/Staff Consultant).\nThis was expressed in the Guidelines of State Policy announced by the Government in\nMarch 1993.", "2\nyears, a rate which outpaced population growth, enabled near self-sufficiency in food production\nand increased exports by about 5 per cent per annum.\n5. Of the 42 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land in Indonesia, about half is\nunder permanent cultivation, and the rest is under shifting cultivation (25 per cent) and livestock\npasture (25 per cent). The area being intensively cultivated consists of about 7.7 million ha of\nwetland food crops (including 5.3 million ha of irrigated land), 7.6 million ha of tree crops and\n5.3 million ha of upland food crops. Except for large plantations comprising about 20 per cent\nof the tree crop area, Indonesia's agricultural production is dominated by its 18 million\nsmallh\u00e0lders, most of whom farm less than 1 ha.\n6. Over the past two decades, improved productivity and income levels in the\nagriculture sector have significantly reduced the incidence of rural poverty. According to the\nNational Socioeconomic Survey of 1990, the population living below poverty line in rural areas\ndeclined rapidly, from 44 million in 1976 to 18 million in 1990. In relative terms, the decline is\nmuch sharper, from 40.4 per cent to 14.3 per cent. Furthermore, there was a faster decline in\nthe rural areas than in urban areas where the population below the, poverty line declined from\n38.8 per cent to 16.8 per cent during the same period.\n7. Although the growth figures are impressive and the incidence of poverty in rural\nareas has been drastically reduced, most of this has occurred in the irrigated lowlands, which\nare mainly planted to rice and represent only a quarter of the land area under permanent\ncultivation. Other areas, except for some rainted land planted with tree crops, have largely been\nbypassed by the eatlier development efforts and continue to be characterized by high levels of\npoverty. Here, three quarters of households with agriculture as their main source of livelihood,\nlive below the poverty line of about $100 per capita per annum.V In the eastern region,\nespecially in lnan Jaya Province, the incidence of poverty remains high. In addition, the\nincreasing population in settled villages is exerting pressure on existing farms and the\nsurrounding marginal and sloping lands, and has resulted in resource degradation. Sizeable\nareas are at environmental risk as poor farmers are forced to subsist on a declining resource\nbase.\n2.\t Agriculture Development in lrian Java\n8. Irian Jaya, one of Indonesia's least developed provinces, has a total area of\n414,800 square kilometers and is the country's largest province. About .84 per cent of the total\narea is under forest and 12 per cent under bush and scrub vegetation. Only 4 per cent is being\nutilized for agriculture, tree crop plantations and transmigrant settlements. The population is\nabout 1.65 million, a great majority of whom (some 80 per cent) live in small rural traditional\ncommunities and depend upon traditional farming and hunting/forest food gathering systems.\nIndigenous farmers generally practice shifting cultivation within the traditional boundaries of their\nlandholdings. The landholding occupied by each family within the group is recognized by\ntraditional land law and the tribal chief. The typical cropping pattern includes sweet potatoes,\ntaro, cassava and maize with practically no fertilizer or other agrochemicals. Yields are low and\nhave been declining in recent years due to soil erosion and fertility depletion. The agriculture\nactMties are generally subsistence oriented, with farmers growing as much as the family\nrequires to eat. Poverty in Irian Jaya is a widespread rural phenomenon with over 70 per cent\nThe poverty line of Indonesia is based on estimated total expenditure required to supply\nthe recommended daily dietary allowance of 2,100 calories per capita per day plus\nexpenditure for certain nonfood basic items. A crude estimate was determined at\nequivalent to about 350 kg of rice per person per annum. This is roughly equivalent to\nabout $100 per capita income per annum at 1993 prices.", "3\nof indigenous farmers living on subsistence agriculture with little or no cash earnings. Income\nis usually supplemented by forest gathering and, recently, by the cultivation of perennial cash\ncrops such as cocoa, coffee and fruit.\n9. The farmers are organized into indigenous communities each consisting of 40 to\n50 families, generally with annual per capita incomes below the national poverty line. Most, if\nnot all the communities lack basic physical and social amenities and services, as well as\nessential agricultural inputs such as improved seeds/planting material, fertilizers, pesticides,\ncredit and other farm inputs. Poor primary and secondary farm roads has been a major\nconstraint to the intensification and diversification of agnculture and the expansion of agro-\nindustries. The Inanese have virtually been bypassed by the country's mainstream development\ninitiatives in the agriculture and rural sectors.\nB.\t Government Policies and Plans\n1.\t General\n10. In the implementation of its successive five-year development plans (Repelitas)\nsince 1969 the Government's overall economic policy has been guided by the triple goals of\ngrowth, equity and stability. As the main rural economic activity, agriculture has been expected\nto be the major contributor to the achievement of these objectives. The major components of\nthe Government's strategy in this regard have been to achieve a rapid expansion in food crop\nproduction to meet increasing domestic demand, to provide gainful employment for a rapidly\nexpanding population and to achieve more equitable regional development. The goals have\nbeen effected through large investments in physical infrastructure for irrigation, drainage and\nflood control; input subsidies; and farm support programs to encourage the adoption of new\nproduction technologies. Parallel support was also provided in the tree crop subsector through\nopening new areas to settle landless farmers under the Nucleus Estate and Smaliholder (NES)\nscheme and through rehabilitation of unproductive smallholder tree crop areas under the Project\nManagement Unit scheme As a result, the growth of the agriculture sector has been\nremarkable: agricultural output increased by an average of 4 per cent per annum during the\n1 970s and 1 980s, and self-sufficiency in rice was achieved in 1984.\n11. In view of the development challenges posed by rural poverty and the\nunsustainable farming conditions found in most nonimgated rural areas, the Government, during\nRepelita IV (1984/85-1988/89), began to move away from its early agricultural development focus\non immediate production increases to a long-term strategy to promote more sustainable growth,\nwhich emphasizes increasing productivity and conserving the underlying natural resource base.\nThrough this shift in strategy, the Government has made a concerted effort to increase the\nproduction of nonrice food crops and smallholder tree crops. In doing so, particular attention\nis being given to eastern Indonesia, which has the highest incidence of rural poverty.\n12. The Government recognizes that unsound agricultural practices undercut its\npoverty reduction efforts and is therefore placing increased emphasis on land-use patterns,\nwatershed management, sustainable farming systems, vegetative soil conservation techniques\nand location-specific research on agricultural practices that would maintain or enhance the\nnatural resource base. Coming to grips with these concerns over a widely dispersed\narchipelago has also necessitated a move toward decentralized decision-making and greater\ninvolvement of the rural community groups.\nThe Project Management Unit scheme involves the provision of credit and farm inputs\nto assist small farmers to rehabilitate/expand their existing farm areas assisted by staff\nfrom specially created Project Management Units.", "4\n13. The Government's development initiatives in the agricultural sector in Inan Jaya\nplace emphasis on the sustainable management of natural resources. The Government's\ndevelopment program also places high priority on 'people centered development,' with a\ncommunity development and participatory approach sensitive to the local culture. To work\ntowards this objective, the provincial authorities have launched several sectoral and regional\ndevelopment initiatives focused on village communities. These 'integrated' development\nprograms, which aim to accelerate village development, are currently being implemented in\nvarious subdistricts (Kecamatans) in all of the eastern provinces. The programs cover\nimprovements in agnculture, transportation, health and education. Under these programs,\nemphasis is given to increasing the strength and capacity of extension workers at the\nKecamatan level to carry out a diverse range of small-scale activities that respond directly to the\nneeds of the indigenous farmers.\nC.\t External Assistance to the Agriculture Sector\n14. An overview of external assistance to the agriculture sector of Indonesia during\nthe last decade is given in Appendix 1. The Bank, Japan and the World Bank are the major\nfunding agencies for the sector in terms of amount of assistance, while sources such as the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAQ),\nAustralia, Canada and the United States (US) have also been actively involved in the\ndevelopment of this sector. The World Bank's assistance has focused on irrigation and tree\ncrop development through the NES concept. The World Bank has also assisted transmigration\nprojects, which generally include tree or food crop production as the main component. Japan's\nassistance to the sector has concentrated on irrigation and flood control. Australia and Canada\nhave been assisting rural development or integrated agricultural development in priority regions\nparticulaily in eastern Indonesia. Recent US assistance has emphasized mainly policy reforms\nin the agriculture sector particularly in natural resources management, the rural banking system\nand agribusiness. Given the extent of external involvement in the agricultural sector, substantial\ncoordination at the policy, program and project level is required and has been achieved through\nregular consultations between the funding agencies.\n15. External initiatives in Irian Jaya have been limited. The major initiatives include\nnation-wide development schemes that include Irian Jaya, such as the World Bank's Agricultural\nTraining Ill, National Agricultural Extension Project Ill and Transmigration V; and the smaller\nFAO/IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and UNDP projects, the Income\nGenerating Project for Small Farmers (better known as PK4 in Indonesia), which seeks to\nimprove the skills of farmers and enhance off-farm income opportunities. The Bank has\nfinanced a NES project component in Irian Jaya,!' where a 4,500 ha NES oil palm plantation\nwas successfully established. The Bank has also provided two project preparatory TAs for\nfeasibility studies and two loans for fisheries projects in Irian  Jaya.a' The other large-scale\nproject that targets solely Irian Jaya is the Irian Jaya Joint Development Foundation (IJJDF)\nfunded by the Government and the United Nations. The IJJDF, established in the 1 960$, has\nbeen helping the poor peasants of Irian Jaya through direct and indirect small investments.\nUNDP has been assisting IJJDF for more than two decades in strengthening its capability as\nthe major provincial lending institution. It has so far invested in sectors such as agriculture,\nLoan No. 687-INO NES Oil Palm Project, for $44.64 million, approved on 28 August\n1984.\na' TA No. lNO-1 282: Third NES Oil Palm Development Project, for $554,000, approved on\n28 March 1990; TA No. lNO-1 401: Sustainable Agricultural Development Project in Irian\nJaya, for $600,000, approved on 26 October 1990; Loan No. 154(SF)/155-INO: Irian\nJaya Fisheries Development Project, for $7.9 million, approved on 4 December 1973;\nand Loan No. 566-INO: Second Irian Jaya Fisheries Development Project, for $34\nmillion, approved on 25 March 1982.", "5\nlivestock, shipbuilding, transportation and marketing. In addition, small-scale projects\n(averaging $4,000 each), mostly in the agriculture sector, are being funded through Canadian\nInternational Development Assistance and monitored by Yayasan Pengembangan Masyarakat\nDesa (Rural Society Development Foundation), a Jayapura-based non-government organization\n(NGO).\n16. man Jaya is also benefiting from assistance provided by various NGOs, most of\nwhich are church-based. Among the more significant examples of church-based NGOs active\nin the province are World Vision, the Summer Institute for Unguistics and Bethesda. These\norganizations operate community development training centers and carry out grassroot-level\ncommunity development activities focused on water supply, agricultural trials and sustainable\nfarming practices, health and nutrition. The World Wide Fund for Nature has provided TA since\n1 980for a variety of activities in support of improving the management of the national parks and\nwildlife reserves in Irian Jaya. The Ford Foundation has also provided assistance to the\nDepartment of Forestry for social forestry monitoring and documentation and has funded\ndevelopment of pilot projects for social forestry in the buffer zone of the Cyclops Nature Reserve\nat Sentani District. The larger NGOs have established extensive support services to remote\nareas with the use of small aircraft which, in many cases, are the area's main link to the outside\nworld.\n17. As of 30 September 1993 the Bank had provided loans totaling about $2,864\nmillion to support Indonesia's agriculture and renewable natural resources sector. This\naccounted for about 29 per cent of the Bank's total lending to Indonesia. All loans have been\nfrom the Bank's ordinary capital resources, except for loans committed before 1972. Some\nblended loans were made during the fifth replenishment(1 987-1990) of the Asian Development\nFund (ADF) and two loans under the current sixth replenishment of ADF (1991-1994) for a total\nof about $172 million. In addition, 114 TA grants totaling about $42 million, have been provided.\n18. Through its operations in the agriculture sector, the Bank seeks to support the\nGovernment's development objectives of economic growth, sustainable development, poverty\nreduction and natural resources management. The Bank has provided considerable support\nto various Government programs, particularly in irrigation and tree crop development, thus\nsupporting the dramatic decline in absolute poverty since the late 1 960s. Since 1968 such\nassistance has included 27 irrigation and rural development projects and seven TA loans\namounting to $1,338 million and the lending for industrial tree crops and agro industry\ndevelopment projects has amounted to about $487 million for 13 projects. In addition, 22 TM\ntotaling about $6.4 million have been provided to this subsector. Details of Bank-financed loans\nand TM for the integrated agriculture and tree crops subsector are summarized in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Lessons Learned\n19. Some valuable lessons have been learned from previous agricultural development\nproject&-' and from past efforts in developing rural traditional communities that are undergoing\nthe transition from a traditional/subsistence agriculture system to a sustainable cash cropping\nsystem. These include (i) adequate farmer preparation and involvement in the development of\nThese are: Loan No. 1 55-INO: Irian Jaya Fisheries Development Project, for $7.9\nmillion, approved on 4 December 1973; Loan No. 363-INO: Teluk Lada Area\nDevelopment Project-Phase II, for $3.41 million, approved on 31 October 1978; Loan No.\n475-INO: Cibaliung Irrigation Project, for $35 million, approved on 30 October 1980;\nLoan No. 499-INO: Palm Oil Processing and Smallholder Development Project, for $28\nmillion, approved on 15 December 1980; Loan No. 566-INO: Second lnan Jaya Fisheries\nDevelopment Project, for $34 million, approved on 25 March 1982; and Loan No. 581-\nINO: Irrigation Package Project, for $77 million, approved on 14 September 1982.", "6\nalternate and appropriate cropping systems, (ii) strengthening farmer organizations to facilitate\nadoption of new cropping patterns as well as to enhance efficiencies of input procurement and\nmarketing, (iii) the importance of siting the project management offices as proximately as\npossible to the farming communities, (iv) the phased introduction of development inputs taking\ninto account beneficiary absorptive capacities, and (v) flexible Project scope and implementation\narrangements.\nE.\t The Bank's Sectoral Strategy\n20. The Bank's medium-term strategy in the agriculture focuses on: (i) the\nincreasing need to enhance the management and development of the natural resource base of\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs); (ii) the equally critical need to improve the productivity\nand sustainability of conventional agriculture; and (iii) the need to catalyze a self-sustaining rural\ndevelopment process that addresses key development concerns such as rural unemployment\nand poverty, access to basic services, the socioeconomic status of women and rural-urban\nmigration. Heavy emphasis is placed on linking Bank investments in natural resources,\nagriculture and rural development assistance with a country's overall program to address\neconomic, social and environmental objectives. Beneficiary participation and the establishment\nof new partnerships between private sector processing companies and smallholder producers\nare also emphasized.\n21. The Bank's operational strategy for Indonesia supports the overall\ndevelopmental approach of Repelita V. Wrth respect to the country's economy as a whole, it\nsupports (I) promotion of non-oil/gas exports, (ii) domestic resource mobilization,\n(iii) employment generation, (iv) basic needs and human resource development, (v) increased\nprivate sector participation, and (vi) improving the efficiency of existing investments while\noptimizing resource utilization. The agriculture sector continues to be a priority sector for Bank\nassistance with its continuing role in employment generation, poverty reduction, sustainable\nnatural resource management, protection of the environment as well as promotion of non-oil/gas\nexports. The major emphasis of the Bank's medium-term assistance to Indonesia's agriculture\nsector is agriculture productivity development particularly through irrigation, poverty alleviation,\nenvironment conservation and natural resource management.\nF.\t Policy Dialogue\n22. The Bank has actively sought to assist the Government in promoting policies that\nimprove productivity, economic efficiency and sustainability in Indonesian agriculture. The major\npolicy reform measures supported by earlier Bank-financed agriculture projects, in particular the\nFood Crop Sector Program LoanP include reduction of agricultural subsidies, deregulation of\nagricultural trade, efficient operation and maintenance and cost recovery in the irrigation sector,\ntransfer of small-scale irrigation systems to farmers, and institutional reforms in agricultural\nresearch and extension. The other major policy issues, for which intensive policy dialogue has\nbeen undertaken, is the financing and cost recovery mechanisms in the tree crop seCtor.'\nThe Bank's Medium-Term Strategic Framework (1993-1996), February 1993.\nFor a complete review, see Bank's Operational Strategy for Indonesia circulated to the\nBoard on 19 January 1990.\nLoan Nos. 1014/101 5(SF), for $250 million, approved on 13 March 1990.\nUnder the following projects: Loan No. 111 8-INO: Tree Crop Smallholder Sector\nProject, for $135 million, approved on 14 November 1991; and Loan No. 11 84-INO(SF)\nUpland Farmer Development Project, for US$30 million, approved on 5 November 1992.", "7\n23. Progress in implementing the reform measures has been generally satisfactory.\nNoteworthy achievements are reductions in budgetary subsidies, particularly fertilizer and credit\nsubsidies, efficient operation and maintenance of irrigation systems, and the strengthening of\nagricultural research and extension with increased budgetary allocations for the research.\nProgress in the other areas has been relatively slow including cost recovery in the tree crop\nsector. The Bank in collaboration with the World Bank is currently actively pursuing the\nprogress on these policy reform measures through periodic dialogue with the Government.\nIV. THE PROJECT\nA.\t SocIoeconomic Status of the Prolect Area\n1.\t Project Area\n24. The Project targets 61 villages in five districts in lnan Jaya. The population of the\nfive districts is estimated to be about 380,000 in 68,000 rural households.- The Project is\nexpected to reach about 28,000 households in the more densely populated areas (see Table\n1). The areas have been selected utilizing the following criteria: (i) population densities and\npoverty levels; (ii) severe land degradation because of the shortened cropping rotation cycle in\nthe slash-and-bum practices utilized, and the expansion of agriculture into steeper slopes and\nforest lands; (iii) existing or planned road infrastructure that will allow for ease of access; and\n(iv) the absorptive capacities of local farming communities, taking into account their previous\nexposure to improved farming practices, their interest in entering the cash and market economy\nand their receptivity to new ideas.\nTable 1: Peoples Affected by Proiect\nDistrict\t No. of Households\t Indigenous Groups\nManokwan\t 5,800\t Hattam, Sougb, Wandaman\nSorong\t 2,100\t Meibrat, Tehit\nFak Fak\t 3,250\t Amungme, Komoro\nJayawijaya\t 11,850\t Dani\nMerauke\t 5,000\t Kanom, Marind, Yae\n25. The people of the Project areas live in villages of 40 to 50 families. Population\ngrowth is high, estimated at 3.5 per cent per annum. The local language predominates, though\nthe vast majority of men and most of the younger women speak Bahasa proficiently. Christianity\nis the main religion of the native Irianese and missionary churches and NGOs continue to have\na strong influence on the religion and socioeconomic development of communities.\n2.\t Employment, Incomes and Poverty\n26. Almost all rural households in the Project areas are generally subsistence farmers.\nThey practice shifting cultivation principally of sweet potatoes and other starch crops (taro,\ncassava and yams). Rice and maize are now grown increasingly though not as staples.\nVegetables are commonly grown particularly in the highlands. Fruit trees, coffee, cashew, and\ncocoa have been introduced during the last ten years by the Government and some NGOs. In\nthe lowland areas, cocoa is grown quite extensively. These crops are grown by farmers mainly\nfor the local market to enhance cash income. Traditional livestock husbandry shows marked\nvariations between Project areas and includes pigs (which are also maintained for ritual and\nstatus purposes), poultry and cattle. Protein intake varies accordingly, and peoples' diet\ngenerally remains carbohydrate based.", "8\n27. Poverty is widespread in the Project area with annual household incomes ranging\nfrom about $260 to $490. The average household comprises 5-6 people. In the highland areas,\nthere is greater diversity of household income particularly with the emergence of semi-urban\nmarkets offering good returns on fruits and vegetables. Cash surpluses are rare and this is\nacutely felt particularly by the females. When school fees cannot be afforded, it is the females\nwho are first taken out of school. Cash is needed to purchase essential household items such\nas soap, sugar, salt, cooking oil, kerosene and school uniforms and to pay medical expenses.\nThe social design survey for the Project encountered women who traveled up to 25 km a day\nto sell fruit in the local market to obtain returns of less than $2.50 per trip that were required to\npurchase basic household needs.\n28. While the province as a whole is sparsely populated, pockets of high population\ndensities exist within each indigenous ethnic group. These communities live in a permanent\narea demarcated by the traditional land boundaries and practice swidden agriculture within their\ntraditional landholdings. The communities are usually organized under the leadership of a tribal\nchief and live together in groups of families (keret). The cultivated farmland per family\ncomprises 2-4 sites of 0.1-0.4 ha each. Wrth a growing population in each localized area, the\nfarmers are under increasing pressure to increase productivity from existing lands or-encroach\ninto adjoining forest lands.\n29. The farmers are aware that their agriculture practices are outmoded and that crop\nyields are declining. They are increasingly interested in extension advice and training to\nimprove their farming methods and cultivation practices, and to increase farm productivity. In\nrecent years, surplus sweet potatoes and small quantities of cash crops (such as vegetables,\npeanuts, maize and cocoa/coffee) are being produced by some farmers and sold in local\nmarkets to earn cash income. Part of the cash earned is used to purchase improved seed,\nplanting materials and even fertilizers to improve yields. Such progressive improvement in the\nlocal agriculture system is especially prevalent in villages located near the town centers.\nHowever, the absence of active agriculture rural development programs and the lack of\nsubstantial cash income constrains most farmers from improving production through the use\nof purchased inputs. Most farmers continue to have little or no access to credit and are faced\nwith other constraints, such as inadequate transport infrastructure. According to rapid social\nappraisals done at selected Project sites during Project preparation stage, the indigenous\nfarmers are receptive to improved agricultural technologies and probably have the capacity and\npotential to significantly improve farm productivity with appropriate assistance)-'\n30. Health problems are extensive and sometimes severe. Malaria, bronchitis and\ndiarrhea are the most common diseases. Related causes are diet, hygiene, access to clean\ndrinking water, and large families leaving mothers inadequate time for effective child rearing.\nIt is important for males in the local society to have many children. Yet every additional child\npresents an additional burden to the family budget and to the mother in terms of her work\nrequirements, health and time available to look after the children. Thus, services such as health,\nhygiene, family planning and related community education appear to be a major need.\n3.\t Environment Degradation\n31. The swidden fields cultivated by the Irianese are worked for 1-3 years depending\non land availability, and fallow periods have been 3-5 years. The bush/fallow cycle has been\ncontracting, mainly because of population pressure in the densely populated areas of the\nprovince. There is an obvious need for food crop intensification systems to maintain the fertility\nof the land. Land degradation also has implications on current poverty levels. While\nsubsistence needs are generally being met, they are coming under increasing pressure because\nThis is demonstrated by the ongoing Highland Vegetable Production Project funded by\nlrian Jaya Joint Development Foundation and assisted by German Technical Assistance\nwhere farmers are provided with simple farming tools, hybrid seeds, packing materials,\nand extension/management to market their produce to the Free Port by air.", "of lower yields, and something needs to be done urgently or subsistence needs will not be met\nand poverty levels will fall even further in the near future.\n32. Some communities are also beginning to open farm land on the steeper uplands\nand to encroach on neighboring forests. This is resutting in substantial soil degradation in the\nuplands and damage to the forest ecosystem. Such expansion of farm land is inevitable as the\npopulation grows. There is urgent need to introduce more sustainable farming practices which,\nwhile protecting the land and forest, will offer adequate returns to the farmers.\n4.\t Need. Opportunities and Constraints for Development\n33. Given the rudimentary state of development of village organizations in Irian Jaya\nand the subsistence level of village economies, the need for development assistance is very\nhigh. Community development is, at best, rudimentary and the development of local institutions\nhas been largely neglected. Rather than experiencing economic improvements, most\ncommunities are enduring the reverse as pressures on land reduce the bush/fallow cycle and,\nconsequently the land's productivity. Incomes are probably declining at the same time that\nsubsistence is declining because of reduced productivity; thus there are greater requirements\nfor cash to supplement the reduced subsistence. Communities are therefore in an economic\nsqueeze of declining incomes and increasing cash needs. The Project provides an opportunity\nfor communities to manage their way out of the problem.\n34. All communities encountered during the social design preparation for the Project\nhave demonstrated their ability to change their economic practices, introduce new crops and\nlivestock, and change their traditional patterns of agriculture if assistance and access to\nmarketing is available. They have clearly demonstrated a demand for a broader range of crops.\nA semi-government organization, LJJDF (para 15), has been operating in Irian Jaya for over\ntwenty years and has organized several smallholder plantations of coffee arabica, cocoa, rubber\nand cashew trees and of vegetables. It organizes the provision of planting materials, farmer\ntraining, the provision of small loans (in the form of minor equipment such as spades and\nknives) to the farmers and marketing. A Catholic Mission in the highlands has similarly assisted\nIrianese smallholders to undertake coffee plantations, and a commercial organization, PT Prima,\nhas recently established a 100 ha coffee plantation in collaboration with local Irianese.\n35. The agricultural potential by Project area as assessed by the feasibility study and\ndemonstrated by the farmers is as follows: (i) in Manokwan, farmers are cultivating potatoes,\ntaro and maize and have recently expanded into cocoa, fruit trees and upland rice; (ii) in\nSorong, staple crops are sweet potato and cassava, and farmers have begun planting\ngroundnut; (iii) in Fak Fak, farmers have traditionally grown sweet potato, and in recent years.\nvegetables (brasicca, spinach and pepper chili), groundnut, fruits (jackfruit and papaya) and\ncocoa have been cultivated; (iv) in Jayawijaya, farmers are trying to move from sweet potatoes\nto vegetables, tobacco, maize, pulses and coffee; and (v) Merauke is particularly suited for\ncashew plantations, which have been initiated.\n36. Notwithstanding the above potential, the Project has to take account of other\nimportant constraints. The Inanese way of life is built around subsistence swidden agriculture,\nthough recently, this has been limited to areas within access of the village, thus allowing the\nvillage to become a stable and permanent settlement. Being subsistence farmers, their energies\nare directed at subsistence before they can consider cash or tree crop intensification. Thus, the\nfirst priority of the Project should be to establish secure subsistence for each village, through\nimproved crop cultivation. The existing and old tree crop areas should be rehabilitated and\nexpand to economical size and should not conflict with the demands of subsistence farming.\nThe tree crop cultivation cycle should accordingly be timed to coincide with slack periods in the\nsubsistence farming calendar (which includes ritual activities related to tribal tradition).\n37. Secure land titles are probably not essential for success of the Project. Local\nIrianese appear legally unsophisticated, have little notion of individual, alienable ownership rights\nbased on land certification principles, and prefer to adhere to the traditional rights (adat) system.\nLand is owned in common by the community, though its temporary usage rights can be", "10\nassigned to an individual by the community leadership and consensus. It will be important for\nthe Project and particularly for local government officials to take account of the traditional land\nright system.\n38. The issue of credit is complex. Some local Irianese smaliholders may not fully\nunderstand the concept of credit, particularly the obligations and risks involved. Nevertheless,\nNGOs and IJJDF have introduced credit to the smaliholders, particularly for vegetable and tree\ncrop development. These organizations also provide for the marketing of produce; thus they\nhave been able to manage the credit arrangement effectively by deducting debt-service\npayments at source from the cash sale.\n39. The situation of women also needs to be carefully considered. Traditionally, men\nin the Irianese culture devoted substantial time to war and rituals, and relatively less to farming\nand domestic duties. Women provided subsistence and nurtured the family. Men undertook\nheavy manual tasks, such as land clearing, felling and making and maintaining fences. The\nwomen managed cultivation and marketing. Thus, the woman's working day was and continues\nto be longer than the mans and averages 200 days a year on the farm compared to the man's\naverage of 125 days a year. With changing circumstances, the older men particularly are finding\nit difficult to adjust to a value system in which war and rituals have a decreasing role. They\nneed to be encouraged, however, to share the economic and work day burden with women\nmore equitably. The Project will have to ensure that the introduction of more intensified farming\ndoes not exacerbate the workload problems already being coped with by the women.\n40. Finally, the issue of markets is both an opportunity and a constraint. The Project\nhas been careful to choose sites that either have, or are planned to have in the near term, easy\naccess to urban or semi-urban market centers. NGOs, semi-government organizations and\nprivate companies have been responsible for setting in motion local marketing arrangements\nwith varying degrees of efficiencies. However, the Project will have to take account of market\nopportunities and arrangements before embarking on the promotion of specific crops in specific\nProject areas.\nB.\t Rationale\n41. The traditional ethnic groups in Inan Jaya normally live in cluster of settlements\nwithin the boundary of their traditional land and practice subsistence agriculture for their\nlivelihood. The Project area consists of pockets of indigenous farm lands where (I) the\npopulation density is relatively high, (ii) the farming rotation cycle is too short to be sustainable,\n(iii) the crop yields are low and have been declining, and (iv) in some areas the farming activities\nare beginning to encroach into marginal and forest land, resulting in resource degradation.\nConsequently, the indigenous agricultural production system is unable to provide for the\nsubsistence needs of the local population and is a threat to sustainable agricultural\ndevelopment. The indigenous farmers are becoming more aware of their need to seek\nimproved farming methods and cultivation practices to increase farm productivity and to diversify\ncrop production.\n42. Accordingly, there is a need for a project that addresses, in an integrated manner,\nthe needs of the indigenous farmers, and protects the environment through more effective\nresource management. As indicated in paragraph 8, poverty in Irian Jaya is widespread and\nagricultural activities are not sustainable in areas where population density is high. Marginal\nland is being utilized in successive rotation to feed the increasing population. There is an urgent\nneed to improve existing farming methods to bring about sustainable agricultural production\npractices that will lead to increased productivity, reduced poverty and conservation of the\nenvironment.\nC.\t Obiectives\n43. The long-term goals of the Project are to reduce poverty, enhance the\nsocioeconomic status of the indigenous lrianese and stabilize the environment. The objectives\nof the Project are (i) to increase agricultural productivity and household income; (ii) to introduce", "\u202211\nagricultural practices that enhance and conserve local natural resources and the environment;\nand (iii) to put in place a self-sustaining community-based development process that enables\nvillage communities to become increasingly self-reliant and capable of enhancing their quality\nof life. This is to be achieved by assisting the indigenous Inanese to improve existing farming\npractices and increase production of a range of crops, adoption of agroecological measures\nsuch as soil and water conservation using cover crops, improvement of rural infrastructure and\ninstitutional strengthening of Government rural development agencies and local farmer groups.\nD.\t Scope\n1.\t Prolect Design\n44. This Project will need to catalyze the active participation of village communities\nand the support and involvement of village leadership, and to forge trust and collaborative\nrelationships between the Executing Agency (EA), cooperating NGOs and the village\ncommunities. The Project will need to take careful account of the local sociocultural context of\nthe lnanese. The Project design and scope will have to be flexible to adapt to varying\nresponses from different communities, and the Project's primary design must put in place a\nsustainable development process that is owned and supported by the community.\n45. Thus, implementation will involve a mix of a designed approach and a uprocessu\norientation. From a design point of view, specific village communities have already been\nselected based on agreed objective criteria; rural infrastructure, specifically access and farm-to-\nmarket roads, to be constructed under the Project have been identified based on detailed\nengineering surveys; and the Project management structure, led by the Directorate General of\nEstates (DGE) and using the project management unit (PMU) approach has been agreed upon\non the basis of successful experiences with traditional area development projects and in the\nabsence of any viable alternative.\n46. Substantial aspects of the Project will however adopt the  uprocessu approach to\nensure the active involvement of local communities. Community organizing will be the initial and\ncontinuing basis of the Project. Village communities will be encouraged to take stock of their\npresent socioeconomic status, their needs, constraints and opportunities, and to develop simple\ncommunity action plans (CAPs) to enhance their incomes, adopt more productive and\nsustainable agricultural systems, and enhance their quality of life.\n47. Local NGOs, particulaily the missionary organizations, are greatly respected by\nthe lrianese. The Project will establish a close collaborative relationship with the NGOs and\nseek to apply successful community development approaches based on their experience. The\nintroduction of Project services will be phased and contingent on the capacities demonstrated\nby each community. Project services will be adjusted to be responsive to the priorities of each\nvillage community.\n2.\t Project Scope and Description\n48. The Project will comprise five components or sets of activities directed at\nachieving the objectives.\n(a)\t Community Development. Extension and Training\n49. The first and probably most significant output that the Project will focus upon is\norganizing village communities to assist them to take stock of their current socioeconomic and\nagricultural status, and develop simple CAPs that target the specific needs, constraints and\nopportunities of the community. This output, namely organized farming communities and their\nrespective CAPs, is considered the essential starting point of this Project. It will provide the\nbasis for a community-led Project, so that other Project services will be provided and utilized\nbased upon the absorptive capacities of each community.", "12\n50. The Project will initiate the organizing of 10-15 village communities each year.\nThe process of organizing each community will take at least six months. During this period, the\nProject's community organizer will focus on working with the local village leadership to help\norganize farmer groups, and assist them to develop their CAPs. Each CAP will focus upon\nimproving existing farming systems and how the improvements could be achieved and\nsustained during the Project period. The Project will assign in each village at least three field\nextension and community development workers, or PPL (an abbreviation of the Indonesian\nnomenclature). The PPLs will be given intensive training during Project start-up with the\nassistance of Project consultants and local NGOs. The PPL staffing will gradually increase as\nthe community moves into the implementation. of its CAP and local agricultural development.\n51. The Project will seek to integrate community development, extension and training\nservices in support of each community. The Project will utilize as a model, the successful\napproaches adopted by local NGOs. Since the NGOs will be unable to provide the PPLs, a\ncollaborative arrangement is envisaged wherein specific NGOs in each Project area will act as\nadvisers to the Project's community development processes, if necessary on a reimbursement-\nfor-services basis.\n52. The Project will establish four rural extension centers in the Project area. The\ncenter will provide a variety of technical training services to farmer groups in the Project area\nbased on specific needs. The services will include demonstration plots, on-the-job training and\nfarmer visits for exchanges of information and experience. The extension services and training\nwill take specific account of the discrete roles played by men and women in local farming, and\nwill tailor their training programs to the needs of each group.\n53. Provision of basic training to the PPLs and indigenous farmers on community\ndevelopment and appropriate farming practices from the beginning of the Project is vital for\nsuccessful implementation. Four new training centers will be established (attached to the rural\nextension centers), one each at Wamena, Ransiki, Timika and Teminabuan. In Merauke, the\nexisting training center will be utilized for this purpose. The training centers will be used for\nfarmer training and on-the-job training for Project staff. PPLs and farmers will be trained in\ncommunity and group organization, cooperative approach and management, food and tree crop\nproduction, marketing and processing, agribusiness, nutrition and gender issues. Project\ntechnical staff will be trained in food and tree crop production techniques, extension methods,\nProject planning and management, environment management and monitoring. Comprehensive\ntraining will also be provided to PPLs in various aspects of Project implementation covering\nadministration, extension techniques, and technical matters relating to agricultural production\nunder different environments. In addition, a series of training programs and farmers visits will\nbe organized to mobilize, prepare and motivate Project farmers for full and effective\nparticipation. The Project is designed to ensure that women will have access to all project\ninputs and training. PMU staff and, especially, PPLs will receive special training in gender\nawareness and in the delivery of community development and extension services to women.\nA total of about 1,975 man-months of training will be provided to the beneficiary farmers and\nProject staff during the Project period.\n(b)\t Agriculture Development\n54. Agriculture development activities will be introduced to each of the 61 farming\ncommunities based upon need and absorptive capacities. During the preparation of CAPs, each\ncommunity will be assisted in assessing its local agro-ecological practices, the production and\nproductivity of existing cropping systems, its need for and willingness to move into intensifying\nproduction and entering the market economy, how this would be feasible and what impacts the\nchange will have on their current way of life and the work sharing arrangements between the\nmales and females. Each community will thus design a food and cash crop development\nprogram with the assistance of its PPL, for submission to the Project area PMU.\n55. The PMU will assist each farming community in the implementation of its food and\ncash crop development program by providing a variety of inputs. The inputs will include training\n(under the first component), demonstration plots, improved seeds and planting materials, fruit", "13\ntree seedlings, farm tools and extension advice. The focus for food crops is expected to be on\nsweet potato, ground nut, soya bean, mung bean and maize. Since the Project will introduce\nhigher yielding varieties, it is expected that surplus production will be marketed.\n56. The Project will support the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing tree crops\ncovering 11,000 ha, comprising 3,000 ha of cocoa, 3,000 ha of coffee and 5,000 ha of cashew.\nCoconut seedlings will be provided to participating farmers for planting at their home gardens.\nFarmers will be trained in sustainable and more productive farming practices. Soil conservation\nmeasures invoMng tree legume strips and farming systems (alley cropping) to minimize soil\nerosion will be promoted particularly in about 2,500 ha of farmland in the Project areas currently\nclassified as critical. To supplement animal protein consumption by indigenous farmers, the\nProject will distribute a modest number of poultry (package of ten chicks) and pigs to\nparticipating farmers or farmer groups and will strengthen animal disease control in the Project\nsites by supplementing the existing Government program of smallholder household livestock\ndevelopment.\n57. The bulk of food and horticultural crops (particularly sweet potatoes) and animal\nproducts produced by beneficiary farmers will be consumed by the farmers' family members.\nExcess produce, such as peanUt, maize, soya bean and chicken/pigs, will be sold at local\nmarkets where the present demand for such farm produce (especially protein food) is extremely\nhigh. For example, meat (chicken and pork) and soya bean or peanut are 3-4 times the price\nin Jakarta. The existing marketing arrangements for smallholder tree crop produce is well\ndeveloped where private traders and existing nucleus estates are providing adequate services\nfor processing and marketing of the farmers' produce.\n(c)\t Rural Infrastructure\n58. To support the smallholder agriculture development program, access roads and\nfarm-to-market roads will be improved to facilitate access and marketing. Based on a detailed\nengineering survey and an assessment of the basic needs of each indigenous community in the\nselected Project sites, the Project will provide support to improve or rehabilitate about 300 km\nof rural farm roads and tracks and related structures such as bridges and culverts to improve\naccess to isolated village locations in the Project sites. The Project will also provide 220 dug\nwells and 80 spring fed village water supply systems. Priority would be given to selecting\nvillages that have serious problems in obtaining drinking water within walking distances. It is\nthe Project's preference that the identification of water supply needs, the siting of wells, and\nagreements on community contributions of labor and materials for water supply development\nbe done as part of CAPs for each community. Similarly, major operation and maintenance\nresponsibilities of the water supply systems will be undertaken by the concerned community.\n(d)\t Environment Management and Farming Systems Research\n59. The Project will provide support to the Environment Study Center (PSL) at the\nCenderawasih University in Manokwari by upgrading the main PSL facility and existing field\nstations at Ransiki and Waghete. These institutions will carry out effective environment planning,\nmanagement and monitoring activities in the province as well as undertake studies and training\nfor agriculture extension officers of the province and Project farmers in support of promoting\nsustainable agriculture development and environment conservation throughout lrian Jaya.\n60. The Project will provide support to the Agency for Agricultural Research and\nDevelopment (AARD) by establishing Farming Systems Research Center in Jayapura and two\nexperimental farms at Jayawijaya and Sorong districts. The Project will provide operational\nsupport for a series of farming system research activities appropriate to various agro-ecologicai\nzones of Irian Jaya. Based on the results of the applied farming systems research, 1AARD will\ndevelop extension materials for publication and distribution to rural communities and extension\nagencies.", "\t\n14\n(a)\t Prolect Management and Consultlna Services\n61. To support the implementation of the components, a Project Management Office\n(PMO) will be established at Jayapura and will be responsible for coordinating the activities of\nvarious district government agencies involved in the execution of Project, and for the overall\nimplementation of the Project activities. The PMO will be headed by a Project Manager who is\nexperienced at implementing rural development projects. The Project Manager will be assisted\nby a multidisciplinary team of consultants to be funded under the Project. To resolve any\nimplementation issues, the Project Manager will also be assisted by the Governor's office\nthrough representatives from the Provincial Development Planning Agency (BAPPEDA), the\nProvincial Agriculture Planning Office (KANWIL) and heads of the agriculture offices concerned\n(Estate Crops, Food Crops and Uvestock). PMUs will be established to coordinate and execute\nfield activities at the Kabupaten level. Communication and office equipment, horses, vehicles\nand motorcycles will be provided to Project field staff. The Project consultants and technical\nstaff will supervise the development of tree crop areas and the on-farm trials and demonstration\nplots in collaboration with the agriculture extension (Dinas Pertanian) field staff.\n62. The Project will provide consulting services to assist in all implementation\nactivities. The services of international and domestic consultants will be recruited from a firm\nor an association of firms to provide technical advice to the Project staff. International\nconsulting services totaling about 90 man-months will be provided in community development,\nfarming system development, extension methods and training, tree crop pest and disease\ncontrol, and environment management. Domestic consulting services totaling about 210 man-\nmonths will be provided in training, social anthropology, food crop agronomy, environment\nmonitoring and community development. They will also supervise field trials, establish\ndemonstration plots and conduct environmental monitoring activities, and assist PMO in Project\nimplementation.\nE.\t Cost Estimates\n63. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $47.03 million equivalent including\ntaxes and duties. The foreign exchange component is $16.52 million (about 35 per cent of the\ntotal Project cost), including price and physical contingencies of $2.66 million and service\ncharge during construction of $0.84 million equivalent. The local currency component is $30.51\nmillion (about 65 per cent of the total Project cost). The Project cost estimates are based on\n1993 prices (see Table 2).

The main focus of the Project is to reduce the incidence of poverty and contribute\ntowards equitably distributing the fruits of economic development to the poor people of outer\nislands. At the same time, the Project wiD contribute towards environment conservation through\nalleviating the need to encroach on marginal and sloping forest lands for agricultural production\nwhere population denstty is relatively high. Thus, in view of the Project's central focus on\npoverty reduction and environment conservation, a Bank loan from ADF amounting to $28.00\nmillion is proposed for the Project. The remaining $19.03 million (including taxes and duties)\nwill be provided by the Government through budgetary allocations. The financing plan of the\nProject is shown in Table 3.\n65. The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will have an\namortization period of 35 years, including a grace period of 10 years, and will be subject to a\n1 per cent service charge per annum.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign\t Local\t Total\t Financing\n______________\t Exchange\t Cost\t Financing\t Percentage\nBank\t 16.52\t 11.48\t 28.00\t 60\nGovernment\t -\t 19.03\t 19.03\t 40\nTotal\t 16.52\t 30.51\t 47.03\t 100\nG.\t Implementation Arrangements\n1.\t Implementation Strategies\n66. Given the cultural and socioeconomic context of the targeted beneficiaries, and\ntaking account of experience from previous integrated area development projects, the Project\nhas been designed around the following principles: (I) The targets described for each\ncomponent are flexible and will be adapted to the absorptive capacities of each community.\n(ii) Community participation and community decisions on the socioeconomic development and\nthe adoption of recommended farming systems will be the basis for implementation. (iii) Thus,\ninitial Project contact with each community will always focus on social preparation and\ncommunity organization in preparation for community-led CAPs. (iv) Local NGOs and\ndevelopment organizations have a wealth of experience in working with local communities, but,\nbecause they are relatively small and have ongoing programs, they cannot assume Project\nmanagement responsibilities. Consequently, the Project Manager will arrange collaborative\nagreements with these organizations to ensure their experience and advice are available to the\nProject.\n2.\t Organization and Management\n67. The organization and management method adopted by the Project is based on\nthe existing PMU model which has been successfully used by the DGE in various projects in\nIndonesia.\n68. The Project seeks to establish its services as near as possible to the targeted\nbeneficiaries. For this reason, all Project offices and personnel are to be located in Irian Jaya\nProvince. A PMO will be set up in the provincial capital, Jayapura, within three months of loan\neffectiveness. PMO will consist of experienced staff from DGE, the lead Executing Agency (EA),\nsupplemented by experienced technical staff from the Directorate General of Food Crops and\nHorticulture (DGFCH), Directorate General of Uvestock Services (DGLS) and AARD so that it will\nact as a single entity responsible for all the implementation activities. This will overcome the\nbureaucratic and procedural problems experienced with previous projects which involved many", "16\nEAs. The PMO will be managed by a Project Manager who will be appointed by DGE within\nthree months of loan effectiveness and will be responsible to manage and carry out all the\nProject actMties. The PMO will be assisted by the existing Provincial Coordinating Committee\nheaded by the Governor. The team of consultants to be provided under the Management and\nConsulting Services component will be based at the PMO and will assist and advise the Project\nManager.\n69. PMUs will be established in every Project district. Each PMU will be managed\nby a PMU Head: The PMU Heads will be fully accountable for all Project activities in their area.\nThe PMU will be responsible for fielding the PPLs to the Project sites, supporting and\nsupervising their activities, and coordinating the review of and Project support for the CAPs of\neach community. The PMU will also establish linkages with the local NGOs to assist in\ncommunity organization and with the private traders and existing private tree crop estates (e.g.,\nthe cocoa estate owned by the Commonwealth Development Corporation and the $JJDF in\nRansiki, and PT Prima in Baliem Valley) to provide processing and marketing outlets for\nsmallholder produce. The PMLJs will be assisted by the existing District Coordinating Committee\nin all matters relating to Project implementation. The conduct of Project activities at field level\nwill be advised and assisted by Project consultants (particularly the training and community\ndevelopment advisors), local NGOs, private- traders and local private estates. Local NGOs,\nparticularly those from the on-site missionaries, are very familiar with local traditions and are\nexperienced with local rural development involving indigenous farmers.\n70. DGE will have overall responsibility for Project implementation, coordination and\nsupervision as well as for implementing the tree crops, institutional strengthening and rural\ninfrastructure program. DGFCH, DGLS and AARD will be cooperating EAs and will be\nresponsible for implementing their respective programs: DGFCH for the food crop program,\nDGLS for the household animals program and AARD for farming system research program.\n71. To coordinate annual local budget allocations from the EAs and act as a focal\npoint for all Project matters at the national level, DGE will appoint, within three months of loan\neffectiveness, a Project Uaison Officer in DGE head office who will be directly responsible for\ncoordinating with the Bank and among the EAs.\n3.\t Implementation Schedule\n72. The implementation schedule takes into account the proposed Project design,\nits emphasis on a process learning approach, the complexity of ethnic groups and their cultural\npractices, and the need to appropriately phase coverage of the five Project districts. The Project\nwill be implemented during six years in three phases (see Appendix 3).\n(a)\t Phase 1\n73. Phase 1, a preparatory phase, will last approximately two years. It will focus on\nestablishing the PMO, recruiting staff and consultants, training staff, establishing monitoring and\nother management systems, identifying Project beneficiaries, conducting socioeconomic and\nland surveys, organizing community and developing cooperatives and groups, including the\ninitial training of key community leaders.\n74. Within three months of loan effectiveness, experienced Project staff will be\nrecruited by PMO at Jayapura and PMUs at the Project sites. DGE will commence recruiting\nthe consultants soon after loan negotiations to enable the fielding of consultants by loan\neffectiveness. During the first year, the Project activities will concentrate on organizing\ncommunities and farmer groups, developing training programs and providing strategic and\nselective training to extension staff and key farmer leaders.\n75. Implementation will proceed on a village-by-village basis. Preparatory activities\nsuch as selection of beneficiaries, community and farmer group organization and training will\ncommence after Project staff are fully trained. This will be followed by the organization of local\ncommunities assisted by Project staff and consultants in the concerned villages. In conjunction", "17\nwith the initial organization of the community, the Project will commence modest provision of\nhome garden fruit seedlings and farm tools, conduct selective on-farm trials and initiate the\nimprovement and construction of rural roads and dug wells. The emphasis during the first year\nis to ensure smooth Project implementation in subsequent years by preparing a strong\nfoundation for the Project, both in terms of staff development and indigenous farmers'\nawareness.\n(b)\t Phase 2\n76. Full implementation will commence in Phase 2 towards the middle of the second\nyear and will continue into the fifth year in three locations: Jayawijaya, Manokwan and Merauke.\nThe communities at each of these sites will have prepared their initial CAPs by the time this\nphase starts.\n(c)\t Phase 3\n77. Phase 3 will commence with implementation of Project activities in Sorong and\nFak-Fak. The communities, assisted by Project staff and consultants, will develop their own\naction plans towards the end of the second year and full implementation of the CAPs will\ncommence from middle of the third year to the end of the Project construction period, in the\nsixth year. Thus, on-farm activities of Phases 2 and 3 will overlap.\n4.\t Mid-term Review\n78. A comprehensive mid-term review will be undertaken jointly by the Bank and the\nEAs during the third year of Project implementation. The mid-term review will reassess Project\nstrategies in light of additional socioeconomic information, review progress and address\nproblems encountered in implementation with a view to overcoming deficiencies in Project\ndesign and incorporating lessons learned in further implementation. The mid-term review will\nevaluate, among other issues, changes in.the social conditions of Project beneficiaries and their\nviews on Project activities, the appropriateness of Project design and scope, effectiveness of the\nPMU approach, physical progress and adequacy of local funding, status of credit and cost\nrecovery arrangements, and adequacy and performance of Project staff and consultants. As\nthe Project is adopting a sequential implementation approach, the mid-term review will further\nstrengthen and supplement the annual review process by the PMO.\n5.\t Credit Arrangements\n79. The proceeds of the loan for tree crop establishment under the Agriculture\nDevelopment Component will be made available to farmers and farmer groups through\nbudgetary provisions along the line adopted by the Bank-financed Upland Farmer Development\nProject)-' Costs related to on-farm development during the first year of tree crop establishment\nwill be provided on non-credit basis in line with the Government's welfare and poverty reduction\npolicies. Costs related to agro-inputs, i.e., agro-chemicals, and maintenance costs from the\nsecond year onward will be made available to farmers and farmer groups on a credit basis to\nbe channeled through PMUs. This credit will be provided at a variable market-related interest\nrate, which will be reviewed annually, plus, for farmer groups, provision for credit collection cost.\nHowever, in order to limit the debt-service of the farmers to affordable levels, the interest rate\nwill be subject to a 21 per cent ceiling (excluding collection cost). The collection cost payable\nfrom the farmers to farmer groups will be set at least 2.5 per cent of the annual repayments due\nduring the repayment period. Credit will have a maximum maturity period of 15 years including\na grace period of 5 years. Participating farmers will be offered the option of prepaying their\ncredit. Each PMU (on behalf of the Government) will finalize a credit agreement with each\nparticpating farmer, within twelve months of joining the Project, specifying the terms and\nconditions of the loan.\nLoan No. 1184-INO(SF): Upland Farmer Development Project, for $30.0 million,\napproved on 5 November 1992.", "18\n6.\t Procurement of Goods and Services\n(a)\t Equipment. Materials and Supplies\n80. All supplies and equipment to be financed by the Bank will be procured in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts estimated to cost an\nequivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.\nSupply contracts of less than $500,000 (except for minor items that cost less than $50,000 to\nbe procured under direct purchase) will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. The\nprocurement of crop planting materials, farm tools and household animals will be by direct\npurchase.\n81. The Project sites are remote and an experienced private estate is near each site\nin Jayawijaya (for coffee development) and Manokwan (for cocoa development). Therefore, the\nsupply of planting materials and land development of tree crop smallholdings in these two\ndistricts would be best carried out by appointing the existing private estate in each area to\naccomplish these functions.\n(b)\t Civil works\n82. Because the civil works are simple, scattered over a large area and involve a\nnumber of small contracts during six years, foreign contractors are not likely to be interested.\nSince competent local -contractors are capable of carrying out these works efficiently and at\nreasonable cost, civil works will be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding in\naccordance with Government standard procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank.\nHowever, to promote self-help in the remote areas, the construction and rehabilitation of farm\naccess roads and water supply schemes will be carried out either through a self-help system\nlnvoMng the farmer groups organized by the concerned PMU or by contracting out the works\nto local private contractors. The participating beneficiary farmers will be trained in operation and\nmaintenance activities.\n(c)\t Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n83. Advance action is envisaged in connection with procurement and agricultural\ndevelopment measures, including (i) the procurement of essential items necessary for\nestablishment of PMO and PMUs and preparation of Project activities; and (ii) baseline arid soil\nsurveys, and farmers organization and training. Retroactive financing will be limited to  an\namount not exceeding $1,000,000 and to expenditures incurred between Project appraisal by\nthe Bank and the effective date of the Loan. All advance procurement and consultant\nrecruitment action will have to be taken in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for\nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, respectively.\n7.\t Training and Consulting Services\n84. A total of 1,975 man-months of training will be provided for participating farmers\nand Project technical and extension staff of DGE, DGFCH and DGLS in all areas relating to\nextension techniques appropriate to Irian Jaya, agriculture production and tree crop harvesting\nand processing. Key leaders of smallholder groups will be selected by the PMUs for training\nin farming systems and crop production, harvesting and processing, agnbusiness, nutrition and\ngender issues. Farmer cross-visits will be provided to about 5,000 farmers. Study tours to more\nadvanced provinces (part of the cross-visits program) will be organized for village chiefs and key\nfarmers to educate the men on gender issues and on crop production and marketing. About\n375 months of training activities will be provided specifically to the women farmers under a\nwomen-in-development program. The training program will be designed and prepared by the\ntraining consultants and specific lecturers/specialists will be engaged from the private sector,\nuniversities, NGOs and local developmental groups and other agencies to assist in the conduct\nof the training.", "19\n85. A total of 300 man-months (90 international and 210 domestic) of consulting\nservices will be required for Project implementation. The consultancy services will be provided\nby a firm. Consultants will be selected and engaged by DGE in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference for the consultants are presented\nin Appendix 4.\n8.\t Disbursement Procedures\n86. The proposed Bank loan of $28.0 million will be disbursed to finance the foreign\nexchange cost of the Project, amounting to $16.52 million. The remaining $11.48 million,\nequivalent to 38 per cent of the local currency cost, will meet part of the local expenditures for\nagricultural input, civil works, equipment and materials, training and support services (excluding\ntaxes and duties).\n87. The Bank's Statement of Expenditures (SOE) Procedures may be used for the\nliquidation of expenditures valued below $150,000 equivalent per item of expenditure (excluding\nconsulting services). The expenditures reimbursed under the SOE Procedures will be audited\nand the opinions relating thereto will be included separately in the auditor's reports.\n88. A special account will be established to facilitate Project implementation at loan\neffectiveness. The special account will be used by Bank Indonesia to receive US dollar-\ndenominated deposits from the Bank and will be established in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on Imprest Fund Procedures.\n9.\t Accounts and Auditing\n89. The Government has assured that the EAs will maintain records and accounts\nadequate to identity goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and to\ndisclose the use thereof in the Project following sound accounting principles. The DGE will (i)\nconsolidate and maintain separate accounts for the Project; (ii) have accounts and related\nfinancial statements audited annually, in accordance with sound auditing principles by auditors\nacceptable to the Bank; (iii) furnish to the Bank not later than six months after the close of each\nfIscal year unaudited copies of accounts and financial statements; and (iv) furnish to the Bank\nnot later than nine months after the close of each fiscal year certified copies of audited accounts\nand financial statements and the report of the auditor relating thereto.\n10.\t Reporting\n90. The Government will submit six-monthly progress reports to the Bank in such\nform and detail as the Bank may reasonably request including information on the physical\nprogress of works and the operations relevant to Project implementation. Within three months\nof physical completion of the Project, the Government will prepare and submit to the Bank a\nProject Completion Report on the execution and operation of the Project facilities including the\ncosts and the compliance with Loan covenants.\n11.\t Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n91. Benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) will be conducted by DGE, assisted by\nPMO and PMUs. At the commencement of Project implementation, benchmark information will\nbe prepared by PMUs in connection with the preparation of the socioeconomic profiles in each\nvillage prior to the initiation of community organization/mobilization and key farmers training\nprogram.\n92. Benefit monitoring will be based on the CAPs that are developed by the\nbeneficiaries and PPLS will monitor the results of these action plans. The progress will be\nsummarized by the concerned PMUs and transmitted to the PMO each quarter. The PMO will\nincorporate the summaries of these benefit monitoring reports into the semi-annual progress\nreport for submission to DGE and the Bank.", "20\n93. The Project consultants will advise and assist PMO with respect to (i) designing\nthe detailed implementation arrangements for all BME activities, (ii) supervising the preparation\nof detailed procedures for BME activities, and (iii) assisting and advising on the engagement  of\nNGOs and trainers for training PPLs and PMU staff.\n94.\t At Project completion, DGE will evaluate the Project benefits following a schedule\nand with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and DGE.\nH.\t The Executing Agencies\n95. The lead EA is DGE, supported by DGFCH, DGLS and AARD (see para. 70).\nDGE is the main Government agency responsible for tree crop development in Indonesia and\nhas over 20 years experience in project implementation. Several Bank-financed projects are\namong the foreign-funded projects implemented by this agency.1' DGE has been using the\nPMU approach for smallholder tree crop development and  it has been able to successfully plant\n40,000 ha of tree crops a year. These projects have involved several components such as food\ncrops, tree crops, household animals, infrastructure and soil conservation. There is no other\nsingle agency which covers the full range of these activities. Previous involvement in\nimplementing the NES Oil Palm Project in lrian Jaya has given DGE considerable experience\nin land development in this remote province. Thus, DGE's project implementation experience\nwould be of considerable value to the Project.\n96. While DGE is an effective EA, it has only modest experience in the community-\nbased approach. The Project will therefore ensure that in each Project area, DGE will\ncollaborate with a local NGO, for advice and training of PPLs in community-based approaches.\nThe Project's community development consultants will establish these arrangements and\nsupervise the training of the PPLs.\nI.\t Environment and Social Measures\n1.\t Environment\n97. The Project is designed to enhance the economic life of the rural poor population\nand prevent further damage to the tropical forest ecosystem. An Initial Environment Examination\n(lEE) completed during the feasibility stage concluded that the potential impacts of the Project\non the physical and social environments are generally positive and that minor negativeimpacts\ninherent in road rehabilitation and improvement and land preparation activities can be easily\nmitigated by appropriate measures. The Project provides preventive and conservation measures\nthrough its crop and soil conservation support components. Crop rotation with legumes and\norganic mulching techniques will be introduced. In the district of Jayawijaya, the Project will\npromote the production of organic arabica coffee and chemical-free food crops that are currently\nbeing cultivated by the indigenous farmers. Increased crop yields and farm production will help\nto diminish the pressure to extend cultivation to marginal, sloping and other land under\nperennial vegetative cover. Legume conservation strips will be established in degraded hill\nslopes to prevent further land degradation. Thus the combined effect of using appropriate\nagronomic and crop rotation practices, and extensive direct training  of farmers and other user\ngroups, including women, in natural resource conservation, will help control further damage to\nland under shifting cultivation and will improve the agro-ecology and environment in the medium\nto long term.\nLoan No. 687-INO: NES Oil Palm Project, for $57.0 million, approved on 28 August\n1984; Loan No. 789-lNO: Second NES Oil Palm Project, for $70.0 million, approved on\n23 September 1986; Loan No. 111 8-INO: Tree Crop Smallholder Sector Project, for $135\nmillion, approved on 14 November 1991; and Loan No. 1184-INO: Upland Farmer\nDevelopment Project, for $28.08 million, approved on 5 November 1992.", "21\n98. The PSL facilities at the University of Cenderawasih in Manokwari will be\nupgraded to carry out (i) environmental impact assessments, environmental monitoring and\nmanagement surveys, and other studies, and (ii) training to promote sustainable agricultural\ndevelopment throughout the province. Agricultural extension officers from the local extension\ncenters as well as indigenous farmers will be trained at PSL in environment conservation\npractices. The Project will launch through PSL a public awareness program to promote farmers'\nsensitivity to environmental issues.\n99. The basic strategy for environmental management will be the introduction of\nlegumes into the crop/tallow cycle to arrest fertility decline and allow an increased frequency of\ncultivation. This will reduce the need to open new land and will lower labor input in land\npreparation. Planting tree crops and introducing legume conservation strips are other strategies\naimed at protecting the environment from further degradation.\n2.\t Social Analysis\n100. The Project adopts a beneficiary participatory approach in the implementation of\nthe Project activities. Socio-anthropology and rapid social appraisal surveys conducted during\nProject preparation generated basic information essential for further social analysis. The first\nimportant task in implementation is to undertake a socioeconomic profile for each village\ncommunity. This will be followed by community organization and mobilization. In this process,\nthe coordinated inputs of the community development advisors, women-in-development\nspecialist, social-anthropologist and training specialists are vital to carry out the social\npreparation process of the target beneficiaries. The initial social preparation will be carried out\nby PPLs assisted by community development advisor and followed by training key farmers and\ndeveloping an action plan by the beneficiary. The action plan will take into account the\ncommunity needs and aim towards achieving a sustainable agriculture production system.\nDuring the implementation process, extensive BME will be carried out.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.\t Financial and Economic Analysis\n1.\t Financial Analysis\n101. The Project will directly benefit 28,000 farm households in 16 kecamatans\n(subdistricts) of Inan Jaya. These direct beneficiaries represent some 15 per cent of the total\npopulation of the targeted kecamatans, where nine traditional ethnic groups are found. Most\nProject participants are hard-core poverty peasants living in isolated hamlets, practicing shifting\ncultivation supplemented by fishing, hunting and gathering of forest products. Currently, their\nannual household income ranges from $260 to $490, which is below the poverty level of $500\nper annum (assuming five people per household). With the implementation of the Project, the\nannual household incomes will increase to $550 (for lowland food crop farmers), $580 (for\nhighland food crop farmers), $830 (for lowland cashew and food crop farmers), $920 (for\nlowland cocoa and food crop farmers) and $1,400 (for highland coffee and food crops farmers).\nThe farm model analysis that compares the incremental income between the with and without\nproject situations is shown in Appendix 5. Additionally, significant income increases or\nnutritional improvements can be expected with the expansion in fruit production and household\nanimals.\n102. The 11,000 farmers participating in the tree crop production will receive wages\nfor land clearing and conservation work and for maintenance work before the trees are mature\nenough to bear fruit. The credit for tree crop establishment will be provided to participating\nfarmers at an annual interest rate based on the certificate rate of Bank Indonesia with a grace\nperiod of five years. Cash flow analysis using the ceiling of 21 per cent is shown in Tables 8-10\nof Appendix 5. Farmers will be able to repay their loan within 10 to 13 years after crop\nestablishment while retaining incremental cash flow during the period of credit repayment.", "22\n103. At full development of the Project, farm productivity will increase significantly, with\nthe annuai incremental rise in output of the major crops estimated at 2,700 tons of cocoa, 2,400\ntons of arabica coffee, 2,500 tons of cashew, 13,500 tons of sweet potatoes, 1,650 tons of maize\nand 6,250 tons of vegetables and other annual crops. The farm-gate value of the produce is\nestimated at $14 million. Exports of tree crop produce will generate annual foreign exchange\nearnings of about $8 million.\n2.\t Economic Analysis\n104. In constant 1993 prices, the Project is estimated to yield  an economic internal rate\nof return (EIRR) of 15 per cent over Its economic life of 25 years (see Appendix 5, Table 13).\nEIRR has been computed with the full investment costs for rural infrastructure, environment\nmanagement, farming system research and other support services, but without the benefit from\nthose services, because they are not readily quantifiable.\n105. Other major assumptions included in the economic analysis are (i) a physical\nimplementation period of six years; (ii) economic prices of cocoa and coffee based on the latest\nWorld Bank price projections for agricultural commodities, expressed in constant 1993 dollars\nand adjusted for transport, handling, and other marketing charges; (iii) a shadow wage rate for\nlabor at 80 per cent of the existing wages; and (iv) the exclusion of all transfer payment. Details\nof the assumptions used are given in Appendix 5.\n3.\t Sensitivity Analysis\n106. A sensitivity analysis carried out to test the viability of the Project with various\nadverse changes show that the Project is economically viable. Either a 10 per cent drop in\nrevenue or a 10 per cent rise in cost would not depress the EIRR below 12 per cent. A one-year\ndelay in benefit accrual lowers the base case EIRR by less than two percentage points. The\nworst situation is assumed when a 10 per cent decline in Project revenue is accompanied by\nan unanticipated cost overrun of the same magnitude. Even under such an adverse condition,\nthe EIRR remains at about 11 per cent, suggesting the Project is economically viable.\n4.\t Project Risks\n107. The major risks that could adversely affect implementation of the Project relate\nto slower-than-anticipated adoption rate of improved farming practices arising from the\nremoteness of the Project sites and less-than-full participation by the indigenous farmers in\nProject planning and implementation. A secondary risk relates to inappropriate implementation\nand soil conservation technologies, particularly of the vegetative terraces in alley cropping\nsystems, which could result in lower-than-expected benefits to environmental aspects of the\nProject. Special emphasis is given by the Project to prepare and organize indigenous farmers\ninto groups by PMUs with the assistance of local NGOs and provide intensive training at least\none year prior to on-farm investment. The farming system to be introduced will be tested on\nfarmers' fields prior to on-farm development, which will serve to verify the technologies and to\nillustrate the benefits of improved farming systems. The emphasis given to rural infrastructure\ndevelopment, institutional strengthening and support services is aimed at abating some of the\nrisks associated with the Project. The Project organizational structure is carefully designed to\nensure that timely staffing and logistic support is provided to the PMUs at the field level. The\nprovision of an extensive farmers' training program, including a special program for women, and\nfarming system research in all ecological zones ensure that appropriate farming practices and\nproduction technology will be adopted by indigenous farmers in a timely manner. The\nsocioeconomic baseline and soil survey and a mid-term review in year three are part of an\noverall effort to mitigate Project pitfalls and ensure timely provision of corrective measures when\nnecessary.", "23\nB.\t Environmental and Social Dimensions\n1.\t Environmental Impact\n108. An lEE concluded that the proposed Project would have positive impact in\nstabilizing the environment through rational land use and soil conservation measures. Based on\nthese positive impacts, no detailed environment impact assessment is required.\n109. The development of tree crops and the planting of legume conservation strips will\nhave important positive effects on the soil and minor effects on the hydrology of the area. Tree\ncrops may result in lower surface runoff and the tree legume strips will form wind breaks that\nameliorate the adverse effects of the strong highland winds. The key aspects of soil\nimprovement are reduced soil erosion, slumps and land slides and improved fertility and\nphysical status of the soil by improving the cropping systems. The planting of tree crops and\nlegume strips will provide ground cover to reduce surface erosion. The deeper root systems\nwill stabilize the soil against mass movement and bring nutrients to the surface. The legumes\nwill fix nitrogen and the combination of tree crops with legume strips will provide organic matter\nfrom mulch and leaf litter. There may be some minor negative effects during land preparation\nbut these will be minimized by the use of manual methods in clearing and by the planting of\nlegume cover crops during the establishment phase.\n110. The rotation of legumes with food and vegetable crops, and, where land pressure\nis less, the planting of legume fallow crops when the land is not in use, will preserve and\nincrease the soil fertility and thereby reduce the need for using the traditional swidden system.\nAreas in the Baliem valley have been continuously under food crops and legumes for five years\nwithout any decline in soil fertility, using conservation farming techniques. Water quality in terms\nof run oft and sediment load is expected to improve under the Project. During implementation\nit will be important to understand that the construction of bench terraces, so popular in Java,\nwhere some very stable soils occur, should be actively resisted. Making bench terraces and\nconstructing bunds that impound water may cause iandslips in the predominantly sedimentary\nsoils of the Project areas.\n111. Road rehabilitation and improvement may generate some negative impacts if it\nis not done with due regard to drainage aspects. Roads cut into the sides of hills without\nadequate drainage may encourage excessive infiltration of water, causing the soil to become\nfluid and prone to slips. Furthermore, exposure of the soil during road construction causes\nerosion especially if untrained construction crews sidecast soil into drainage lines. Roads\nshould be adequately graded to allow run off of excess water, and banks and other exposed\nsurfaces should be planted with cover crops as soon as the earthworks are completed.\nExposed areas should be completely seeded with legume crops or grasses that will form an\neffective cover.\n112. Impacts on flora and fauna are not likely to be significant as the proposed\ndevelopment areas support a mixture of low secondary growth, temporary arable crops and\ngrassland as part of the shifting cultivation system. In these circumstances clearing vegetation\nfor cropping is not usually environmentally damaging. None of the development areas possess\ntheir original assembly of species and in some instances very considerable reduction and\nsimplification has occurred because of previous farming activities. No rare or endangered\nspecies are known to be involved. The Project plans to promote low input technology with a\nminimal use of fertilizers and pesticides, and, in the Baliem valley area, small quantity of 'organic\ncoffee' is currently being produced for the export market. Organically grown vegetables are\nbeing produced by indigenous farmers and sold to Free Port. The rules for organic crop\nproduction are stringent and involve inspections and the acquisition of licenses, the use of pest-\nresistant plant varieties, crop rotation and intercropping and quarantine and crop hygiene.\nThese procedures will be promoted under the Project so that the effect of agricultural chemicals\non insects, other wildlife and water quality will be minimal.\n113. No serious social or cultural tensions are discernible at present, and Project\nactivities that will lead to a higher standard of living are more likely to be positive than negative.", "24\nNo changes in land ownership wifl occur under the Project and the issue of land tenure does\nnot arise. Tree crops will be developed under a lease arrangement with ownership groups, or\nwill take place on communally owned land with the full knowledge and participation of those\ngroups. The economic aspects of the Project will be positive and beneficial and the increase in\nfarm produce and access to markets can be expected to promote entrepreneurial activities in\nthe area.\n2.\t SocIal Dimensions\n(a) Women In Development\n114. The gender dMsion of labor in indigenous Inan societies allocates distinct and\nseparate activities for males and females. Traditionally, males were assigned the primary tasks\nof warfare, politics and ritual, and women were assigned food production and other family\nsubsistence activities. Besides politics and warfare, men's work also involves heavy land\nclearing, the felling and barking of sago trees, hunting and fishing, making and maintaining\nfences to keep out pigs, preparing raised beds for planting root crops and constructing and\nrepairing buildings. Women's work involves agricultural food production, harvesting crops,\nmarketing surplus agricultural produce, raising pigs, gathering and carrying firewood and water,\nchild care and other domestic chores.\n115. Recognizing that agriculture is traditionally assigned to women in Irian society,\nthe Project has a women-in-development program to ensure that women are not marginalized\nor displaced by the Project, have access to Project inputs and receive Project benefits. The\nwomen-in-development program has been devised to mitigate potential negative consequences\nof expanding tree crops into both the male sphere of activity and into the Irianese farming\nsystem. Experience elsewhere has shown the introduction of cash crops can and often does\nincrease women's workloads since they must contribute labor to cash crops in addition to their\nnormal tasks of food production.\n116. The Project's emphasis on food crop production is designed to increase yields\nand reduce the time and energy required for food production. The Project will help introduce\nsimple cultivation technology, high yielding varieties and cropping systems that will significantly\nincrease farm yields per unit area, thereby reducing the time required for food production\nactivities. Extensive training on improved farm production techniques and sustainable farming\nsystems will be provided to women farmers. Also, women farmers will be assisted with the\nsupply of inputs such as improved seeds and planting materials, fruit tree seedlings, farm tools\nand extension advice. The provision of village water supply systems will also contribute to\nreducing women's time in fetching water from distant sources.\n117. Women's work load could also be lightened by providing conservation strips\n(trees) near the villages. Firewood collection, one of the women's many routine chores, would\nno longer need to be carried out over long distances. The conservation strips would also\nstabilize the soils and protect the natural forests from further depletion.\n118. Overall, the Project will seek to ensure equal participation of women in all Project\nactivities and especially in new techniques of farm and tree crop management. A women-in-\ndevelopment specialist and two community development advisors will promote and facilitate\nwomen's involvement and participation in the overall project. Information and training in areas\nsuch as family planning, health, nutrition, sanitation and child care will also be made available\nto women. Women-in-development centers will be provided by the Project to serve as venues\nfor activities related to women's issues.\n(b)\t Health Improvement\n119. Apart from income generation, the food crop improvement program will enhance\nthe level of food security of participating households. Increases in food crop commodities and\nlivestock will expand the range of nutritious food available to the local community, leading to\nan improvement in general health. Health improvement will be further augmented by the", "25\nprovision of spring-ted water supply systems and the construction of shallow wells in the\ntargeted villages. This will reduce villagers' dependence on surface water for domestic\nconsumption, thereby lowering their exposure to waterbome parasites and hence the incidence\nof sickness and diseases related to the intake of stream and river water. The development of\nshallow wells and spring-fed water supply will also eliminate the need for women and children\nto ferry water from distant streams.\n(c)\t AccessibIlity\n120. The rural road rehabilitation and maintenance program will not only improve\nphysical access to settlements and farm holdings, but, more importantly, will enlarge villagers'\naccessibility to off-farm, nontarm opportunities. More accessible settlements implies that both\nthe marketing of farm produce and the delivery of goods and services to the villages will be\ngreatly facilitated, leading to a rise in farm-gate prices and a general concomitant reduction in\nprices of goods imported from outside. It also means that agricultural extension services, health\ncare, and a host of other social services could be rendered more effectively.\n121. Access improvement would also engender a process of innovation diffusion,  an\nessential element for economic growth and social progress. Many of the indigenous tribal\ngroups are still very much shielded from external influences. Lack of contact with the outside\nworld impedes technology transfer and cultural exchanges, hindering social and economic\nprogress. The rural infrastructure development program will expose the indigenous tribes to\nactivities outside their community, facilitate the flows of information and knowledge, and put\nthem in touch with developments external to their society.\n122. While efforts will be directed toward the development of sustainable agricultural\nmodels in the targeted villages, the replicability of these models for comparable agro-ecologicai\nzones is equally important. The present feeble transport infrastructure will not be sufficient to\neffectively disseminate extension information to the remote hamlets. Thus, the rural road\ndevelopment program will play a pivotal role in propagating these models to different parts of\nthe province. The ultimate beneficiaries will not be confined to the Project participants, but will\ninclude the provincial population at large.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n123. The Government and DGE have given the following assurances, in addition to the\nstandard assurances that have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) Within three months of loan effectiveness, DGE will appoint a Project\nUaison Officer as a coordinator at the central level on all matters relating\nto Project implementation.\n(ii) Within three months of loan effectiveness, DGE, will appoint the Project\nManager and set up PMO in the provincial capital, Jayapura, to manage\nProject implementation.\n(iii) At the district level, PMUs will be established at the Project sites prior to\nProject implementation in the concerned districts. The PMU Head will be\nresponsible for organizing and training farmer groups and implementing\nProject activities in collaboration with the smallholders. Each PMU will\ncomprise implementation subunits responsible for implementing Project\nactivities at each of the Project sites.\n(iv) Environmental monitoring will be instituted during the construction and\nimplementation of the Project to ensure minimal adverse environmental\nimpacts. Both preventive and conservation measures will be taken\nthrough the crop and soil conservation support components of the\nProject.", "26\n(v) The Government will continue to respect the existing traditional land rights\nand arrangements recognized by the traditional societies.\n(vi) Dunng the first year that tree crop areas are being developed, financial\nsupport will be provided to the smaliholder farmers through the\nGovernment's development budget in accordance with the Government's\nstrategy on poverty reduction. Subsequent assistance for operation and\nmaintenance will be provided through credits at a variable market-related\ninterest rate acceptable to the Bank.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n124.

The economic life of the Project for financial and economic evaluation has\nbeen taken to be 25 years, corresponding to the average economic productive life of tree\ncrops to be adopted in the Project.\n2. Prices\n3. Economic prices of traded farm outputs and input are derived from World\nBank Price Projections for International Commodities published in November 1992. The\nprojected economic and financial farm-gate prices of major farm produces and inputs are\nderived by making appropriate adjustments to account for any quality differences to bring\nthe world market prices to border prices and then adjusting for processing, freight, handling\nand distribution costs. The derived prices are summarized in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3 show\nthe detailed derivations for cocoa and coffee, respectively. Other price derivations are given\nin Supplementary Appendix G. All prices used are expressed in 1993 constant terms.\n4. The exchange rate used in deriving 'farm-gate prices for traded goods is Rp\n2,050 to $1.00, which was the prevailing market exchange rate at the time of Project\nappraisal in March 1993. Local and indirect foreign currency costs were converted using a\nstandard conversion factor of 0.9.\n5. The economic value of agricultural labor is determined by its marginal\neconomic value in alternative employment, which will depend upon seasonally varying\nemployment opportunities. Most of the labor force in lnan Jaya is employed in agriculture.\nOff-farm jobs are available near the urban centers and 1n mining areas at wage rates\nsomewhat below those in agriculture. Therefore, the economic wage rate was estimated to\nbe 80 per cent of the current market wage rate of Rp. 2,500 per day.\n6. The Project costs comprise: (i) costs of all land preparation and civil works,\nincluding upgrading of farm roads, culverts and water supply systems; (ii) costs of planting\nmaterials, farm tools and agro-chemicals; (iii) costs of equipment and vehicles, including\ntheir replacements and operating costs; (iv) costs of training, technical support and\nconsulting services; and (v) costs of administration, maintenance and management.\nPhysical contingencies are provided at 5 per cent for both capital and operating costs. Price\ncontingencies are provided at 3.7 per cent for both the local and foreign exchange costs.\n3.\t Benefit Quantification\n7.\t The following assumptions are used in the computation of benefits resulting\nfrom the implementation of the project:\n(References in text: page 21, paras 101 and 102; page 22, paras 104-106)", "\t\n42\nAppendix 5\nPage 2\na)\t Food Crop Component\n8. The 1 ,000 on-farm trials and demonstration plots will lead directly to increased\nfood production through the adoption of new farming technology (high yielding varieties,\ncrop rotation, and legume fallow) by participating farmers. Each trial will serve one farmer\ngroup, the average size of which is 20 farm families. By the end of the Project life, the\nadoption rate is assumed to have reached 75 per cent, indicating that 15,000 farm\nhouseholds will have acquired the new farming technology.\n9. The typical food crop model will cover 0.5 ha comprising sweet potatoes (0.3\nha), maize (0.05 ha), mixed legumes (0.1 ha) and mixed vegetables (0.05 ha).\n10. The rehabilitation of planting material multiplication centers at Oransbari,\nTeminabuan, Mimika Timur and Asologaima and the development of planting material\nproduction centers will contribute to the production of high yielding quality seeds for\ndistribution to farmers. The quantifiable benefits associated with this subcomponent will be\nincreased food production among farm families embracing the new farming technology.\n11. The planting of conservation strips, apart from helping to stabilize the soils,\nwill produce about 2 tons of fire wood per ha a year with an estimated value of $25 per ton.\nb) Tree Crops\n12. The benefits are increased cocoa, coffee, and cashew production resulting\nfrom either rehabilitation (only for cocoa) or new development. Without Project benefits for\nnew plantings are assumed to be zero. For cocoa rehabilitation, the Without Project benefits\nare as per existing production, which is assumed to gradually decline to zero by year 6.\nB.\t Farm Model Analysis\n13. The typical food crop model has a cultivated area of 0.5 ha, consisting of 0.3\nha of sweet potatoes; 0.05 ha of maize; 0.1 ha of mixed legumes (soya bean, groundnuts,\nand mung bean); and 0.05 ha of mixed vegetables. Except for sweet potatoes, which are\nsingle-cropped, double-cropping is assumed for maize, mixed legumes and vegetables.\n14. The size of existing cocoa farms range from 0.5 to 0.8 ha. Under the\nrehabilitation program, these farms would be expanded to 1 ha each. Inputs for crop\nestablishment including labor, seedlings, fertilizers, agro-chemicals, and tools would be\nprovided. Highland farmers participating in arabica coffee planting would cultivate a 1 ha\nholding over two years. The cropping area for farmers involved in cashew development\nwould be 1 ha per household.\n15. Results of farm model and cash flow analysis under different cropping\nscenarios are presented in Tables 4 to 11.\n16. Annual labor availability is taken to be 325 person-days, which is computed as\nfollows:\n0.8 person-day for women over 250 working days = 200 person-days\n0.5 person-day for men over 250 working days = 125 person-days", "43\nAppendix 5\nPage 3\nC.\t Rates of Return\n17. The results of Project economic analysis is presented in Table 13. The Project\nis estimated to yield an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about 15 per cent.\nSensitivity tests were carried out to assess the viability of the Project under several scenarios\nof adverse changes in costs and benefits. The results are presented in Table 14. The test\nshowed that the Project remains viable at about 11 per cent under the situation of a 10 per\ncent drop in revenue accompanied by an unanticipated cost overrun of the same magnitude.", "44\nAppendix 5\nPage 4\nTable 1: Derived Farm-gate Prices of Prolect Produce and Inputs\n(Constant 1993 Prices)\nFinancial Prices\t Average\t Economic Prices\t Average\n1995 2000 2005 1995-2005 1995 2000 2005 1995-2005\nFarm Produce\nCocoa (Rplkg) /\t 1,334 1,525 1,733\t 1 ,1 2\t 1,482 1,694 1,925\t 1,790\nCoffee (Rp/kg) /\t 2,043 2,640 2,448\t 2,405\t 2,127 2,664 2,491\t 2,453\nCashew Nuts (Rp/kg) /\t 2,500 2,500 2,500\t 2,500\t 2,778 2,778 2,778\t 2,778\nSweet Potatoes (Rp/kg) /\t 125\t 125\t 125\t 125\t 125\t 125\t 125\t 125\nMaize (Rp/kg) /\t 538\t 550\t 512\t 525\t 598\t 612\t 568\t 583\nGroundnuts (Rp/kg) /\t 846 788\t 666\t 726\t 940\t 876\t 740\t 807\nSoyaBeans(Rp/kg)\t 821\t 790\t 819\t 814\t 912\t 878\t 910\t 904\nMung Beans (Rp/kg)  800 800 800\t 800\t 800 800 800\t 800\nP1\t\nInputs\nUrea (Rp/kg)  584\t 628\t 601\t 603\t 531\t 571\t 546\t 548\nJ\t\nTn-Super Phosphate (Rp/kg)\t 521\t 533\t 528\t 528\t 474\t 485\t 480\t 480\nMuriate of Potash (Rp/kg)\t 513\t 511\t 506\t - 508\t 466\t 464\t 460\t 462\nRock Phosphate (Rp/kg) /\t 349 349 346\t 347\t 315\t 315\t 315\t 315\nPlanting Materials \nP1\nCocoa (Rp/seedling)\t 500\t 500\t 500\t 500\t 450\t 450\t 450\t 450\nCoffee (Rp/seedling)\t 250\t 250\t 250\t 250\t 225\t 225\t 225\t 225\nCashew (Rp/seedling)\t 110\t 110\t 110\t 110\t 99\t 99\t 99\t 99\nSweet Potatoes (Rp/cutting)\t 5\t 5\t 5\t 5\t 5\t 5\t 5.\t 5\nMaize (Rp/kg)\t 600 600 600\t 600\t 540 540 540\t 540\nGroundnuts (Rp/kg)\t 2,000 2,000 2,000\t 2,000\t 1,800 1,600 1,800\t 1,800\nSoya Beans (Rp/kg)\t 1,500 1,500 1,500\t 1,500\t 1,350 1,350 1,350\t 1,350\nMung Beans (Rp/kg)\t 1,200 1,200 1,200\t 1,200\t 1,080 1,080 1,080\t 1,080\nLabor (Rp/man- day)\t 2,500 2,500 2,500\t 2,500\t 2,000 2,000 2,000\t 2,000\n/ eased on World Bank Commodity Price Projections, November 1992.
