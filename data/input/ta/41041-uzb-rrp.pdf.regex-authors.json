In \nparticular, the capacity building will include support to build Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF)  capacity  in  the  maintenance  of  the  GFMIS  and \nmanagement of associated databases. \n ", "ii   \n  The second component will comprise development and implementation \nof  a  GFMIS.  It  will  provide  financing  for  (i) procurement, setting  of \nparameters,  installation  and  deployment  of  an  integrated  treasury \nsoftware  application  package  with  associated  documentation  and \ntraining services; (ii) supply of main servers for the central treasury \noffice and a back-up processing center in Tashkent; (iii) supply of the \ncomputers and networking items to equip the treasury offices being \nestablished  throughout  Uzbekistan;  (iv)  procurement  of \ntelecommunications equipment; and (v) local area networking, including \ndedicated  local  telecommunication  lines,  local  area  network \ninfrastructure, power supply, monitoring, and alarm systems for local \noffices. \n \n  The  third  component  will  comprise  establishment  of  a  project \n  management office (PMO) under  MOF to manage day-to-day project \nactivities. The PMO will work in close cooperation with MOF, Treasury, \nand its offices at central and local levels. \n \nRationale   The  proposed  Project  is  in  line  with  the  principles  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB) country strategy and  program (CSP)  for \nUzbekistan, endorsed by ADB\u2019s Board  of Directors in March 2006. It \naims to support the country\u2019s transition to a market-based economy \nand promote good governance. Uzbekistan has recently developed a \npublic finance management (PFM) reform strategy which outlines an \naction plan for the next 12 years to (i) establish a functioning treasury \nsystem,  (ii)  adopt  and  implement  a  modern  unified  budget  and \naccounting  system,  and  (iii)  introduce  a  medium-term  budget \nframework (MTBF) and program budgeting. The Project will provide \nsupport mainly for implementing  and refining the PFM strategy.  The \nPFM reform will have significant implications for the country\u2019s economic \nmanagement, leading to more effective and efficient  management of \npublic  resources.  The  proposed  Project  will  also  provide  a  good \nfoundation for future dialogue and cooperation between the authorities \nand ADB in further PFM reform over the next 10\u201312 years.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The project impact will be improved planning and utilization of public \nresources.  The  project  outcome  will  be  improved  effectiveness, \nefficiency,  transparency  and  accountability  of  budget  execution \nprocesses.  The  Project  impact  and  outcome  will  be  monitored and \nmeasured mainly by the performance indicators as described in paras. \n9\u201310 of the main text, and  the design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $37.36 million. The \ncost estimates include $3.95 million for taxes and duties, $1.28 million \nfor physical and price contingencies, and estimated financing charges \nduring implementation (comprising interest during implementation and \na commitment charge) of $2.61 million. \n   ", "  iii \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $20.70 million from  ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum  on  undisbursed  loan  amount,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Borrower will be \nthe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan.  The  requested  level  of  financing  will \ncomprise 55% of the total project cost. The Government will contribute \n$16.66  million  toward  the  project  cost,  including  $10  million  for \nfinancing refurbishment of treasury offices nationwide, $2.61 million for \nfinancing charges during implementation, and $3.95 million in taxes \nand duties.  \n \n \n \n   Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Source  Total  Percent \n  Asian Development Bank  20.70  55 \n  Government of Uzbekistan  16.66  45 \n    Total  37.36  100 \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 July 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 January 2012  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  4  years.  Project \nArrangements  activities will include the selection of a vendor for development and \ninstallation of the GFMIS, procurement of hardware and networking \nequipment,  and  development  and  implementation  of  a  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system. The  establishment of \nthe treasury institutional network and support for  capacity building in \nbudget reform will be implemented in line with progress in development \nand implementation of the GFMIS.  \n \nProcurement  Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nGovernment will furnish a project procurement plan for ADB approval. \nThe Government will implement the procurement plan as approved by \nADB, and  will update the procurement plan annually, or as needed. \nADB  will  disclose  the  plan  and  its  updates  to  the  public  after  the \napproval of related financing. Major contracts to be financed by ADB\u2019s \nloan  for  information  technology  (IT)  software  and  equipment  and \ncosting  $0.5  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  awarded  through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). \n \n ", "iv   \n  Shopping procedure will be used for contracts valued at $100,000 \nequivalent or less. For the procurement of items  valued at less than \n$10,000, the Executing Agency (EA) may purchase the items directly \nfrom the supplier. In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price \npaid is reasonable.  \n \n  All goods and services financed by the loan will be procured from ADB \nmember countries. In addition, where the value of goods financed by \nthe loan exceeds $1 million, a preshipment certificate from a reputable \nagency acceptable to ADB may be required. The award of all contracts \nand substantial contract variations will be subject to prior approval by \nADB. \n \nConsulting Services  About 10 IT specialists from MOF will be trained in the following areas: \n(i) database administration, (ii) operational systems engineering, and \n(iii) network technology engineering. The training and certification will \nbe  provided  during  the  first  year  of  project  implementation  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time), under a contract between the PMO and an \nauthorized  IT  certification  company  engaged  on  the  basis  of \nconsultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n \nAn international IT and procurement consultant will provide 8 person-\nmonths  of  consultancy  input  to  assist  the  PMO  in  conducting  ICB \nprocurements  of  the  various  GFMIS  components,  in  particular  the \ndevelopment and implementation of the GFMIS software (procurement \npackage 1). MOF will engage an individual international consultant in \naccordance with ADB procedures for recruiting individual consultants.  \n \nTechnical Assistance  The  outcome  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  will  be \nstrengthened capacity of the Government in budget preparation and \nexecution using the revised budget classification. The TA project will \naddress the immediate capacity-building needs and focus on the areas \nnot covered by other donors either now or in the near future. \n \nThe  TA  project  will  have  two  components:  (i)  support  for  budget \npreparation,  and  (ii)  support  for  budget  execution  through  treasury \noperations using the GFMIS. The  TA project outputs will comprise (i) \ndevelopment  of  user  manuals  on  budget  preparation  and  treasury \noperation under the revised budget classifications; (ii) development of \ntraining modules and materials in budget preparation and execution \nusing the revised budget classification system; (iii) development of \nperformance indicators for the education sector; and (iv) training of 17 \nstaff from MOF Treasury, Budget Department, and Treasury Training \nCenter  in  budget  preparation  and  budget  execution  based  on  the \nrevised budget classification. \n \n ", "  v \n  The TA project will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting \nin January 2008. MOF will be the EA for the TA project. MOF Budget \nDepartment  will  be  the  main  counterpart  for  budget  preparation \nactivities while the Treasury will coordinate the budget execution. The \nTA project will require  international (24 person-months) and national \n(48 person-months) consultants with the following areas of expertise: (i) \nperformance-based  budget  preparation,  and  (ii)  budget  execution \nthrough  treasury  operations.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  The major benefits of the Project will be indirect, and will be reflected in \nBeneficiaries  (i) improved budget quality, (ii) budget execution efficiency and linkage \nbetween budgeting and policy objectives as well as program outcomes, \n(iii) greater transparency and accountability in PFM, underpinned by the \nestablished treasury institutional network and modern treasury system; \nand  (iv)  progress  in  the  introduction  of  the  MTBF  and  program \nbudgeting. Direct economic benefits of the Project  will be the savings \nderived  from  better  cash  management  and  thus  reduced  interest \npayments. \n \nBeneficiaries of the Project will include (i) policy makers and institutions \nwho,  with  the  help  of  the  modern  treasury,  will  be  able  to  make \ndecisions and, if necessary, fiscal adjustments, based on  the timely \navailability of better-classified information; (ii) stakeholders, including the \ngeneral public and parliament, who will  be able to better assess and \nmonitor the effect of the PFM; and (iii) the general public, who will \nbenefit  from  the  provision  of  public  goods  and  services  that  are \nfacilitated by improved payment and budget execution processes. \n  \nRisks and  The continued Government commitment to, and ownership of, the PFM \nAssumptions  reform will be crucial for the Project\u2019s success and the achievement of \nthe intended outcome and impact. This is especially true when reform \nin the MTBF and program budgeting becomes further advanced. It is \nrecognized that this is a long-term, complex task and sometimes an \niterative process, and will require institutional changes and significant \ncapacity building of relevant institutions, especially in formulation of \nsector policies and development of performance indicators to measure \nand  monitor  the  effect  of  the  reform.  Currently,  the Government is \nreceiving  assistance  in  this  area  from  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) and European Union Technical Assistance to the \nCommonwealth of Independent States (TACIS). It is unclear to date \nwhether this assistance will be adequate, as the needs may evolve. \nConsequently this will be one of the main areas for future dialogue \nbetween the Government and ADB. Depending on the country\u2019s needs \nand  the  implementation  of  other  development-partner  programs  in \ncapacity  building,  ADB  will  design  its  future  program  in  this  area \naccordingly. \n \n ", "vi   \n  Another risk is that staff assigned to the newly established treasury \noffices will be inadequately skilled. To mitigate this risk, a targeted \ntraining program is planned. This program will be carefully sequenced \nin line with the progress in development and implementation of the \nGFMIS, and will include provisions that will help prevent the loss of key \ntrained staff. Ongoing and planned commitment by other development \npartners in this area will also help mitigate the risks. \n \nFrequent turnover of PMO staff is a potential risk. ADB will work with \nthe Government  to  minimize  staff  turnover  and  ensure  the  PMO  is \nequipped with competent, full-time staff. \n \n  Effective coordination with development partners will be important to \nmeet  the  country\u2019s  long-term  needs  for  capacity  building.  Such \ncoordination during the project preparation stage has been very good; \nADB  will  work  to  maintain  close  cooperation.  The  fact  that  ADB\u2019s \nUzbekistan Resident Mission is leading the  project preparation and \nimplementation will help the coordination.  \n  ", "   \nv\nii", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Public Finance Management Reform Project.1 The report \nalso  describes  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  supporting  public  finance \nmanagement (PFM) reforms. If the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by  the Board, will \napprove the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Uzbekistan is the most populous country in the Central Asia region and has the second-\nlargest economy.  Located strategically in the center of the region, it borders the  four other \nCentral Asian countries, and Afghanistan. It is one of the few \u201cdouble land-locked\u201d countries in \nthe world (i.e., surrounded only by other landlocked countries). Uzbekistan has abundant natural \nresources, including gold, natural gas, copper and uranium. It has an economy dominated by \nagriculture,  with  almost  70%  of  the  population  living  in  rural  areas.  It  also  has  a  young \npopulation, with more than 50% of the people under the age of 19.   \n \n3.  At  independence  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  inherited  a  difficult  economic  situation.  The \neconomy then underwent significant changes, declining considerably until 1996 when it began \nto show some modest growth. Economic growth has accelerated during 2004-2006. The gross \ndomestic product (GDP) grew by 7.3% on average  during this period, compared with 4.2% \nduring 1999\u20132003. Favorable external prices of Uzbekistan\u2019s major exports and real growth of \nnoncommodity exports  have contributed  to  this  recent  growth. However, economic growth \nremains narrowly based and the economy has yet to realize its growth potential. Uzbekistan \nremains a low-income country, with per capita GDP estimated at $606 in 2006.  \n \n4.  The economy experienced significant macroeconomic imbalances until 2000. Since then \nmacroeconomic management has improved; monetary policies were tightened and distortions in \nexchange rates reduced, leading to unification of exchange rates and the introduction of current \naccount convertibility in October 2003. However, the overall progress in macroeconomic and \nstructural reforms has been mixed. There are many daunting challenges facing the country in \ncarrying out economic reforms, especially in the banking and trade sectors.  \n \n5.  Progress on the fiscal reform has been encouraging. Lending from the Central Bank of \nUzbekistan (CBU) to the budget has been discontinued. Government expenditure has been \nreduced from 45% of GDP in 1998 to about 32% in 2006. After reaching 10% of GDP in 1998\u2013\n1999, fiscal deficits were subsequently reduced significantly and have been largely eliminated \nsince 2004. Debt levels have improved with the adoption of prudent fiscal policy and a zero-net-\nborrowing strategy. A more detailed sector and subsector analysis is given in Appendix 2. \n  \n6.  After a number of years of piloting various elements of fiscal reforms, the Government \nhas adopted a long-term strategic approach to advancing the reform process. In May 2007, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) developed a PFM reform strategy for 2007\u20132018 (Appendix 3) with \nsupport from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department and ADB. The strategy outlines an action plan \n                                                 \n1  The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2   \n \nfor the next 12 years  which will (i) establish a functioning  treasury system; (ii) adopt and \nimplement a modern, unified budget and accounting system; and (iii) introduce a medium-term \nbudget framework (MTBF) and program budgeting. \n \n7.  A  central  element  of  the  PFM reform  is  to  improve the budget execution process \nsignificantly over the next 5 years. The PFM reform strategy has planned to set up a nationwide \nnetwork of treasury offices with a central treasury in MOF, local treasury departments at the \nregional2 (oblast) level and branches at the district (rayon) level. These  treasury offices will \nprovide services to the budget organizations of both national and subnational governments. It is \nalso planned to  consolidate the currently fragmented treasury  banking  operations  under a \ntreasury single account (TSA) at the CBU, to be supported by the computerized GFMIS. \n \n8.  The  PFM  reform  will  have  significant  implications  for  the  country\u2019s  economic \nmanagement. As envisaged by the strategy, the focus of the reform over the medium term (3\u20135 \nyears) will be mainly on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, and accountability \nof the budget execution process. Over the long term (10\u201312 years) the reform will gradually \nmove its focus to improving the results of the budget. \n \n9.  Key performance indicators to measure and monitor the progress and achievement of \nthe reform objective over the medium term include (i) the existence of a clear annual budget \ncalendar, (ii)  the requirement of  appropriation of  public expenditure by parliament, (iii)  the \nadoption  of  an  expenditure  commitment  control  scheme  that  can  effectively  limit  the \ncommitments  to  actual  cash  availability  to  approved  budget  allocations  for  most  types  of \nexpenditure, and (iv) the preparation and regular update of cash flow forecasts on the basis of \nactual cash inflows and outflows.  \n  \n10.  Key performance indicators over the long term include (i) linkage between budget and \npolicy objectives and programs; (ii)  budget preparation and allocation made with a multi-year \nperspective based on reasonable forecasts of major fiscal aggregate for the next 3 years; (iii) \ninclusion of cost implications in the preparation of  selected sector strategies; and (iv) annual \npublication of an approved and executed budget with a gradual increase in the coverage and \ncontent, moving toward greater uniformity with international standards and including economic, \nfunctional, administrative, and program classifications, as well as underlying policy assumptions. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems \n11.  Budget  Preparation.  Uzbekistan  inherited  the  budget  preparation  process  that  is \ncommon to all other countries that were part of the former Soviet Union.  Currently, budget \nentities prepare their budget requests largely on the basis of previous inputs rather according to \nclear policies and policy objectives linked  to defined  programs with performance indicators. \nMOF receives budget requests from a large number of budget agencies, many of which lack \ncapacity  in  making  policy  choices.  MOF  reviews  the  budget  requests  in  terms  of  their \nconsistency  with  current  regulations,  and  applies  cuts  mainly  to  the  fourth  category  of \nexpenditure,3 which often leads to a lack of funds for maintenance and current supplies.  The \n                                                 \n2 The 12 oblasts of Uzbekistan, the city of Tashkent, and the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n3 Total expenditures are classified into four major categories: (i) social sphere expenditure, (ii) expenditure on the \neconomy, (iii) expenditure on state power and administration, and (iv) other expenditures.  ", "3 \n \navailable time and data do not give MOF the opportunity to undertake in-depth analysis of the \nlinks between proposed or existing economic policies and the state budget scenarios.  \n \n12.  Until recently the budget also suffered from the lack of a medium-term perspective, such \nas  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  that  would  project  important  macroeconomic \nvariables\u2014including GDP, balance of payments, inflation, and interest rates\u2014over a 3\u20135-year \nperiod. Such an MTFF would form the basis for more reliable revenue estimates. In conjunction \nwith the  Government\u2019s deficit target, these revenue estimates would  (i) establish an overall \nspending limit, (ii) allow for the establishment of sector spending limits, and (iii) enable the \ndevelopment of a coherent and sustainable aggregate and sector expenditure policy. In effect \nthere are two budget preparation processes: the first covers the recurrent budget, the second \ncovers investment expenditures under the public investment program. The lack of a medium-\nterm perspective in the recurrent budget preparation, and lack of a link between the two budget \nprocesses, leads to inaccurate and incomplete costing of sector programs. As a result, this often \nleads to mismatches in recurrent and investment expenditure plans.  \n \n13.  There  is  no  medium-term,  bottom-up  budget  exercise  to  accompany  the  top-down \napproach underpinned by the MTFF.  Such an exercise  would properly  cost  and  evaluate \nexpenditure programs and allocate scarce public resources to those that are most effective. \n \n14.  A significant portion of general government expenditure is not covered by the budget \nprocess. In addition, most budget organizations are allowed to supplement their finances by \nraising budget revenues and retaining part of them in extra-budgetary funds. As a consequence, \npolicy decisions are often made without comprehensive analysis of the overall fiscal resource \nenvelopes and expenditure requirements. \n \n15.  Until recently the budget was prepared using a classification system that did not permit \nindependent functional and economic analysis. As there is a mix of functional elements and \neconomic  categories  in  the  budget  classification,  proper  evaluation  and  accountability  in \nassessing  the  budget\u2019s  effect  when  compared  against  government  policy  objectives  and \npriorities was not possible. \n \n16.  Budget  Execution.  Budget  execution  arrangements  are  fragmented,  resulting  in \ndispersal  of  cash  resources  and  weak  payment  control.  There  are  almost  50,000  budget \norganizations  controlling  over  100,000  bank  accounts,  mostly  in  commercial  banks.  Line \nministries  have  poor  control  over  the  budget  organizations  that  operate  in  their  areas  of \nresponsibility. Such organizational arrangements make it difficult for MOF to reconcile cash-\naccount balances and monitor budget execution effectively.  \n  \n17.  Budgetary monitoring and accounting is weak, and the system for fiscal reporting is \nelaborate but ineffective. Currently CBU submits a daily report on the aggregate cash position, \nwhile  line  ministries  prepare  a  monthly  report  on  cash  payments  (aggregated  by  broad \neconomic  categories)  and  detailed  quarterly  reports  that  cover  both  cash  payments  and \nexpenditures.  However,  this  reporting  system  is  not  sufficient  to  give  timely  and  complete \ninformation on budget execution, partly as the reports of the numerous spending units are \nprepared and processed manually. Such processing of reports is time consuming and as a \nresult detailed information for each spending unit is often not available to MOF, making cash \nplanning difficult. \n \n ", "4   \n \n18.  There is a lack of  segregation of duties, i.e., separation between the release of the \nauthority to spend and the release of cash to agencies, with cash being transferred to spending \nunits through the system of bank accounts of line ministries. This procedure allows spending \nagencies and the intermediate government institutions to build up idle cash balances, and thus \nincreases MOF\u2019s gross-borrowing requirements. \n \n19.  The accounting and reporting system is weak and cumbersome. Budget organizations \nand MOF\u2019s budget and financial departments in oblasts and rayons financed directly from MOF \nmaintain their accounts in accordance with a COA prescribed by the Government of the former \nSoviet Union in 1986. A separate COA is issued to account for periodic cash releases to line \nministries during the budget execution process. The budget and financial departments in oblasts \nand rayons use yet another COA to account for cash releases made to the budget organizations \nunder their jurisdiction. The CBU, its regional branches, and accredited commercial banks \ncontinue to record and report on government cash transactions in accordance with a COA that \ncaptures  major  economic categories of expenditure and tax revenues by type of taxes.  In \naddition, much of the accounting and reporting is processed manually. Because there is no \nuniform COA for government operations at different levels of  Government, MOF is able to \nconsolidate only  the  cash  account  for  the  central  government  on  a  regular  basis.  Budget \norganizations have to  reference other classification systems to account for and report other \ntransaction flows and stocks. A detailed sector and subsector analysis is presented in Appendix \n2. \n \n2.  Government Initiatives and Opportunities \n20.  Since 2000 the Government has undertaken measures to address these weaknesses.  \n  \n21.  Legal  Framework.  The  parliament  approved  the  Budget  System  Law  (BSL)  in \nDecember 2000, providing a legal basis for budget management. The law sets out the process \nof preparation of the annual budgets by the national and subnational governments. It also lays \ndown the parliamentary authority for setting public debt limits and provisions for giving state \nguarantees. The Treasury Law was passed in 2004, authorizing the creation of a Treasury. The \nmain tasks provided for by the law include (i) control and management of the state budget cash \nresources, (ii) registration of contracts of budget organizations, (iii) accounting of all government \ntransactions, (iv) servicing of public debt, and (v) execution of national government guarantees. \nThe Treasury  Law  also  authorized  creation  of  TSA  at  CBU  to  hold  all  government  cash \nresources. During  subsequent  years,  the  Government has recognized the need for  further \nimprovements in these laws and is committed to refining them, in particular by (i) harmonizing \nthe BSL and Treasury Law on budget execution; (ii) providing for parliamentary appropriation of \nthe state budget, and progressive provision for budget organization extra-budgetary funds; (iii) \nprogressively improving disclosure of the state budget and budget organization extra-budgetary \nfunds; (iv) eventually producing annual accounts, audited by independent external auditors; and \n(v) certifying and submitting reports to the parliament, and the publication of these reports. \n \n22.  Budget Preparation. A major step has been undertaken to improve the quality of the \nbudget by preparing a  3-year MTFF in accordance with the essence of  the interim Welfare \nImprovement Strategy and Program. Starting with 2005, a rolling MTFF has been prepared, \nestablishing  targets  for  revenues  and  expenditures  for  the  subsequent  3  years.  This  is \nconsistent with medium-term projections  for GDP, ceilings for the budget deficit and public \nborrowing, as well as with other macroeconomic parameters. A working group consisting of \nrepresentatives of MOF, the Ministry of Economy (MOE), and CBU has developed projections of ", "5 \n \nmain macroeconomic parameters, revenues, and expenditures for the state budget, and basic \ndirections  for  budgetary  policy  for  2005\u201307,  thus  laying  the  foundation  for  an  MTBF  for \nexpenditure consistent with the MTFF. As part of the reform process, sector expenditure ceilings \nwere set for the first time in the 2005 budget. \n  \n23.  Work has also begun to formulate the budget on the basis of programs and policy \nobjectives rather than input norms. This is being done by the introduction of an experimental \nprogram budgeting process in selected ministries, including  the Ministry of  Education. This \nbottom-up approach will complement the top-down MTFF reform. \n \n24.  With external assistance, considerable work has been done in  developing a revised \nbudget classification system. The revised classification is in line with best international practices \nas  laid  down  in  the  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  (IMF\u2019s)  Government  Finance  Statistics \nManual (GFSM 2001). \n \n25.  It  will  take  some  years  before  this  fundamental  change  in  the  mode  of  budget \npreparation  becomes  comprehensive  and  systemized.  The  MTFF  process,  including  the \nprocess of setting sector expenditure ceilings, is still in the early stages of development and will \nrequire considerable  further  enhancement  using sound economic data  before it  can  meet \naccepted international standards. Development of the MTBF on a rolling basis will also require \nsome  institutional  changes  and  capacity  building  of  relevant  institutions,  especially  line \nministries, in understanding and formulating sector strategic policies and investment programs. \n \n26.  Budget Execution. The Government established a central Treasury in MOF following \nthe passage of the Treasury Law in 2004. In April 2005, the Government began developing \ntreasury  procedures  for  ex-ante checking of the expenditures of  budget organizations  and \napplying commitment controls by preregistration of contracts in two pilot regions (Tashkent city \nand Samarkand oblast) and their associated districts. \n \n27.  By the end of  2006 the pilot  program had been extended to six other regions and \ndistricts. Implementation of the treasury system to the remaining regions and districts is set to \nbe completed by the end of 2007. Treasury offices have opened consolidated bank accounts, \nclosing down the many bank accounts held by  budget organizations for budget operations in \nthese  pilot  regions.  Treasury  operations  are  now  conducted  using  a  mix  of  manual  and \ninformation  technology  (IT)  systems  developed  in-house,  covering  limited  but  core \nfunctionalities. \n \n28.  In February 2007, the Government approved  the organizational structure and staffing \nplan for the central Treasury and treasury departments and branches in the oblasts and rayons,4 \nand in March 2007 appointed the Head of Treasury. \n \n29.  PFM Reform Strategy. Recognizing that the reform is a long-term and complex task, \nthe Government has begun to take a holistic, long-term view. In May 2007, MOF developed a \nPFM reform strategy for the period 2007\u20132018. As described in paras. 6-7, the strategy outlines \nan action plan for the next 12 years to develop a modern treasury system, implement a unified \nbudget and accounting system, and introduce an MTBF and program budgeting in selected \nsectors.  An  important  element  of  the  strategy  is  to  develop  a  GFMIS  which  will  enable \n                                                 \n4  Presidential Resolution No. PP-594 was issued on 28 February 2007 \u201cOn measures for further development of a \nsystem of treasury execution of the State Budget\u201d. \n ", "6   \n \nconsolidation of  the bank accounts of  all budget organizations under the TSA at CBU. The \nGFMIS will progressively cover all fiscal operations, including those of extra-budgetary funds, \nand  also  consolidate  the  accounting  and  reporting  functions  of  all  fiscal  operations.  The \ninitiatives  taken  by  the  Government  since  2000  have  established  a  sound  basis  for \nadvancement of PFM reform and provided a good opportunity for ADB to support the reform.  \n \n3.  ADB Strategy \n30.  The Board endorsed ADB\u2019s CSP for Uzbekistan (2006\u20132010) in March 2006,5 calling for \ncontinued support for the country\u2019s transition toward a marked-based economy. The CSP seeks \nto be increase ADB\u2019s results orientation and proposes to focus ADB\u2019s operations on four priority \nareas: (i) acceleration of rural development, (ii) private sector development, (iii) promotion of \nregional cooperation, and (iv) improvement of human capital and the quality of basic education. \nIn addition, the CSP attaches great importance to good governance in all ADB\u2019s operations in \nthe country.  \n \n31.  The proposed Project is in line with the  essence of the CSP to support the country\u2019s \ntransition  to  a  market-based  economy  and  promote  good  governance  by  improving \ntransparency and accountability in budget management.  Although the proposed Project does \nnot fall into any of the four CSP priority areas, on a broader level it will help the country manage \nits  public  resources  more  effectively.  This  will  have  positive  implications  for  all  public \ninvestments, including those supported by ADB. The proposed Project will also provide a good \nfoundation for future dialogue and cooperation between the authorities and ADB in the area of \nPFM reform over the next 10\u201312 years, and for considering follow-up operations to continue \nsupporting the reform, depending on its progress and the country\u2019s needs.  \n \n4.  External Assistance \n32.  Since the launch of the PFM reform initiative, the Government has received assistance \nfrom a number of multilateral and bilateral agencies. The French Treasury and French Ministry \nof Economy, Finance and Industry established an ongoing technical assistance program in \n2001, involving an annual internship at the French Treasury, missions to Uzbekistan and a \nstudy tour to France. The United States Treasury provided a resident budget advisor to assist in \nthe preparation of the revised budget classification in 2003. In addition to sending frequent PFM \nconsultation missions, IMF has fielded a resident treasury advisor in Uzbekistan for most of the \ntime since 2003. The Islamic Development Bank has committed to support the training  with \nrespect to budget execution and treasury operations. The World Bank carried out a study on the \npublic expenditure review in 2003, and subsequently worked on  the preparation of  a loan \nproject.6 The Government of Japan provided grant funding for the TA project carried out by the \nWorld Bank in 2005 and by IMF since 2003. \n \n33.  The World Bank recently approved a grant-financed project that aims to improve the \ncountry\u2019s capacity in internal and external auditing. The implementation of this project started in \nApril  2007  and  is  expected  to  take  about  10  months  to  complete.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has recently begun implementing a 3-year project to assist \nthe Government in tax reforms, further development of an MTBF and pilot program budgeting. \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Uzbekistan 2006\u20142010. Manila. \n6  The World Bank provided significant support to the PFM reform and has continued its support in the area of \ninternal and external audit. At present, the World Bank\u2019s interim strategy, adopted in mid-2006, focuses its \nassistance on provision of advisory services and selected lending in social sectors. ", "7 \n \n \n34.  The European Union\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent \nStates (TACIS) program began funding technical assistance in 2002, and the work is ongoing. It \nhas provided (i) budget advisers to assist with the development of the MTFF and introductory \nwork on an MTBF and pilot program budgeting, (ii) treasury and human resources management \nadvisers  on  the  functional  and  institutional  aspects  of  the  treasury  system,  and  (iii)  a \ncommitment to funding the development of a treasury training facility. Most of the TACIS\u2019s \nongoing assistance is expected to be complete by the end of 2007. In addition, the TACIS is \ndiscussing with the Government  a possible future assistance program, mainly in  building the \ncountry\u2019s capacity in PFM reform implementation. At this stage, the results of discussions are \nunclear.  \n \n35.  The need for a TA project remains large given the complex nature of the PFM reform \nand the time required for implementation. In the short term, the need to  improve the country\u2019s \ncapacity  for  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised  budget  classification  is \nparticularly acute. During the preparation of the Project, ADB worked closely with IMF\u2019s resident \nadvisor, and collaborated with TACIS and  other agencies. Major external assistance to the \nsector is detailed in Appendix 4. \n \n5.  Lessons \n36.  Studies by ADB, previous ADB projects, and World Bank treasury projects  in other \ncountries highlighted the following  lessons, which were  considered during the design of  the \nproposed Project. \n \n(i)  Government commitment to ownership of PFM reform. The Government is \ncommitted to PFM reform; as noted earlier, it initiated the reform process in 2000. \nSince then the reform has advanced steadily with external assistance and its own \ninitiatives. The Presidential Resolution issued in February 2007, and the PFM \nreform strategy prepared by MOF in May 2007, have indicated the Government\u2019s \ncontinued strong commitment to the reform.  \n \n(ii)  Clear MOF ownership of the project design. The World Bank\u2019s experience of \ntreasury reforms in the Central Asia region  indicates the importance of careful \nproject preparation that ensures clear understanding and ownership of the final \nproject design by the implementing agency. During the project preparation, ADB \nmissions discussed various aspects of the Project and reached an agreement \nwith  MOF  on  its  objective,  scope  and  implementation  arrangements.  MOF \nworked  intensively  to  form  its  own  views  on  the  output  of  the  Project  and \nassociated critical milestones and performance indicators.  \n \n(iii)  Complementary TA to support the required capacity building. Previous ADB \nprojects indicate the need to ensure sufficient TA resources  are available for \ncapacity  building  because  of  the  complexity  and  iterative  nature  of  reform \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s special studies on its public expenditure management TA \nprojects for selected countries and TA projects for Kazakhstan and  the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, both carried out by the Operations Evaluation Department, indicated \nthat (a) capacity building is a long-term task and needs long-term TA, and (b) TA \nprojects should be designed with considerable understanding of the existing local \ncapacity, gaps, and constraints to ensure it takes into account the context rather \n ", "8   \n \nthan addresses the issues separately and ineffectively. Partly based on these \nlessons, complementary TA is included as an integral part of the Project. The TA \nwill be implemented within 2 years and will focus on addressing identified gaps \nand immediate needs  in budget preparation and execution using the revised \nbudget classification. While the TA does not intend, and will not be able, to meet \nall  the  capacity-building  requirements,  it  is  designed  to  complement  other \nongoing TA projects supported by other multilateral and bilateral agencies. It is \nalso designed to leave plenty of room for future possible assistance by other \ndevelopment  partners.  If  necessary,  ADB  can  consider  providing  additional \ncapacity-building support from its future operation program, as it will continue to \nconsult with authorities on progress in PFM reform implementation.       \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n37.  The project impact will be  improved planning and utilization of  public resources. The \nproject outcome will be improved effectiveness, efficiency, transparency, and accountability of \nbudget execution processes. The project impact and outcome will be monitored and measured \nmainly by the performance indicators as described earlier (paras. 9\u201310) and in the design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Components \n38.  Project outputs will comprise (i) establishment of a modern Treasury with a nationwide \nnetwork  of  treasury  offices  servicing  budget  organizations  of  national  and  subnational \ngovernments and revenue collection agencies, and development of a functioning GFMIS to \nfacilitate treasury operations;  (ii) consolidated and streamlined  treasury banking operations \nunder the established TSA; (iii) creation of a central accounting system using a unified COA in \nline with  the revised budget classification, the GFSM 2001 and IPSAS; (iv) a refined legal \nframework; and (v) application of the revised budget classification to the budget preparation and \nexecution with improved pilot program budgeting in selected sectors. \n \n39.  The Project will have three components: (i) establishment of a nationwide institutional \nnetwork of treasury offices and support for  capacity building;  (ii)  modernization  of  treasury \noperations; and (iii) project management, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n1.  Establishment of a  Nationwide Institutional Network  of Treasury Offices \nand Support for Capacity Building  \n40.  This component will provide assistance for the establishment of a nationwide institutional \nnetwork of treasury offices and associated capacity building in areas where gaps  have been \nidentified and the needs are acute.  In particular, the capacity building will include support to \nbuild  MOF\u2019s  capacity  in  the  maintenance  of  the  GFMIS  and  management  of  associated \ndatabases. \n \n41.  This component will include  two subcomponents, the first  being the  refurbishment of \ntreasury offices. These treasury offices at regional and district levels will be established prior to \nthe introduction of the GFMIS. The Government will finance the refurbishment in two phases, ", "9 \n \nwith $5.8 million during 2008 and $4.2 million during 2009, out of its own resources  and in \naccordance with its procurement procedures. \n \n42.  The second subcomponent will provide specialized training and certification for about 10 \nIT specialists from MOF in the GFMIS maintenance and associated database management. The \ntraining aspects will include (i) database administration, (ii)  operational systems engineering, \nand (iii) network technology engineering.  This training  will be provided by a specialized IT \ncertification company  for the following reasons: (i)  the training will be completed  before the \nselection of the GFMIS vendor7 to build the capacity of treasury staff in the transition to a new \ntreasury system and to coordinate with the GFMIS vendor during the software design and \ndevelopment phase, and (ii) there is a risk that the GFMIS vendor may not be able to provide \ntraining on all aspects required by MOF. The GFMIS vendor will be responsible for providing \nhands-on training for GFMIS functions, operation and maintenance. Therefore, the IT training \nand certification will be provided during the first year of project implementation in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), under a \ncontract between the PMO and an authorized IT certification company engaged on the basis of \nconsultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n2.  Modernization of Treasury Operations \n43.  This component will comprise development and implementation of a GFMIS. The GFMIS \nwill include six procurement packages, outlined below. Treasury functions, GFMIS functionality \nand technical requirements are available on request as a supplementary appendix.  \n \n44.  Package 1: Development and implementation of GFMIS software. This includes the \nfollowing elements: (i) supply of an integrated software package; (ii) setting the parameters of \nthe package according to MOF\u2019s specific requirements; (iii) development of integration modules \nfor  data  exchange  with  other  organizations,  including  as  CBU,  commercial  banks,  State \nTaxation Committee and State Customs Committee; (iv) development of user documentation \nand training modules in local languages; (v) installation, testing and deployment of the GFMIS in \nall treasury locations; (vi) training of  treasury staff in use of the GFMIS; and (vii) technical \ntraining of MOF and treasury IT staff to enable them to support the GFMIS. Procurement of this \npackage will commence as soon as possible after loan effectiveness. \n \n45.  Package 2: Supply of Main Servers. This procurement covers the supply, installation, \ncommissioning and support of the main server hardware and data storage equipment required \nto operate the GFMIS application in the main treasury computer center in Tashkent, plus the \nsupply of a set of equipment in a back-up computer center. These sites will be linked by high- \nspeed data lines and connected to the full treasury network. \n \n46.  As the technical specifications of these items will be dependent on the design and \nspecification of the GFMIS software to be procured in package 1, the  bidding documents for \npackage 2 will be finalized in consultation with the contractor for package 1. It will be important \nto gain contractual assurance from vendors that all elements (both software and hardware) of \nthe GFMIS  will  meet  the  performance  requirements  of  the  Project.  The  contracts for both \npackage 1 and package 2 will take this into consideration.  \n \n                                                 \n7  The GFMIS vendor is expected to be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s two-stage: two-envelope procedure at the \nend of the first year of project implementation. \n ", "10   \n \n47.  Package 3: Supply of Computers and Networking Equipment for Treasury Offices. \nThe establishment of treasury offices throughout Uzbekistan is proceeding rapidly and there is \nan urgent  need  to  procure  IT  equipment  at  an  early  stage  of  treasury  development. This \npackage covers the procurement of 580 computers, printers, related local servers and electronic \nsecurity facilities for these offices. These items will be used initially for standard office functions \nand  to  access  MOF\u2019s  interim  \u201cTreasury  One\u201d  software  system,  and  will  subsequently  be \navailable for use with the GFMIS.  \n \n48.  Package 4: Further Computers and Networking Equipment for Treasury Offices. \nUnder this package a further 1,048  computers (including uninterruptible power supplies and \noffice software) will be procured to fully equip oblast and rayon level treasury offices by the time \npiloting of the GFMIS application is ready to proceed. \n \n49.  Package 5: Supply of Telecommunication Networking Equipment. This procurement \npackage covers the networking equipment (including routers, firewalls, and internet telephony \ndevices) required to interconnect all treasury locations. \n \n50.  Package 6: Local Support Systems. This procurement package covers supply and \ninstallation of cabling, local area network switches, telecommunications cabling, uninterruptible \npower supplies, fiber-optic connections, alarm and monitoring systems, and fire detection and \nsuppression equipment. \n \n51.  Procurement of these six  packages will be financed by  the  ADB loan  and  will  be \nprocured through international competitive bidding (ICB).  \n \n3.  Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n52.  This component will comprise establishment of a PMO under MOF to manage day-to-\nday project  operations. MOF will appoint  (i) a full-time  project  manager; (ii)  specialists  in \nfinancial management, procurement, treasury and IT; and (iii) support staff with experience and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. The PMO will work in close cooperation with MOF, treasury, \nand its offices at central and local levels. \n \nC.  Project Investment Plan \n53.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $37.36 million. The cost estimates include \n$3.95  million  for  taxes  and  duties,  $1.28  million for physical and price contingencies, and \nestimated financing charges during implementation (comprising interest during implementation \nand a commitment charge) of $2.61 million.

Financing Plan  \n54.  The Government  has requested a loan of $20.70 million from  ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank-\noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35%  per  annum  on \nundisbursed loan amount,  and such other terms and conditions  set forth  in the draft loan \nagreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the bases of these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. \nThe requested level of financing will comprise 55% of the total project cost. The Government will \ncontribute  $16.66  million  toward  the  project  cost,  including  $10  million  for  financing \nrefurbishment  of  treasury  offices  nationwide,  $2.61  million  for  financing  charges  during \nimplementation and $3.95 million in taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n \n55.  MOF will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project. The  Deputy Finance Minister \n(who also is the Head of Treasury) will act as the project director and will oversee overall project \nimplementation. The PMO, headed by a full-time project manager nominated by MOF, will \nmanage  daily  project  activities.  The  PMO  will  comprise  full-time  financial  management, \nprocurement, treasury,  and accounting  specialists.  All  PMO  staff  will  have  experience  and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. The PMO will regularly report to the  Head of Treasury and \nADB. A project steering committee (PSC), comprising senior staff of MOF, CBU, MOE, Ministry \nof Foreign Economic Relations, Investment and Trade, State Tax Committee, State Customs \nCommittee,  and  other  government  agencies  will  be  formed  to  provide  policy  guidance  in \nimplementing the project and monitoring the project impact.  The PSC will be formed prior to \nloan effectiveness. The management organization chart is given in Appendix 6. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n56.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years. Project activities will include \nthe  selection  of  a  vendor  for  development  and  installation  of  the  GFMIS,  procurement  of \nhardware  and  networking  equipment,  and  development  and  implementation  of  a  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system. The training and capacity-building component \nwill be implemented in line with the progress in development and implementation of the GFMIS. \nThe project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n57.  Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Before loan negotiations, the Borrower will furnish for \nADB approval a project procurement plan. The Government shall implement the procurement \nplan as approved by ADB, and shall update the procurement plan annually, or as needed. ADB \nwill disclose the plan and its updates to the public after the approval of related financing. Major \ncontracts for IT software and equipment costing $0.5 million equivalent or more will be awarded \nthrough ICB. Shopping procedure will be used for contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or \nless. For the procurement of items below $10,000, MOF may purchase the items directly from \nthe supplier. In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable.  \n \n58.  All  goods  and  services  financed  by  the  loan  shall  be  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries. In addition, where the value of goods financed by the loan exceeds $1 million, a \npreshipment  certificate  from  a  reputable  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  may be required. The \nawarding of all contracts and substantial contract variations will be subject to prior approval by \nADB. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 8.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n59.  About 10 IT specialists from MOF will be trained in the following areas: (i) database \nadministration, (ii) operational systems engineering, and (iii) network technology engineering. \nThe training and certification will be provided during the first year of project implementation in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to ", "13 \n \ntime), under a contract between the PMO and an authorized IT certification company engaged \non the basis of consultant\u2019s qualifications selection method.  \n \n60.  An international IT and procurement consultant will assist the PMO in conducting ICB \nprocurements  of  the  various  GFMIS  components,  in  particular  the  development  and \nimplementation  of  software  (procurement  package  1).  MOF  will  engage  an  international \nconsultant in accordance with ADB procedures for recruiting individual consultants. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultant are given in Appendix 9. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n61.  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  For  consulting  services  and  equipment \ncontracts awarded following ICB procedures, loan funds will be disbursed using direct payment. \nFor contracts awarded on the basis of  shopping, direct contracting, and small operational \nexpenditures of the  PMO, statement of expenditure and imprest account procedures will be \nused. An imprest account will be established in a bank in Uzbekistan acceptable to ADB, for \nexclusive use of the Project.  The initial and total amounts of advance are not to exceed  the \nestimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest account \nfor  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified \ndocumentation,  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  and \nliquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  with  individual \ncontracts of $100,000 or less. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n62.  MOF will maintain separate project accounts and financial statements, in accordance \nwith the provisions of the Loan Agreement and  ADB Guidelines8 and will have them audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. During project implementation, within 6 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year, MOF will submit to ADB certified copies of the annual \naudited project accounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, which will \ninclude a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures, \nand management letter, all in English. MOF has been advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  and  the  suspension  of \ndisbursements of the ADB loan in case of noncompliance.  \n \n63.  MOF, through the PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB, indicating \nprogress made, problems encountered, and steps taken to remedy the problems, a program of \nactivities, and expected progress during the remaining implementation period. The reports will \nincorporate the project performance monitoring data and all relevant financial data.  MOF will \nalso provide reports and information relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. \nWithin 3 months after project completion, MOF will submit to ADB a project completion report \ndetailing information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and accomplishment \nof the project objectives.  \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. \n ", "14   \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n64.  A  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  be \nestablished  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  A \nmonitoring and evaluation unit will be established under the PMO. The PMO  manager and \nfinancial  management  specialist  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  monitoring  project \nimplementation progress and will provide regular reports to MOF and ADB. The monitoring \nindicators in the project design and monitoring framework will form the core of the data required \nfor assessment. For periodic monitoring, key indicators will be confirmed at project inception by \nMOF, and baseline data will be incorporated into the system focusing on outcomes and outputs \nconsistent with existing international and local reporting standards, and the project framework. \nWithin 6 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO  will develop a  gender action plan and will \nensure its implementation in a timely manner over the project period. The  plan will ensure \neffective involvement of women in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project. \nGender-related indicators will be included in the project performance monitoring and evaluation \nsystem and reported to ADB twice a year. In addition, project implementation arrangements, \nincluding capacity-development activities, will be monitored during the annual country portfolio \nreview exercise. \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n65.  The Government and ADB will jointly review implementation of the Project at least once \na  year.  After  2  years  of  implementation,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  carry  out  a \nmidterm review of the Project to identify any problems or constraints encountered and assess \nthe need for modification of project scope, implementation, and financing arrangements. Project \nobjectives will be measured against the performance criteria agreed  by the Government and \nADB.  The  parameters  for  assessing  the  implementation  milestones  will  include  (i) \nimplementation  status,  (ii)  GFMIS  functionality  and  quality,  (iii)  physical  progress  and \ndisbursements  related  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iv)  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants, (v) achievement of the Project\u2019s development objectives, (vi) progress of policy \nreforms, and (vii) the need for any changes in the project scope to achieve project impact. On \ncompletion, the Project will be evaluated according to a schedule and terms of reference to be \nagreed upon by the Government and ADB.  \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n66.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Project shall  include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of MOF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. The Government shall undertake necessary \nmeasures  to  publicly  disclose  Project-related  procurement  actions  such  as  information  on \nadopted  bidding  procedures,  specifications  of  goods,  works  and  consulting  services, \nparticipating bidders, and awarding of contracts. \n ", "15 \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n67.  A grant TA project of up to $600,000 will be provided as an integral part of the Project, \nmainly to meet the immediate needs for capacity building in implementing the PFM reform.  \n68.  The impact of the TA project will be improved budget preparation and execution under a \nbudget classification system consistent with international best practices, and improved linkage \nbetween budgeting and  policy objectives and investment programs. The outcome  of the  TA \nproject will be strengthened capacity of the Government in budget preparation and execution \nusing the revised budget classification. The TA project is to address immediate capacity-building \nneeds and focus on the areas not covered by other donors either now or in the near future. \nWhile the TA project will aim to have a nationwide impact, its training program will pay special \nattention to strengthening the capacity of relevant staff from MOF\u2019s  Treasury, local  treasury \noffices, Budget Department, MOE, and line ministries selected for pilot program budgeting.  \n \n69.  The TA project will have two components: (i) support  for budget preparation, and (ii) \nsupport for budget execution through  treasury operations using the GFMIS. The TA project \noutputs will comprise (i) development of  user manuals on  budget preparation and  treasury \noperation under the revised budget classification; (ii) development of training modules and \nmaterials  in  budget  preparation  and  execution  using  the  revised  budget  classification; (iii) \ndevelopment of performance indicators for the education sector; and (iv) training of 17 staff from \nMOF Treasury, Budget Department, and Treasury Training Center on budget preparation and \nbudget execution based on the revised budget classification. \n \n70.  The TA project is estimated to cost $720,000. ADB will provide a grant of $600,000 from \nits TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of $120,000 through in-kind \ncontributions for office accommodation, logistical support, local travel, and counterpart staff.  \n \n71.  The TA project will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting in January \n2008. MOF will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA  project.  MOF  Budget  Department  will  be  the  main \ncounterpart for budget preparation activities while the Treasury will coordinate budget execution \nactivities. The TA project will require 24 person-months of international and 48 person-months \nof national consultants with the following expertise: (i) performance-based budget preparation, \nand (ii) budget execution through treasury operation. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB  procedures  for  recruiting individual consultants. \nRecruitment of consultants on an individual basis is justified on the following grounds: (i) there is \na clear distinction between the tasks of budget preparation consultants and budget execution \nconsultants, as their outputs can be achieved independently and will not require a team effort or \nfirm supervision;  and (ii) the specific nature of proposed consultancy inputs assumes good \nunderstanding of the treasury and budget execution functions and familiarity with  the local \nenvironment.  To  facilitate  the  work  of  national  consultants  and  communication  with  MOF \nTreasury and Budget Department, the international consultants will procure office equipment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon \ncompletion of the TA project this equipment will be passed to MOF. The consultants will interact \nclosely  with  staff  of  MOF,  Treasury,  the  PMO  for  the  loan  project,  as  well  as  with  the \ninternational donor community active in this area.  Detailed TA project description and cost \nestimates are in Appendix 10. \n \n ", "16   \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n72.  The main economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  indirect  and  will  be  reflected in  (i) \nimproved budget quality, (ii) budget execution efficiency and linkage between budgeting and \npolicy objectives as well as program outcomes, (iii) greater transparency and accountability in \nPFM underpinned by the established treasury institutional network and modern treasury system, \nand (iv) progress in the introduction of the MTBF and program budgeting. The direct economic \nbenefits of the Project are the savings derived from better cash management and thus reduced \ninterest payments. \n73.  The beneficiaries of the Project include (i) policy makers and institutions who, with the \nhelp of the modern treasury, will be able to make decisions and, if necessary, fiscal adjustments \nbased on the timely availability of better-classified information; (ii) stakeholders, including the \ngeneral public and parliament, who will be able to better assess and monitor the effect of public \nfinance management; and (iii) the general public, which will benefit from the provision of public \ngoods and services that are facilitated by improved payment and budget execution processes. \n \nB.  Involuntary Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environmental Assessment  \n74.  The Project is not expected to cause direct or indirect involuntary resettlements, nor will \nit  lead  to  any  issues  affecting  indigenous  people  as  no  project  activities  would  imply \nresettlement of people from their traditional habitations. It is anticipated that the proposed civil \nworks will not trigger  ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy.9 Based on the discussions with \nMOF, it was confirmed that all civil works related to the refurbishment of treasury offices and \ndevelopment of local area networking will be carried out in strict compliance with applicable \nlocal legislation and will be subject to environmental monitoring by an authorized environmental \nagency.  Thus,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  Project is  unlikely  to have  any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n \nC.  Risk Assessment  \n75.  The Government\u2019s continued commitment to, and ownership of, the PFM reform process \nwill be crucial to the Project\u2019s success, and to the achievement of the intended outcome and \nimpact. This is especially true with further advancement of the reforms in MTBF and program \nbudgeting. It is recognized that  this is a long-term, complex task and  a sometimes iterative \nprocess.  It  will  require  institutional  changes  and  capacity  building  of  relevant  institutions, \nespecially  in  formulation  of  sector  policies  and  development  of  performance  indicators  to \nmeasure and monitor the effect of the reform. Currently the Government is receiving assistance \nin this area from  UNDP  and  TACIS.  As yet it is unclear  whether this  assistance  will  be \nadequate, as new needs may evolve. In any case, this will be one of the main areas for future \ndialogue  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Depending  on  the  country\u2019s  needs  and  the \nimplementation of other development-partner programs in capacity building, ADB will design its \nfuture program in this area accordingly. \n  \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Manila. ", "17 \n \n76.  Another  risk  is  that  staff  assigned  to  the  newly  established  treasury offices  will  be  \ninadequately skilled, and that the Government will not be able to retain trained staff. To mitigate \nthese risks, a targeted training program is planned. It will be carefully sequenced in line with \nprogress in the development and implementation of the GFMIS, and will include provisions that \nwill help prevent the loss of key trained staff.  \n \n77.  Frequent turnover of PMO staff is a potential risk. ADB will work with the Government to \nminimize staff turnover in the PMO and ensure the PMO is equipped with competent, full-time \nstaff. \n \n78.  Effective coordination with development partners will be important to meet the country\u2019s \nlong-term needs for capacity building. Such coordination during the project preparation stage \nhas been very good, and ADB will maintain close cooperation. The fact that ADB\u2019s Uzbekistan \nresident mission is leading the project preparation and implementation will help the coordination.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  To ensure the achievement of the intended impact and outcome, the following specific \nassurances will be reflected in the loan agreements.  \n \n1.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n(i)  The Government will initiate actions to improve the BSL and Treasury Law and \nthe MOF will prepare draft amendments by January 2008 for review by all other \ngovernment agencies.  \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  implementing  rules  and \nregulations  on  budget  preparation  and  execution  are  adopted  or  revised  in \ncompliance with the BSL and Treasury Law or their successor law(s) prior to \nimplementation of the revised budget classification and new COA. \n \n2.  Institutional Capacity \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that a nationwide network of treasury offices under \ndirect subordination of MOF is established by January 2008. \n \n3.  Revised Budget Classification \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the revised budget classification based on the \nGFSM 2001 classification structure is approved during 2007. \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all staff in budget organizations and MOF who \nare  engaged  in  budget  preparation  have  completed  training  on  the  revised \nbudget classification during 2008. \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that all staff in budget organizations and MOF who \nare engaged in budget execution have completed training on the revised budget \nclassification and unified COA during 2008. \n ", "18   \n \n \n \n(iv)  The Government will endeavor to introduce the new budget classification by \nJanuary 2009 but in any case prior to full implementation of the GFMIS.  \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the unified  COA (consistent with the revised \nbudget classification and IPSAS) that has been approved by MOF and registered \nby the Ministry of Justice will be included in the bidding documents for the GFMIS \nand will ensure that an instruction on accounting entries using the COA will be \napproved by January 2008. \n \n4.  Budget Coverage \n \n(i)  The Government will take necessary steps to progressively cover and include \nextra-budgetary revenues  and  expenditures  of  all  budgetary  organizations  in \npreparing and reporting the budget. \n \n(ii)  By not later than January 2009, the Government will establish an interministerial \ntaskforce comprising representatives of MOF, MOE and other relevant agencies \nwith  a  mandate  to  review  and  develop  appropriate  business  processes  for \nreporting expenditures on externally financed investment projects to MOF for \ntheir integration into budget and treasury accounting. \n \n(iii)  The Government shall ensure that its Cabinet of Ministers undertakes necessary \nmeasures  so  that  parliamentary  appropriation  progressively  covers  extra-\nbudgetary funds of budget organizations. \n \n5.  Banking Operations \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the Treasury bank account for the Republican \nbudget  established  in  March  2007,  will  cover  all  treasury  operations  of  the \nRepublican budget by January 2008, and that the TSA will be established by the \ntime the GFMIS is fully operational. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  extra-budgetary  accounts  of  budget \norganizations at commercial banks are progressively closed and are consolidated \nunder treasury bank accounts. \n \n6.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that none of the project components, activities or \ncivil works will entail any land acquisition, conversion, donation or restrictions of \naccess that will trigger ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n80.  As a condition for loan disbursement, the Government will issue a government resolution \nestablishing the PSC (as referred to in para. 55) and the PMO, and the latter will be staffed and \nbecome operational in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n ", "19 \n \nVII.

Macroeconomic Adjustments \n  \n1.  Macroeconomic management has improved significantly in recent years, as fiscal and \nmonetary policies  have been tightened, a zero net-external-borrowing policy introduced, and \nlending from the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan (CBU) to  the  budget  discontinued.  This  has \nsupported  the  unification  of  exchange  rates  and  the  formal  introduction  of  convertibility  in \nOctober 2003, which has removed one of the main obstacles to private investment. There has \nalso been a policy of progressively hardening budget constraints for state enterprises, through \nmeasures such as the use of energy and utility tariff increases, mandatory prepayments for \npower and gas consumers, and stronger efforts to boost collection. As a result, the quasi fiscal \ndeficit in the energy sector has been significantly reduced, although tariff adjustments have also \nbegun to adversely affect lower-income groups, particularly in urban areas.  \n \n2.  By  2006,  Uzbekistan  had  achieved  significant  fiscal  improvement.  Government \nexpenditure had been reduced from  about 45% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998 to \nabout 32% in 2006, and fiscal deficits had been eliminated by 2006 after having reached 10% in \n1998-99.  \n \n3.  Consistent with tighter fiscal policy, real-exchange-rate devaluation in the period leading \nup to the unification of the exchange rates, and continued administrative restrictions against \nimports, the external balance has improved significantly over the past 3 years. The current \naccount moved from a position of small deficits in the late 1990s to a surplus of 19.5% of GDP \nin 2006, and reserves have risen since 2001  to reach about the equivalent of 12 months of \nimports in 2006. High prices for Uzbekistan\u2019s two key export commodities, cotton and gold, have \nsupported this turnaround, as have rising gas exports to the Russian Federation. Following real-\nexchange-rate depreciation over the period 2000\u20132002, the ratio of external debt to GDP has \ndeclined significantly. Provided that the current tight external borrowing policies are maintained, \nthe debt-to-GDP ratio should decline to about 24% by the end of the decade, and the debt-\nservice-to-exports ratio to about 10%. Nonetheless, the economic growth recorded in recent \nyears has not been sufficient to improve the economic welfare of much of the population with \nlow incomes.  \n \nB.   Public Finance Management \n \n4.  The authorities recognize that there are serious weaknesses in budget preparation and \nexecution in Uzbekistan. These are common to all countries that inherited their public finance \nmanagement systems from the former Soviet Union.  \n \n  1.  Budget Preparation \n \n5.  Lack of Medium-Term Perspectives and Weak Links with Policy Objectives: The \nGovernment has been conscious of the weaknesses in the preparation of annual budgets. Most \nfiscal decisions in Uzbekistan are taken within the tight time constraints of the annual budget \ncalendar. The  Ministry of Finance (MOF) receives budget requests from 13 ministries, more \nthan 180 independent agencies of the state budget as well as the 14 regions that consolidate \nthe  budget  request  of  213  rayons  (districts).  The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  indicates  areas  of \nparticular priority, such as education, at the beginning of the budget preparation process. MOF \nreviews the budget requests in terms of their consistency with current regulations, and applies \n \n \n ", "24          Appendix 2 \ncuts mainly to the fourth category of expenditure,10 which often leads to a lack of funds for \nmaintenance and current supplies. However, the available time and data do not give MOF the \nopportunity to undertake in-depth analysis of the links between proposed or existing economic \npolicies and the state budget scenarios.  \n \n6.  Until recently the budget has also suffered from lack of a medium-term perspective, such \nas the preparation of a macroeconomic framework that would project important macroeconomic \nvariables\u2014including GDP, balance of payments, inflation, and interest rates\u2014over a 3\u20135-year \nperiod.  Such  a  macroeconomic  framework  would  form  the  basis  for  more reliable revenue \nestimates. In combination with  the government\u2019s deficit target, the revenue estimates would \nimpose an overall spending limit and allow for the establishment of sector spending limits, and a \ncoherent and sustainable aggregate and sector expenditure policy. \n \n7.  For the top-down approach and sector spending limits to be meaningful and sustainable \nrather than arbitrary and transient,  they need to be combined with  a bottom-up exercise that \nproperly costs and evaluates expenditure programs and allocates scarce resources to those \nthat are most effective. Currently the budget entities prepare their budget requests on the basis \nof input norms rather than on clear policies and policy objectives linked to defined programs with \nperformance indicators.  \n \n8.  A major step has been taken to improve the quality of budget by preparing a  3-year \nmedium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) in accordance with the Interim Welfare Improvement \nStrategy  and  Program  (IWISP).  Starting  with  2005,  a  rolling  MTFF  has  been  prepared, \nestablishing targets for revenues and expenditures for the next 3 years, consistent with the \nmedium-term projections of GDP, ceilings for the budget deficit and public borrowing, as well as \nwith other macroeconomic parameters. A working group consisting of representatives of MOF, \nthe Ministry of Economy (MOE), and CBU has developed projections of main macroeconomic \nparameters,  revenues,  and  expenditures  of  the  state  budget,  and  basic  directions  of  the \nbudgetary policy for 2005\u20132007, laying the foundation for a  medium-term budget framework \n(MTBF) consistent with the MTFF. In the 2005 budget, sector expenditure ceilings were set for \nthe first time. Work has begun to formulate the budget on the basis of programs and policy \nobjectives rather than input norms by introducing an experimental program budgeting process in \nselected ministries. It will, however, take some years before this fundamental change in the \nmode of budget preparation becomes comprehensive and systemized.  \n \n9.  The greatest challenges for the preparation of an MTBF are to (i) develop institutional \nmechanisms to link policymaking to budgeting, (ii) enhance the capacity in the formulation of \neconomic policies, and (iii) improve the quality and reliability of the main economic data. The \nMTFF process, including the process of setting expenditure ceilings, is at an early stage of \ndevelopment. It will require considerable further enhancement  to meet accepted international \nstandards in medium-term budgeting. \n \n10.  Outdated Classification  Structure.  As  there  has  been  a  mixing  of  functional  and \neconomic categories in the classification, the budget has been prepared using a classification \nsystem  that  does  not  have  independent  functional  or  economic  analysis.  Accordingly,  the \nclassification is not in line with the international standard laid down in the International Monetary \nFund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001), thereby undermining the \ndevelopment of a public finance management (PFM) system that can be benchmarked against \ninternational best practices.  \n \n                                                 \n10  Total expenditure is classified into four major categories: (i) social sphere expenditure, (ii) expenditure on \neconomy, (iii) expenditure on state power and administration, and (iv) other expenditures. ", "Appendix 2         25 \n11.  With assistance from the United States Treasury, IMF, and the French Treasury, in the \nlast 3 years considerable work has been done to prepare a revised classification structure that \ncorresponds to the GFSM 2001. It is expected the revised budget classification will be approved \nby the end of 2007. \n \n12.  Budget  Coverage  not  Comprehensive.  A  relatively  high  proportion  of  general \ngovernment expenditure is not covered by the budget. As shown in the table below, there are \ncurrently 22 extra-budgetary funds not included in the budget, the first five of which account for \napproximately 26% of expenditure, with the pension fund alone accounting for 18% of total \nexpenditure in 2004.  \n \nList of Extra-Budgetary Funds \n \n1.  Pension Fund \n2.  State Unemployment Fund \n3.  Special State Assets Account \n4.  Republic Road Fund \n5.  Fund for Reconstruction and Development \n6.

Regulation of Prices \n21. Special Energy Fund \n22. Rehabilitation Fund \nSource: Ministry of Finance of Uzbekistan  \n \n13.  Most budget organizations are allowed to supplement their budget revenues by raising \nadditional revenues and retaining  them in extra-budgetary funds. It has been estimated that \nthese  extra-budgetary-fund  expenditures  correspond  in  total  to  10%\u201315%  of  budgeted \nexpenditure. In addition, capital and current expenditure financed by external loans or grants is \ncurrently not included in the budget. \n \n14.  As a result, the budget is fragmented, and integrated policy decision making, budget \npreparation and budget execution are undermined. The authorities recognize this problem and \nare committed to integrating the budgetary system as a fundamental component of improving \nthe  quality  of  the  public  finance  management  system,  and  hence  its  effectiveness  and \nefficiency.  \n \n15.  Lack of Transparency. Budget documentation, including detailed budget and line-item \nexpenditures, as well as planned policies regarding revenue and expenditures, has not been \nmade public until recently. The authorities have begun publishing summaries of the approved \n \n \n ", "26          Appendix 2 \nbudgets since 2004 and adopting a more detailed breakdown  of budget execution. They are \ncommitted to extending the level of detail of budget data to be published in future. \n \n16.  Institutional Weaknesses Impeding Budget Preparation Reform. The lead agency \nfor the investment budget, responsible for the Public Investment Program (PIP), is not MOF but \nMOE. Although MOF officials are involved in the formulation of the PIP and all projects are \nformally subject to a process of appraisal, they are not evaluated together with other public \nresources being assigned to a particular sector, within the sector\u2019s budgetary envelope. In \naddition, key decisions in the PIP are taken outside the formal budget process (for example, a-\npriori decisions on the number of schools and hospitals to be constructed). There is minimal \ninvolvement and hence accountability of line ministries in investment budget preparation and \nexecution.  \n \n17.  The  budgetary  preparation  functions  of  MOF  are  distributed  across  a  number  of \ndepartments reporting to different  deputy  ministers,  who  are  also responsible for functions \nunrelated to budget preparation. Moreover, MOF does not have a separate department for \nmacroeconomic analysis and forecasting, which will be necessary for MOF to be able to both \ngive informed policy advice on fiscal policy and to form a basis for the development of the \nresource envelope for the budget. The authorities recognize these problems and are adopting a \ngradual approach to their resolution.  \n \n  2.  Budget Execution \n \n18.  There  are  thousands  of  bank  accounts  in  use  outside  MOF\u2019s  control,  resulting  in \nfragmentation  of  cash  resources  and  poor  payment  control.  Current  organizational \narrangements  make  effective  monitoring  of  budget  execution  impossible.  There  are \napproximately 50,000 budget organizations operating over 100,000 of their own bank accounts, \nmostly in commercial banks, for both budgetary and extra-budgetary funds. Line ministries have \nweak control over the budget organizations that operate in their areas of responsibility, and  \nMOF does not have a full inventory of these accounts. \n \n19.  There is a lack of segregation of duties between the release of the authority to spend \nand the release of cash to spending units, with cash being transferred to budget organizations \nby crediting their bank accounts. These procedures allow spending agencies to build up idle \ncash balances, thus increasing MOF's gross-borrowing requirement. \n \n20.  In principle, budget funds are released to budget organizations on the basis of monthly \nexpenditure plans prepared after the adoption of the budget, but to keep cash under control \nthese releases are not automatic and are  prioritized by MOF, which issues a certificate to \nauthorize them. Cash management is currently focused on the distribution of cash to settle \ndifferent categories of payables. Strenuous efforts are made to ensure that wages, salaries and \nsimilar payments that represent income to individuals are paid either on time or within a few \ndays  of  the  due  dates,  including  by  arranging  short-term  loans.  The  situation  has  been \naggravated by CBU\u2019s rationing of cash in the banking system. The result has been that although \nfunds  are  made  available  through  the  banking  system  to  budget  organizations,  these \norganizations are unable to make payments in cash to final recipients. The result has been that, \nparticularly  outside  Tashkent,  arrears  of  two  or  more  months  have  occurred  in  wage and \npension payments.  \n \n21.  Because of the multitude of bank accounts and the ways in which they are funded and \nused, there is no direct coordination of bank balances in order to optimize the application of the \naggregate cash available to MOF. The existence of budget organizations\u2019 extra-budgetary funds \n(with independent receipts, payments and bank accounts) exacerbates MOF\u2019s  difficulties in ", "Appendix 2         27 \ntrying  to  optimize  cash  management.  The  authorities  recognize  these  problems  and  are \ncommitted to introducing a comprehensive treasury single account (TSA) system for the general \ngovernment sector and systematic cash planning and management. \n \n22.  Weak and  Cumbersome Accounting and Reporting. Budget organizations, MOF\u2019s \nfinancial departments in  oblasts and  rayons, and line ministries financed directly from MOF \nmaintain  their  accounts  in  accordance  with  a  chart  of  accounts  (COA)  prescribed  by  the \ngovernment of the former Soviet Union in 1986. A separate COA is issued to account for such \nperiodic cash releases to line ministries during the budget execution process. The financial \ndepartments in oblasts (regions) and rayons (districts) use yet another COA to account for the \ncash releases made by them to the budget organizations under their jurisdiction. The CBU, its \nregional  branches,  and  accredited  commercial  banks  continue  to  record  and  report  on \ngovernment  cash  transactions  in  accordance  with  a  COA  that  captures  major  economic \ncategories of expenditure and tax revenues by types of taxes. Many of the accounting and \nreporting operations are performed manually, reducing their timeliness and accuracy.  \n \n23.  Because  there  is  no  uniform  COA  for  government  operations  at  different  levels  of \ngovernment, MOF is able to consolidate only the cash account of the central government on a \nregular basis. In order to be able to account for and report transactions, other flows, and stocks, \nbudget organizations have to reference other classification systems. This reduces the speed \nand  accuracy  of  their  accounting,  including  reconciliation.  The  authorities  recognize  these \nproblems  and  have  approved  a  unified  COA  to  be  used  until  the  new  GFMIS  allows \ncomprehensive and timely accounting and reporting.  \n  3.  State of Internal and External Audit \n \n24.  The Control and Revision Department in MOF and its territorial divisions in oblasts are \nresponsible for internal auditing. Its current role includes monitoring compliance with budgets \nand other financial legislation and regulation, in particular  (i) the timeliness and priority of \npayments, (ii) the targeted application of expenditures, and (iii) the observance of expenditure \nlimits. Modern internal audit process, with its focus on mitigating risks, has a much broader \nfocus than this.  \n \n25.  In  general,  international  internal  audit  standards  are  designed  to  complement \ninternational external audit standards. In Uzbekistan, the Chamber of Accounts was established \nas the supreme  audit institution in mid-2002 (revised in 2005), but there is no provision for \nadherence to international external auditing standards. The Chamber of Accounts reports to the \npresident and parliament, but it is not envisaged that its reports will be published. It currently \nhas a staff of about 20 people and it is expected that this will be increased to 60. Much of its \nwork is carried out  using staff of the Control and Revision Department and private auditing \ncompanies. Membership of the Chamber of Accounts board consists of 13 senior ministers and \nofficials, with only two members from the parliament. \n  \n26.  While steps are needed to strengthen internal audit functioning (starting with MOF) and \nintroduce international internal audit standards, there is also a need to enhance the role of the \nChamber of Accounts if it is to function as an effective external audit agency according to \ninternational benchmarks. Its institutional capacity needs to be substantially increased and its \nindependence from executive needs assured.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28          Appendix 2 \nC.  Public Finance Management Reform Strategy \n \n27.  The Government recognizes the problems arising from the fragmented nature of the \nbudget and has assured that these issues will be addressed under the proposed PFM reform \ninitiative. The PFM reform strategy  has been developed by MOF with inputs from  the Fiscal \nAffairs Department of IMF and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to comprehensively address \nthe modernization issues of budget preparation and budget execution. A central element of the \nreform is the plan to set up a modern treasury system to replace the current budget execution \nsystem, which is dependent on the transfer of resources through thousands of bank accounts. \n \n1.  Legal Framework \n \n28.  The Budget System Law, approved in December 2000, provides a basic legal framework \nfor fiscal management. It sets out the process of preparation of the annual budgets by the \nnational and subnational governments, their consolidation into a state budget, and a timetable \nfor submission of budget documents and adoption of uniform functional, organizational and \neconomic classification. It also lays down the parliamentary authority for setting public debt \nlimits  and  provisions  for  giving  state  guarantees.  Some  flexibility  is  also  provided  to  the \nexecutive for amending the budget appropriations during execution.  \n \n29.  In August 2004, the country passed a  law on treasury execution of the state budget \n(Treasury Law), aimed at creating a central Treasury in MOF to service national and subnational \ngovernment budget organizations. The main tasks of the  Treasury provided for by the law \ninclude (i) control and management of the cash resources of the state budget, (ii) registration of \ncontracts of  budget organizations, (iii) accounting for all government transactions,  (iv) the \nservicing of public debt, and (v) the execution of national government guarantees. The law also \nauthorized creation of a TSA at the central bank to hold all government cash resources. \n \n30.  There was also a decree issued in April 2005 which had the objective of strengthening \nthe organizational activity of the Chamber of Accounts. The chamber was established in 2002 \nfor external monitoring of execution of the  state budget and to report on the results to the \npresident and the two chambers of parliament (Oliy Majlis), thereby creating an external audit \ninstitution. However, the Chamber of Accounts comprises 13 senior ministers and government \nofficials with only  one member being drawn from each house of the parliament, and so has \nlimited institutional support. \n \n31.  Review of Statutory Framework. The Government recognizes the need for review of \nthe existing legislation on budget preparation, external  audit, and treasury operations in  the \ncontext of the reform dynamics. Amendments to ensure the following are under consideration: \n \n(i)  harmonization  of  the  Budget  System  Law  and  the  Treasury  Law on budget \nexecution; \n \n(ii)  provision for parliamentary appropriation of the state budget, and progressive \nprovision for budget organization extra-budgetary funds; \n \n(iii)  permission  for  MOF  to  reduce  the  appropriations  if  financial  exigencies  so \nrequire; \n \n(iv)  progressive  improvement  in  disclosure  of  the  state  budget  and  budget \norganization extra-budgetary funds; and \n ", "Appendix 2         29 \n(v)  eventual production of annual accounts and their audit by independent external \nauditors; certification and submission of reports to the parliament, and publication \nof the reports. \n \n  2.  Budget Preparation Reform \n \n32.  Budget Classification. The revised budget classification system based on the GFSM \n2001  has  been  prepared  with  external  technical  assistance.  The  training  needs  for  the \nintroduction  of  the  revised  budget  classification  need  to  be  met  after  development  of  an \nappropriate training program. The Government has agreed that this would be completed in time \nfor the 2009 budget.  \n \n33.  MTBF and Program Budgeting. A prepilot MTBF was used by MOF in 2005, assisting \nit to evaluate the fiscal policy implications and impact of new policies on expenditures. This is \nexpected to be extended to a full pilot in  the 2008 budget. This is predominantly a top-down \nexercise involving MOF and MOE to improve the sustainability of the annual budget and better \nintegrate capital and current expenditure budgeting. \n \n34.  At the same time it is also planned to introduce program budgeting in selected ministries \nby  developing  policy  objectives  and  priorities  with  some  modification  of  existing  budget \nclassification in the preparation of the 2008 budget. \n \n35.  Improved  Integration  of  the  Budget.  The  Government  has  also  assured  that an \ninterministerial committee to examine and finalize the business processes for integration of the \nexpenditures on PIP financed from external sources would be established before January 2009. \nIt would also take steps to bring within the parliamentary appropriation process all  budget \norganization extra-budgetary funds.  \n \n  3.  Development of Treasury Operations \n \n36.  Institutional Capacity Building. A Treasury has been established as a department of \nMOF. At the end of 2006 it had branches in eight oblasts and their districts, after successfully \ntesting the core functions of the treasury system at the beginning of 2006 in two major oblasts \n(including Tashkent city). The current main functions of the treasury branch offices comprise: \n \n(i)  closing down the bank accounts of the  budget organizations in their areas for \nbudget operations, bringing them under the consolidated treasury bank accounts \nand meeting the payment needs of the  budget organizations from the treasury \nbank accounts; \n \n(ii)  preregistering budget organizations\u2019 contracts for goods and services to ensure \navailability of funds; \n \n(iii)  ex-ante checking of payment requests from the budget organizations against the \nbudget allocation and registered contracts; and \n \n(iv)  primary  accounting  of  transactions  and  reporting  to  central  Treasury  for \nconsolidation and bank reconciliation. \n \n37.  By expanding the treasury network the Government has planned to extend the scope of \ntreasury  operations  to  all  oblasts  and  rayons  before  the  end  of  2007.  It  will  finance  the \nacquisition, renovation or construction of the premises for  treasury offices. The Government \n \n \n ", "30          Appendix 2 \nissued a Presidential Resolution in February 200711, which outlined the organizational structure \nand staffing plan for the treasury offices. Subsequently a Cabinet of Ministers resolution was \nissued which appointed a deputy minister of MOF to be the head of treasury.  \n \n38.  Currently MOF\u2019s financial departments in oblasts and rayons have some degree of dual \nsubordination to the local governments and MOF. The government has assured that the local \ntreasury offices will be brought under direct MOF control after the Treasury is fully established. \n \n  4.  Improvement of the Accounting System \n \n39.  As the treasury is established nationwide, the need for a robust accounting system to \ncapture  the  data  at  the  transaction  stage  becomes  a  priority.  The  current  accounting  and \ntreasury system depends on a mixture of manual and computer driven processes, and uses two \ndisparate IT systems developed for specific purposes such as preregistration of contracts and \npayment request verification and consolidation of accounting reports.  \n \n40.  A new unified COA has been developed and approved as part of the preparatory work \nfor the implementation of the GFMIS with external technical assistance. Owing to the constraints \nand limited functionality of the IT systems now used by MOF, the new united COA cannot yet be \nimplemented.  It will, however, be the backbone of a modern accounting system when the \nGFMIS is implemented. Meanwhile, it is important that the interim systems are modified to the \nextent possible to facilitate early implementation of the revised budget classification by January \n2009. \n \n41.  Apart  from  the  essential  program  modifications  needed  to  implement  the  revised \nclassification from 2009, the authorities intend to organize major training programs for budget \nand treasury staff prior to January 2009. This is a critical area and needs priority attention. \n \n  5.  Planning and Implementation of GFMIS \n  \n42.  This is the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s reform strategy. Without a GFMIS it will be \ndifficult to sustain the reforms in the budget preparation, treasury operations, and improved \nfiscal management and accounting already made, and to make further progress. Outputs of the \nproject for GFMIS implementation and the associated process reforms will be the following. \n \n(i)  Centralized support for nationwide  treasury operations servicing almost 50,000 \nbudget organizations of all levels of government (national and subnational). \n \n(ii)  Use  of  a  modern  accounting  system  with  a  uniform  COA  reflecting  revised \nbudget classification (GFSM 2001), but capturing all financial flows, including \nbudget  organization  extra-budgetary  funds  and  expenditure  financed  from \nexternal sources. Initially it will be on a cash basis, but will have the flexibility to \nallow  seamless  future  migration  to  accrual-based  international  accounting \nstandards.  \n \n(iii)  Release of budget appropriations according to financial plans and forward cash- \nflow forecasting to facilitate payment financing. \n \n(iv)  Improved  cash  management  due  to  consolidation  of  all  government  cash \nresources under a TSA at CBU and reduction in the cost of budget financing. \n \n                                                 \n11 Presidential Resolution No. PP-594 of 28 February 2007 \u201cOn measures for further development of a system of \ntreasury execution of the State Budget\u201d.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \n1.1   Purpose \nThe President of the Republic of Uzbekistan has during recent years directed the executive \nauthorities to undertake actions to design and execute a Public Financial Management (PFM) \nreform strategy.  \n \nThe purpose of this information document, which has been approved by the Minister of Finance, \nis to: \n \n\u2022  Summarize the strategy; \n \n\u2022  Identify the reform priorities and sequencing of reform measures in order to guide the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) in the execution of the strategy; and \n \n\u2022  Set out the PFM reform action plan.  \n \n1.2   Ultimate Objective \nThe ultimate objective of the PFM strategy is to improve control over the PFM system in the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan. Improved control is necessary to: \n \n\u2022  Allocate resources in accordance with the priorities and policies of the Government of \nUzbekistan; \n \n\u2022  Deliver services efficiently in terms of the use of resources; \n \n\u2022  Maintain aggregate fiscal discipline.  \n \n1.3   Intermediate Objective \nThe intermediate objective is to modernize key processes in the PFM system via the: \n \n\u2022  Establishment of a modern centralized treasury system;  \n \n\u2022  Introduction of a modern, comprehensive and unified budget and accounting system \nincluding a new budget classification and a new chart of accounts (COA); and \n \n\u2022  Introduction of a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and program budgeting.  \n \n1.4   Timeframe \nThe  strategy  envisages  reform  actions  until  2018.  This  is  the  currently  planned  date  for \ncompleting  the  phasing-in  of  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  (IPSAS). \nHowever, it is possible that the end date of 2018 will change, for example if the accounting \nstandards are phased in more quickly or slowly than currently envisaged, or if further reform \nmeasures are decided on.  \n \n ", "34          Appendix 3 \n1.5   Sequencing \nThe  new  Government  Financial  Management  Information  System  (GFMIS),  budget \nclassifications and COA are planned to become fully operational on January 1, 2011. On the \nsame date, the Treasury is planned to become fully operational. In order to prepare for this, a \nDepartment for Methodology and Introduction of Treasury Execution for the State Budget was \nestablished in the MOF. \n \nCompliance  with  IPSAS  and  the  Government  Finance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM)  2001  is \nplanned to be phased in until 2018. \n \nThe 2008 budget is planned to be prepared in the context of an MTBF and pilot program \nbudgeting.  \n \nThe 2009 and 2010 budgets are planned to be prepared on the basis of expanded pilot program \nbudgeting, with full program budgeting introduced from January 1, 2011.  \n \nThe new budget classifications are planned to be introduced at the latest from January 1, 2011, \nbut might be introduced earlier, from January 1, 2009 or January 1, 2010.  \n \nB.  CENTRALIZED TREASURY SYSTEM \n2.1  Establishment of Treasury \nThe Department for Methodology and Introduction of Treasury Execution for the State Budget \nwas established in May 2005 in order to introduce progressively the Treasury execution system \nfor the State Budget. Its operations now cover the whole country and it is planned to cover all \nbudgetary expenditures by December 31, 2007. The President\u2019s Resolution #594 of February \n28, 2007 established the MOF Treasury on the basis of this Department. \n  \n2.2   Benefits of Treasury Establishment  \nThe MOF plans to improve control over the PFM system via the establishment of the Treasury \nby: \n \n\u2022  Improved control over cash by consolidating government banking arrangements and \nintroducing systematic cash planning and management. Currently, budget organizations \nhave their own bank accounts in commercial banks, the MOF does not receive accurate \nand timely information on Government cash flows and balances, and therefore system-\nwide control over cash is loose;12 \n \n\u2022  Improved control over payments, ensuring that they conform to appropriations. Final \ncontrol over payments has been exercised by commercial banks and has been loose \nbecause  of  weak  institutional  relationships  (bank-client  relationship,  lack  of \naccountability of banks to the MOF) and technical infrastructure (broad budget economic \nclassification, paper-based information systems); \n \n                                                 \n12 It has been estimated that there are approximately 47,000 budget organizations in the Republic of Uzbekistan, at \ncentral, regional and local government levels, using 120,000 bank accounts. \n ", "Appendix 3          35 \n\u2022  Establishing control over commitments, e.g., before contracts for the supply of goods \nand services become valid.  This should make the expenditure process more orderly, \nincreasing compliance with budget expenditure appropriations and reducing expenditure \narrears. Hitherto, there has been no commitment control; \n \n\u2022  Improving information collection, synthesis and analysis, via a GFMIS that generates \nimmediate  information  on  budget  execution  and  other  general  government  financial \ntransactions.    \n \nIn turn, strengthened fiscal control should make: fiscal policies more stable and sustainable, \nwith attendant macroeconomic benefits; monetary policies more effective by making fiscal flows \nmore transparent; banking systems more effective by eliminating the budget execution role of \ncommercial  banks;  and  budgetary  policies  more  effective  by  improved  information  and \nstrengthened control over resources. \n \nThe Republic of Uzbekistan has in the past been successful in aggregate expenditure control, \nbut this has required immense effort which has been to the detriment of other PFM functions. \n \n2.3  Functions of Treasury \nWhen it is fully operational, the Treasury is planned to have four groups of functions: performing \ncertain central financial functions; developing and issuing standards; promulgating instructions; \nand preparing proposals for the MOF. In fulfilling its functions, the Treasury should endeavor to \nmeet international standards. \nThe planned central finance functions of the Treasury are to: \n\u2022  Accept,  record  and  fulfill  all  requests  for  payment  authorized  to  be  made  by  all \norganizations of the general government sector; \n\u2022  Accept, record and deposit all receipts authorized to be received by all organizations of \nthe general government sector; \n\u2022  Manage the banking relationships of the general government sector; \n\u2022  Manage  the  Soum-denominated  debt,  financial  assets,  contingent  liabilities  and \ncontingent assets13 of the general government sector within the framework of policies \ndetermined  by  statutory  instruments  enacted  by  the  Oliy  Majlis  and  regulatory \ninstruments promulgated by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers;   \n\u2022  Produce financial statements and management reports on the financial operations and \nfinancial position of the general government sector and its organizations,   including as \nprovided for in legislation and regulations; \n\u2022  Control other aspects of budget execution by: controlling the conformity of certificates of \npurpose and payment requests with budgetary authorities and with requirements of \nstatutory and regulatory instruments; cash planning, that is the preparation of payment \nand receipt forecast schedules; cash management; commitment control; and advising \n                                                 \n13 Foreign currency-denominated debt, financial assets, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not planned to \nbe managed by the Treasury in the foreseeable future. \n ", "36          Appendix 3 \nthe  MOF  of  potential  or  expected  divergences  in  the  course  of  the  financial  year \nbetween budgets as executed and budgets as approved, and of possible consequences \nof, and responses to, such divergences. \nThe planned functions of the Treasury in respect of issuing standards are to assist the MOF to \nissue standards in respect of the general government sector for accounting and internal audit. \nThe planned functions of the Treasury in respect of promulgating instructions are to assist the \nMOF to promulgate instructions in respect of the general government sector for: processing \npayments  and  receipts;  cash  planning;  cash  management;  accounting  for  and  otherwise \nrecording payments and receipts; accounting for and otherwise recording transactions other \nthan  payments  and  receipts,  including  other  economic  flows  and  stocks,  and  contingent \nliabilities and assets (guarantees and other); financial and management reporting; commitment \ncontrol; procedures in respect of the approval of transactions giving rise to contingent assets \nand liabilities (guarantees and other); internal control;  internal audit; and other aspects of \nbudget execution. \nThe planned functions of the Treasury in respect of advising the MOF are to provide advice on \nappropriate policies, relevant to the Treasury\u2019s functions listed above, to achieve the ultimate \nobjective of the PFM strategy. \n2.4   MOF Treasury \nThe pilot MOF Treasury is applying commitment and payment controls and cash management \nwith  limited  tailor-made  software.  Progressively,  the  coverage  of  the  different  types  of \nexpenditure is being expanded and budget organization bank accounts are being closed. By \nDecember 31, 2007, it is planned for all types of expenditure to be covered by the Treasury and \nall budget organization bank accounts used for budgetary expenditures to be closed. It is also \nplanned that all budgetary transactions from that date on until the implementation of the GFMIS \non  January  1,  2011  will  be  processed  via  one  Treasury  bank  account  for  each  budget \n(Republican, oblast or rayon). \n \n2.5  GFMIS \nIt is planned to procure a customized off-the-shelf GFMIS to enable the Treasury to fulfill its \nfunctions  efficiently.  The  procurement  process  is  planned  to  begin  in  late-2007,  with \nimplementation commencing in 2010 and the full operation by the Treasury of the GFMIS \ncommencing on January 1, 2011.  \n \n2.6  Treasury Single Account \nThe Treasury Single Account, to be located at the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU), is planned \nto  apply  to  the  whole  of  the  general  government  sector.  However,  in  order  to  effect  the \ndisbursement of notes to pay salaries etc, a separate Treasury bank account for each budget \nmay be necessary; at this stage, it is planned to maintain such cash disbursement accounts, but \nthis is subject to review and may change. \n \nThe Treasury bank account for the Republican budget was opened in March 2007. It is planned \nfor this bank account to  cover  all  Treasury  operations  of  the  Republican  budget  by  end-\nDecember 2007, and for the Treasury Single Account  to be established on January 1, 2011, \n ", "Appendix 3          37 \nwhen the GFMIS is fully operational. At this time, it is planned to close all budget organization \nbank accounts used for extra-budgetary expenditures. \n \nC.  ACCOUNTING REFORM \n3.1  Principles of New Accounting System \nThe MOF has decided that the efficiency of the accounting system should be maximized in \norder to be able to support improved control. To this end, the system is planned to be uniform \nthroughout  the  general  government  sector  and  to  comply  with  international  standards. \nAccordingly, it is planned to: promulgate new Uzbekistan public sector accounting standards in \nline with accrual basis IPSAS; comply with GFSM 2001; and undertake budget accounting on a \ncash basis reflecting the GFSM 2001 classification structure. To this end, a uniform COA for the \ngeneral government sector to enable accounting and reporting on these bases has been \ndesigned and promulgated. For technical efficiency reasons, the structure of the new COA has \nbeen based on the GFSM 2001 classification structure. \n \n3.2   Phasing \nThe new accounting system is planned to replace an existing system which is fragmented; parts \nof the system are on a cash basis and part is on an outdated accrual basis. The MOF currently \nplans to implement the new system broadly as follows: \n \n2009- 2012- 2016-\nPhase and Activities   2011 \n10  2015  2018 \nPhase  0:  Pre-GFMIS  (if  the  GFSM  2001  budget  classification  is   \nintroduced before the GFMIS implementation; otherwise in Phase 1) \n____ \n1.      Aggregate  budget  execution  reports  are  prepared  that  are  largely       \ncompliant with GFSM 2001 and Cash Basis IPSAS. \n\u2022  Phase 1: GFMIS Operational         \n2.    Accrual IPSAS and GFSM 2001 information is prepared and provided as   \n____     \nsupplementary disclosures. \n3.  Foreign currency gains and losses accounted for in accordance with   \n____     \nIPSAS 4. \n4.   The accrual IPSAS supplementary disclosures include segmental analyses   \n____     \n(i.e., republican, oblast, and rayon budget levels). \n5.   Non-exchange revenues (e.g., taxes) accounted for on modified accrual   \n____     \nbasis. \n\u2022  Phase 2: GFSM 2001 Compliance (Excluding Land Valuation)         \n6.     Indexation approach to revaluing assets is discontinued.      ____   \n7.   Contingent assets and liabilities are identified and disclosed for budget   \n  ____   \norganizations. \n8.    Employment-related  liabilities  (excluding  pensions)  are  valued  and   \n  ____   \ndisclosed. \n9.  Pension Fund liabilities are valued and disclosed in accordance with   \n  ____   \ninternational standards. \n10.   Heritage assets are valued and disclosed.      ____   \n\u2022  Phase 3: Full Compliance with Accrual Basis IPSAS         \n11.

Compliance with accrual basis IPSAS and GFSM 2001. Cash Basis IPSAS   \n    ____ \nfinancial reports discontinued. \n \nThe MOF plans to review this phasing in 2008. \n \n3.3  Benefits \nThe benefits of accounting reform can be summarized as: improved financial reporting of the \nGovernment and its entities, including a full picture of their financial position; information on the \ntotal  costs  of  the  Government\u2019s  programs  and  activities;  improved  assets  and  liabilities \nmanagement  and  performance  measurement;  reliable  measures  for  fiscal  policy; improved \nfinancial transparency; and an improved foundation for cost accounting systems in government \nentities and for the budget system of the Government and its entities. \n \nD.  BUDGET PREPARATION REFORM \n4.1  Budget Classifications \nThe MOF plans to introduce new GFSM 2001-based budget classifications at the latest from \nJanuary 1, 2011, together with the new GFMIS. These new classifications have been designed \nand reflected in the design of the new GFMIS. The MOF may introduce the new classifications \nearlier than January 1, 2011, on January 1, 2009 or January 1, 2010. \n \nThe  GFSM  2001-based  economic  classification  is  planned  to  be  used  for  appropriation \npurposes, as is the GFSM 2001-based functional classification until an independent program \nclassification is introduced after which the functional classification is planned to be used for \nreporting purposes only. A GFSM 2001-compliant classification of balances and transactions of \nfinancial assets and liabilities by sector is intended to be introduced for reporting purposes only \n \nA new fund classification is also planned to be introduced, to be used for appropriation and \ncontrol purposes.  \n \nThe GFMIS has been designed to incorporate an independent program  classification.  It  is \nplanned to be activated when program budgeting is fully introduced on January 1, 2011.  \n \nThese new classifications  will  be  necessary  to  fully  realize  the  planned  benefits  from  the \nintroduction of the new Treasury.  \n ", "Appendix 3          39 \n \n4.2  MTBF and Program Budgeting  \nA pre-pilot MTBF was used by the MOF in 2004, assisting it to identify the consequences of \nfiscal policy in future years and the impact of new policies on expenditure baselines. The MTBF \nprocess is planned to be extended in 2008 budget preparation into a full pilot. This is planned to \nbe initially predominantly a top-down exercise (the Medium-Term Financial Framework [MTFF]) \ninvolving the MOF and the Ministry of Economy (MOE) to ensure the sustainability of the annual \nbudget, better integration of capital and current  expenditure budgeting and to derive financial \nceilings for annual budget proposals. \n \nIt is also planned that line ministries will introduce the MTBF in 2008 budget preparation on the \nbasis of pilot programs, on a bottom-up basis. This will build on the pre-pilot, in the MOF and \nselected line ministries, to give policy objectives, priorities and results greater emphasis in \nbudget proposals and to de-emphasize the use of cost norms. It is not intended to introduce \nprogram budgeting fully until after the successful implementation of the full pilot and with the \nintroduction of the new Treasury system including the GFMIS, currently planned to be January \n1, 2011. \n \n4.3   Appropriation System   \nThe MOF plans to introduce appropriations of expenditure by the Oliy Majlis, on a cash basis, at \nthe time the new budget classifications are introduced. It is planned that appropriation by the \nOliy Majlis will cover the republican, oblast and rayon budgets as currently defined, plus the \nbudgets of State Targeted Funds (STFs) and the extra-budgetary funds of budget organizations \n(BO-EBFs). The MOF expects that Oliy Majlis appropriation will improve control of expenditure.  \n \nIt is planned that the appropriation of expenditure by the Oliy Majlis will be at more aggregated \nlevels  of  the  classifications,  and  that  these  appropriations  will  be  disaggregated  into  more \ndetailed budget allocations approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. \n \nIt is not planned to appropriate by programs until program budgeting is implemented fully. The \napplication of the appropriation system to STFs and BO-EBFs is planned to be progressive.  \n \n4.4  Inter-governmental Fiscal Relationships \nThe MOF plans to develop clearer legal and institutional distinctions between different levels of \ngovernment, basing revenue shares and transfers to regional and local governments on more \nstable and predictable criteria. The MOF expects that this would improve control. The MOF also \nexpects  that  the  introduction  of  program  budgeting  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  the \ndistribution of policy responsibilities, and hence on the distribution of expenditure responsibilities \nas between central and local government. Accordingly, the MOF plans to commence a review of \ninter-governmental fiscal relations once the  shape of the future program budgeting system \nbecomes clearer. \n \n4.5  Disclosure of Budget and Financial Information \nSince the 2003 budget execution report, the budget and budget execution reports have been \npublished on a summary basis.  Over the next decade, planned changes in the structure of the \nbudget  and  improvements  in  the  availability  of  budget  and  related  information  will  require \nfrequent fresh decisions to be made on the detail of the information to be disclosed to the Oliy \n ", "40          Appendix 3 \nMajlis and the public. The MOF plans to increase progressively the range and depth of budget, \nbudget execution and other information on public finances that is disclosed publicly. \n \nE.  STATUTORY FRAMEWORK \nThe MOF plans to  initiate amendments to the Budget System Law (BSL) in 2008 as set out \nbelow.  \n \n1.  Revocation of BSL provisions that conflict with the provisions of the Law On Treasury Execution of the \nState Budget \n \n2. Authorization for the MOF to promulgate, without further legislative approval, the following budget \nclassifications that will be used for appropriation as well as for disclosure purposes; these classifications \nwill comply with the prevailing international standard for the classification of Government finance statistics \n(currently GFSM 2001): an economic classification for revenue, expenditure, and assets and liabilities; a \nfunctional  classification  of  expense  (expenditure);  an  organizational  classification;  a  program \nclassification; a fund classification; and any other required classifications. \n \n3.  Definition  of  budget  and  associated  disclosure  requirements,  including  publication  of  the  annual \nbudget, budget execution reports and associated ex ante and ex post documents, in conformity with the \nrelevant provisions of the Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency of the IMF. The associated \ndocuments will include, but not be limited to: MTBF documents; financial statements; and disclosures \nrelating to operations within the general government sector and outside the budgetary sector (notably \nextra-budgetary funds of budget organizations). The format of the associated documents will conform in \nparticular with the prevailing international standard for the classification of government finance statistics \nand prevailing international public sector accounting standards. \n \n4. Definition of new budget preparation procedures conforming with the relevant provisions of the Code of \nGood Practices on Fiscal Transparency and providing for: the preparation and updating of an MTBF \ndocument; the preparation of an annual budget strategy document; budget submissions to be constrained \nby expenditure ceilings; the definition of budget submissions in terms of policies, objectives and results as \nwell as input costs; and systematic new and existing policy reviews by the Government. \n \n5. Definition of a parliamentary appropriation process that covers parliamentary submission, deliberation \nand approval, and incorporates: (i) the application of appropriation only to expenditures and not to \nrevenues; (ii) appropriation on a cash basis; (iii) the separation between the release of cash and the \nrelease  of  budgetary  authority  derived  from  parliamentary  appropriation;  (iv)  unused  appropriations \nlapsing at year-end; (v) the definition of appropriation according to the organizational, economic, fund and \nprogram (or functional) classifications via an annual budget law; (vi) the application of the appropriation \nsystem  to  the  republican,  oblast  and  rayon/city  budgets  (including  those  of  the  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan and Tashkent city) as currently defined, plus on a progressive basis the budgets of STFs \nand BO-EBFs, i.e., the general government sector; (vii) permission for Government entities to under-\nspend  appropriations  but  not  to  over-spend  appropriations  except  to  the  extent  and  in  the  manner \nspecifically  authorized  by  the  BSL;    (viii)  permission  for  the  Government  to  reduce  parliamentary \nappropriations of expenditure (other than of budget organization extra-budgetary funds) up to a certain \nlimit  (possibly10%)  in  aggregate  in  the  event  that  revenue  shortfalls  threatened  the  emergence  of \nexpenditure arrears; and (viii) permission for the Government to transfer up to a certain limit (possibly \n10%) of one parliamentary appropriation item to another. \n \nThe MOF also plans to initiate amendments to the Law  On Treasury Execution of the State \nBudget to take account of experience with the progressive introduction of the Treasury and to \nexamine the option of combining the BSL with the Law  On Treasury Execution of the State \nBudget into a single public finance statute. \n \n ", "Appendix 3          41 \nF.

Background \n \n1.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is in the process of establishing a modern treasury with a \nnationwide  network  of  treasury  offices  servicing  the  budget  organizations  of  national  and \nsubnational governments and revenue collection agencies.  \n \n2.  To  support  the  functions  of  the  treasury,  MOF  is  planning  to  implement  a \ncomprehensive,  computer-based  government  financial  management  information  system \n(GFMIS)  covering  the  functions  of  (i)  appropriations  management,  (ii)  commitments  and \npayments management, (iii) receipts management, (iv) cash planning and management, (v) \nbank management, (vi) financial assets (debt and fixed income) management, (vii) accounting, \nand (viii) analysis and reporting.

The two sites will be linked by high-speed \ndata lines and connected to the full  treasury network. These items have been \nincluded in a separate procurement package to reflect the importance of the \ncentral  servers  to  the  effective  development  and  operation  of  the  GFMIS. \nBecause the technical specifications of these items will be dependent on the \ndesign and specification of the GFMIS software to be procured under package 1, \nthe bidding documents for  package 2 will be finalized in consultation with the \ncontractor  for  package  1.  Procurement  of  package  2  will  commence  after \nfinalization of the contract for package 1. The advisor will need to pay particular \nattention to gaining contractual assurance from the contractors for both packages \nthat  all  elements  of  the  GFMIS  (both  software  and  hardware)  meet  the \nfunctionality and performance requirements of the Project.  \n \n(iii)  Package 3:  Supply of computers and  networking equipment for treasury \noffices.  This  package  covers  the  procurement  of  a  number  of  computers, \nprinters, related local servers and electronic security facilities for treasury offices \n ", "52          Appendix 9 \n \nprior to development of the GFMIS.

Background \n \n1.  The Government initiated public finance management (PFM) reform in 2000. Since then \nthe Government has undertaken a number of steps to advance the reform process. One of \nthese steps was the development of a PFM reform strategy for 2007\u20132018 by the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) in April 2007. The strategy outlines an action plan for the next 12 years to (i) \nestablish a functioning treasury system, (ii) adopt and implement a modern unified budget and \naccounting system, and (iii) introduce a medium-term budget framework (MTBF) and program \nbudget. \n \n2.  A central element of the PFM reform is to improve budget execution process significantly \nover the next 5 years. The strategy plans to set up a nationwide network of treasury offices with \na central treasury in MOF, local treasury departments at regional1 (oblast) level and branches at \ndistrict (rayon) level. These treasury offices will provide services to the budget organizations of \nboth  national  and  subnational  governments.  The  currently  fragmented  treasury  banking \noperations  will  be  consolidated  under  a  treasury  single  account  at  the  Central  Bank  of \nUzbekistan, supported by a computerized information system. \n \n3.  Some of the preparatory work is already underway. Since April 2005, pilot treasury \noperations with limited but core functionalities have started in Tashkent city and Samarkand \noblast and their associated district treasuries. These functionalities include procedures for ex-\nante checking of budget organization expenditures and application of commitment controls by \npreregistration of budget organization contracts. The pilot program extended to six other regions \nby the end of 2006, and there are plans to further cover the whole country. \n  \n4.  MOF  has  done  the  groundwork  for  development  of  an  integrated  IT  system  (the \ngovernment financial management information system [GFMIS]) for use by all treasury branch \noffices and the central treasury. The GFMIS will enhance the treasury functions, substantially \nchanging business processes. It will help to (i) streamline treasury banking and single\u2013account \noperations, (ii) release budget appropriations according to financial plans and use cash-flow \nforecasting to smooth payment financing, and (iii) create a central accounting system using a \nchart of accounts built to reflect the revised budget classification in line with the Government \nFinance  Statistics  Manual  (GFSM  2001)  and  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting \nStandards and off-budget flows. The GFMIS will also have a report generation facility to meet \nbudget  performance  needs  for  in-year  adjustments  and  policy  analysis.  It  will  also  assist \npromotion of the quality of annual budgets by its timely reporting on fiscal performance, and \nprovide data for checking validity of assumptions, time-series comparisons, and trend analysis \nfor the medium-term budget framework (MTBF). \n \n5.  Over the same period, the Government has also undertaken steps to improve the quality \nof the budget. In 2005, a  medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) was prepared, establishing \ntargets for revenues and expenditures for the next  3 years consistent with the medium-term \nprojections of gross domestic product (GDP). A working group consisting of representatives of \nMOF, Ministry of Economy and the Central Bank of Uzbekistan developed projections of main \nmacroeconomic  parameters,  revenues,  and  expenditures  of  the  state  budget,  and  basic \n                                                 \n1  The 12 oblasts of Uzbekistan, the city of Tashkent, and the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n ", "56          Appendix 10 \ndirections of the budgetary policy for 2005\u20132007, laying the foundation for an MTBF consistent \nwith the MTFF.  \n \n6.  Work  has  also  begun  to  formulate  the  budget  on  the  basis  of  output  and  policy \nobjectives rather than input norms. An experimental budgeting program is being introduced in \nselected  ministries.  Considerable  work  has  been  done  in  developing  a  revised  budget \nclassification system in line with international standards as laid down in the GFSM 2001. This \nincludes development of a unified chart of accounts to reflect the revised budget classification \nand detailed accounting instructions \n \nB.   Technical Assistance Impact, Outcome, Outputs and Components \n \n7.  The impact of the technical assistance (TA) project will be improved budget preparation \nand execution under a budget classification consistent with international best practices, and \nimproved  linkage  between  budgeting  and  policy  objectives  and  investment  programs.  The \noutcome  of  the  TA  project  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  the  Government  in  budget \npreparation and execution using the revised budget classification. The TA project is to address \nthe immediate capacity-building needs and focus on the areas not covered by other donors \neither now or in the near future. While the TA project will aim to have a nationwide impact, its \ntraining program will pay special attention to strengthening the capacity of relevant staff from \nMOF, Treasury, local treasury offices, Budget Department, MOE, and line ministries selected for \npilot program budgeting.  \n \n8.  The TA project will have two components: (i) support for budget preparation, and (ii) \nsupport for budget execution through  treasury operations using the GFMIS. The TA project \noutputs will comprise (i) development of  user manuals on budget preparation and  treasury \noperation under the revised budget classification;  (ii)  development  of  training  modules  and \nmaterials in budget preparation and execution using the revised budget classification system; \n(iii) development of performance indicators for the education sector; and (iv) training of 17 staff \nfrom MOF, Treasury, Budget Department, and Treasury Training Center on budget preparation \nand execution based on the revised budget classification. \n \nC.
