Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia is the world\u2019s coldest capital, with temperatures regularly dropping \nbelow \u201320 \u00baC in winter months. In the absence of district heating, the heat supply in ger areas \ncomes from burning raw coal in household stoves and small heat-only boilers, creating some of \nthe highest levels of air pollution in the world.1 Key binding constraints to improving air quality and \nreducing the costs of air pollution are: (i) a weak regulatory framework for air pollution control; (ii) \nthe absence of effectively implemented short-term measures to mitigate pollution and its health \nimpacts; and (iii) inadequate integration of urban and energy planning, leading to inefficient \nenergy use and further constraining alternatives to the use of coal for heating. \n \n2.  During 2018\u20132019, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) implemented the Ulaanbaatar Air \nQuality Improvement Program policy-based loan (phase 1), which sought to establish a basis for \nactions to adapt to and mitigate the air pollution crisis in Ulaanbaatar, and identify and pilot \nimmediate alleviation measures.2 While this support successfully raised the aspirations of the \nGovernment of Mongolia, it faces challenges in taking action given its current fiscal constraints. \nConsequently, the government requested a second policy-based loan (phase 2) to support its \nexpanded targets, build on the impetus delivered by phase 1, and move rapidly towards long-term \nsolutions. \n \n3.  Consistent with this request, the proposed phase 2 aims to (i) embed the strategies to \naddress air pollution developed under phase 1 into Mongolia\u2019s legal and regulatory framework, (ii) \nsupport the government in fully realizing its increased aspirations, and (iii) put in place sustainable \nlong-term measures for a clean heating supply in Ulaanbaatar. Phase 2 will be provided as a \nstandalone policy-based loan in two tranches, with the funds front-loaded to ensure that essential \npolicy actions required for the successful implementation of the raw coal ban during the 2019\u2013\n2020 heating season are undertaken in full. The first tranche of $100 million will be withdrawn \nupon loan effectiveness and is linked to full compliance with individual prior actions focused on \nthe delivery of improved fuels and electric heating to  ger areas, as well as improving the \ninstitutional framework for delivery. The second tranche of $60 million will be withdrawn upon full \ncompliance with remaining individual prior actions, which are linked to longer-term cleaner heating \nsolutions in ger areas. Implementation of the second tranche is from 16 November 2019 to 30 \nSeptember 2020.    \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The government will require assistance in designing and implementing key elements of \nthe reform program where internal capacity is limited. With a policy-based program, there is no \nassociated project loan that can pay for the necessary implementation assistance. The proposed \nloan is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021.3 \n \n5.  The initial program parameters, including scope, key policy actions, financing amount, and \nimplementation arrangements were discussed with the government during a reconnaissance \n \n1  Gers are traditional portable round tents covered with skins or felt and used as dwellings by nomads in the steppes \nof East Asia.

The proposed technical assistance (TA) implementation period is from 16 November 2019 \nto 30 September 2021. The extended implementation period relative to the proposed loan will \nallow for assistance to the government in undertaking agreed measures under the post-program \npartnership framework, which will in turn ensure the sustainability of policy actions under the \nproposed loan.  \n \n7.  Major outputs of the TA include relate to supporting the implementation of policy actions \nand post-program actions related to: (i) climate adaptation, urban resilience and gender and \ncommunity dimensions incorporated in the Ulaanbaatar Master Plan; (ii) clean heat supply plan for \nger areas developed; (iii) study on longer-term electric heating tariff structures conducted; (iv) indoor \nair pollution impact assessment conducted; (v) opportunities for scaling-up and expanding the green \nfinancing mechanism recommended; and (vi) gender and community engagement plan developed.  \n \nB.
