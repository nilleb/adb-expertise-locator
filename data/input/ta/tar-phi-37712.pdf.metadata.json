The Government of the Philippines requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) to strengthen financial market regulation and supervision by improving the \ngovernance of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) and enhancing the regulatory capacities of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee the PSE and other securities \ntrading markets.1 A fact-finding mission was fielded from 10-13 November 2003 and held \ndiscussions with officials from SEC, Department of Finance, PSE, and other stakeholders. The \nmission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost, \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements for the TA.  The TA framework is set forth in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Sound governance is crucial for capital markets to inspire investor confidence and play \nan effective role in supporting growth through channeling savings to productive investment. ADB \nhas been active in supporting efforts to strengthen market governance in the Philippines. \nPrevious interventions include support for establishment of an effective legal and regulatory \nframework, and restructuring of SEC and subsequent capacity building.2 While an effective \nregulatory framework is now in place and SEC\u2019s supervisory capacity has been considerably \nstrengthened, governance- and capacity-related issues remain to be addressed at the exchange \nlevel. The recent listing of PSE shares on the PSE (self-listing) and PSE\u2019s planned divestment \nof shares, along with plans to establish other securities trading markets, present a new set of \nchallenges and will require SEC to develop appropriate capacity to effectively address them.  \n \n3.  To  address  governance  concerns,  the  Securities  Regulation  Code  (SRC)3  includes \nprovisions limiting the participation of brokers on the board of an exchange, requiring an \nexchange board to include at least three independent directors, mandating PSE to convert from \na  non-profit  member  owned  mutual  organization  to  a  for  profit  shareholder  corporation \n(\u201cdemutualize\u201d) within 1 year, and limiting ownership by any one group to no more than 20% of \nthe voting rights of an exchange.  Impetus for enactment of the SRC, and these provisions in \nparticular, was provided by a major trading scandal in early 2000.  The incident highlighted \nweaknesses in PSE's ability to perform effectively as a  self-regulatory organization (SRO) \nbecause it was dominated by broker members  and lacked independence in performing its \ncompliance and surveillance functions. \n \n4.      The crisis was exacerbated by the PSE board\u2019s decision not to impose sanctions on \nbrokers involved in the scandal, leading to the resignation en masse of PSE\u2019s compliance and \nsurveillance group. Although some of the compliance and surveillance staff eventually returned, \nPSE lost considerable expertise and experience as a result of the incident. To address this \nconcern, PSE hired a new director and additional staff for this group. Capacity in this area \nneeds to be built and strengthened to enable the PSE to perform more effectively as an SRO.  \n \n5.   Passage of the SRC enabled SEC to ensure that the PSE board was restructured to limit \nthe dominance of brokers. PSE was also demutualized in 2001, but continued to be solely \nbroker owned. A key impediment to divestiture and diversification of ownership has been the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 September 2003.  \n2  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Nonbank Financial Sector Development. \nManila. \n3  Republic Act 8799 enacted in July 2000. ", "2 \nreluctance of brokers to sell their shareholdings due to weak market conditions and lack of \ninvestor interest  (PSE is currently losing money).  \n \n6.  At the end of 2003, PSE self-listed and, pursuant to an SEC mandate, has begun the \nprocess of divestiture and compliance with SRC provisions limiting the extent of  ownership by \nany one group or individual. PSE also submitted a proposal for self-regulation to the SEC, which \ndid  not  effectively  address  potential  conflicts  of  interest  between  the  PSE\u2019s  regulatory \nresponsibilities and its obligation to generate profit for shareholders. In other jurisdictions in the \nAsia-Pacific region where exchanges have demutualized (e.g., Australia; Hong Kong, China; \nJapan; and Singapore), key regulatory concerns include the need to ensure that the public \ninterest  is  safeguarded  and  the  exchange  continues  to  perform  its  regulatory  function.4 \nRegulatory approaches to these issues vary and depend upon the prevailing legal framework \nand regulatory philosophy. In general, regulators review the exchange\u2019s governance structure to \nensure that the public interest is adequately protected and the corporate structure to ensure that \nthe regulatory function continues to be performed and adequate resources are provided. When \nan exchange is self-listed, specific arrangements and memoranda of understanding are often \ndeveloped  to  ensure  regulatory  oversight  of  self-listing.  A  committee  comprised  of \nrepresentatives from SEC and PSE  has been formed to develop a new framework for self-\nregulation to ensure that listing and divestiture strengthens, rather than weakens, corporate \ngovernance. The TA is intended to support the work of this committee.  \n \n7.  SEC lacks experience in regulating a self-listed exchange and will need to develop its \ncapacity in this area. In addition there are plans to establish a fixed income exchange, and rules \nhave recently been issued governing the development and regulation of alternative trading \nsystems. These developments present a new set of regulatory challenges and appropriate \nregulatory capacity will be needed to effectively address them. \n \n8.  The TA builds upon earlier ADB assistance for the capital markets in the Philippines and \ncomplements ongoing work that supports development of a forward-looking strategy to develop \nthe  nonbank  financial  sector.5  SEC  is  not  receiving  any  other  assistance  in  this  area. \nImplementation of the TA will be closely coordinated with development partners.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA aims to contribute to the development of the Philippine capital market through \nthe strengthening of corporate governance and improved regulation of PSE and other securities \ntrading markets. The TA will (i) enhance the ability of PSE to perform its SRO function by \nstrengthening its governance structure, procedures, and capacity;  and (ii) strengthen SEC\u2019s \ncapacity to effectively regulate PSE and other securities trading markets. \n \n10.  The scope of the proposed TA will include the following: \n \n(i)  Governance  review  of  PSE.  This  will  assess  the  corporate  structure  and \ngovernance practices of PSE, including a review of the roles and responsibilities \nof the PSE board. \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2002.

This  will  include  a  review  of  SRO  operations  of  PSE  and \nidentification of appropriate options to address conflicts of interest and enhance \nindependence of PSE\u2019s compliance and surveillance functions.  A similar review \nwill be conducted for other securities trading markets. \n \n(iii)  Capacity building component. For PSE and other securities trading markets, \nthis will include strengthening the capacity of compliance and surveillance staff to \nmonitor compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. The component will include \ndeveloping SEC\u2019s capacity to address new challenges raised by demutualizaton \nand self-listing of PSE, and operation of other securities trading markets. \n \n(iv)  Review of PSE\u2019s business operations. This will include a review of PSE\u2019s \ncurrent fee and cost structures, comparison with the fee and cost structures of \nother exchanges, and development of proposals to strengthen the profitability of \nPSE\u2019s operations and its ability to attract investors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The governance review of PSE will include a written assessment of the corporate \nstructure and governance-related practices, and recommendations to address perceived gaps \nand promote incorporation of best international standards. This will involve close consultation \nwith PSE board members, management, and staff.   \n \n12.  The written review of PSE's SRO functions will identify appropriate options to address \nconflicts of interest that  may arise in connection with performance of such functions.  Other \nsecurities trading markets will be similarly reviewed. \n  \n13.  The capacity-building component will include a written needs assessment for SEC, PSE, \nand  other  securities  trading  markets.  A  suitable  training  program  will  be  designed  and \nimplemented  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  local  training  institutions.  Training \narrangements may also include exchanges of experts with appropriate institutions (e.g., other \nexchanges, securities commissions, etc.) in other countries. Procedural guidelines and training \nmaterials will be prepared with the assistance of the domestic consultant to help SEC, PSE, and \nother trading markets internalize and institutionalize the best practices and procedures.   \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $358,000 equivalent, comprising $208,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $150,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$250,000 equivalent on a grant basis, to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $42,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs. ADB\u2019s portion will be funded by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe SEC will provide facilities and counterpart support valued at $108,000 equivalent. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is attached (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  SEC as the Executing Agency for the TA will coordinate and facilitate the effective \nimplementation of the TA. The Implementing Agency (IA) will include PSE. The TA will be \nimplemented over 10 months and is expected to commence in March 2004 and finish in \nDecember 2004.
