An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared for \nAssessment  each of the Cambodian and Viet Nam sections. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  complete  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Southern \nCoastal Corridor (GMS-SCC) Corridor in Cambodia and Viet Nam. The \nProject will include the following components:  \n(i)  Rehabilitation  of  transport  infrastructure.  In  Cambodia, \n15 kilometers (km) of National Road (NR)33 will be improved to the \nborder  with  Viet  Nam  at  Preak  Chak.  In  Viet  Nam,  96.1  km  of \nnational  highway  (QL)  80  and  QL63  will  be  improved,  including \nconstruction of two large bridges across the Cai Be and Cai Lon \nRivers.  \n(ii) Cross-border  facilities.  New  cross-border  facilities  will  be \nconstructed, whose designs will take into account the ongoing work \nunder the ADB\u2019s TA6307-REG on the Implementation of the GMS \nCross-Border Transport Agreement approved in 2006. \n(iii) HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program. \n(iv) Road maintenance in Cambodia.  \n   \nRationale  The SCC is one of 10 high priority subregional road projects identified to \nfacilitate cross-border trade and support economic development in the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  countries.  Cooperation  in  the \ntransport sector has been given a high priority in the GMS because the \npoor state of transport infrastructure is a major constraint to economic \ngrowth, trade and other forms of cooperation. The poor transport system \nrestricts  access  to  job  opportunities,  markets,  schools,  and  health \nfacilities.  Therefore,  the  provision of  improved  roads  in  areas  where \npopulations currently do not have good access will have a major impact \non their livelihoods. Although sections of the GMS-SCC in Thailand and \nCambodia  are  in  good  condition,  the  highway  is  not  complete  in \nCambodia  and  much  of  the  Vietnamese  section  requires  major \nrehabilitation and improvements. By reducing travel times and vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs) along the GMS-SCC, the Project will encourage \neconomic  activities  in  the  affected  provinces,  provide  employment \nopportunities  for  the  local  population,  and  improve  access  to  social \nservices. At the national level, the Project responds to the emphasis \ngiven by both governments to infrastructure development and to improve \nthe GMS road network. \n   ", "ii   \nImpact and  The impact of the GMS-SCC Project will be the promotion of economic \nOutcome  growth in the project area and GMS by strengthening connectivity with \nneighboring countries and increasing competitiveness. The outcome of \nthe proposed GMS-SCC Project will be to reduce transport times and \ncosts; and induce more efficient movement of passengers and goods \nbetween Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and within project provinces. \n   \nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $227.4  million, \nPlan   including taxes and duties of $15.0 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Total \nSource  Cambodia  %  Viet Nam  %  ($ million)  % \nADB  7.0  37  75.0  36  82.0  36 \nGovernment of \nAustraliaa  8.0  43  25.5  12  33.5  15 \nGovernment of \nthe Republic of \nKorea  0.0  0  50.0  24  50.0  22 \nGovernment of \nCambodia  3.7  20  0.0  0  3.7  2 \nGovernment of \nViet Nam  0.0  0  58.2  28  58.2  25 \nTotal  18.7  100  208.7  100  227.4  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \na The amounts stated for the Government of Australia grants are inclusive of ADB's \nadministration fees of $200,000 for Cambodia and $500,000 for Viet Nam. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a \nTerms  loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia of $7 million equivalent and a loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam of $75 million equivalent. The loans \nwill be denominated in special drawing rights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with terms of 32 years and grace periods of 8 years. There will \nbe an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace periods and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n  The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  through  the  Economic \nDevelopment  Cooperation  Fund,  will  provide  a  loan  of  $50  million \nequivalent to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam that will be denominated \nin won and have a term of 30 years including a grace period of 10 years. \nThere will be an interest charge of 1% per annum charged throughout \nthe term of the loan and a service charge of 0.1% on the amount of each \ndisbursement. The Government of the Republic of Korea financing will \nbe tied and made available as parallel cofinancing. \n \nGrant Amount  The  Government  of  Australia    will  provide  a  grant  of  $8.0  million \nequivalent to the Kingdom of Cambodia and a grant of $25.5 million \nequivalent to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. These amounts also \ninclude ADB's administration fee, audit cost, bank charges and provision \nfor foreign exchange fluctuations (if any), to the extent that these items \nare not covered by the interest and investment income earned on this \ngrant,  or  any  additional  grant  contribution  by  the  Government  of \nAustralia.  \n   ", "  iii\nPeriod of  Cambodia: 31 December 2012; Viet Nam: 30 June 2015 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  Cambodia: 30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date  Viet Nam: 31 December 2014 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Cambodia.

Separate \nconsultants and contractors will be procured for the sections financed by \nADB and the Republic of Korea. Kien Giang and Ca Mau Provincial \nPeople\u2019s Committees (PPCs) will be responsible for preparation and \nimplementation of the resettlement plans, and will direct implementation \nof the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  all  works  financed  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nAustralia  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Implementing  agencies  in \nCambodia,  PMU-3,  and  Viet  Nam,  PMU-MT,  are  familiar  with  ADB \nprocurement  requirements.  Cambodia.  Under  the  rehabilitation  of \ntransport infrastructure and cross-border facilities components, four civil \nworks contracts will be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts under the maintenance component will be \nsuitably  packaged  through  a  number  of  contracts  where  contracts \ncosting more than $100,000 and less than $1 million may follow national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Viet  Nam.  Under  the \nrehabilitation  of  transport  infrastructure  and  cross-border  facilities \ncomponents, there will be seven contracts. For the component funded \nby ADB and the Government of Australia, two major civil works contracts \nwill  be  procured  using  ICB  procedures  with  prequalification; \ndocumentation will be subject to prior review. Other smaller civil works \ncontracts costing more than $100,000 and less than $2 million will follow \nNCB  procedures.  Procurement  of  civil  works  under  the  component \nfunded by the Government of the Republic of Korea will be subject to \nRepublic of Korea procurement guidelines and procedures. \n ", "iv   \n   \nConsulting  For all consulting services funded from ADB loan funds and Government \nServices  of Australia grant funds, international and national consultants will be \nrecruited through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consulting Services (2007, as amended from time to time).

A firm of consultants will be recruited to undertake all \nservices required for the Project under a single contract to be funded \nusing  Government  of  Australia  grant  funds.  Recruitment  for  these \nservices will use quality and cost-based recruitment procedures (80:20) \nwith full technical proposals. Viet Nam. A Government of Australia grant-\nfunded contract for the detailed design and implementation supervision \npackage will cover detailed design and construction supervision of the \nsection funded by ADB and the Government of Australia, and the HIV \nand trafficking awareness and prevention program for all components in \nViet  Nam.  Under  the  component  funded  by  the  Government  of  the \nRepublic of Korea, a single package will be prepared for the detailed \ndesign and construction supervision of the Republic of Korea funded \nsection. \n   \nProject Benefits  The major beneficiaries of the Project will be the residents of the project \nand Beneficiaries  area. Both poor and nonpoor residents are heavy road users\u2014over 86% \nof people living in the project area use the roads daily or several times a \nweek. By reducing travel times and VOCs along the corridor, the Project \nwill  encourage  economic  activities  in  the  affected  provinces,  provide \nemployment opportunities for the local population, and improve access \nto social services. The Project's economic benefits are primarily derived \nfrom VOC savings and travel time savings. The estimated economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project road is 16.7% indicating that \nthe Project is economically viable. The results of sensitivity testing and \nrisk analyses indicate that the project is robust with a very low risk of the \nEIRR falling below the minimum acceptable EIRR of 12%. \n   \nRisks and  The Project has been designed to reduce potential risks, which include \nAssumptions  delays  in  implementation  because  of  inadequate  implementation \ncapacity of MPWT in Cambodia and VRA in Viet Nam, failure to provide \ncounterpart financing on time, the traffic forecast not being realized, and \ninadequate road maintenance. There is a major risk of corruption and \nfraud  in  the  procurement  process  in  Cambodia.  The  Government  of \nCambodia has not complied with a number of loan covenants under \nongoing road subsector projects. Although progress is now being made \ntoward meeting these covenants, the risk of noncompliance remains. \nResettlement can lead to impoverishment if adequate compensation and \nrehabilitation assistance are not provided to enable affected households \nto  replace  their  losses  and  restore  their  livelihoods.  There  is  an \nincreased risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS during construction activities and \nthe potential for increased trafficking of women and children because of \nlarge volumes of transit traffic along the GMS-SCC and the border area. \n ", "Penh 105 o 00'E \nm \nPhno GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION\nto  SOUTHERN COASTAL CORRIDOR PROJECT\nNR31\nKampot\nNR33 CAMBODIA Nha Bang\nKampong Trach\nto Sihanoukville and\nThailand\nKep NR33 AN  GIANG\nPreak Chak Tri Ton\nXa Xia\nHa Tien Long Xuyen\nKIEN LUONG\nQL80 Kien Luong\nHON DAT\nKIEN GIANG\nHon Dat\nTAN HIEP CAN  THO\nNational Capital Rach Gia Bay Soc Son\nProvincial Capital QL80\nCHAU\nCity/Town THANH\nRach Gia\nGreater Mekong Subregion\n  Southern Coastal Corridor (GMS-SCC) QL61 Chau Thanh VIET  NAM\nGMS-SCC Project - Cambodian Component\nMinh Luong GIONG GIANG\nGMS-SCC Project - Viet Nam Component Stage 1 Tac Cau Ferry\nKien An\nFuture Viet Nam Stage 2 An Bien Ben Nhu\nNR33 ONathtieorn Nala Rtioonaadl  (aCnadm Pbroodviian)cial Road Thu Bay QL63 GO QUAO Ap Luc\nQL61 National Road (Viet Nam)\nHAU  GIANG\nTL7 Provincial Road (Viet Nam)\nAN MINH\nRiver VINH\nDPrisotvriicntc Biaol uBnoduanrdyary An Minh TL7Nga Bac Canal THUAN\nInternational Boundary\n9 o 30'N  Vinh Thuan 9 o 30'N \nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nU MINH\nThoi Binh \nBAC  LIEU\nTHOI\n103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E BINH\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nOF  CHINA\nKhanh An Industrial Zone\nHa Noi\nHai Phong TRAN VAN THOI Ca Mau\n20 o 00\u2019N LAO Gulf  of 20 o 00\u2019N\nPEOPLE'S Tonkin\nDEMOCRATIC\n REPUBLIC Hong My\nCA  MAU\nCAI NUOC\nDAM DOI\nSOCIALIST Cai Nuoc\nREPUBLIC OF\nVIET NAM\nTHAILAND\nBangkok\nCAMBODIA Nam Can N\n12 o 00\u2019N Phnom Penh 12 o 00\u2019N\nSouth NGOC HIEN 0 25 50 75 100\nChina\nGulf  of Ho Chi Minh City Sea  Kilometers\nThailand Nam Can Project Area\n103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E 105 o 00'E \n07-2540 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  and  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Southern Coastal Corridor Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor (GMS-SCC) Project is part of \nthe  Southern  Economic  Corridor  involving  Thailand,  Cambodia,  and  Viet  Nam 1\u2014one  of \n11 flagship  programs  endorsed  by  the  First  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Summit  in \nCambodia in November 2002 to achieve the GMS vision of a prosperous, more integrated, and \nharmonious subregion. The GMS-SCC runs for 924 kilometers (km) along the Gulf of Thailand \ncoast from Bangkok through Thailand, Cambodia, and ends at Nam Can in the south of Viet Nam. \nThe SCC is one of 10 high priority subregional road projects identified in a Subregional Transport \nSector  Study  completed  in  1994 2  to  facilitate  cross-border  trade  and  support  economic \ndevelopment in the GMS countries. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  The principal mode of transport for the movement of goods and people within Cambodia \nand Viet Nam, and between countries in the GMS, is by road. The road network in both Cambodia \nand Viet Nam has developed significantly over the past 10 years, with support from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners, enabling more efficient movement of \ngoods and people between regions and provinces. However, although much has been achieved \nin terms of rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road transport system, the condition of the \ntransport system continues to restrict the economic and social development of both countries. \nPoor transport connections restrict access to job opportunities, markets, schools, and health \nfacilities. Therefore, the provision of improved roads in areas where populations currently do not \nhave good access will have a major impact on their livelihoods.  \n \n4.  Sections  of  the  GMS-SCC  within  Thailand  and  Cambodia  are  complete  or  under \nconstruction, with the exception of a short unimproved length of Cambodia\u2019s national road (NR) \n33 leading to the Viet Nam border at Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia. For the section of the GMS-SCC in \nCambodia between the Thai border and Kampot, the highway has been improved or is being \nimproved  under  projects  funded  by  the  Government  of  Thailand,  World  Bank,  and  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea. In Viet Nam, the GMS-SCC runs from the south of the \nCambodian border through Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces to Ca Mau city on sections of \nnational highway (QL) 80, QL61, and QL63. Road conditions on the Vietnamese section vary from \na two-lane highway in reasonable condition, particularly the section of QL80 between Ha Tien and \nMinh Luong, to a narrow earth track only accessible by motorcycles.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Southern Economic Corridor is defined by three main road subcorridors and their areas of influence: (i) Central \nSubcorridor: Bangkok (Thailand)\u2013Phnom Penh (Cambodia)-Ho Chi Minh City\u2013Vung Tau (Viet Nam); (ii) Southern \nCoastal Subcorridor: Bangkok\u2013Trat (Thailand)\u2013Koh Kong\u2013Kampot (Cambodia)\u2013Ha Tien\u2013Ca Mau\u2013Nam Can (Viet \nNam);  and  (iii)  Northern  Subcorridor:  Bangkok  (Thailand)\u2013Siem  Reap\u2013Stung  Treng\u2013Rattanakiri\u2013      O  Yadav \n(Cambodia)\u2013Play Ku\u2013Quy Nhon (Viet Nam).

The Southern Economic Corridor will strive to improve subregional economic cooperation between and \namong Cambodia, Thailand, Viet Nam, and to a limited extent, southern Lao PDR, by, among others, upgrading \ncritical links in the Asian Highway from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City via Phnom Penh. \n2  ADB. 1993. Technical Assistance for Promoting Subregional Cooperation among Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. ", "2   \n5.  The  limited  extent  and  quality  of  current  roads  in  the  project  area  within  Viet  Nam, \nparticularly in the southern part of Kien Giang province and the northwestern part of Cau Mau \nprovince, require that most passenger and freight transport now use water transport. The high \ncost of carrying value-added freight by water transport has limited economic growth in these \nregions, with rice production dominating. It is expected that improved road transport will allow \nother production such as aquaculture and horticulture to grow substantially. This potential would \nbe enhanced by ensuring that producers can make effective use of both water and road transport \nthrough enhanced intermodal transport. Landing stages play an important role in linking rural \nproducers to the main transport networks through which they obtain inputs and market their \nproduce, as they provide locations at which collection, consolidation, and distribution occurs.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  In Cambodia, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) is responsible for the \noverall management and development of the transport sector. Given the condition of the road \nnetwork, expenditure on roads for maintenance has been well below the required level. Until \n2007, no annual budget has been provided and funds are only made available under ad hoc \narrangements. Of the work that has been undertaken, force account procedures have been used \nwith rates determined by negotiations. Under the GMS Cambodia Road Improvement Project,3 \nprograms were included to address road maintenance requirements and related organizational \nchanges. These programs had not been implemented and the associated loan covenants had not \nbeen complied with. However, the following requirements were met as conditions for appraisal of \nthis Project: (i) that an updated draft of the Road Transport Policy be prepared; (ii) that an \nInterministerial Committee for Reorganization with authority to review and advise on the reform of \nMPWT be reestablished; (iii) that a proposal for the restructuring of MPWT be submitted by the \nminister of MPWT to the Interministerial Committee for Reorganization; and (iv) based on an \nannual maintenance plan and budget for 2007 for all national and provincial roads, the Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance (MEF) shall have authorized its Treasury Division to disburse an advance \npayment of 40% of the 2007 budget. By meeting the above requirements, significant progress has \nbeen made in meeting the loan covenants under the Cambodia Road Improvement Project. ADB \nis now preparing the Road Asset Management Project (RAMP) for approval in 2007. If approved, \nthis project is to be cofinanced by the World Bank and Government of Australia. The RAMP \nproject will address the long-term sustainability of the MPWT road network by establishing a \nconsistent and prioritized road management system through systematic maintenance planning. \nThe RAMP project will also address the issue of ensuring sustainable long-term funding for the \nroad network by identifying funding sources and mechanisms, including options to generate \nrevenue by tolling major routes.  \n \n7.  In Viet Nam, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) is responsible for the overall management \nand development of the transport sector. The Viet Nam Road Administration (VRA) under MOT is \nin charge of the national roads network. The Provincial People\u2019s Committee (PPC) for each \nprovince  has  been  delegated  responsibility  for  the  provincial  road  networks.  The  budget \nallocations to undertake road maintenance are relatively small\u2014the cost of routine and periodic \nmaintenance in the project area averages $820/km for provincial roads and $1,320/km for national \nroads. However, expenditure on road maintenance has been rising rapidly. For example, the \nbudget allocation for maintenance of national roads increased from D592 billion in 2002 to D946 \nbillion  in  2004  (still  only  50%  of  the  required  amount  estimated  by  VRA).  National  roads \nmaintenance is being supported by the World Bank-funded Road Network Improvement Project, \nwhich has developed a standardized road maintenance system for application in both national \nand provincial roads throughout Viet Nam. The Road Network Improvement Project includes a \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Subregional traffic is dominated by roads for both freight and passenger traffic. Although \nsubregional traffic is still modest between Cambodia and Viet Nam, great efforts are being made \nto promote and ease international traffic, develop effective cross-border agreements to facilitate \nmovement of goods and people, and develop border crossing infrastructure and border access \nroads. Completion of the GMS-SCC offers enormous potential to facilitate the movement of goods \nand people between Cambodia and Viet Nam, given the fast-growing economic interaction that is \ntaking place between the two countries. Traffic movements at the Bavet\u2013Moc Bai crossing have \nalready increased significantly since the improvements and rehabilitation of the Phnom Penh to \nHo Chi Minh City road. The Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia crossing is expected to develop in a similar way; \na small industrial zone has already been established and a cement plant has been proposed. \n \n9.  In February 2007, Cambodia and Viet Nam signed a memorandum of understanding to \ninclude  the  Preak  Chak\u2013Xa  Xia4 border  crossing  under  the  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport \nAgreement  (CBTA).  Under  the  CBTA,  the  border  will  be  opened  to  international  traffic  and \nprocedures will be adopted for improving the efficiency of goods and passenger processing\u2014\neventually leading to harmonized single-stop inspections and processing. Viet Nam has recently \ncompleted a new cross-border facility at Xa Xia in anticipation of opening the border. The existing \nborder  post  at  Preak  Chak  is  not  adequate  to  handle  forecasted  international  cargo  and \npassenger traffic and a new, enlarged facility will be required.   \n \n10.  At the Koh Kong crossing between Cambodia and Thailand, trade has been severely \nlimited by the need to traverse four major rivers by small ferries on the journey between the \nborder and the junction with NR4, connecting Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville. Consequently, use of \nthis border crossing is limited to local traffic. A major rehabilitation of this road, which includes \nnew bridges at the four rivers, is expected to be completed by mid-2008 with Government of \nThailand funding. This will connect southeastern Cambodia to the rest of Cambodia for the first \ntime, and an alternative route between Phnom Penh and Bangkok will be useable. \n \n11.  Subregional  Strategy.  The  ultimate  objective  of  the  GMS  strategy  is  to  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth,  improve  employment  opportunities,  and  reduce  poverty  in  the \nsubregion by tapping the comparative advantages of the participating countries. In 2006, a GMS \nTransport Sector Strategy5 was prepared for the period up to 2015 based on the theme \u201cTowards \nSeamless Transport Services on a fully connected and integrated GMS Transport Network\u201d. To \ndevelop the transport infrastructure of the GMS, the strategy proposed the goals of (i) sectoral \nfocus,  (ii)  comprehensive  inter-sectoral  strategy,  and  (iii)  goal  setting  and  results-oriented \nmanagement. The proposed Project will assist in achieving the strategy\u2019s objectives. An overview \nof the development of the transport sector in the GMS, including the development and status of \nthe CBTA is in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  From  the  national  perspective,  improvement  of  the  road  system  will  support  broader \ndevelopment objectives, principally to facilitate (i) the movement of agricultural products from \nsurplus to deficit areas, (ii) flow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, and (iii) \nmarketing and export of cash crops and other produce. In both Cambodia and Viet Nam, the \nProject will meet the governments\u2019 objective of completing the improvement of its road transport \nsystem,  particularly  with  regard  to  facilitating  trade  and  improving  access  between  the  two \ncountries.   \n                                                 \n4  Sometimes referred to as the Lork\u2013Xa Xia or the Preak Chak\u2013Ha Tien Border Crossing. \n5  ADB. 2006. Final Report of the Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy. Manila (TA 6195-REG). \n ", "4   \n13.  ADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program for the GMS was \napproved in March 2004. The Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update, 2007\u20132009, \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion6 noted progress in implementing the strategic pillars of the \nRegional Cooperation Strategy and Program, which provide the backbone of ADB assistance \ntoward enhancing connectivity, improving competitiveness, and engendering a greater sense of \ncommunity in the GMS. The GMS-SCC Project is consistent with the RSCP. Through regional \ncollective action, ADB\u2019s Strategy for Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration7 aims to \ngenerate greater physical connectivity; expansion of trade and investment; macroeconomic and \nfinancial stability and development of financial systems; and improved environmental, health, and \nsocial conditions. The GMS-SCC Project is consistent with the Strategy for Regional Economic \nCooperation and Integration. \n \n14.  External  Assistance.  Most  of  the  assistance  to  Cambodia\u2019s  road  sector  has  been \ndirected at restoring a basic level of access to as much of the country as possible through \nrehabilitation of the primary road network. In Viet Nam, projects initially focused on rehabilitating \nQL1, which runs along the east coast of Viet Nam and acts as the central spine for the road \nnetwork. Subsequently, integral parts of the GMS economic corridors in Viet Nam were improved \nunder  ADB-funded  projects.  Appendix  3  details  external  assistance  to  GMS  transport \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n15.  Lessons. In Cambodia, the main lesson in the road sector is that project design must take \ninto account the limitations caused by institutional and financing deficiencies in MPWT. Although \nits capacity to handle ADB-financed projects has improved considerably in recent years, certain \naspects still need improvement. The key lessons from these loans were that there was a need to \nensure that (i) procurement approval is delegated to the project management unit; (ii) processes \nfor  approving  bid  documents  and  awarding  contracts  that  are  applicable  to  ADB-financed \ncontracts  under  a  loan  are  clarified  at  the  outset;  (iii)  satisfactory  resettlement  plans  and \nframeworks are in place before loans are approved; (iv) specific environmental requirements, \nincluding documentation and reporting requirements, are included in loan covenant and bidding \ndocuments; and (v) agreement on the release of counterpart funds is reached with MEF. On early \nroad  sector  projects,  significant  issues  arose  with  respect  to  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation. On the Cambodian section of the Phnom Penh \u2013 Ho Chin Minh City Project,8 \nproblems arose due to the highway right-of-way not being clearly defined, and resettlement \nimplementation did not comply with the agreed resettlement plan. This resulted in a number of \naffected  people  not  receiving  appropriate  compensation,  relocation  and  income  restoration \nassistance. During the course of a resettlement audit in 2005 many of these affected people were \nidentified and compensation payments, and other actions, were completed by the Interministerial \nResettlement Committee (IRC) by October 2006. However, in May 2006 two additional groups of \naffected people were identified, claims made by these groups have been investigated and most \nhave been resolved by the IRC. The remaining cases are still under investigation by the IRC, \nNGOs and ADB. On 30 July 2007 a complaint was made to the ADB\u2019s Office of the Special \nProject  Facilitator.  The  Special  Project  Facilitator  deemed  the  complaint  to  be  valid  on  19 \nSeptember 2007 and investigations are now ongoing. In general, the capacity of both MPWT and \nthe IRC to address resettlement issues has improved significantly since the early projects and the \nproblems encountered on the Phnom Penh \u2013 Ho Chi Minh City Project have not been repeated. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

In Viet Nam, several review missions have noted implementation delays in previous road \nprojects, especially during the project start-up phase. Project designs have required that project \nsupervision consultants prepare detailed designs and bidding documents for civil works. Delays in \nrecruiting consultants or preparing detailed designs have led to delays in the award of civil works. \nTo alleviate these problems, the project design was developed based on a detailed understanding \nof both ADB and Government of Viet Nam approval procedures, and the project implementation \nschedule has allowed adequate time for these procedures. Inadequate resettlement planning has \nalso caused delays but this is a low risk for new projects since MOT\u2019s capacity to address \nresettlement needs has improved considerably in recent years, in terms resettlement planning \nand implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the GMS-SCC Project will be to promote economic growth in the project \narea  and  the  GMS  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries  and  increasing \ncompetitiveness. \n \n18.  The outcome of the Project will be to reduce transport times and costs on the GMS-SCC, \nand  induce  more  efficient  movement  of  passengers  and  goods  within  the  project  area  and \nbetween GMS countries.  \n \n19.  The project area includes the provinces of Kampot in Cambodia (population 0.58 million), \nand Kien Giang (population 1.63 million) and Ca Mau (population 1.20 million) in Viet Nam. The \nimmediate project area has a population of 0.09 million in Cambodia and 1.44 million in Viet Nam. \nIn Cambodia, the Project is located in an agricultural area between Kampong Trach market town \nand the border at Preak Chak. In Viet Nam, the Project runs alongside a series of canals through \nland used primarily for rice production. There is some shrimp farming, chiefly in locations with \ngood  transport  links,  with  considerable  potential  for  growth  in  higher  value  aquaculture  and \nhorticultural production. Industrial activity is limited to the major towns (e.g., cement production in \nKien Luong) and an industrial complex is under construction in Ca Mau to be fuelled from offshore \ngas sources.  \n \n20.  The scope of the GMS-SCC Project extends from Kampot in Cambodia to the Cambodia\u2013\nViet  Nam  border  at  Preak  Chak\u2013Xa  Xia  to  Ca  Mau  in  Viet  Nam.  Under  the  Cambodian \ncomponent, the Project will undertake improve and rehabilitate sections of NR31 and NR33. This \nwill include periodic maintenance work on the Kampot\u2013Kampong Trach section, upgrading of the \nKampong  Trach\u2013Preak  Chak  section,  and  routine  maintenance  works  on  NR31  between \nKampong Trach and the junction with NR3. Border facilities at the Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia (Ha Tien) \nborder  (between  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam)  and  Koh  Kong  border  (between  Cambodia  and \nThailand) will be improved under the Project. During the ADB-funded project preparation work, the \nneeds of the entire corridor within Viet Nam were identified and reviewed at a feasibility level. \nImplementation of the Viet Nam component will be undertaken under two or more stages because \nof funding constraints. Funding is currently available for stage 1 of the GMS-SCC Project, which \nincludes improvement of a short section of QL80 between the border at Xa Xia and Ha Tien, and \ncompletion  of  the  transport  corridor  to  Ca  Mau  on  the  Minh  Luong\u2013Ca  Mau  city  section. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Enhancing the Resettlement Legal Framework and Capacity Building. Manila \n(TA 4490-CAM). \n ", "6   \nImprovements to be funded under future stages will include improvements to the Ha Tien\u2013Rach \nGia section of QL80 and a bypass to Rach Gia. \n \n21.  Existing road traffic on NR33 in Cambodia between Kampong Trach and Preak Chak is \nrelatively  low,  with  average  annual  daily  traffic  (AADT)  levels  of  about  200  motor  vehicles \nexcluding motorcycles. Traffic crossing the border is negligible\u2014one or two trucks exchanging \ncargoes in the neutral zone and minor motorcycle and pedestrian movements. In Viet Nam, traffic \non QL80 between Xa Xia and Ha Tien is low but it builds up along the corridor, and the highest \nlevels occur on the approaches to Rach Gia and Rach Soi where AADT levels are about 2,000 \nmotor vehicles and greater than 10,000 motorcycles. There is a sharp decrease in traffic south of \nthe Tac Cau ferry, especially in motor vehicles, demonstrating the suppressing effect of the ferry \nservice. The Tac Cau ferry is a major impediment to transport in the corridor south of Rach Gia. \nThere has been a large increase in ferry traffic, with passenger and vehicle volumes doubling over \nthe past 5 years. The levels of road traffic north and south of the ferry on QL63 differ significantly, \npartly because of the fishing industries located on the Cai Be and Cai Lon rivers but also because \nof the general level of suppressed traffic caused by the cost and time involved in the ferry \ncrossing. Traffic between Thu Bay and Ca Mau city declines to an AADT of about 200 motor \nvehicles. Motor vehicle traffic largely comprises buses and trucks, reflecting the low level of \nprivate vehicle ownership. Trucks of all weights operate on QL80, QL61, and sections of QL63 \nwhere bridges have weight limits of 15 tons or more. No heavy trucks and very few medium trucks \ntravel on the corridor south of the Tac Cau ferry because of the restrictions on vehicle size and \nweight imposed by the ferry and the remaining single-lane bridges. \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  Project outputs will include the following. Additional details of the proposed civil works are \nin Appendix 4. \n \n1.  Rehabilitation of Transport Infrastructure \n23.  In Cambodia, NR33 will be improved to national road standard from the intersection with \nNR31 in Kampong Trach to the border with Viet Nam at Preak Chak, a distance of 15 km. The \nwork will include replacing an existing steel bridge in the center of the border neutral zone. \n \n24.  In Viet Nam, QL80 between the Cambodia border at Xa Xia and the start of the Ha Tien \nbypass, and QL63 between Minh Luong and the start of the Tac Cau Bypass, will be widened \nalong the existing alignments. At Tac Cau, a 6.4 km bypass will be constructed about 1 km south \nand east of the existing QL63. This bypass requires four bridges, including two large bridges \nacross Cai Be River (about 600 meters [m] total length) and Cai Lon River (about 680 m total \nlength). QL63 between the end of the Tac Cau bypass and Thu Bay will be widened, and the \nconstruction  of  Thu  Bay  Bypass  will  be  completed  under  the  Project.  Rehabilitation  and \nimprovements to Provincial Road 7 will be undertaken between Thu Bay and Nga Bac Canal and \nfrom the Nga Bac Canal to Ca Mau, a new embankment will be constructed along the alignment \nof an existing track. The embankment for the existing access track will not be disturbed to avoid \npotential instability of canal banks. Bridgeworks on the Nga Bac Canal to Ca Mau section will \ninclude construction of 30 small or medium bridges across feeder canals and nine large bridges. \nThe Project will identify key locations for improvements to existing public landings to facilitate \nintermodal transfers between road and water transport. This will coordinate with the Mekong \nTransport Infrastructure Development Project, funded by the World Bank with cofinancing from \nthe  Government  of  Australia,  which  will  consider  the  development  of  intermodal  transport \ninfrastructure and services in the Mekong Delta in more detail. \n \n \n ", "    7 \n2.  Cross-Border Facilities \n25.    The GMS-SCC crosses borders between Cambodia and Thailand at Koh Kong, and \nbetween  Cambodia  and  Thailand  at  Preak  Chak\u2013Xa  Xia.  Current  facilities  at  both  border \ncrossings are inadequate. A complete new facility will be constructed at Preak Chak on the \nCambodian side; on the Vietnamese side, additional facilities to facilitate passenger and cargo \ninspections and processing are required to supplement those provided in a recently completed \nbuilding. The overall design of the cross-border facility will be a single design spanning both sides \nof the border and will take into account ongoing work on the implementation of the GMS CBTA.10 \nAt Koh Kong, a new facility will be constructed on the Cambodia side that will be designed to take \ninto account the requirements of the GMS CBTA. Coordination with the Government of Thailand \nwill  be  undertaken  through  existing  committees  established  to  coordinate  border-crossing \narrangements.  \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS and Trafficking Awareness and Prevention Program  \n26.  To address the increased risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS during construction activities, and \nthe potential for increased trafficking of women and children because of large volumes of transit \ntraffic along the GMS-SCC and the border area, the Project includes an HIV/AIDS and trafficking \nawareness and prevention campaign. This will be implemented through existing agencies in \nCambodia and Viet Nam, with assistance from consultants engaged under the Project, and will \ncomplement ongoing programs. Plan components include advocacy actions on HIV/AIDS and \ntrafficking,  information  and  education  campaigns  on  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking,  provision  of \ncomprehensive HIV/AIDS medical packages to clinics and medical centers along the road, and \nmonitoring. The plan will also address the needs of ethnic minorities. \n \n4.  Road Maintenance in Cambodia \n27.  Lack of adequate maintenance of road assets has been one of the major issues in the \nroad sector in Cambodia. The Project will contribute to the development of sustainable road \nmaintenance by providing funds for technical support to MPWT through a demonstration project \nthat will include (i) maintenance planning, (ii) implementation of routine and periodic maintenance \nthrough  competitively  bid  contracts,  (iii)  exposure  of  Cambodian  contractors  to  contracts  for \nroutine and periodic maintenance, (iv) exposure of MPWT and Provincial Department of Public \nWorks and Transport (PDPWT) staff to maintenance planning and implementation of this plan \nthrough competitively bid contracts, and (v) establishment of market rates for maintenance work \nthat can be used to evaluate and standardize maintenance costs. This demonstration project will \nbe implemented on the section of the GMS-SCC along NR33 between Kampot and Kampong \nTrach, and the section of NR31 between Kampong Trach and the junction with NR3. Work under \nthis component is consistent with, and will be coordinated with, work to be undertaken under the \nproposed RAMP (para. 6.). Both this component and the RAMP support the development of long-\nterm sustainability of the road network in Cambodia. \n \nC.  Special Features \n28.  Regional Cooperation. The Project considers the improvement of border facilities as an \nimportant element in encouraging economic growth and increasing trade opportunities between \nCambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. While the likely scale of the flow through the new crossing \nbetween Cambodia and Viet Nam at Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia is difficult to quantify with precision \nbecause of the absence of a current formal crossing, regional population and industrial output \nsuggest that future flows could be 10\u201330% of the concurrent traffic flows using the Bavet\u2013Moc Bai \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2006.

The CBTA will apply at both border crossings.  \n ", "8   \ncrossing on the road linking Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. The increase in cross-border \nactivities between Moc Bai on the Viet Nam border and Bavet on the Cambodia border, improved \nunder the Phnom Penh\u2013Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project (footnote 8), started increasing around \n2003 and 2004, soon after the completion of the upgrading of facilities at the border. The total \nvalue of trade through the Moc Bai\u2013Bavet border posts has increased at around 41% per annum \nfrom 2003 to 2006. People crossing the border have increased at an average rate of 53% from \n2003 to 2006 while vehicles crossing the border have increased at an average rate of 38% during \nthe same period.  \n \n29.  Resettlement. Three full resettlement plans have been prepared based on the preliminary \ndesign available\u2014one for NR33 in Cambodia, and one each for Ca Mau Province and Kien Giang \nProvinces in Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, 3,775 households will be affected by loss of residential, \ncommercial,  or  agricultural  land  within  the  corridors  of  impact  of  project  roads  and  border \ncrossings. Of these, 677 houses and 513 small businesses and shops will be displaced, and 680 \nhouseholds will be severely affected by loss of productive assets. In Cambodia, 337 households \nwill be affected by the Project. It will require relocation of 83 houses and 58 small businesses and \nshops. Eight households will lose their entire total productive landholdings because of expansion \nof border facilities. The resettlement plans incorporate special actions to address the needs of \nethnic  minorities  and  are  consistent  with  the  project  gender  strategy.  A  summary  of  the \nresettlement plans is in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n30.

Financing Plan \n31.  It is proposed that ADB will provide a loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia of $7 million \nequivalent and a loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam of $75 million equivalent. The loans \nwill be denominated in special drawing rights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with terms of \n32 years and grace periods of 8 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace periods and 1.5% per annum thereafter. It is further proposed that the Government of \nAustralia, through the Australian Agency for International Development, provide a grant to the \n ", "    9 \nKingdom of Cambodia of 8.0 million equivalent and a grant to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nof $25.5 million equivalent in joint cofinancing for consulting services and civil works.11 It is also \nproposed that the Government of the Republic of Korea, through the Economic Development \nCooperation Fund of Korea, will provide a loan of about $50.0 million equivalent to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for consulting services and civil works to construct the Tac Cau Bypass. The \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea loan will be denominated in won and have a term of 30 \nyears including a grace period of 10 years. There will be an interest charge of 1% per annum \ncharged throughout the term of the loan and a service charge of 0.1% on the amount of each \ndisbursement. Repayments will be in semiannual installments after the grace period. Government \nof the Republic of Korea financing will be tied and made available as parallel cofinancing. The \nGovernment of Cambodia will contribute about $3.7 million equivalent (about 20% of total costs \nfor the Cambodian component) which will cover land acquisition and resettlement, independent \nmonitoring of the resettlement plan provisions, a portion of project management costs, a portion of \ncontingencies, a portion of civil works costs, and all taxes and duties. Of MPWT\u2019s recurrent \nproject administration costs, ADB loan funds will be applied to the following items when costs are \nincurred  for  project-related  activities:  vehicle  operation  and  maintenance;  international  and \ndomestic travel, per diems, and  allowances; communications; and miscellaneous office supplies. \nThe Government of Viet Nam will contribute about $58.2 million equivalent (about 28% of total \ncosts  for  the  Vietnamese  component)  which  will  cover  land  acquisition  and  resettlement, \nunexploded ordnance clearance,12 independent monitoring of the resettlement plan provisions, \nproject management costs, local currency contingencies, and all taxes and duties.

The conditions and arrangements for the application of the trust funds to the \nProject will also be (i) documented through an exchange of letters between the Government of \nAustralia and the Government of Cambodia, and (ii) through a grant14 agreement between ADB \nand the Government of Viet Nam. Conditions and arrangements for Government of the Republic \nof Korea cofinancing will be a through bilateral financing agreement to be negotiated between the \nGovernment  of  Viet Nam  and  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea.  Operational \narrangements for cofinancing arrangements between ADB and Government of the Republic of \nKorea  will  be  based  on  the  memorandum  of  understanding  on  Establishing  Operational \nArrangements between ADB and Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) signed on 14 December \n2005. KEXIM is the Republic of Korea government agency responsible for the administration of \nthe Economic Development Cooperation Fund. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  Cambodia. MPWT will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project with responsibility for \nprocurement, withdrawal of loan proceeds, engagement and direction of consultants, acting as \nEmployer  on  all  works  contracts,  and  reporting  to  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Australia. \nResponsibilities for planning and implementation will be delegated to Project Management Unit \nNo. 3 (PMU-3), under the General Department of Public Works (GDPW), as the implementation \nagency (IA) for the Project. The proposed project organization and implementation arrangements \nare  in  Appendix  7.  MPWT  and  PMU-3  have  experience  of  ADB  requirements  during \nimplementation of ADB-funded projects and have performed satisfactorily on previous projects. \nPMU-3 will ensure that the Kampot PDPWT establishes a provincial resettlement committee as \nwell  as  district  resettlement  working  groups  and  commune  resettlement  task  forces  to  be \nresponsible for preparation and implementation of the resettlement plan. GDPW will ensure that \nan updated resettlement plan is prepared prior to any award of civil works contracts. The Kampot \nand Kep PDPWTs will coordinate with the Provincial Committees for the Control of AIDS to \nimplement the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program with assistance from \nthe consultant engaged under the project implementation consulting services package. This plan \nwill supplement government programs for prevention and complement other donor initiatives. \nPMU-3 will make equivalent arrangements as needed with regard to improvements of the Koh \nKong  border  facility.  PMU-3  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) in the design and construction stages. EMP requirements \nwill be incorporated into the construction documents; monitoring and enforcement will be ensured \nby PMU-3 with the assistance of the project implementation consultant. EMP requirements during \noperations will be monitored by the Social and Environmental Unit, Department of Planning (or \nOffice  of  Social  and  Environmental  Safeguard,  General  Department  of  Planning  and \nAdministrative Services, after MPWT reorganization), MPWT. IRC will recruit an independent \nresettlement monitor (IRM) to monitor implementation of the resettlement plans. The IRM will be \nengaged prior to initiation of resettlement activities. \n \n35.  Within 3 months of the completion of rehabilitating and upgrading NR33 from Kampong \nTrach to Preak Chek, MPWT will assign responsibility for operations and maintenance to Kampot \nand Kep PDPWTs which already have responsibility for the major national highways in the project \narea.   \n \n                                                 \n14 Government procedures require that loan and grant agreements be drawn up for use in Viet Nam. \n ", "    11 \n36.  Viet  Nam.  VRA  will  be  the  EA  for  the  Project.  Responsibility  for  planning  and \nimplementation will be delegated to My Thuan Project Management Unit (PMU-MT), which will be \nengaged  under  an  agreement  with  VRA  to  undertake  the  duties  of  the  IA  for  the  Project. \nConsultants and contractors will be procured separately for the ADB and Government of Australia \nfinanced section, and for the Republic of Korea-financed section. The IA will engage, direct, and \ncoordinate the work of all consultants; be responsible for procurement; and be the Employer on all \ncivil works contracts. The IA will be delegated all necessary legal authority to undertake the above \ntasks. PMU-MT has experience of ADB requirements during the implementation of ADB-funded \nprojects and performed satisfactorily on previous projects. The Government of Viet Nam will \nensure that Kien Giang and Ca Mau PPC establish provincial resettlement committees (if needed, \nbased on Project needs) as well as district compensation, assistance, and resettlement boards \nand commune resettlement task forces to be responsible for the preparation and implementation \nof the resettlement plans. PMU-MT will ensure that an updated resettlement plan is prepared prior \nto any award of civil works contracts. The PPCs will also direct provincial government agencies to \nimplement the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program with assistance from \nthe ADB detailed design and implementation services (DDIS) component consultant. VRA will \nhave overall responsibility for implementation of the EMP in the design and construction stages. \nEMP  requirements  will  be  incorporated  into  the  construction  documents;  monitoring  and \nenforcement will be ensured by the project implementation consultant and Republic of Korea \nsupervision consultant. EMP requirements during operations will be implemented by PMU-MT, \nwith monitoring by the Provincial Departments of Natural Resources and the Environment. The \nPMU-MT will recruit an IRM to monitor implementation of the resettlement plans. The IRM will be \nengaged prior to initiation of resettlement activities. \n \n37.  Upon completion of the project roads, VRA will assign responsibility for operation and \nmaintenance to its subsidiary operational agency, Regional Road Management Unit No. 7, which \nalready has responsibility for the major national highways in the project area. MOT will reclassify \nprovincial  road  (TL)  7  as  a  QL  on  completion  of  rehabilitation  and  improvements,  and \nresponsibility for the operation and maintenance of this road will be transferred to VRA. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n38.  Cambodia.  Recruitment  of  the  DDIS  consultant  commenced  in  June  2007  and  this \nconsultant will start work in early 2008. Detailed designs and bid documents for upgrading NR33 \nwill be completed by late 2008, enabling procurement to be completed and construction to start in \nmid 2009. It is estimated that a construction period of 18 months will be required, with completion \nby the end of 2010. The DDIS consultant will assist PMU-3 and Kampot PDPWT to complete \nresettlement work sufficient for award of civil works contracts by the mid of 2009. It is estimated \nthat the periodic maintenance work for NR33 from Kampong Trach to Preak Chek will require 18 \nmonths and be completed by the end of 2010. Routine maintenance work for NR31 and NR33 will \nbe undertaken for 3 years and finish by mid-2012. An outline implementation schedule for the \nCambodian component of the Project is in Appendix 8. \n \n39.  Viet  Nam.  The  DDIS  consultant  for  the  ADB  and  Government  of  Australia  funded \ncomponents (ADB DDIS consultant) for the Project will be recruited and will start work by late \n2008. For the first civil works contract, detailed designs and bid documents will be completed by \nlate 2009, enabling procurement to be completed and construction to start by early 2010. The \nconsultant will assist PMU-MT and the districts in Ca Mau and Kien Giang provinces to complete \nresettlement work sufficient for award of civil works contracts by early 2010. Construction of the \nADB  and  Government  of  Australia  funded  civil  works  will  be  completed  by  end  2013.  The \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea funded DDIS component consultant will begin work in late \n2008 at the same time as the ADB DDIS consultant, and complete the detailed designs by the late \n ", "12   \n2009.  This  will  enable  the  ADB  DDIS  consultant  to  complete  the  resettlement  work  on  the \nRepublic of Korea section in parallel with the ADB and Government of Australia section by the \nend of 2009 sufficient for construction work to commence. Construction on the Republic of Korea \nsection is planned to begin in early 2010 and be completed by the end of 2013. An outline \nimplementation schedule for the Vietnamese component of the Project is presented in Appendix \n8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n40.  Procurement of all ADB and Government of Australia financed works will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement plans15 \nand details of proposed contract packages for the Project are in Appendix 9. Approval for advance \nprocurement action for civil works has not been requested as preparation of civil works bidding \ndocuments  can  only  commence  after  the  DDIS  consultants  have  commenced  work,  these \nservices can only begin after loan effectiveness. IAs in both Cambodia (PMU-3) and Viet Nam \n(PMU-MT)  are  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  requirements,  and  they  have  performed \nsatisfactorily under previous ADB-funded projects. \n \n41.  Cambodia. Separate civil works contracts will be procured for (i) improvement of NR33 \nbetween the border with Viet Nam at Preak Chak and Kampong Trach; (ii) cross-border facilities \nat Preak Chak; (iii) cross-border facilities at Koh Kong, and (iv) replacement of bridges and \nculverts along the Kampong Trach\u2013Kampot road section. These contracts will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Civil works under the maintenance component \nwill be suitably packaged through a number of contracts, where contracts costing more than \n$100,000 and less than $1 million may follow national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nacceptable to ADB. For procurement under both ICB and NCB procedures, post-qualification will \nbe  used  to  confirm  that  contractors  have  adequate  technical  and  financial  capabilities.  All \ncontracts procured under ICB procedures and contracts for consulting services will be subject to \nprior review by ADB, unless otherwise agreed between the Government of Cambodia and ADB \nand set forth in the procurement plan. Documentation for the first contract procured under NCB \nwill be subject to prior review by ADB; thereafter, post-review will be required unless otherwise \nagreed.  NCB  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  Cambodia\u2019s  public  procurement  law, \nmodified or clarified as necessary to ensure consistency with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Any \nnecessary  modifications  or  clarifications  will  be  reflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  The \nGovernment of Cambodia will use its own resources for financing the resettlement component of \nthe Project, so procurement for these services and goods will be undertaken using government \nprocurement procedures. All procurement will be managed by GDPW with assistance from the \nDDIS consultants. \n \n42.  Viet Nam. All procurement will be managed by the IA with assistance from the DDIS \nconsultants. For the ADB and Government of Australia funded components, there will be two \nmajor civil works contracts (one each for the An Minh Bypass\u2013Nga Bac Canal, and the Nga Bac \nCanal\u2013Industrial  Complex  sections)  to  be  procured  using  ADB\u2019s  ICB  procedures  with \nprequalification; documentation will be subject to prior review. Other smaller civil works contracts \npartly or wholly financed by ADB and costing more than $100,000 and less than $2 million may \nfollow NCB procedures acceptable to ADB. Documentation for the first contract procured under \nNCB procedures will be subject to prior review; thereafter, post-review will be required. NCB shall \nbe carried out in accordance with Viet Nam\u2019s public procurement law, modified or clarified as \nnecessary  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary \nmodifications or clarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. The Government of Viet \n                                                 \n15 The Borrowers have submitted procurement plans for the next 18 months for ADB\u2019s approval. These will be updated \nannually or as necessary. \n ", "    13 \nNam will use its own resources for financing the resettlement component of the Project, so \nprocurement for services and goods under this component will be undertaken using government \nprocurement procedures. \n \n43.  Procurement  of  civil  works  under  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  funded \ncomponent will be subject to Republic of Korea procurement guidelines and procedures.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  For all ADB and Government of Australia financed consulting services, international and \nnational consultants will be recruited through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and will use ADB\u2019s quality and cost-\nbased recruitment procedures. Full technical proposals will be required: to calculate the firms\u2019 \ntotal scores, technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and financial proposals will be \ngiven a weight of 20%. Both governments have requested approval of advance contracting action \nfor consulting services. They have been advised that approval does not commit ADB to finance \nthe ensuing Project. Details of contract packages and procurement procedures are in Appendix 9. \nSummary terms of references for the detailed design and construction supervision consulting \nservices are in Appendix 10. A more detailed outline of the terms of reference is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. IAs in both Cambodia (PMU-3 and IRC) and Viet Nam (PMU-MT) are familiar with \nADB procurement requirements, and they have performed satisfactorily under previous ADB-\nfunded projects. \n \n45.  Cambodia. Consultants for the Cambodian component of the Project will be recruited \nunder two packages. A firm of consultants will be recruited to undertake the DDIS services under \na contract to be financed using Government of Australia grant funds. For this contract, about 409 \nperson-months of input will be required (about 47 person-months from international experts and \nabout  362  of  national  experts).  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project  management, \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  surveying,  quantity  surveying,  materials,  and  project \nmanagement  systems;  highway,  bridge  (including  hydrology  and  drainage  engineering),  and \npavement  design;  environmental  impact  management,  social  impact  (including  social \ndevelopment, gender, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking), and resettlement planning; architecture \nand electrical and mechanical engineering; maintenance planning and economics; road safety \nawareness  and  audits;  and  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Kampot  PDPWT  will  direct \nprovincial  government  agencies  to  implement  the  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness  and \nprevention program with assistance from the DDIS consultant. \n \n46.  IRC will recruit an IRM to monitor implementation of the resettlement plans. The terms of \nreference for the IRM will also include monitoring of the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and \nprevention program. The IRM will be a national company with experience in resettlement planning \nand  social  analysis  on  similar  internationally  funded  infrastructure  projects.  Government  of \nCambodia counterpart funds will be applied to these services and recruitment will be under \nGovernment of Cambodia procedures. \n \n47.  Viet Nam. Consultants will be recruited under three separate packages. Under the ADB \nand Government of Australia funded components, one package (ADB DDIS package) will cover \ndetailed design and construction supervision of the ADB and Government of Australia funded \nsection, and the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program. It is proposed that \nthis package be funded from Government of Australia grant funds. For this contract, about 1,643 \nperson-months  of  input  will  be  required  (about  137  person-months  international  and  1,506 \nnational). The consultants will have expertise in project management, procurement, construction \nsupervision,  surveying,  quantity  surveying,  materials,  transport  planning  and  economics, and \n ", "14   \nproject management systems; highway, bridge (including hydrology and drainage engineering), \nand  pavement  design;  environmental  impact  management,  social  impact  (including  social \ndevelopment, gender, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking), and resettlement planning; architecture \nand electrical and mechanical engineering; maintenance planning and economics; road safety \nawareness and audits; and project monitoring and evaluation. Under the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea funded component, a single package will be prepared for the Government of \nthe Republic of Korea DDIS services with recruitment following Republic of Korea procedures. For \nthis contract, about 1,348 person-months of input will be required (about 109 person-months \ninternational and 1,239 national). The consultants will have expertise in project management, \nprocurement,  construction  supervision,  surveying,  quantity  surveying,  materials,  and  project \nmanagement  systems;  highway,  bridge  (including  hydrology  and  drainage  engineering),  and \npavement design; and environmental impact management. The Ca Mau and Kien Giang PPCs \nwill direct provincial government agencies to implement the HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness \nand prevention program with assistance from the ADB DDIS consultant. \n \n48.  PMU-MT will recruit an IRM to monitor implementation of the resettlement plans. The \nterms  of  reference  for  the  IRM  will  also  include  monitoring  of  the  HIV/AIDS  and  trafficking \nawareness and prevention program. This IRM will be a national company with experience in \nresettlement planning and social analysis on similar internationally funded infrastructure projects. \nGovernment of Viet Nam counterpart funds will be applied to these services and recruitment will \nbe under Government of Viet Nam procedures. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the governments and EAs in both Cambodia and Viet Nam. Consistent with its commitment \nto good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n50.  To promote transparency and good governance, project-specific websites will be set up to \ncover the Cambodia and Viet Nam components of the Project. These websites will include copies \nof all project-related documents, including information on how project funds are being used. \nAccess to this websites will be made available to the public. MPWT and VRA16 will publicly \ndisclose  on  their  websites  information  on  how  loan  proceeds  are  being  used,  presenting \nprocurement contract awards, including for each such contract: (i) the list of participating bidders, \n(ii) name of the winning bidder, (iii) basic details on bidding procedures adopted, (iv) amount of \nthe contract awarded, (v) list of goods and/or services purchased, and (vi) intended and actual \nutilization of loan proceeds under each contract. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  Cambodia. Two imprest accounts\u2014one for ADB loan funds and another for Government \nof Australia grant funds\u2014will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and the detailed \narrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \n                                                 \n16 VRA will use the website maintained by the Ministry of Planning and Investment for the disclosure of procurement \ninformation. \n ", "    15 \nthe  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated  expenditures  for  6  months  or  10%  of  the \nloan/grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  accounts  will  be  established  with  a  reputable \ncommercial bank acceptable to both the Government of Cambodia and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditures procedure will be followed for reimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation \nof each imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. Loan disbursements for \ncivil works (procured under ICB) and consulting services will utilize the direct payment procedures \ndefined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n52.  Viet Nam. Two imprest accounts\u2014one for ADB loan funds and another for Government of \nAustralia grant funds\u2014will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and the detailed arrangements agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will be based on \nestimated expenditures for 6 months or 10% of the loan/grant amount, whichever is lower. The \naccounts  will  be  established  with  a  reputable  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  both  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be followed \nfor reimbursement of expenditures and for the liquidation of each imprest account for individual \npayments not exceeding $100,000. Loan disbursements for civil works (procured under ICB) and \nconsulting  services  will  utilized  the  direct  payment  procedures  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. \n \n53.  Arrangements for disbursement of funds made available from the Government of the \nRepublic of Korea loan will follow Republic of Korea procedures. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n54.  The project IAs in Cambodia (PMU-3) and Viet Nam (PMU-MT) will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the proceeds of \nthe project loans and grants, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the Project, \nan audit of resettlement expenditures, and use of local funds. Within 6 months of the close of the \neach year, each government will submit audited annual project accounts to ADB, which provide a \ndetailed description of the source of funds and expenditures made. Annual project accounts will \nbe audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB, and the auditor\u2019s terms of reference will be approved \nby ADB before commencement of work. The annual audit will include an audit opinion on the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures procedure operations. The audit results will be \nsubmitted to ADB, Government of Australia, and KEXIM annually. \n \n55.  Regular  progress  reports  on  the  Project  will  be  prepared  by  the  DDIS  consultants, \nreviewed by the IAs, and submitted by the IAs to ADB and Government of Australia every quarter. \nIn Viet Nam, copies of the progress reports will also be submitted to KEXIM. Progress reports will \ninclude a description of the physical progress, status of implementation of resettlement plans, \nstatus  of  work  subject  to  provisions  of  the  EMP,  procurement  and  contractual  status,  and \nhighlights of any implementation issues. The progress reports will also contain a summary of \nproject accounts, including details of the latest project expenditures and contract amounts. These \nreports will include an evaluation of progress in implementing the Project. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, the IAs will furnish to ADB and Government of Australia (in Viet \nNam, also to KEXIM) a project completion report covering details of project implementation, costs, \nand an evaluation of the Project\u2019s success in meeting performance targets. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  The project IAs, assisted by the consultants, will establish systematic project performance \nmonitoring and analysis throughout the life of the Project and integrating it with the existing \nmanagement information system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and conduct sample \n ", "16   \nsurveys to establish baseline data for subsequent performance monitoring, and will establish pre-\nproject social and economic living conditions for the direct project beneficiaries. A second survey \nwill be carried out on project completion and a third survey after a period of not less than 5 years \nafter project completion. The baseline and impact surveys will include appropriate control areas \nand will assess all interventions under the Project, including resettlement and other safeguard \ninterventions that affect the livelihood of project beneficiaries. In addition, a set of indicators \nreflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility will be developed to assess the effects of improved \naccess to the area. District indicators will include agricultural productivity, economic activity, and \nhealth and education indicators. The impacts of development on the poor resulting from improved \nroad access will receive particular attention. \n \n9.  Project Review \n57.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB and the Government of Australia, and in Viet Nam \nby KEXIM, a midterm review of project implementation will be carried out. At critical periods during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  and  EMPs,  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  and  environment \nspecialists will join the reviews. Representatives of ADB, and in Viet Nam of KEXIM, and the \ngovernments will take part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse \ncorrections. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n58.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was calculated by comparing \nthe with- and without-project scenarios for the project road. In the without-project scenario, the \nroad is assumed to receive only minimal maintenance and will continue to deteriorate. The with-\nproject scenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (footnote 14) considered various mutually exclusive \nproject alternatives, and the proposed Project is based on the most cost-effective and least-cost \noption. Without the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the capacity of the roads, which \nwould  become  congested\u2014leading  to  increases  in  travel  time  and  vehicle  operating  costs \n(VOCs). With the Project, travel time will be reduced because of higher speeds; VOCs will be \nreduced because of the faster and smoother ride on the project road. \n \n59.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance \nStandards Model. The model evaluates the project investment considering capital and recurrent \ncosts as well as the benefits derived from savings in road user costs for the with- and without-\nproject cases. In the economic analysis, the project life was taken to be 20 years. The economic \ncosts of the Project include the resource costs for construction, operation and maintenance, and \nthe social costs of compensation for land acquisition and resettlement. The economic benefits \nwere quantified in terms of VOC savings and time savings. The economic analysis subdivided the \nproject road into homogeneous sections. These sections were defined based on traffic volumes \nderived  from  the  traffic  analysis,  roughness  observed  during  the  surveys,  and  altitude  and \ngradient of the road. The EIRR was estimated separately for each country and also for the Project \nas a whole. The estimated EIRR was 14.0% for Cambodia, 16.8% for Viet Nam, and 16.7% for \nthe  Project  as  a  whole.  These  EIRRs  indicate  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable.  The \neconomic  analysis  is  summarized  in  Appendix  11  and  further  details  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n60.  The sensitivity of the project road was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit and \ncost streams. Several sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) an increase of 20% in construction \ncosts, (ii) a decrease of 20% in benefits, (iii) a decrease of 20% in the base year estimate of \n ", "    17 \ntraffic, (iv) a decrease of 20% in traffic growth rates, (v) a reduction in generated traffic by 20%, \n(vi) no time saving benefits, and (vii) a combination of a 20% increase in capital costs and a 20% \nreduction of benefits. The results show that the quantified economic benefits are quite robust to \nthe various sensitivity tests and the project remains economically viable. Switching values were \ndetermined for capital costs and economic benefits. The capital cost would have to increase by \n56% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. The benefit level would have to decrease by 36% to achieve the \nsame effect on the EIRR. The estimate of the benefits from generated traffic would have to fall by \n77% for the EIRR to fall to 12%. Further to the sensitivity tests, a risk analysis was undertaken to \ndetermine the probability of the EIRR falling below 12%, the opportunity cost of capital, and \neconomic viability. The risk analysis used the @Risk computer program. The results from the risk \nanalysis indicated that the probability of the EIRR for the Project falling below 12% is only 10.6%. \nThe risk analysis is described as part of the summary of the economic analysis in Appendix 11. A \nfull description of the methodology and assumptions used in the risk analysis is in Supplementary \nAppendix B.    \n \n61.  The population of the project area is 1.526 million with about 94% living in Viet Nam. \nOverall, the project area has a poverty rate of 27.5%, as measured by the Project Road User \nSurvey. The total number of households below the poverty line in the Viet Nam project area was \n23.1%  compared  to  64.1%  in  Cambodia;  both  rates  are  above  the  respective  national  and \nprovincial averages. Although the poverty rate is much lower in Viet Nam, poor households in the \nproject area represent over 43% of the total poor in the two Vietnamese provinces. The Project\u2019s \neconomic benefits are primarily derived from VOC savings and travel time savings that will accrue \nprimarily from improvements in road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, and increased \naverage speed in some sections. Both poor and nonpoor residents are heavy road users, with \nover 86% of people living in the project area using the roads daily or several times a week. \nVehicle ownership by the poor accounts for 15.0% of motorized vehicles; the poor\u2019s share of \npublic passenger transport usage is 34.3% and the share of public freight transport usage is \n23.1%. A distribution analysis was undertaken to assess the extent that the direct economic \nbenefits quantified in the economic analysis would accrue to poor people; and to estimate the \npoverty impact ratio (PIR) for the Cambodia section, Viet Nam section, and the Project as a \nwhole. Initially, estimates were prepared of the distribution of the quantified benefits among the \nvarious categories of road users (bus and truck operators/owners; bus passengers; car, utility and \nmotorcycle owners, drivers, and passengers; and bicycle and animal drawn vehicle users). The \ndistributional analysis indicates a PIR of 0.38 for the Project as a whole, which indicates a \nsubstantial net transfer of resources from the economy as a whole to the poor in the project area. \nThe PIR provides a strong indication that the Project is highly pro-poor. Other benefits will also \naccrue to the poor but have not been quantified in the analysis, including improvements in access \nto (i) nonfarm employment opportunities, which will help reduce dependency on subsistence \nagriculture and seasonal labor; (ii) health facilities and medication, which will reduce the risk and \nseverity of health hazards; and (iii) education, which increases the chances that the young can \nimprove their future earnings potential. The ability of the public sector to provide these services \nefficiently will be enhanced by better road access.  \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n62.  Social and Gender. The Project has been formulated to minimize potential risk. Project \nimpacts were assessed along with potential associated risks. The road improvements will lead to \nlower transport costs and improved access of the poor to markets and social services. Farmers \nwill benefit from lower input price because of lower freight rates. Both poor and nonpoor will \nbenefit from lower costs of using their own motorized vehicles and reduced travel time. These \nbenefits will be not only in economic activities but also in improved access to schools, medical \nfacilities, and other social services. The ability of the public sector to provide these services in a \n ", "18   \nmore cost-effective way could be increased because of improved access. The improved roads \nand open border between Viet Nam and Cambodia will boost development in the tourism sector. \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  economic  growth,  which  may  expand  economic  opportunities \navailable to the poor. Improved roads will create new opportunities for women in the areas of jobs \nand small businesses, and better access to social services. However, the extent to which women \ncan take advantage of these opportunities depends on economic, social, and cultural factors. \nProject  impacts  also  relate  to  (i)  displacement  of  local  economic  activities  because  of  land \nacquisition; (ii) loss of productive land; (iii) displacement of local activities for transport of goods \nfrom the border to markets by large commercial vehicles; (iv) increased traffic risks for people \nliving and working along road because of large volumes of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along \nthe improved road; (v) increased risks of exposure to HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and \nchildren during construction activities and because of large volumes of transit traffic along the \nroad and border area; and (vi) increased flow of illegal drugs and number of drug users in the \nproject area because of improved access. Details of impacts are in the summary of poverty and \nsocial strategy in Appendix 12.   \n \n63.  Ethnic Minorities. There are no ethnic minority people in the project area in Cambodia. In \nthe Viet Nam project area, Khmer ethnic minority groups account for about 2% of the population in \nCa Mau Province and 12% of the population in Kieng Giang Province, or about 7% in the project \narea overall. In Viet Nam, ethnic minority households (Khmer) in the project area speak both \nVietnamese and Khmer (especially men). Khmer people are well integrated in the mainstream \nand maintain religious practice without interference from the Vietnamese (Kinh). Like the majority \nKinh Vietnamese, rural ethnic Khmer cultivate rice and/or engage in shrimp farming. Urban ethnic \nKhmer are shopkeepers or are engaged in nonfarm activities. Reliance on trading and small \nbusiness by Khmer is about same as the mainstream population. In both Kien Giang and Ca Mau, \nnearly all project-affected persons, including those from ethnic minorities, are classified nonpoor. \nThe Project will not affect Khmer people differently from the Vietnamese. Khmer people will \nbenefit from the economic development in the project area. The new road section in Ca Mau will \nreduce isolation for Khmer community. Near the border area of Kieng Giang, increased tourism \nwill benefit small businesses run by Khmer people. Since there is no differential negative impact \non ethnic minority groups than on the Kinh, an ethnic minority development plan is not required. \nTo ensure project benefits to the Khmer people, ethnic minority specific activities are included in \nthe resettlement plan, gender strategy, and HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention \nprogram.  \n \n64.  Resettlement.  The  resettlement  plans  prepared  for  the  Project  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 5, and resettlement plans have been endorsed by the respective governments and \ndisclosed to project-affected persons. The Project is designed to avoid or minimize involuntary \nresettlement wherever possible. In Viet Nam, this has been done by adjusting road alignments via \n(i) widening on the land side only to avoid the heavily built-up canal side; (ii) adjusting bridge \nalignments to avoid structures; or (iii) bypassing towns to avoid dense development, although this \nusually impacts agricultural rather than residential land. In Viet Nam, two full resettlement plans \nhave been prepared, one each for Kien Giang Province and Ca Mau Province. A total of 3,775 \nhouseholds will be affected by loss of residential, commercial, or agricultural land within the \ncorridor of impact of project roads. Of these, 680 households will be severely affected by loss of \nproductive assets, 677 houses and 513 small businesses and shops will be displaced, and 680 \nhouseholds will be severely affected by loss of productive assets. Affected households will be \ncompensated and assisted to move out of the right-of-way with all entitlements.  \n  \n65.  Resettlement impacts in Cambodia will be minimized by allowing affected persons the \noption of moving back out of the corridor of impact into the remaining right-of-way, or completely \nout of the right-of-way. Such options will give affected persons the best opportunities for avoiding \n ", "    19 \nor minimizing impacts on roadside livelihood activities, such as small shops and market stalls. \nProject-affected persons also have the option of moving right out of the right-of-way now or in the \nfuture, with all entitlements. In Cambodia, 337 households will be affected by the Project. It will \nrequire the relocation of 83 houses and 58 small businesses and shops. Eight households will \nlose their entire total productive landholdings because of the expansion of border facilities. A full \nresettlement plan has been prepared for Cambodia.  \n \n66.  Environment. The project corridor in southern Cambodia contains no designated forest, \nwildlife, or rare and endangered species or habitats. Vehicle related air and noise pollution is not a \nserious problem along the corridor. However, during dry seasons, laterite dust from passing \nvehicles creates serious dust clouds\u2014affecting the quality of life for all living along the roadway \nand up to 75 m on either side. Paving the road and shoulders will eliminate this problem. During \nconstruction, a watering schedule will be required to minimize the temporary impact on air quality \nof dust generated by construction activities. A potential impact during operation at the Preak \nChak\u2013Xa Xia and Koh Kong border crossings will be the wastewater and solid wastes generated \nat the customs and immigration facility, if these wastes are not managed properly. A primary \nwaste treatment facility will be designed and installed to service the new buildings to minimize the \npotential impacts. Garbage will be managed by contracting a local worker to collect and dispose \nof solid waste. It is assessed that most of the potential impacts of the Cambodian section are \nduring the construction stage; these are of a nature temporary and can be managed effectively by \nmitigation  measures.  An  EMP  and  monitoring  program  have  been  prepared  and  will  be \nimplemented by MPWT during the construction and operation periods. Appropriate clauses will be \nincluded  in  civil  works  contracts  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  EMP.  Separate  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  have  been  prepared  for  the  Cambodian  and  Vietnamese \nproject  components.  These  IEEs  have  been  summarized  in  a  single  project  summary  IEE \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n67.  The project corridor in southern Viet Nam lies in the Mekong Delta, which has a dense \nnetwork of waterways and navigable canals. There are two ecologically sensitive sites in the \nregion,  which  were  identified  by  BirdLife  International  in  Indochina  as  important  habitats for \nendangered birds and mammals. However, the project corridor is far from the two sites and none \nof the project activities would affect these sites. Major environmental concerns of the Project in \nthe Vietnamese section are the interference of ship traffic caused by poor design of bridges and \nwater quality because of disturbance of acid sulphate soils in localized areas. The EA will ensure \nthe bridge designs allow sufficient navigation clearances. It will also secure accurate acid sulphate \nsoil maps and make them available for contractors. Construction procedures in such areas will \nfollow guidance from Can Tho University to minimize the potential impacts of acid soil on water \nquality and surrounding aquaculture activities. It is assessed that most of the potential impacts of \nthe Viet Nam section are during the construction stage; these are of a nature temporary and can \nbe managed effectively by mitigation measures. An EMP and monitoring program have been \nprepared, and will be implemented by PMU-MT during construction and by VRA during operation \nperiods. Appropriate clauses will be included in civil works contracts to ensure implementation of \nthe EMP. \n \nC.  Project Risks \n68.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  reduce  potential  risks,  which  include  delays  in \nimplementation because of inadequate implementation capacity of MPWT in Cambodia and VRA \nin Viet Nam, failure to provide counterpart financing on time, the traffic forecast not being realized, \nand inadequate road maintenance. The Project includes a number of measures to mitigate the \nrisk of delays. Approval for advance contracting action for recruitment of consultants has been \nrequested. The EAs are familiar with ADB procedures and will be able to make full use of the \n ", "20   \nadvance action provisions. The governments have been made aware of ADB\u2019s emphasis on the \ntimely provision of counterpart funds, and have assured the project processing missions that they \ncan provide the necessary funds for all ongoing ADB-financed road projects on time. In Cambodia \nthere is a risk of corruption and fraud in the procurement process; therefore measures have been \nincluded in the Project design to strengthen the integrity of the procurement process. Project \nspecific web pages will be established in both Cambodia and Viet Nam and information will be \npublicly disclosed on these web pages on how Loan proceeds are being used together with \nspecific procurement information on each contract. Other risks include lower-than-expected traffic, \nespecially  generated  traffic.  This  has  been  mitigated  by  using  conservative  assumptions  to \nestimate benefits in the economic analysis, and undertaking sensitivity analyses that included \nreducing traffic growth forecasts by 20% and reducing the estimate of generated traffic by 50%. In \naddition, a risk analysis was undertaken to determine the probability of the EIRR falling below \n12%, the opportunity cost of capital, and the indicator of economic viability. These analyses \nshowed that the overall Project remained robustly viable. There is also a risk that the project \nroads will not be properly maintained and thus the full benefits of the Project will not be realized, \nthis risk is addressed in paragraph 69. To address risks arising from road safety, the Project \nincludes both road safety audits and road safety awareness campaigns in both Cambodia and \nViet Nam to be undertaken by project-funded consultants. To address the risk of overloaded \ntrucks, the new border facilities at Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia and Koh Kong will be equipped with \nweighing facilities. \n \n69.  Sustainability.  Available  funds  currently  cover  about  50%  of  road  maintenance \nrequirements in Viet Nam. As Viet Nam maintains ADB-financed roads in accordance with the \nloan covenants, this would imply that other parts of the road network are neglected. The problem \nis that infrastructure development is needed to enable economic growth but initial utilization of the \ninfrastructure is light, which curtails the scope for financing from user charges. Funding from the \nGovernment\u2019s general tax revenue is equally constrained. The funding problem will be temporary \nand will last until economic growth increases general tax revenues and the number of transport \nusers. Based on current trends, Viet Nam is likely to reach breakeven with respect to road \nmaintenance funding in about 10 years. Thus, adequate funds should be available by the time \nmajor maintenance is required for the project roads. The World Bank is undertaking a road \nmaintenance financing study to review the scope for reducing the time frame until breakeven, and \nidentify supplementary funding until it is attained. Given the above assessment, the Vietnamese \ncomponent of the Project is considered sustainable. \n \n70.  The Government of Cambodia has not complied with a number of loan covenants under \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion: Cambodia Road Improvement Project (footnote 3), including \ncovenants addressing road maintenance and the reorganization of MPWT. Progress is now being \nmade  towards  meeting  these  covenants  (para. 6.).  To  continue  the  progress  made,  the \nGovernment of Cambodia has agreed to a condition for loan effectiveness that, based on the \n2007  annual  maintenance  plan  and  budget,  MEF  must  have  disbursed  an  interim  second \npayment amounting to 30% of the annual budget to the PDPWTs. The first payment was made as \na condition for loan appraisal. However, the risk of noncompliance with loan covenants remains. \nDespite this risk, it is proposed that the GMS-SCC Project include the proposed Cambodian \ncomponent as (i) the Kampong Trach\u2013Preak Chak section of NR33 to be improved under the \nProject is only 15 km long, so the increase in the overall length of improved road within the \nCambodian  road  network  is  small;  and  (ii)  part  of  the  rationale  for  the  investments  in  the \nVietnamese component is the assumption that the GMS-SCC will be completed in Cambodia, \ngiving access from Viet Nam through to Thailand. Further, the proposed RAMP (para. 6.) will \naddress the long-term sustainability of the MPWT road network. Based on the above assessment, \nthe Cambodian component of the Project is considered sustainable. \n \n ", "    21 \n71.   Project  Implementation.  Resettlement  can  lead  to  impoverishment  if  adequate \ncompensation and rehabilitation assistance is not provided to enable affected households to \nreplace their losses and restore their livelihoods. The resettlement plans include capacity building \ntraining for the affected households17 to increase their understanding of resettlement activities; \nentitlements to compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation; and rights to grievance redress. \nThe increased knowledge of men and women from affected households will facilitate their access \nto fair compensation and other entitlements, and reduce the risk of impoverishment. To address \nthe increased risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS during construction activities and the potential for \nincreased trafficking of women and children because of large volumes of transit traffic along the \nGMS-SCC and the border area, the Project includes a HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and \nprevention campaign. \n \nV.

Introduction \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) comprises Cambodia, Yunnan Province and \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People's \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  Myanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  In  1992,  with  the \nassistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the six countries entered into a program of \nsubregional  economic  cooperation.  The  ultimate  objective  of  the  program  is  to  facilitate \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  to  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  the  people  in  the \nsubregion. The program has contributed to the development of infrastructure to enable the \ndevelopment and sharing of the resource base, and to promote the freer flow of goods and \npeople in the subregion. ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update for the \nGMS1 includes four strategic pillars, the first of which addresses strengthening connectivity and \nfacilitating cross-border movement and tourism. The high priority given to cooperation in the \ntransport sector is because of the poor state of the transport infrastructure in most of the GMS, \nwhich is a major constraint to economic growth, trade, and other forms of cooperation. The \nmovement of both freight and passenger traffic through the GMS traffic is dominated by road. \nAlthough subregional traffic is still modest, the governments of the GMS countries\u2014particularly \nCambodia and Viet Nam\u2014give high priority to the development of transport infrastructure links \nthat will facilitate regional and international trade and economic cooperation, especially when \nsuch transport facilities also serve their respective domestic needs. In addition, the elimination \nof nonphysical barriers (regulations covering cross-border movements) to the movement of \npeople and goods in the subregion is important to strengthen linkages among GMS countries.  \n \n2.  The  main  thrusts  of  regional  cooperation  in  the  transport  sector  have  been: \n(i) developing the north\u2013south corridor between Kunming in Yunnan Province of the PRC to \nHo Chi Minh City in the southern part of Viet Nam, and the east\u2013west corridor from Thailand \nand the central coast of Viet Nam through Lao PDR; (ii) linking the capitals, other population \ncenters, and major tourist destinations in the subregion; (iii) helping develop remote and low-\nincome areas traversed by subregional road projects by improving access to markets, and \nsocial and economic services; (iv) providing access to the sea for landlocked Lao PDR, and \nalternative access to seaports for such areas as northeastern Thailand and Yunnan Province; \nand (v) reducing, with the objective of eliminating, nonphysical barriers (such as regulations \ncovering border crossings) to the movement of people and goods in the subregion.  \n \nB.  GMS Transport Sector Strategy \n3.  The  GMS  transport  sector  strategy  provides  an  overarching  framework  that  is \nimplemented through individual national strategies that often also involve subregional plans and \nagencies. Thus, each GMS member country has its own transport program developed for five-\nyear plans and as a basis for year-to-year budgets. These programs are supported to varying \ndegrees with sector policy statements, strategies, objectives, priorities, and individual project \nanalyses.  The  programs  incorporate  consideration  of  the  importance  of  undertaking  GMS-\nrelated projects. While there are many regional and subregional cooperation groupings involved \nin transport in the GMS, the GMS framework allows initiatives to be endorsed at the highest \nlevels of leadership. The GMS concept has rapidly established itself as an effective forum for \ninternational cooperation from the working level to the heads of government level. This has \nprovided the GMS with a leading role in coordinating projects and in developing strategy.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Beyond Borders. The Greater Mekong Subregion Subregional Cooperation Strategy and Program \nUpdate, 2007\u20132009. Manila. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \n4.  Formulation of the GMS transport sector strategy for the period to 2015 took account of \nthe need for the following.  \n \n(i)  Sectoral focus that identifies factors critical to intra-regional and transit trade \nand improved competitiveness (e.g., missing links in the transport network and \ncritical  common  needs  such  as  maintenance,  logistics,  and  multimodal \nintegration) and that are complementary to interregional and global trade.  \n(ii)  Comprehensive  inter-sectoral  strategy  that  identifies  major  socioeconomic \ntrends and developments, and determines and prioritizes transport initiatives that \nrespond  to  these  needs;  and  that  is  a  subset  of  a  comprehensive  GMS \ndevelopment plan, and encompasses country and regional transport and related \ndevelopment strategies. \n(iii)  Goal setting and results-oriented management plan that identifies key goals \nof economic integration and regional cooperation for 2015 and beyond, and sets \nperformance indicators and prioritizes GMS transport initiatives to best realize \nthese goals, e.g., the GMS as a \u201cgrowth bridge\u201d between the PRC and India, \ncapitalizing  on  the  strategic  location  of  the  GMS,  and  the  realization  of \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \n5.  The GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study2 financed by ADB identified five overarching \ngoals for transport: (i) to exploit synergies in the GMS transport system; (ii) to move towards an \nopen market for transport services; (iii) to facilitate economic efficiency to reduce transport \ncosts;  (iv) to  complete  the  GMS  network  and  improve  links  with  South  Asia;  and  (v)  to \nencourage multi-modalism. The Project will support these objectives by completing a section of \nthe GMS network, reducing the cost of transport along the Southern Coastal Corridor (SCC) and \nfacilitating intermodal transport in the corridor. \n \nC.  Border Crossing Points and Traffic/Trade Flows \n6.  At  present,  there  are  three  main  border  crossing  points  between  Cambodia  and \nViet Nam: (i)\uf020 on national road (NH) 1 in Cambodia at Bavet/Moc Bai in Viet Nam; (ii) on NH7 in \nCambodia  via  Kampong  Cham  on  the  Mekong  River;  and  (iii)  on  NH2  in  Cambodia, \n111 kilometers (km) south of Phnom Penh via Tinh Bien to Chau Doc. \n \n7.  The Bavet/Moc Bai crossing on the direct route between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh \nCity is by far the most important in terms of expected future international trade between the two \ncountries.  At  present,  a  twice-daily  tourist  bus  service  uses  the  route.  In  total,  about \n1,000 people  pass  through  the  crossing  each  day.  Most  are  tourists,  while  others  enter \nCambodia to gamble at six casinos in Bavet that cater mostly for Vietnamese customers. The \nincrease  in  transborder  activities  at  Moc  Bai  measured  both  in  terms  of  persons/vehicles \ncrossing the border and in terms of import/export values started increasing around 2003 and \n2004, soon after completion of the ADB-funded Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway \nProject.3 The total value of trade through the Bavet/Moc Bai border post has increased by \naround  41%  per  annum  from  2003  to  2006.  The  number  of  people  crossing  the  border \nincreased from 132,012 in 2003 to 472,026 in 2006, an average increase of 53% per annum. \nThe number of vehicles crossing increased from 4,356 in 2003 to 11,406 in 2006, an average \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 1659-CAM[SF] and Loan 1660-VIE[SF]). \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nincrease of 38% per annum. Recorded flows of goods show that domestic appliances and \nclothes are the main items passing from Viet Nam to Cambodia, while electronics, wine, and \ncigarettes dominate the flow in the other direction. There are, however, significant unrecorded \ntrade flows at all three border-crossing points between the two countries. \n \n8.  Economic  diversification  through  the  development  of  industrial  parks  at  the \nBavet/Moc Bai border crossing has been considerable since the implementation of the Phnom \nPenh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project. Trang Bang Industrial Park and Moc Bai Economic \nZone are two large industrial zones in Viet Nam close to the Moc Bai border post that were \nspecifically planned and developed as a direct result of the road improvement project. Similarly, \na new industrial park has been developed and recently opened in Cambodia near the Bavet \nborder  post.  These  industrial  parks  have  reinforced  the  increase  in  trade  flows  between \nCambodia and Viet Nam.  \n \nD.  The Project Road \n9.  The Transport Sector Strategy Study refined previously identified strategic transport \ncorridors in the GMS, with nine corridors now used to guide planning of transport infrastructure \nand services in the region. Of particular note for the current project is the Southern Economic \nCorridor, which links central Thailand with Cambodia and southern Viet Nam. The SCC links \nBangkok, in Thailand, with Nam Can, in Viet Nam, by a 924 km road. This road runs along the \nGulf of Thailand through Koh Kong and Kampot provinces in Cambodia and Kien Giang and \nCa Mau provinces in Viet Nam. At present, formal commercial transport is not permitted to use \nthe border crossing between Cambodia and Viet Nam on the SCC, and some sections of the \nroad provide limited accessibility because of poor road quality, limited road width, and bridges \nthat can be narrow and have low load capacity. The Project covers a 53 km section of the SCC \nin Cambodia and about 96.1 km of the SCC in Viet Nam. Once the Project is completed for the \nfirst time, it will be possible for the SCC to be used as a continuous and reliable road corridor. \nThe impact of the GMS-SCC Project will be to contribute towards economic diversification and \ndevelopment along the SCC through the reduction of transport costs and improved access for \nthe movement of goods and people between the countries in the GMS, in particular Cambodia, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n10.  With  the  implementation  of  the  project  road,  a  fourth  border  crossing  point  will  be \nestablished at the southern end of the border between Cambodia and Viet Nam at Preak Chak\u2013\nXa Xia.4 This will allow additional cross-border traffic flows for both passenger and freight traffic, \nas well as the possibility of diverted traffic (e.g., an informal taxi service is currently in operation \nbetween Chau Doc and Kampot). While the likely scale of the flow through the additional \ncrossing is difficult to quantify with precision, because of the absence of a current formal \ncrossing, taking account of regional population and industrial output suggests that future flows \nthrough the Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia crossing could be 10\u201330% of the concurrent traffic flows using \nthe Bavet\u2013Moc Bai crossing on the road linking Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. Traffic \nmovements  at  the  latter  crossing  have  already  shown  significant  increases  since  the \nimprovements and rehabilitation of the Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City road. It is expected \nthat new industrial parks will develop at the Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia in a similar way to that which \noccurred at the Bavet\u2013Moc Bai crossing. One such zone is already under construction close to \nPreak Chak. While the scale of the initial development of the zone of about 50 hectares (ha) is \nnot large, it sits within an allotment of a total area of 200 hectares and it can be expected that \nthis  industrial  zone  will  develop  further  once  the  project  road  is  developed.  New  cement \nfactories financed by PRC investors are presently in operation in Kampot province in Cambodia \n                                                 \n4  Also referred to as the Lork\u2013Xa Xia or Preak Chak\u2013Ha Tien border crossing. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nand others are planned. The existing factory is expected to produce 2 million tons of cement \nannually when fully operational. An additional factory currently under planning will add a further \n1 million tons output. With these developments, it is anticipated that Cambodia\u2019s production will \nexceed demand and that cement will be exported to Viet Nam. While much of this cement would \nbe transported by boat, it is expected that some would also be moved by road transport along \nthe project road.  \n \n11.  By  stimulating  economic  diversification  and  improving  cross-border  traffic  flows  and \nfacilities, the project road is in line with the GMS strategy and ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program Update for the GMS. As in other ADB projects linking Cambodia and \nViet Nam, the increase in subregional flows of both passengers and freight traffic has been \nincreasing steadily. The project road is envisaged to have a similar effect and to increase \nsubregional traffic flows between Cambodia and Viet Nam further.  \n \nE.  The GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement \n12.  The  GMS  governments  have  recognized  that  providing  subregional  physical \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for increased connectivity among the \nsix GMS countries. Mitigating nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and \npeople is important to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize the economic benefits of \nimproved subregional transport infrastructure. In 1996, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) 5  \nto the six GMS countries to (i) identify and assess priority transport-related cross-border issues, \n(ii)  assess  the  viability  of  existing  international  conventions  or  agreements  as  possible \n\u201csolutions\u201d or \u201cresponses\u201d to the priority issues, (iii) identify and assess issues that existing \ninternational  conventions  or  agreements  do  not  address,  and  (iv)  identify  implementation \nrequirements for addressing priority issues. The findings of the TA showed that the barriers to \ntrade and the free movement of people between GMS countries were substantial. A number of \nnonphysical  barriers  impeding  the  free  movement  of  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  across \ninternational borders in the subregion were identified, including: (i) restrictions on the entry of \nmotor vehicles, often causing costly and time-consuming transshipment; (ii) different standards \npertaining to vehicle size, weight, safety requirements, and driver qualifications; (iii) inconsistent \nand difficult formalities related to customs procedures, inspections, clearances, and assessment \nof duties; and (iv) restrictive visa requirements.  \n \n13.  Bilateral agreements on cross-border movement exist between many GMS members. \nThese agreements, however, only partly address critical cross-border facilitation issues; and \nhinder transit movement of vehicles, goods, and people to third countries. In addition, the \nbilateral agreements existing among pairs of GMS countries are not necessarily consistent with \neach other and run the risk of having gaps and overlaps, thereby making transport facilitation \neven more difficult. Therefore, a multilateral framework to facilitate the cross-border movement \nof goods and people on a subregion-wide and consistent basis is necessary to allow both \ninterstate and transit traffic. \n \n14.  The  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement  (CBTA)  is  a  multilateral  instrument \nadopted  by  all  GMS  members  to  facilitate  cross-border  transport  of  goods  and  people. \nFormulated under an ADB-funded TA,6 the CBTA provides a practical approach to streamline \nregulations and reduce nonphysical barriers in the GMS over the short to medium term, and \nincludes  measures  such  as  more  efficient  inspection  procedures  and  reciprocal  traffic \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996.

It incorporates the principles of bilateral or multilateral action, and flexibility in \nrecognizing  differences  in  procedures  in  each  of  the  GMS  countries.  The  CBTA  includes \nreferences to existing international conventions that have demonstrated their usefulness in a \nbroad range of countries. It also takes into account, and is consistent with, similar initiatives of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which five of the six GMS countries are \nmembers. In this regard, ADB consults and coordinates extensively with the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the ASEAN Secretariat to ensure \nthe consistency of the CBTA with existing international conventions and regional agreements. \nADB has also consulted with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to learn from \nits experience in promoting cross-border land transport facilitation in Europe. \n \n15.  The CBTA  became effective in December 2003 with its ratification by all six GMS \nmember countries. To achieve early results in trade and transport facilitation, the countries \nagreed to undertake the initial implementation of the CBTA at seven key border crossings from \nthe longer list of designated border crossings included in the CBTA. The SCC crosses the \nCambodia\u2013Thailand at Koh Kong and the Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam border at Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia. \nBoth of these crossings have been included in the long list. On the Cambodian side of the \nborders  at  both  Koh  Kong  and  Preak  Chak,  the  facility  for  customs  and  immigration  is \ninadequate to handle cross-border freight and passenger traffic. In anticipation of the Project, \nViet Nam has completed a new cross-border facility in Xa Xia. Development of appropriate \nfacilities for Cambodia at Koh Kong and Preak Chak, and other measures to support joint \ninspection procedures, will facilitate the application of CBTA procedures. \n \n16.  Key challenges for the effective implementation of the CBTA include: (i) establishment of \nefficient  management  systems  and  associated  capacity  building;  (ii)  streamlining  and \nharmonization of border control documents; (iii) preparation of revised manuals of operation at \nthe border checkpoints and associated training; (iv) establishment of required infrastructure, \nand, in some cases, relocation and/or modification of layouts of border checkpoints as well as \nprovision of common control areas to allow single-stop inspection and single-window inspection; \nand (v) mitigation of negative externalities associated with increased cross-border movement. \n \n17.  The major milestones for the future work on cross-border transport facilitation under the \nGMS program and their respective estimated time frame are as follows: (i) ratification by all \nGMS governments of the annexes and protocols (2004\u20132008); (ii) initial implementation of the \nCBTA and its annexes and protocols (2005\u20132007); and (iii) full implementation of the CBTA and \nits annexes and protocols (2008\u20132009).

Under  the  Viet  Nam  component,  the  Project  will  comprise \ndevelopment of stage 1 of the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor (GMS-\nSCC) Project which includes improvement of a short section of national highway (QL) 80 \nbetween the border at Xa Xia and Ha Tien, and development of the corridor between Minh \nLuong and the access road to the Khanh An Industrial Zone west of Ca Mau city. \nB.  Cambodian Component  \n1.  Road Improvement and Cross-Border Facility  \n2.  In the Cambodian component of the Project, improvement works are divided into three \nsubprojects: \n(i)  improvement of NR33 between Preak Chak and Kampong Trach (15 kilometers \n[km]); \n(ii)  repair and widening of bridges between Kampong Trach and Kampot (37 km), \nand  \n(iii)  development of new cross-border facilities at Preak Chak and Koh Kong. \n \n3.  NR33 will be improved to the required standard for a national road (i.e., 2 x 3.5 m wide \ntraffic lanes, 2 x 1.5 m wide sealed shoulders, and 2 x 0.5 m wide verges) from the steel bridge \nin the center of the Viet Nam\u2013Cambodia border neutral zone to the intersection with NR31 in \nKampong Trach. The civil works comprise widening of the existing embankment, construction of \nsubbase and base courses, and application of a double bituminous surface treatment. Drainage \nstructures will be replaced or widened as needed. The intersection with NR31 will be enlarged \nto accommodate turning traffic and improve safety. Apart from the intersection, no realignment \nis required. \n \n4.  Sections of NR33 between Kampong Trach and Kampot have been improved under the \nWorld Bank Flood Rehabilitation Project. Two of the existing Bailey bridges are to be replaced\u2014\nthese being a bridge near Kampot that collapsed in 2006, with government funding, and the \nshort bridge in Kampong Trach, which has been proposed for funding from the Government of \nJapan. The remaining 24 bridges and culverts between Kampong Trach and Kampot are narrow \nand in poor condition. These bridges will be repaired and widened or replaced, depending on \nthe  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  consultants  providing  detailed  design  and \nimplementation services.    \n \n5.  New cross-border facilities will be constructed at Preak Chak at the Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam \nborder, and Koh Kong at the Cambodia\u2013Thailand border. At Preak Chak, the existing buildings \nwill be demolished and a 4 hectare (ha) site will be developed between the neutral zone and \n                                                 \n1  Also known as Lork\u2013Xa Xia or Preak Chak\u2013Ha Tien. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nPreak  Chak  village.  New  immigration,  customs,  CAMCONTROL, 2  and  quarantine, \nadministration  and  staff  quarters  buildings  will  be  constructed  totaling  about  5,000  square \nmeters (m2). Parking areas and access roads will be constructed on either side of NR33 to \nseparate truck activities and freight inspections from buses and cars. The new facilities for the \nCambodian  side  of  the  Koh  Kong  border  crossing  will be  located  immediately  behind  the \nexisting border post, in a site about 100 meters (m) x 60 m. The land belongs to the existing \nborder post facilities and the site lies between the border and a hotel/casino complex built in \nCambodia. Adequate lighting, power supply, water and sanitation services, and truck weighing \nfacilities will be provided at both new facilities. \n \n2.  Road Maintenance Component \n \n6.  One of the major issues in the road sector in Cambodia is poor maintenance of road \nassets.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  development  of  road  maintenance  by  providing \ntechnical support to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) as follows: \n(i)  Maintenance  planning. The identification of the most effective maintenance \nregime on a road requires an understanding of the tools available to analyze the \noptions. The objective is to determine the most economically efficient regime that \nwill keep the road in a maintainable condition throughout its economic life.  \n(ii)  Maintenance implementation. Of the maintenance undertaken to date, most \nhas  been  implemented  through  force  account  using  the  resources  of  the \nProvincial Departments of Public Works and Transport (PDPWTs). It has been \nproposed  that  this  system  needs  to  be  changed  to  implementation  through \ncompetitively bid contracts to improve efficiency and to determine market rates \nfor work, instead of negotiated rates.  \n \n7.  The condition of NR33 between Kampong Trach and Kampot varies: the first 14 km from \nKampong Trach and short sections towards Kampot have been improved under the World Bank \nFlood Rehabilitation Project. The bridges and culverts will be repaired and widened or replaced \nas part of the road improvement works described in paragraph 4 above. The remaining length \n(about 23 km) requires a program of heavy periodic maintenance to restore it to a maintainable \ncondition. The entire length of NR33 from Preak Chak to Kampot will then require a sustainable \nprogram of routine maintenance, and periodic maintenance in future.  \n \n8.  The Project will include a component for maintenance planning and implementation of \ncontracts for periodic and routine maintenance for the Kampot and Kampong Trach road. Under \nconsulting services for the Project, tasks will be included to (i) undertake a condition survey of \nNR33, (ii) identify potential maintenance regimes, (iii) determine the regime that is economically \noptimum using standard software packages such as the Highway Design and Maintenance \nModel, (iv) undertake an assessment of the capacity of existing Cambodian contractors to \nundertake contracts for routine and periodic maintenance, (v) prepare model bidding documents \nfor routine and periodic maintenance for use under competitive bidding procedures, and (vi) \nbased on the results of (iii) and (iv) identify and prepare contract documents to implement the \nfirst 3 years of the optimum maintenance regime. \n \n9.  The output of the above component will be a demonstration project on (i) maintenance \nplanning, (ii) implementation of routine and periodic maintenance through competitive bidding \ncontracts,  (iii)  exposure  of  Cambodian  contractors  to  contracts  for  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance,  (iv)  exposure  of  MPWT  and  PDPWT  staff  to  maintenance  planning  and \n                                                 \n2  The Cambodia Import Export Inspection and Fraud Repression Department (CAMCONTROL) is responsible for \ninspecting traded goods to ensure that they are legal and meet required quality standards. \n ", "  Appendix 4  35 \nimplementation of this plan through competitively bid contracts, and (v) establishment of market \nrates for maintenance work that can be used to evaluate and standardize maintenance costs. \n \nC.  Viet Nam \n1.  Road and Bridge Works  \n \n10.  The  Project  comprises  development  of  stage  1  of  the  GMS-SCC,  which  includes \nimprovement of a short section of QL80 between the border at Xa Xia and Ha Tien, and \ncompletion of the transport corridor between Minh Luong and the access road to the Khanh An \nIndustrial Zone west of Ca Mau city. \n \n11.  QL80 between the Cambodia border at Xa Xia and the start of the Ha Tien bypass will \nbe  widened  on  the  existing  alignment  by  improving  embankments,  laying  an  aggregate \nsubbase, and overlaying the old pavement with asphaltic concrete base and surface courses. \nCross-drainage structures will be widened or replaced as needed. There is a newly constructed \ncustoms and immigration building at Xa Xia spanning QL80. Parking areas for cars, buses, and \ntrucks will be constructed on either side of building to facilitate passenger and cargo inspections \nand processing.   \n \n12.  QL63 between Minh Luong and the start of the Tac Cau Bypass will be widened on the \nexisting alignment by improving embankments, laying an aggregate subbase, and overlaying \nthe old and new pavement with asphaltic concrete base and surface courses. Cross-drainage \nstructures will be widened or replaced as needed. \n \n13.  A 6.4 km bypass around the Tac Cau ferry will be constructed about 1 km south and \neast of QL63. The bypass has four bridges, including two large bridges across the Cai Be River \n(about 600 m total length) and Cai Lon River (about 680 m total length) with sufficient navigation \nclearances. The present Ministry of Transport (MOT) design calls for the main spans to be a tied \narch design. Options will be reviewed during detailed design. \n \n14.  QL63 between the end of the Tac Cau bypass and Thu Bay runs very close to the \nSong Trem\u2013Song Cai Lon Canal and has a recently constructed serviceable 7 m concrete \ncarriageway. The project works include construction of sealed shoulders, protective measures \nto prevent erosion of the canal bank and road foundation, and pedestrian safety measures such \nas barriers on sections with a high density of houses and shops. Five new bridges have recently \nbeen constructed on this section but approaches joining the bridge decks to the concrete \ncarriageway  need  to  be  reconstructed.  Kien  Giang  Provincial  Department  of  Transport  is \ncarrying out other improvement works on this section, including replacement of the remaining \nfour single-lane Bailey bridges, construction of a bypass around An Bien town, and completion \nof the northern part of the Thu Bay Bypass. \n \n15.  The south part of the Thu Bay Bypass will be completed under the Project. Works \ninclude completion of the bridge across the Thu Bay Canal connecting the north and south parts \nof the bypass and construction of about 1.3 km of new road connecting to Kien Giang provincial \nroad (TL)7 south of Thu Bay town. \n \n16.  The existing road between Thu Bay and the crossing over the Nga Bac Canal (about \n21 km) will be widened and improved. Bridge and other drainage structures will be improved or \nreplaced as necessary. A new road will be constructed between Nga Bac Canal and the access \nroad to Khanh An Industrial Zone west of Ca Mau city. This new road (about 41 km long) will \nfollow  the  alignment  of  the  existing  access  track.  Works  will  include  site  preparation  and \nconstruction of embankment, aggregate subbase and base courses, and the application of a \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \ndouble bituminous surface treatment. Bridgeworks include construction of 30 small or medium \nbridges across feeder canals and nine large bridges. The embankment for the existing access \ntrack will not be disturbed to avoid potential instability of canal banks. \n \n2.  Intermodal Transport \n \n17.  The Project will identify key locations along roads to be improved under the Project \nwhere  there  is  particular  potential  for  transfer  between  road  and  water  transport,  prepare \nrecommendations for development of intermodal facilities at them, and implement high priority \nproposals. Improvements will focus on existing public landings and will include (in descending \norder of priority) improved links between landings and the neighboring road network, storage \nfacilities, rice drying and similar facilities, and rehabilitation of landing stages. Improvements in \nphysical  infrastructure  will  be  complemented  by  enhanced  management  of  landings  and \nassociated infrastructure under the guidance of Provincial People\u2019s Committees (PPCs), with \npriority given to use of community-based organizations for management of landings to facilitate \nsustainability. This work will coordinate with the proposed Mekong Transport Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  (to  be  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank  with  cofinancing  from  the \nGovernment  of  Australia)  which  will  consider  the  development  of  intermodal  transport \ninfrastructure and services in the Mekong Delta in more detail. \n \n3.  Design Standards \n \n18.  Roads will be designed based on the following Viet Nam standards: road geometry \nTCVN 4054-2005; flexible pavement design 22TCN 211-93; soft soil treatment 22TCN 262-\n2000; and road safety and sign codes 22TCN 237-01.  \n \n19.  New roads will be designed to management class III\u2013technical class 60 km/h or 80 km/h \ngeometric standard. The cross-section elements are 2 traffic lanes (3.5 m wide), 2 sealed \nshoulders (2.0 m wide for technical class 60km/hr or 2.5 m wide for technical class 80 km/h), \nand 2 unsealed shoulders (0.5 m wide). Sight distances, horizontal and vertical alignments, and \nlateral and vertical clearances will conform to TCVN 4054-2005. Bridge cross-sections will be a \n11 m bridge deck and 2 x 0.5 m wide parapet providing a matching cross-section with technical \nclass 60 km/h roadway. \n \n20.  Existing roads will be widened to management class III\u2013technical class 60 km/h cross-\nsection on their existing alignment either by widening both sides or one side and displacing the \ncenterline. Sight distances and alignments will be changed where necessary to correct safety \nhazards but improving existing roads to the full geometric standards prescribed in TCVN 4054-\n2005 is too costly and would require relocation of a very large number of affected households, \nand is impractical.    \n \n4.  Soft Soil Treatment \n \n21.  The new road sections cross areas with soft soils requiring special ground treatment \nmethods as outlined in 22TCN 262-2000. Extensive geotechnical field surveys will be required \nprior to preparation of pavement design. Various treatment methods will be required depending \non  site  conditions,  including  dredging  and  replacement  of  soft  soils,  use  of  geotextiles, \npreloading with sand drains, and use of reinforced concrete piles in the worst cases.   \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n1.  Three full resettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared based on the preliminary design \navailable: one for national road (NR) 33 in Cambodia, and one each for Ca Mau Province and \nKien Giang Province in Viet Nam. In Viet Nam, 3,775 households will be affected by loss of \nresidential, commercial, or agricultural land within the corridors of impact of project roads and \nborder crossings. Of these, 677 houses and 513 small businesses and shops will be displaced, \nand  680  households  will  be  severely  affected  by  loss  of  productive  assets.  In  Cambodia, \n337 households will be affected by the Project. This will require relocation of 83 houses and \n58 small businesses and shops. Eight households from the expansion of border facilities will \nlose their entire total productive landholdings. \n \nB.  Legal and Policy Framework  \n2.  The policy framework and entitlements of the Project have been based upon the relevant \nlaws and regulations in Cambodia and Viet Nam, and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), Policy on Gender \nand Development (1998), Accountability Mechanism (2003), and Public Communications Policy \n(2005). In Cambodia, the Land Law, 2001, is the relevant legal basis for resettlement, and \nprocedures on ADB-financed projects are generally consistent with ADB\u2019s policies. In Viet Nam, \nwith the promulgation of Decree 197/CP (2004) and Decree 17 (2006), the Government\u2019s legal \nframework towards resettlement has moved much closer to ADB\u2019s policies. Key strategies to \nreconcile the differences are included in the RPs. Policies adopted in the project RPs will \nsupersede the provisions of laws and regulations currently in force in Cambodia and Viet Nam, \nwherever a gap exists.  \n \nC.  Project Entitlements \n3.  The overall objective of the Project with respect to land acquisition and resettlement is to \nensure that all people affected by the Project, irrespective of tenure status, are able to maintain \nand, preferably, improve their pre-project living standards and income-earning capacity through \ncompensation for the loss of physical and nonphysical assets and, as required, other assistance \nand rehabilitation measures. The absence of a formal legal title to land is not a bar to project \nentitlements. All compensation is based on the principle of replacement cost. Table A5 presents \nthe summary entitlements for both countries. Detailed project impacts and project entitlements \nare set out in the RPs in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nD.  Ethnicity, Vulnerability, and Gender Issues \n4.  There are no ethnic minorities in the project area in Cambodia. In the project areas in \nViet  Nam,  there  are  13  ethnic  Khmer  within  Ca  Mau  area  and  339  ethnic  Khmer  within \nKien Giang project area. The ethnic Khmer speak both Vietnamese and Khmer (especially the \nmen);  they  are  well  integrated  into  the  main  stream,  maintain  religious  practice  without \ninterference from the Vietnamese (Kinh), and are classified nonpoor. The Project will not affect \nthe Khmer people differently than the Vietnamese, so no ethnic minority development plan is \nrequired. However, to ensure project benefits to the Khmer people, ethnic minority specific \nactivities are included in the RPs. Special attention will be given to identifying and addressing \nany special needs of other vulnerable groups such as the landless, the poor, women-headed \nhouseholds, the disabled, and war veterans by carrying out separate consultation meetings and \nby ensuring that they benefit from the rehabilitation measures. In Viet Nam, 23% of affected \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n \nhouseholds are headed by women and 5% are below the poverty line; in Cambodia, women \nhead 25% of affected households and 11% are below the poverty line. A project gender strategy \nhas been prepared and resettlement related gender actions have been included in the RPs. The \ngender strategy is discussed separately (Appendix 12). \n \nTable A5: Summary Entitlement Matrix for Viet Nam and Cambodia \nImpact  Project Entitlements  \nViet Nam   Cambodia  \n1.

Resettlement and Income Restoration Strategies \n5.  A special feature in Cambodia is that, while all affected persons who must move out of \nthe corridor of impact of the project road will be compensated for loss of land use in the corridor \nof impact, they have the option of moving back into the remaining right-of-way (ROW) if there is \nsufficient land available, or completely out of the ROW. They will be permitted to stay within the \nremaining ROW for at least 5 years, or longer if the Government does not require the ROW for \nroadworks, but will be restricted from building permanent structures (i.e., using materials such \nas concrete). When the affected persons decide to move, whether for this Project or in the \nfuture,  they  will  be  compensated  for  loss  of  ROW  land  use  and  all  other  entitlements  in \naccordance with the RP. Forty affected persons who have no other land outside the ROW, and \nare thus landless, will be given replacement land free of charge. The main income impacts in \nCambodia will be from displaced businesses, but most impacts will be minimized by moving \nnearby within the remaining ROW. In Viet Nam, three group resettlement sites are planned for \nabout 400 of the 677 affected persons whose houses will be displaced. Individual or group \nmarket sites will also be available for affected businesses and shops. In Viet Nam, income \nlosses will be minimized by allocating alternate commercial sites with comparable commercial \nadvantage. Appropriate livelihood restoration programs will be designed during RP updating in \nconsultation with affected persons. Transitional assistance will also be provided. \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangements \n6.  In Cambodia, the Social and Environment Unit of the Ministry of Public Works and \nTransport (MPWT) with guidance from the Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) at the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF) will be responsible for updating, implementing, and \ninternal monitoring of resettlement activities. Project supervision consultants will be engaged for \nboth supervision and capacity building to ensure the effective updating and implementation of \nresettlement activities. The project supervision consultant team will include one international \nresettlement  specialist  and  one  national  resettlement/gender  specialist.  An  independent \nmonitoring organization (IMO) will be recruited and mobilized before commencement of any \nresettlement  activities,  including  the  detailed  measurement  survey.  Resettlement \nsubcommittees  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels  will  be  established  during  loan \nimplementation, and will include women members.  \n7.  In Viet Nam, the Executing Agency for the Project is Viet Nam Road Administration \n(VRA), and My Thuan Project Management Unit (PMU-MT) has been delegated responsibility \nfor planning and implementation. PMU-MT will ensure that provincial resettlement committees (if \nneeded, based on Project needs) are established for each province under the direction of the \nProvincial  People\u2019s  Committee  (PPC)\u2014as  well  as  district  compensation,  assistance,  and \nresettlement  boards;  and  commune  resettlement  task  forces.  The  provincial  resettlement \ncommittees (if needed); compensation, assistance, and resettlement boards; and commune \nresettlement task forces will be responsible to PMU-MT for updating and implementing the RPs. \nRepresentatives of the Women\u2019s Union and/or the Farmers\u2019 Association will participate actively \nin the resettlement program. PMU-MT will recruit a project supervision consultant and IMO to \nassist in and monitor the planning and implementation of the RPs.  \nG.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n8.  Affected  persons  have  been  closely  consulted  and  provided  with  opportunities  to \nparticipate  during  the  resettlement  planning  to  date,  and  this  will  continue  during  detailed \nplanning and implementation of land acquisition and resettlement. The Executing Agency and \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \n \nproject management units in each country will oversee the activities of resettlement committees \nat the provincial, district, and commune levels to carry out information dissemination and public \nconsultation programs during all stages of the land acquisition and resettlement process; the \ndetailed  design  and  implementation  services  consultants  and  IMO  will  participate  in  the \npreparation and monitoring of the implementation of these programs. Affected persons have \nparticipated  in  public  information  meetings,  and  in  inventory  of  losses  and  socioeconomic \nsurveys.  The  draft  RPs  were  disclosed  to  affected  persons  during  2\u20136  July  2007  in  both \nCambodia and Viet Nam, and final RPs will be placed in project and commune offices.  \nH.  Complaints and Grievances \n9.  The Project will ensure that affected persons have clear and accessible mechanisms \nand procedures to address complaints and grievances about any aspect of land acquisition, \ncompensation, and resettlement. In both countries, grievance redress mechanisms include: \n(i) conciliation  and  resolution  of  complaints  and  grievances  at  the  local  level,  if  possible; \n(ii) appeal to district and/or provincial authorities if the grievance is not resolved at the local level \nor if the affected person is not satisfied with a decision; and (iii) final appeal through the courts. \nAffected persons may seek assistance to lodge a complaint or grievance from third parties, and \nthere will be no charges to affected persons lodging a complaint or grievance. The IMOs will \nmonitor all aspects and activities involved in the lodging, hearing, and resolution of complaints \nand grievances.  \n \nI.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n10.  The  Project  will  ensure  internal  and  external  monitoring  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation,  and  resettlement  activities.  In  each  country,  the  Executing  Agency  and  its \ndesignated project management unit are responsible for internal monitoring. The IMOs will \nconduct external monitoring and evaluation, focusing on the social impacts of the Project and \nwhether  affected  persons  are  able  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their  pre-project  living \nstandards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity.  Sample  surveys  of  affected  persons  will  be \ncarried out biannually during implementation of the RP, as well 6\u201312 months after completion of \nall resettlement activities. \n \nJ.  Cost Estimates \n11.  The  total  cost  for  resettlement  is  estimated  at  $37.21  million.  It  covers  costs  of \ncompensation,  resettlement,  rehabilitation,  administration  costs,  internal  and  external \nmonitoring, and physical and price contingencies. Compensation rates have been determined \nthrough replacement cost studies which will be updated during RP updating. The governments \nhave  committed  to  ensuring  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for  resettlement  and  to \nmeeting  any  unforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  RP  budgets  to  satisfy  resettlement \nobjectives. \n \nK.  Implementation Schedule \n12.  The RP will be updated following detailed design and will be disclosed to APs prior to \nsubmission to ADB for review and approval. All resettlement activities will be coordinated with \nthe civil works schedules. Civil works contractors will not be issued a notice of possession for a \ngeographic area until, in accordance with the approved the RP, (i) compensation payment and \nrelocation to new sites has been satisfactorily completed for that area, (ii) agreed rehabilitation \nassistance is in place, and (iii) the area is free of all encumbrances. \n \n ", "     \n   \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimate by Expenditure Category  \n($ million) \nItem  Costs \n \nCambodia  Viet Nam  Total \nA.

Nevertheless, to obtain the benefits of the improvements it is important to \nopen the corridor to traffic. The Project has been formulated to achieve this within the limitations \nof the current availability of funds. The Project will improve the section from Kampong Trach to \nthe border crossing with Viet Nam at Preak Chak\u2013Xa Xia (15.1 kilometers [km]) and the section \nof road in Viet Nam from Minh Luong to Ca Mau (96.1 km). The road section from Ha Tien to \nMinh Luong in Viet Nam will be maintained at its existing condition. Upgrading of the Ha Tien to \nMinh Luong section will be undertaken when funds become available.     \n \n2.  The economic analysis was carried out for each country component and for the Project \nas a whole by using the Highway Design and Maintenance Model developed by the World Bank. \nThe benefits to road users were estimated by comparing the differences between the costs in \nthe with- and without-project scenarios. The improved road will reduce transport costs, which \nwill  lead  to  a  stimulus  in  economic  growth.  The  model  compared  the  annual  streams  of \neconomic capital and operating costs and benefits, and computes the net present value (NPV) \nand the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were expressed in 2006 \nconstant prices. The economic prices are expressed using the world price numeraire. The \nanalysis period is for the construction period followed by 20 years of operation.  \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n1.  Road Condition \n3.  The existing road condition has been investigated by topographic survey, pavement \ncondition  survey,  and  roughness  survey.  Following  a  review  of  the  physical  surveys, \nhomogeneous sections were defined based on traffic volumes derived from the traffic analysis, \nroughness observed during the surveys, and altitude and gradient of the road. Average surface \nroughness levels in accordance with the International Roughness Index (IRI)1 for each section \nof the existing road range from IRI 4.0 meters (m)/km to IRI 6.0 m/km. The rate of road \ndeterioration used in the economic analysis is based on the levels of surface roughness that \nexisted before the Project was implemented (without-project case) which are compared with the \nroughness values in the with-project case, and the calculation of vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nsavings caused by the road improvement are calculated.  \n \n2.  Traffic Volume \n4.  Classified  traffic  volumes  on  the  project  road  were  determined  from  traffic  surveys \nundertaken in November 2005 at 3 locations in Cambodia and 11 locations in Viet Nam. Traffic \ncounts were undertaken for a period of 2 days along with origin-destination surveys. These \nsurvey results were normalized through the application of seasonal factors to obtain annual \naverage daily traffic (AADT) for the base year. The traffic counts were split into motorized traffic \n(cars, pickup [utility], buses, trucks, and motorcycles) and nonmotorized traffic (bicycles and \nanimal-drawn vehicles). Traffic volumes on the project road sections ranged from 2,796 vehicles \nper day to 13,608 vehicles per day for motorized traffic, and from 773 vehicles per day to 2,115 \n                                                 \n1  The IRI is measured in meters per kilometer. \n \n ", "    Appendix 11      59     \nvehicles per day for nonmotorized traffic in Viet Nam. In Cambodia, traffic ranged from 813 \nvehicles per day to 2,849 vehicles per day for motorized traffic and from 1,056 vehicles per day \nto 2,677 vehicles per day for nonmotorized traffic. The average traffic composition showed that \nthere was about 81% motorized vehicles and 19% nonmotorized vehicles.  \n \n3.  Traffic Growth Rate Assumptions \n5.  Traffic growth rates were based on an analysis of various parameters. These included \nan  analysis  of  past  trends  and  forecasts  of  economic  growth  by  the  governments\u2019  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) forecasts at the national, regional, and provincial level; population \ngrowth; and growth in per capita income. The income elasticity of transport demand was used to \ndetermine the future traffic growth rate for each vehicle category. A range of elasticity values \nhave been employed in previous studies in Cambodia and Viet Nam over the last decade \nranging from 1.2 to 1.5 for estimating demand growth for passenger transport, and between \n1.0 and 1.4 for freight transport growth. Motorcycle demand has regularly been based on an \nelasticity of 2.0. The traffic growth rates adopted varied from 6% per annum to 12% per annum, \ndepending on the vehicle type and the year. An allowance has been made in the risk analysis \n(para. 11) for variations of traffic growth to take account of possible variations in the values of \nthe elasticity of demand selected. Given the above, the values adopted for elasticity of demand \nare considered appropriate. \n \nC.  Costs \n6.  The Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs and include the cost \nfor  construction,  maintenance  costs,  and  social  costs  arising  from  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement compensation. The project road cost estimates are to improve the road from its \nexisting average width of 5\u20137 m with unsealed shoulders to a carriageway width of 7 m with 2 m \nshoulders.  Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during \nconstruction. A standard conversion factor of 0.90 was applied to the financial costs of non-\ntraded inputs to calculate economic prices. The project road is expected to have an average \neconomic life of 20 years. \n \nD.  Benefits \n7.  The major economic benefits of the Project were quantified in terms of VOC savings \narising from a reduction in the operating cost of vehicles because of an improvement in the road \nsurface condition. VOC savings accrue to normal traffic (which would continue to use the road \neven if the improvement had not been made) and also to generated traffic (which did not travel \nbefore, but decides to travel as a result of the improvement of the road as it finds a benefit in \ndoing so). The benefits that will accrue to generated traffic are considered to be 50% of the \nsavings due to normal traffic. Time savings have been calculated for both normal and generated \ntraffic. Shadow wage rates were applied for both rural unskilled and skilled labor. The average \nshadow wage rate of 0.75 was applied to estimate the person-time value of $0.25 per hour for \nworking time and one third of this rate for nonworking time. \n \n8.  The benefits to road users were estimated from the differences between the costs in the \nwith- and without-project scenarios. The Highway Design and Maintenance Model was used to \nestimate the benefits over time. The model predicts pavement deterioration and estimates \nyearly VOCs over the life of the investment. In both the with- and without-project cases, the road \nroughness  level  varies  from  year  to  year  according  to  traffic  movement  and  maintenance \napplied. The roughness level, expressed in terms of the IRI, has a direct impact on the VOC and \nhence on the level of benefits. The model then compares life cycle costs for the with-project \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nsituation with the costs for the without-project situation, and computes the NPV and estimates \nthe EIRR.  \n \nE.  Results of Economic Analysis \n9.  The  EIRR  was  14.0%  for  the  Cambodia  component  and  16.8%  for  the  Viet  Nam \ncomponent. The EIRR for the Project as a whole has been calculated as 16.7%, with a NPV of \n$55.68 million, using a 12% discount rate. Table A11.1 presents the base case calculation for \nthe Project. Details on the individual economic evaluations for each country and for the project \nroad as a whole are in Supplementary Appendix B. At 16.8%, the EIRR is slightly lower than \nthat obtained for other similar projects in the same geographical area. A number of factors \ncontributed to this result but the most significant are that traffic levels for this Project are \ngenerally  low  and  construction  costs  are  high  given  (i)  soft  ground  requiring  extensive \nimprovement  works,  and  (ii)  a  dense  network  of  canals and  other waterways  that  require \nnumerous small bridges to be constructed. \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis and Risk Analysis \n10.  The sensitivity of the project road was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit \nand  cost  streams.  Several  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i)  a  20%  increase  in \nconstruction costs, (ii) a 20% decrease in benefits, (iii) a 20% decrease in the base year traffic \nestimate, (iv) a 20% decrease in traffic growth rates, (v) a 20% reduction in generated traffic, \n(vi) no time saving benefits, and (vii) a combination of a 20% increase in capital costs and a \n20%  reduction  in  benefits.  Table  A11.2  shows  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  tests,  which \ndemonstrate that the quantified economic benefits are quite robust to the various sensitivity \ntests and the Project remains economically viable. Switching values (the values that render the \nProject economically infeasible) were determined for capital costs and economic benefits. The \ncapital cost would have to increase by 56% to reduce the EIRR to 12%. The benefit level would \nhave to decrease by 36% to achieve the same effect on the EIRR. The estimate of the benefits \nfrom generated traffic would have to fall by 77% for the EIRR to fall to 12%. Eliminating \npassenger time savings does not reduce net benefits to the point of infeasibility.  \n \n11.  A risk analysis was also undertaken for the project road using the @Risk computer \nsoftware program. The risk analysis enables an analysis to be made based on the uncertainty \npresent in the estimates of the input parameters. The risk analysis was based on triangular \nprobability distributions for the main input parameters. The risk analysis runs a simulation, in \nwhich possible values of the variables were randomly sampled 5,000 times using a Monte Carlo \nnon-stratified technique. Risk analysis then uses this information to analyze every possible \noutcome, executing hundreds of what-if scenarios. In each scenario, random inputs following \nthe defined input probability distribution are generated, and the resulting frequency distributions \npresented in graphical form. The results from the analysis indicated that the probability of the \nEIRR for the Project falling below 12% is 10.6%. The probability of the EIRR falling below 12% \nis  based  on  extremely  pessimistic  probabilities,  i.e.,  no generated  traffic,  only  50%  of  the \nestimated traffic growth rate, capital costs increasing by 50%, etc. Even at these extreme \npossibilities, the probability of the EIRR falling below 12% is relatively small. The @Risk model \ncalculated the new mean EIRR for the Project as 14.2%. The minimum value of the EIRR was \ncalculated at 9.3% and the maximum value was 19.0%. A description of the methodology used \nin the risk analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n ", "    Appendix 11      61     \nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return on the Project ($ million) \n \nProject  Maintenance  VOC  Time  Net \nYear \nCostsa  Costs  Savings  Savings  Benefits \n2009  (68.62)      (68.62) \n2010  (50.42)      (50.42) \n2011  (53.75)  (0.01)             8.62   3.05  (42.09) \n2012  0.05  (0.12)           10.18   3.43  13.55 \n2013  0.03  0.00           11.12   3.87  15.02 \n2014  (0.03)  (0.10)           12.98   4.36  17.21 \n2015  (0.03)  (0.16)           16.37   5.14  21.32 \n2016  (2.42)  (0.09)           18.60   5.65  21.74 \n2017  (0.03)  (0.15)           21.24   6.23  27.29 \n2018  (3.18)  0.45           24.59   6.90  28.76 \n2019  (0.03)  (0.18)           41.09   8.03  48.92 \n2020  3.06  (0.85)           48.84   8.96  60.00 \n2021  (0.03)  (0.11)           32.51   10.31  42.68 \n2022  (2.42)  (0.17)           36.53   11.32  45.27 \n2023  (0.03)  (0.12)           41.58   12.44  53.88 \n2024  0.22  (0.25)           50.81   14.28  65.06 \n2025  (0.03)  (0.25)           47.66   15.61  62.99 \n2026  (3.34)  0.23           55.90   17.25  70.04 \n2027  0.02  (0.31)           98.65   18.84  117.20 \n2028  (1.60)  (0.22)         115.65   20.30  134.14 \n2029  0.13  (0.43)         138.12   22.34  160.16 \n2030  28.21  (1.00)         151.98   22.77  201.96 \n      EIRR   16.7 \n          NPVb 55.68 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating \ncost.       \na The positive amounts under project costs indicate savings in periodic maintenance costs in the without-\nproject scenario.  \nb  NPV discounted at 12%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.          \n \nTable A11.2: Results of Sensitivity Tests  \n \nSection  EIRR (%)  Switching Value (%) \nBase case  16.7   \nCapital costs increase by 20%  14.7   56 \nBenefits reduced by 20%  14.2  (36) \nDecrease in base year traffic by 20%  14.2   \nDecrease in traffic growth rates by 20%  13.9   \nDecrease in generated traffic by 20%  15.6  (77) \nNo time saving benefits   14.1   \nCapital costs + 20% and benefits \u2013 20%  12.4   \n               ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nG.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n12.  The economic benefits of the project road consist of road user benefits, i.e., VOC \nsavings for normal and generated traffic and time saving benefits. The distribution analysis \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \ndisaggregates  these  economic  benefits  by  passenger  and  freight  users,  vehicle \nowners/operators, labor,2 and the Government.  \n \n13.  It was necessary to estimate: (i) how much of the benefits for each vehicle category in \nthe analysis will be passed on to the user of the vehicle, and (ii) the ownership of each vehicle \ncategory. To do this, field surveys with passengers, drivers, and farmers were undertaken in the \nproject road area. From these surveys, a series of assumptions were made of what will be \npassed on to the user of the services. These assumptions are described in Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n14.  A distribution analysis was undertaken for each country component and for the project \nroad as a whole, in accordance with ADB guidelines.3 The distribution analyses were used to \nestimate a poverty impact ratio (PIR) for each country component and for the Project as a whole \nby determining how much of the benefits to each class of user in the distribution analysis are \npassed on to the poor. The assumptions made from the field surveys to undertake this are \ndetailed in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n15.  The estimated direct benefits of the Cambodia component, Viet Nam component, and \nthe Project as a whole in present value terms and the calculation of the PIR was undertaken \nusing a discount rate of 12%. The distribution of benefits and the PIR for the Project as a whole \nare in Table A11.3. The estimated direct benefits for the Project are $155.61 million in present \nvalue terms, which represents the sum of the present value of benefits to passengers, freight \nusers, vehicle owners, and the Government. The net benefit to the economy as a whole is \n$55.68 million. The PIR for the Project as a whole was 0.38. This estimate is conservative \nbecause  only  direct  benefits  have  been  considered.  Based  on  the  somewhat  uncertain \nassumptions in the calculation of the PIR, a risk analysis was undertaken on the Project\u2019s PIR. \nSeveral variables were considered to be subject to uncertainty: (i) the passenger share of VOC \nsavings, (ii) the freight user share of VOC savings, (iii) the poor\u2019s share of public transport \nusage, (iv) the poor users\u2019 share of public freight transport usage, (v) the number of poor users \nwho own their own mechanized transport, and (vi) net benefits. The results of the risk analysis \nshow that the expected PIR based on the weighted average of all simulated combinations is \n0.42. The PIRs in the risk analysis range from 0.11 to 0.75. The risk analysis undertaken is \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix B. \n   \n                                                 \n2  As some of the Project\u2019s capital expenditure and maintenance costs will be spent on local labor, unskilled laborers \nwill gain net benefits to the extent that their paid wages are higher than their opportunity cost of labor.  \n3  ADB. 1999.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam and Cambodia \nThe Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coaster Corridor (GMS-SCC) is a transport corridor running along the Gulf \nof Thailand coast from Bangkok through Thailand, Cambodia, and Viet Nam to Ca Mau City in the south. The \ncorridor\u2019s length on existing roads is about 924 kilometers (km). The Project comprises improvements to the GMS \nSCC from Kampong Trach in Cambodia to Ca Mau in Viet Nam. It is one of several strategic transport corridors being \ndeveloped to facilitate cross-border trade and support economic development in the GMS countries.  \n \nViet Nam.  Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth over the last decade had been remarkable. During 2001\u20132005, its economy \nrecorded a relatively high growth rate of about 7.5% per annum (p.a.). Rapid economic growth in economic output, \ninvestment in business, infrastructure, and the private sector\u2014combined with the Government\u2019s targeted poverty \nreduction interventions\u2014has resulted in a sharp decline in poverty. Poverty incidence fell from about 58% in 1993 to \n24.1% in 2004, with an increase in gross domestic product (GDP). To sustain economic growth, attract private \ninvestment, and take full advantage of the benefits of regional integration, infrastructure development must be \naccelerated.  \nCambodia. The country\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed during decades of civil war and conflict, and its socioeconomic \nindicators are low when compared to other countries in the region. According to census data for 2004, the population \nof Cambodia is 12.8 million and 35% of the population lived below the poverty line. The incidence of poverty has \ndeclined only modestly over the last several years. This is due to range of factors, including shortage of existing \nsources for growth, backward linkages of the domestic economy, and exclusion of the poor from the mainstream \neconomy. An improvement of basic infrastructure in Cambodia is critical for its economic development.  \n \nThe Project will assist the governments of Cambodia and Viet Nam to stimulate economic growth in the southern \ncoastal provinces in both countries by improving transport infrastructure between the countries and providing access \nto markets, employment opportunities, and better access to social services for the people. The main purpose of the \nProject is to reduce transport costs and induce more efficient movement of passengers and goods. The Project will \ncomplete the development of the GMS SCC from Bangkok through Koh Kong and Kampot provinces in Cambodia, \nand Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces in Viet Nam. In the project provinces in Viet Nam (Kien Giang and Ca Mau) \nthat are directly affected by the Project, the GDP increased at 12% p.a during 2002\u20132005. Forecasts of future \neconomic growth in the two provinces is greater than projections for the Mekong Delta as a whole (i.e., 13% p.a. for \nKien Giang and 12% p.a. for Ca Mau to 2010). As a result of this economic growth (2002\u20132005), traffic throughout the \ncorridor is expected to continue. The road improvement throughout the project area will relieve transport bottlenecks, \nwhich currently restrict movement in the area and high economic growth potential. The improved road will allow for \ndevelopment of industrial parks and factories planned in the area. \n \nThe project road user survey in Viet Nam and Cambodia identified that 27.5% of road users are poor, so project \nbenefits will accrue to about 420,000 poor beneficiaries. It is expected that the road improvement will bring a high \ndegree of economic development to the area, resulting in increased income sources and more job opportunities. \nPoverty impact analyses show that the poor will benefit from lower freight cost, lower passenger fares, and time \nsavings. The road improvement would lead to lower transport cost, increased competitiveness, expansion of economic \nopportunities and farm to market facilities, and diversification of rural employment opportunities for the poor.   \n \nThe Project would aid economic activities, nonagricultural diversification, and growth of off-farm income opportunities \nwhich are needed to address increasing landlessness among the poor in the project area. Farmers would benefit from \nlower input price because of lower freight rates. Fishing and agriculture are important growing industries in the project \narea. The improved road would allow refrigerated trucks to access fishing communities and shrimp farms, which would \nlower the cost of transport for fish and shrimp farmers.  \n \nThe Project will also improve border control facilities on both sides of the Cambodia-Viet Nam border and on the \nCambodian side of the Cambodia-Thailand border. These improvements will facilitate the cross-border transport of \ngoods and people. The GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement will apply at both border crossings. Tourism has \nstarted to develop in the project area and there is substantial potential for ecotourism. Tourism can flourish because of \nbetter road access. The improved roads and open border between Viet Nam and Cambodia will boost development in \nthe tourism sector. Overall, the Project will contribute to economic growth, which may expand economic opportunities \navailable to the poor and facilitate poverty reduction. \n ", "    Appendix 12      65     \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nFollowing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects \nclassified general intervention no longer require project level poverty assessment. Following is a discussion on social \nimpact and risks related to the Project.  \n \nThe road improvements would lead to lower transport costs and improved access of the poor to markets and social \nservices. Both poor and nonpoor will benefit from lower costs of using their owned motorized vehicles, and travel time \nwill be reduced. These benefits will not only accrue to economic activities but could also improve access to schools, \nmedical facilities, and other social services. Moreover, the ability of the public sector to provide these services in a \nmore cost-effective way would increase because of improved access to the road. Although an improved change in \ntransport facilities will bring some positive benefits, the improvement of roads and upgrading international border \ncrossings are likely to have some negative socioeconomic impacts for people living along the road. There will also be \nsome negative impact for people directly affected by land acquisition and displacement. These negative impacts \ninclude: (i) displacement of local economic activities, including local businesses, markets, shopkeepers, and vendors; \n(ii) loss of agricultural land, garden land, forestland, and residential land; (iii) displacement of local activities for \ntransport of goods from the border to markets by large commercial vehicles; (iv) escalating land prices caused by the \nroad improvements, concentration of landownership near the border, and potential displacement of local residents \nfrom the area; (v) disruption of family, community, and other social networks by the displacement of people from the \ncorridor of impact and right-of-way; (vi) increased traffic risks for people living and working along road because of \nlarge volumes of traffic and higher vehicle speeds along the improved road; (vii) increased risks of exposure to \nHIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and children during construction activities and because of large volumes of transit \ntraffic along the road and border area; and (viii) increased flow of illegal drugs and number of drug users in the project \narea because of improved access. \n \nRoad safety and road accidents, especially for children traveling to school, will be a concern for local residents \nbecause of increased traffic and vehicle speeds. The road safety awareness program and proper signage for speed \nlimits and road crossing will be included during construction and the post-construction phase.  \n \nCambodia has the highest reported adult rate of people living with HIV/AIDS among countries in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. In Viet Nam, despite the low prevalence rate, the large population translates into comparatively high numbers. \nBoth provinces of Ca Mau and Kein Giang have official estimates of 3,000 cases. There is an increased risk of \ninfection of HIV/AIDS during the construction and post-construction period. Construction road workers may affect the \nspread of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the communities around the construction sites and to \ntheir communities of origin. As traffic increases along the SCC between the two countries, truck drivers may also \ncontribute to accelerating the spread of HIV and STIs. Cambodia is source of, destination, and transit country for men, \nwomen, and children trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor. The improvements and opening up of the \nPreak Chak border will make this route more appealing to human traffickers who will shift their transport routes to this \nborder crossing and may even increase the number of victims originating in the project area. The Project will include a \nHIV/AIDS  and  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program  for  Cambodia  and  Viet  Nam  that  will  include: \n(i) advocacy  actions  on  HIV/AIDS/STIs  and  trafficking  prevention,  (ii)  information  and  education  campaigns, \n(iii) provision of HIV/AIDS and STI medical packages to clinics and medical centers along the road, and (iv) developing \na project performance and management plan for HIV/AIDS/STIs and trafficking prevention. Details of the HIV/AIDS \nand trafficking awareness and prevention programs are included in the consulting services terms of reference in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The Project will include a monitoring plan to monitor social benefits, potential negative \nimpact, and indirect benefits. The following are to be monitored: (i) employment during construction, (ii) reductions in \nfreight rates and passenger fares, (iii) reduction costs by lowering the delivered price of inputs, (iv) improved transport \nservices, (v) improved access to social services, (vi) improved road safety, (vii) improved roadside infrastructure, (viii) \nincreased number of businesses, (ix) increased employment, (x) less out-migration, (xi) increased agricultural outputs, \n(xii) increased agriculture diversity, (xiii) increased STI, (xiv) establishment of community vigilance program, (xv) \nincidents of human trafficking, and (xvi) public awareness on road safety. \n \n \n ", "66  Appendix 12 \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nDuring  the  feasibility  study  of  the  Project,  consultations  were  held  with  relevant  stakeholders  including  the \ncommunities affected by the road. The community perspective on the Project, in terms of positive and negative \nimpacts, was discussed. The community felt that roads to market and school might be more accessible because of \nthe Project. Less vehicle damage was considered an important benefit because of the improved road. Road safety \nwas noted as a serious concern of local residents. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program includes community participation during \nimplementation.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe following gender analysis related to the project area and likely impact of Project on women. The main sectors in \nwhich women are concentrated are agriculture; light industry (textile, garments); government; and social services. \nWomen have been particularly disadvantaged by the trend in certain provinces in the Mekong Delta because of the \nchange from rice farming to shrimp farming. While women undertook many tasks in rice cultivation, the construction \nof shrimp ponds is considered to be men\u2019s work. Shrimp farming requires less labor and is mostly managed by \nhousehold labor. Women laborers are not hired for shrimp farming. The wages of women in the agriculture sector are \nless than two thirds those of men. Women carry a heavy burden both at home and in work outside the home, which \nhas an impact on their lower health status and limits their education. Women from Khmer households in Mekong \nDelta are particularly disadvantaged. They lack access to health centers and services. Some women have not \nattended school and are either illiterate or have very little knowledge of the Vietnamese language. The language \nbarrier has also affects their local decision making. They have little knowledge of local organizational structures, \nwhich limits their ability to access government programs.   \n \n In Cambodia, women in the project area are key players in the domestic and economic aspects of the households, \nand are also active in community affairs. Women of all ages make up half of the population living along the road and, \non average, adult women head 25% of the households. In several communities, the proportion of female-headed \nhouseholds rises to 40%. The higher percentage of female-headed households is due to the civil war. Over 40% of \nfemale-headed household heads are engaged in some kind of business (small shop, petty trading) and this \nconstitutes their main source of income. However, women earn less than men.  \n \nCambodia is a source of, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for sexual \nexploitation and forced labor. A significant number of Cambodian women are trafficked to Thailand and Malaysia for \nlabor and commercial sexual exploitation. Cambodian men are primarily trafficked to Thailand for labor exploitation in \nthe construction and agricultural sectors. Cambodian children are trafficked to Viet Nam and Thailand to work as \nstreet beggars. In recent years, the problem of women and children being trafficked from Viet Nam to Cambodia has \nincreased. Vietnamese women are most likely trafficked through border points with Cambodia and then often \ntrafficked to a third destination. The percentage of women HIV cases in the project area is higher than the average for \nCambodia.  In  Kampot  Province,  instances  of  mother-to-child  infection  are  far  higher  than  those  experienced \nnationwide. Gender relations and values, particularly traditional tolerance of prostitution, have posed a challenge to \nthe battle against HIV/AIDS. In general, the public health system does not serve women well.  \n \nThe resettlement activities pose a potential risk for women\u2019s work in agriculture, small businesses, and other \nproductive activities. Resettlement can make women and children more vulnerable to exploitation. Women can face \nextra constraints in restoring income and livelihood activities.      \n \nThe improved road would create new opportunities for women in the area of jobs, small businesses, and better \naccess to social services. However, the extent to which women can take advantage of these opportunities depends \non economic, social, and cultural factors. The improved road and cross-border facility pose an increased risk for \nwomen and children trafficking as well as HIV transmission. The following project-specific gender strategy is targeted \nto households affected by resettlement and communities that are at risk of increased HIV/AIDS transmission and \nhuman trafficking. The gender strategy would help women from affected households to secure better access to \ncompensation resources, livelihood activities under the resettlement plan, and to minimize the potential risk of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the communities.   \n \n ", "    Appendix 12      67     \n\u2022  The district resettlement committees and commune level resettlement committees will include representatives \nfrom the District Women\u2019s Union, Commune Women\u2019s Union, and women from affected households. One man \nand one  woman representative from ethnic minority groups  will be included in each of the resettlement  \ncommittees.  \n\u2022  At the inception of the Project, a capacity building training program on resettlement activities will be designed for \nwomen and men commune officials, and women and men from affected households. Participation of poor \nwomen in the training will be ensured. The training will also include representatives from line agencies and the \ncommune Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union (Viet Nam), and District Women\u2019s officials (Cambodia) involved in \nresettlement committees.   \n\u2022  The training will include information on resettlement activities, compensation, management of compensation \nmoney, grievance procedures, and the impact of the Project on livelihood activities related to loss of agricultural \nproduce and other productive assets. The objective of the training is to provide affected communities with an \nunderstanding  of  resettlement  issues  and  better  access  to  compensation  resources  and  information  on  \ngrievance procedures.  \n\u2022  Capacity building training on resettlement issues will be conducted separately for ethnic minority groups. \nSeparate training will be organized for men and women, and women-headed households from ethnic minority \ncommunities.  \n\u2022  During preparation of loss of inventory, men and women from affected households will participate in the \ndiscussion. \n\u2022  Compensation money will be given to both men and women from affected households (including Vietnamese \nand Khmer). Livelihood activities will be planned with the active involvement of women. Consultation meetings \nwill be held separately with affected women, ethnic minority women, and elderly women to plan livelihood \nactivities.  \n\u2022  Specific attention will be provided for poor women-headed households (Vietnamese and ethnic minority women, \nelderly women) in paying compensation on time and developing relevant livelihood activities.  \n\u2022  Resettlement plans will include joint registration of land rights in the names of husband and wife (Vietnamese \nand Khmer) in instances where land is acquired.  \n\u2022  A HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program will be conducted during construction and the \npost-construction phase by the construction contractors and the Executing Agency with the active involvement of \ncommunities, relevant government agencies, and nongovernment organizations. The Women\u2019s Union, Youth \nUnion, health workers, female community leaders and members, and women from affected households will be \ninvolved in monitoring the program at the local level. The educational materials, workshop. and campaign on the \nHIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness and prevention program will be conducted separately for ethnic minority \nwomen in their respective language. \n\u2022  Gender sensitization training related to gender and resettlement, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking will be \nconducted for resettlement committees, relevant staff from the Executing Agency, and staff of the project \nimplementation unit. \n\u2022  In Viet Nam, in accordance with the Labor Code (as amended in 2002) and in Cambodia, in accordance with the \nLabor Code, 1997, all employment for the Project will respect government commitments to gender equity \nincluding staffing in the project implementation unit and resettlement committees. Construction contractors will \nensure that (i) no child will be used; (ii) no differential wages will be paid to men and women for work of equal \nvalue; (iii) basic facilities (water, sanitation) for men and women workers are provided in the construction camps; \n(iv) separate bathing and toilet facilities are provided for women workers; and (v) day care service will be \nprovided for the children of women construction workers. \n\u2022  Disaggregated monitoring indicators by gender and ethnic minority will be developed for monitoring of social \nbenefits, economic opportunities in the project area, road safety, resettlement activities, and the HIV/AIDS and \ntrafficking awareness and prevention program. \n\u2022  Two national consultants on social development and gender (one for Viet Nam and one for Cambodia) will be \nincluded in the consulting services for the implementation of the above gender strategy.  \n ", "68  Appendix 12 \nItem  Significant/     \nNot Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan Required \nNone   \n   Significant  The most serious impact will be the loss of land caused by   Full \n  road widening or realignment.
