In August 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Rural e-Development \nInitiative (the Initiative)1 focusing on information and communications technology (ICT) for rural \ndevelopment. Following approval, fact-finding mission were carried out for the pilot countries of \nCambodia and Mongolia identified under the Initiative.2 The proposed technical assistance (TA) \nwas developed, based on findings and agreements of the fact-finding mission, to finance the \nactivities outlined in the initiative paper. It is particularly focused on improving rural ICT policy, \nas  well  as  the  regulatory  and  legal  environment.3  ADB  has  also  carried  out  extensive \nconsultations with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to design the TA in line with \nthe  Asia-Pacific  Regional  Initiative  on  Rural  Communications\u2013Infrastructure  Development, \nwhich was adopted at the ITU-organized World Telecommunication Development Conference in \nDoha in 2006. Under this initiative, ITU has assisted the Asia-Pacific countries in designing, \nplanning, implementing, and monitoring their strategies and programs. Given these mutual \ninterests,  ADB  and  ITU  agreed  to  collaborate  in  implementing  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  international  development  community  has  embraced  the  universal,  ubiquitous, \nequitable and affordable access to ICT as a global mission. In 1997, the United Nations General \nAssembly declared access to communication as a basic human right. This was supported \nsubsequently by the World Summit on the Information Society in 2003. Despite this global \ncommitment, however, the so-called digital divide and universal access remain huge challenges \nfor developing countries. For example, some economies such as Japan; Republic of Korea; and \nHong Kong, China have the highest penetration of broadband and are moving toward next-\ngeneration networks while Cambodia has less than 1% internet penetration. According to ITU\u2019s \nWorld Telecommunication and ICT Indicators Report 2007, lower income and lower middle \nincome economies had average total teledensities of 11.1% and 50.3%, respectively, at the end \nof 2005. That compares to 137.4% in higher income economies. ITU statistics show that this \ndigital divide across the countries has been shrinking thanks to the rapidly growing mobile \ntelephone penetration in developing countries. Nevertheless, there is a lingering problem of \nuneven distribution of access and use of ICT across the region and within individual countries. \nThat means the benefits of ICT remain unevenly divided among people of different social and \neconomic groups.  \n \n3.  Countries that have made impressive developments in their ICT sectors show a common \ncharacteristic\u2014the  significant  improvement  in  the  ICT  policy  and  regulatory  environment \nthrough introducing competition; liberalizing foreign investment; privatizing incumbent carriers; \nseparating policymaking, regulation, and operation functions; and/or implementing universal \nservice provision. As such, the policy and regulatory environment is one of the most critical \nfactors affecting the development of ICT infrastructure and services in a country. Inasmuch as \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.  Rural  ICT  Development  Initiative.  Manila.  The  Initiative  identified  seven  major  areas  for  ADB \nassistance: (i) policy improvement, (ii) broadband connectivity, (iii) community access through community e-centers \nand mobile telephone, (iv) development of ICT local contents and e-applications and m-applications, (v) capacity \nbuilding, (vi) knowledge sharing, and (vii) partnership. The initiative paper is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n2  The mission was carried out from 24 August 2007 to 8 September 2007. These countries were selected because of \ntheir pressing challenges in rural ICT development, relatively low viability of rural ICT market development by the \nprivate sector, and the wide existence of ADB\u2019s rural development operations. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 June 2008. The funding \nrequest has been considered under the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund since September 2007 and was \napproved on 14 July 2008. \n ", "2   \nrural areas are perceived as unattractive to private carriers, more economic incentives need to \nbe built into the related policy and regulatory environment to encourage investment in rural ICT \ndevelopment and to ensure universal service provision. Traditionally, universal service has \nreferred to the practice of providing basic telecommunication services to every resident of a \ncountry. However, this definition has evolved through the years and across countries. The \nincreasing  importance  of  equal  access  to  knowledge  and  information  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and the high opportunity cost of not having this access have broadened the scope \nof universal service to include internet access in some countries. While developed countries \ntend to provide a range of sophisticated services to every household and expand the scope of \nuniversal service to broadband service, developing countries often remain focused on providing \npublic access to basic voice service. In recognition of the different country contexts, the World \nTrade Organization (WTO) reference paper on basic telecommunications provides the mandate \nfor each country to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain.4 Against \nthis  background,  the  governments  of  developed  and  developing  countries  alike  have \nexperimented  with  various  policy  and  regulatory  schemes  for  rural  ICT  development  and \nuniversal service provision. \n \n4.  Cambodia and Mongolia have set different paces for sectoral reforms, restructuring of \ninstitutions, and market liberalization. Mongolia has achieved partial privatization of the fixed-\nline  incumbent,  Mongolia  Telecom  Company;  establishment  of  an  independent  regulatory \nauthority, the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC); unbundling of the state-owned \ntelecom network by establishing a new network company, Information and Communication \nNetworking Company; and establishment of a special ICT agency, the ICT Authority (ICTA). On \nthe other hand, reforms have been implemented at a slower pace in Cambodia. The Ministry of \nPost and Telecommunications of Cambodia (MPTC) was acting as policymaker, regulator, and \nmajor telecom operator until 2006, at which time its telecom operation arm became the separate \nstate  enterprise  Telecom  Cambodia.  This  enterprise  was  then  partially  privatized.  MPTC\u2019s \nregulatory function was separated out to the Telecommunications Regulator of Cambodia (TRC). \nIn  addition,  the  National  ICT  Development  Authority  (NIDA)  was  established  as  a  special \nagency responsible for promoting ICT development.  \n \n5.  To address the rural\u2013urban digital divide issue, Mongolia\u2019s CRC has established the \nUniversal Service Obligation Fund to accumulate funds from telecom operators\u2019 contributions \nand use them for providing services to remote areas and to populations without access. The \nWorld Bank has provided $10 million in grant assistance to ICTA and the CRC since June 2006 \nfor  (i)  expanding  rural  telecommunication  through  a  least-cost  capital  subsidy  auction \nmechanism and private sector participation; and (ii) communications regulatory development in \nthe areas, among others, of licensing, spectrum management, and Universal Service Obligation \nFund  management.  Cambodia  has  also  been  implementing  rural  communication  projects \nthrough TRC and NIDA with support from the World Bank to expand voice service to rural areas. \nAlthough these efforts show how improvements in policy and regulatory environments could \ndrive rural ICT development, such efforts are currently limited to voice service. Internet service \nis significantly lacking in rural areas, and particularly in terms of broadband service.  \n \n6.  To fully utilize the potential of new technologies for socioeconomic development, it is \nimportant to keep up with the fast-paced technology development. ICT policymakers, regulators, \n                                                 \n4  Source: http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/serv_e/telecom_e/tel23_e.htm. Within this framework, regulators have \nplayed the role of (i) defining universal access, (ii) determining affordability, (iii) implementing and financing \nuniversal service and access goals, (iv) verifying universal service obligation costs, (v) reviewing progress, and (vi) \nensuring community participation in determining targets. \n ", "  3\nand operators need to develop innovative policy and regulatory schemes as well as business \nmodels compatible with technological advancement. Technological progress in ICT has enabled \nunprecedented  convergence  of  different  types  of  ICT  networks,  services,  contents,  and \ninterfaces. Traditional single-purpose networks established separately for voice, data, and video \nhave been overtaken by a single internet protocol-based network. This makes the introduction \nof affordable and reliable broadband a critical agenda item, as it will help developing countries \nto leapfrog from older technologies. Wireless internet technologies are proving to be particularly \nattractive, as they are much more cost-effective, easier to deploy and maintain, and more \nadaptable to local environments compared to old, fixed-line technologies. A wireless broadband \nnetwork increases the availability and affordability of bandwidth for such e-applications as voice \nover internet protocol (VoIP) service,5 e-commerce, e-education, e-government, telemedicine, \nand video conferencing. The implication of broadband is particularly significant in rural areas, \nbecause of their many fewer alternatives for such ICT-enabled services.  \n \n7.  Utilizing such new technological opportunities to provide equal benefits for all requires \nappropriate policy and regulatory frameworks, such as those that provide economic incentives \nfor broadband investment in rural areas using public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and output-\nbased aid (OBA) or performance-based subsidies, allow interconnection of VoIP service in the \nfixed-line or mobile telecommunication market at least in rural areas,6 and introduce more \nflexible  licensing  policy  and  spectrum  management  schemes.  Innovative  business  models \noffering a wide range of affordable pricing options (e.g., prepaid cards) can also contribute to \nexpanding market coverage to the rural poor. Policy and regulatory reforms and business model \ndevelopment  are  therefore  essential,  and  associated  improvement  in  the  knowledge  and \ncapacity of ICT policymakers, regulators, operators, and other key stakeholders is required. \nRecognizing this, ITU and the World Bank have developed ICT regulation toolkit modules and \nITU has published Global Symposium for Regulators\u2019 best practice guidelines and discussion \npapers. Given ICT\u2019s rapid technological development, however, the existing toolkits need to be \nupdated and expanded to cover such new areas as rural broadband service provision (which is \nnot now covered). \n  \n8.  The Asia and Pacific region is becoming a rich source of rural ICT policies, regulations, \nand practices. Countries like People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), India, Indonesia, Republic of \nKorea,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines,  in  particular,  have  devised  a  wide  range  of  policy  and \nregulatory schemes and practices. Each has performed impressively in rural ICT development \nand  universal  service  provision.  Although  the  schemes  have  their  own  strengths  and \nweaknesses, as they address the unique circumstances of particular countries, experiences \nfrom these countries can be a good source of learning for other developing countries. However, \nthe latest practical examples from the best-performing countries are not easily available and \naccessible to the rest of the countries that aspire to learn. Acquiring up-to-date knowledge is a \ncrucial step for ICT policymakers, regulators, and operators in order to build their capacity to \ndevelop their own policies and business models for rural ICT development and universal service \nprovision. In view of this, there is an urgent need to initiate capturing ICT policy lessons and \npractices to be used for policy improvement, knowledge sharing, and capacity building for rural \nICT development and universal service provision in the Asia and Pacific region.  \n                                                 \n5  VoIP service enables voice communication through the internet with no charge (for computer-to-computer calls) or \nat lower cost than the traditional public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls (for computer-to-phone calls). \n6  Some countries, including Cambodia, do not allow VoIP service as one of their telecommunication services. They \nregard it as an internet-based application and thus have no legal and regulatory framework to allow interconnection \nbetween the networks of VoIP service providers and telecom operators within a country or with foreign telecom \noperators. This is mainly to prevent deterioration in revenues to incumbent telecom operators, and particularly \nthose owned by the state.  \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA aims to contribute to improving policy, legal, and regulatory environments to \nmake them more conducive to the rapid deployment of ICT infrastructure and services for rural \ndevelopment. At the completion of the proposed TA, it is envisaged that the TA will enhance the \nparticipating countries\u2019 capacity in planning, implementing, and monitoring their policies and \ntheir legal and regulatory frameworks for rural ICT development with better implementation \nmechanisms and tools and through knowledge-sharing activities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The proposed TA has three major components: (i) case studies and toolkit development, \n(ii) policy analysis and improvement, and (iii) knowledge sharing and capacity building.  \n \n11.  Component A: Case Studies and Toolkit Development. Building upon the relevant \npublications and studies undertaken by the World Bank, ITU, WTO, and other development \npartners,  as  well  as  on  academic  research,  this  component  will  first  review  the  theoretic \nliterature,  internationally  governing  or  recommended  frameworks  (including  WTO),  and \nempirical  research  on  the  different  policy  and  regulation  schemes  and  practices  (both \ngovernment-driven and market-based approaches) used to encourage rural ICT development \nand  implement  universal  service  provision.  Based  on  such  review,  it  will  then  develop \nframeworks of the case studies and outlines of policy toolkits.  \n \n12.  Second, following the developed frameworks and outlines, the component will conduct \ncase studies on the six countries identified in para. 8, with particular focus on their impact \nperformance in rural ICT development and universal service provision and related success and \nfailure factors. The methodologies to be used include interviews, focus group discussions, \nsurveys,  and/or  workshops  with  local  stakeholders  (including  telecommunication  and  ICT \nnetwork and service providers, and internet-based companies, nongovernment organizations, \nresearch institutes, local governments and authorities, municipalities, and others).  \n \n13.  Third, based on the literature review and the findings from case studies, policy toolkits \nwill be developed for ICT policymakers and regulators to support their rural ICT development \nand universe service provision. These will consist of (i) policy design principles and general \nguidelines, and (ii) a toolkit for ICT policymakers and regulators to develop necessary and \nappropriate policies and regulations for rural ICT development and universal service provision. \nParticular attention will be given to rural broadband expansion.  \n \n14.  Component B: Policy Analysis and Recommendations in Cambodia and Mongolia. \nThis component will analyze relevant policies, strategies, and legal and regulatory frameworks \nrelated to rural ICT development and universal service provision in Cambodia and Mongolia. \nBased on this analysis and using the benchmark cases and toolkits to be developed under the \ncomponent  above,  this  component  will  develop  recommendations  for  necessary  reform \nstrategies and schemes to reinforce the key success elements and lessen (if not eliminate) \nfactors that lead to failure, as well as to encourage the provision of appropriate rural ICT \ninfrastructure and universal services. Based on the assumption that an enabling policy and \nregulatory environment for universal access and fair competition can promote and accelerate \nrural ICT development, it is important to involve all relevant stakeholders, including the telecom \nindustry  and  public  sector,  in  order  to  determine  and  take  into  consideration  their  needs, \n ", "  5\nopinions,  and  requirements  when  recommending  appropriate  policies,  legislation,  and \nregulations aimed at rural ICT development. As a part of its scope, therefore, this component \nwill  conduct  public  hearings  and  various  activities  (e.g.,  interviews,  surveys,  focus  group \ndiscussions, and workshops) to gather inputs from concerned stakeholders. \n \n15.  Component  C:  Knowledge  Sharing  and  Capacity  Building.  This  component  will \nprovide various platforms for knowledge sharing on the findings, practices, case studies, and \nother  knowledge  products  among  the  ICT  policymakers,  regulators,  operators  and  policy \nresearchers  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  It  will  use  the  latest  knowledge  management \ntechniques and networking technologies, including online communities of practice and websites. \nIn collaboration with national research institutes or universities specialized in ICT policy and \nregulation research, the developed toolkits and case studies will be transformed into training-\nthe-trainer programs.  The  training  program  will  be  offered  to  the  selected  policymakers  in \nCambodia and Mongolia.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $680,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nand administered by ADB and $180,000 will be financed by ITU through its in-kind and cash \ncontribution. The estimate covers the costs of (i) consultant services for (a) the development of \nknowledge  product  and  toolkit,  and  (b)  policy  analysis  and  recommendations;  (ii)  costs  of \nimplementing  the  TA,  including  international  and  local  travel,  monitoring  and  evaluation, \nreporting, etc.; and (iii) workshops, seminars, and training sessions for policymakers in the Asia \nand Pacific region. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. NIDA and TRC of Cambodia and ICTA and CRC of \nMongolia will be the implementing agencies in their respective countries for component B. ICT \noperators and ICT policy research institutes from the selected countries will be engaged as \nstakeholders in project activities. ADB will closely collaborate with ITU in implementing the TA \nand, before implementation, will sign a cooperation agreement or similar document with ITU to \ndefine the roles and responsibilities of ADB and ITU. The TA will require a total 36 person-\nmonths of consultants with expertise in ICT policy and regulation and in universal service \nprovision. International consulting services of 6 person-months and national consulting services \nof  30  person-months  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants is in Appendix 3, and those for ITU are in Appendix 4. The proposed \nTA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing from February 2009. \n \nIV.
