THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed Southeast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility Phase 2, a regional \ntransaction technical assistance facility (TA Facility), will provide project preparation support and \ncapacity building for a series of ensuing investment projects in the transport sector in Southeast \nAsian developing member countries (DMCs), initially comprising the following nine projects: \n(i) Railway  Development  Project  (Indonesia);  (ii)  Railway  Modernization  Project  (Myanmar); \n(iii)  Additional Financing to Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Highway Modernization Project \n(Myanmar);  (iv)  Davao  Public  Transport  Modernization  Project  (Philippines);  (v)  Additional \nFinancing  to  GMS  Highway  Expansion  Phase  2  Project  (Thailand);  (vi)  Road  Network \nSustainability Project (Timor-Leste); (vii) Dili Airport Upgrading Project (Timor-Leste); (viii) Public \nTransport Project (Timor-Leste); and (ix) Ho Chi Minh City Urban Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 \nProject (Viet Nam). The TA Facility is listed in the respective Country Operations Business Plans \n(COBPs) 2020-2022 for Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet \nNam.1   \n \n2.  Ongoing support. Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved and made effective the first \nSoutheast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility (Phase 1) in November 2018, with a closing \ndate of 31 December 2021.2 The total cost of Phase 1 is $5,000,000, which is financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,500,000 from TASF 6 and $3,500,000 \nfrom TASF-other sources). Phase 1 is assisting Southeast Asian DMCs to prepare projects and \nbuild their capacity for 27 ensuing transport sector projects included in the COBPs for 2019\u20132021, \nwith an estimated total loan amount of $7.2 billion.3 Phase 1 has provided support with individual \nconsultants, and will engage additional consultant support to respond to the needs for project \npreparation and capacity building in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nThailand, and the Philippines.4 In addition to Phase 1, there are an ongoing TA loan and stand-\nalone transaction TAs to support a series of other ensuing projects in the transport sector.5  \n \n3.  Growing demand for transport infrastructure. The need for infrastructure development \nin Southeast Asia is steadily growing. The transport sector pipeline for 2020\u20132022 includes 30 \n \n1 The TA Facility\u2019s support shall also be extended to Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nwhose respective COBPs 2020-2022 include the proposed TA Facility. All of the initial nine ensuing projects are also \nlisted in the respective COBPs 2020-2022 for Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet \nNam. \n2 ADB. REG: Southeast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility (TA 9631). As of 30 November 2019, the cumulative \ncontract award and disbursement are $1,793,530 (36%) and $426,948 (9%), respectively. \n3 The ensuing projects supported by Phase 1 include (i) Integrated Road Network Improvement Project (Cambodia); \n(ii) Additional Financing to Second Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement Project (Lao \nPDR); (iii) Bataan\u2013Cavite Bridge Project (Philippines); (iv) Laguna Lakeside Road Project (Philippines); (v) Manila \nMass Rapid Transit Line 4 (Philippines); (vi) Bangkok Urban Transport Development - West Orange Line (Thailand); \n(vii) Regional Airports Improvement Project (Thailand); and (viii) Tak\u2013Mae Sot Road Tunnel Project (Thailand). The \nfinancing modality of some of these ensuing projects is multitranche financing facility, and the total loan amount would \nbe over $12 billion if the financing amount for the entire multitranche financing facilities are considered. \n4 Upon request from Cambodia, the Philippines, Lao PDR, and Thailand, Phase 1 has expanded its scope while \nretaining the total TA amount. See Indicative Technical Assistance Budget Allocation (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 3).    \n5 ADB. PHI: Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility (Loan 3589); ADB. INO: Sustainable Infrastructure \nAssistance Program for Indonesia (TA 0013); ADB. INO: Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program Phase II (TA \n0040); ADB. MYA: Transport Sector Reform and Modernization (TA 8788). A list of all ensuing projects supported by \nPhase 1 is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "2   \nnew loans, with an estimated total loan amount of $10.3 billion.6 A comparison with the existing \nportfolio of 55 ongoing loans and grants with a cumulative amount of only $5.1 billion shows that \nboth the scale of the portfolio and the size of the projects are increasing, while the nature of the \nprojects is remaining complex. Further, the expansion of transport sector operation to railways \nand public transport can be seen in Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, and Viet \nNam, in an effort to promote a modal shift to energy efficient public transportation and contribute \nto climate change mitigation. In addition, Timor-Leste intends to expand its investment in an \nairport to strengthen regional and international connectivity. Traditional road projects will also \ncontinue to strengthen inter-city and regional connectivity. \n \n4.  In addition to providing support for the ensuing projects included in the relevant COBPs \nfor the period 2020-2022 (para. 1), the proposed TA Facility will also provide due diligence and \ncapacity building support, as needed, to those ensuing projects included in the COBPs for the \nperiod 2019-2021 (para. 2) and other ongoing projects. ADB\u2019s prompt and seamless support from \nproject processing to implementation will allow the executing and implementing agencies to \nensure high project readiness, help to attract private sectors\u2019 participation in the ensuing projects, \nand develop quality and efficient transport systems and sustainable system operation.    \n \n5.  Need for expertise and capacity development. In subsectors such as railways, public \ntransport,  and  aviation,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  usually  do  not  have \ncomprehensive knowledge and experience in the development and implementation of efficient \noperating, climate-friendly, and disaster-resilient systems. These systems are built on non-\nmotorized transport, an integrated fare system, transit-oriented development, efficient operation \nand maintenance, and the management of complex interfaces with numerous packages/elements \nand other transport systems. The lack of knowledge and experience of the executing and \nimplementing agencies may lead to inefficient system designs and implementation delays, and \nresult in unsustainable transport system operation.    \n \n6.  To effectively process ensuing projects and prevent implementation delays and poor \nproject performance, it is necessary to improve project readiness by promptly meeting ADB \nrequirements on: (i) recruitment of consultants; (ii) procurement of goods and works contracts; \n(iii) safeguards implementation, monitoring, and reporting; (iv) other thematic areas, such as \nclimate  change,  governance,  and  gender;  and  (v)  contract  management  and  construction \nsupervision.  \n \n7.  Lessons learned. The proposed TA Facility will continue to apply the faster delivery \nmechanisms and the use of regional approaches adopted under Phase 1, while incorporating \nlessons from Phase 1, such as building a comprehensive TA support roadmap at an early stage, \nefficiently identifying available resources, promptly making decisions to mobilize resources within \na  division,  applying  common  and/or  specialized  resources,  and  effectively  managing  the \nresources by a TA coordinator. As a result, the TA Facility will: (i) enhance project preparation \nefficiency and improve project readiness; (ii) improve synergies within a pool of consultants \nworking in different countries but facing similar implementation challenges and policy issues; \n(iii) reduce  lengthy  consultant  recruitment  processes  and  transaction  costs;  (iv)  improve \nknowledge  transfer  from  one  country  to  other  countries  through  the  consultants;  and \n(v) strengthen coordination of resource use and TA outputs among the DMCs.  \n \n \n6 These 30 loans, including tranche loans under the multitranche financing facilities, comprise all loans anticipated \nunder multitranche financing facilities. A loan under each tranche will be processed upon receipt of the relevant \nperiodic financing request.  \n ", "3 \n8.  Strategic alignment. The proposed TA Facility is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. As \nthe ensuing projects to be supported by the TA Facility aim to address transport system\u2019s \nstructural deficiency with applicable climate change adaptation measures, promote a modal shift \nto public transport as a climate change mitigation measure, and develop the executing and \nimplementing agencies\u2019 governance and institutional capacity for effective project preparation, the \nTA Facility will support Strategy 2030 operational priorities (OPs), including OP 3 (tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability), \nOP4 (making cities more livable), OP6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity), and \nOP7 (fostering regional cooperation and integration).  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Feasibility study for ensuing projects prepared. The proposed TA Facility \nwill provide consultants\u2019 support to prepare investment projects for potential ADB financing, \nincluding due diligence, assessment of technical viability and suitability of the proposed solutions, \neconomic  and  financial  viability  and  sustainability,  governance  associated  with  institutional \ncapacity (e.g., financial management, procurement, and policy), and environmental and social \nsafeguards. The TA Facility will also identify risks and measures to mitigate the risks and \nstrengthen project implementation capacity of the executing and implementing agencies for the \nensuing investment projects. Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) feasibility studies \nrequired for processing the ensuing investment projects; (ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial \nmanagement assessment, financial evaluation and financial analyses; (iv) procurement capacity \nassessment, contract packaging and preparation of procurement plans,  and preparation of \nbidding documents; (v) risk assessment and management plans; (vi) safeguards documents on \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; (vii) climate adaptation measures \nand climate risk and vulnerability assessment; (viii) gender analysis, collection of baseline data, \nand preparation of gender action plans; and (ix) transport sector assessment. Deliverables, such \nas feasibility studies and linked documents, will be disseminated through publication on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. Support under the proposed TA Facility will be coordinated with the ongoing TA loan and \ntransaction TAs (footnote 5) to avoid overlaps.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Project implementation activities supported. The proposed TA Facility will \nprovide consultants\u2019 technical support to the executing and implementing agencies to avoid \ndelays in project implementation, such as procurement and safeguards implementation. Upon \nreceipt of request from DMCs, support will be provided to assist preparation and execution of a \nbidding process, including responding to queries from potential bidders during the bidding period, \nissuing addendum/corrigendum to bidding documents, bid opening and bid evaluation, and/or \nawarding the contract. Similarly, support will be available for consultant recruitment process, \ndesign refining process, and studies to address specialized technical, institutional, and policy \nissues. For land acquisition and resettlement, support may include a detailed measurement \nsurvey to update a resettlement plan, if necessary, and monitoring activities.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Technical  and  project  management  capacity  of  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies improved. The proposed TA Facility will provide the executing and \nimplementing agencies with the support of the consultants engaged under outputs 1 and 2 to \nimprove their technical and project management capacity. The consultants financed by the TA \nFacility will provide (i) on-the-job training through their daily work with the DMC counterparts, and \n(ii) training, workshops, and conferences for counterparts from the DMCs. Topics may include \nADB policies and procedures, modalities, and project design and implementation, in addition to \nany specialized common technical, institutional, and policy issues in certain areas of interventions, \nsuch as with urban railways, non-motorized transport, transit-oriented development, intelligent \n ", "4   \ntransport system, and sustainable operation and maintenance. The support of consultants for \nsuch  an  upstream  project  development  activity  where  ADB  is  likely  to  have  downstream \nengagement in the future will be provided to not only the executing and implementing agencies \nfor the ensuing projects, but to officials in Cambodia and Lao PDR, who have common issues, \nthrough coordination  with  the  resident missions  and  other  divisions  of  the  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment  to  create  synergy  while  avoiding  overlaps.  Educational  materials,  such  as  a \nknowledge brief, will be developed through dialogue, sector diagnostics, and assessments of \ninternational practices, and be shared with the counterparts to promote their understanding and \nsharing of ideas and solutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The proposed TA Facility is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($3,000,000  from  TASF  6  and \n$2,000,000 from TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access \nto existing reports and data, and other in-kind contributions. The TA Facility may be replenished \nfrom time to time as funds are required and identified, or co-financing from trust-funds becomes \navailable. The governments were informed that approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The activities under the TA Facility will start only after ADB approves the project concept \npaper on the ensuing project and/or ADB reaches an agreement with the concerned DMC to \ncommence the activities. The scope of the TA Facility is expected to be expanded to support \nadditional projects in future COBPs, as identified during country programming missions.  \n \n15.  ADB will be acting as an executing agency to administer the TA Facility. The Transport \nand Communications Division (SETC) of the Southeast Asia Department will select, administer, \nand evaluate consultants. SETC will supervise the consultants\u2019 outputs for the respective ensuing \nprojects. Consultants\u2019 services for each ensuing project, especially consulting works in the \nindividual country, will start only after an agreement with the governments on the scope of works, \nterms of reference for the consultants, implementation arrangements, and schedule, among \nothers, has been confirmed.  \n \n16.  The TA Facility will be implemented over 36 months, commencing in December 2019. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nTable: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2019\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Railway project  $855,000 \npreparation (INO) \n  Individual: individual  Railway project  $177,000 \nselection  preparation (MYA) \n ", "5 \n  Individual: individual  Road project  $514,000 \nselection  preparation (MYA) \n  Individual: individual  Public transport project  $263,000 \nselection  preparation (PHI)  \n  Individual: individual  Road project  $161,000 \nselection  preparation (THA) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Road project  $308,000 \npreparation (TIM) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Airport project  $1,118,000 \npreparation (TIM) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Public transport project  $308,000 \npreparation (TIM) \n  Individual: individual  MRT project  $264,000 \nselection  preparation (VIE) \n  Individual: framework  International expertise  $871,000 \nagreement  (28.5 person-months) \n  Individual: individual  National expertise (52  $161,000 \nselection  person-months) \nProcurement  Equipment to be procured by consultants following ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated project administration instructions and TA staff \ninstructions.  \nAdvance contracting  To expedite consultant mobilization, advance contracting is \nproposed for a country with a track record of prompt signing of the \nTA letter or agreement.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Upon TA completion, all goods purchased will be turned over to the \narrangement upon TA completion  executing and implementing agencies.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; INO = Indonesia; MRT = mass rapid transit; MYA = Myanmar; PHI = Philippines; \nQCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; TA = technical assistance; THA = Thailand; TIM = Timor-Leste; VIE = Viet \nNam.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank\u2019s estimates. \n \n17.  Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.7 The composition of the consultants for each ensuing project is identified based \non the project\u2019s complexity, necessary areas for due diligence, and support to the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  for  technical  and  project  management  capacity  strengthening.  The \nconsultants will have experience in their respective fields and demonstrate sound technical \nknowledge of road, rail, bus, and aviation sub-sectors.8 \n \n18.  Consulting firms will be engaged following the quality- and cost-based selection method, \nwith  a  quality-cost  ratio  of  90:10,  due  to  the  complexity  of  the  ensuing  projects  and  the \nrequirements for specialized consulting firms. Individual international and national consultants will \nbe mobilized to undertake the remaining tasks for certain ensuing projects that have received due \ndiligence  support  from  the  ongoing  TA  loan  and  transaction  TAs  (footnote  5),  and  the \ngovernments\u2019 activities. \n \n \n7  See Indicative Consultants\u2019 Input Allocation and Indicative Technical Assistance Budget Allocation in Appendix 2. \n8  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6   \n19.  Under a framework agreement for a pool of consultants, ADB will engage individual \ninternational consultants, including a transport economist, a procurement specialist, a financial \nmanagement specialist, an environment specialist, and a climate change specialist. The individual \ninternational consultants engaged will efficiently support the preparation of more than one project \nand capacity building under the TA Facility. To minimize the contract administrative burden, a TA \ncoordinator will be mobilized in SETC. The coordinator will liaise with the governments and \nconsultants for the activities, and closely work with ADB to achieve effective TA implementation.  \n \n20.   The consultant contracts for any package may be expanded to cover other activities \nand/or  projects  through  contract  variations,  based  on  the  assessment  of  the  consultant\u2019s \nperformance, determined by the executing agency of the ensuing project and ADB.   \n \nE.  Governance \n \n21.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. Thorough risk assessments for financial \nmanagement, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented in any of \nthe DMCs will be conducted under the TA.   \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Southeast Asia Transport Project Preparatory Facility, Phase 2, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.  \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \nDecember 2019 \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
