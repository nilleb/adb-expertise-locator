INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the Philippines, a fact-finding mission was fielded in \nFebruary 2005 to formulate a project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 for finalizing the \npreparation of a comprehensive slum upgrading and urban renewal program for Metro Manila. \nThe mission held discussions with officials of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating \nCouncil (HUDCC), the Department of Finance, National Economic and Development Authority \n(NEDA),  other  government  agencies,  local  government  units  (LGUs),2  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). Understanding was reached on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nand implementation arrangements for the TA. The Project Design and Monitoring Framework is \nset out in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The TA builds on extensive work to prepare a comprehensive slum upgrading project for \nMetro Manila undertaken during 2003.3 The current TA responds to changes to the leadership in \nthe cities and administration of Metro Manila and a renewed commitment to urban asset reform \nthat  have  resulted  in  a  more  stable  environment  for  project  implementation  and  for \nimplementation of the 15-year slum eradication policy that had been developed with HUDCC \nand the LGUs. This policy is designed to address the results of rapid urbanization in the \nPhilippines and in the megacity of Metro Manila in particular.  Metro Manila is a metropolitan \narea comprising 17 cities and municipalities, with a population that increased from under 2.5 \nmillion in 1964 to over 12 million in 2000 and is projected to reach 14.8 million in 2015.4 It grows \nat 3.3% annually and contributes approximately 30% of the Philippines\u2019 gross national product. \nOver 20% of the population lives either below or near the poverty line and 35% resides in \ninformal slum settlements,5 many of which are gateways for a continuous influx of poor rural \nmigrants. The settlements\u2019 growth and demand for services have overwhelmed the capacity of \nthe government and NGOs to respond effectively. Resettlement programs that have attempted \nto relocate the urban poor to remote sites away from established sources of livelihood have \ngenerally failed.  \n \n3.  On-site urban upgrading and integrated urban development approaches can address \nurban  poverty  and  improve  access  to  basic  services,  while  avoiding  complicated  off-site \nresettlement schemes that are prone to failure. While the available land under the control of the \nLGUs in Metro Manila is in short supply, national government land parcels have been identified \nfor privatization. Previous efforts to sell these parcels through public bidding have failed, largely \nbecause of squatters occupying the land. The Local Government Code (LGC) entitles the LGU \nconcerned to 40% of the proceeds of the sale of such land as its share in the \u201cproceeds from \ndevelopment and utilization of the national wealth\u201d.6 LGUs have expressed interest in on-site \nupgrading of these land parcels or in using them as in-city relocation sites for their squatter \npopulations. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 February 2005. \n2  Cities of Mandaluyong, Manila, Marikina, Muntinlupa, Pasay, Quezon, and Taguig. \n3  ADB. 2001.

The TA supports the thrusts outlined in the Government\u2019s medium-term development \nplan (2004\u20132009), the national housing and urban development framework, and the national \nurban policy agenda, 2004-2009. The Government has also announced adoption of the \u201cDe \nSoto\u201d principle;7 to seek equity, social justice, and broad gains in economic development by \nunblocking urban land markets, disposing of idle government land, and granting land titles to the \nurban poor. \n \n5.  The TA and the ensuing program of investment projects will support the policy reform \nagenda, and initiate a phased, multiyear slum eradication and upgrading program in support of \ndecentralization and devolution. Local governments, in partnership with communities and the \nprivate sector, will assume responsibility for urban upgrading, renewal, and regeneration. These \nrecommendations are supported by experience gained in similar land sharing, urban renewal \nprojects  (see  Appendix  2)  under  earlier  urban  TA  projects,8  and  under  the  three  urban \nupgrading  and  relocation  pilot  projects  funded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction \n(JFPR)\u2014in Muntinlupa and Payatas, and the public\u2013private \u201cSTEP UP\u201d9 project. These projects \nhave provided important lessons for land tenure security, the use of individual lending through \nfinancial institutions that are accessible to the poor, and the need to engage with NGOs. \n \n6.  National government land slated for privatization includes the 76-hectare Welfareville \nproperty in Mandaluyong, the 450-hectare New Bilibid Prison property in Muntinlupa, and the \nNational Government Center in Quezon City, among others. Building on the Government\u2019s \npolicy of providing \u201cproclamations\u201d to provide initial security of tenure for the urban poor, there is \na need to formalize occupants\u2019 tenure and to improve housing and infrastructure in these areas. \nUsing these remaining tracts of government land for in-city urban poor housing, integrated into a \nbalanced urban development scheme, is perhaps the last chance for Metro Manila to resolve \nthe long-standing problem of slum and squatter settlements through a peaceful large-scale \nprogram of upgrading and relocation. The unrealized asset potential of this urban land, or \u201cdead \ncapital\u201d (see footnote 7) as it has been characterized, is estimated at $66.4 billion for Metro \nManila and adjacent urban areas. \n \n7.  A concerted multistakeholder effort is required to formulate and execute a policy reform \nagenda and action plan to reclaim and convert government land into value-added housing \nschemes that involve the private sector and civil society. Appropriate community mobilization, \nplanning, and financing arrangements need to be put in place. The capacity of LGUs to design \nand implement urban development projects must be strengthened. The TA will address these \nrequirements, and will package a subsequent loan project suitable for financing by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project,  being  a  multisectoral  approach  to  urban  poverty \nreduction,  substantially  contributes  to  a  realization  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs).  In  particular,  it  will  contribute  directly  to  the  achievement  of  Goal  7  (Ensure \nenvironmental sustainability), specifically targets 10 (Halve, by 2015, the proportion of people \nwithout sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation) and 11 (Have achieved, by \n2020, significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers). It will make an \nindirect contribution to the achievement of Goal 3 (Promote gender equality and empower \nwomen) and Goal 4 (Reduce child mortality).    \n                                                 \n7  De Soto, Hernando. 2000.

This project preparatory TA aims to assist the Government in its asset reform agenda, \nand in the implementation of a phased, metropolitan-wide 15-year strategy for slum eradication \nand urban upgrading in Metro Manila. It will initiate a process for formulating integrated urban \ndevelopment interventions by LGUs in support of the strategy, including support for the transfer \nof national government land to local governments, and in preparing an investment project for \nhigh-priority sites within Metro Manila.  \n \n9.  The TA will design a project which will: (i) strengthen planning and management for \ninclusive urban renewal, ensuring that access of the poor to livelihood and services is improved; \n(ii) establish mechanisms to promote and finance new investment, using incentives and other \ninnovative tools to direct and manage growth and unlock the urban land market, in particular the \nredevelopment  of  depressed  urban  poor  communities;  (iii)  promote  sound  environmental \nmanagement; (iv) assist communities to create viable management mechanisms to support \ncomprehensive urban revitalization programs; and (v) strengthen sector organizations to ensure \nthat these activities are sustainable. The Project will focus on several high-priority sites which \nwill form the basis of the investment project. However, it may also include a more structural \napproach to promoting and financing pro-poor urban renewal.  \n \n10.  Planning of the subprojects will take into account the needs of stakeholders, including \ngovernment departments and corporations, LGUs, NGOs, community organizations, and the \nprivate sector. An integrated package of high-priority components in selected LGUs will be \nprepared for consideration for funding by ADB, other aid agencies, and the private sector. The \nProject will aim to demonstrate what is possible by piloting a well-defined, limited, and therefore \nmanageable, scope of activities. The initial poverty and social analysis is shown in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The Project aims to support the initiatives already commenced by the Government, in \nparticular the issuance of entitlements to plots on the Project sites. Project components to be \nundertaken  in  each  LGU  will  include  pro-poor  shelter  strategies,  land  consolidation,  site \ndevelopment,  and  infrastructure.  The  pro-poor  shelter  strategies  component  will  cover  (i) \npoverty mapping using geographic information systems (GIS), development of a formal cities-\nwithout-slums strategy including identification of priority sites for Metro Manila urban services for \nthe  poor  (MMUSP);  and  (ii)  documentation  of  a  development  framework  for  each  priority \nMMUSP community. The land consolidation component will (i) document the administrative and \ncapacity requirements of the HUDCC, LGUs, and other agencies for urban renewal and secure \ntenure  and  associated  actions;  (ii) identify  and  draft  required  executive  orders  (EOs), \nregulations, and other administrative documents, and any amendments to these; and (iii) for \npilot  communities  under  MMUSP,  prepare  required  documentation.  The  site  development \ncomponent will cover: (i) documentation of the outcome of the detailed community action plan \n(CAP)  process,  including  titling  arrangements,  and  the  agreements  with  the  land  owners, \ndesigns for local infrastructure and structures with costing and environmental assessment; (ii) \ndesign of livelihood activities where appropriate; and (iii) detailed project and end-financing \nplans,  together  with  agreements  with    participating  financing  institutions  to  undertake  the \nProject. Subproject components will include urban poor housing; urban services (water supply \nand  sanitation);  associated  municipal  infrastructure  (flood  control,  drainage,  roads,  street \nlighting);  social  infrastructure  (health  and  education);  and  other  urban  amenities.  The \n ", "4   \ninfrastructure  component  will  cover  (i) documentation  of  the  required  off-site  infrastructure \ninvestments, (ii) detailed action plans for provision, and (iii) detailed project financing plans for \nthe identified investments. At each stage, all reports will be made accessible through a website \nmaintained by the Project. This will also facilitate feedback on project progress and issues \nencountered.  \n \n12.  In  parallel,  the  TA  will  (i)  review  existing  institutional  arrangements  and  make \nrecommendations  for  an  improved  institutional  framework  for  urban  planning  renewal  and \nmanagement, (ii) assess the information and communications technology (ICT) capacity of \nstakeholders  concerned  for  improved  urban  governance  and  management  in  support  of \ninclusive urban renewal and support for the pilot activities, and (iii) undertake capacity building \nfor key institutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $100,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $900,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 4). The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $700,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $600,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by  \nthe ADB TA Funding Program. The Government will provide the balance of the local currency \ncost, equivalent to $300,000, through payments in kind in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace,  furniture,  administrative  support  services,  and  logistics.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  HUDCC will be the executing agency for the Project. A project management office will be \nestablished by the participating LGUs and will have a project manager, a team of domestic \nconsultants, and counterpart staff with appropriate qualifications and expertise. HUDCC will \nprovide technical, administrative, and logistical support. Subproject offices will be established in \nparticipating LGUs. \n \n15.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be formed and will meet at least bimonthly to \nprovide policy guidance and interagency coordination. The chairperson will be the Secretary of \nHUDCC;10  members  will  include  representatives  of  the  Urban  Asset  Reform  Project \nManagement  Office,  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management,  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources, the Department of Finance, the Department of Interior and \nLocal  Government,  the  Department  of  Justice,  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment, the League of Cities, the Metro Manila Development Authority, the National Anti-\nPoverty Commission, NEDA, the Presidential Commission for Urban Poor, NGOs, community \norganizations, and the private sector.11 A core group, consisting of HUDCC, NEDA, and DBP, to \nbe formed within the PSC, will meet more frequently. LGU commitment has been established \nthrough  consultations  with  city  mayors.  A  working  committee  of  HUDCC  and  LGU \nrepresentatives and other agencies, as determined by the PSC, will be formed under PSC to \nprovide operational guidance. HUDCC will designate a full-time coordinator to supervise and \nmanage the TA, and will assign suitable counterpart staff. \n \n                                                 \n10 Related agencies to be represented include Home Guaranty Corporation, Housing and Land Use Regulatory \nBoard, Land Registration Authority, National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation, and National Housing Authority. \n11 Selection of NGOs, community organizations, and private sector representatives will be based on (i) experience in \nthe urban sector, (ii) existing partnerships with participating LGUs, and (iii) potential to contribute to the TA. \n ", "  5\n16.  A firm of domestic consultants will be engaged using quality and cost-based selection in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the recruitment and engagement of local consultants. All procurement \nunder the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. HUDCC will be responsible for \nproviding the agreed-upon counterpart resources. The TA will require about 76 person-months \nof consulting services. Only domestic consultants are required as significant work has already \nbeen completed under an earlier TA and the required expertise for remaining work exists within \nthe Philippines. Bio-data proposals will be used. The consultants will have expertise in urban \ndevelopment; housing and housing finance; municipal services; GIS and land management; \nurban environmental management; institutional development (financial); taxation, property, and \nland use law; institutional development (urban policies and private sector partnerships); financial \nand economic analysis; and social analyses (Appendix 5). \n \n17.  The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  October  2005  and  to  last  for  12  months,  and  be \ncompleted in September 2006. Part 1 will cover preparations for the Project and packaging of \nhigh-priority  components  for  community-based  urban  upgrading  and  associated  municipal \ninfrastructure in selected LGUs, suitable for external financing. Part 2 will include the supporting \nsector  analysis,  and  agreements  on  and  design  for  the  broader  sectoral  institutional \narrangements.  \n \n18.  In  addition  to  the  strategy,  the  consultants  will  prepare  five  reports:  inception,  two \ninterim,  a  draft  final,  and  a  final  report.  Tripartite  reviews  will  be  conducted  by  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and the consultants to consider the reports. The consultants will conduct two \nseminars for stakeholders to discuss the Project. The first, to be conducted at the beginning of \nPart  1,  will  present  the  project  concept  and  obtain  feedback  and  inputs  for  the  project \npreparation stage. The second will present and discuss the project proposals in the draft final \nreport.  Vehicles,  computers,  and  other  equipment  will  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines, for preparing the Metro Manila Urban Services for the Poor \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nImpact       Assumption \n       \n\u2022 The urban poor and  \u2022 The number of  \u2022 National  \u2022 Willingness to borrow \nvulnerable near poor in  households benefiting  socioeconomic survey  on the part of local \nMetro Manila  from improved housing  \u2022 HUDCC and LGU  governments \nparticipate in and  \u2022 The number of  records   \nbenefit from shelter  households with  \u2022 BSP statistics for  Risks \ndevelopment projects  access to local  financial institutions  \u2022 Adequate revenues of \nand financing.  microcredit  local governments \n  \u2022 Creditworthy local \n  governments  \n\u2022 Lack of political \ncommitment \n \nOutcome       Assumptions \n       \n\u2022 ADB and the  \u2022 The number of poor  Project management  \u2022 Acceptance of targeted \nGovernment agree the  and near poor  unit (PMU) and  and market-friendly \ndesign of integrated  beneficiaries of such  consultant records  subsidy mechanisms. \nurban development  projects    \u2022 Institutional capability \nintervention by LGUs,  \u2022 The number of titles  Surveys undertaken by  and capacity building \nincluding support for  extended to project  other stakeholders and  are effective. \nthe transfer of national  beneficiaries  academic institutions   \ngovernment land to    Risk \nlocal governments.  \u2022 Government provides \nland for new site \ndevelopment. \nOutputs (of the TA)      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Introduction  \n \n1.  At  a  time  when  competition  in  core  urban  areas  between  potentially  high-income \ncommercial and existing low-income space is steadily intensifying, many cities continue to apply \nrigid planning systems that actually promote the high-income over low-income interests. Even if \nplanning systems do have a social element, it is increasingly difficult to meet all the demands to \nchange the use of land and buildings or to meet the needs of all central urban stakeholders.    \n \n2.  While zoning regulations, building codes, and standards all have a vital role to play in \nshaping the way public and private developments occur in cities, it is important that they are part \nof  a  planning  and  development  process  that  seeks  to  promote  greater  integration  and \nneighborhood stability.  It is also vital that planning systems encourage inclusive development \nstrategies that meet the needs of a wide range of urban stakeholders rather than only those with \nshort-term interests in maximizing commercial returns from well-located land.   \n \n3.  With this in mind, a number of countries have introduced systems of innovative land \nredevelopment aimed at reorganizing urban space in an effective and sustainable manner. These \ninclude, for example, the introduction of land sharing and readjustment projects in Indonesia; \nJapan; Republic of Korea; Philippines (Naga City); Taipei,China; and Thailand. \n \n4.  Land sharing is an agreement between the illegal occupants of a piece of land and the \nlandowner. It essentially involves illegal occupants moving off high-value land in return for being \nallowed to either rent or buy a part of the land below its market value. The advantage of such an \nagreement  is  that  it  allows  the  landowner  to  regain  control  of  the  site  and  realize  higher \ncommercial returns from the land without having to evict illegal tenants. In return, illegal residents \ngain legitimate tenure and are able to continue living close to their established livelihoods.  \n \nB.  Principles of Land Sharing  \n \n 5.  Angel and Boonyabancha2 identified several principles involved in land sharing.  \n \n(i)  Community organization: slum dwellers should mobilize and establish indigenous \nleadership to enable them to counter the threat of eviction, negotiate with the land \nowner, enlist the support of outside organizations, and to engage in participatory \nsite planning, allocation of plots, demolition of existing buildings, and rebuilding of \nhouses.  \n(ii)  A land-sharing agreement: a binding agreement to partition the land, which must \nguarantee secure land tenure on the parcels allocated to the residents and may \nspecify  payments  and  time  schedules.  Usually  the  land  with  the  best \ndevelopment potential is allocated to the landlord, while other parts are allocated \nto the existing residents so they can rehouse themselves.  \n(iii)  Densification: redistribution of the land to release land for the landowner usually \nrequires an increase in density, unless significant numbers of existing residents \nare not to be included in the scheme.  \n                                                 \n1 Based on DFID. 2000.

Land sharing should not rely on large subsidies, \nalthough  cross-subsidization  from  development  gains  across  the  site  may \nimprove the viability of the Project. The land-sharing process ensures that the \nresultant housing is affordable and within the residents\u2019 ability to pay. \n \nBox 1: Land Sharing Arrangements in Thailand \n  Klong Toey, a 65-hectare (ha) stretch of land 5 km from Bangkok center, is an \nexample of a successful land-sharing agreement between squatters and the landowner, \nPort Authorities (PAT).a Following eviction notices from PAT in 1973, the squatters, with \nthe help of a local nongovernment organization and the local government, entered into an \nagreement with PAT to lease 10 ha of land to the National Housing Authority (NHA) for a \nperiod of 20 years. The NHA then serviced the sites and leased the land on to the \nsquatters. The agreement allowed PAT to regain control of 55 ha of the 65-ha site for \ncommercial purposes. It also provided the local community, whose livelihoods were tied \nto activities around the harbor area, with a legitimate stake in 10 ha of land for at least an \ninitial 20-year period.b \n________________ \na Tumer, J.

These examples provide evidence that redevelopment through land sharing can be used \nto reorganize valuable urban space in inner city core urban areas in a way that not only satisfies \nthe  commercial  interests  of  the  private  sector  but  also  the  social  interests  of  poor  urban \ncommunities squatting on the land. The importance of active partnerships between the local \ngovernment, the private sector, and the community (supported by NGOs) seem to have been \ninstrumental in the success of land-sharing arrangements in these case studies. However, it \nshould be noted that land-sharing agreements must address the need for stakeholder support; \ndissemination of knowledge and management of the process; and affordability constraints of the \nurban poor. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.
