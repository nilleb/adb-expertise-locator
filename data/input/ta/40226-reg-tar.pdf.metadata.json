As a key instrument in the fight against poverty, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nidentified trade as one of the four pillars of its regional cooperation and integration strategy \nadopted in 2006. The regional cooperation and integration strategy strongly promotes \u201copen \nregionalism\u201d  in  trade.  While  acknowledging  that  the  best  approach  is  a  World  Trade \nOrganization-led  process  of  trade  liberalization,  ADB  recognizes  that  there  are  a  growing \nnumber of free trade agreements (FTAs) in the Asia and Pacific region. The proliferation of \nbilateral and regional FTAs poses new challenges to developing member countries. \n  \n2.  As part of ADB\u2019s mandate to support regional integration and cooperation, a meeting \nbetween the secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and \nsenior ADB officials was held in January 2006 in Davao, Philippines. The meeting identified \npossible areas for ADB support to the ASEAN economic integration process. ADB fielded a \nconsultation mission to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 24 March 2006 to the ASEAN Senior \nEconomic Officials Meeting (SEOM). \n \n3.  Several  activities  were  proposed  and  unanimously  endorsed  by  SEOM  leaders:  \n(i) capacity building and training of senior and mid-level trade officials of ASEAN governments;1 \n(ii) strengthening the Bureau for Economic Integration and Finance at the ASEAN secretariat;2 \nand (iii) strengthening the FTA units3 in ASEAN member countries. During a second ADB\u2013\nSEOM meeting on 31 March 2007, newer ASEAN member countries jointly proposed to ADB a \nregional  trade  capacity  support  program,  within  the  framework  of  the  Initiative  for  ASEAN \nIntegration, tailored to their specific needs and conditions. \n \n4.  The regional technical assistance (RETA)4 will finance the strengthening of the FTA units \nin the newer ASEAN member countries of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), and Viet Nam. The RETA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n5.  ASEAN has been engaged in FTA talks with Australia, People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nJapan, Republic of Korea, and New Zealand, among others. The growing number of FTAs, \nhowever, poses unprecedented challenges to ASEAN member countries because of their varied \nand often limited negotiating capabilities and institutional capacities. There is, therefore, a need \nto enhance the ASEAN countries\u2019 abilities to engage in FTA negotiations and to improve their \nknowledge  of  the  ensuing  economic  restructuring  process,  including  effective  trade-related \nadjustment policies. \n \n6.  This need is most apparent in newer members of ASEAN, Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. These countries require additional knowledge and expertise in FTA-related issues so \nthat they can respond effectively to the increasing number of FTAs with which they are involved, \nso as to maximize benefits and minimize negative effects.  \n                                                 \n1  Three sessions of FTA training courses were conducted under ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Capacity \nBuilding for Designing, Negotiating, and Implementing Free Trade Agreements in Selected Asian Developing \nMember Countries. Manila (RETA 6345). \n2  Currently being implemented under ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Capacity of the ASEAN \nSecretariat in Regional Economic Integration and Policy Dialogue. Manila (RETA 6393). \n3   Created in trade ministries (except those established under finance, economy, or foreign affairs ministries), FTA \nunits are monitoring the implementation of ASEAN FTAs and are also involved in the negotiation process of other \nFTAs. \n4  This RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 September 2007.  \n ", "2   \n7.  ADB has responded previously to the proliferation of FTAs by (i) providing assistance to \ndeveloping member countries to build their institutional capacities to negotiate, structure, and \nimplement appropriate trade arrangements; (ii) acting as a catalyst and coordinator for regional \ncooperation and integration; and (iii) creating and disseminating knowledge and information to \nsupport national and regional efforts, including regional policy initiatives such as the Greater \nMekong Subregion and Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation programs.  \n \n8.  This RETA will focus on strengthening the FTA units in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam.  It  will  take  advantage  of  the  expertise  and  experience  of  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI), which has organized and conducted FTA training courses,5 set up \nan FTA and trade and investment database,6 and prepared a forthcoming manual on how to \ndesign, negotiate, and implement an FTA in Asia.   \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The RETA will enhance the capacity of ASEAN members, in particular Cambodia, Lao \nPDR, and Viet Nam, to respond to trade issues arising from the ASEAN economic integration \nprocess and to cope with and maximize benefits from FTAs and other trade arrangements. The \nexpected outcome is strengthened capacity of the FTA units of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam in negotiating, implementing, and monitoring trade agreements and in forging effective \ntrade-related adjustment policies. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The RETA  will include three major activities: \n \n(i)  holding in-country specialized training courses for the FTA units of Cambodia, \nLao PDR, and Viet Nam;   \n \n(ii)  carrying out case studies and research on trade-related adjustment measures \nand trade-related issues; and  \n \n(iii)  developing  three  country  trade  and  investment  database  structures  to \ncomplement  the  ASEAN  trade  and  investment  database  (where  key \nmacroeconomic, trade, and other regional economic indicators for Cambodia, \nLao PDR, and Viet Nam can be compiled).  \n \n11.  In-Country Specialized Training Courses. A curriculum for a 5-day course on FTAs \nand  specific  topics  such  as  trade  negotiations,  rules  of  origin,  trade  dispute  settlements, \nnontariff barriers, standards, and other trade-related issues will be developed by OREI with the \nassistance of international experts, who will also be used as lecturers and resource persons for \nthe  training.  Building  on  ADB\u2019s  existing  FTA training  program,  database,  and manual,  the \ncourse will cover the economics and scope of FTAs, and strategies for FTA negotiations and \nimplementation with special reference to the needs of the three countries. At least three in-\ncountry training courses will be conducted.  \n                                                 \n5  Three FTA courses were conducted in October 2006, July 2007, and October 2007 at the ADB headquarters in \nManila. About 100 trade officials from 30 developing member countries across Asia participated in the training \nprogram.    \n6  Available at www.aric.adb.org.  ", "  3\n \n12.  The training modules, presentations, and reading materials for each training event will \nbe compiled in a CD-ROM for future reference by the participants and dissemination to their \ncolleagues.   \n \n13.  Case Studies and Research. Topics for studies and research will be identified by ADB \nin  consultation  with  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam,  the  ASEAN \nsecretariat, and ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department. Trade-related adjustment measures will be \ngiven  high  priority.  This  research  will  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  international \nconsultants, think tanks in the countries, and concerned government agencies.  \n \n14.  Development  of  Country  Trade  and  Investment  Database  Structure.  To  assist \nCambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam in consolidating macroeconomic, trade, and investment \nindicators, initial support will be given for developing a database structure and data collection \nmechanism patterned on the database system of the ASEAN secretariat. The country database \nstructure  will  be  compatible  with  the  ASEAN  economic  integration  website  currently  being \ndeveloped  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (footnote  2).  Essential  equipment,  including \ncomputers and software, will be provided to relevant ministries.   \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n15.  The total estimated cost of the RETA is $500,000, funded on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost will cover remuneration, honoraria, travel, and per diem of \nconsultants  and  resource  persons;  training  expenditures;  computers  and  software  for  the \ncountry  database  system;  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nproposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency. OREI will implement the TA in close cooperation with \nthe Southeast Asia Department. There will be collaboration with ADB resident missions and \nhost governments in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, especially on logistics and protocol, \nduring the training courses.  \n \n17.  RETA activities will be implemented with the assistance of international and national \nconsultants and resource speakers. The international consultants will be trade economists and/ \nor macroeconomists and an IT specialist, who will develop the trade and investment database \nstructure in activity 3 (para. 10). A project coordinator and/or economic analyst based in ADB \nheadquarters  will  serve  as  overall  coordinator  of  the  FTA  training  courses  and  assist  the \ninternational consultants in conducting the research studies. Country coordinators and research \nassistants will be hired on an intermittent basis to coordinate activities, including research and \nprocessing of readily available initial data for the country database systems in their countries of \nassignment. In addition, the RETA will engage national resource speakers for the FTA training \ncourses  as  needed.  All  consultants  and  resource  speakers  will  be  engaged  through  the \nindividual consultant\u2019s selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms of \nreference for the consultants and resource speakers are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Three desktop and one laptop computers will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Three desktop computers will \n ", "4   \nbe distributed, one per country, at the beginning of the RETA. One laptop computer will be \nallocated to the project secretariat (based in ADB headquarters). Upon RETA completion, the \nequipment will be turned over to the FTA units in the countries or, if used at ADB, will be turned \nover to ADB.  \n \n19.  The RETA will finance the training expenses for 30 to 35 participants at each in-country \nFTA training, including travel costs and per diem for those not living near the training venue (as \ndetermined by the ADB resident missions in the countries).   \n \n20.  The governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will report regularly to ADB. \nThey will recommend to ADB through OREI the research topics and other activities to be \nundertaken. Consultations between OREI and the governments will be held every 3 months to \nmonitor and evaluate the progress of the RETA.   \n \n21.  The RETA is to be implemented over 24 months, from May 2008 to April 2010.  \n \n22.  SEOM leaders of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam consented to their respective \ncountries\u2019 participation to the RETA in December 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening of the Free Trade Agreement Units of \nSelected ASEAN Member Countries and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \n  \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance   Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n\u2022  Enhanced capacity of  \u2022  Increased knowledge  \u2022  Feedback from  \u2022  Governments\u2019 \nASEAN members, in  and skills of  Cambodia, Lao PDR,  recognition of trade \nparticular Cambodia,  Cambodia, Lao PDR,  and Viet Nam officials   issues in the region \nLao PDR, and Viet  and Viet Nam in  \u2022  ASEAN secretariat\u2019s  and cooperation in \nNam, to respond to  dealing with FTAs  reports on improved  their resolution  \nthe trade issues  \u2022  Active involvement of  participation of  \u2022  Adoption of market-\narising from the  Cambodia, Lao PDR,  Cambodia, Lao PDR,  friendly trade policies   \nASEAN economic  and Viet Nam in trade  and Viet Nam during   \nintegration process  arrangements  trade agreement  Risks \nand to cope with and  involving ASEAN   negotiations  \u2022  Political factors \nmaximize benefits        affecting formation of \nfrom FTAs and other      policies  \ntrade arrangements     \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n\u2022  Strengthened  \u2022  Timely conclusion  \u2022  Review or  \u2022  Effective coordination \ncapacity of FTA units  and implementation of  consultation  among national \nof Cambodia, Lao  trade agreements   meetings   agencies \nPDR, and Viet Nam  \u2022  Effective monitoring  \u2022  Feedback from FTA  \u2022  Strong political \nin negotiating,  and assessment of  dialogue partners  commitment \nimplementing, and  trade-related  \u2022  Availability of trade  \u2022  Sufficient staff \nmonitoring trade  performance   data   resources in trade \nagreements and in  \u2022  Proper identification  \u2022  Project performance  units    \nforging effective  of economic  evaluation report    \ntrade-related  adjustment issues  Risks \nadjustment policies  and exploration of  \u2022  Potential disruption of \n  ways to address them  training due to \n  participants\u2019 urgent \nwork responsibilities \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022  Three in-country  \u2022  High quality and  \u2022  Feedback from  \u2022  Timely identification of \nspecialized training  effective training  training participants  trade issues and \ncourses for FTA units  courses on FTAs and  and resource  needs by the \nof Cambodia, Lao  relevant trade-related  speakers  governments  \nPDR, and Viet Nam  issues    \u2022  Cooperation of \n      government agencies  \n  \u2022  High quality research  \u2022  Consultant reports   \n\u2022  Case studies and  papers     Risks \nresearch on relevant      \u2022  Constraints in \ntrade-related issues       obtaining relevant \n  \u2022  Functional and  \u2022  ASEAN statistics   information \n\u2022  Country trade and   accessible trade and   \u2022  Reports of national  \u2022  Unavailability of \ninvestment  database   investment database  statistics offices    required data  \n       \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs   \n1.1  Consultations with Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam governments in      \u2022 People\u2019s Republic of \n       May\u2013June 2008  China Regional \n1.2  Selection of topics for the training course   Cooperation and \n1.3  Selection and engagement of training consultants and resource speakers   Poverty Reduction \n1.4  Holding of the training course in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam   Fund administered \n1.5  Evaluation of training course by participants and relevant   by ADB ($500,000) \n       ministry from host country  \u2022 Consultancy and \n  resource persons \n2.1  Consultation with Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam on relevant topics  costs ($334,050) \n2.2  Selection and engagement of consultants  \u2022 Training and meeting \n2.3  Preparation of case studies and research papers  expenditures \n2.4  Review and dissemination of reports  ($96,950) \n   \u2022 Equipment ($9,000) \n3.1 Turning over of computer units  \n\u2022 Publication and \n3.2 Development of database system on trade and investment \nprinting costs \n3.3 Coordination with relevant agencies from Cambodia, Lao PDR, and  \n($5,000) \n      Viet Nam  \n\u2022 Miscellaneous \nadministrative and \nsupport costs \n($5,000) \n\u2022 Contingencies \n($50,000) \n\u2022 ADB staff support \n\u2022 Logistical support \nfrom country \ngovernments  \n \nTotal cost: $500,000 \nADB = Asian Development Bank;
