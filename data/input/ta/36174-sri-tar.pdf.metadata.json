At the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Fact-Finding Mission from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) visited Sri Lanka on 22\u201326 August 20051 to formulate an advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) for strengthening local government infrastructure financing through \nthe Local Loans and Development Fund (LLDF).2 The strengthening of LLDF is much needed \nfor  implementing  the  planned  ADB  Local  Government  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project \n(LGIIP).3 The  Mission  held  discussions  with  responsible  officials  of  agencies  concerned, \nincluding the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP), Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local \nGovernment (MPCLG) and institutions under its purview, LLDF, and development partners. \nDuring the project preparatory TA for the LGIIP, the survey results from close to 200 local \nauthorities were collected and local authority needs for infrastructure investment were analyzed. \nThe present TA was developed on the basis of understanding reached during the Mission and \nthe  Government\u2019s  concurrence  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements; cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference (Appendix 1). 4  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n2.  Need for Infrastructure Development. The Government places importance on steady \neconomic growth, continuing macroeconomic stability, strong exports and imports, and inward \nforeign direct investment. Higher growth ensures greater government revenues and domestic \nsavings. Higher levels of production, productivity, and wages mean stronger consumer spending \nand greater purchasing power and enhanced ability of households, businesses, and institutions \nto pay for high-quality urban infrastructure services and other local government services. There \nwill be a desire and demand for much better natural and urban environments and a better \nquality of life.  Higher growth, personal incomes, purchasing power, and expectations from all \ncitizens, business, and other stakeholders will place increasing pressures on governments to \nimprove health, education, and the provision of other public goods. Appendix 2 gives the initial \npoverty and social analysis. \n \n3.  Local Loans and Development Fund. LLDF is a statutory body established under  \nLocal Loans and Development Ordinance No. 22 of 1916 and is one of the oldest financial \nestablishments in Sri Lanka. The Ordinance has been amended from time to time.5 LLDF is \nadministered by the local loans and development commissioners, and is a separate legal entity \nset up and operating under an Act of Parliament.  Currently functioning under MPCLG, LLDF\u2019s \nprime objective is to meet the capital investment needs of the local authorities (LAs) through \nlending. LLDF advances loans to LAs at a concessionary or market-based rate of interest, \ndepending on the type of investment, as well as to any person or body for any purpose of public \nutility subject to limits on the borrowing powers of the lender.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Fact-Finding Mission for this TA coincided with the Appraisal Mission of a linked ADB. 2005.

Manila states water supply and \nsanitation projects as priorities in para. 10.  The proposed advisory technical assistance (ADTA) was not included \nin the original ADB. 2004.

The Vice \nPresident\u2019s approval of the TA concept paper was cleared on 4 October 2005.   \n5  Ordinance No. 22 of 1916 has been amended several times, the latest by Act No. 24 of 1993.  ", "2   \n4.  Scarcity of Funds for Local Government Basic Services Development. LAs in Sri \nLanka have been largely dependent on grants received from provincial councils (PCs) to meet \ntheir recurrent expenses; the balance is met out of own revenues. As a general trend, most LAs \nare unable to meet even the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of existing assets as a \nlarge portion of their funds are diverted to pay for salaries and administration costs.6 LAs also \ndepend on the national Government for assistance in undertaking capital projects, including \nthrough LLDF.7 Thus, LAs have little or no fund to take up new capital projects on their own. The \nsituation has put a strain on existing infrastructure services, and the gap between demand and \nsupply of infrastructure has been ever-widening. LAs are forced to look at alternative sources of \nfinancing to provide infrastructure, but their choices are currently restricted. LLDF is a major \nsource where the private banking industry does not yet provide long-term infrastructure finance \nin Sri Lanka.  \n \n5.  Need for Strengthening Institutional Capacity. Lack of capacity and low levels of \nexpertise for project formulation and appraisal in LLDF have placed serious limitations on its \neffective functioning. Presently, the executive body consists of a chief executive officer, his \ndeputy, and a few support staff. The team does not have a very high level of technical expertise \nappraising the technical and commercial viability of infrastructure-related project proposals, as \nwell as LA financial capacity to repay the loan amount. LLDF lacks any operational guidelines \non  project  evaluation,  lending  policies  and  criteria,  safeguard  policies,  human  resource \ndevelopment.  Low  staff  numbers  and  expertise  have  also  resulted  in  basic  treasury \nmanagement, which is key to the success of any municipal financial funding agency. Beyond \ninstitutional strengthening measures, there is an urgent need for undertaking staff training, \nincluding knowledge transfer workshops.  \n \n6.  Poor  Commercial  Orientation.  Most  loans  disbursed  by  LLDF  to  LA  have  been \nextended at a concessionary rate of interest. This practice has sent wrong signals to LAs, who \nhave  become  complacent  in  loan  repayment.  LLDF  now  needs  to  move  toward  market \nmechanisms to ensure stronger financial discipline. Unlike other nodal funds in neighboring \ncountries such as the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF), and Karnataka Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Finance  Corporation  (KUIDFC)  in  India,  LLDF  has  not  been \nsuccessful in marketing itself at the provincial and local levels and is also plagued by lack of \ncommercial success of projects. Further, using LLDF loans for developing employment and \nrevenue-generating projects has been limited.  \n \n7.  Weak Enforcement. Traditionally, LLDF has been weak in terms of loan repayments \nand defaults. Although the LLDF Ordinance has built in a strong recovery mechanism to ensure \nno defaults in repayment of loans or misapplication of loans, there have been problems in \nexercising such powers due to reasons leading to a large number of defaults by LAs. These are \nthe main reasons: (i) LLDF was brought into those projects merely as a debt collecting agency, \nand was not involved when loan applications were appraised; and (ii) the executing agencies of \npast ADB projects were different from MPCLG [e.g., Urban Development Authority (UDA)] that \nthere was confusion in the decision-making authorities and responsibilities. LLDF made a total \nprovision of SLRs14.3 million for bad debts clearly highlighting its inability to recover loan \n                                                 \n6  While the central government has been reimbursing 100% of these costs, in 2005 it indicated it will reduce the \nsubsidy to 80%.  \n7  In 2003, transfers to local governments and provincial councils for capital expenditures amounted to only 1.2% of \nthe total central budget, or about SLRs5.4 billion. This averages SLRs17.3 million per local authority ($174,000). \nSource: ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the Basic \nSocial Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (PPTA 4296-SRI). \n ", "  3\namounts at the end of year 2003. LLDF\u2019s record in recovering loans for ADB-financed projects \nhas been mixed.  \n \n8.  Lack of Alternative Sources of Financing. Unlike most other nodal funds in the region, \nLLDF is totally dependent on the Government for funding. There is a need to explore other \noptions\u2014like  accessing  commercial  banks,  capital  market  (bond  issues),  borrowings  from \nLAs\u2014 and develop credit enhancement measures like LA credit rating, setting up of escrow \nmechanisms, partial/full guarantees by PCs, debt service reserve funds, LLDF guarantees, etc. \nA diversified borrowing portfolio will make LLDF more responsive to market-driven borrowing \nand lending rates, and enable it to evolve into a long-term financial entity based on commercial \nprinciples. \n \n9.   Holistic Strengthening in Local Government Financing. It is clear that in Sri Lanka, \nfinancing of local government infrastructure needs a comprehensive review and strengthening. \nLLDF needs clear and transparent infrastructure project financing operational guidelines that \ninclude (i) definitions relevant to infrastructure financing; (ii) a thorough credit appraisal; (iii) \nminimum information requirements for a thorough appraisal, in particular the detailed feasibility \nreport for the proposed infrastructure projects; (iv) separate risk assessment and risk mitigation \nstrategies; (v) need for project escrow accounts for monitoring the repayment of debt, (vi) \nguarantee or collateral arrangements and security packages; (vii) special regulatory compliance \nmeasures in providing infrastructure project financing, such as exposure limits, maximum debt-\nequity ratio for borrowers, maximum (10\u201320 years) duration of infrastructure loans; and (viii) \nother socioeconomic requirements. In addition, there is a need for the following: (i) further \nstrengthening institutional capacity within provincial and local governments to develop, analyze, \nand  prepare  bankable  projects  and  to  structure  tender,  evaluate,  contract,  negotiate \ninfrastructure/civil works projects; (ii) training and capacity building for officials to oversee and \nmanage civil works project preparation, development, and oversight; (iii) standardized analytical \ntool kits for selecting, analyzing, structuring, tendering, evaluating, and negotiating projects; (iv) \nfunds  to  pay  for  effective  private-sector  participation  in  project  preparation  to  bankable \nstandards, and for transaction advisory services; (v) creating a long-term, fixed-rate Sri Lanka \nrupee-based financing for infrastructure investments.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n10.  The primary objective of the TA is to provide capacity building for LLDF to equip it with a \nnecessary business plan, guidelines, operational manuals and various model loan agreements \nto be able to perform the functions and responsibilities of a nodal agency in providing loans to \nLAs for municipal infrastructure services. The TA also aims to help LLDF meet the disbursement \nconditions for the infrastructure8 financing component of ADB\u2019s LGIIP, which is expected to \nbegin in 2006. The main outputs of the TA will be (i) a code of conduct; (ii) a business plan, \nspanning at least 5 years that would cover the vision of becoming an independent full-fledged \nLA  nodal  fund,  including    human  resources  and  institutional  strengthening  to  expand  the \nservices; (iii) operational guidelines in the immediate term for ADB\u2019s LGIIP for appraising LA \nproposals  (lending  policy),  and  disbursing  and  repayment  procedures;  (iv)  model  legal \ndocuments,  including  model  loan  agreements  with  LAs,  PC  guarantee  agreement,  model \nperformance agreement with LAs for a grant component; (v) organization chart and training \n                                                 \n8  Infrastructure includes (i) water and sanitation; (ii) urban road, drainage; (iii) solid waste; and (iv) health clinic, \nlibrary, parks. ", "4   \nneeds assessment for LLDF staff to meet these objectives; (vi) financial projections for 10 years \ncommencing 2006; and (vii) future business expansion recommendations.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The TA will have three main components: (i) development of a strategic business plan to \ndefine the expansion of LLDF role of providing various financial means to assist LAs to avail \nfinancing for infrastructure; (ii) capacity building including workshops and study visits for LLDF \nmanagement  and  staff,  central  government  agencies  (including  MoFP,  central  bank,  and \nMPCLG officials), PC and LA decision makers and financial management staff to learn about \nthe potential for LA infrastructure financing; and (iii) assessment of LA needs and development \nof practical operational guidelines. \n \n12.  Component 1 will (i) set up a long-term vision of LLDF; how it would evolve into a full- \nfledged financing institution gradually expanding business services and financing tools, and (ii) \ndevelop  a  business  plan  for  LLDF  for  the  first  5  years  (2006\u20132010)  including  financial \nprojections. Component 2 will examine best practices suitable for Sri Lanka in the area of \nspecialized  financial  intermediaries  in  LA  infrastructure  and  services.  The  component  will \ninclude  workshops  to  disseminate  best  practices,9 on-the-job  training  for  LLDF  staff  on \ninfrastructure project appraisal, study tours to actually learn from similar infrastructure financing \ninstitution\u2019s daily work responsibilities and institutional arrangements with Indian cases (e.g., \nKarnataka, Tamil Nadu), and knowledge transfer and exchanges for key national/provincial and \nLLDF staff. Component 3 will include (i) preliminary assessment of infrastructure and services \nneeds for 68 LAs to be targeted in the ADB LGIIP; and (ii) development of a detailed operational \nmanual for LLDF including administrative structure, project appraisal guidelines, on safeguards \npolicy, lending policy and criteria, human resources, and recruitment policy.  \n \n13.  All proposed activities will be carried out in collaboration with MPCLG, LLDF, relevant \ngovernment agencies, and the private sector that has potential for cooperating with LLDF \nmandates (e.g. chamber of commerce). An effort will also be made to create strong linkages \nwith other capacity-building programs conducted by other funding agencies operating in Sri \nLanka in the area of urban infrastructure and service delivery support.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $667,000 equivalent of which $392,800 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $274,200 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$107,200 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto $167,000 through the provision of office accommodation, utilities, remuneration of counterpart \nstaff, local transportation, surveys, and workshops (See Appendix 3 for details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan).     \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  MPCLG will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and LLDF is the Implementing Agency \n(IA). LLDF will set up a TA implementing unit; appoint a manager10 for the unit; and provide \n                                                 \n9  Best practices were collected and studied during the preparation of ADB, 2005,  Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for \nthe Local Government Infrastructure Improvement Project.

The Government will set up a \nTA steering committee (TASC), 11 with the Secretary MPCLG as chair to periodically review TA \nprogress and resolve any issues that may arise. The TASC will have representatives from all \nthe ministries and agencies mentioned in this para. including the chief secretaries of eight \nprovinces.12   \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months from April to September, 2006 through an \ninternational consulting firm. The consulting team (with person-months in parentheses) will have \nthe  following  international  consultants  with  total  input  of  15  person-months:  (i)  municipal \ninfrastructure finance specialist/team leader (6), (ii) capacity building specialist (4), (iii) financial \nanalyst (3), and (iv) legal specialist (2). The domestic consultants will provide 15 person-months \nof input: (i) municipal infrastructure engineer (6), (ii) financial management specialist (3), (iii) \ncapacity  building/training  expert  (4),  plus  drawdown  support  provision  of  2  person-months \n(covering social development and  safeguards issues). All consultants will be selected and \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. Terms of \nreference for the consulting services are in Appendix 4. The simplified technical proposal format \nand the quality and cost-based selection method will be used. Office equipment will be procured \nby the respective consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. After the \nProject, the equipment will be handed over and retained by LLDF. \n \n17.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  activities, \nissues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, three major reports will be \nsubmitted. An inception report, to be submitted no later than 3 weeks after fielding of the \nconsultants, will provide a detailed work program and establish time-bound outputs. A draft final \nreport will be submitted 10 weeks after inception. The Government and ADB will give comments \non the draft final report. The final report will be submitted within 3 weeks after receipt of \ncomments from ADB review.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for Strengthening Local Government Infrastructure Financing, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n11  The number of agencies in the TA steering committee will be less than the ones for SRI-35201 LGIIP Loan. MoFP-\nERD is to give guidance on overall external assistance, UDA and NWSDB on relevant infrastructure strategy, \nNPPD on national planning aspects.  \n12  ADB members may attend steering committee meetings if the review mission coincides with the meetings.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka:  \n \nUsing the national poverty linea the proportion of the Sri Lankan population classified as poor was 22.7% in 2002. While \nincome poverty in Sri Lanka appears to be low, nonincome poverty appears to be increasing. Basic urban infrastructure is \ngenerally in poor condition and deteriorating. Approximately 30% of the population lack access to safe drinking water, \n24% to safe sanitation facilities, and 56% to hygienic toilets. Inadequate sanitation is a leading cause of public health \nproblems in communities. Poor and deficient basic urban infrastructure hinders improvement in the livelihood of poor \ncommunities. Studies identify that the poor from the lowest income quintile groups, estate plantation labor communities, \nsmall rural agricultural communities, and war-affected internally displaced persons are among those most seriously \naffected by a lack of basic urban infrastructure. Consumption data show that in the poorest quintile (average monthly \nhousehold consumption of SLRs821) only 61% have access to safe drinking water compared with the richest quintile with \n89% having access; only 55% of the poorest quintile have access to safe sanitation compared with 89% in the richest, \nand only 84% of the poorest quintile have access to latrines compared with 94% in the richest. \n \nThe disparity in household incomes is growing. The Gini concentration ratiob increased from 0.43 in 1980 to 0.47 in 2002. \nIncome varies widely between urban and rural areas with average monthly household income in the rural areas of \nSLRs11,712 (2002)\u2014only half of its urban counterpart SLRs22,420 (2002). Intraprovincial inequality is high: the average \nhousehold monthly income of the poorest province of Sabaragamuwa (SLRs8,439) is only 48% that of its Western \nProvince counterpart (SLRs17,732). Basic urban infrastructure is unequally distributed. This exacerbates the slow \neconomic growth and social development experienced by poor regions. The higher degrees of poverty experienced in \nSabaragamuwa, Uwa, and conflict-affected northeast provinces illustrates this. Most of these areas are considered rural \nand are administered by rural local authorities (LAs) or pradeshiya sabhas. More than 80% of Sri Lanka\u2019s poor live in \npradeshiya sabahs. While national average levels of access to basic urban infrastructure, access to safe sanitation, \ndrinking water, toilets, and health services is low, these are even poorer in pradeshiya sabahs, especially when compared \nwith that in urban and relatively developed regions such as Western Province. \n \nImproving basic urban infrastructure will result in directly reducing nonincome poverty, and is likely to result in indirectly \nreducing income poverty through human development and associated economic growth. The Project is designed to assist \nselected LAs in developing management capabilities, and strengthening capacity in the delivery of community-prioritized \nbasic urban services. It will also improve and expand basic urban infrastructure and services particularly in the categories \nof (i) community water supply and sanitation, (ii) access and LA roads, (iii) solid waste management, (iv) drainage \nimprovements, and (v) institutional infrastructure (health, education, common community facilities, and administrative \nfacilities).  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nNationally, the poverty headcount does not appear very high at 22.7%. However, large differences in poverty are found \nacross the country. The poverty levels for rural and urban populations for example are 24.7% and 7.9%, respectively. \nSome differences are found in income inequality between rural and urban areas with Gini concentration ratios of 0.46 and \n0.48, respectively. In 2002, poverty headcounts in the region varied. The lowest level of poverty was in the Western \nProvince, where the poverty headcount was only 9.2%. In comparison, the poverty in Uva was 31.8%, Sabaragamuwa \n28.9%, Southern 23.6%, North Western 22.3%, Central 20.8%, and North Central 18.1%.c  When examined by district, the \nvariability increases further with poverty headcounts ranging from 32.4% in Moneragalato 5.0% in Colombo; and Gini \nconcentration ratios ranging from 0.56 in Moneragala to 0.40 in Nuwara Eliya, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa.  \n \nAside from the relatively high levels of poverty and income inequality in certain districts and provinces, the income \nstructure is such that a large number of the population are near-poverty. When poverty is defined using two poverty lines, \n1996 data show that a higher poverty line of SLRs950 classifies 26% as poor; while a lower poverty line of SLRs791 \nclassifies 19% as poor.d  This shows that although the number of core poor may not be so high, a large number of near-\npoor are highly vulnerable. This is significant considering the high dependence on the primary sector, and one event such \nas a natural calamity can result in poverty due to loss of productive assets.  \n \nThis vulnerability is further aggravated by the lack of basic urban infrastructure. A high degree of nonincome poverty \nresults from the lack of basic urban infrastructure; access varies widely across provinces and districts. Using water and ", "  Appendix 2  9\nsanitation as an example, while 95.8% of the population in Colombo have access to safe drinking water, only 58.6% of \nthe population in Ratnapura have access.e Similarly 97.6% of the population in Matara have latrine facilities while only \n28.4% in Batticaloa have such facilities.  \n \nA field-level analysis was conducted in 22 LAs through (i) information collection from LAs; (ii) key informant interviews in \nLAs; (iii) focus group discussions with stakeholders including subproject beneficiaries, community-based and other civic \norganizations,  and  basic  urban  service  providers;  (iv)  participatory  needs  assessment  aimed  at  identifying  basic \ninfrastructure needs and priorities; (v) strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis involving stakeholders; and \n(vi) questionnaire for potential beneficiaries. The analysis shows that poor households have very limited access to basic \nurban infrastructure. For example, the analysis shows that a third of the lowest-income households, with average monthly \nhousehold incomes of less than SLRs1,000, have no access to safe drinking water. Of these low-income households only \n50% had access to sanitation.  \n \nParticipatory  assessment  identifies  improved  drinking  water  supply  and  access  roads  for  improved  economic \nopportunities as the most important needs of LAs, particularly in rural areas. Eight of 22 LAs surveyed (37%) identified \nwater supply as their first priority while 18% identified access roads. The lack of access to safe drinking water required \nhouseholds to spend considerable time and effort in fetching water. This burden was especially pronounced for poor \nhouseholds and female members of these households. Public health issues arise from the use of unprotected water \nsources for drinking\u2014this increases the burden on poor households. Inadequate access roads limit the marketing of \nproduce from poor communities. The lack of access roads also increases the difficulties in accessing basic urban \ninfrastructure such as health centers and schools. Children in poor communities walk several kilometers to attend school. \nThe participatory needs assessment also identified the need for sanitation, drainage, improved solid waste management, \nand improved institutional infrastructure.  \n \nBy strengthening LA capacity and providing basic urban infrastructure, an enabling environment will be created for \ndelivering basic infrastructure services in a sustained manner. The Project\u2019s LA selection criteria ensure that the Project \nwill consider and prioritize LAs where poverty is high and basic infrastructure services are lacking. The Project provides \ndirect benefits through increased access to basic urban infrastructure and services, and enhances the potential for \ninvestments and economic growth in poor areas. Key benefits expressed by stakeholders include enabling small \nproducers to market products without experiencing hardships and exploitation from agents and reduced social exclusion \nwith increased transportation and mobility from access roads; increased time for productive labor for income generation; \nand improved health from improved access to drinking water. Solid waste subprojects will provide better waste disposal \nfacilities to nearly half of the LA population. Water supply and sanitation subprojects are aimed at serving at least one fifth \nof the LA population currently severely constrained due to lack of access to or the poor quality of current infrastructure \nand services. The Project, through the provision of basic urban infrastructure and  services,  will promote human \ndevelopment  envisioned  to  enable  the  poor  to  take  advantage  of  potential  social  and  economic  resources  and \nopportunities. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                           Yes     No \n \nExtensive community consultation was undertaken in 22 representative LAs. This included (i) information collection from \nLAs; (ii) key informant interviews in 22 LAs; (iii) focus group discussions in 22 LAs involving 357 stakeholders such as \nsubproject beneficiaries (including potentially vulnerable groups such as poor and low income groups); nongovernment, \ncommunity-based, and other civic organizations; and basic urban service providers; (iv) participatory needs assessment \naimed at identifying basic infrastructure needs and priorities through 16 group discussions; (v) analysis of strengths, \nweaknesses, opportunities, and threats in 12 LAs involving stakeholders; and (vi) questionnaire for 234 potential \nbeneficiaries. These activities aimed at ascertaining stakeholders\u2019 response to improved infrastructure services; the \ncommunities\u2019 needs and demands; affordability; and impacts on women, indigenous people, estate plantation workers, \ndifferent ethnicities, small farmers, and other disadvantaged groups. Community and stakeholder consultations reveal the \nfollowing: (i) better access roads will give the poor access to services, decrease travel time, and provide better access to \nmarkets and educational facilities; this is perceived as a major project benefit; (ii) safe drinking water saves time for \nwomen for additional income-earning opportunities, and improve health and hygienic conditions; these are perceived to \nbe major project benefits; (iii) communities are prepared to pay for improved services, and the operation and maintenance \nof subprojects; and (iv) they perceive that increased access to services will reduce poverty and improve quality of life. \n \nIs there a participation strategy:                                  Yes     No \n \nMuch of the Project will be implemented through stakeholder participation and consultations using a community-driven \napproach (including United Nations Development Programme and United Nations-Habitat Sustainable Cities Program). \nSubproject identification, formulation, design, and selection will be carried out through community consultations. During \nthe social analysis, community preferences were identified. Local participation in the subprojects through active civic and ", "10    Appendix 2 \ncommunity-based  organizations  will  be  encouraged.  During  the  field  analysis  some  active  local  nongovernment \norganizations were found to be engaged in solid waste management, recycling, and implementation of low-cost sanitation \nand  toilet  facilities  in  some  LAs.  Beneficiary  participation  and  the  involvement  of  all  stakeholders  including \nnongovernment, civic, and community-based organizations will promote a bottom- up participatory process, proven \neffective and successful in other ongoing aid-supported projects in the sector.   \n \nD.  Gender and Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nNational indicators show that women in Sri Lanka have an equivalent status to men in terms of education (literacy rate for \nwomen is 89.2% compared with men at 92.3%; net enrolment ratio for girls is 95.6% for ages 6\u201310 and 97.1% for boys), \nhealth (life expectancy is 76.4 for women, 71.7 for men; infant mortality is 15.6 per 1,000 girls, 22.6 per 1,000 boys), and \npoverty (percentage of poor households headed by women is 21.5% compared with 23.0% for households headed by \nmen). However, the labor force participation rate for women is only 33.6% compared with 67.9% for men, and female \nprofessional and technical workers comprise only 22.9% of total workers. \n \nFocus group discussions and field investigations show that in the project areas, women bear the primarily responsibility \nfor managing the domestic environment. Their tasks include water collection and ensuring solid waste disposal. The \nProject will benefit women largely through reduced time for collecting water and other household chores related to \ndisposing of solid waste. This reduces their burden from manual work, increases time for productive activities, which will \nraise household income and potentially their status in the household, and increase social and leisure time. Other \nexternally supported projects (including United Nations Development Programme and United Nations-Habitat Sustainable \nCities Program) in Sri Lanka have consistently demonstrated that women in poverty reduction programs involving water \nsupply, sanitation, and microfinance have elicited women\u2019s active participation and benefited women. Other benefits from \nthe Project are likely to benefit women and men equally. Subproject design will ensure women are provided equal access \nto potential skills training and employment opportunities, and promote women\u2019s active participation in community-based \nbasic urban infrastructure provision and management. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
