INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2017, the Economics and Research Department (ERD) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will commemorate ADB\u2019s 50th anniversary with the study Five Decades of Asian \nDevelopment. Its main purpose is to assess Asia\u2019s development from the mid-1960s to the \npresent and outline key challenges for the future. This analysis is very important, both for ADB \nas a knowledge institution, and for its member countries as they seek to implement relevant \ndevelopment lessons. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The publication in 1968 of Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal\u2019s major work \u201cAsian Drama\u201d \ncoincided with the beginning of ADB operations. Myrdal painted a very pessimistic view of the \nprospects of seven South and Southeast Asian countries: India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, \nPakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.2 Decolonization, which began in the years following \nWorld War II, brought very positive expectations. At that time, it was argued that colonialism \nwas the cause of poverty in these countries. As a consequence, it was expected that the end of \ncolonialism would enable economic progress and reduce the gulf between rich and poor nations. \nIt was thought that the \u201cadvantages of backwardness\u201d would play a significant role as the \ntechnologies of the Industrial Revolution were at their disposal.3 \n \n3.  However, these expectations were not realized during the two decades following the end \nof World War II. Despite government efforts and international assistance, per capita output \nhardly rose in these countries, and the gap with the developed world increased. By the mid-\n1960s, there was a recognition by economists that their profession had failed to convincingly \nexplain differences in economic growth rates between countries. \n \n4.  Myrdal believed that traditional power structures were likely to persist, and that, in the \nabsence  of  change,  rapid  economic  development  was  unlikely.  He  also  believed  that \ngovernments in the region were unable to enforce the discipline needed to implement their \ndevelopment  plans.  Myrdal  doubted  that  faster  agricultural  development  would  take  place \nwithout radical land distribution, although he acknowledged such distribution would be difficult. \nHe also believed that industrialization would be restrained by shortages of foreign exchange \nresulting from poor export prospects, inward investment, and foreign aid. He favored economic \nplanning, but was aware of the extensive corruption and waste in the region. Finally, Myrdal \nargued that education, health, and population control should be given greater priority. Overall, \nMyrdal thought that economic development could not advance, and much less succeed, in poor \nnations without social reforms to motivate millions of people to become workers. \n \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 October \n2014. \n2  Malaysia, Myanmar and Sri Lanka were known at that time as Malaya, Burma and Ceylon, respectively. Events of \nthis period include the split of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965; General Park Chung-hee\u2019s seizure of power \nthrough a military coup in the Republic of Korea in 1961; and the Great Leap Forward (1958\u20131961) and the \nCultural Revolution (1966\u20131976) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n3  The expression \u201cadvantages of backwardness\u201d refers to the fact that countries below those at the technological \nfrontier do not need to invent the technologies that are already publicly available in the market. An example is the \nmachinery that developed-country companies invent (e.g., for construction). Developing countries have to buy it \nand learn how to use it, but not invent it. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  Although Myrdal\u2019s work was praised as a tour de force in economic development, it was \nalso  deemed  unduly  pessimistic.4 It  was  received  in  Western  industrialized  nations  with \ndiscomfort, for fear  that  Myrdal  may  have  implied  that the millions  spent  on  development \nfollowing the end of World War II had been wasted, and that aid-financed industrialization \nprojects were enclaves. Likewise, it caused consternation in developing Asia for fear that Myrdal \nmay have implied that Asians were responsible for own underdevelopment. \n \n6.  In  fact,  Asia  has  changed  dramatically  since  the  mid-1960s,  and  its  remarkable \neconomic  progress  has  gained  global  admiration,  in  particular  as  a  group  of  East  Asian \neconomies registered historically unprecedented growth rates that lifted millions of people out of \npoverty.5 However, it is important to stress that there have been significant differences in the \nachievements  of  Asian  economies.  For  example,  in  1960\u20131965,  India,  Indonesia,  and  the \nRepublic of Korea had similar gross domestic product per capita (in purchasing power parity \nterms), Indonesia being the highest. Between 1966 and 1996, Indonesian living standards grew \nmuch more rapidly than India\u2019s, while the growth in living standards in the Republic of Korea \nsurpassed  those  in  both  India  and  Indonesia.  The  result  is  that  the  Republic  of  Korea \ntransitioned from a lower middle-income into a high-income economy in just 26 years (during \n1969\u20131995), more rapidly than any other economy in history.6 The great achievements made by \nEast Asian economies gave rise to the hope that other less-developed economies could achieve \nsimilar success. Myrdal clearly underestimated the potential for exports and investment, and \nseemed unaware of the potential of high-yielding seeds for rice and other food grains being \ndeveloped in places such as Mexico and the Philippines. Overall, he took too static a view of \ntraditional societies. Today, less-developed countries in Asia continue to seek to emulate the \nsuccessful East Asian economies. \n \n7.  During the five decades following ADB\u2019s inauguration in 1967, Asia and the Pacific has \nundergone significant changes. For example, ADB\u2019s first President Takeshi Watanabe recalled \nin his diary (published in English in 1977) challenges of Asian development as a rationale for the \ncreation of ADB: (i) large, low-productivity agricultural sectors; (ii) the imperative to industrialize; \n(iii) the need for technical assistance (TA) and know-how; and (iv) high population growth. Some \nof these remain, and others have emerged (e.g., inequality and environmental degradation). \n \n8.  Likewise, while development economics was an emerging field in the late 1960s, it is \nnow a well-established field within economics, and some eminent development scholars have \nbeen awarded the Nobel Prize (e.g., Lewis, Myrdal, and Sen). Development economics is an \napplied  field,  and  policy  recommendations  to  developing  countries  by  both  international \norganizations and scholars have changed significantly during this period, with important debates \non key themes such as balanced growth versus big push, the stages of development, rent-\nseeking,  inflation,  unemployment  and  underemployment,  wage  rigidities,  migration,  rural \nmarkets, the resurgence of growth in the form of the endogenous growth models, the role of \nmarkets and governments in development, and the importance of governance issues. \n \n                                                \n4  Agreement with Myrdal\u2019s assessment\u2014in particular, with his recommendations\u2014was not universal. An early \ncriticism of the Asian Drama was that it provided an in-depth analysis of what was wrong, and not of how Asia\u2019s \nproblems could be solved. \n5  These are Hong Kong, China; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. By comparison, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have achieved much more limited success. \n6  Only Taipei,China matches this record. Both India and Indonesia are still lower middle-income economies. J. \nFelipe, U. Kumar, and R. Galope. 2014. Middle Income Transitions: Trap or Myth? ADB Economics Working Paper \n421. Manila. \n ", "3 \n \n9.  Although much has been written about Asia\u2019s success during the last five decades, \nassessments have often been biased, highlighting East Asia\u2019s success. Only Japan and four \nmore recently industrialized economies\u2014Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; \nand Taipei,China\u2014have achieved high-income status. A cursory analysis of the region suggests \nthat a distinguishing feature is its tremendous heterogeneity. While Japan and the four more \nrecently industrialized countries are high-income economies\u2014known as the Asian miracle\u2014the \nrest of the countries in the region are middle- and low-income economies. Even Indonesia, \nMalaysia, and Thailand, which did well up to the mid-1990s, have apparently lost momentum, \nwith much slower growth after the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis.  Moreover, agriculture remains a \nvery large employer across the South Asian subcontinent, and even in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, it still employs about a third of all workers. \nFinally, it has also been observed that many Asian countries are experiencing a transition from \nagriculture into low-productivity services (the largest employer in many Asian countries), rather \nthan industrializing. It appears that industrialization of the type undergone by the Republic of \nKorea in the 1970s is not taking place in most Asian countries today. Instead, many countries \nare undergoing \u201cpremature non-industrialization,\u201d7 which leaves no obvious alternative strategy \nfor developing into high-income economies. Overall, the performance of most of Asia since the \nmid-1960s has not been miraculous. This applies to large economies (e.g., Bangladesh, India, \nPakistan, and the Philippines); the small economies of Southeast Asia (Cambodia, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam); countries in Central Asia that were \npart of the former Soviet Union; and the Pacific island countries. \n \n10.  A consensus is emerging in the literature that, given the difficulties that many countries \nwill likely face in their quest to industrialize in the 21st century, economic transformation in many \nparts of developing Asia may continue taking the form of a shift toward services. While the \nimpact of the revolution in information technology will be significant, and will positively impact \nproductivity,8 technological progress will continue to have extreme labor-saving impacts in some \nareas, at least in the short to medium term. This will be disruptive. If this results in significant \nshares of employment being concentrated in low-productivity activities, the implication is that \nemployment will be increasingly polarized, with a few workers taking \u201cgood\u201d jobs and a large \nmajority performing labor-intensive activities that pay low wages.9 This does not mean that \ntechnological development is bad for Asia, as it clearly drives progress, but the challenges for \nmany governments will be enormous. They will need to be aware of the implications of this \ndevelopment model and act accordingly to mitigate problems\u2014for example, by focusing on \nraising productivity and increasing the employability of less-skilled workers. \n \nIII.

There is a wealth of material regarding this subject; the distinctive feature of this \nproject will be the aim to discuss how Asia\u2019s development experience has impacted the fields of \ndevelopment economics and growth. To accomplish this project, we expect to collaborate with \nscholars of repute. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have two key outputs with separate delivery dates: a high-level conference, \nand a book. The conference, planned for 2015, will serve as a venue for scholars, policy makers, \nand ADB staff to exchange ideas and incorporate these into the book\u2019s outline. As noted in para. \n1, the main purpose of this project is to assess Asia\u2019s development since the 1960s and outline \nkey challenges for the future. Fifty years is a long enough period to assess the region at large \nand make a balanced and systemic assessment of what has really happened in Asia in terms of \ndevelopment, and why. \n \n13.  The book will have two main sections. The first will look at Asia\u2019s development since the \nmid-1960s and address two topics: (i) how views regarding Asia\u2019s development prospects have \nevolved over each decade following the founding of ADB, and (ii) how Asia\u2019s development has \ninfluenced and shaped development thought. This analysis will provide the overall framework to \ndiscuss  specific  topics  (e.g.,  agriculture,  industrialization,  the  export-led  growth  model, \ninequalities,  environmental  degradation,  and  infrastructure),  as  well  as  the  historical \ndevelopment of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). \n \n14.  The second part of the book will outline and discuss key challenges regarding the \nregion\u2019s future over the next decades (through 2050). The situation today is very different from \nthat in the 1970s and 1980s, when a number of Asian economies achieved very high growth \nrates.  As  observed  in  para.  10,  labor-saving  technological  progress  is  now  making \nindustrialization very difficult, and the possibility exists that many Asian countries may transition \ndirectly  from  agriculture  into  low-productivity  services,  without  experiencing  large-scale \nindustrialization. It is also possible that some of the new technologies developed (e.g., in the \narea of energy) favor Asian developing countries, and these thrive as a result. This could stem \nfrom significant changes in the types of products and services produced and/or demanded as a \nconsequence of increasing awareness of the high carbon footprint of many industries (and \npossibly  restrictions  placed  on  carbon  emissions  to  avoid  the  negative  effects  of  climate \nchange). The second part of the study will then explore the implications of these development \nmodels for wages, employment, and income distribution, and address issues such as: (i) options \nfor the less-developed countries of the region, (ii) the proportion of Asia\u2019s available labor that will \nfind productive work, (iii) whether new activities being developed will provide such work, and (iv) \nwhether middle-income countries are progressing to high-income status. It is important to note \nthat ADB has published several studies addressing these issues. 10 While the proposed and \nprevious studies will overlap in some areas, this study will have a greater focus on the past 50 \nyears. \n \n15.  Reputed scholars, policy makers, and development practitioners will be identified to \ncontribute to the book output. They will be invited to a high-level conference to discuss Asia\u2019s \ndevelopment record since the mid-1960s and assess the challenges ahead. The conference will \nbe held in Manila in mid-2015. The framework and chapters to be included in the book will be \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Manila.

ERD will hold regular roundtables with relevant departments to update, discuss progress \nwith, and get feedback from relevant departments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency and the Office of the Chief Economist, ERD, will be \nthe focal point. The TA is expected to start on 20 December 2014 and will be completed by 31 \nJuly 2017. \n \n20.  The  TA  will  require  10  international  consultants  with  expertise  on  development, \nspecifically in Asia, who will be invited to participate in the high-level conference in Manila in \nmid-2015 to brainstorm on the book. The other two international consultants will be engaged as \neditors  of  the  book.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  to  participate  in  the  high-level \nconference to share their knowledge on Asia\u2019s development. Finally, two national consultants \nwill be hired to provide technical and statistical support in the preparation of the book. The terms \nof  reference for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Lump-sum  engagement  will  be  applied  to \ninternational consultants. For national consultants, the time-based engagement will be used. \nThe consultants and resource persons will be engaged as individuals by ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) \n \n21.  The book will be launched at the 2017 Annual Meeting and will be disseminated to other \ndevelopment institutions, think tanks, and relevant policy makers in DMCs. \n \n22.  Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.
