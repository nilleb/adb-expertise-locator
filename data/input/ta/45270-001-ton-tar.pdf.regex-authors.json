INTRODUCTION \n1.  The focus of the technical assistance (TA) project is to support the Government of \nTonga\u2019s  efforts  to  sustain  the  momentum  of  its  economic  management  reforms.  This  is \nconsistent with the aims of the Tonga Strategic Development Plan (TSDP)1 and the Pacific \nApproach 2010\u20132014 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).2 The TA builds on achievements \nunder ADB\u2019s TA for Support for Economic and Strategic Management, which is scheduled for \ncompletion on 31 December 2011.3 \n \n2.  A  TA  fact  finding  mission  visited  Tonga  on  22\u201326  August  2011  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the government and other stakeholders on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  Tongan  economy  contracted  by  1.4%  in  FY2010  owing  to  domestic  banking \nconsolidation, weak export and tourism receipts due to the global economic crisis, and slow \nrecovery in major remittance source economies such as the United States and New Zealand. \nRemittances, typically equivalent to 30% of gross domestic product (GDP), fell to 22% of GDP \nin FY2010 and are unlikely to return to pre-FY2009 levels in the medium term. GDP growth is \nestimated to rebound to 1.4% in FY2011 on the back of stronger tourism activity and an \nexpansionary fiscal policy financed by development partner funds and previously contracted \nloans. However, risks to this outlook include rising inflation, weak global demand, and Tonga\u2019s \nhigh public debt. The International Monetary Fund expects growth to remain at about 1.7% over \nthe medium term\u2014in line with the average of the past 15 years, but slightly above the average \nof the past 10 years. This medium-term outlook, however, assumes implementation of the \ngovernment\u2019s plans, including increased donor-financed capital spending, structural reform, and \nimproved fiscal management to support fiscal consolidation.5 \n \n4.  According  to  the  2010  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA) \nassessment, the Tongan public financial management system is, overall, operating at average \nor above average levels when compared to international best practice.6 However, some areas \nare worthy of continued attention, especially in light of the difficult fiscal situation that the \ngovernment faces over the medium term. Tonga, already at high risk of debt distress, requires \nongoing  budget  support  grants  to  fund  its  development  priorities,  while  at  the  same  time \nachieving fiscal consolidation through lower fiscal deficits and no additional borrowing. The \nareas requiring continued attention include maintaining budget credibility, the need to embed \nmulti-year perspectives in budgeting, and presenting the budgetary impacts of policy changes (a \nsymptom of weak links between the corporate planning and annual budget process).  \n \n5.  ADB approved a $500,000 TA for Support for Economic and Strategic Management in \nDecember 2009, funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to help the government \nachieve (i) regular monitoring and reporting on progress made by the TSDP, (ii) use of a GDP \n                                                 \n1  Government of Tonga. 2010.

A subsequent change in scope dropped work on the GDP and revenue forecasting \nmodel, to direct additional resources to the MTBF. This reflected government commitment to \nbring forward the establishment of the MTBF through the preparation of an in-depth scoping \nreport. All outputs have been fully achieved. The report contains 48 detailed recommendations \nthat have been endorsed by the government and which will assist it to develop a framework for \nimplementing a sustainable medium-term budgeting system over the two year period of the TA \n(2012 and 2013).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The intended impact of the TA is enhanced resource allocation to foster economic \ngrowth  and  achieve  national  development  priorities.  The  impact  will  be  monitored  through \ndemonstrated improvements in country performance assessment ratings in macroeconomic \nmanagement,  and  the  quality  of  budgetary  and  financial  management.  The  expected  TA \noutcome will be the adoption by the government of improved economic management processes \nand practices. The achievement of this outcome will be reflected in improvements in PEFA \nratings.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support the strengthening of Tonga\u2019s GDP and revenue forecasting model, \nand ongoing development and implementation of the MTBF. The MBTF is envisaged to take a \nminimum of two budget cycles, and will require extensive work with line ministries, as well as \noutreach with parliamentarians, nongovernment organizations (NGO), and the general public. \nWork with the line ministries will involve developing a sector-based approach to budget planning, \nas  well  as  methods  of  intersectoral  prioritization.  Outreach  will  be  focused  on  creating \nawareness about, and building demand for, medium-term budgeting reforms. \n \n9.  Strengthening the forecasting model and implementation of the MTBF, will support the \ngovernment in addressing the weaknesses identified in the 2010 PEFA. This will improve the \noverall quality of public financial management and reduce the significant financial pressure that \nthe government is under. Discussions are also underway with the Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre to leverage their comparative advantage in the area of economic modeling. \nTo strengthen the analytical base for the reforms and to raise policy awareness, the TA will fund \nshort-term,  ad  hoc,  issues  papers  on  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policy,  public  financial \nmanagement,  and  corporate  planning.  Of  particular  importance  is  the  need  to  prepare  an \noverarching public financial management reform plan that links all ongoing efforts in this space. \nThe Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) can draw on this expertise as needs \nemerge during TA implementation. \n \n10.  The following outputs and activities are envisaged:  \n(i)  an MTBF that is strategically aligned: \n(a) developing  a  sequenced  and  prioritized  implementation  plan  for  the  scoping \nreport recommendations;  \n ", "  3\n(b) developing comprehensive and accurate multiyear costings of the TSDP, or any \nfuture decisions by the cabinet;  \n(c) improving  development  partner  reporting  mechanisms  to  ensure  the \ngovernment\u2019s  medium-term  budget  is  inclusive  of  monies  from  all  sources, \nincluding in-kind assistance;  \n(d) identifying and enumerating updated fiscal targets for Tonga, which will underpin \nthe country\u2019s medium-term budget for future years; and  \n(e) preparing ad hoc discussion papers on macroeconomic and fiscal policy, public \nfinancial management, and corporate planning to guide TA implementation.  \n(ii) an MTBF that is used by the whole of government:  \n(a) conducting relevant training and capacity building in medium-term budgeting, \nincluding preparation of manuals and guidelines for the MFNP and line ministries;  \n(b) conducting outreach to parliamentarians, NGO, and the general public; and  \n(c) implementing a policy of movement of staff between the MFNP work groups, that \nis, budget, policy and planning, and project and aid management to build skills \nand experience across different functional areas.  \n(iii) strengthened GDP and revenue forecasting:  \n(a) evaluating and customizing a GDP and revenue forecasting model for Tonga;  \n(b) establishing the model in policy and planning; and  \n(c) conducting relevant training and capacity building in use of the model, including \npreparation of manuals and guidelines. \n \n11.  The TA faces several risks, including lack of public awareness of the extent of Tonga\u2019s \nfiscal difficulties, ongoing financial difficulties (which might strain budget allocation and prompt \nad  hoc  changes  in  policy  focus),  and  turnover  of  key  staff  in  the  MFNP.  However,  the \ngovernment, and members of Parliament, are aware of the critical need to strengthen budget \nmanagement (the fiscal difficulties are well publicized) and remain fully committed to these \nreforms. ADB will continue to engage a wide range of stakeholders in programming discussions \nand TA management to ensure that a minimum level of awareness is maintained, and allow for \ncontinued support during implementation. \n \n12.  There is a need for continuing coordination\u2014through regular dialogue and information \nsharing\u2014with other key development partners, and with ADB's regional TA for Pacific Economic \nManagement.7 ADB\u2019s joint country focal office with the World Bank Group in Tonga will continue \nto strengthen collaboration between ADB and the World Bank, and with other development \npartners with an on-the-ground presence. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The government has requested ADB to finance $675,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, office supplies, and secretarial assistance. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Economic Management.

The MFNP will be the executing agency, while implementing agencies will include the \nBudget, and Policy and Planning divisions of the MFNP. The MFNP will use a TA steering \ncommittee  mechanism  (chaired  by  the  permanent  secretary,  and  comprising  the  heads  of \nBudget, Policy and Planning, and Project and Aid Management) to coordinate activities. Staff \nfrom the Budget Division and the TA consultants will serve as the committee\u2019s secretariat. The \nconsultants will also liaise with development partner programs and projects, so as to promote \ncoordination and complementarity.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months (9 January 2012\u201331 December 2013) and \nis expected to finance 20 person-months of full-time and intermittent international consulting, \nand 12 person-months of intermittent national consulting services. The consultants will work as \na cohesive team. The international consultant team will comprise a medium-term budgeting \nspecialist and team leader (8 person-months); an economic modeling specialist (3 person-\nmonths);  and  policy  advisors  (9  person-months).  They  will  be  joined  by  a  budget  advisor \n(national, 12 person-months). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n3. \n \n16.  The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis and according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The costs \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n17.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the TA, and a final report summarizing achievements, issues, lessons learned, \nand next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by e-mail) mission reports \nsummarizing the progress of TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. The team leader \nwill also prepare a mid-point report, which will be used as the basis for a midterm review of TA \nprogress. Team members will produce inputs (reports) on their activities for the team leader's \nprogress, mid-point, and final reports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft \nform at least 5 weeks prior to the end of the assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of \nreceipt of comments from the government and ADB. \n \n18.  The progress of the TA will be monitored using intended outcome and outputs described \nin the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. ADB will assist the government in \nsharing all reports with other development partners. This will be disseminated through round \ntable meetings, radio interviews, and through the ADB website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.
