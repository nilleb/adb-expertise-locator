THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  as  the  anchor  development  partner  of  the \nGovernment of Pakistan in the energy sector, leads development coordination and has provided \nassistance in energy generation, transmission, distribution, energy efficiency, renewable energy \ndevelopment,  hydrocarbons  (regional  gas  interconnection),  and  analytical  and  advisory \nassistance. The proposed transaction TA facility (F-TRTA) will provide preparation support to a \nseries of ensuing policy-based loans and investment lending projects, comprising (i) Energy \nSector Resilience Program (subprograms 1, 2, and 3 amounting to $1 billion); (ii) Hydropower \nDevelopment Project ($300 million); (iii) Power Transmission Strengthening Investment Program \nmultitranche  financing  facility  ($800  million);  (iv)  Second  Power  Distribution  Enhancement \nInvestment Program tranche 2 ($250 million) and (v) Gas Sector Development Project ($150 \nmillion). In addition, funds will be provisioned for capacity support on energy policy advice, scope \nand  sequencing  of  sector  reforms  and multiple  analytical  assessments  to  complement  the \nproposed projects.1 All ensuing energy projects require preparation, due diligence, design, and \nreadiness activities, which will be undertaken under this TA facility, thereby reducing transaction \ncosts. This F-TRTA is listed in the 2019 pipeline in the approved country operations and business \nplan (COBP), 2019\u20132021 for Pakistan. \n \n2.  After an improved economic growth during fiscal years (FY) 2013\u20132017, averaging 4.8%, \nthe  economic  growth  declined  to  2.8%  in  FY2018\u2013FY2019  underpinned  by  acute  energy \nshortages.2 Energy sector entities continue to rely on significant regular fiscal transfers and \nsovereign credit guarantees to maintain their operations and the power distribution companies \n(DISCOs) remain major recipient of such transfers accounting to nearly 1.5% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Further, Pakistan\u2019s power sector suffers from inefficiencies that cost the economy \n$18 billion or 6.5% of GDP.3 Shifting energy sector inefficiencies on businesses has undermined \ncountry\u2019s competitiveness, and the economy persistently suffers from energy shortages and from \nrelatively high tariffs. More than one-fourth of electricity generated is lost due to poor transmission \nand distribution infrastructure, theft, faulty metering, and inadequate energy accounting, thereby \nrendering the sector\u2019s capacity to address energy demand insufficient. On the other hand, the \npower demand has been growing by about 4% per year beginning 2015 and is estimated to \ncontinue to grow between 5%\u20136% per year until 2025.4 Therefore, going forward, Pakistan must \nadopt well-designed reforms to address the fundamental structural issues complemented by \ninvestments in energy infrastructure to address the technical, fiscal, institutional and governance \ndeficits that make country\u2019s energy sector financially unsustainable.5  \n \n3.  Following the general elections, the new government assumed office in September 2018. \nEnergy sector reforms and investments remain high on its development agenda as the high level \nof fiscal transfers to energy enterprises, including the emergence of circular debt, is undermining \n                                                \n1  The proposed F-TRTA and the ensuing projects are included in Pakistan\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan (2019\u2013\n2021). The amounts indicated in paragraph 1 are for ADB financing. Scope, nature, preparation timelines, and \nprojects may change as per discussion and agreement in the subsequent country operations and business plans. \nADB. 2018.

Lahore. 31 March. \n5  The circular debt as of 31 March 2019 stands at PKR1.45 trillion ($10 billion dollars) which is nearly 3% of GDP. \n \n ", "2   \nthe overall fiscal stability and growth, which is adversely affecting critical investments on social \nand economic infrastructure, especially when the government has very limited ability to fund such \ninvestment through borrowings. To this end, ADB-assisted consultants undertook a diagnostic \nstudy to identify sectoral inadequacies and challenges and recommended the way forward to \naddress these gaps through a series of sequenced reforms and coordinated investments as part \nof the energy policy and plan.6 After a consultative process of dialogue with relevant stakeholders, \nfederal and provincial, supported by analytical work, ADB\u2019s energy sector pipeline for the next 3 \nyears was developed and endorsed by the government. The proposed projects, included in the \nF-TRTA, fully align with sector priorities of (i) securing financial sustainability, (ii) strengthening \ninstitutional and regulatory governance, and (iii) reinforcing infrastructure and supply systems. \n \n4.  Energy sector reforms could save Pakistan\u2019s economy $8.4 billion in business losses and \ncould increase total household incomes by at least $4.5 billion per year.7 Reforms must therefore \ngo beyond liberalizing energy prices to address multiple aspects of sector distortions, including \nprioritizing gas allocation for efficient power generation and adopting tariff mechanisms that \nencourage performance, and rationalizing consumer prices that reflect supply costs and sector \narrears. The F-TRTA will support the preparation of a programmatic approach of policy-based \nlending, Energy Sector Resilience Program, addressing three sector priorities (para. 3).  \n \n5.  To regain sustainability in sector finances, however, the average generation tariff must be \nbrought down by optimizing generation mix and requires adding low cost indigenous generation \n(hydropower and renewable) into grids. Heavy reliance on imported furnace oil, re-gasified \nliquefied natural gas (RLNG) and, now, coal for power generation is also deepening the pressure \non foreign exchange reserves, widening the current account deficit, and depreciating the local \ncurrency. Therefore, the F-TRTA will support the preparation of hydropower development project, \nwhich will be supplemented with a separate project readiness financing facility to be processed in \n2020, to prepare a series of hydropower development projects on the Indus river cascade. \n \n6.  While nearly 10 gigawatts of new generation capacity has been added since 2013 to \nresolve the severe supply deficits, this generation capacity expansion has not corresponded to \nthe downstream investments, thereby placing additional stress on the existing transmission and \ndistribution  networks.  This  needs  urgent  attention  through  improved  system  expansion, \naugmentation, and maintenance. Old infrastructure and limited use of technology, coupled with \nexcess demand and utilization are increasing the loss levels due to tripping of transformers, \nfeeders, and (during the larger tripping incidents) even generation stations. The transmission \nnetwork at present carries 17,000 megawatt-peak of electricity only, with average transmission \nand distribution (technical and commercial) losses estimated at 2.6% and 18.5% respectively.8 In \nthe absence of a reliable network, the power generated cannot be transmitted, which the Central \nPower Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) has already termed as a capacity trap.9 The system \nupgrade  of the  National  Transmission  &  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  requires  a  $9  billion \ninvestment.10 Adding more capacity to match peak demand before strengthening downstream \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2017.

Therefore, F-\nTRTA will prepare ADB\u2019s third transmission strengthening program, and its first tranche will focus \non NTDC reforms as well as construction of high voltage direct current north-south power \ntransmission line to evacuate new generation from the coastal and southern power plants into the \ncentral and northern load centers of Pakistan. \n \n7.  The high network losses within the ten distribution companies (DISCOs) partly result due \nto the absence of any monitoring mechanism that track energy flow from the points of electricity \npurchases down to the final consumer. A reliable metering and recording system at multiple \nvoltage levels starting with the 132-kilovolt (kV) grid, then 11-kV, and to 400 volts (V) and 230 V \nis critical for the system. The system will not only eliminate the incidents of theft, but it can also \nprove to be the solution to unaccounted electricity and to diagnosing the technical problems, \nwhich have resulted in poor collection rates at the DISCOs. Installation of supervisory control and \ndata acquisition (SCADA), rolling out smart metering systems and aerial bundled conductors at \nthe DISCOs level will further strengthen the system to reduce losses and improve efficiency.  The \nF-TRTA would prepare the second tranche of the Second Power Distribution Enhancement \nInvestment Program which aims to strengthen system constraints and address leakages in two \nof the weakest and loss-making DISCOs in northern and southern Pakistan where average loss \nlevels of over 40%.11  \n \n8.  In addition to electricity, another priority energy subsector is natural gas. Natural gas \nmeets about 50% of Pakistan\u2019s primary energy needs, including as a fuel for power generation.12 \nOver the years, the performance and financial sustainability of the  subsector entities have \ndeteriorated and unaccounted gas losses range as high as 12%. Gas consumers in all categories \nare receiving inadequate supply, poor service, and are forced to use alternative fuels, which are \nmany times more expensive than domestic gas. Going forward, the government envisages gas \nsector reforms, with a view to bringing competition, increasing supply, and keeping the sector \nfinancially viable through higher wellhead prices in oil and gas exploration to make the country a \nviable investment destination, incentivizing  the private sector, diversifying existing hydrocarbon \nbase with newer, cheaper, and cleaner liquefied natural gas (LNG)\u2014mainly replacing residual \nfuel oil (RFO) in the power sector; undertaking investments in RLNG pipelines, terminals, and \nassociated gas storage infrastructure; and development of north\u2013south and regional trade gas \npipelines. The government has requested ADB\u2019s intervention in developing gas storage systems \nto optimize seasonal variations and imports pricing, as well as development of gas transmission \n(national and regional) pipelines. The F-TRTA will prepare a Gas Development Project to explore \ngas  storage  options  and  locations  across  Pakistan.  It  will  prepare  feasibility  studies  for \ninfrastructure to balance seasonal and shorter-term fluctuations of demand, reduce the costly \nupstream and imported flexibility needs (supply and transport), and bring efficiency in the LNG \nsupply chain to ensure continuity and safeguard from sudden import price spikes.  \n \n9.  The newly established Energy Sector Task Force of the Prime Minister has confirmed \nADB\u2019s energy program to be prepared under the F-TRTA. The five ensuing projects are well-\naligned with the current objectives of the Government of Pakistan as well as with ADB\u2019s Country \nPartnership Strategy for Pakistan. The preparation of these projects will draw upon the lessons \nand recommendations confirmed by recently concluded Sector Assistance Program Evaluation \n                                                \n11 Ministry of Energy has identified Peshawar Electricity Supply Company and Sukkur Electric Power Company for \ninclusion in the program.  \n12 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Energy, Hydrocarbon Development Institute of Pakistan. 2017.

These projects will improve \nthe quality of energy supply; improve efficiency in the transmission and distribution networks; and \nhelp build a sustainable, reliable, and viable energy sector in Pakistan. \n \n B.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Energy sector project feasibility and preparation supported. The F-TRTA \nfacility will provide technical expertise to prioritize, plan, and prepare investment projects for the \nproposed (i) Energy Sector Resilience Program (subprograms 1, 2, and 3 amounting to $1 \nbillion);14  (ii) Hydropower  Development  Project  ($300  million);  (iii)  Power  Transmission \nStrengthening  multitranche  financing  facility  ($800  million);  (iv)  Second  Power  Distribution \nEnhancement Investment Program tranche 2 ($250 million); and (v) Gas Sector Development \nProject ($150 million).15 This will include all requisite due diligence; assessment of technical \nsuitability; and the economic, financial, and social viability of proposed projects. The F-TRTA \nfacility  will  also  address  capacity  and  institutional  constraints,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards, and gender concerns, and identify measures to strengthen project implementation \nand policy related issues. Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) technical feasibility \nstudies;  (ii)  economic  and  financial  analysis;  (iii) financial  management  assessment; \n(iv) procurement assessment, plan, and preparation of bidding documents; (v) poverty, social, \nand  gender  assessment;  (vi)  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan;  (vii) safeguards \ndocuments on environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; (viii) integrity due \ndiligence;  (ix)  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis;  (x)  environmental  flow  assessment  for \nhydropower projects, (xi) climate change adaptation measures, and climate risk and vulnerability \nassessment; (xii) sector assessment; (xiii) project implementation consultants recruitment; (xiv) \nassisting resettlement plan implementation; and (xv) analytical work related to power and gas \nsector reforms, among others. All outputs will be delivered and disseminated through digital \npublications.  \n11.  Output 2: Project management capacity of the executing agency improved. Some \nprojects will be implemented by new agencies and project management units, which will require \nstart-up capacity support. The F-TRTA will also assist the government to assess its investment \npipeline, prioritize and sequence energy projects, and optimize financial and capital structure \nincluding private sector participation in the investment. \n \n12.  The F-TRTA is considered complex because (i) ADB has no experience with one of the \nexecuting agencies, (ii) safeguards classifications for the ensuing hydropower project would be \nA, and (iii) high-level technology could apply.  \n \n                                                \n13 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Multiple donors have expressed \ninterest to cofinance subprograms 2 and 3.   \n15  The approved COBP 2019\u20132021 for Pakistan listed Gas Transmission Project for approval in 2021. However, during \nthe ongoing country programming mission (22 February\u201314 March 2019), the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) \nhas requested for financing of a gas storage infrastructure project for approval in 2020. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The F-TRTA is estimated to cost $2,750,000, of which $2,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n  \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office \naccommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions, with an estimated value of \napproximately 9% of the total cost of the TA facility. The government was informed that approval \nof the F-TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The F-TRTA activities for ensuing projects will start only after ADB approves the project \nconcept paper for each of the ensuing project. ADB will administer the F-TRTA facility and will be \nresponsible for the selection, supervision, and evaluation of consultants under the F-TRTA. The \nexecuting agencies are the Ministry of Finance for the policy-based lending; the Ministry of Energy \nfor the transmission, distribution, and gas development investment projects; and the Ministry of \nWater Resources for the hydropower project. The implementing agencies will be the Water and \nPower Development Authority for the hydropower project, the NTDC for the power transmission \nproject, the Interstate Gas Systems Limited for gas development, and the concerned power \nDISCOs for the power distribution enhancement projects. The Energy Sector Task Force of the \nPrime Minister will oversee and monitor projects preparatory activities under the F-TRTA. \n   \n16.
