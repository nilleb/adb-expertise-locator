The Twenty-Year Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) of His Majesty's\nGovernment of Nepal, prepared with Bank assistance, recommended technical assistance (TA)\nto support the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in producing the information necessary for\nplanning and monitoring agriculture projects. During the Bank's 1995 Country Programming\nMission, the Government requested the Bank to provide TA to support the development of\nagriculture statistics in the country. A Fact-finding Mission in February 1997 discussed and\nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, and implementation\n1\nof the TA. \nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In 1993, responsibility for collecting and generating statistics in agriculture was\nformally transferred to CBS from the Department of Food and Marketing Services (DFAMS).\nCharge of the 35 district offices that oversee agriculture data collection from the 75 districts of\nNepal was given to CBS. However, aside from a few senior officers who are currently assigned\nto the CBS head office, only the middle and the lowest level personnel were moved to CBS.\nAlso, very little field and office equipment was actually transferred to CBS.\n3. Since the transfer, CBS has managed to conduct only two agricultural crops\nsurveys, one pilot livestock survey, and three annual surveys of fishpond owners. Furthermore,\nbecause of technical deficiencies in the survey design and estimation procedure used;\ninadequate enumerator skills; less than accurate method of measuring crop areas, yield, and\nproduction; and lack of field supervisors and systematic validation of data at the district and\nhead office levels, the results of the two agricultural crops surveys were found to be not very\nreliable. The pilot livestock survey results suffered a similar fate. The training of district office\nstaff in agriculture survey operations has also proceeded very slowly. These factors led to\ngrowing concerns among the Government and multilateral agencies about CBS' capability to fill\nimportant data gaps and to improve the reliability, timeliness, and relevance of available\nagriculture statistics.\n4. The current organization structure of CBS includes three sections dealing with\nagriculture statistics: crop survey, livestock and fisheries, and agriculture census (see Appendix\n1). While some of the staff in these sections had been trained by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization advisers who were in residence during the 1991 Agriculture Census, most of the\ndistrict office staff who are involved in actual data collection have received very little training\nand guidance from the head office. The full-time enumerators of one district visited by the\nFact-finding Mission were found insufficiently informed about standard field practices\nconcerning data collection, such as rules on replacement of sampling units and random checks\nin the field by supervisors. As of February 1997, of the 612 personnel of CBS occupying\ntechnical positions, only 29 at the officer level and four non-officer level assistants had been\ntrained in CBS1 technical procedures. There is a dearth of written guidelines such as\nenumerators' and field supervisors' manuals.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1996.", "2\n5. Because CBS estimates could not be generated in time for the fiscal year's\nplanning and budget preparation, the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Ministry of\nAgriculture (MOA) continue to rely solely on the data being subjectively gathered by the latter's\nextension workers. The generation of summary tables on production and area planted, for\nexample, always took longer than expected at CBS because all the data processing was\ncentralized at the head office on account of inadequate infrastructure at the district level.\n6. The most recent CBS publication on agriculture statistics contains only estimates\nof yield, production and area of major crops by district level. Important data gaps will become\nmore apparent in the next few years when major projects of the APP come on stream. For\nexample, the APP calls for the rapid expansion of groundwater irrigation development mainly in\nthe lowland region. To measure the impact of this irrigation project, there is a need for\nseparate estimates for irrigated and non-irrigated crop areas. The same can be said for the\nimpact of the increased availability of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and the shift to high-\nvalue crops.\n7. The Government is aware of these weaknesses in Nepal's agriculture database.\nInconsistencies of CBS' estimates with those from other sources, such as the Land Resource\nMapping Project and MOA, were investigated in a study commissioned by NPC and noted in\nthe APP Report. Questions regarding structural inconsistencies of CBS' estimates were also\nraised by the APP. The Government responded by substantially increasing the budget of CBS\nin 1994, which, however, went mostly to salaries and wages of district office staff who were\ntransferred from DFAMS to CBS. Resources for statistics manpower training and data\ncollection and data processing, to name some essential activities of a central statistical office,\nhave not increased correspondingly.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8.\t The TA will assist the Government in upgrading the institutional and technical\ncapacity of CBS in the field of agriculture statistics. The specific objectives are to\n(i) assist CBS in institutionalizing a system of agriculture surveys that will\nrender reliable, timely, and relevant statistics as well as minimize data gaps;\n(ii) enhance the administrative and technical capability of CBS through\npersonnel training; and\n(iii) help implement a partially decentralized and more efficient data processing\nsystem through the provision of consulting services and some computing\nequipment.\nB.\t Scope\n9. To help institutionalize a system of agriculture surveys, the TA will support the\nfollowing activities: (I) conduct of two agriculture crops/backyard livestock surveys, one of which\nwill be scheduled after the harvest of summer crops in 1997, and the other after the harvest of\nwinter crops in 1998; (ii) on-the-job training of selected CBS staff in the design of sample\nsurveys and questionnaires; in the development of sample surveys, field operations, and data\nprocessing manuals; and in establishing data processing procedures and guidelines; (iii)", "3\nconduct of special surveys and studies to improve the methodology for collecting agriculture\ndata; (iv) training of CBS head office and district office staff in sample surveys, field operations,\nand data processing; and (v) apprenticeship of two or three CBS staff in another country's\nagriculture statistics office. The training activities, conduct of special surveys and studies, and\napprenticeship program are also envisioned to help improve the technical and administrative\ncapabilities of CBS personnel.\n10. To facilitate the timely compilation of agriculture statistics, the TA will assist in\nestablishing a partly decentralized data processing system at CBS. The TA will provide some\ndistrict offices with computer equipment and sufficient training to enable them to do the data\nentry of the agricultural crops/livestock survey questionnaires and generate basic summary\ntables. These district offices will be selected on the basis of their volume of data processing\nand aptitude of their staff in the use of computer software and hardware. Motorcycles will also\nbe procured to assist supervisors in checking enumerators during field work and in performing\nother data collection activities. Calculators will be provided for the use of enumerators and\nsupervisors in validating questionnaires.\n11. The TA will provide CBS with two categories or groups of advisers. One group\nwill consist of two consultants on agriculture sample survey design, methodology, and\noperations who will be engaged for a short term (a total of three person-months). Their main\ntask is to provide recommendations on how to plan, design, implement, and analyze the\nsurveys. Another group of two consultants (junior level from other Developing Member\nCountries [DMCsJ) will be engaged for longer periods (a total of 20 person-months), with\nprincipal responsibility for helping CBS staff implement the recommendations of the first group\nof consultants. Their expertise will cover survey instrument preparation (questionnaires,\nmanuals, and training materials); field operations; and computerized data processing. A\ndomestic consultant will also be engaged to provide support to the the second group of\nconsultants.\n12. The consultants will also assist in identifying, planning, and implementing special\nstudies needed to improve methods of agriculture data collection; in processing of existing\nadministrative data into useful statistics and indicators; and in filling critical data gaps. A prime\nexample of such a special study is the use of a subsample from the above-mentioned surveys\nto perform field experiments comparing the quality of data obtained from different methods of\nmeasurement, e.g., land area measurement and crop cutting versus face-to-face interview in\nestimating crop area and yield, respectively.\n13. In addition to imparting on-the-job training to their local counterparts, the\nconsultants will also assist in developing and conducting short-term in-country training courses\nfor CBS staff in the districts. The topics covered will include interviewing and field supervision\ntechniques, data processing and limited computer networking activities. Detailed terms of\nreferences and qualifications of the consultants and experts are given in Appendix 2.\n14. An apprenticeship program will be arranged with a host country whose\nagriculture statistics infrastructure is more advanced than CBS but whose organizational setup\nand agriculture sector bear some similarities with Nepal's. Two or three CBS staff will work in\nthe host country's institution for agriculture statistics for a period of two months to get on-the-\njob training in compiling and estimating agriculture statistics. After they return to CBS, the\napprentices will spearhead further training in agriculture statistics survey methodology of other", "4\nCBS staff and will be responsible for improving the system of agriculture surveys that the TA\nwill help establish.\n15. After the first year of the TA's implementation, CBS should be able to produce\nreliable and statistically sound agriculture estimates at the national level for the Government's\nbudget and planning purposes. These estimates could be used to evaluate and fine-tune the\ndata that MOA produces at the district level. The establishment of a partly decentralized\nsystem will decongest the data processing at the CBS head office and will permit timely\nstatistics at the completion of the TA. Also, the training (formal and on-the-job) and\napprenticeship programs will produce capable and well-versed CBS staff who should be able to\nmanage and improve the system of agriculture surveys that the TA has started.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $465,000 equivalent, comprising\n$360,000 in foreign exchange cost and $105,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Bank\nwill finance on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan, the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to\n$40,000 equivalent (see Appendix 3). The Government will provide the remaining portion of\nthe local currency cost, equivalent to $65,000, representing the cost of conducting the sample\nsurveys including the printing of questionnaires and manuals, and in kind contributions such as\ncounterpart staff salaries, use of office facilities, and other administrative overhead.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. Implementation of the TA, which is anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter\nof 1997, will be spread over 24 months and completed in the third quarter of 1999 (see\nAppendix 4). CBS will be the Executing Agency. Aside from administrative functions, CBS will\n(i) translate the data processing and field operations (enumerators' and supervisors') manuals\ninto Nepali; (ii) provide counterparts to the consultants; and (iii) render administrative and\ntechnical support to the consultants. A liaison officer for the TA will be appointed by CBS to\noversee TA activities and facilitate coordination between CBS and the Bank.\n18. Monitoring and review of the TA will be done through Bank missions and the\ncompletion reports of consultants. Moreover, CBS will submit an assessment report and\nrecommendations for furture action after completion of each major activity: (i) the summer and\nwinter agriculture crops surveys; (ii) training of enumerators and supervisors; (iii) training of\ndata processing staff; and (iv) apprenticeships. Likewise, CBS will submit to the Bank a\ncompletion-cum-evaluation report within three months from completion of the TA.\n19. The first group of consultants will be individuals with extensive technical\nbackground and experience in the administration of a national agriculture statistics office\n(NASO), and in planning and conducting agriculture sample surveys. Heads or senior technical\npersonnel of a NASO in a Bank DMC would be ideal candidates. On the other hand, the\nsecond group of consultants (junior level from other DMCs) will be middle or upper-middle\nechelon staff of a NASO who have had long experience in the field supervision, questionnaire\ndesign and processing of large-scale agriculture sample surveys. The international and\ndomestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of", "5\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.\n20. The purchase of computers, vehicles and other durable equipment from TA\nproceeds will be done in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The\nequipment will be turned over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA. Payments\nrelated to training, the apprenticeship program, and special studies and surveys will be coursed\nthrough the Bank's Nepal Resident Mission.\n21. The choice of the trainees for the apprenticeship program will be on a merit basis\nand must be approved by the Bank. The trainees will be recommended by CBS' top\nmanagement in consultation with the TA consultants. The Government will be enjoined to take\nthe necessary steps to ensure that the staff members who are awarded apprenticeships will\nreturn and continue working for CBS for at least three years.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majestys Government of Nepal in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 for the purpose of Supporting Agriculture\nStatistics Development, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTHE STATISTICAL SYSTEM IN NEPAL\n1. The Central Bureau of Statistics in Nepal (CBS) has 660 staff, 612 of whom are\ntechnical personnel. Of the 660, 494 are assigned to the 33 district offices of CBS. Each\ndistrict office is managed by a third class gazetted officer. There are 29 staff at the officer level\nwho have been trained in CBS technical procedures. Four non-officer level assistants were\nalso trained.\n2. CBS is headed by a Director-General (equivalent to an Undersecretary). There\nshould be two Deputy Director-General positions to supervise the social statistics and\neconomic statistics divisions. One Deputy Director-General however, was seconded to the\nNational Computing Centre; hence there is one Deputy Director-General to supervise both\ndivisions. The Director-General directly supervises the district offices and the administrative;\nfinance; and standardization, coordination, and planning sections. The organization chart of\nCBS is included in this Appendix.\n3. CBS compiles social and environmental statistics and supports the Ministry of\nFinance in generating national accounts. Last year, CBS started to publish major crop\nproduction, livestock, and fisheries statistics. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) generates the\nprice indexes from its regular Household Expenditure surveys. This survey started with CBS\nbut was transferred to NRB to streamline data processing procedures. NRB also compiles\nmost of the other official statistics - money and banking, balance of payments, and production\nindexes.\n4. Various international agencies have sponsored some of CBS' activities in this\ndecade. The United Nations Population Fund supported the 1991 Population Census; the\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the 1991 Census of Agriculture; the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the Strengthening Socioeconomic Statistics and National Accounts\nproject (1991-1992); and World Bank, the Living Standards Survey (1994-1996). While CBS\nhas not conducted a nationwide survey on its own, because of interactions with consultants\nfrom these international agencies, some expertise in sample survey design, implementation,\nand processing exists. However, this expertise remains within the sections that acted as\ncounterparts to the abovementioned activities. For example, because of the World Bank's\nLiving Standard Survey, the Household Survey Section is more advanced in data processing\ntechniques than the Data Processing Section.\n5. CBS has the following computer equipment: 2 pentiums with 16 megabytes (MB)\nof Random Access Memory (RAM); 10 PC 486s with 8-16 MB RAM; 5 PC 386s, with 4 MB\nRAM; 10 PC 286s and 3 Laserjet printers. Only 3 PC 386s and 4 PC 286s are with the\nagriculture sections, however. There are also five dot matrix printers in good working condition.\nMost of the computers have either Windows 3.11 or Windows 95 software. The Data\nProcessing Section uses either SPSS or STATS software for cross tabulation and other\nanalytical purposes. Some of the staff who trained in Integrated Microcomputer Processing\nSystem left CBS for more lucrative employment.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 4)", "NEPAL'S CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS\nNatIcna PIrTYng ComnissioC\nSesretariat\nNatcna) Statistical\nCouncil\nDIRECTOR GENERAL\nSOCIAL STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION\t FINaiJCAL\t STANDARDIZATION\t 3 FIELD ECONOMIC STATISTICS DIVISION\nDIVISION STATISTICS\n(DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL) SECTION\t ADMNISTRATION\t COORDINATION AND\t OFFICES (DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL)\nSECTION\t PLANNING SECTION\nPOPULATION\t HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS NATIONAL INCOME AGRICULTURE\nCENSUS\t SECflON AND OTHER ECONDM CENSUS SECTION\nSECTION ACCOUNTS SECTION\nSOCIAL\t TRAINING SECTION ESTAbLISHMENT CROP SURVEY\nS tAT IS T IC S CENSUS AND SECTION\nSECTION SURVEY SECTION\nDATA PROCESSING\t PUbLICATION AND PRICE AND INDEX LIVESTOCE AND\nSECTION\t CARTOGRAPHY SECTON FISHERIES\nSECTION SURVEY SECTION\n\"S", "8\nAppendix 2, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\nA.\t Sample Survey Design Consultant (1 person-month)\n1.

The Twenty-Year Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) of His Majesty's\nGovernment of Nepal, prepared with Bank assistance, recommended technical assistance (TA)\nto support the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in producing the information necessary for\nplanning and monitoring agriculture projects. During the Bank's 1995 Country Programming\nMission, the Government requested the Bank to provide TA to support the development of\nagriculture statistics in the country. A Fact-finding Mission in February 1997 discussed and\nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, and implementation\n1\nof the TA. \nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In 1993, responsibility for collecting and generating statistics in agriculture was\nformally transferred to CBS from the Department of Food and Marketing Services (DFAMS).\nCharge of the 35 district offices that oversee agriculture data collection from the 75 districts of\nNepal was given to CBS. However, aside from a few senior officers who are currently assigned\nto the CBS head office, only the middle and the lowest level personnel were moved to CBS.\nAlso, very little field and office equipment was actually transferred to CBS.\n3. Since the transfer, CBS has managed to conduct only two agricultural crops\nsurveys, one pilot livestock survey, and three annual surveys of fishpond owners. Furthermore,\nbecause of technical deficiencies in the survey design and estimation procedure used;\ninadequate enumerator skills; less than accurate method of measuring crop areas, yield, and\nproduction; and lack of field supervisors and systematic validation of data at the district and\nhead office levels, the results of the two agricultural crops surveys were found to be not very\nreliable. The pilot livestock survey results suffered a similar fate. The training of district office\nstaff in agriculture survey operations has also proceeded very slowly. These factors led to\ngrowing concerns among the Government and multilateral agencies about CBS' capability to fill\nimportant data gaps and to improve the reliability, timeliness, and relevance of available\nagriculture statistics.\n4. The current organization structure of CBS includes three sections dealing with\nagriculture statistics: crop survey, livestock and fisheries, and agriculture census (see Appendix\n1). While some of the staff in these sections had been trained by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization advisers who were in residence during the 1991 Agriculture Census, most of the\ndistrict office staff who are involved in actual data collection have received very little training\nand guidance from the head office. The full-time enumerators of one district visited by the\nFact-finding Mission were found insufficiently informed about standard field practices\nconcerning data collection, such as rules on replacement of sampling units and random checks\nin the field by supervisors. As of February 1997, of the 612 personnel of CBS occupying\ntechnical positions, only 29 at the officer level and four non-officer level assistants had been\ntrained in CBS1 technical procedures. There is a dearth of written guidelines such as\nenumerators' and field supervisors' manuals.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in December 1996.", "2\n5. Because CBS estimates could not be generated in time for the fiscal year's\nplanning and budget preparation, the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Ministry of\nAgriculture (MOA) continue to rely solely on the data being subjectively gathered by the latter's\nextension workers. The generation of summary tables on production and area planted, for\nexample, always took longer than expected at CBS because all the data processing was\ncentralized at the head office on account of inadequate infrastructure at the district level.\n6. The most recent CBS publication on agriculture statistics contains only estimates\nof yield, production and area of major crops by district level. Important data gaps will become\nmore apparent in the next few years when major projects of the APP come on stream. For\nexample, the APP calls for the rapid expansion of groundwater irrigation development mainly in\nthe lowland region. To measure the impact of this irrigation project, there is a need for\nseparate estimates for irrigated and non-irrigated crop areas. The same can be said for the\nimpact of the increased availability of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs and the shift to high-\nvalue crops.\n7. The Government is aware of these weaknesses in Nepal's agriculture database.\nInconsistencies of CBS' estimates with those from other sources, such as the Land Resource\nMapping Project and MOA, were investigated in a study commissioned by NPC and noted in\nthe APP Report. Questions regarding structural inconsistencies of CBS' estimates were also\nraised by the APP. The Government responded by substantially increasing the budget of CBS\nin 1994, which, however, went mostly to salaries and wages of district office staff who were\ntransferred from DFAMS to CBS. Resources for statistics manpower training and data\ncollection and data processing, to name some essential activities of a central statistical office,\nhave not increased correspondingly.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8.\t The TA will assist the Government in upgrading the institutional and technical\ncapacity of CBS in the field of agriculture statistics. The specific objectives are to\n(i) assist CBS in institutionalizing a system of agriculture surveys that will\nrender reliable, timely, and relevant statistics as well as minimize data gaps;\n(ii) enhance the administrative and technical capability of CBS through\npersonnel training; and\n(iii) help implement a partially decentralized and more efficient data processing\nsystem through the provision of consulting services and some computing\nequipment.\nB.\t Scope\n9. To help institutionalize a system of agriculture surveys, the TA will support the\nfollowing activities: (I) conduct of two agriculture crops/backyard livestock surveys, one of which\nwill be scheduled after the harvest of summer crops in 1997, and the other after the harvest of\nwinter crops in 1998; (ii) on-the-job training of selected CBS staff in the design of sample\nsurveys and questionnaires; in the development of sample surveys, field operations, and data\nprocessing manuals; and in establishing data processing procedures and guidelines; (iii)", "3\nconduct of special surveys and studies to improve the methodology for collecting agriculture\ndata; (iv) training of CBS head office and district office staff in sample surveys, field operations,\nand data processing; and (v) apprenticeship of two or three CBS staff in another country's\nagriculture statistics office. The training activities, conduct of special surveys and studies, and\napprenticeship program are also envisioned to help improve the technical and administrative\ncapabilities of CBS personnel.\n10. To facilitate the timely compilation of agriculture statistics, the TA will assist in\nestablishing a partly decentralized data processing system at CBS. The TA will provide some\ndistrict offices with computer equipment and sufficient training to enable them to do the data\nentry of the agricultural crops/livestock survey questionnaires and generate basic summary\ntables. These district offices will be selected on the basis of their volume of data processing\nand aptitude of their staff in the use of computer software and hardware. Motorcycles will also\nbe procured to assist supervisors in checking enumerators during field work and in performing\nother data collection activities. Calculators will be provided for the use of enumerators and\nsupervisors in validating questionnaires.\n11. The TA will provide CBS with two categories or groups of advisers. One group\nwill consist of two consultants on agriculture sample survey design, methodology, and\noperations who will be engaged for a short term (a total of three person-months). Their main\ntask is to provide recommendations on how to plan, design, implement, and analyze the\nsurveys. Another group of two consultants (junior level from other Developing Member\nCountries [DMCsJ) will be engaged for longer periods (a total of 20 person-months), with\nprincipal responsibility for helping CBS staff implement the recommendations of the first group\nof consultants. Their expertise will cover survey instrument preparation (questionnaires,\nmanuals, and training materials); field operations; and computerized data processing. A\ndomestic consultant will also be engaged to provide support to the the second group of\nconsultants.\n12. The consultants will also assist in identifying, planning, and implementing special\nstudies needed to improve methods of agriculture data collection; in processing of existing\nadministrative data into useful statistics and indicators; and in filling critical data gaps. A prime\nexample of such a special study is the use of a subsample from the above-mentioned surveys\nto perform field experiments comparing the quality of data obtained from different methods of\nmeasurement, e.g., land area measurement and crop cutting versus face-to-face interview in\nestimating crop area and yield, respectively.\n13. In addition to imparting on-the-job training to their local counterparts, the\nconsultants will also assist in developing and conducting short-term in-country training courses\nfor CBS staff in the districts. The topics covered will include interviewing and field supervision\ntechniques, data processing and limited computer networking activities. Detailed terms of\nreferences and qualifications of the consultants and experts are given in Appendix 2.\n14. An apprenticeship program will be arranged with a host country whose\nagriculture statistics infrastructure is more advanced than CBS but whose organizational setup\nand agriculture sector bear some similarities with Nepal's. Two or three CBS staff will work in\nthe host country's institution for agriculture statistics for a period of two months to get on-the-\njob training in compiling and estimating agriculture statistics. After they return to CBS, the\napprentices will spearhead further training in agriculture statistics survey methodology of other", "4\nCBS staff and will be responsible for improving the system of agriculture surveys that the TA\nwill help establish.\n15. After the first year of the TA's implementation, CBS should be able to produce\nreliable and statistically sound agriculture estimates at the national level for the Government's\nbudget and planning purposes. These estimates could be used to evaluate and fine-tune the\ndata that MOA produces at the district level. The establishment of a partly decentralized\nsystem will decongest the data processing at the CBS head office and will permit timely\nstatistics at the completion of the TA. Also, the training (formal and on-the-job) and\napprenticeship programs will produce capable and well-versed CBS staff who should be able to\nmanage and improve the system of agriculture surveys that the TA has started.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $465,000 equivalent, comprising\n$360,000 in foreign exchange cost and $105,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Bank\nwill finance on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan, the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost amounting to\n$40,000 equivalent (see Appendix 3). The Government will provide the remaining portion of\nthe local currency cost, equivalent to $65,000, representing the cost of conducting the sample\nsurveys including the printing of questionnaires and manuals, and in kind contributions such as\ncounterpart staff salaries, use of office facilities, and other administrative overhead.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. Implementation of the TA, which is anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter\nof 1997, will be spread over 24 months and completed in the third quarter of 1999 (see\nAppendix 4). CBS will be the Executing Agency. Aside from administrative functions, CBS will\n(i) translate the data processing and field operations (enumerators' and supervisors') manuals\ninto Nepali; (ii) provide counterparts to the consultants; and (iii) render administrative and\ntechnical support to the consultants. A liaison officer for the TA will be appointed by CBS to\noversee TA activities and facilitate coordination between CBS and the Bank.\n18. Monitoring and review of the TA will be done through Bank missions and the\ncompletion reports of consultants. Moreover, CBS will submit an assessment report and\nrecommendations for furture action after completion of each major activity: (i) the summer and\nwinter agriculture crops surveys; (ii) training of enumerators and supervisors; (iii) training of\ndata processing staff; and (iv) apprenticeships. Likewise, CBS will submit to the Bank a\ncompletion-cum-evaluation report within three months from completion of the TA.\n19. The first group of consultants will be individuals with extensive technical\nbackground and experience in the administration of a national agriculture statistics office\n(NASO), and in planning and conducting agriculture sample surveys. Heads or senior technical\npersonnel of a NASO in a Bank DMC would be ideal candidates. On the other hand, the\nsecond group of consultants (junior level from other DMCs) will be middle or upper-middle\nechelon staff of a NASO who have had long experience in the field supervision, questionnaire\ndesign and processing of large-scale agriculture sample surveys. The international and\ndomestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on the Use of", "5\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants.\n20. The purchase of computers, vehicles and other durable equipment from TA\nproceeds will be done in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The\nequipment will be turned over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA. Payments\nrelated to training, the apprenticeship program, and special studies and surveys will be coursed\nthrough the Bank's Nepal Resident Mission.\n21. The choice of the trainees for the apprenticeship program will be on a merit basis\nand must be approved by the Bank. The trainees will be recommended by CBS' top\nmanagement in consultation with the TA consultants. The Government will be enjoined to take\nthe necessary steps to ensure that the staff members who are awarded apprenticeships will\nreturn and continue working for CBS for at least three years.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majestys Government of Nepal in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 for the purpose of Supporting Agriculture\nStatistics Development, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTHE STATISTICAL SYSTEM IN NEPAL\n1. The Central Bureau of Statistics in Nepal (CBS) has 660 staff, 612 of whom are\ntechnical personnel. Of the 660, 494 are assigned to the 33 district offices of CBS. Each\ndistrict office is managed by a third class gazetted officer. There are 29 staff at the officer level\nwho have been trained in CBS technical procedures. Four non-officer level assistants were\nalso trained.\n2. CBS is headed by a Director-General (equivalent to an Undersecretary). There\nshould be two Deputy Director-General positions to supervise the social statistics and\neconomic statistics divisions. One Deputy Director-General however, was seconded to the\nNational Computing Centre; hence there is one Deputy Director-General to supervise both\ndivisions. The Director-General directly supervises the district offices and the administrative;\nfinance; and standardization, coordination, and planning sections. The organization chart of\nCBS is included in this Appendix.\n3. CBS compiles social and environmental statistics and supports the Ministry of\nFinance in generating national accounts. Last year, CBS started to publish major crop\nproduction, livestock, and fisheries statistics. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) generates the\nprice indexes from its regular Household Expenditure surveys. This survey started with CBS\nbut was transferred to NRB to streamline data processing procedures. NRB also compiles\nmost of the other official statistics - money and banking, balance of payments, and production\nindexes.\n4. Various international agencies have sponsored some of CBS' activities in this\ndecade. The United Nations Population Fund supported the 1991 Population Census; the\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the 1991 Census of Agriculture; the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, the Strengthening Socioeconomic Statistics and National Accounts\nproject (1991-1992); and World Bank, the Living Standards Survey (1994-1996). While CBS\nhas not conducted a nationwide survey on its own, because of interactions with consultants\nfrom these international agencies, some expertise in sample survey design, implementation,\nand processing exists. However, this expertise remains within the sections that acted as\ncounterparts to the abovementioned activities. For example, because of the World Bank's\nLiving Standard Survey, the Household Survey Section is more advanced in data processing\ntechniques than the Data Processing Section.\n5. CBS has the following computer equipment: 2 pentiums with 16 megabytes (MB)\nof Random Access Memory (RAM); 10 PC 486s with 8-16 MB RAM; 5 PC 386s, with 4 MB\nRAM; 10 PC 286s and 3 Laserjet printers. Only 3 PC 386s and 4 PC 286s are with the\nagriculture sections, however. There are also five dot matrix printers in good working condition.\nMost of the computers have either Windows 3.11 or Windows 95 software. The Data\nProcessing Section uses either SPSS or STATS software for cross tabulation and other\nanalytical purposes. Some of the staff who trained in Integrated Microcomputer Processing\nSystem left CBS for more lucrative employment.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 4)", "NEPAL'S CENTRAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS\nNatIcna PIrTYng ComnissioC\nSesretariat\nNatcna) Statistical\nCouncil\nDIRECTOR GENERAL\nSOCIAL STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION\t FINaiJCAL\t STANDARDIZATION\t 3 FIELD ECONOMIC STATISTICS DIVISION\nDIVISION STATISTICS\n(DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL) SECTION\t ADMNISTRATION\t COORDINATION AND\t OFFICES (DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL)\nSECTION\t PLANNING SECTION\nPOPULATION\t HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS NATIONAL INCOME AGRICULTURE\nCENSUS\t SECflON AND OTHER ECONDM CENSUS SECTION\nSECTION ACCOUNTS SECTION\nSOCIAL\t TRAINING SECTION ESTAbLISHMENT CROP SURVEY\nS tAT IS T IC S CENSUS AND SECTION\nSECTION SURVEY SECTION\nDATA PROCESSING\t PUbLICATION AND PRICE AND INDEX LIVESTOCE AND\nSECTION\t CARTOGRAPHY SECTON FISHERIES\nSECTION SURVEY SECTION\n\"S"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090421194208+08'00'", "Author": "Asian Development Bank", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "nep, nepal, agriculture, data collection, agriculture statistics, adb project 30229 ", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3190-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20101207115342+08'00'", "Title": "Supporting Agriculture Statistics Development"}}
