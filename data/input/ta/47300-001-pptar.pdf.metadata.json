Justification \n1.  The Government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the International Fund \nfor Agriculture Development (IFAD) to provide support for project preparation to ensure there is \nsound technical, financial and economic evidence to justify proceeding with the Project. The \ngovernment will contribute to the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) in terms of \nstaff and in-kind resources but does not have the capacity to prepare an investment project that \nwill adhere to the requirements of ADB, IFAD, and the government.1  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will define the scope, cost, selection and prioritization of project activities, \nfinancing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  procurement  strategy,  technology  issues, \ncapacity development needs and post-project operation and maintenance arrangements. It will \nensure adherence of the safeguard policies of ADB, IFAD and the government. The PPTA will \nprovide  guidance  in  actions  to  maximize  the  socioeconomic  benefits  such  as  impacts  on \npoverty, gender and fair employment practices. The PPTA will detail a viable project design and \nprepare a feasibility study report (FSR). It will provide advance drafts of the complete set of \ndocumentation necessary for the ADB and IFAD to proceed with internal processing. Table 1 \nsummarizes the outputs and activities.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nCompletion  Completion \nMajor Activities  Date (2014)  Major Outputs  Date (2014) \nSector assessment    An inception report  Feb  \nSocial poverty, and gender    An interim report  Mar  \nsurvey and impact assessment   \nand surveys  Mar \nAssessment of the technical    Draft final report; FSR, estimated project  Jun  \nfeasibility  costs, an IEE and EMP; a social action plan; \nDue diligence on the economic    a GAP; an economic and financial analysis \nand financial feasibility   report; a financial management assessment \nreport; a procurement capacity assessment \nreport; and draft RRP, and linked \nCompletion of safeguard   \ndocuments. \nrequirements \nCapacity development  May  Final report  Sep \nFSR = feasibility study report, GAP = gender action plan, IEE = initial environmental examination, EMP = environmental \nmanagement plan, PAM = project administration manual, RRP = report and recommendation of the President. \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n    \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  Originally a PPTA of $0.3 million was programmed to support the additional financing of the G0235-LAO Northern \nRural Infrastructure Sector Project. The Government prioritized to proceed immediately with a new livestock project \ninstead of additional financing for G0235-LAO. It was estimated that for a new project a total of $0.8 million is \nneeded for the PPTA. The $0.3 million for G0235-LAO was reallocated to the new project PPTA and an additional \n0.5 million was approved by SERD.  \n ", "2 \nC.  Cost Estimates and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n3.  The PPTA is estimated to cost $0.80 million equivalent, on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund V.
