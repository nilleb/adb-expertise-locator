An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been \nAssessment  undertaken, and a summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) \nis in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n   \nProject Description  The proposed Rural Road Sector Project (the Project) will (i) enhance \nthe economic integration of selected rural communities, which make \nup about 10% of the total rural population, through improvement of \nhigh  priority  rural  feeder  roads  totaling  about  220  kilometers  (km) \nconnected  to  the  national  road  network;  and  (ii)  strengthen  the \ntransport sector management capability.  \n \nTo maximize the benefits and reach out to the majority of the rural \npopulation in the country, the Project has been designed by actively \nmaintaining  operational    partnerships  with  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  (JICA),  US  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC), \nArmenian  Social  Investment  Fund  (ASIF),  international  Road \nAssessment Programme (iRAP), Joint United Nations Programme on \nHIV/AIDS  (UNAIDS),  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  (UNESCAP),  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP),  and  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development (USAID).  \n   \nRationale  Facing ongoing globalization, Armenia has progressively made efforts \nto  strengthen  the  interlinkage  between  its  economy  and  other \neconomies. The transport sector, particularly the road subsector, has \nplayed  an  increasingly  important  role  in  this  process.  As  the \npredominant  transport  mode,  road  transport  is  important  for  the \nnational economy and population and serves 98% of passenger traffic \nand 66% of freight traffic. \n \nThe majority of the road network traverses mountainous terrain, and \naltitudes frequently exceed 1,500 meters (m) above sea level. Steep \ngradients,  deep  cuttings,  and  high  embankments  are  common  in \nmountainous areas, and landslides occur frequently. Severe winter \nweather requires extensive efforts to maintain access. In many areas \nof the road network, high intensity rainfall and poor road drainage \ncause traffic problems and road infrastructure damage. The extreme \nclimate  also  causes  a  negative  impact  on  the  behavior  of  road \npavements, particularly because of freezing and thawing in the spring. \nIn Armenia, 1.2 million people (about 38% of the total population) live ", "ii   \nin rural areas, of which more than 45% is poor. Poverty has been \nreduced from 50.0% in 2000 to 29.8% in 2005 but poverty reduction \nhas been slower in rural areas. This is mainly because of constrained \neconomic activities\u2014primarily attributable to mountainous topography \nand poor transport infrastructure\u2014imposing high direct and indirect \ntransport  costs  on  the  rural  population,  and  limiting  income \nopportunities and expansion of rural industries. High transport costs \nand  constrained  road  access  have  also  negatively  affected  non-\nincome aspects of poverty in rural areas because of limited access to \nsocial service delivery institutions. \n \nTo respond to challenges created by road infrastructure deficiency, the \nGovernment\u2019s main road subsector policy until 2015 focuses on the \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  existing  roads  in  line  with  the \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Government adopted \nthree strategic goals for its road infrastructure development for the \nperiod 2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road \nnetwork  to  enhance  the  country\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and \nsupport the economy, (ii) improvement of the socioeconomic condition \nof the rural population through rehabilitation of rural roads in support of \nthe PRSP, and (iii) improvement of traffic safety. The Government \nplans  to  (i) complete  the  rehabilitation  of  old  bridges  and  other \nancillary facilities along the main highways by 2010, (ii) complete the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural \nroad transport demands in a cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure \nroad safety throughout all road categories.  \n \nTo address inefficient infrastructure as one of the main causes of \npoverty, the Government has set rural infrastructure development as \nthe cornerstone of the PRSP and has prepared rural infrastructure \ninvestment programs to reduce rural poverty. In the road sector, the \nGovernment developed a Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP) in \n2004, with assistance from the World Bank. The LRNP will improve \nthe access of rural communities to the national highway system in an \noptimal manner throughout the country. It targets 784 high priority \nrural feeder roads (secondary and local roads) totaling about 2,700 \nkm.  \n \nUnder the small-scale technical assistance for preparing the Project, \nthe overall cost of the LRNP has been preliminarily updated to an \nestimated $300 million. MCC has committed to provide $67 million for \nthe  rehabilitation  of  rural  roads  (totaling  about  940  km),  while  the \nGovernment is expected to budget nearly $50 million equivalent for \nthe improvement of rural roads (totaling 532 km). The Government \nhas requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide $30.6 \nmillion  to  upgrade  rural  roads  (totaling  about  220  km).  These \ninterventions  will  complete  the  improvement  of  about  60%  of  the \nLRNP  by  2011.  In  response  to  ADB\u2019s  resource  mobilization \nconsultations, JBIC is preparing a loan of about $50 million equivalent \nin  parallel  with  the  Project  by  using  the  sector  lending  approach \ndeveloped by ADB for the Project. With JBIC financing, more than ", "  iii\n75% of the LRNP roads would be improved by 2011. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will have an additional, positive, long-term impact on the \nfour project regions and the income and non-income dimensions of \npoverty in rural areas\u2014serving about 10% of the country\u2019s total rural \npopulation.  The  outcome  will  be  increased  mobility  and  improved \naccessibility to basic social service delivery institutions, employment \nopportunities, and domestic and international markets for communities \nand enterprises in rural and urban areas of the four regions. The \nfeeder roads improved under the Project will lead to (i) higher and \nmore frequent quality transport services available for road users; (ii) \nincreased  business  opportunities  for  private  sector  in  general, \nparticularly  agriculture  (including  agro-processing),  industrial,  and \nservice  sectors;  and  (iii)  more  synergetic  benefits  from  close \npartnerships in the road and other sectors relevant to the Project. \nFurthermore, the Project will improve transport sector management \nthrough the TA that will be attached to the Project. \n   \nProject  Investment  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $41.4 million, including \nPlan  taxes and duties of $5.8 million equivalent.  \n \nItem  Cost \n($ million) \nA.

The loan will have a \nterm of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years. There will be an \ninterest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC). Responsibility for planning, implementation, \nand  supervision  of  the  Project  will  be  delegated  to  the  Armenian \nRoads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State  Organization  (ARD) \nresponsible for planning and management of road construction and \nmaintenance work for the road assets under MOTC\u2019s purview. \n   \nImplementation  ARD will be responsible for (i) recruiting consultants for subproject \nArrangements   preparation and construction supervision, and auditing, (ii) preparing \n  bidding documents, (iii) monitoring and evaluation, and (iv) awarding \n  of  civil  works  contracts.  Within  ARD,  a  project  management  unit \n(PMU)will  be  established  to  manage  day-to-day  coordination, \nimplementation, and administration of the Project.  \n \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with \n  ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n  Civil  works  contracts  will  be  carried  out  by  using  international \n  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  and  the  post-qualification \n  method,  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan  for  the  Project \n  (Appendix 9). The procurement plan will be reviewed regularly and \n  amended  at  least  annually  covering  the  next  18  months  of \n  procurement  activity  during  project  implementation.  The  minimum \n  amount of a civil works contract procured through ICB is initially set at \n  more  than  $1  million  and  will  be  reviewed  during  implementation. \n  Procurement  through  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be \n  conducted under the Borrower\u2019s legislation on procurement, subject to \n  modification and clarifications set forth in the Loan Agreement. The \n  NCB thresholds are presently set at less than or equivalent to $1 \n  million for civil works and less than or equivalent to $500,000 for \n  goods. International shopping will be carried out for goods less than or \n \nequivalent to $100,000.  \n \n \n \nADB has approved advance contracting and retroactive financing for \n \nthe  consulting  services  for  subproject  preparation  and  project \n \nsupervision, monitoring, and evaluation. Up to 20% of the loan amount \n \nmay  be  used  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  retroactively  for \n \nconsulting services that have been engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to ", "  v\n  time), and incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 \n  months prior to loan signing. \n \n   \nAdvance Contracting  About 30 person-months of international consultants and 162 person-\nand Retroactive  months of national consultants will be required to work with the PMU \nFinancing Consulting  for subproject preparation (including detailed design; and technical, \nServices  environmental, economic, and social/resettlement due diligence); and \nproject supervision, monitoring, and evaluation (including technical, \nenvironmental,  economic,  social/resettlement  monitoring,  and \nevaluation). ARD will engage one consulting firm for the services. The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  through  the  quality  and  cost-based \nselection  method,  using  the  full  technical  proposal  procedures  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nGovernment  requested  ADB  to  carry  out  the  selection  of  the \nconsultants, as it is not familiar with ADB procedures. Once selected \nby ADB, the Government will negotiate with the selected consultants \nto finalize the consulting contracts and will retain the responsibility to \nsupervise the consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  immediate  main  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  long-term \nBeneficiaries  sustainable  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time \nstemming from the physical improvements, and (ii) the development of \nimproved  transport  and  road  management  systems.  The  overall \nproject economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 43.2%. \n \nThe Project will also improve the income and non-income dimensions \nof poverty in rural areas. About 32% of road users within the project \nareas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will \naccrue to about 40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are \nvery poor. Total net benefits accruing to the poor in the project areas \nare estimated at about $24 million, of which the very poor will receive \naround $4 million. In addition, improved road infrastructure will provide \nrural communities with enhanced access to social service delivery \ninstitutions including hospitals, clinics, and schools. This will support \nthe improvement of non-income aspects of poverty.  \n   \nRisks and  The  major  risks  arise  from  possible  project  preparation  delays, \nAssumptions  implementation delays, and low quality of works. To minimize these \n  risks, the Government and ADB have agreed on a feasible schedule \n  that  will  be  reviewed  regularly,  and  systematic  procedures  for \n  subproject submissions to ADB and project implementation that are \n  detailed in the project administration memorandum (PAM). Consultant \n  support  will  (i) ensure  high  quality  due  diligence  for  subproject \n  selection and preparation, and (ii) help ARD anticipate major factors in \n  the  critical  paths  of  project  implementation.  Furthermore,  advance \n  contracting of the consultancy services for subproject preparation and \n  construction supervision has further minimized risks of implementation \n  delays. To ensure high quality of works under the Project, consultant \n  support  has  been  designed  to  include  provisions  for  project \n  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  by  including  qualified \n ", "vi   \n  international and national road engineers and pavement specialists, \n  road  safety  experts,  transport  economists,  social/resettlement \n  specialists, and environment specialists. A further risk is cost overrun, \n  which has been reduced through (i) surveys of sample subprojects to \n  estimate  more  accurate  costs,  (ii)  sufficient  price  and  physical \n  contingencies,  and  (iii)  provision  of  consultants  for  subproject \n  preparation and project supervision. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In conjunction with the Project, technical assistance (TA) is proposed \nto support the development of a new transport sector strategy, and \nenhancement of the institutional capacity of MOTC and ARD. The total \ncost is estimated at $800,000. ADB will finance $600,000 equivalent \non a grant basis through ADB\u2019s TA funding program. A consulting firm \nwill be recruited through the quality and cost-based selection method, \nusing  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of the Consultants. \n \n \n ", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Armenia for the Rural Road Sector Project (the Project).1 The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for transport sector development support, and if \nthe Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Facing ongoing globalization, Armenia has progressively made efforts to strengthen the \ninterlinkage  between  its  economy  and  other  economies.  The  Government  has  accelerated \nstrengthening of the business environment to promote investment and exports. The Armenian \nTrade and Transport Facilitation Committee was established in 2002 and has played an active \nrole in (i) facilitating coordination between the Government, industry, private sector, and civil \nsociety; (ii) eliminating barriers to international and regional trade; (iii) bringing Armenian trade \nand transport procedures in line with international standards; and (iv) promoting harmonization of \ntrade and transport procedures in the South Caucasus. The committee has been working with \nsimilar committees in neighboring countries. Internally, issues related to customs procedures \nwere streamlined and other reforms have been implemented to develop private sector freight \ntransporters.  Armenia  has  signed  all  major  international  trade  and  transport  protocols  and \nconventions. \n \n3.  The  transport  sector,  particularly  the  road  subsector,  has  played  an  increasingly \nimportant role in this process. Road transport is the predominant transportation mode, supporting \nthe national economy and population by serving 98% of passenger traffic and 66% of freight \ntraffic. Growing demands for road transport have been supported by the Armenian road network \ninfrastructure  totaling  about  7,500  kilometers  (km),2 comprising  (i)  main  highways  including \ninternational  road  transport  corridors3 (roughly  1,560  km);  (ii)  secondary  roads  connecting \ncommunities  to  the  main  highways  (nearly  1,830  km);  and  (iii)  local  roads  serving  rural \ncommunities (around 4,100 km). The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is \nresponsible  for  the  main  highways  and  secondary  roads.  Responsibility  for  planning  and \nmanagement of road construction and maintenance work for the road assets under MOTC\u2019s \npurview is delegated to the Armenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization \n(ARD).  Regional  governments  are  responsible  for  local  roads.  An  estimated  90%  of  main \nhighways and secondary roads are in fair or good condition, while more than 60% of rural roads \nare in very poor or poor condition. About 84% of the rural road network is not passable during \nwinter. \n \n4.  The majority of the road network traverses mountainous terrain and altitudes frequently \nexceed  1,500  meters  (m)  above  sea  level.  Steep  gradients,  deep  cuttings,  and  high \nembankments are common in mountainous areas, and landslides occur frequently. The severe \nwinter weather requires extensive efforts to maintain access. In many areas of the road network, \nhigh intensity rainfall and poor road drainage cause traffic problems and road infrastructure \ndamage. The extreme climate also causes a negative impact on the behavior of road pavements, \nparticularly because of freezing and thawing in the spring. \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Consisting of paved roads (78%), gravel roads (19%), and earth roads (3%). \n3  Armenia has three Asian highway routes adding up to 958 km. The major part of the northern sections of the \ninternational road transport corridors have been improved with financial assistance from the World Bank and Lincy \nFoundation, while the southern part of the road transport corridor has been partially improved under World Bank \nassistance.  ", "2   \n5.  In Armenia, 1.2 million people (about 38% of the total population) live in rural areas, of \nwhich more than 45% are poor. Poverty has been reduced from 50.0% in 2000 to 29.8% in 2005 \nbut poverty reduction has been slower in rural areas. This is mainly because of constrained \neconomic  activities\u2014primarily  attributable  to  mountainous  topography  and  poor  transport \ninfrastructure\u2014imposing high direct and indirect transport costs on rural population, and limiting \nincome opportunities and the expansion of rural industries. High transport costs and constrained \nroad access have also negatively affected non-income aspects of poverty in rural areas because \nof limited access to social service delivery institutions. \n \n6.  To  respond  to  the  challenges  created  by  the  road  infrastructure  deficiency,  the \nGovernment\u2019s main road subsector policy until 2015 mainly focuses on the rehabilitation and \nmaintenance of the existing roads in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The \nGovernment adopted three strategic goals for its road infrastructure development for the period \n2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road network to enhance the country\u2019s \nbusiness competitiveness and support the economy, (ii) improvement of the socioeconomic \ncondition of the rural population through rehabilitation of rural roads in support of the PRSP, and \n(iii) improvement of traffic safety. The Government plans to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old \nbridges  and  other  ancillary  facilities  along  the  main  highways  by  2010,  (ii)  complete  the \nrehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges by 2015, (iii) meet rural road transport demands in \na cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure road safety throughout all road categories.  \n \n7.  The Government has been firmly committed to improving its road safety in conjunction \nwith  its  road  infrastructure  improvement  programs  in  response  to  rapid  motorization. 4 It \nestablished the National Road Safety Council in 2001 and has developed a road safety program \nthat identifies accident black spots. However, the situation is serious and deteriorating. Road \naccidents have increased from 1,021 in 2001 to 1,312 in 2005. In 2005, fatalities (310 persons) \nwere 20% higher than in 2004. The death rate per 10,000 vehicles is eight times as high as in \nthe safest European countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities.  \n \n8.  Rapid motorization has also caused air pollution through vehicular emissions. Throughout \nthe country, many trucks, buses, utility vehicles, and passenger cars use liquefied natural gas as \nfuel, emitting cleaner exhaust gas than that of vehicles using gasoline or diesel. Many liquefied \nnatural gas stations serve these vehicles. However, the numbers of gasoline or diesel vehicles \nare increasing and many old vehicles using such fuels still exist. Because of the mountainous \ntopography, many cities and towns are located at the bottom of basins where vehicular emission \ndoes not diffuse easily. Although air pollution caused by vehicular emissions has not yet become \na serious health hazard in the country, an increasing need for proactive actions is considered \nnecessary, especially in the major cities. An analysis of the road subsector is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.   Constraints \n \n9.  Despite the Government\u2019s effort to improve and restore the road network in line with its \n10-year  road  subsector  strategy  for  2006\u20132015,  the  road  subsector  has  not  been  able  to \ncontribute significantly to economic development and poverty reduction in the country. This is \nbecause  of  the  inadequacy  of  transport  infrastructure  and  transport  services  between  rural \ncommunities and centers of economic and social activities. Inadequate transport services in rural \nareas are caused by (i) mountainous, hilly, and rolling terrain; (ii) poor condition of existing roads; \nand  (iii)  high  transport  costs  on such  roads  in  poor  condition.5 A  cost-effective  road  asset \n                                                 \n4  During the last 5 years, vehicle fleets have increased by 30%. Road freight traffic grew by 38% and passenger traffic \nincreased by 61% during the same period, according to the National Statistics Agency. \n5  Poor  road  infrastructure  also  leads  to  economic  losses  and  limited  access  to  basic  services.  According  to \nWorld Bank. 2004. Rural Infrastructure in Armenia: Addressing Gaps in Service Delivery. Washington, DC, about ", "  3\nmanagement has to be developed to improve road connectivity for rural communities in the \noptimal routes, connecting such communities to the main road network or the nearest centers of \neconomic and social activities. Additional financing, besides central government budgets, needs \nto be mobilized to reap the maximum economic and social development potential in rural areas \nthrough the improvement of road transport connectivity. \n \n10.  In the road subsector, the Government has progressively pursued cost recovery and \nreduction measures, systematic project prioritization, and subsector monitoring activities. To \nstrengthen the overall road subsector monitoring functions, road infrastructure management can \nbe enhanced by improving the current management system used by ARD, which is responsible \nfor planning and management of road construction and maintenance work for the road assets \nunder MOTC\u2019s purview. Although the Highway Development and Management Model 4 (HDM4) \nwas introduced for the road asset management system, traffic data were generally a few years \nold and only very brief economic and social assessments were conducted. In 2005, to overcome \nthe traffic data deficiency problem, ARD introduced automatic traffic counters at 10 locations \nalong the six main highways, which feed traffic information to the current road management \nsystem.  A  more  comprehensive  road  project  selection  and  monitoring  system  needs  to  be \ndeveloped to reduce the cost of maintaining road assets by the systematic use of economic \nanalysis as a basis for selecting the most appropriate time and type of road maintenance, the \nuse of improved road technology, and timely maintenance interventions commensurate to the \navailable resources. Such a system needs to include specific monitoring functions with respect to \ntraffic counts and periodic road condition surveys over the road network, safety measures to \nminimize accidents, and social and environmental measures to minimize risks associated with \nroad improvements. \n \n11.  In 2007, the Government has allocated AMD16.16 billion, which is 0.6% of the gross \ndomestic product (GDP), for road maintenance. The Government\u2019s Medium-Term Expenditure \nFramework  for  2007\u20132009  envisages  increasing  allocations  to  operation  and  maintenance. \nProvision for domestic funding has been made through legislation requiring 10% of fuel tax \nrevenue  to  be  applied to  routine maintenance.  While the  Government  has  made  efforts  to \nachieve cost recovery measures for road network asset management, further cost reduction \nmeasures need to be introduced by competitive bidding procedures for periodic maintenance, \nsuch as the use of performance-based contracts (PBCs).  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n12.  Inefficient transport infrastructure increases transaction costs, constrains the economy \nfrom  realizing  its  full  potential,  and  limits  people  from  improving  income  and  non-income \ndimensions  of  poverty.  To  address  this  issue,  the  Government  has  set  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment as the cornerstone of its PRSP and has prepared rural infrastructure investment \nprograms to reduce rural poverty. In the road subsector, the Government developed a Lifeline \nRoad Network Program (LRNP) in 2004, with assistance from the World Bank. The LRNP will \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system in an optimal manner. It \ntargets 784 high priority rural feeder roads (secondary and local roads) totaling about 2,700 km. \n                                                                                                                                                            \n40% of total survey participants replied that significant volumes of agriculture produce are lost during transportation; \n18%  of  respondents  put  the  figure  at  40%,  and  24%  of  respondents  considered  that  30%  is  lost  during \ntransportation. Poor road conditions in rural areas have constrained timely access to health and other social \nservices, and access to schools (including the time spent in education). Bus services and/or road freight services \nhave been reduced or stopped in some rural areas, as operators try to avoid damage to their vehicles or perceive \nhigh  vehicle  operating  costs  of  driving  on  poor/very  poor  condition  roads.  On  the  other  hand,  after  the \nLincy Foundation improved road access of the Noyemberyan area in the Tavush region located in the northeastern \npart of Armenia, the Noyemberyan area\u2019s agricultural potential has been developed, and export of agriculture \nproduce and processed agriculture products is taking place from this area to the Russian Federation and Georgia. \n ", "4   \nUnder the small-scale technical assistance for preparing the Project,6 the overall cost of the \nLRNP was preliminarily updated to an estimated $300 million at currently prevailing market \nprices.  \n \n13.  In 2005, MOTC introduced PBCs for routine and winter road maintenance covering all \nroads under MOTC\u2019s responsibility (totaling 3,393 km) for 3 years. Local authorities have carried \nout PBCs for routine and winter road maintenance along local roads. In conjunction with its rural \nroad  rehabilitation  project,  the  Millennium  Challenge  Corporation  (MCC)  will  review  PBC \nperformance in 2007. Through a regular project coordination mechanism, MCC will share the \nfindings of the PBC review with ADB and the project management unit (PMU) to be established \nfor the Project. ARD has also introduced a standard provision in civil works contracts to ensure \nincorporation of environmental management plans (EMPs) in construction works. The standard \nprovision requires all contractors to provide financial resources ranging from 1.5% to 10.0% of \nthe contract amounts for EMPs. \n \n14.  In 2006, MCC committed to provide $67 million for the rehabilitation of rural feeder roads \n(totaling  around  940  km).  The  Government  is  expected  to  finance  nearly  $50  million  for \nimprovement of rural roads (totaling 532 km) for the next 5 years and has requested ADB to \nprovide $30.6 million to upgrade rural roads (adding up to nearly 220 km). In response to ADB\u2019s  \nresource  mobilization  consultations,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is \nconsidering financing (about $50 million equivalent) in parallel with the Project by using the \nsector lending approach developed by ADB for the Project.  \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n15.  During project processing, MOTC/ARD and ADB have maintained policy dialogue in \nrelation to the transport sector, particularly in relation to (i) road sector reforms and restructuring \nmatters, (ii) cost-effective road interventions, (iii) road safety, and (iv) pollution and vehicle \nemissions. The Government and ADB have agreed to continue active policy dialogue during \nproject implementation. In particular, the development of a competitive construction industry and \nlogistics industry will be needed to enjoy the full benefits of the investment in road improvements \nand to support the competitiveness of the national economy. MOTC/ARD and ADB will continue \nto have regular policy dialogue on these issues. ADB will review and assist the Government\u2019s \nefforts in key policy areas that emerge from the dialogue, and through the TA that will be \nattached to the Project in support of the development of the transport sector. \n \n4.  ADB Strategy and Partnerships \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Armenia7 is to focus ADB interventions on (i) rural \ndevelopment, (ii) private sector development, and (iii) regional cooperation. The Project has been \nformulated in line with this strategy. \n \n17.  In developing its support to the road subsector, ADB has actively pursued partnership \nopportunities with external funding agencies active in the country. The Lincy Foundation, MCC of \nthe United States and the World Bank are the major external financing sources for the road \nsubsector\u2014providing the road subsector with a total of nearly $216 million since 1995. During \n1995\u20132004, the World Bank financed two loans for road improvement, including institutional \nstrengthening  of  ARD,  a  road  safety  program,  and  institutional  support  to  MOTC.  It \ncommissioned  a  transport  sector  review8 in  1997  and  is  actively  supporting  a  road  safety \nprogram in Armenia. The Lincy Foundation, established by the Armenian diaspora in the US, has \n                                                 \n6  The small-scale technical assistance was financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.

", "  5\nprovided two grants for road improvement of selected main and secondary highways and road \nupgrading in the capital city, totaling $86.9 million during 2001\u20132003. The Government of Japan \nhas provided Armenia with a technical cooperation project and study totaling about $3 million \nequivalent to finance a landslide survey, and a grant (about $5.0 million equivalent) to finance \nroad construction equipment for the capital city, through the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA). JBIC is preparing a loan of $50 million equivalent for the LRNP in parallel with \nthe Project by using the same subproject selection criteria developed by ADB. The United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is conducting a \npre-feasibility study on the southernmost part of the international transport corridor between \nGoris and Kapan (totaling about 60 km) with the potential total project cost ranging from $15 \nmillion to $30 million. ADB has maintained coordination with the international Road Assessment \nProgramme (iRAP), which has started developing a road safety assessment program for the \ninternational road corridors in Armenia.9 External assistance to the road subsector is in Appendix \n3. \n \n18.  The Government and ADB have carefully identified the subprojects to be financed under \nthe Project by avoiding duplication and by systematically planning road subprojects to achieve \nmaximum  synergy  among  the  rural  roads  rehabilitation  project  financed  by  MCC,  the \nGovernment, and the Project. Furthermore, to maximize the benefits of the Project\u2014and serve \nadditional traffic generated from projects in the agriculture, small and medium-sized industry, and \nsocial sectors effectively\u2014the Government and ADB have identified the subprojects for the \nProject, taking into consideration all major relevant projects financed by external assistance. This \nincludes the MCC-financed irrigated agriculture project ($146 million). The Project, together with \nthe two MCC-financed projects (road and agriculture), will benefit more than 73% of the rural \npopulation in Armenia. The Armenia Social Investment Fund (ASIF), with assistance from the \nWorld Bank, is implementing community-driven development in Armenia to reduce non-income \npoverty in rural areas. The World Bank has so far completed ASIF I and II to finance 619 \nmicroprojects, and approved ASIF III in September 2006. Road improvement under the Project \nwill  improve  rural  communities\u2019  access  to  major  economic  activities  in  the  capital  city  and \nregional centers, as well as local social service delivery institutions supported by the Government \nand ASIF initiatives. The Armenian Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Market Development \nProject financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has mainly \nsupported the development of small and medium-sized agro-processing industries, which require \ngood  rural  roads  to  gather  agricultural  produce  and  other  inputs  and  deliver  products  to \ninternational and domestic markets efficiently. The Government is progressively implementing \nthe National Program on the Response to the HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) with assistance from \nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). The United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP) is actively implementing its programs on anti-human trafficking in response \nto the recently increasing mobility of people, particularly international movements. \n \n5.  Need for ADB Support for the LRNP \n \n19.  The LRNP will require additional funding of about $180 million (estimated at current \nprices, net of MCC and government commitments totaling about $117 million). The majority of \nthe rural population in Armenia depends heavily on road transport for their daily lives and access \nto jobs, markets, and basic social services. Failure to implement the LRNP would prolong rural \nremoteness and poverty in rural communities, and exacerbate the outward migration of labor. \nThus, the Government has requested financial support from ADB to meet part of its resource gap \nfor the LRNP.  \n                                                 \n9 Possibly to Georgia as well. The main component will be an international Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) \nroad assessment of the international road transport corridors and follow-up activities to improve road safety in \nArmenia, in conjunction with World Bank support to road safety. \n ", "6   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The Project will have an additional, positive, long-term impact on the four project regions \nand income and non-income dimensions of poverty in rural areas, serving about 10% of the total \nrural population in the country. The outcome will be increased mobility and improved accessibility \nto basic social service delivery institutions, employment opportunities, and to domestic and \ninternational markets for the communities and enterprises in rural and urban areas of the four \nregions. The feeder roads improved under the Project will lead to (i) higher and more frequent \nquality  transport  services  available  for  road  users;  (ii)  increased  business  opportunities  for \nprivate sectors in general, particularly agriculture (including agro-processing), industrial, and \nservice sectors; and (iii) more synergetic benefits from close partnerships in the road and other \nsectors relevant to the Project. The Project will improve transport sector management through \nTA that will be attached to the Project.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The main outputs of the Project will be (i) about 220 km of improved rural roads;10 \n(ii) development of an improved transport sector management system, including a new transport \nsector strategy to strengthen the capability of MOTC; and (iii) establishment of an improved road \nasset management system to enhance the institutional capacity of ARD.   \n \n22.  The physical improvements envisaged under the Project will increase the percentage of \nroads  in  good  condition  from  12%  to  15%  at  the  national  level.11 Road  roughness  will  be \nsignificantly improved from the average international roughness index of 10.9 m/km (poor) to a \nrange of 3.0\u20134.0 m/km (fair/good). Road transport costs and travel time will be reduced by more \nthan 40%. \n \n1.  Road Connectivity Improvement Component \n23.  This component focuses on rehabilitation of high priority rural roads totaling about 220 \nkm. The subprojects for the Project have been selected and prioritized by using the HDM4; and \ntaking  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  concerns  into  consideration.  Special \nattention has been given to the integrity of the overall road rehabilitation activities supported by \nMCC,  the  Government,  and  the  Project.  The  selection  criteria  and  approval  process  of \nsubprojects are in Appendix 4. The list of prioritized subprojects identified for the Project is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n2.  Road Infrastructure Management Component \n \n24.  The  component  consists  of  (i)  overall  project  management  by  ARD\u2019s  PMU,  and \n(ii) subproject preparation and construction supervision support to the PMU. The main objectives \nof this component are to ensure (i) high quality of preconstruction work, including all necessary \ndue diligence and detailed design for the subprojects; (ii) timely and high quality implementation \nof the subprojects; (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the subprojects (covering technical, road \nsafety,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  aspects);  and  (iv)  annual  auditing  of  project \nexpenditures. On-the-job training by international consultants will also be conducted to improve \nARD\u2019s skills in road rehabilitation. \n \n                                                 \n10 Includes two road subprojects totaling 24.9 km along the main highways. These subprojects were included to \nmaximize the benefits of rural road improvement in the Vardanis district of Gegharkunik region.  \n11 The Project, together with MCC and the Government, will improve the share of good road condition from 12% to \n29% in 2011. With JBIC financing, the overall share of good roads will be further increased to about 35% during the \nsame period. ", "  7\nC.  Special Features \n25.  The  major  value  added  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  flexible  financing  and  enhanced \nresource mobilization for the LRNP using ADB\u2019s sector lending modality and (ii) maximized \nimpacts on rural poverty reduction through strong partnerships. \n  \n26.  Sector Lending Modality. The Project has been conceptualized to help the Government \nachieve its poverty reduction and economic development goals by financing part of the LRNP, \nwhich targets 784 high priority rural feeder roads (secondary and local roads) totaling about \n2,700 km. The Government has a well-developed overall road sector plan (2006\u20132015) to meet \nthe priority development needs of the road subsector and the Government\u2019s PRSP. ARD has \nsufficient  institutional  capacity,  developed  through  the  implementation  of  two  World  Bank-\nfinanced  projects,  to  implement  the  LRNP  in  selecting  and  implementing  subprojects.  The \nGovernment\u2019s road subsector policies, developed with World Bank assistance, are appropriate. \nThus, ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is best suited to meet the financing need. In addition, ADB\u2019s \nsector lending modality, the subproject criteria, and the environmental and social frameworks will \nallow the Government to mobilize additional financing from JBIC and others for the LRNP. \n \n27.  Enhanced  Partnerships.  The  Project  has  been  designed  to  maximize  benefits  by \nactively maintaining operational partnerships with ASIF, JBIC, JICA, iRAP, Lincy Foundation, \nMCC, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCAP, USAID, and World Bank. The aim has been to achieve \nmaximum synergy to impact rural poverty. Although HIV/AIDS and human trafficking incidence is \nrelatively low in Armenia at this moment, the PMU and ADB will continue to have proactive \npartnerships with UNAIDS and UNDP in these fields during project implementation. Further, the \nPMU and ADB will continue to pursue regular coordination with the World Bank and iRAP, \nregarding road safety.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n28.  The project cost is estimated at $41.4 million, including taxes and duties of $5.8 million, \nand interest and other charges on the loans from ADB during construction (Table 1).

MOTC will be the Executing Agency (EA). Responsibility for planning, implementation, \nand supervision of the Project will be delegated to ARD, a noncommercial state organization \nresponsible for planning and management of road construction and maintenance work for the \nroad  assets  under  MOTC\u2019s  purview.  ARD  will  be  responsible  for  recruiting  consultants  for \nsubproject  preparation  and  construction  supervision,  and  auditing;  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments; and monitoring, evaluation, and awarding of contracts. Within ARD, a PMU12 will be \nestablished  to  manage  day-to-day  coordination,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the \nProject, while PMU\u2019s team responsible for civil works contract management at the regional level \nwill supervise day-to-day civil works contracts. ADB and PMU will maintain close coordination \nwith JBIC, while they will also maintain partnership with other partners related to the Project. \nProject organization and implementation arrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \n32.  In accordance with the Government\u2019s requirements for externally funded projects,13 a \nproject governing council (PGC), comprising representatives from key stakeholders within and \nexternal to MOTC, will provide overall oversight and supervision for the Project. The PGC will \n                                                 \n12 It is estimated that 15 staff members are required for the PMU. ARD has so far identified 9 members comprising (i) \nhead (deputy director general level), (ii) a procurement officer, (iii) an environmental officer, (iv) a financial officer, (v) \na construction officer, (vi) two construction specialists, (vii) an administrative assistant/interpreter/translator, and (viii) \na driver. Some of them have operational experience with the World Bank road projects. \n13 Republic of Armenia. 1999.

Yerevan. \n(Resolution No. 765, dated 22 December 1999).  ", "  9\ncomprise 11 members: (i) minister of MOTC, (ii) first deputy minister of MOTC, (iii) first deputy \nminister of finance and economy, (iv) first deputy minister of justice, (v) deputy minister of \nterritorial administration, (v) five representatives from civil society, and (vi) head of the PMU. The \nPGC meetings will be held at least quarterly, and the PMU will report and seek guidance from \nthe PGC on major procurement issues and policy decisions. The PGC will also provide a forum \nfor coordinating activities among project beneficiaries. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, taking the construction season (May\u2013\nNovember) in Armenia into consideration. Necessary preparatory work has been programmed \nfor completion before the construction season. Twenty-four road links preliminarily identified for \nADB financing will be improved through five international competitive bidding (ICB) packages, \nwhich will be completed in 2008 and 2009, by commissioning them simultaneously. Advance \naction on the engagement of consultants for subproject preparation and project supervision is \nongoing. Surveys and detailed designs are expected to be completed by the end of 2007 and \nsubsequent bid documentation will start in parallel with the detailed design preparation. Bidding \nand award of civil works contracts has been scheduled for completion by April 2008. The Project \nwill be completed when the contractors\u2019 liability for the repair of defects and maintenance ends in \n2010. An indicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n34.  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works contracts will be carried out by \nusing ICB procedures with post-qualification and as described in the procurement plan for the \nProject (Appendix 9). The procurement plan may be reviewed regularly and amended at least \nannually covering the next 18 months of procurement activity during project implementation. The \nminimum amount of a civil works contract procured through ICB is initially set at more than $1 \nmillion and will be reviewed during implementation. Procurement through national competitive \nbidding (NCB) will be conducted under the Borrower\u2019s legislation on procurement, subject to \nmodification  and  clarifications  set  forth  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  NCB  thresholds  are \npresently set at less than or equivalent to $1 million for civil works and less than or equivalent to \n$500,000 for goods. International shopping will be carried out for goods less than or equivalent to \n$100,000. \n \n35.  The country presently imports bitumen required for road improvement from non-ADB \nmember countries. Restricting bitumen procurement to ADB member countries may preclude \ncivil works contractors under the Project from obtaining the best economic terms, and may \nseriously erode economic efficiency. It is proposed that civil work contractors under the Project \nbe allowed to procure bitumen for road improvement from all countries, including from countries \nthat are not ADB members.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n36.  About 30 person-months of international consultants and about 162 person-months of \nnational consultants will be required to work with the PMU for subproject preparation (including \ndetailed  design  and  technical,  environmental,  economic,  social/resettlement  due  diligence); \npreparation of contracts; and project supervision, monitoring, and evaluation (including technical, \nenvironmental, economic, social/resettlement monitoring, and evaluation). ARD will engage one \nconsulting firm for the services. The consultants will be recruited through the quality and cost-\nbased selection method, using full technical proposal procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference  for  the  consulting  services  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  Government \n ", "10   \nrequested ADB to carry out the selection of the consultants, as it is not familiar with ADB \nprocedures. Once selected by ADB, the Government will negotiate with the selected consultants \nto finalize the consulting contracts and will retain the responsibility to supervise the consultants. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n37.  ADB  has  approved  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  the  consulting \nservices for subproject preparation and project supervision, monitoring, and evaluation. Up to \n20% of the loan amount may be used to finance eligible expenditures retroactively for consulting \nservices  that  have  been  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and incurred prior to the loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior to \nloan signing.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government including the EA and the Implementing Agency (IA). Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Agreement and bidding documents for the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the IA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  requires  the  Borrower  to  publish  within  2  weeks  of \nreceiving ADB\u2019s \u201cno objection\u201d in an English language newspaper or well-known and freely \naccessible website the results identifying the bid and lot numbers, and the following information: \n(i) name of each bidder who submitted a bid; (ii) bid prices as read out at bid opening; (iii) name \nand evaluated prices of each bid that was evaluated; (iv) name of bidders whose bids were \nrejected and the reasons for their rejection; and (v) name of the winning bidder, and the price it \noffered, as well as the duration and summary scope of the contract awarded. For contracts \nsubject to post-review, the Borrower shall publish the results no later than the date of contract \naward. \n \n7.  Financial Management \n \n40.  ARD\u2014the IA responsible for the flow of funds, accounting, reporting, and auditing\u2014will \nhandle  the  financial  management  functions  of  the  Project.  An  assessment  of  the  financial \narrangements for the Project was undertaken in May 2007. Based on the financial management \nassessment, it was established that ARD has acceptable financial management arrangements: \n(i)  accounting  and  reporting  is  performed  with  the  use  of  appropriate  software,  which  was \nassessed to be a reliable and flexible system to record and report with the required details and \nformats; (ii) the bookkeeping system allows the storing of all supporting financial documentation \nrelating to the Project in a systematic manner; (iii) the internal control system is adequate; and \n(iv)  ARD  accounting  staff  have  extensive  experience  with  World  Bank  procedures  for \ndisbursement and financial management under the two road project financed by the World Bank, \nincluding financial management reports. According to the World Bank, financial management \nsupervisions and annual audits conducted in conjunction with the World Bank-financed road \nprojects, implemented by ARD, confirmed the satisfactory financial management arrangement. In \naddition,  ARD  accounting  staff  was  given  training  sessions  on  ADB\u2019s  loan  disbursement \nprocedures during the financial management assessment (Supplementary Appendix B). \n ", "  11\n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n41.  The ADB loan proceeds for the Project will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and reduce cash flow difficulties in pre-financing project expenditures, advance \ndisbursement through the imprest fund procedure is requested by MOTC, the EA. An imprest \naccount  will  be  set  up  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  will  be \nexclusively used to finance ADB\u2019s share of eligible expenditures. The imprest account will be \nmanaged by ARD, the IA. The total advances to be financed through the imprest account will not \nexceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. For large civil works contracts under the Project, direct payment procedures will apply. If \nthe  Government  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures  from  its  own  resources,  reimbursement \nprocedures will be used. To expedite funds flow and simplify the documentation process, the \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest \naccount  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual \ncontract.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed, \nliquidated, or replenished, based on the full supporting documentation process.  \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n42.  ARD, through MOTC, will submit quarterly and annual progress reports to ADB, indicating \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review periods, steps taken to remedy the \nproblems or proposed countermeasures, the proposed activities, and expected progress during \nthe following periods. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the EA will submit to \nADB a project completion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and \nother information that ADB may request. \n \n43.  ARD will maintain separate accounts and financial statements for the Project, which will \nbe audited annually by international independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Auditors will be \nselected and engaged by quality and cost-based selection or the consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Annual audit \nreports will include an opinion on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial \ncovenants included in the loan agreements, if any, including the use of imprest accounts and \nstatement of expenditures procedures. ARD will provide ADB with audit reports in English, \ntogether with audited accounts and financial statements, no later than 6 months after the end of \neach fiscal year. \n \n44.  The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of \na financial statement is delayed more than 6 months (i) no commitment letter will be issued, if \napplicable; and (ii) ADB might not approve new contact awards. If the delay is more than 12 \nmonths, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loans may be canceled. \n \n  10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n45.  The  PMU,  assisted  by  the  consultants  for  subproject  preparation  and  construction \nsupervision,  will  establish  a  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to \nmonitor and evaluate the impacts, outcomes, outputs, and activities in relation to the targets and \nbenchmarks set for each subproject and the Project. \n \n46.  During the preparation of a group of subprojects for implementation, ARD and ADB will \nagree on a set of baseline values of economic, social, environmental, and poverty reduction \nimpact indicators for each subproject. With the assistance of the subproject preparation and \nproject  supervision  consultants,  ARD  will  conduct  participatory  consultations  and  necessary \nsurveys, and collect and assess data at intervals agreed with ADB. Findings of the assessments, \n ", "12   \ntogether with ARD\u2019s views, will be submitted as part of quarterly reports of ARD to ADB. A \ncomplete analysis of impacts and outcomes will be performed at project completion and 3 years \nafter. \n \n11.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n47.  ARD will ensure that the Project is implemented with the active participation of relevant \nstakeholders,  using  participatory  practices.  As  part  of  the  project  preparation,  more  than \n16 consultations covering both environmental and social issues were held with stakeholders, \nincluding directly affected people, representatives of local governments, and the Council of \nElderly (key persons in the communities). Issues and activities related to project implementation \nwere discussed and concerns expressed (especially road safety and increased exposure to \ncommunicable diseases and human trafficking) have been integrated in the project design. \nStakeholder  consultation  and  participation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation. \nRegular PGC meetings will systematically give opportunities to stakeholders to express their \nviews and participate in the decision-making process during project implementation. \n \n12.  Project Reviews \n48.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB, a midterm review of the project implementation will \nbe carried out during the first quarter of 2009. Representatives of ADB and the Government will \ntake part in the review, which will focus on impacts\u2014particularly those relating to institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects\u2014and  poverty \nreduction. Other parameters that might negatively affect the economic viability and other relevant \naspects  will  be  assessed  during  the  review,  which  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \nadjustments. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n49.  The Government\u2019s transport sector strategy was prepared in 1997 with assistance from \nthe World Bank.14 In the last decade, international economic integration has increasingly gained \nspeed. New technologies and expertise have emerged, and there has been growing concern \nover risks associated with mobility improvement. Considering these, the Government finds a \ngreat need for the development of a new strategy in order to respond to transport demands \neffectively  and  address  both  positive  and  negative  aspects  of  transport  improvement\u2014\nparticularly the road subsector, which is the predominant transport mode in Armenia. Since the \nroad subsector has strong interlinkage with other transport modes, the development of a new \noverall transport sector strategy will support the road subsector effectively. The Project will be \nADB\u2019s first intervention in the transport sector in Armenia, so such a transport sector strategy will \nassist ADB in developing its partnership with the Government to implement necessary reforms, \nprioritize investment, and strengthen much needed capacity for the transport sector, including \ninstitutional capacity development of the Project\u2019s EA and IA. \n \n50.  TA will be provided to improve transport sector performance so that it can make a \nsustainable contribution to economic development and poverty reduction in Armenia, which is \nfacing ongoing globalization, technological advancement, and risks associated with increasing \nmobility. The main purposes of the TA are to support both the development of a new transport \nsector strategy and enhancement of the institutional capacity of MOTC and ARD. The TA will \nassess in detail all modes of transport, and identify strategic uses of resources for priority areas \nfor sector development and operational needs for a 10-year horizon. The TA will equip MOTC \nwith a new transport sector strategy comprising a new vision and road map, which will be the \nGovernment\u2019s key document guiding policies and investments in the transport sector, including \ntransport facilitation for 2009\u20132019. Specifically, the TA will (i) develop a reform action plan, \n                                                 \n14 World Bank. 1997. Republic of Armenia Transport Sector Review. Washington, DC. ", "  13\n(ii) develop a management information system for MOTC and ARD, (iii) define a long-term \ntransport sector investment plan,  (iv) support international transport facilitation and logistics \nsector development, (v) provide a capacity building development plan in all aspects of the \ntransport  sector,  and  (vi)  support  systematic  resource  mobilization  for  transport  sector \ninvestments. The total TA amount is estimated at $800,000. ADB will finance $600,000 while the \nGovernment will finance $200,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The consultants will be recruited through the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod, using simplified technical proposal procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of the Consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n51.  The main immediate benefits of the Project include long-term sustainable savings in \nvehicle operating costs and travel time, stemming from physical improvements including the \ndevelopment of an improved road management system. The overall investments will increase \nmobility and accessibility to basic social service delivery institutions, employment opportunities, \nand domestic and international markets for communities and enterprises in rural and urban areas \nof  the  four  regions.  Indirect  benefits  expected  from  the  Project  include  (i)  increased  local \ncontractors\u2019  capability,  (ii)  enhanced  transport  sector  management  capability  of  MOTC,  (iii) \nimproved road infrastructure management capability of ARD, (iv) reduced road accidents, (v) \nimproved awareness of risks associated with increased mobility and countermeasures, and (vi) \nincreased awareness of vehicular air pollution and countermeasures. \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n52.  Economic  assessment  of  each  of  the  subprojects  included  in  the  Project  has  been \nperformed  based  on  the  expected  benefits  from  the  physical  improvement.  The  benefits \nconsidered are (i) vehicle operating cost savings for passenger and freight traffic resulting from \nthe improvements to riding quality, (ii) generated traffic from the irrigated agriculture project \nfinanced by MCC,15 (iii) induced traffic, and (iv) time savings. \n \n53.  The overall project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 43.2%, while \nnet present value (NPV) is $83.0 million. The impact of a cost increase of 20%, a benefits \ndecrease of 20%, and a combined cost increase and benefit decrease of 20% on the EIRR and \nthe NPV are shown in Table 4. The economics of the Project are highly robust, as illustrated by \nthe switching values which would reduce NPV to zero (an EIRR of 12%): an increase of 332% in \neconomic cost, a decrease of 77% in project benefits, or a simultaneous increase/decrease of \n62%. Economic analysis is detailed in Appendix 10. \n \nTable 4: Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values \nItem  EIRR  NPV   \n  (%)  ($ million)   \nBase Case  43.2  83.0   \nCost +20%  37.3  78.0   \nBenefits \u201320%  36.2  61.4   \nCost/Benefits +/\u201320%  31.2  56.4   \n  Cost  Benefits  Costs/Benefits \nSwitching Valuesa  332%  -77%   +/-62% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \na To reduce NPV to zero. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n15 The Project is located within the MCC project areas of 5 irrigation schemes (out of 21), with incremental increase in \nthe irrigated areas totaling 12,600 hectares.  \n ", "14   \nB.   Project Sustainability \n54.  The Government has increased road budgets and is committed to providing adequate \nfunds to maintain the roads after the improvements, particularly the LRNP. PBCs will reduce \nmaintenance costs. ARD\u2019s road subsector management capabilities will be improved over time. \nCompliance with safeguards has been pursued throughout project processing and will continue \nduring project implementation to ensure environmental and social sustainability of the Project. \nThese will create a long-term sustainable environment for the road assets improved under the \nProject. \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n55.  Rehabilitation work under the Project will generally follow the existing carriageway width, \nwhich is about half of the right-of-way. The Project is categorized B and is expected to have \ninsignificant environmental impacts during both construction and operation stages. The nearest \ndistance from any of the subprojects to the protected areas (national park or state reserve) is \nmore than 1 km. No ecological or biodiversity impacts are expected. Ten public consultations \ninvolving a total of 72 local stakeholders have been held and general feedback has been positive \nabout the Project, with little environmental concern. The environmental assessment and review \nprocedures  included  in  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  have  covered  the  future \nsubproject screening and selection process and criteria, and will be followed according to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy 16  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines. 17  The  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) prepared under the IEE has included mitigation measures, monitoring \nprograms,  and  capacity-building  programs.  Environmental  impact  will  be  assessed  during \nsubproject preparation,  and  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated  during  project  implementation. \nEMPs and IEEs will be prepared for the subprojects based on the detailed design and will be \nincluded in the standard contract documents, which require 1.5\u201310.0% of the contract values for \nEMPs.  This  process  will  be supported  and  monitored  by  the  consulting  firm  for  subproject \npreparation and construction supervision. A summary IEE (SIEE), including the environmental \nassessment and review framework (EARF), is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nD.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n \n56.  The Project will also improve income and non-income dimensions of poverty in rural \nareas. The Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total \nproject net benefits that would accrue to the poor and the very poor. About 32% of road users \nwithin the project areas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will accrue to \nabout 40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are very poor. A distribution analysis \nindicates that the Project will yield a poverty impact ratio of 0.28. Total net benefits accruing to \nthe poor in the project areas are estimated to amount to about $24 million, of which the very poor \nwill receive about $4 million. Improved road infrastructure will provide rural communities with \nenhanced access to social service delivery institutions including hospitals, clinics, and schools. \nThis  will  support  improvement  of  the  non  income-related  causes  of  poverty.  The  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nE.  Indigenous People \n57.  An  initial  social  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project  processing,  covering  all \npotential  subprojects.  Detailed  socioeconomic  evaluation  of  15  communities 18  has  been \nconducted and more than six consultation meetings were held in these communities. Extensive \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002. Environment Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n17  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila.  \n18 With a total population of about 25,820 persons (about 20% of the total people living within the project areas) along \nfour subprojects in Gegharkunik (road link no. 2), Ararat (road link no. 17), and Kotayk (road link nos. 14 and 27). ", "  15\nresearch  on  the  remaining  project  areas  has  also  been  conducted.  The  assessment  has \nconcluded that there are no indigenous people living in the project areas. Thus, there is no \nindigenous peoples\u2019 issue. \n \nF.  Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees \n \n58.  A total of nearly 19,000 internally displaced persons and refugees (IDPRs) live in the \nproject areas, which constitute about 15% of the total community population. Of 19,000 IDPRs, \nabout 18,000 persons are refugees, while the remainder is internally displaced persons. The \nProject will provide the IDPRs with improved access to markets, job opportunities, and basic \nsocial services. The IDPRs do not live near the road alignments, so there will be no negative \nimpact on the IDPRs during construction. Surveys carried out during project preparation have \nconcluded that negative impacts on IDPRs are very limited. As ADB\u2019s sector lending modality is \nadopted for the Project, the internally displaced persons and refugees development framework \n(IDPRDF) has been prepared for these people (Supplementary Appendix E). The consulting \nservices for subproject preparation and project supervision will review potential negative impacts \non these people, and prepare specific actions and development plans for IDPRs, if necessary. \n \nG.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n59.  Rehabilitation work under the Project will generally follow the existing carriageway widths, \nwhich are about half of the right-of-way widths. Thus, no resettlement is expected. It has been \nassessed during surveys and consultations that there is no encroachment to the subprojects. \nHowever, since ADB\u2019s sector lending modality has been used for the Project, a resettlement \nframework  (RF)  was  prepared  to  establish  the  policies  and  procedures  for  compensation, \nrehabilitation, and resettlement of people affected by the Project. The provisions of the RF will be \napplicable in all cases where land acquisition and/or resettlement are/is required as part of the \nimplementation of a subproject. The RF builds on the laws of the Government of the Republic of \nArmenia\u2014principally the Constitution, 1995; the Land Code, 2001; and the Civil Code, 1998\u2014\nand ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.19 Since government legislation is not fully consistent \nwith ADB policy, the provisions of the RF will take precedence over relevant decrees currently in \nforce in Armenia wherever a gap exists between the ADB policy and Armenian laws. The RF is in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \nH.  Risks \n60.  The major risks arise from possible project preparation delays, implementation delays, \nand low quality of works. To minimize these risks, the Government and ADB have agreed on a \nfeasible  schedule  that will  be  reviewed  regularly,  and  systematic  procedures  for  subproject \nsubmissions to ADB and project implementation that are detailed in the project administration \nmemorandum (PAM). Consultant support will (i) ensure high quality due diligence for subproject \nselection and preparation, and (ii) help ARD anticipate major factors in the critical paths of \nproject  implementation.  Furthermore,  advance  contracting  of  the  consultancy  services  for \nsubproject  preparation  and  construction  supervision  has  further  minimized  risks  of  \nimplementation delays. To ensure high quality of works under the Project, consultant support has \nbeen  designed  to  include  provisions  for  project  supervision,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  by \nincluding qualified international and national road engineers and pavement specialists, road \nsafety  experts,  transport  economists,  social/resettlement  specialists,  and  environment \nspecialists. A further risk is cost overrun, which has been reduced through (i) surveys of sample \nsubprojects to estimate more accurate costs, (ii) sufficient price and physical contingencies, and \n(iii) provision of consultants for subproject preparation and project supervision. \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1995.

Road Subsector Strategy \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s road subsector strategy was first defined in the transport strategy \ndeveloped with World Bank assistance in 1997. The four major strategic pillars are (i) the \nintroduction  of  cost  recovery  measures,  (ii)  the  adoption  of  cost  reduction  measures, \n(iii) systematic  project  prioritization,  and  (iv)  subsector  monitoring  activities.  The  major \ndevelopments and needs are as follows: \n \n(i)  Cost recovery measures. Provision for domestic funding has been made \nthrough legislation requiring 10% of fuel tax revenue to be applied to routine \nmaintenance. \n \n(ii)  Cost  reduction  measures.  In  2005,  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications  (MOTC)  introduced  performance-based  contracts  (PBCs) \nfor routine and winter road maintenance covering all roads under MOTC\u2019s \nresponsibility  (totaling  3,393  kilometers  [km])  for  3  years,  while  local \nauthorities have carried out PBCs for routine and winter road maintenance \nalong local roads. In conjunction with its rural road rehabilitation project, the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will review PBC performance in \n2007. The Government has been keenly pursuing cost-effective pavement \ninterventions. \n \n(iii)  Systematic project prioritization. Although the Highway Development and \nManagement  Model  4  (HDM4)  was  introduced  for  the  road  asset \nmanagement system, traffic data were generally a few years old and only \nvery brief economic and social assessments were conducted. In 2005, to \novercome the traffic data deficiency problem, the Armenian Roads Directorate \nNon-Commercial  State  Organization  (ARD)  introduced  automatic  traffic \ncounters  at  10  locations  along  the  six  main  highways,  which  feed  traffic \ninformation to the current road management system. A more comprehensive \nroad project selection and monitoring system needs to be further developed \nto reduce the cost of maintaining the road assets by the systematic use of \neconomic analysis as a basis for selecting the most appropriate time and type \nof  road  maintenance,  the  use  of  improved  road  technology,  and  timely \nmaintenance interventions commensurate to the available resources.  \n \n(iv)  Enhancement of the monitoring capacity. A new system mentioned above \nneeds to include specific monitoring functions with respect to traffic counts \nand periodic road condition surveys over the road network, safety measures \nto minimize accidents, and social and environmental measures to minimize \nrisks associated with road improvements. \n \nB.  Long-Term Road Subsector Policy (2006\u20132015) \n \n2.  To  respond  to  the  challenges  created  by  the  road  infrastructure  deficiency,  the \nGovernment  has  adopted  a  main  road  subsector  policy  until  2015,  focusing  on  the \nrehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper (PRSP).  \n \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2  \nC.  Three Overall Long-Term Road Subsector Strategic Goals \n \n3.  The  Government  adopted  three  strategic  goals  for  its  road  infrastructure \ndevelopment for the period 2006\u20132015: (i) maintenance and improvement of the main road \nnetwork  to  enhance  the  country\u2019s  business  competitiveness  and  support  the  economy \nthrough  reduction  in  transport  costs  and  increase  in  interregional  transit  traffic; \n(ii) improvement of the socioeconomic condition of the rural population through rehabilitation \nof rural roads in support of the PRSP; and (iii) improvement of road safety. The Government \nhas planned to (i) complete the rehabilitation of old bridges and other ancillary facilities along \nthe main highways by 2010, (ii) complete the rehabilitation of secondary roads and bridges \nby 2015,  (iii) meet rural road transport demands in a cost-effective manner, and (iv) ensure \nroad safety throughout all road categories. The strategic goals for the road subsector and \nthe goals of ARD are in Table A2.1. \n \nTable A2.1: Strategic Goals for the Road Subsector and the Goals of ARD \n \nStrategic Goal  ARD\u2019s Goals  Performance Indicators \nMaintenance and  Develop an efficient  Ratio (total length with \nimprovement of the main  maintenance system that will  satisfactory maintenance/ \nroad network to enhance  ensure sustainable operation  total road length) \nthe country\u2019s business  and maintenance of the road \ncompetitiveness and  assets \nsupport the economy  Improve the road surface of  IRI (m/km) \nthrough reduction in  the main highways \ntransport costs and  Rehabilitate secondary roads IRI (m/km) \nincrease in interregional \ntransit traffic \nImprovement of the  Improve transport activities  Ratio (total number of \nsocioeconomic condition of  between regional centers  communities with sufficient \nthe rural population through  and communities  feeder roads to the regional \nrehabilitation of rural roads  centers and the total \nin support of the PRSP  number of the communities)\nRehabilitate rural roads  IRI (m/km) \nRehabilitate ancillary  Number of bridges in a \nfacilities along rural roads  good condition \nImprovement of road safety  Identity blind spots and  Total number of accidents \ninstall road signs and  Ratio (total number of road \nmarkings  signs against total number \nof road sign requirements) \nRatio (total length of \nmarkings against the total \nlength of markings \nrequired) \n IRI = international roughness index, km = kilometer, m = meter, PRSP = Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. \nSource: Republic of Armenia. 2005. Decision on Endorsement of the 2006\u20132008 Three-Year Development and \n2006 Rehabilitation and Maintenance Annual Work Plan of the Commonly Used State Roads of the Republic of \nArmenia. Yerevan. (Decision No. 2412-N).  \n \nD.  Six Strategic Goals for Road Asset Management (2006\u20132008) \n \n4.  The goals are to do the following. \n \n(i)  Develop the overall road network, taking people\u2019s transport needs, economic \ndevelopment prospects, transport demand development, and road safety into \nconsideration. ", "Appendix 2  25\n(ii)  Reduce transport costs and achieve speedy transport. \n(iii)  Provide rural communities with all-weather access throughout the year, while \nminimizing negative environmental impacts. \n(iv)  Improve road asset management. \n(v)  Improve the quality of roads through the introduction of new technologies and \nmaterials and further development of the domestic construction industry. \n(vi)  Create more job opportunities in the road construction industry. \n5.  The Road Improvement Plan for 2006\u20132008 includes (i) main highway rehabilitation \n(150  km),  (ii)  secondary  road  rehabilitation  (340  km),  and  (iii)  rural  road  rehabilitation \n(335 km). \n \nE.  Network and Traffic \n \n6.  The interstate (main) network of 1,561 km connects all regions (11 regions including \nYerevan) and provides international links. The total of 1,832 km of republican (secondary) \nroads connects district centers, and 4,122 km of local roads provide access for the rural \npopulation. About 1,000 km of local roads are under the responsibility of regional authorities \nor local communities, the remainder being under state responsibility. Daily traffic volume on \ninterstate roads ranges from 1,000 vehicles to 25,000 vehicles. Magisterial roads (M-roads) \nleading to Georgia in the north and Iran in the south are part of the international corridors. \nThe axle load limit is 11.5 tons on interstate roads and 10.0 tons on all other roads. \n \n7.  After  independence,  expenditure  on  roads  virtually  ceased  and  even  essential \nmaintenance was not carried out due to the economic difficulties. The PRSP states that the \nmain component of the road program up to 2015 should be rehabilitation and maintenance \nof the existing network, with particular attention to bridges in poor condition. Rehabilitation \nand maintenance has been largely financed through external sources. Some 1,400 km of \nprimary  roads  and  dozens  of  bridges  were  rehabilitated  in  1995\u20132004;  the  average \ninternational roughness index on these roads fell from 7.8 to 3.5 over the period.  \n \n8.  The primary road network is well developed\u2014the interstate network (main highways) \nis fully paved while about 90% of republican roads (secondary roads) are paved. ARD \nestimates the interstate/republican surface condition to be 15% good, 75% fair, and 10% \nbad.

Road Funding \n \n9.  Much  of  road  sector  funding  has  been  from  international  sources\u2014the  Lincy \nFoundation, World Bank, and Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). In 2005, for the first \ntime, a 3-year maintenance program was adopted for 2006\u20132008. In 2007, AMD16.16 billion \n(around $50 million equivalent), which is 0.6% of the GDP, has been allocated for operation \nand  maintenance  of  the  road  network.  The  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework for 2007\u20132009 envisages increasing allocations to operation and maintenance. \nPresently, provision for domestic funding has been made through legislation, requiring 10% \nof fuel tax revenue to be applied to routine maintenance.  \n ", "Appendix 2  27\n10.  In  2005\u20132008,  ARD  introduced  performance-based  contracts  (PBCs)  for \nmaintenance operations on a few main and secondary roads on a pilot basis. If successful, \nsuch contracts will be applied more widely. Under the MCC project, technical assistance \n(TA) in 2007 will review PBCs\u2019 performance to date. \n \nG.  Lifeline Road Network Program \n \n11.  The 2,702 km of the Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP) includes road lengths \nranging from 1 km to 32 km, with daily traffic volumes between 50 and 2,500. One third of \nthe length is republican road, and two thirds are local and community roads. About 60% is \nasphalt or bitumen surface. Proposed improvement levels were based on traffic volume. \nImprovement of culverts, bridges, retaining walls, and drainage is a key component.  \n \n12.  Implementation of the LRNP was estimated by the World Bank in 2004 to cost \n$135 million (for the improvement of 2,677 km, with 25 km needing no action). Table A2.3 \nprovides a broad estimate of the cost of completion at May 2007 prices. Total financing of \nabout $98 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and MCC is expect to cover \nmore than 40% of the total length (about 2,700 km).1 The Government is expected to \ncomplete the rehabilitation of roads totaling more than 532 km. The balance will be 978 km \nand could be completed for about $153 million, including financing from the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) in the amount of about $50 million equivalent. \n \nTable A2.3: Lifeline Road Network Program Cost to Completion \n(May 2007 Prices) \n \nItem  ADB  MCC  Government Balance  Total \nInterstate (Main) (km)  25  0  0  0  0 \nRepublican (Secondary) (km)  78  321  196  122  759 \nLocal (km)  120  622  336  856  1,918 \nTotal  223  943  532  978  2,677 \nAverage Cost ($'000/km)  131  71  94  153  112 \nBase Cost ($ million)  29.2  67.0  50.0  146.5  300.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, MCC = Millennium Challenge Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nH.  Road Safety \n \n13.  Some progress has been made with the establishment of the National Road Safety \nCouncil, and the development of a road safety program that identifies accident black spots. \nHowever, the World Bank2 notes that the situation is serious and deteriorating. It defines a \nshort-,  medium-,  and  long-term  safety  strategy,  together  with  a  short-term  action  and \ninvestment plan.  \n \n14.  Table A2.4 shows 2005 to have been an unfortunate year with fatalities about 20% \nhigher than in 2004. The death rate per 10,000 vehicles is eight times as high as in the \nsafest European countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities. \nA number of steps could improve matters\u2014wearing seat belts, not using mobile phones \nwhile driving, and more regard for pedestrian priority. A three-stage process is required: \n(i) publicity campaigns to change behavior; (ii) police warning of offenders; and (iii) staged \n                                                 \n1  According to information provided by SWECO International, a consulting firm engaged for the feasibility study \nand design for the roads of the MCC\u2019s rural road rehabilitation project, the average road rehabilitation cost is \nestimated at $137,000/km at prices prevailing in May 2007.  \n2  World  Bank.  2006.

Within  5  years,  with  road  network  condition  in  general  returned  to  a  fair  state, \nincentives should be introduced to accelerate the replacement of the oldest vehicles. This \nwould improve fuel consumption, reduce pollution, improve safety, and increase network \ncapacity. Old vehicles have poor acceleration and hill climbing capabilities, delaying other \nvehicles. Annual testing of older vehicles against increasingly strict criteria, with possibly a \ntrade-in bonus for scrapping, would yield large economic benefits.      \n \nTable A2.4: Road Accidents 2001\u20132005 \n \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n           \nIncidence  1,021  1,002  1,025  1,164  1,312 \nDeaths  237  235  252  259  310 \nInjuries  1,258  1,213  1,294  1,492  1,774 \n     Source: National Road Safety Council.

Resolving the financing issue is critical to ensure (i) appropriate road infrastructure \nservice levels for cost-effective and safe transport, (ii) sufficient maintenance to sustain the \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  pavement  strengthening  as  required  for  increased  traffic  levels,  and \n(iv) infrastructure improvement to meet traffic capacity needs cost-effectively. Maintenance \nshould  be  given  priority  because  of  its  much  higher  economic  return,  with  increasing \nimportance given to environmental and social dimensions. An enabling environment for \nprivate sector participation and state capacity to plan and contract with the private sector is \nparticularly important. A sustainable set of road user charges, and adoption of improved \ntechnologies and strong maintenance management are also required to respond to growing \ndemands for road transport. \n \n17.  Given  immediate  road  subsector  needs,  long-term  planning  and  database \ndevelopment have not been priorities. Information on traffic growth rates and vehicle fleet \ndevelopment is not readily available. Now is an appropriate time to develop a medium-/long- \nterm network needs assessment, in support of economic and social development goals. This \nneeds to be based on a range of economic growth and regional development scenarios, \nsupported by an improved traffic flow database, particularly concerning seasonal variation \nand peak period traffic volumes. ", "Appendix 3  29\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \n \n1.  The Lincy Foundation, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of the United States, \nand World Bank are the major external financing sources for the road subsector in Armenia\u2014\nproviding the road subsector with a total of nearly $216 million since 1995. \n \n2.  The Lincy Foundation, established by the Armenian diaspora in the US, has provided \ntwo grants totaling $86.9 million for the road subsector: (i) $73.4 million for rehabilitation of \n435 kilometers  (km)  of  main  highways  and  secondary  roads  during  2001\u20132003,  and \n(ii) $13.5 million for rehabilitation of 22.3 km of streets in the capital city during 2002\u20132003. It \nhas planned to provide $16 million to improve 87.4 km of secondary roads during 2006\u20132008 \nand $20.9 million for rehabilitation of streets in the capital city totaling 7.5 km during 2004\u20132008. \nTotal financing would total $123.8 million during 2001\u20132008. As part of its assistance, the Lincy \nFoundation improved the road access of the Noyemberyan area in the Tavush region located in \nnortheastern Armenia. The United States Agency for International Development1 reported that \nthe  agricultural  potential  of  the  Noyemberyan  area  has  been  developed,  and  export  of \nagriculture produce and processed agriculture products is taking place from this area to the \nRussian Federation and Georgia. \n \n3.  The US, through MCC, signed a millennium challenge compact with the Government of \nArmenia (the Government) in March 2006. In September 2006, the 5-year rural development \nprogram totaling $235 million on a grant basis was officially inaugurated. The program includes \n(i) a rural road rehabilitation project ($67 million) that will improve up to 943 km of rural roads \nidentified for the Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP), and (ii) an irrigated agriculture project \n($146 million). The rural road rehabilitation project and the irrigated agriculture project cover all \nregions except the capital city (10 regions). \n    \n4.  During 1995\u20132004, the World Bank financed two loans for road improvement, including \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  Armenian  Roads  Directorate  Non-Commercial  State \nOrganization (ARD), a road safety program, and institutional support to the Ministry of Transport \nand Communications, totaling about $62 million to the road subsector. In 1997, the World Bank \ncommissioned a transport sector review.2 The World Bank is actively supporting a road safety \nprogram in Armenia and is considering a loan (about $10 million) to finance the proposed traffic \nmanagement  and  safety  project,  focusing  on  Yerevan.  A  traffic  management  study  and \npassenger transport study will be attached to the loan. \n \n5.  The Government of Japan (Japan) has provided Armenia with a study and technical \ncooperation project (totaling about $3 million) to finance a landslide survey through the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA). In 2002, Japan provided a grant (about $5 million \nequivalent) in 2002 to finance road construction equipment for the capital city. Since then, the \nequipment has been used extensively to maintain the road network within the capital city. \n \n6.  Japan Bank for International Cooperation is preparing a loan of $50 million equivalent for \nthe LRNP in parallel with the Project by using the same subproject selection criteria developed \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n7.  The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP) is preparing a pre-feasibility study on the southernmost part of the international \ntransport corridor between Goris and Kapan (totaling about 60 km).  \n                                                 \n1  Consultation meeting with the executive director of the Armenia Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Market \nDevelopment Project held on 15 May 2007. \n2  World Bank. 1997.

All subprojects must comply with Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies and guidance, \nand satisfy ADB\u2019s procedures for subproject preparation, including the technical, operational, \nenvironmental,  social,  and  resettlement  dimensions.  In  respect  to  the  sample  subprojects \nreviewed  under  the  small-scale  technical  assistance,  these  requirements  were  met  during \nproject  preparation.  For  additional  subprojects,  the  requirement  will  be  met  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n3.  Before starting procurement actions for the additional subprojects for inclusion in the \nsecond annual batch, the Armenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization \n(ARD), the Implementing Agency, will submit to ADB for approval, a report providing details of \ncompliance with the selection criteria (para. 1) of each newly proposed subproject in the batch. \nThe approval process for each batch of additional subprojects will be as follows:  \n \n(i)  with the assistance of subproject preparation and project supervision consultants, \nARD prepares a consolidated report indicating the compliance of each proposed \nsubproject with the selection criteria, including an overall IEE for all subprojects, \nwhich  will  focus  on  any  environmental  problems  identified  and  mitigation \nrequired,  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment,  RP  (if  necessary),  and \nIDPRDP (if necessary) for each subproject; \n \n(ii)  ARD screens the subprojects included in the report and refines the report, as \nnecessary,  to  meet  ADB  requirements;  and  prepares  a  summary  checklist \ndescribing the eligibility, preparation status, and safeguard compliance of each \nsubproject;  \n \n(iii)  ARD submits the report and checklist to ADB for approval; \n \n(iv)  ADB approves the proposed subprojects, subject to any further modifications \nrequired, if ADB considers such modifications are necessary; and \n \n(v)  subject  to  addressing  any  modifications,  as  required,  ARD  proceeds  with \nprocurement for subprojects approved by ADB.  \n \nC.

Economic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) and the economic net present value (NPV) (at a discount rate of 12%) were \ncalculated  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios  for  a  20-year  period  of \noperation. For the without-project case, a continued worsening of surface condition is calculated \nwithin the Highway Development and Management Model 4 (HDM4) down to the standard \nmaximum IRI values by pavement type. Without the Project, the deteriorated state of the roads \nwill result in continued high transport costs for the towns/villages and rural areas they serve, \nproviding a disincentive to marketing of local produce, communication with other areas, and use \nof newer vehicles. With the Project and other associated rural road projects, the accessibility of \nrural areas will be transformed, providing all-weather access, much faster travel, and lower \noperating costs. Economic benefits accrue in the form of lower vehicle operating costs and road \nuser time savings. Appropriate seasonal adjustments were made to the traffic counts, based on \nan assessment of the local situations. \n9.  The economic cost of the Project comprises the resource cost of physical construction \nand of an overlay, where required, during the analysis period. There is no land acquisition cost, \nas all work will be within the existing right-of-way. The total economic cost for 222.8 km is \nestimated at $29.2 million by excluding the value-added tax.

The average traffic composition on the \nproject roads is 81.1% cars, 11.8% buses, and 7.1% trucks. Vehicle owners will be the largest \nbeneficiary group, but passenger and freight users are expected to gain considerable benefits, \ngiven the existing poor quality of the roads and the increase in speed and avoidance of damage \nto  cargo  (especially  agriculture  produce)  after  improvement.  The  proportion  of the  poor  in \npassengers is assumed to be the average for the regions. In rural areas, many poor owners of \nold vehicles will benefit and 20% are estimated to be very poor. There are also many poor \nfarmers amongst freight users\u201425% are assumed to be poor, based on the results of poverty \nassessments conducted during project processing.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Armenia: \nIn Armenia, 1.2 million people (about 38% of the total population) live in rural areas, of which more than 45% are poor. \nPoverty has been reduced from 50.0% in 2000 to 29.8% in 2005. However, there has been a slower pace of poverty \nreduction  in  rural  areas.  This  is  mainly  because  of  constrained  economic  activities\u2014primarily  attributable  to \nmountainous topography and poor transport infrastructure\u2014imposing high direct and indirect transport costs on the \nrural population.  \n \nRural infrastructure development is the cornerstone of the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It \nhas prepared rural infrastructure investment programs with the main purpose of reducing rural poverty. In the road \nsector, it developed a Lifeline Road Network Program (LRNP) with assistance from the World Bank in 2004 that will \nimprove the access of rural communities to the national highway system in an optimal manner. The LRNP targets 784 \nhigh priority rural roads (secondary and local roads) totaling about 2,700 kilometers (km). Under the small-scale \ntechnical assistance for preparing the Rural Road Sector Project (the Project), the overall cost of the LRNP was \npreliminarily estimated at $300 million. \n \nIn 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of the United States signed an agreement with the Government \nto finance the rehabilitation of rural roads totaling about 943 km of the LLNP, with grant financing of about $67 million, \nwhile the Government has planned to rehabilitate rural roads adding up to about 532 km. In parallel, the Government \nhas requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider financing the rehabilitation of high priority rural roads \ntotaling about 220 km in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik regions. The Project is in line with the PRSP. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention  \n                                                                                                 (geographic poverty) \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project is located in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik regions with a total population of nearly 1 million. \nRoughly 54% of the total rural population in Armenia lives in these four regions and about 61% (about 650,000) of the \ntotal population in the four regions live in rural areas. The incidence of poverty ranges from 30.9% to 34.5%, against \nthe national average of 29.8% in 2005.  \n \nPoor road infrastructure has also led to economic losses and limited access to basic services. According to the World \na\nBank,  about 40% of total survey participants replied that significant volumes of agriculture produce were lost during \ntransportation, 18% responded that 40% was lost, and 24% stated that 30% was lost. \n \nPoor road conditions in rural areas have constrained timely access to health and other social services, and access to \nschools and time spent on education. Bus services and/or road freight services in some rural areas have been \nreduced or stopped because operators try to avoid damages to their vehicles or perceive high costs of driving on very \npoor/poor roads. \n \nThe Project will rehabilitate high priority rural roads totaling about 220 km in Ararat, Armavir, Kotayk, and Gegharkunik \nregions, serving 71 communities with a total population of 127,000 (about 10% of the total rural population). It will \nimprove the access of these communities to (i) the capital city and regional center through the main road network; and \n(ii) social service delivery institutions, markets, collection points for agriculture produce and diary products, agro-\nprocessing centers, and industrial processing areas. As a result, the Project will be able to offer communities new \nopportunities for industrial, agricultural (including small- and medium-sized agro\u2013processing industries), and service \nsectors. The Project has been developed in close partnerships with the road program and agriculture programs being \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nfinanced by MCC, Armenian Social Investment Fund (ASIF),b Armenian Small- and Medium-sized Enterprise Market \nDevelopment Project financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), National Program \non the Response to HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) being implemented by the Government with assistance from the Joint \nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and UNDP\u2019s programs on anti-human trafficking. \n \nThe Project\u2019s impact on poverty has been quantified by examining the share of total project net benefits that would \naccrue to the poor and the very poor. A distribution analysis conducted during project preparation indicates that the \nProject will yield a poverty impact ratio of 0.28. The high poverty impact ratio reflects a high incidence of poverty \namong direct beneficiaries and a substantial net transfer of resources from the economy as a whole to the project \nareas. Total net benefits accruing to the poor amount to about $24 million, of which the very poor will receive about $4 \nmillion. Some 32% of road users within the project areas are poor and 6% are classified very poor. Project benefits will \naccrue to about 40,500 poor beneficiaries, of whom roughly 7,000 are very poor. \n \nThe Project will target four regions where poverty incidence is worse than the national average. Thus, the Project is \nclassified a geographically targeted intervention. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nAs part of the project preparation, more than 15 consultations (covering both social and environmental aspects) were \nheld with stakeholders, including directly affected people, representatives of local governments and the Council of \nElderly, key persons in the communities. Issues and activities related to project implementation were discussed and \nconcerns (especially road safety and increased exposure to communicable diseases and human trafficking) have \nbeen integrated in the project design. Stakeholder consultation and participation will continue throughout project \nimplementation. Armenian Roads Directorate Non-Commercial State Organization (ARD), the Implementing Agency, \nwill ensure that the Project is implemented with the active participation of all stakeholders, using participatory \npractices. \n \nConsultations (social aspects) with key players in the country and road sector development as well as communities \nwithin the project areas were conducted during project preparation. Literature reviews on social and poverty analysis \nof the poverty situation in the project regions were also conducted. The key players involved in the consultations were \nthe World Bank, MCC, Lincy Foundation, ASIF, PRSP secretariat, UNAIDS, and UNDP. \n \nSix consultations (social aspects) were held with representatives of local government and the Council of Elderly \n(Avagani); key persons in the communities (school principals, teachers, and agronomists); and community members in \nthe project areas (Varnenis in the Gegharkunik region; Barzdrashen and Arevshat in the Ararat region; and Numus, \nDzoraghbiur, and Mayakovsky in the Kotayk region). \n \nAll stakeholders and project beneficiaries welcomed the initiatives and considered that the Project will have a \nsignificant positive impact on rural development. First, they consider that the roads are extremely important for \nagricultural activities, agro-processing business, and any other business in the communities. People also mentioned \nthat the delivery of agricultural produce to domestic and international markets and the procurement of inputs for \nagricultural activities and agro-processing business will be more efficient with good roads. Improved rural road \ninfrastructure will also reduce the transportation costs and damages to agriculture produce. As a result, prices of \ngoods are expected to reduce and volumes of agriculture produce for sales will increase. The consultations have \nconcluded that the Project will support improvement of the income-related Millennium Development Goals. Secondly, \nimproved road infrastructure is an important component of social development and of the quality of rural life because it \nprovides rural communities with enhanced access to social service delivery institutions including hospitals, clinics, and \nschools. The consultations have concluded that the Project will support improvement of the non income-related \nMillennium Development Goals.  \n \nIn accordance with the Government\u2019s requirements for externally funded projects,c  a project governing council (PGC) \nwill be established. The PGC will provide overall oversight and supervision for the Project. It comprises 11 members: \n(i) minister of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), (ii) first deputy minister of MOTC, (iii) first \ndeputy  minister  of  finance  and  economy,  (iv)  first  deputy  minister  of  justice,  (v)  deputy  minister  of  territorial \nadministration, (v) five representatives from civil society, and (vi) head of the project management unit (PMU).   ", "Appendix 11  49\n \nPGC meetings will be held at least quarterly, and the PMU will report and seek guidance from the PGC on major \nprocurement issues and policy decisions. The PGC will provide a forum for coordinating activities among project \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen accounted for 53.8% of the total project survey respondents. The overall poverty rate for the project regions \nwas 33.3%; 29.7% of women are poor. The extreme poverty rate for the project regions was 5.8%; 4.6% of the women \nare very poor. Therefore, women are slightly better off than the overall population in the project regions. The majority \nof women in the project areas are engaged in agriculture activities or small- and medium-sized agro-industries \n(including cottage agro-industries). Reduced travel time and more available transport services will help improve the \nlives of women and children, as improved road transport under the Project will enhance their access to the nearest \nmarkets and social service delivery institutions (such as schools, hospitals, and clinics) and increased employment \nopportunities. It is anticipated that greater road connectivity may have a direct and positive impact on less educated \ngirls and women by promoting their access to more education and training opportunities.  \n \nDuring the project surveys, women considered that the roads are extremely important for agricultural activities, agro-\nprocessing business, and any other business in the communities. Secondly, they considered that improved road \ninfrastructure is an important component of social development and of the quality of rural life because it provides rural \ncommunities with enhanced access to social service delivery institutions including hospitals, clinics, and schools.  \n \nOther concerns are that the Project will increase the potential of the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually \ntransmitted infections because of the influx of construction workers and increased transport facilitation caused by the \nroad improvements. Human trafficking of teenage girls and women is an additional risk related to increased road \nconnectivity. These risks will be minimized and mitigated by maintaining close coordination and regular consultations \nwith the National Program on the Response to HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) being implemented by the Government with \nassistance from UNAIDS and UNDP\u2019s programs on anti-human trafficking to raise awareness and provide preventive \nmeasures for local communities (with a special focus on women), construction workers, and mobile population. \nAppropriate actions will be taken, if necessary. \n \nIn general, women as well as the remaining community members within the project areas will benefit from the Project. \nThus, a specific gender strategy has not been prepared.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The \nProject will provide the IDPRs with improved access to \nmarkets, job opportunities, and basic social services. The \nIDPRs do not live near the road alignments, so there will \nbe no negative impact on them during construction. Thus, \nthe surveys have concluded that negative impacts on the \nIDPRs  are  found  to  be  very  limited.  The  IDPR \ndevelopment framework has been prepared, as ADB\u2019s \nsector  lending  modality  is  adopted  for  the  Project. \nConsulting services for subproject preparation and project \nsupervision  will  review  potential  negative  impacts  on \nIDPRs, and prepare specific actions and development \nplans for them, if necessary. \n \n   Significant  Increased Exposure to Communicable Diseases and   \n  Human Trafficking   Yes \n Not significant     \nThere is a risk of increasing the infection rate of HIV/AIDS \n    No  \nduring  the  construction  stage,  when  increases  in \n None \nconstruction trucks and equipment are expected. There is \nalso a risk that lack of awareness of HIV/AIDS among \nconstruction workers and communities may make people \nliving in the project areas (especially the poor, very poor, \nand IDPRs) vulnerable. Human trafficking of teenage girls \nand  women  is  another  related  to  increased  road \nconnectivity. These risks will be minimized and mitigated \nby  maintaining  close  coordination  and  regular \nconsultations with the National Program on the Response \nto HIV Epidemic (2007\u20132011) being implemented by the \nGovernment with assistance from UNAIDS (including the \nfour  project  regions),  and  UNDP\u2019s  programs  on  anti-\nhuman  trafficking  to  raise  awareness  and  provide \npreventive measures for local communities (with a special \nfocus  on  women),  construction  workers,  and  mobile \npopulations.
