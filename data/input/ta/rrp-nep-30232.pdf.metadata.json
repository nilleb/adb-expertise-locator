An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \nAssessment  and the summary is a supplementary appendix. \n    \nProject Description  The Project will address the development needs of conflict-affected \ncommunities by promoting inclusive processes that seek to restore \nincomes and connect the rural poor, and those that have been \ntraditionally excluded from the development process, to markets \nand  economic  opportunities  through  investments  in  rural \ninfrastructure and livelihood restoration facilities. The Project will \nextend  the  network  of  improved  rural  transport  infrastructure, \nconsisting  of  roads,  trails,  and  pedestrian  bridges. \nThe  Project  will  also  invest  in  small,  community  socioeconomic \ninfrastructure,  and  provide  jobs,  empower  conflict-affected  rural \ncommunities for development, increase institutional capacity, and \nimprove  accountability  and  transparency.  Labor-based, \nenvironmentally friendly, and participatory approaches will ensure \nthat  the  investment  in  construction  and  rehabilitation  of \ninfrastructure results in sustainable, improved access to economic \nand social services, and enhanced social and financial capital. The \nProject will improve the livelihoods of people in the project areas, \nparticularly the poor, who constitute about 70% of the population in \nthe subproject areas. The Project will be located in 18 districts, \nincluding 14 districts in the Western, Midwestern, and Far Western, \nregions that are among the poorest in the country and most \naffected by the conflict. The districts have been selected on the \nbasis of their high incidence and intensity of poverty, need to \naddress causes of the conflict, need for improved access and \nenhanced  livelihoods,  and  implementation  manageability \nconsiderations.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  building \ncapacity at the national level and in the project area. \n   ", "i v \nRationale  The  Project  supports  the  poverty  reduction  objectives  and \ndevelopment policies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe Government, enunciated in its poverty reduction strategy. The \nGovernment  regards  this  as  a  flagship  project  that  addresses \ndevelopment  challenges  posed  by  the  conflict  and  that  will \ncontribute to the operational strategies for poverty reduction in the \nGovernment's Tenth Five-Year Plan. The Project also addresses \ntwo key causes of slow agricultural growth and limited rural jobs, \nincluding  (i)  lack  of  an  effective  and  properly  maintained  rural \ntransportation  network;  and  (ii)  weak  institutions,  constrained \ngovernment service delivery, and lack of beneficiary participation. \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  the  livelihood  opportunities  of \ncommunities seriously affected by the conflict, and particularly of \nsocially excluded groups. \n \nObjective  The project goal is to reduce rural poverty in 18 very poor remote \nhill and mountain districts affected by the conflict. The purpose is \nto achieve sustainable increased access to economic and social \nservices, and enhanced social and financial capital for people in \nthe project area, particularly poor and disadvantaged groups. \n \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $62.3  million  equivalent, \ncomprising foreign exchange of $5.3 million, and local currency of \n$57.0 million equivalent. Component investments cover community \ndevelopment and rural livelihood restoration, capacity building and \ndecentralized governance, rural transport infrastructure, and project \nmanagement services. \n   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)a \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \n  ADB  5.3  34.7  40.0  64 \n  SDC  0.0  1.9  1.9  3 \n  GTZ  0.0  0.7  0.7  1 \n  Government           0.0  14.7  14.7  24 \n  Local Government        0.0  4.2  4.2  7 \n  Beneficiaries        0.0  0.8  0.8  1 \n \n Total  5.3  57.0  62.3  100 \n  ADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GTZ  =  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit, SDC = Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. \n  a Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed financing from ADB's Special Funds resources is \nequivalent  in  various  currencies  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n27,328,000 ($40 million). The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   ", "  v\nPeriod of Utilization  Until 29 February 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 August 2011  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural \nRoads (DOLIDAR) \n \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Local  Development  has  reconstituted  existing \nArrangements  steering committees to form a joint project steering committee for all \ndevelopment  partners\u2019  rural  transport  projects,  in  an  integrated \nsector-wide  approach.  DOLIDAR  has  established  a  project \ncoordination  unit  (PCU)  in  Kathmandu,  headed  by  a  project \ncoordinator  to  coordinate  all  project  activities.  The  PCU  will  be \nresponsible  for  guiding  and  monitoring  district  development \ncommittees (DDCs) as they implement project components. At the \ndistrict level, project implementation will be the responsibility of the \ndistrict project office (DPO) within the district technical office of each \nDDC. A local engineering consultant to cover technical issues, and \na  local  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  engaged  for  social \nmobilization and support for rural infrastructure building groups will \nsupport  the  DPO.  A  working-level  implementation  coordination \ncommittee will be established to guide the PCU.  \n \nProcurement  Goods, related services, and civil works financed by ADB will be \nprocured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  All  civil \nworks  will  be  small  and  widely  dispersed,  and  most  will  be \nundertaken by unskilled community labor. The works will be small, \nwith an average value of $10,000\u2013$15,000 equivalent, and follow \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  community  participation in procurement. In \nisolated  instances,  small  civil-works  contracts  may  be  required, \nwhich DPOs will procure on the basis of local competitive bidding \namong  contractors  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  The PCU will select the central implementation support consultants. \nDistrict  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  by  the  DPOs  in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and \nits  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. Quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  will  be  used  to  recruit  consultants.  ADB  approved \nadvance action for government recruitment of consultants. \n   ", "v i \nProject Benefits and  The  Project\u2019s  economic  impacts  include  increased  economic \nBeneficiaries  growth and jobs in the project area. Farmers living within the \ninfluence area of rural transport infrastructure subprojects will \nbenefit from better access to markets, sources of production inputs, \nand extension services. Transport costs and time to procure inputs \nand market surpluses will be reduced. With better market access \nfarmers  will  be  able  to  consider  expanding  production  and \ncultivating high-value crops. Productive agriculture, reduced travel \ncosts, and improved access to services for subproject beneficiaries \nwill create on- and off-farm rural jobs. The Project will also generate \nsignificant,  but  not  easily  quantifiable,  benefits,  including \nconstruction  jobs  for  local  poor  people,  capacity  building, \nimprovements  in  livelihoods,  and  increased  use  by  rural \ncommunities of health and educational services. \n \n  Approximately 2.5 million people live in the selected districts, 1.5 \nmillion below the poverty line. About 800,000\u20131,200,00 people, \n65% (520,000\u2013780,000) or more of whom are poor, will directly \nbenefit  from  rural  infrastructure  investments.  Of  poor \nbeneficiaries,  about  25%  (130,000\u2013195,000)  are  from \ndisadvantaged castes. About 780,000 poor people will directly \nbenefit through increased wage income of around 25% during \nthe subproject and supplementary investment construction, and \n200,000 people will be lifted out of poverty. Employment totaling \n34,700 person-years is expected to be created by the project \ninfrastructure investments.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  armed  conflict  and  instability  represent  a  project  risk.  The \nproject districts include those that are active sites for conflict. In \ngeneral, the experience of development partners working in conflict \nareas is that the insurgents have not hindered rural infrastructure \nproject  implementation,  since  rural  communities  attach  a  high \npriority to improving livelihoods and rural access. The Project will \nseek to work gradually through local people with the assistance of \nlocal NGOs, and emphasize transparency and flexibility. Achieving \ntangible benefits for communities as quickly as possible is also an \nimportant success factor in working in conflict areas. Based on the \nexperience  of  other  ongoing  projects,  implementing  rural \ninfrastructure and livelihood projects is possible in conflict areas if \nthe above approaches are taken. ", "  vii\n  A risk associated with achieving the intended long-term benefits \nfrom improved rural transport infrastructure is that the roads will \nnot  be  maintained  in  good  condition.  During  project \nimplementation the risk is that DDCs may not be able to mobilize \nsufficient  resources  to  maintain  project-financed  and  other \nmotorable  links  in  rural  road  networks.  The  project  design \nmitigates this risk by providing financing support and by setting \ntargets to be achieved by the districts at different stages during \nimplementation,  which  will  be  monitored  to  assess  DDCs\u2019 \nperformance. This approach will be supported by measures to \ncreate  a  maintenance  culture  in  the  project  districts,  and  to \nestablish local capacity for planned maintenance. In the long term \nthe risks are that measures already proposed by the Government \nfor sustainable financing of rural road maintenance, from central \nand local resources, will not be put in place nationwide, and that \nDDCs will revert to investing limited funds in new roads rather \nthan  maintaining  the  network.  The  first  risk  will  be  addressed \nthrough  continuing  policy  dialogue  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment.  The  proposed  institutional  development  technical \nassistance (TA) will help address the second risk by strengthening \nDOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  maintenance  management \nguidance  and  direction  to  DDCs,  and  to  monitor  rural  road \nmaintenance performance nationwide. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Institutional  development  TA  will  also  be  provided  for  capacity \nbuilding  of  DOLIDAR,  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding  program.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  development  in \nDOLIDAR in a number of key complementary areas, but with a \nsector perspective. The TA will also continue to develop national \npolicies and strategies that previous ADB technical assistance has \nsupported, particularly to further decentralization. \n ", "   \n \nix\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Nepal for the Decentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project.1 The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  in  Rural \nInfrastructure  Institutions,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  With poverty incidence estimated at 38%, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the \nworld. Poverty is concentrated in rural areas where its incidence (44%) is almost double that in \nurban areas (23%). The incidence of poverty in the Midwestern and Far Western regions (72%) \nand in the mountain districts (56%) is much greater than the national average. The hill and \nmountain  districts  of  the  Midwestern  and  Far  Western  regions  rank  the  lowest  in  terms  of \nsocioeconomic and infrastructure development. They have substantially lower livelihood indicators \nand road densities than other areas of Nepal, and limited market access worsens their poverty. \nDisadvantaged ethnic groups and castes in these districts are among the poorest people in the \ncountry, with human development indicators significantly lower than those for other caste groups. \nSuch deprivation, inequality, and discrimination have contributed to the spread of the conflict in \nNepal.  \n \n3.  The development of the strategic road network (SRN)2 has long been a government priority, \nresulting  in  around  3,000  kilometers  (km)  of  national  highways  providing  the  main  strategic \nconnections nationwide, and nearly 2,000 km of feeder roads connecting highways to regional and \ndistrict headquarters and to major economic centers. Within about 2 years all but five of the hill and \nmountain district centers should be connected to the SRN. Nepal has an estimated 6,600 km of \ndistrict roads, most of which are earthen. The Department of Local Infrastructure Development and \nAgricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) has estimated that the country has 14,000 km of rural roads (in \ndistricts and villages), but over 25% are officially listed as not motorable. About 130,000 km of main \ntrails and at least 900 pedestrian suspension bridges are estimated to exist. Most people in remote \nhill and mountain districts live more than a day\u2019s walk from a road, and overall poverty increases with \npoorer physical access. A number of districts have no roads at all, and in most districts road density \nis 0.5\u20131.7 km per 100 square km, and 0.9\u20132.7 km per 10,000 people. Only districts with feeder \nroads have substantially higher figures. These data compare poorly with Ninth Five-Year Plan \ntargets of 8 km and 4 km, respectively.3  \n \n4.  While considerable efforts have been made in the past decade to strengthen maintenance \ncapacity for the SRN, maintenance systems for rural roads are poorly developed. The Government \nhas created an independent Road Board with a road maintenance fund. About 30% of the fund\u2019s \nannual  disbursements  must  be  allocated  to  roads  owned  by  local  bodies  (district \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of \nNepal for Preparing the Second Rural Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n2  The SRN comprises highways connecting Kathmandu to all the borders and joining the main north-south valleys and \nregional headquarters. The SRN also includes feeder roads that connect from highways to district and zonal \nheadquarters, major places of industry, tourism, public utilities, and power generation. \n3  Tenth Five-Year Plan targets have abandoned this approach and aim to increase the overall network by about 1,000 \nkm and to reconstruct approximately 2,500 km of roads. ", "2   \ndevelopment committees [DDCs], municipalities, and village development committees [VDCs]), \nwhich  must  provide  25%  in  matching  funds.  However,  DDCs  lack  the  funds  to  implement \nDOLIDAR\u2019s  National  Plan  for  Rural  Road  Maintenance (2000), and many districts still have \ninadequate capacity to undertake satisfactory maintenance management. Adequate maintenance \nof the rapidly expanding network of rural roads will need to be prioritized for several years. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  The conflict has displaced about 400,000 landowners, and directly affected about 2.4 \nmillion people, primarily in the three western regions. Infrastructure (primarily government offices, \nand police stations, rather than roads and other infrastructure) has been damaged and economic \nactivity disrupted, with direct impacts on the livelihoods of millions of rural dwellers. Disruption of \nagricultural activities and markets, and migration and displacement of productive workers have \nundermined food security, particularly in western Nepal. Two key problems constraining poverty \nreduction in rural hill and mountain areas are the adverse terrain and low agricultural productivity. \nThese are linked because poor access to inputs, services, and markets due to rugged terrain \nmakes it hard to increase agricultural productivity. Improved physical access is a prerequisite for \nsignificant economic development, mainly through reduced transport costs, leading to (i) increased \nconsumer spending, (ii) diversified agricultural production, (iii) better provision of services by \ngovernment  agencies,  (iv)  greater  use  of  services  and  facilities,  and  (v)  better  access  to \ninformation and knowledge of development opportunities. A subsector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n6.  Since  the  1960s  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  has  been  to  develop  the  SRN  linking \nKathmandu to the borders, main administrative centers, and major economic centers. The next \nstage is to reduce poverty through a substantial increase of the SRN. Construction of rural roads \nconnecting to strategic roads is guided by targets in the national 5-year plans, but otherwise is left \nto individual DDCs to plan through district transport master plans (DTMPs). The last 10 years have \nseen a major shift of external funding agency support to rural roads, with increasing emphasis on \npoverty reduction as a goal rather than economic growth stimulated by increased agricultural \nproduction. The pressing need throughout Nepal for basic infrastructure, which is expensive given \nthe  difficult  terrain,  has  led  to  reliance  on  external  assistance  to  provide  the  initial  capital \ninvestment (Appendix 2). Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Food Programme, World Bank, \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation  (SDC),  Government  of  Germany\u2019s  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ), Netherlands Development Organization, and other external funding agencies are active in \nthe sector. Shared experience has led to a convergence of project approaches, and joint initiatives \nare now common and will be used by the Project. The project approaches all aim to reduce \npoverty and improve livelihoods, using local infrastructure development as a means to an end \nrather than, as previously, an end in itself. \n \n7.  While reliable transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth, the broader issue of social access is of fundamental importance. Roads have stimulated \neconomic growth and high levels of social well-being in the areas served, but can also contribute \nto polarization between different areas and communities\u2014a factor in the conflict in Nepal. The lack \nof education, depth of poverty, high degree of social exclusion of many groups, and vulnerability of \nmost  subsistence  livelihoods  all  point  to  the  need  for  interventions  much  broader  than  the \nconstruction of roads, bridges, and trails alone. Previous road projects have not always enabled \nmany disadvantaged groups to benefit from the opportunities and services that the roads were \nassumed to generate or deliver.  \n \n ", "3  \n8.  Sectoral programs have sought to expand the delivery of services to rural areas rather \nthan concentrate solely on building infrastructure. The strategy of providing roads has benefited \nrural people but not adequately raised living standards. Building on lessons learned (Appendix 1), \na different strategy is clearly required if significant poverty reduction is to be achieved in remote \nareas affected by the conflict. Lessons learned show that substantial infrastructure investments, \ncombined with community development and livelihood enhancement, are required to improve rural \nincomes and welfare. A specific effort must be made to provide the poorest groups with income-\nearning opportunities. This can be achieved by hiring the poor as unskilled labor to construct roads \nthrough hilly terrain. Methods of mobilizing and managing building groups (BGs) formed by poor \nhouseholds have been developed and tested by a number of projects, including, on a pilot basis, \nADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Development Project.4 This approach provides immediate cash income \nbut, perhaps more important, boosts social capital of the most disadvantaged in rural society. The \napproach also provides a point of entry for broad social development interventions to promote \nother livelihood improvements in conflict areas. When coupled with enhanced physical access, \nthis integrated approach leads to a significant positive impact on the rural poor\u2019s living standard.  \n \n9.  Implementing development projects in conflict areas is difficult and subject to rapidly \nchanging conditions that are location specific. However, short- and medium-term interventions to \naddress the immediate consequences of the conflict, such as disruption of livelihoods and damage \nto  infrastructure,  are  urgently  needed.  Recent  experience  in  ADB's  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project,  and  other  development  partners'  rural  infrastructure  projects  in  Nepal \ndemonstrate that the insurgents continue to accept the presence of development programs in all \nareas  that  they  control.  However,  project  interventions  such  as  rehabilitation  of  essential \ninfrastructure, and restoration of livelihoods and essential services must be undertaken in an \ninclusive manner that promotes economic and social equality. The activities must be implemented \nin  a  participatory  and  transparent  manner,  use  traditional  methods  of  social  cooperation, \nincorporate conflict sensitivity, involve the cooperation of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand community groups, and provide jobs to local people, particularly through affirmative action to \novercome economic and social inequalities and discrimination (para. 55). The Tenth Five-Year \nPlan and ADB's new Country Strategy and Program focus on addressing causes of the conflict, \nand support the integrated approach to rural development described in para. 8. \n \n10.  Planning and decision making are being devolved to the district level to improve local \ngovernance,  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  policy.  The  Local  Self-\nGovernance Act (1999) and its supporting regulations provide the framework for a decentralized \napproach and a greater degree of autonomy for DDCs and VDCs. The Government is now \nimplementing  the  act  and  has  devolved  the  responsibility  for  rural  road  construction  and \nmaintenance  to  the  districts.  A  measurable  outcome  of  the  devolution  of  authority  is  the \nwidespread  adoption  of  DTMPs,  which  have  introduced  a  systematic  process  of  inclusive \nparticipatory planning for rural infrastructure. The technical aspects of local development have \nbeen strengthened through the establishment of district technical offices (DTOs) under the control \nof the DDC rather than a central ministry. Ownership and management of local infrastructure \ndevelopment is vested in the DDCs and VDCs, with guidance from DOLIDAR, all of which have \nresource constraints and require capacity building.  \n \n11.  The Project, which the Government considers a flagship project for development under \nconflict conditions, supports the poverty reduction objectives and development policies of ADB and \nthe Government, including the need to address the underlying causes of the conflict. The \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Rural Infrastructure Development Project. Manila. \n ", "4   \nProject also addresses two key causes of slow agricultural growth and limited rural jobs, including \n(i)  lack  of  an  effective  and  properly  maintained  rural  transportation  network;  and  (ii)  weak \ninstitutions, constrained government service delivery, and lack of beneficiary participation. The \nproject design is consistent with and applies the ADB country and sector strategies for Nepal. The \nproject  design  incorporates  at  the  project  level  ADB  policies  on  public-private  partnership, \nanticorruption, and good governance. The intent of national plans, views of poor and conflict-\naffected  communities,  sector  analysis  (Appendix  1),  and  ADB  country  program  strategy  all \nrecognize the need for additional support in remote conflict-affected districts through a poverty \nreduction project focusing on livelihood restoration and infrastructure. The project design meets \nthe needs of the poor, effectively improves access to services and markets, creates jobs, provides \ncash  income  to  the  poorest  households,  and  increases  the  national  network  of  basic  rural \ninfrastructure.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n \n12.  The project goal is to reduce rural poverty in 18 very poor remote hill and mountain districts \naffected by the conflict. The purpose is to achieve sustainable increased access to economic and \nsocial services, and enhance the social and financial capital for people in the project area, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  disadvantaged  in  conflict  areas.  The  Project  will  invest  in  small, \ncommunity  socioeconomic  infrastructure;  and  provide  jobs,  empower  rural  communities  for \ndevelopment, increase institutional capacity, and improve accountability and transparency. The \nProject will also extend the network of improved rural transport infrastructure, consisting of roads, \ntrails, and pedestrian bridges. The Project will improve the livelihoods of people in the project \nareas, particularly the poor, who constitute about 70% of the subproject area population. The \nProject will be in 18 hill and mountain districts throughout Nepal.5 The districts were selected on \nthe basis of their high incidence and intensity of poverty, need for restoration of incomes affected \nby  the  conflict,  need  for  improved  access  and  enhanced  livelihoods,  and  how  manageable \nimplementation will be. The project framework is in Appendix 3. The project concept and approach \nare in Appendix 4.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n13.  The Project comprises (i) community development and rural livelihood restoration, (ii) \ncapacity building and decentralized governance, (iii) rural transport infrastructure, and (iv) project \nmanagement services. \n \n  1.  Community Development and Rural Livelihood Restoration \n \n14.  The output of this component is intended to restore incomes and the livelihoods of rural \npeople, particularly the poor, in the subproject areas. The component addresses the need for \neffective beneficiary participation in planning, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance that \nare essential to achieve a poverty-targeted impact from the rural infrastructure investments. The \ncomponent, with the support of local NGOs will lead to increased social and financial capital in the \nsubproject areas by (i) embedding the practice of participation in rural communities; (ii) instilling \nchanges in cultural attitudes that inhibit development; increasing the social inclusion of excluded \n                                                 \n5 The Far Western districts are Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula; the Midwestern region districts are Dolpa, Humla, \nJajarkot, Jumla, Kalikot, and Mugu; the Western region districts are Baglung, Gorkha, Lamjung, and Myagdi; and the \nCentral and Eastern region districts are Okhaldhunga, Ramechhap, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.   \n ", "5  \nand vulnerable groups; and empowering the poor and disadvantaged, including women; and (iii) \nfacilitating  and  supporting  the  initiation  and  operation  of  other  development  activities  in  the \ncommunities through supplementary investments. The Project will implement a social mobilization \nprogram in each district, delivered through local NGOs\u2014an approach that has been working in \nconflict-affected districts. The component has three aspects: community development, job creation \nand access to development opportunities, and supplementary investments. \n \n15.  Community  Development.  Community  development  activities  will  strengthen  the \ncapacities  of  communities,  and  develop  the  practice  of  beneficiary  participation,  ensure  the \ninvolvement and targeting of the poorest and most disadvantaged groups, and promote social \ncohesion. These goals will be achieved by support activities that (i) raise awareness of the Project \nand the opportunities it offers among all social groups in the target area; (ii) help communities \npropose possible local infrastructure subprojects; (iii) include social surveys as part of subproject \nfeasibility studies to identify the key target groups for project support; (iv) facilitate beneficiary \nparticipation and community auditing of implementation through a pro-poor delivery mechanism; \nand (v) identify, prioritize, implement, and maintain supplementary investments.  \n \n16.  Job Creation and Access to Development Opportunities. Unskilled jobs on the main \nsubproject construction works will be reserved for people living in the infrastructure\u2019s influence \narea. The first priority for employment will be the poor and disadvantaged groups and castes, \nfollowed by households affected by conflict, and the acquisition of land and other assets. Workers \nwill be paid in full, promptly, and fortnightly. Building on the participatory activities carried out for \ncommunity development, the social mobilization program will (i) identify poor households of all \ncastes and disadvantaged groups; (ii) encourage these groups, particularly women, to take jobs \non project works; (iii) support the formation of BGs of 15-25 persons; and (iv) train the BG in \nconstruction and life skills, and group leaders in bookkeeping and leadership skills. Women will be \nallocated at least 40% of the unskilled labor where sufficient demand exists, with women-only BGs \nformed, and women encouraged to become group leaders. BG members will be expected to \nconvert the BG into a savings group, to ensure that a proportion of construction wages are \nretained to help pay off household debts and invest in small-scale income-generation activities. \nThe BGs will also receive useful life-skill training. This process provides a mechanism to translate \nthe short-term benefits from employment on project works into longer-term impacts on livelihoods \nthrough provision of life skills and capital formation (paras. 8 and 24; Appendix 10, para. 13; and \nAppendix 11, para. 3). \n \n17.  Supplementary  Investments  to  Restore  Rural  Livelihoods.  The  infrastructure \nsubprojects  will  all  be  accompanied  by  supplementary  investments  to  build  or  rehabilitate \ncommunity-level infrastructure in villages within subproject areas. The supplementary investments\u2019 \ncost will be 15-20% of the main subproject\u2019s cost. Eligible supplementary investments must show \na clear access benefit related to the main subproject, and may include improvement of village \ntrails and building of pedestrian bridges; construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, drinking \nwater  schemes;  rehabilitation  of  small  irrigation  schemes;  construction  of  micro-hydropower \nschemes;  construction  of  a  market  or  community  building;  and  construction  of  new,  or \nrehabilitation and improvement of existing, health facilities and primary-school buildings. These \nsupplementary investments will be identified and proposed by the beneficiary communities through \na participatory process that involves the poorest and most socially excluded groups, facilitated by \nNGO social mobilizers. The beneficiary communities will be required to contribute 15% of the \ninvestment cost in the form of voluntary labor and local materials, an arrangement that enhances \ncommunity ownership of the investment. Duplication of activities of other development projects will \nbe avoided while synergies are developed. \n \n ", "6   \n \n  2.  Capacity Building and Decentralized Governance \n \n18.  This component will provide district and national capacity building to promote improved \ndecentralized governance. The component outputs will (i) establish the capacity for sustainable \nmanagement of planned maintenance of rural road networks, without which the benefits from \ninfrastructure investment will be short-lived; (ii) strengthen the decentralized management of rural \ninfrastructure  development,  implementation,  and  monitoring,  and  improve  local  governance \n(including public audits), to help reduce poverty; and (iii) increase central capacity to provide \nnational direction, guidance, support, and monitoring to local government bodies. The outputs will \ncontribute to long-term impacts on poverty reduction and improve rural livelihoods.  \n \n19.  Creating the capacity for and establishing sustainable planning, construction, monitoring, \nand maintenance of rural road networks by communities, VDCs, and DDCs are central to the \nproject design. The Project will provide a variety of training courses to strengthen local rural road \nplanning, construction, and maintenance management capacity, and a movement to sustainable \nfinancing. Each district will be required to set up a district road maintenance fund with limited \nfinancial support from loan funds before construction works start on the first subprojects. This \ncritical initiative will be supported by intensive district capacity-building activities for subproject \nselection, survey, design, site supervision, and maintenance. Skills will also be provided to VDC, \nDTO, and DDC staff in accounting, financial management, and environmental evaluation. A key \nproject output is to create district capacity to contract out services to the private and NGO sectors. \n \n20.  Similarly, at the national level the Project will reinforce the technical and management \ncapacities of DOLIDAR by providing TA, transport and office equipment, training, and resources to \ndraw upon specialized services from domestic consultants and national NGOs. The Project will \nalso develop DOLIDAR\u2019s capability to manage increased contracting-out of services to the private \nand NGO sectors as the most effective strategy to strengthen DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity as a modern \npublic  sector  institution.  An  institutional  development  TA  that  supports  broad,  sector-wide \nimprovements in DOLIDAR\u2019s activities will supplement TA provided under the loan. Improved \naccountability and transparency are intended to be among the district and central outcomes \n(paras. 44-45). \n      \n  3.  Rural Transport Infrastructure \n \n21.  The outputs of this component will be (i) construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, \ndistrict roads and village roads,6 including provision of small cross-drainage structures and all \nprotection structures; (ii) rehabilitation and upgrading of existing main trails; and (iii) construction of \nnew trail bridges on existing main trails. These outputs will be augmented by supplementary \ninvestments in minor village and community infrastructure within the influence area of the main \nsubprojects (para. 17).  \n \n22.  Infrastructure will be built through a series of subprojects. Each participating district will be \nallocated a proportion of the project investment funds (about $0.8 million in the first phase of the \nProject),  and  the  subprojects  will  be  selected  and  approved  in  four  stages:  identification, \nprioritization, feasibility study, and approval by DDCs. Underpinned by the initial social mobilization \nand capacity-building activities, the targeted communities in VDC areas and other stakeholders in \neach  district  will  participate  in  identifying  possible  subprojects  following  dissemination  of \n                                                 \n6 A district road connects one or more major growth centers or villages with the district headquarters or the SRN. A   \nvillage road connects a VDC center with another VDC, the SRN, a district road, or a major growth center. \n ", "7  \ninformation on eligibility and prioritization criteria (para. 34). Identified possible subprojects will be \nreviewed at the district level to confirm their eligibility and assess their priority in terms of (i) the \noverall  justification,  and  (ii)  specific  cost-effectiveness  criteria  that  compare  the  number  of \nbeneficiaries and of poor beneficiaries with the indicative cost and the change in level of access \nthat will result. Subprojects will be built to DOLIDAR standards using labor-based, environmentally \nfriendly, and participatory (LEP) techniques. This entails maximum use of unskilled local laborers, \nsupplemented with skilled craftsmen employed by the Project as necessary. For more complex \nstructures, small contractors may be required to provide adequate skills, but would be regulated by \nclauses requiring most of the workforce to be local. Road designs will be based on surveyed \nlongitudinal alignments and cross-sections rather than the traditional but costly office-based full \ndesign. While this approach maximizes direct benefits to the rural poor in project areas, it requires \na high level of site supervision to ensure quality of work, incorporation of safety standards into \nroad  designs,  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  built.  Project  implementation  arrangements \nprovide for this. \n \n4.  Project Management Services \n \n23.  A project coordination unit (PCU) has been established in Kathmandu and staffed by \nDOLIDAR, and will be assisted by consultants (para. 31). The DDCs will be responsible for project \nimplementation in the project districts. The DDCs will delegate implementation tasks to the DTOs, \nand the Project will support a district project office (DPO), which will include DTO staff, domestic \nconsultants,  and  local  NGO  staff.  The  DDC  will  ensure  that  a  full-time  engineer,  sufficient \noverseers, and accountant staff the DTOs.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n24.  The  project  components  are  primarily  focused  on  poverty  reduction  and  livelihood \nrestoration  in  conflict-affected  districts  rather  than  infrastructure  development  alone.  The \ncomponents are integrated, with the infrastructure built using appropriate, labor-based methods as \nthe entry point for rural livelihood-enhancement interventions. Numerous small BGs, formed locally \nfrom the poorest people of the community, will undertake construction work. These BGs form the \ninitial basis of project efforts to boost human and social capital. Disadvantaged castes and ethnic \nminorities are predominantly found in the poorest groups and will be specifically targeted by the \nProject for BG membership and life-skill training. Poor women from these groups will be directly \ntargeted to join BGs and will receive full training and a support program aimed at the multiple \ndimensions of poverty. This program will help reduce poverty by addressing the many influences \non livelihoods and poverty, and offer immediate income-earning opportunities. The community \ndevelopment  component  will  enable  these  groups  to  participate  fully  in  community  decision \nmaking. All of these activities will seek to mitigate the adverse impacts of the conflict and its root \ncauses. \n \n25.  The  Project\u2019s  emphasis  on  participation  includes  active  community  involvement  in \nplanning  supplementary  investments  to  enhance  rural  livelihoods  and  restore  incomes  in \nconnection with access improvements provided by road and trail infrastructure. Much of the \ninvestment is, therefore, process based rather than prescriptive, and as a result project planning \nhas  only  provided  indicative  guidelines  for  the  kinds  and  scales  of  investment  that  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. In a wider process that underpins support for construction of \nphysical infrastructure, social mobilizers will ensure that all local people gain access and livelihood \nbenefits from the project activities. \n \n ", "8   \n26.  Another  special  project  feature  is  the  high  level  of  integration  with  similar  projects \nsupported by other funding agencies, to ensure that DTOs can administer their responsibilities. \nThe Project will collaborate closely with other sectoral initiatives and share technical support \ncapacity  on  a  district-by-district  basis.  This  will  help  enhance  decentralized  governance  by \npromoting localized implementation without overloading developing institutions, and harmonize \nrural infrastructure interventions in conflict-affected districts.7 \n \n27.  The  Project  also  accords  with  the  Government\u2019s  emerging  strategy  for  rural  road \nmaintenance, including establishment of district road maintenance funds, required to provide \nmatching funds to access money from the central road fund (para. 39). Linked to DTO capacity \nbuilding, the road funds will for the first time allow a reasonable level of structured maintenance \nmanagement on rural roads, thereby making the investment fully sustainable. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n28.  The estimated project cost is $62.3 million equivalent, inclusive of physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $5.3 million, or about 8.5% of the total cost. The local currency cost \nis estimated at $57.0 million equivalent, or about 91.5% of the total cost. The local currency costs \ninclude an estimated $1.3 million equivalent for taxes and duties to be paid by the Government. \nThe project cost estimate (Table 1) should be regarded as indicative only. The detailed project \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 5. \n                                                 \n7 The Project will also coordinate closely and avoid duplication with other ADB projects operating in the same districts, \nparticularly the Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, and the proposed gender equality and \nempowerment of women project.    \n ", "9  \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million)a \n  \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n29.  The Government has requested a loan of $40 million equivalent from ADB's Special Funds \nto help finance 64% of the project cost. The loan will fund $5.3 million (100% of the total foreign \nexchange cost), and $34.7 million equivalent of the local currency cost (61% of the total local \ncurrency cost). The Government has been requested to provide $14.7 million equivalent, or 24% \nof the project cost. The Government of Switzerland has been requested to provide parallel and \ntied grant cofinancing through SDC for financial cooperation of $1.9 million equivalent, or 3% of \nthe project cost to support community development and TA in three districts8 in the Central and \nEastern regions. The purpose is to expand the support through the ongoing District Road Support \nProgram (DRSP) to include the Project\u2019s community development and TA requirements in the \nthree districts. The Government of Germany has been requested to provide parallel and tied grant \ncofinancing through GTZ for financial cooperation of $0.7 million equivalent, or 1% of the project \ncost to support community development and TA in Darchula in the Far Western region, to expand \nthe ongoing support through the World Food Programme\u2019s Rural Community Infrastructure Works \nProject to include the Project\u2019s community development and TA requirements in Darchula. DDCs \nwill contribute $4.2 million equivalent or 7% of the project cost by contributing 10% of the cash cost \nfor rural transport infrastructure, and 33% for its maintenance. Households that benefit from \nsupplementary  livelihood-enhancement  investments  will  contribute  $0.8  million  or  1%  of  the \n                                                 \n8 Okhaldhunga, Ramechhap,  and Solukhumbu districts.   \n ", "10   \nproject cost through the households\u2019 labor inputs in constructing the supplementary investments \n(15% of the cost of the supplementary infrastructure).  \n  \n30.  If necessary, ADB and the Government will continue to collaborate with, and possibly seek \ncofinancing  from,  various  development  partners.  If  additional  funds  become  available  during \nprocessing  or  implementation,  the  scope  of  infrastructure  funded  from  the  loan  will  be \ncorrespondingly increased. Local cost financing is justified given the poverty-oriented nature of the \nProject, and the country\u2019s tight fiscal situation. The Borrower will be the Government of Nepal. The \nADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry \nan interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and an interest charge of 1.5% per annum \nduring amortization.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n31.  DOLIDAR will be the project Executing Agency, since its function is to provide national \ndirection in the rural infrastructure subsector. The technical and project management skills of \nDOLIDAR have developed substantially since its formation, through support from ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, and through its experience of managing a number of rural infrastructure \nprojects. DOLIDAR has established a PCU in Kathmandu. The PCU will guide and monitor the \nDDCs in implementing project components. It will manage overall project planning, and fund \nallocation and disbursement. The existing DRSP central project implementation consultant team \nwill be part of the PCU, advise DOLIDAR on project management, and provide much of the \ncapacity development assistance to the districts. The PCU use of the existing DRSP management \nstructure will lead to substantial resource savings, since the Project will require only incremental \nconsultants.  The  PCU  will  liaise  with  the  coordination  unit  of  the  GTZ-Rural  Community \nInfrastructure Works Project that has technical responsibility for support in Darchula.  \n \n32.  Ministry of Local Development (MLD) has reconstituted existing steering committees to form \na joint project steering committee for all development partners\u2019 rural transport projects, in an \nintegrated sector-wide approach. The steering committee will meet as necessary, but not less than \n ", "11  \ntwice a year, to review progress, resolve policy issues, and guide DOLIDAR. The MLD secretary \nwill chair the committee. A project implementation coordination committee will be chaired by the \ndirector general of DOLIDAR and include representatives of all other rural infrastructure projects \nworking in the project districts, and of any cofinanciers. Representatives of other stakeholder \norganizations9 will be co-opted as necessary. The committee will meet at least every 6 months. Its \nresponsibility will be to address and resolve implementation issues, and to advise the PCU on \ntechnical matters, and the project steering committee on policy matters.  \n \n33.  At the district level, project implementation will be the responsibility of DPOs within the \nDTO  of  each  DDC.  The  DPO  will  prepare  annual  work  programs  based  on  the  agreed-on \nsubprojects, and ensure that land acquisition and environmental procedures are completed on \ntime before construction. Road subprojects will be planned and overseen by the district road \ncoordination committee, which is effectively a DDC subcommittee. The DPO will arrange the \nprocurement of appropriate services and community-level training, and will supervise and monitor \nworks implementation. Village works and road construction committees will form the BGs in each \nVDC area and monitor implementation. The DPO will also coordinate (i) application for, and \nselection of, possible supplementary investments in the VDC areas in subproject areas; and (ii) \nimplementation through local NGOs of livelihood-enhancement activities using intensive social \nmobilization. A domestic engineering consultant to cover technical issues, and a local NGO to \nundertake social mobilization and assist BGs will be engaged by, and support, the DPO.  \n \n2.  Subproject Implementation \n \n34.  Project implementation will start with a preconstruction phase of more than 1 year, during \nwhich essential preparatory activities will be carried out. During this time, DDCs will select possible \nfirst-phase subprojects following agreed-on eligibility criteria such as size, improved access and \nlivelihoods, connectivity from existing passable rural transport infrastructure network, and priority \nas defined by the DTMP. Subprojects are envisaged to consist mostly of sections of rural district \nroads, to be built or upgraded by local unskilled workers to environmentally sound standards and \nto provide a high-priority access link. The PCU will approve all subprojects and seek ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence. While participating DDCs will need to satisfy certain conditions to qualify for an initial \nsubproject, funds for second-phase subprojects will be allocated on a performance basis. To \nqualify for funding for a second-phase subproject, DDCs must have implemented the first-phase \nsubproject, demonstrated a commitment to reduce poverty, and established and successfully \noperated a district road maintenance fund.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n35.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years and 8 months. Implementation is expected \nto begin in the first quarter of 2005. Initial activities will include filling any vacant PCU positions, \nrecruiting  consultants,  selecting  local  NGOs,  beginning  social  mobilization  in  the  districts, \nestablishing a project performance monitoring system in DOLIDAR, beginning to plan the outline \ndesign  of  subprojects  to  be  implemented  in  2005,  completing  a  benchmark  survey,  and \nprocuring essential equipment. Physical works may not start before the third quarter of 2005 to \nallow time to complete social mobilization, select subprojects, complete surveys, and prepare \ndetailed engineering designs and environmental and resettlement studies. The loan-use period \nwill terminate on 29 February 2012. The Government will not begin any ADB-financed civil-\nworks construction until after the implementation consultants have been appointed; land and \nrights to land, free of encumbrances, are available for construction; and resettlement activities \n                                                 \n9 For example, the Association of DDCs, and Association of VDCs. \n ", "12   \nand compensation payments have been completed. A project implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 6. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n36.  Goods, related services, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All civil works will be small and widely dispersed, with an \naverage  value  of  $10,000\u2013$15,000  equivalent,  and  most  will  be  undertaken  by  unskilled \ncommunity labor, following ADB\u2019s guidelines on community participation in procurement. In \nisolated instances, small civil-works contracts may be required, which will be procured by the \nDPO  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive  bidding  among  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Prequalification,  selection,  and \nengagement of contractors will be subject to ADB\u2019s approval. Supply contracts for equipment or \nmaterials are not expected to cost $500,000 or more, but should a contract be required it will be \nawarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  Those  costing  less  than  the \nequivalent of $500,000 (other than minor items) will be awarded on the basis of international \nshopping. Direct purchase will be used for small or off-the-shelf items valued at less than \n$100,000. The PCU and DTOs will procure the equipment and vehicles. Indicative procurement \npackages are in Appendix 7. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n37.  The  PCU  will  select  the  central  implementation  support  consultants.  Other  required \nconsulting services in the districts will be engaged by the DPOs in accordance with Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. Quality- and cost-based selection procedures will be \nused to recruit the consultants, using full technical proposals. An international firm in association \nwith domestic firms will provide services totaling 515 consultant person-months, consisting of 90 \nperson-months  of  international  and  425  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB  has \napproved advance action to begin recruiting implementation consultants from the appraisal \nmission  date  to  the  ADB  loan  effectiveness  date  to  facilitate  the  start-up  of  project \nimplementation. The Government has been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. The summary terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 8. Grant cofinancing is being sought for the Project. Should grant cofinancing be \nsecured, the grant will finance project TA elements. \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n38.  Land  acquisition  problems  can  be  a  major  source  of  delays  in  implementing \ndevelopment projects. Consequently, land acquisition requirements under the Project will be \nminimized.  To  curtail  implementation  delays  due  to  land  acquisition,  project  infrastructure \nlocation will be carefully determined. A subproject agreement will be signed by each DDC with \nthe Project. Compensation determination committees will also be convened in each district, and \nvillage works and roads construction committees will ensure that all project-affected people are \nfairly compensated. The DPO, in cooperation with the committees, will complete the preparatory \nwork for land acquisition before submitting subproject appraisal reports. Land acquisition will be \ncompleted within 365 days from the signing of the subproject agreement; otherwise, the subproject \nwill be removed from the Project. Should a subproject require any involuntary resettlement, the \nsubproject appraisal report will include a short or full resettlement plan, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  guidelines,  resettlement  policy,  and  project  resettlement  framework.  All \n ", "13  \ncompensation and resettlement activities will be completed before possession of land and \nother assets. The DPO will publicly disclose the resettlement plans in each subproject area after \nsubproject appraisal.  \n \n7.  Maintenance \n \n39.  DDCs are responsible for maintenance, including financing, of district roads, and main \ntrails  and  their  bridges;  while  VDCs  are  responsible  for  smaller-scale  infrastructure such as \nsupplementary infrastructure. Their resources, skills, and maintenance management systems are \nweak. The Project will encourage DDCs to take on their maintenance responsibilities by providing \ninitial financing for district road maintenance funds, on a matching-fund basis, and subject to \nDDCs  establishing  a  district  rural  road  maintenance  fund,  and  subsequently  adequately \nmaintaining existing roads (para. 57 [x]; and Appendix 1, para. 5). This will contribute to the \nfinancing  of  maintenance  works  during  the  project  period,  when  management  capacity,  and \nplanning  and  implementation  procedures  are  being  developed  and  tested  with  support  from \nconsultants.  The  Project  will  encourage  the  formation  and  operation  of  user  committees \nrepresenting transport operators and other regular road users. These committees can be valuable \nin representing beneficiary interests, restricting heavy-vehicle use, monitoring road conditions and \nmaintenance performance, and mobilizing resources for essential maintenance. At the central \nlevel,  the  proposed  institutional  development  TA  (paras.  44-45,  and  Appendix  9)  will  help \nDOLIDAR establish effective planned rural road maintenance practices. The Government\u2019s newly \nestablished Road Board and its associated fund will also bolster the supply of maintenance funds. \nThe board is required to allocate 30% of its annual funds for rural road maintenance by local \nbodies.  \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n40.  The few civil works contracts to be awarded will generally be small in value. To ensure \neffective  project  implementation  and  timely  disbursement,  the  Government  will  establish  a \nproject account at the Nepal Rastra Bank. Project funding (other than DDC and beneficiary \ncounterpart funds) comprising counterpart funds provided by the Government, and ADB funds \nwill be channeled to pay all costs of the Project (other than those funded by local counterpart \nfunds) through the following routes: (i) to the district development fund and then into each \nDDC\u2019s project operating account, and (ii) into the PCU project operating account. From each \nDDC\u2019s project operating account, the funds will be used to pay for infrastructure investments \nand their maintenance, land acquisition and resettlement costs, NGOs and local consultants, \nand district office equipment and vehicles and their operating costs. The PCU will prepare \ndisbursement projections, request budgetary allocations for central counterpart funds, collect \nsupporting  documents,  and  prepare  withdrawal  applications  and  send  them  to  ADB  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB project funding will periodically be \ndisbursed from the ADB loan account into a subaccount of the project account. The subaccount \nwill operate as an imprest account for the ADB project funding. Payments for eligible items will \nbe made through this account. The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedure will be adopted \nto facilitate reimbursement and liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account and the SOE \nprocedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The ceiling of the imprest account will not exceed the estimated ADB-\nfinanced expenditures for the next 6 months, or $1 million, whichever is lower. The SOE \nprocedure is applicable for reimbursing eligible expenditures for any individual payment not \nexceeding $50,000 equivalent and liquidating advances provided for in the imprest account. \n \n ", "14   \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n41.  DOLIDAR  will  submit  to  ADB  trimester  and  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation. The PCU will prepare the reports, particularly addressing progress in meeting \nproject targets. The reports will include information on the Project\u2019s physical progress and the \nproject components\u2019 status. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s substantial physical completion, \nDOLIDAR will submit to ADB a project completion report covering project implementation, cost, \nproject performance management activities, and other information requested by ADB. DOLIDAR \nwill maintain separate project accounts and records to facilitate identification of project-related \nincome and expenditures. The PCU will be assigned sufficient and qualified accounting staff, \nincluding an accounts officer. An auditor acceptable to ADB will annually audit all project-related \naccounts, SOEs, and revenues. The Auditor General\u2019s Office of Nepal is acceptable for this \npurpose. The annual audit will cover the imprest account and SOE procedure. The annual audit \nreport  will  include  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedure. Audited financial statements and project accounts, together with the report of the \nauditor, will be submitted within 9 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.  The PCU will use a participatory and gender-sensitive project performance monitoring \nprogram to ensure that project activities and facilities are managed efficiently and that target \ngroups receive the intended benefits, modeled on ADB\u2019s monitoring system. Monitoring activities \nwill assess whether the project inputs and activities have delivered the expected outputs and \nbenefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries.  Monitoring  will  cover  capacity  building,  planning, \nresettlement  issues,  and  distribution  of  project  benefits  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts.  \nMonitoring will safeguard vulnerable beneficiaries at the community level ensuring that subprojects \nare not distorted and benefits diverted by village and district elites. The monitoring system will also \nbe used to detect at an early stage any discrepancy between the project plan and its execution. \nParticipatory beneficiary monitoring and public audits will promote effective implementation. The \nPCU will ensure that any required district-level baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys are \nconducted,  and  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and \npreparing gender-disaggregated benchmark information for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within \n6 months of loan effectiveness. Thereafter, the PCU will submit annual benefit monitoring reports \nto ADB throughout the implementation period. A detailed study will review project progress before \nthe ADB midterm review. DOLIDAR will complete an impact evaluation study before the PCU \nprepares the project completion report. \n \n11.  Project Review \n \n43.  ADB will review the Project at least twice a year, supplemented by a midterm review to \nbe carried out by the Government and ADB in mid-2007. The regular project reviews will cover \nthe performance of DOLIDAR, PCU, DDCs, DTOs, and NGOs; implementation of the loan \ncovenants and gender action plan; physical progress of project implementation; representation \nof the poor and excluded groups in project implementation; and capacity-building activities. The \nmidterm review will allow the Government and ADB to monitor the Project and to adjust the \nproject design and implementation arrangements, if necessary. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "15  \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n44.  A small institutional development TA will be extremely valuable in supporting capacity \nbuilding in DOLIDAR in a number of key complementary areas, but with a sector perspective. The \nTA will also continue to develop national policies and strategies that previous ADB TA has \nsupported,10 and in particular to further decentralization. The TA will promote the draft national \npolicy and strategy on local infrastructure development by strengthening DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity and \neffectiveness, and the development of improved procedures and practices for different aspects of \nrural  infrastructure  management,  particularly  road  maintenance.  The  TA  will  draw  together, \nassess, and build on the achievements and experience of procedures already being used in \ndifferent programs within the sector. The highest priority is to help DOLIDAR instill a maintenance \nculture in DDCs, and establish effective planned rural road maintenance practices. A range of \nsubjects require new or revised procedures, and priorities will be agreed on before the TA period, \nbased on a detailed review of ongoing initiatives and with the consensus of key stakeholders. The \nterms of reference, cost estimate, and financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 9. \n \n45.  The total TA cost is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB  to  finance  $400,000  equivalent,  covering  all  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs  ($270,000 \nequivalent) and part of the local costs. The TA will be funded by ADB on a grant basis from its TA \nfunding program. The proposed government contribution of $100,000 equivalent will cover office \nand staff costs, field transport, and facilities for seminars and training. The international consultant \nwill be recruited from the International Labour Organization, which supplied the specialist inputs in \nprevious ADB TA to DOLIDAR and has satisfactorily provided such assistance to a number of \nother ADB rural infrastructure projects. The international team leader will manage the consultant \nteam and TA output finalization. The TA will be housed in a separate office in DOLIDAR, staffed \nby a grade-II engineer and by support staff to work as counterparts to the consultants. The \ncounterpart team will liaise closely with other divisions of DOLIDAR, with other projects in the \nsector and MLD, and with DDCs.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n \n46.  The  Project  seeks  to  reduce  rural  poverty  through  increased  access  to  economic \nopportunities and social services. The Project\u2019s economic impacts include increased economic \ngrowth  and  jobs  in  the  project  area.  Communities living within the influence area of rural \ntransport  infrastructure  subprojects  will  benefit  from  better  access  to  markets,  sources  of \nproduction inputs, and extension services. Transport costs for, and time spent on, input supply \nand marketing of surpluses will be reduced. With better market access farmers will be able to \nconsider expanding production and cultivating high-value crops. Farmers will respond to these \nincentives through the price mechanism to increase the value of rural crop production and \nreduce food insecurity. Productive agriculture, reduced travel costs, and improved access to \nservices for subproject beneficiaries will together create on- and off-farm rural jobs. \n \n47.  The  economic  evaluation  analyzes  the  economic  viability  of  five  types  of  transport \ninfrastructure that the Project will finance. Appraised at a 12% discount rate, all the subprojects \nhave economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) higher than 12%. The district road rehabilitation \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Institutional Strengthening for Rural Infrastructure \nDevelopment. Manila. ADB 1998. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Institutional Reforms in the \nAgriculture Sector. Manila \n ", "16   \nand main trail improvement subprojects show very robust economic viability, with EIRRs greater \nthan 30%. The remaining three types of subproject (new trail bridge, new village road, and village \nroad rehabilitation) have rates of return of around 13%, close to the limit of viability. Their lower \nrate of economic return is to be expected given the project focus on poor areas with limited \nresource  endowments.  The  subprojects,  however,  will  generate  significant,  but  not  easily \nquantifiable, additional benefits, including direct employment of local poor people on construction \nworks, capacity building, improvements in livelihoods, restoration of incomes, and increased use \nby rural communities of health and educational services. Any roads supported by the Project will \nbe trafficable during the dry season. The period of closure through the monsoon does not have a \nsignificant impact on benefits, since there are few agricultural products at that time of year, and \ntravel is traditionally low during this busy crop-growing period. The summary project justification \nand financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 10. \n \nB.   Poverty Reduction Impacts \n \n48.  Approximately 2.5 million people live in the selected districts, of whom 1.5 million are \nbelow the poverty line. Assuming that subproject funds are invested primarily in motorable \nroads, 800,000\u20131,200,000 direct beneficiaries are estimated, 65% or more of whom (520,000\u2013\n780,000) will be poor. Of these, about 25% (130,000\u2013195,000) are from disadvantaged castes. \nEstimates show that 780,000 poor people will directly benefit from a wage income increase of \naround 25% over the subproject and supplementary investment construction period, and that \n200,000 people will be lifted out of poverty. A total of 34,700 person-years of employment are \nexpected to be created by the project infrastructure investments, significantly contributing to \nincome restoration in conflict-affected districts.  \n \n49.  The skill training received as part of BG mobilization gives the very poor, particularly \ndisadvantaged  castes  and  ethnic  minorities,  increased  capability  to  benefit  from  other \ndevelopment initiatives and to increase social capital, resulting in a decrease in social exclusion \nand vulnerability. All the people in the subproject zones of influence will benefit from improved \naccess to markets and other service facilities, resulting in improved life choices and increased \nwelfare and income. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n \n50.  Besides increasing income, the Project will reduce the social exclusion of very poor \nhouseholds,  particularly  disadvantaged  castes  and  ethnic  minorities,  through  a  social \nmobilization program of community workshops focusing on participation, gender, and integration \nof issues concerning women and disadvantaged castes within local communities. Community \nawareness training will increase participation in decision making, raise social capital, reduce \ndiscrimination of women, enable access to other development opportunities, and increase the \nuse of local health and education facilities by all social groups. Increasing awareness will \nreduce  vulnerabilities  and  increase  capacity  building  for  all  individuals  and  communities. \nIncreased  community  participation  by  all  social  groups  will  enable  representative  decision \nmaking and effective planning, and reduce elite control of rural life, thereby addressing one of \nthe causes of the conflict. Increased confidence and participation in community life by the most \nvulnerable  will  provide  long-term  social  benefits,  expanding  life  choices  so  that  the \ndisadvantaged can lift themselves out of poverty and have a more secure, less vulnerable \nfuture. The Project will also support building capacity of local NGOs to deliver support and \ntraining to communities and BGs through programs already developed for the selected districts \n ", "17  \nby other agencies. Enhanced NGO capacities will produce long-term benefits for other NGO \nprogram activities in the project districts. \nD.  Gender and Development Issues \n \n51.  Lack of access and low levels of human capital constrain poor rural women who face \nproblems  in  marketing  produce,  using  health  services,  finding  jobs,  obtaining clean water, \ncollecting fodder and fuel wood, and traveling to district centers. The ongoing conflict has \ngenerated new challenges for women as men either join the conflict or migrate to escape it, \nleaving  women  to  manage  daily  family  subsistence  needs.  The  Project  will  increase  (i) \nparticipation of women and disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes in subproject planning, and \n(ii)  capacity  of  policymakers  and  managers  to  promote  good  governance  and  gender \nresponsiveness. The Project will specifically implement a gender action plan with set activities \nand targets to enhance the social and financial capital of women. If significant indigenous \npeoples issues emerge in subprojects during project implementation, an indigenous peoples \nplan will be prepared. \n \nE.  Resettlement \n \n52.  The main socially negative impacts of infrastructure projects result from permanent land \nacquisition. The Project may require significant land acquisition where new roads will be built. A \nproject resettlement framework was prepared to ensure compliance with ADB's resettlement \npolicy. This framework and a sample summary resettlement plan for a core subproject are \nsupplementary appendixes. \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n \n53.  The Project is not likely to cause any significant negative environmental impacts since \nseveral safeguards have been incorporated into the project design. Subprojects that exceed \nthresholds warranting environmental impact assessments or are in designated environmentally \nsensitive areas are excluded from consideration at the subproject selection stage. Subprojects that \nrequire initial environmental examinations (IEEs) will be identified through the subproject selection \ncriteria. The Project will provide technical and financial support to ensure that the IEE is conducted \nand mitigation measures implemented to the standards of government and ADB environmental \nregulations. Subprojects are designed and constructed adopting the LEP approach, which aims to \nminimize  environmental  impacts. Project activities will be independently monitored to ensure \ncompliance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures.  MLD  will  select \nsubprojects and approve subproject IEEs. Subprojects costing more than $30,000 per kilometer \nwill also require ADB approval. The above procedures for screening and designing a subproject \nbased on an IEE were carried out during project preparation. The procedures were considered \nsufficient to ensure compliance with government and ADB environmental regulations.  \nG.   Risks \n \n54.  The armed conflict and instability represent a project risk. The project districts include \nthose that are active sites for conflict. In general, the experience of development partners working \nin  conflict  areas  is  that  the  insurgents  have  not  hindered  rural  infrastructure  project \nimplementation, since rural communities attach a high priority to improving livelihoods and rural \naccess. The Project will seek to work gradually through local people and ongoing projects of \ndevelopment partners with the assistance of local NGOs, and to emphasize transparency and \n ", "18   \nflexibility. Achievement of tangible benefits for communities as quickly as possible is an important \nsuccess factor in working in conflict areas. Based on the experience of ongoing projects of \ndevelopment  partners,  rural  infrastructure  and  livelihood  improvement  projects  can  be \nimplemented in conflict areas if the above approaches are used. The Project will apply the key \nlessons learned, which are to work gradually with the communities, and to take a flexible approach \nin each location. Local conditions will be closely monitored. \n \n55.  Local elites could attempt to use the Project\u2019s injection of funds into a district to improve \ntheir personal circumstances, and to use their patronage and influence to divert project resources \nto their own benefit and away from the intended beneficiaries. The project design incorporates a \nwide array of measures to mitigate this risk. These include awareness raising and information \ndissemination, social mobilization, use of BGs whose members are poor and from disadvantaged \ngroups, community-based auditing, intensive on-site supervision, capacity building for participatory \nand accountable operation of the DDCs, and emphasis on monitoring project processes and \nDDCs\u2019 performance. These measures are intended to prevent improper diversion of funds, and to \nallow prompt identification of any misuse of funds so that remedial actions can be taken and, if \nappropriate, sanctions imposed.  \n \n56.  A risk associated with achieving the intended long-term benefits from improved rural \ntransport infrastructure is that the roads will not be maintained in good condition. During project \nimplementation the risk is that DDCs may not be able to mobilize sufficient resources to maintain \nproject-financed,  and  other  motorable,  links  in  their  rural  road  networks.  The  project  design \nprovides financing support and sets targets for the districts at different stages of implementation. \nAchievement  of  these  targets  will  be  monitored  to  assess  the  DDCs\u2019  performance.  Project \nmeasures will also seek to create a maintenance culture in the project districts, and to establish \nlocal capacity for planned maintenance. In the long term the risks are that measures already \nproposed by the Government for sustainable financing of rural road maintenance will not be put in \nplace nationwide, and that DDCs will revert to investing limited funds in new roads rather than \nmaintenance of the existing network. The first risk will be addressed through continuing policy \ndialogue between ADB and the Government. The institutional development TA will address the \nsecond  risk  by  strengthening  DOLIDAR\u2019s  capacity  to  provide  DDCs  with  maintenance \nmanagement  guidance  and  direction  and  to  monitor  rural  road  maintenance  performance \nnationwide. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n57.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  If cofinancing by GTZ and SDC has not been obtained by 28 February 2005, the \nscope  of  rural  transport  and  supplementary  infrastructure  and  their  respective \ncomponents will be reduced.  \n(ii)  The Government will finalize the national policy and strategy on local infrastructure \ndevelopment by 31 December 2004, and the rural infrastructure subsector policy \non gender by 31 August 2005. \n(iii)  The approved annual budget allocations for the Project will be sufficient to cover \nrequired counterpart funding, including resettlement-related payments. \n(iv)  For a district to be eligible for subproject funding, a DTMP must be approved. \n ", "19  \n(v)  Before commencing project activities in any community, DOLIDAR and the DDC \nwill enter into a project agreement, regulating (a) DDC counterpart funding of 10% \nfor  transport  infrastructure,  and  15%  in  kind  from  the  beneficiaries  for \nsupplementary investments; (b) terms and conditions of release of funding from the \nDDC to BGs; (c) establishment and staffing of the DPO; (d) auditing and reporting \nmechanism to PCU; and (e) coordination mechanisms with similar activities under \nother projects in the district. \n(vi)  For works to be undertaken in any community, the DDC and VDC, and VDC and \nBGs will enter into contracts, acceptable in form and substance to ADB, before \nworks  start,  regulating    (a)  provision  of  VDC  contribution;  (b)  minimum \nspecifications and standards of construction works performed by the BGs; (c) \nminimum specifications and standards for maintenance of works to be performed \nby BGs; (d) environmental standards applicable to the design, construction, and \noperation and maintenance of works; and (e) employment terms and conditions for \nBG members, including wage rate and frequency of pay. \n(vii)  Recruitment,  training,  and  deployment  to  villages  of  social  mobilizers  will  be \ninitiated from the beginning of the Project and before construction activities start. \nSocial mobilization contracts will be only with local NGOs that have a track record \nof relevant experience over at least three years. The social mobilization program \nwill facilitate full dissemination of project information to beneficiaries and effective \nparticipation by women, the poor, and disadvantaged groups in project activities. \nDDCs  will  act  upon  the  findings  and  recommendations  from  performance \nmonitoring of social mobilization service delivery in respect of DDCs\u2019 contractual \narrangements with local NGOs. \n(viii)  Selection and approval of subprojects will be in accordance with agreed-on criteria. \nSubprojects will be technically suited for construction using the LEP approach, \nwhich will be used for all road and trail construction.  \n(ix)  Unskilled jobs in subproject BGs will be reserved for beneficiaries living within the \ninfluence  of  the  infrastructure  to  be  constructed.  Workers  will  be  paid  in  full \nfortnightly.  \n(x)  DOLIDAR and participating districts will take all measures to increase rural road \nmaintenance funding to a sustainable level, including by establishing district road \nmaintenance  funds.  The  Project  will  not  finance  new  roads  unless  adequate \nallocations to maintain existing infrastructure have been made. Before 14 April of \neach year during project implementation, DOLIDAR will agree with ADB on the \nannual maintenance program for rural roads in the project districts for the following \nyear. By 14 March of every year DOLIDAR will submit to ADB for review the \nproposed maintenance budget. \n(xi)  DOLIDAR will ensure that gender issues are considered in project implementation, \nwith  respect  to  project  beneficiaries  and  staff  recruited  by  DOLIDAR,  and \nparticipating NGOs and consulting firms, in accordance with the Project\u2019s gender \naction plan. \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that civil-works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws. Bidding documents will include a clause prohibiting child labor for \nconstruction and maintenance, and a clause specifying equal pay for men and \nwomen for work of equal value. Compliance with these provisions will be strictly \nmonitored during project implementation.  \n(xiii)  If involuntary resettlement and land or asset acquisition are required for subprojects \nor supplementary investments, a resettlement plan will be prepared. The DDC will \npublicly  disclose  the  resettlement  plan  in  places  and  using  language \n ", "20   \naccessible  to  all  affected  people.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the approved resettlement framework and ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, and will include a complete census and \ninventory  of  losses.  DOLIDAR  will  not  approve  any  construction  unless  a \nresettlement plan, in form and substance acceptable to ADB, has been submitted \nto and approved by the PCU, DOLIDAR, and ADB. Land acquisition, including \ncompensation payments, will be completed before possession of land and other \nassets, in accordance with the agreed-on resettlement plan.  \n(xiv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  subprojects  will  be  identified,  selected, \nimplemented, and reported in accordance with the environmental procedures and \nrequirements specified in the environmental assessment and review procedure, \nsubproject  IEEs,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and \nnational and local environmental laws and regulations. \n(xv)  Within 9 months of loan effectiveness, the PCU will conduct any required initial \nbaseline  physical  and  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation and monitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. The data \nwill cover income and expenditure, livelihoods, demographic trends, gender issues, \nissues  of  ethnic  and  minority  groups,  nutritional  status,  child  labor,  and \nenvironmental issues. Within nine months of loan effectiveness, the PCU will have \nestablished a gender-segregated project performance monitoring system.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n(i)  A first-year work plan for the Project will have been prepared and submitted for \nADB approval. \n(ii)  The Government will have opened a project account at the Nepal Rastra Bank. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n58.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 27,328,000 to the Kingdom of Nepal for the \nDecentralized Rural Infrastructure and Livelihood Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n                  Tadao Chino \n  President \n \n1 September 2004   \n ", "Appendix 1          21   \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  Strategic Road Network. The development of the strategic road network (SRN) has \nlong been a government priority, resulting in around 3,000 kilometers (km) of national highways \nproviding the main strategic connections nationwide, and nearly 2,000 km of feeder roads \nconnecting highways to regional and district headquarters and to major economic centers, all \nunder the responsibility of the Department of Roads (DOR). All 20 district headquarters on the \nplains are connected to the SRN, and within about 2 years all but five of the hill and mountain \ndistrict centers will be connected, assuming committed programs are fulfilled. The SRN forms \nthe national network from which the local transport infrastructure system extends within the \ndistricts. \n \n2.  Rural Roads. A system of rural roads and trails provides access to rural areas from \nadministrative centers and the SRN. In the last two decades efforts have increased to build rural \nroads to the hills, including initiatives by local authorities (district development committees [DDCs] \nand village development committees [VDCs]); and government agencies such as DOR, Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Cooperatives,  and,  more  recently,  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR), using national resources, and through external \nfunding agency-assisted projects. DOLIDAR has designated two categories of rural road. District \nroads are within a district and connect more than one VDC or important economic facilities such \nas  markets and tourism centers to the district headquarters, either directly or via the SRN. \nTypically these roads carry little or no through traffic and are owned by the DDC. Village roads are \nshort, no-through roads linking VDCs to an economic facility or to a higher class of road to provide \naccess to the district center. These roads are owned by the VDCs. The latest government figures \nsuggest that the country has about 6,600 kms of district roads, two thirds of which are earthen, \nand a maximum of perhaps 4,000 km of earthen trafficable village roads. \n \n3.  Trails and Footbridges. Significant efforts have been made to develop local transport \ninfrastructure in the hills and mountains by constructing, or improving existing, nonmotorable \ntrails and footbridges. Government investments to provide improved trails and bridges have \nbeen supplemented by external agency financing over many years, including integrated rural \ndevelopment programs. Accurate data are not readily available, but some 130,000 km of main \ntrails are estimated to have been built or rehabilitated, and at least 900 suspension bridges \nhave been constructed nationwide.  \n \n4.  The Labor-Based, Environmentally Friendly, and Participatory Approach to Rural \nRoad Construction. The \u201cgreen roads\u201d approach was originally developed in Nepal under a \nprogram financed by the Government of Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit \n(GTZ).  DOLIDAR  has  adopted  the  approach,  formalizing  it  as  labor-based,  environmentally \nfriendly, and participatory (LEP). It is intended to (i) employ local people, rather than use heavy \nequipment, to build roads; (ii) apply design and construction methods that minimize the damage \nto, and where possible, enhance the fragile physical environment in hill areas; and (iii) incorporate \nlocal interests and opinions in the planning, design, implementation, and management of rural \nroad infrastructure. The LEP approach is in stark contrast to uncontrolled rural road construction \nthat  continues  to  be  practiced  by  local  authorities.  Often  unplanned,  badly  excavated, \nunmaintainable  (and  frequently  impassable)  earth  tracks  are  constructed  with  bulldozers, \nsignificantly damaging the environment. \n \n ", "22          Appendix 1 \n5.  Rural  Road  Maintenance.  Funding  to  maintain  rural  roads  is  inadequate.  The \nGovernment must ensure that it is increased to sustain existing and new rural road infrastructure \nin the long term. In December 2002 the Government established an independent Road Board with \na separate Road Fund for maintenance. The board must allocate about 30% of the fund\u2019s annual \ndisbursements to roads owned by DDCs, municipalities, and VDCs, which must provide 25% in \nmatching funds. However, DDCs lack the funds to implement DOLIDAR\u2019s National Plan for Rural \nRoad Maintenance (2000), and, in any case, many districts still have inadequate capacity to \nundertake  satisfactory  maintenance  management.  Therefore,  while  maintenance  of  strategic \nroads has improved, DOLIDAR, the Road Board, DDCs, and VDCs must prioritize adequate \nmaintenance of the rapidly expanding network of rural roads for several years to ensure that local \nbodies maintain rural roads. Before central funds are allocated for new construction projects, strict \nguidelines are required in plans and programs for DDCs to demonstrate that they can manage \nexisting infrastructure in a sustainable manner. The proportions of funding made available by \nDDCs must be shifted to increase allocations to maintenance budget lines and decrease amounts \nfor new development. Finally, areas from which local bodies are permitted to raise significant \nrevenue must be increased. These actions are consistent with national and district policies. The \nProject will support the planning and actions required to improve maintenance planning, financing, \nand implementation. A related institutional development technical assistance (TA) grant will help \nDOLIDAR  develop  an  institutional  culture  and  workable  strategy  to  support  rural  road \nmaintenance. The TA will also help the Project strengthen district-level capacity to undertake \nmaintenance (Appendix 9). \n \nB.  National Subsector Policy and Strategy Framework \n \n6.  National Strategy for Rural Infrastructure Development. Issued in 1997, the strategy is \nderived from and supports the aims of the Agriculture Perspective Plan, and is consistent with the \nnational policy of decentralization. The strategy sets out the objectives for rural infrastructure \ndevelopment. The strategy led to the creation of DOLIDAR and has largely achieved several \nstrategy objectives. However, others have not been addressed, and the strategy is vague about its \ngoal the development of basic rural infrastructur).  \n \n7.  Decentralization Policy. In 1999 the Government approved the Local Self-Governance \nAct (LSGA), following the strategy of the Ninth Five-Year (1997-2002) and Tenth Five-Year (2002-\n2007) Plans. The LSGA gives DDCs responsibility for local infrastructure. Certain responsibilities \nfor local infrastructure are devolved further to VDCs. All DDCs receive an annual block grant from \nthe  Government  for  administrative  and  development  expenditures,  and  a  proportion  of  the \ndevelopment grant is allocated for rural roads. All VDCs receive an equal annual grant from the \nGovernment, part of which should be spent on local infrastructure. These devolved responsibilities \nprovide the framework for projects to work with districts as a focus for activities, and to achieve \nbetter equity of resource distribution by adopting more participatory approaches, and incorporating \nmeasures to improve local governance. \n \n8.  National Policy and Strategy for Local Infrastructure Development. The Government \nis finalizing a national policy and strategy for local infrastructure development to update the 1997 \nstrategy  to  be  consistent  with  the  decentralization  policy.  The  policy  aims  to  support  and \naccelerate sustainable development of local infrastructure in the spirit of the LSGA and the \nprinciple of devolution of power, through plans for pro-poor development. The policy advocates \ngradual handing over of infrastructure ownership to local bodies, giving DDCs control over VDCs \nand municipalities, and improving procedures.  \n  \n \n ", "Appendix 1          23   \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n9.  Past rural infrastructure projects experienced some problems, and the lessons learned \nhave been incorporated into the project design. The Asian Development Bank-funded Rural \nInfrastructure Development Project was studied in the greatest depth. It has built significant \nphysical infrastructure, but problems have occurred regarding the cost and sustainability of \nproject roads, and lack of targeting of poor local people for construction jobs. Some of the most \nimportant lessons learned in the subsector are in Table A1. A key lesson is that often the pro-\npoor objectives of projects are not prioritized during implementation, and local elites benefit \ndisproportionately  from  infrastructure  investments.  Therefore,  the  design  of  recent  rural \ninfrastructure  projects  of  other  development  partners,  and  the  Project  emphasize  careful \ntargeting of the poor and disadvantaged to ensure that they are prioritized to become members \nof building groups (BGs), and benefit from community development, livelihood interventions, \nand rural infrastructure. \n \nTable A1: Key Lessons Learned from the Rural Infrastructure Development Project \n \nIssue  Lesson  Rationale \nCompliance with the pro-poor aims of  Investments must conform to rigorous  Strong political pressure exists to use \nthe Project.  selection and feasibility criteria, and be  contracting systems that do not deliver \nmonitored to ensure compliance with  the key benefits and, in some cases, \nagreed-on project objectives  appear linked to resource leakage. \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \nConstruction methodology and  Intensive supervision is needed to  Workers are unskilled and engineering \nsafeguarding of project benefits.  ensure quality of works through the  design is finalized during construction. \nlabor-based, environmentally friendly,  Ensuring safeguards for poor laborers \nand participatory construction  and avoiding benefit capture by elites \napproach.   require careful controls. \nMaintenance and sustainability of  New infrastructure will only be properly  DDCs have inadequate skills and \ndistrict-owned infrastructure.  maintained if specific capacity support  capacity for maintenance, and political \nis directed to district development  pressure is strong for new construction \ncommittees (DDCs).   rather than maintenance. \nSelection of subprojects for funding.

Institutional Framework of the Rural Infrastructure Subsector \n \n10.  Overview.  Although  an  institutional  framework  exists  that  makes  infrastructure \ndevelopment appear straightforward through management by DDCs and supply of services by \nprivate sector companies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), organizations operating at \nthe district level have their weaknesses. These issues exist within a well-structured framework, \nwhere planning processes are laid out in various legal provisions, funding systems are in place \nthat give considerable control to the local bodies, and procurement procedures are extensively \ndocumented in the Government\u2019s Public Works Directives (2002).1 Subprojects are identified from \nthe district transport master plans, which are prepared based on suggestions put forward by VDCs \nand  communities.  VDCs  make  their  recommendations  after  community  needs  are  identified \nthrough consultative meetings according to the decentralized government planning process. The \nproject  design  recognizes  that  these  local  consultative  meetings  may  not  necessarily  be \nrepresentative, hence the need for the Project\u2019s community development component. The aim is \nto enable all community groups to participate and articulate their preferences and improve their \ninvolvement in community decision making. This program is long term in implementation and \nimpact and operates in parallel with subproject selection. While the community development \ncomponent will enhance subproject decision making, the component\u2019s intended impact will be to \nimprove all forms of community decision making and participation. \n \n11.  Coordination of Rural Infrastructure. Guidelines, procedures, and technical support for \nrural  infrastructure  development  and  management  are  responsibilities  of  DOLIDAR.  A  new \ndepartment, it has concentrated on transport planning and coordinating rural road construction \nand maintenance, preparing manuals and guidelines, and centrally managing external funding \nagency and government-financed programs. With the establishment of the Road Board and its \nRoad Fund, DOLIDAR is also now responsible for coordinating local bodies\u2019 road maintenance \nplans and consolidating them into a nationwide annual road maintenance plan. The Project will \nsupport DOLIDAR in all these activities through the institutional development TA. DOLIDAR\u2019s \nsupport from the center to each district is focused on the district technical offices (DTOs).  \n \n12.  Local Government Capacity. Rural infrastructure is owned, depending on the class of \nroad, by DDCs and VDCs. VDCs need substantial capacity building to allow them to build, \noperate, and maintain infrastructure on any scale. The 75 DDCs have greater resources than the \nVDCs, including DTOs. While some DTOs are not fully staffed, they do have a professional \nengineer, supported by a technical team. DDCs and VDCs responsible for local infrastructure \ndevelopment suffer several constraints, including (i) a lack of funds, staff, and logistics resources; \n(ii)  lack  of  organizational  clarity,  since  who  should  take  responsibility  for  many  activities  is \nuncertain; (iii) operational difficulties because of conflicts between more than 20 sectoral acts and \nthe LSGA provisions; (iv) lack of coordination of development activities among the DDCs, central \ngovernment line agencies, and NGOs; (v) limited commitment to, or conceptual clarity in, rational \nplanning for efficient use of scarce resources, with decisions often made to deal with crises and to \nmeet distributional and political imperatives; (vi) lack of participation, and of attention to awareness \nraising  among  the  people;  (vii)  limited  transparency  and  accountability;  and  (viii)  lack  of \nsupervision and monitoring skills and capacity, and little interest in critical evaluation. The Project \nincludes a considerable element of training and capacity building to help tackle these problems. \n \n13.  Private  Sector  Consulting  Company  Capacity.  Local  consultants  tend  to  operate \nnationally,  mostly  from  Kathmandu.  Many  employ  engineers  with  a  considerable  range  of \n                                                 \n1 Government of Nepal. 2002. Public Works Directives. Kathmandu \n ", "Appendix 1          25   \nqualifications and skills, yet output standards are often lower than satisfactory due to some or all of \nthe following: (i) a poorly developed concept of professionalism in the engineering sector; (ii) a \nculture that assumes that, once trained, individuals do not need to update their skills; (iii) a lack of \nappropriate technical skills for low-cost engineering approaches; (iv) a reliance on overdesigned \nand expensive structures to compensate for uncertainties and recriminations if low-cost structures \nfail; (v) conflicting messages from successive changes of approach between different projects; (vi) \nlack of managerial supervision; (vii) an overdeveloped interest in company profits above technical \nissues, frequently leading to poor terms of employment and late salary payments to site staff, and \na reluctance to employ staff between contracts, leading to rapid staff turnover and lack of loyalty; \nand  (viii)  the  effects  of  corruption  in  the  institutional  environment,  leading  to  cynicism  and \ndemoralization as to the role of sound engineering practices. Used for many district technical \nworks, consultants will be provided with intensive training and guidance by the central project \nimplementation consultant. \n \n14.  Local  Nongovernment  Organization  Capacity.  A  large  number  of  local  NGOs  are \nregistered, with objectives ranging from community development to those more business oriented. \nLocal NGOs face a number of constraints, including (i) lack of skills in social interaction and \nmobilization; (ii) political leanings that exclude many potential beneficiaries; (iii) overreliance on \nideological approaches to development that do not take practical factors into account; (iv) lack of \ncontinuity in work, leading to cash-flow problems and the need to lay off staff between contracts; \n(v)  lack  of  managerial  supervision;  (vi)  lack  of  skills  in  financial  management,  and  poor \ngovernment regulation that permits weak corporate control to go unchecked; and (vii) inability to \nresist pressure from the corrupt institutional environment, leading to biased operations. The central \nproject implementation consultant will address these problems through training and guidance. \n \nE.  Financial Management \n \n15.  During project implementation, financial management begins with preparation of an annual \nwork program and budget. This originates in the districts but is consolidated (in the case of the \nProject) by the project coordination unit. The annual budget program is submitted to the Ministry of \nLocal Development, National Planning Commission, and Ministry of Finance before approval by \nParliament. Approval is followed by authority to spend, which is given, in turn, by the secretaries of \nfinance and local development, and by the director general of DOLIDAR. Budget release is \nsignificantly delayed every year.  \n \n16.  Timely payment to BGs is important, as they are composed of the poorest laborers. The \non-site  presence  of  project  staff  from  the  district  project  office  will  help  facilitate  prompt \nmeasurement of completed works and preparation of payment claims. However, in practice the \ntime taken to check and authorize these payments, issue checks, and complete payments to \nlaborers means that a fortnightly schedule cannot be met other than in exceptional cases. To \novercome this problem, a system of advances and running bills must be used to ensure that \nlaborers receive their wages without delay.  \n ", "26          Appendix 2 \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO

Overview of Project Concept \n \n1.  The concepts used in the project design are based on the premise, widely proven in Nepal, \nthat physical infrastructure alone is not enough to significantly reduce poverty. While access is a \nprerequisite for sustainable improvements in the livelihoods of the poor, specific measures must \nbe taken to ensure that interventions immediately ameliorate the living conditions of the most \nmarginalized sections of society, restore incomes and community infrastructure affected by the \nconflict, and are then translated into long-term, lasting changes to assets, be they financial, social, \nor other capital. This approach can be simply demonstrated by means of the three main project \ncomponents. The project design ensures that the three components are integrally linked to enable \nthe  infrastructure  investments  to  be  used  as  a  sustainable,  long-term  approach  to  poverty \nreduction.  \n \n2.  Community Development and Rural Livelihood Restoration. The inequalities in rural \ncommunities have led to the widespread failure of disadvantaged groups to benefit from previous \ntop-down interventions that have been captured by a small but relatively wealthy elite, except for \nsome trickle-down benefits, one of the causes of the conflict in Nepal. The Project will reduce \npoverty by raising awareness of rights and opportunities among all parts of the communities, and \nensuring that project interventions provide direct practical support for the poorest groups. The \nProject will use a coordinated, intensive, and wide-reaching series of social mobilization actions so \npeople can build assets, revise livelihood strategies, and have a secure and sustainable existence. \n \n3.  Capacity Building and Decentralized Local Governance. As decentralization continues \n(paras. 8-10), the Project will seek to build the capacity, and clearly define the appropriate level of \nauthority, of local government institutions to enable them to perform their functions efficiently, and \nto operate as effective, accountable service providers. Central institutions are not adapted to a \nmodern governance role as facilitators and regulators of development activities. The Project will \nseek to reform and build new capacity in the Department of Local Infrastructure Development and \nAgricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) to facilitate and regulate the rural road sector. \n \n4.  Rural Transport Infrastructure. This component will depart from the traditional approach \nused in previous rural infrastructure interventions. Supported by the community development and \ncapacity-building components, the component will be used to promote community development by \nfinancing  subprojects  to  construct  new,  or  rehabilitate  existing,  rural  transport  infrastructure \nplanned using a participatory approach, and built by employing local poor people in labor-based \nconstruction that uses environmentally sound techniques. Long-term livelihood enhancement and \nincome    restoration  depends  on  all  of  these  elements  being  followed,  and  subsequent \nsustainability requires establishment of a maintenance management system based on the same \napproach. \n \n5.  Process Approach. The rural transport infrastructure component cannot be achieved \nthrough a prescriptive list of interventions. A process approach will be used that allows the districts \nto select subprojects through participatory planning mechanisms, and, within the subproject areas, \nallows the beneficiary communities to select and design supplementary investments in social and \neconomic infrastructure that, combined with the social mobilization activities, will enable people to \nbetter access services and markets. \n \n ", "Appendix 4          33   \n6.  Appropriate  Planning  and  Construction  Approach.  All  project  infrastructure \ndevelopment is based on participatory planning and the use of labor-based construction methods \nthat specifically include poor and disadvantaged people. The designs and techniques are also \nenvironmentally  sound,  based  on  the  experience  of  previous  projects  such  as  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Rural Infrastructure Development Project, which had problems related \nto poor works quality and governance. Special project measures are required to ensure that the \npoor derive the benefits due to them. \n \n7.  Involvement of Nongovernment Organizations. The Project will prioritize the use of \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) in raising stakeholder awareness during implementation; \nmobilizing  building  groups;  delivering  social  development  interventions;  ensuring  delivery  of \nbenefits, including wages; and guaranteeing gender equality. Community-based organizations, \nwhich are generally accepted by the insurgents, will also be used in relation to supplementary \ninvestments. Some district development committees (DDCs) implementing project works have little \nexperience in this approach, although experience is widespread nationally from similar projects. \nConsulting services engaged by DOLIDAR will provide training and capacity building to the DDCs \nand to the NGOs they engage, in line with standard procedures and recognized best practice. This \ndouble approach has been found to be essential in tapping the resources offered by NGOs, which \nprovide a valuable complement to the services of traditional government line agencies. \n \nB.  Link with Decentralization \n \n8.  The Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) of 1999 and its supporting regulations provide a \nsound framework for decentralized local government. However, despite this legislative provision \nand  the  activities  of  high-level  committees,  decentralization  is  proceeding  slowly. \nResponsibilities and resources have not been transferred to local levels, and transparency has \nnot yet been increased. One practical issue that constrains progress is the conflict between \nLSGA  provisions  and  more  than  20  other  acts.  Decentralized  responsibility  exceeds  the \nauthority given to local government bodies. Local and central institutions duplicate each others\u2019 \nfunctions.  \n \n9.  For LSGA provisions to be effective, DDCs and central line agencies must coordinate well, \nwith DDCs\u2019 priorities taking precedence in allocation of centrally managed resources. This change \nis taking considerable time to implement, although the establishment of the district technical \noffices (DTOs), answerable to the DDCs, is an important step forward. The creation and operation \nof DOLIDAR and the implementation of the district transport master planning process mean that \nthe  rural  infrastructure  sector  is  more  advanced  than  most  other  sectors  in  the  transfer  of \nresponsibility and authority to the DDCs and village development committees.  \n \n10.  Unless  they  have  greater  control  over  financial  resources  than  they  do  now,  local \ngovernment bodies, particularly DDCs, will have difficulty implementing LSGA provisions. Little \nincentive exists for participatory, local-level planning while DDCs lack the resources to implement \nthe plans. The authority to open sectoral offices and hire professional staff means little while DDCs \ncannot finance this additional capacity. Project support of the nature proposed under the capacity-\nbuilding and decentralized governance component (para. 3) therefore provides a basis for DDCs \nto  undertake  the  entire  decentralized  approach  with  adequate  funding.  Coupled  with  the \ncommunity  development  component,  the  capacity  building  component  enables  DTOs  to  be \nstrengthened, with immediate and lasting benefits to the poor. \n \n \n \n ", "34         Appendix 4 \nC.  Project Area \n \n11.  The final number of participating districts was assessed by balancing the aim of reaching \nthe largest number of beneficiaries over as wide an area as possible, and attempting to remain \nactively  engaged  in  conflict-affected  districts,  against  considerations  of  ensuring  that  project \nimplementation is manageable and that sufficient funds are invested in each district to achieve a \nsignificant  impact.  The  criteria  applied  in  selecting  the  project  districts  were  (i)  extent  and \ncharacteristics  of  poverty,  impact  of  the  conflict  in  the  district,  population,  and  agricultural \ncharacteristics and potential; (ii) level of access to the districts provided by the strategic road \nnetwork, level of provision of road access within districts, and planning benefits in clustering \nproject districts; (iii) complementarity with other projects in the districts, continuity in the ADB \ncountry program, and absorptive capacity constraints at district level; and (iv) district capacity and \nperformance. \n \n12.  Based on the findings, the Government and ADB have agreed on 18 districts, all extremely \npoor by standard poverty indicators (Appendix 11) and with severe access constraints, including \nthe Far Western districts of Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula; the Midwestern region districts \nof Dolpa, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla, Kalikot, and Mugu; the Western region districts of Baglung, \nGorkha, Lamjung, and Myagdi; and the Central and Eastern region districts of Okhaldhunga, \nRamechhap, Solukhumbu, and Taplejung.   \n \n \n13.  Within the selected districts, project funds will be allocated in two phases through a series \nof subprojects. DDCs will be required to bid for these, following guidelines of eligibility, although \nfunds should be spread between all districts, with the four poorest receiving about 20% more than \nthe others. All subprojects must be small and included as priority elements of the district transport \nmaster  plan.  For  example,  a  new  district  road  will  be  about  20  kilometers  (km)  at  most. \nSubprojects must extend the connectivity of the existing network, be owned by the DDC, and not \nimpinge on any environmentally sensitive area. These conditions are required to ensure cost-\neffectiveness and meet the Project\u2019s development objectives, particularly with respect to job \ncreation. Detailed feasibility studies will ensure that subprojects are viable. A second series of \nsubprojects  will  be  funded  in  the  second  phase,  released  two  years  after  the  first  funding \nallocation. This phase involve the same eligibility criteria as for the first phase, but performance \ntests will also be added, among others related to compliance with selection criteria; extent and \ntimeliness  of  land  compensation;  and  timeliness,  quality,  and  effectiveness  of  rural  road \nmaintenance and subproject implementation. \n \nD.  Infrastructure Specifications \n \n14.  The Project will support building rural infrastructure to nationally approved standards \n(Supplementary Appendix F). A modified form of the \u201cgreen road concept\u201d will be applied, as \ndeveloped by DOLIDAR in partnership with various external funding agencies. This concept \nuses a widely known and proven approach of phased construction over 3\u20134 years. All works are \nlabor-based, using methods that require only limited construction skills, such as bioengineering \nand gabions. The approach is environmentally sound since it minimizes disruption to hill slopes, \nand  balances  cut  and  fill.  Participatory  planning  is  used  to  select  subprojects  and \nsupplementary investments. DOLIDAR refers to the approach as labor-based, environmentally \nfriendly, and participatory (LEP). Safety standards (audits) will be incorporated into project \ndesigns, and DTO staff trained as required.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4          35   \nE.  Working in the Conflict Environment \n \n15.  Because of the insurgency, the most immediate project risk is that carrying out activities \nwill be unsafe or impractical. How the conflict will unfold is unpredictable, so violence, fear, and \ninsecurity must be addressed as part of the working environment.  \n \n16.  The continuation of the conflict increases the need to implement the Project so that it can \nhelp address the causes of the conflict\u2014continuing poverty and social exclusion; lack of rural \nfacilities, infrastructure, services, and opportunities; lack of participation and accountability in \nresource  use;  and  diversion  of  resources  away  from  the  poor.  Similar  projects  in  the  rural \ninfrastructure subsector and other sectors have been able to continue and even to start in new \nareas during the conflict, without being seriously hindered by the insurgents.1 A small number of \nincidents where work was hampered were only temporary.  \n \n17.  Given the project objectives, the situation is likely to remain as it is now and the Project to \noperate relatively unhindered. However, the security situation changes frequently and is location \nspecific. Regular monitoring will therefore be required (para. 20). Some projects have been most \neasily able to continue where they are already well known. To continue, the projects need to \nmaintain an informal dialogue with the insurgents; focus on activities with a direct, visible, and \nrapid  developmental  and  employment  impact  (construction  of  infrastructure  and  income \nrestoration, for example, rather than conduct of workshops); and heed periodic advice to avoid \ncertain areas. Transparency in implementation is also an important risk-mitigation strategy. \n \n18.  The Project can achieve quick recognition in two ways. One is to enter into partnerships \nwith  ongoing  projects,  which  will  facilitate  implementation  since  these  are  well  known  and \nestablished at the local level, and recognized as doing valuable work. In practice this means \nlinkages  with  the  District  Road  Support  Program  in  the  Central  and  Eastern  districts  of \nOkhaldhunga and Ramechhap, and with the Rural Community Infrastructure Works Programme in \nthe Far Western districts of Baitadi, Bajhang, Bajura, and Darchula. For the other districts, where \npartnership agreements may not be possible, the second way is to begin activities carefully, \nstarting  modestly  and  expanding  the  Project\u2019s  presence gradually, in close consultation and \ndialogue with all concerned parties. This will allow the development of operational procedures that \nare practical, acceptable, and safe in a conflict situation, and that will develop the confidence of all \nlocal stakeholders, including those directly involved in the conflict. \n \n19.  Working in a conflict environment inevitably implies an element of risk to the safety of the \nindividuals involved, combined with risks of loss of project property and funds, and even of the \ninfrastructure  that  is  built.  These  risks  must  clearly  be  judged  acceptable  for the Project to \nproceed, but also imply (i) the importance of monitoring the security and risk situation in all project \ndistricts; (ii) the need to train all project field staff to be effective in a conflict situation, and to \nhandle risk situations where staff safety is under threat; and (iii) the need for contingency plans to \nevacuate field staff promptly if the security risk becomes unacceptable. In the context of an \nevolving conflict situation, changing strategies of the Government and those leading the conflict, \nand  poor  communications  in  the  field,  the  risk  is  real  and  immediate  that  institutional  and \n                                                 \n1 For example, the Rural Community Infrastructure Works Programme, a government initiative supported by seven \nexternal funding agencies, has been active in 30 districts, including many of those most heavily affected by conflict. \nThe Rural Access Programme, funded by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, has \nestablished operations in two new conflict-affected districts and has been working through other projects in a further \nfour districts. \n \n ", "36         Appendix 4 \nimplementation arrangements might prove inappropriate in any particular place or time. The \nproject  strategy  will  be  to  consider  alternative  arrangements  as  needs  dictate.  The  Project \ntherefore needs to be flexible and proactive in regularly assessing the validity and applicability of \nproject implementation arrangements, and revising them according to location as circumstances \ndictate. \n \nF.  Safeguards to Ensure Poverty Reduction \n \n20.  The Government will ensure that all project road and trail construction works use the LEP \napproach of (i) employing unskilled labor instead of using construction equipment; (ii) applying \ndesign and construction methods that protect the physical environment; and (iii) incorporating local \ninterests and opinions in works planning, design, and implementation. The LEP approach will (i) \nphase construction of roads over 3 years, (ii) emphasize the careful selection of the horizontal and \nlongitudinal alignment close to the surface of the hill slope, (iii) aim to balance cut and fill, (iv) build \nstructures based on needs determined on-site and using the lowest-cost option that meets the \nrequirement, and (v) integrate the use of vegetation as bioengineering to ensure slope protection \nand shallow stabilization.  The Government must also ensure that (i) all unskilled labor employed \non subproject construction works is drawn from within the district, (ii) 40% of all the unskilled jobs \nare reserved for women where demand is sufficient, (iii) laborers receive their full wage based on \nthe work norms for completed tasks, (iv) equal pay is given for equal work, (v) no one under 14 \nyears old is employed, and (vi) employment conditions for unskilled laborers include provision for a \nsavings component. \n ", "   \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AN  D FINANCING PLAN\n \n \n \n \nTable A5.1: Project Cost Summary, by Componenta \n   \n    % % Total\n    (NRe Million) (US$ Million) Foreign Base\nItem Local Foreign Total Local Foreign Total Exchange Costs\nCommunity Development and Rural Livelihood Restoration 1,095.6 15.3 1,110.8 14.4 0.2 14.6 1 28\nCapacity Building and Decentralized Governance 87.4 10.5 97.9 1.1 0.1 1.3 11 2\nRural Transport Infrastructure 2,285.7 95.3 2,381.0 30.1 1.3 31.3 4 60\nProject Management Services 243.2 162.0 405.2 3.2 2.1 5.3 40 10\nTotal Baseline Costs 3,711.9 283.0 3,994.9 48.8 3.7 52.6 7 100\nPhysical Contingencies 310.9 12.0 322.9 4.1 0.2 4.2 4 8\nPrice Contingencies 307.0 18.2 325.2 4.0 0.2 4.3 6 8\nTotal Project Costs 4,329.7 313.2 4,643.0 57.0 4.1 61.1 7 116\nInterest During Implementation 0.0 93.1 93.1 0.0 1.2 1.2 100 2\nTotal Costs to be Financed 4,329.7 406.3 4,736.0 57.0 5.3 62.3 9 119\na Figures may not add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n  5\n         3\n7\n ", "   \n \nTable A5.2: Project Cost Summary, by Expenditure Accounta \n3\n8\n        ADB GoveNrnepmaelnt of SDC GTZ Local GovernmentBeneficiaries Total            A\nItem $ million % $ million % $ million % $ million % $ million % $ million % $ million % p\np\ne\nI.

Background \n \n1.  The Project requires high input of consulting and nongovernment organization (NGO) \nservices.  The  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure  Development  and  Agricultural  Roads \n(DOLIDAR) has rapidly accumulated experience in managing external funding agency-financed \nrural infrastructure projects, but project implementation will be complex, and DOLIDAR\u2019s human \nresource capacity is limited. District institutional capacities are also limited. Consultant and NGO \ninputs are needed to (i) provide DOLIDAR with the management and advisory support and \ncapacity to execute the Project; (ii) undertake a broad range of tasks under contract to the \nimplementing agencies to strengthen district capacity; (iii) develop local NGO capacity in staff-\nintensive  social  mobilization  activities;  and  (iv)  ensure  proper  implementation  of  the  labor-\nbased,  environmentally  friendly,  and  participatory  (LEP)  construction  approach  to  cost-\neffectively achieve the required standards and quality. These inputs, which include a major \ntraining program, are essential if the Project is to achieve its social, institutional, and physical \nobjectives, and to (i) help DOLIDAR and district agencies become modern, efficient institutions \nthat contract out much of their work but are able to manage effectively the services provided; \nand  (ii)  help  the  private  and  NGO  sectors  become  capable  of  providing  consistent,  high-\nstandard service upon which central and local government institutions can rely. The TA will be \nfinanced from the loan and co-financiers. \n \nB.  Central Consulting Services \n \n2.  At the central level, consultants will provide advisory support, specialized expertise, and \nadditional  professional  staff  capacity  needed  by  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  to \ncomplement DOLIDAR\u2019s skills to execute and manage the Project. These services will be \nprovided primarily by the central project implementation consultant, combining international and \ndomestic inputs. International inputs are required to overcome limitations in capacities and \ncapabilities within Nepal, and to apply international experience and best practices to project \nimplementation. DOLIDAR will contract separately for national NGO social consultant services. \nDOLIDAR  is  also  expected  to  contract  separately  with  domestic  individual  consultants  or \ninstitutions to carry out specific training, performance monitoring, environmental, and evaluation \nactivities. \n \n3.  The  central  project  implementation  consultant  services  will  be  provided  by  an \nassociation of international and domestic firms selected and engaged on an internationally \ncompetitive basis using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure, in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers  and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total of about \n90 person-months of international and 425 person-months of domestic expertise are required.1 \nNational NGO services to support social mobilization will be engaged from among qualified \nNGOs in Nepal. \n \n4.  The  services  to  be  provided  include  (i)  project  management,  including  subproject \nselection,  budget  and  works  planning,  procurement,  administration,  and  monitoring  and \nreporting;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building  and  training  in  all  administrative  and  technical \naspects  of  the  project  approaches;  (iii)  social  mobilization  and  social  development;  (iv) \nparticipatory  planning;  (v)  aspects  of  technical  engineering  for  the  LEP  approach;  (vi) \n                                                 \n1 If suitably qualified domestic consultants are available, they may be substituted for international consultants. \n ", "Appendix 8           43   \nenvironmental  management  and  compliance  with  initial  environmental  examination \nrecommendations and safeguards; (vii) impact evaluation of project benefits identified through \nthe project performance and monitoring system; and (viii) monitoring of critical components of \nsite implementation, including works quality and social safeguards.

District-Level Consulting Services \n \n5.  The district development committees that will be the implementing agencies, and their \ndistrict technical offices (DTOs), have limited resources and capacities. District-level services \nare to provide social and technical inputs for awareness raising, participation, mobilization of \nbeneficiaries,  and  social  development;  and  for  planning,  engineering  design,  construction \nsupervision, measurement, and quality control of subprojects and supplementary investments. \nEach DTO will contract with a domestic engineering consulting firm and a local NGO to help \nprovide these services.  \n \n6.  The detailed arrangements for engagement of district-level services will be finalized at \nthe start of implementation and set out in the project procedures manual. DOLIDAR, with the \nassistance of the central project implementation consultant, will prepare and update a register of \ndomestic consulting firms that have prequalified to provide the engineering services after being \ntrained in the LEP approach. DTOs will invite registered firms to bid to provide the services, \nunder  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  national-level  NGO  and  the  central  project \nimplementation consultant will help DOLIDAR identify, for each district, a shortlist of local NGOs \ncapable of providing social services to the DTO. Where possible each DTO will contract with \none qualified local NGO on the basis of competitive procedures. Where qualified local NGOs \nare scarce, direct selection may be applied with prior ADB approval. \n \n7.  Procedures to engage national and local NGO services may be modified for some \ndistricts where partnership or cofinancing arrangements are agreed on with other projects and \nexternal funding agencies to allow direct selection. The approach will allow the Project to exploit \nthe existing social mobilization capacities developed under partner programs. For competitive \n ", "44            Appendix 8 \nselection of the national and local NGOs, priority must be given to their capability and capacity \nto undertake the tasks assigned.  \n ", "Appendix 9          45           \nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT  \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Department for Local Infrastructure Development and Agricultural Roads (DOLIDAR) \nwas conceived as a small agency to provide central coordination, guidance, regulation, and \nmanagement of the sector, with the district development committees (DDCs) supported by the \ndistrict technical offices (DTOs), and the village development committees, directly responsible for \nrural infrastructure planning, implementation, and maintenance. When DOLIDAR was established, \nconfusion as to the nature of the organization required resulted in overlapping of functions such as \nplanning, monitoring, and evaluation with those of the parent Ministry of Local Development \n(MLD). As the Government streamlines the public sector, however, civil service numbers have \nbeen controlled and reduced. The full staffing complement allocated to DOLIDAR has, as yet, \nnever been assigned, either at the center or in the districts (for example, some districts still lack a \ndistrict engineer).  \n \n2.  Private sector support provided to the public sector for rural infrastructure development is \nweak. Despite their involvement in numerous projects, the many local consulting firms are passive \nin providing services, lacking attention to quality, professionalism, and performance management. \nPrivate sector skills in social mobilization are weak, and most of the numerous local and many \nnational nongovernment organizations (NGOs) produce substandard output. \n \n3.  DOLIDAR faces institutional constraints and weaknesses in meeting the demands on it, \nwith  the  increasing  priority  given  to  rural  infrastructure.  Shortage  of  staff,  vagueness  about \nfunctions, and the uncertainty of incomplete decentralization are manifested in, for example, (i) \nlimited monitoring implementation, (ii) difficulties in meeting the differing needs of development \npartners  and  in  assuming  full  government  management  authority  and  coordination  of  rural \ninfrastructure investment programs, (iii) slow progress in generating district transport master plans \n(DTMPs) for all districts, and (iv) limited adoption by local government authorities of sustainable \nrural road maintenance practices or coordination of road network maintenance priorities.  \n \n4.  Decentralization  has  provided  an  additional  opportunity  for  DOLIDAR  to  evolve  as  a \nmodern, regulatory government institution, providing direction to DDCs in planning and to DTOs in \nproject implementation. So far, the process is incomplete, and the lack of revised local government \nstaffing  policies  and  fiscal  systems  have  particularly  constrained  progress.  Nonetheless, \ndecentralization  involves  major  restructuring  of  the  sector  and  the  framework  within  which \nDOLIDAR must evolve. \n \n5.  A national policy and strategy on local infrastructure development is being finalized. Many \nelements of the previous 1997 strategy have either been completed or superseded, leaving \nDOLIDAR without a guiding policy. Institutional development technical assistance (TA), therefore, \ncan help DOLIDAR develop its new role and adopt and implement the revised policy. \n \n6.  The policy was drafted in light of the 1999 legislation to promote decentralization in \nmanaging public resources, and considers the phased devolution of local infrastructure ownership \nto local bodies. The policy also supports the Tenth Five-Year Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper, which is based on poverty reduction; and the Agriculture Perspective Plan, which promotes \nagriculture as the basis of rural economic development. The policy broadens the mandate for rural \ninfrastructure  to  include  all  forms  of  infrastructure,  whereas  the  1997  national  strategy  was \nconcerned mainly with roads, and emphasizes technical audits to control public works quality. The \n ", "46           Appendix 9 \npolicy may require a partial or total restructuring of DOLIDAR, depending on how MLD implements \nthe accompanying new strategy. \n \nB.  Strategy for the Technical Assistance  \n \n7.  The objectives of the TA are to (i) strengthen DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity and effectiveness in \nmanaging implementation of the national policy and strategy for local infrastructure development; \nand (ii) improve procedures and practices for various aspects of rural infrastructure management, \nparticularly rural road maintenance in a changing environment. This support is needed to enable \nDOLIDAR to reorient its role to better fulfill its mandate. While the organization must have enough \nwell-qualified and experienced staff, the numbers must be kept within strict limits, and additional \nservices  procured  by  contracting  out  many  activities  to  the  private  sector  while  maintaining \nmanagement control. The current high level of local infrastructure development is certain to be \nreduced, particularly as the capacity to maintain roads becomes saturated and demand for new \nroutes  is  satisfied.  The  private  sector  has  the  flexibility  to  provide  services  without  risking \ndevelopment of too large and unsustainable a regulating department. \n \n8.  The TA will concentrate on supporting DOLIDAR to undertake sector-wide reviews of the \nmajor issues and constraints related to effective rural infrastructure development, and of the status \nand  expected  contribution  of  initiatives  already  under  way  or  planned,  to  address  these \nconstraints. Conflicts to be resolved, critical gaps in capacities, and options for addressing key \nissues will be analyzed in detail. The TA will liaise closely with other institutional strengthening \ninitiatives to increase DOLIDAR\u2019s capacity to coordinate institutional strengthening initiatives, and \nto internalize lessons learned from them. \n \n9.  If DOLIDAR is to regulate successfully and guide DDCs and DTOs, then its staff must be \nequipped with the skills to pass information on to district colleagues and to convince them of the \nneed to comply with procedures accurately and on time. Traditional top-down, centrally led civil-\nservice  approaches  have  not  always  been  effective.  The  strategy  adopted  is,  therefore,  to \nstrengthen individual staff members as facilitators by training the trainers. \n \n10.  Although there is an extensive scope of work that would benefit from the TA (paras. 20-\n21), other initiatives are ongoing, so the terms of reference must be confirmed when the TA starts. \nIt will, therefore, be initiated through a workshop that uses the TA potential scope as the basis for \na revised series of activities and outputs that take account of ongoing complementary work by \nDOLIDAR and other agencies and projects. The workshop will be organized once the Cabinet has \napproved the national policy for local infrastructure development, and MLD has finalized how it will \nimplement the national strategy for local infrastructure development, including any organizational \nchanges. Invitees and resource persons at the workshop will include stakeholders within MLD and \nDOLIDAR,  and  representatives  from  all  external  funding  agency-supported  programs  with \nelements of institutional development, to ensure that the TA complements other initiatives. \n \nC.  Scope of the Technical Assistance \n \n11.  The TA scope is to be defined at a workshop that will take into account the mode of \nimplementation of the new national strategy, and other ongoing sectoral support initiatives when \nthe TA starts. The TA\u2019s main outputs are (i) establishment of best-practice procedures, (ii) a \nstructure of service provision, and (iii) a long-term implementation plan. \n \n12.  Establishment  of  Best-Practice  Procedures.  The  TA  will  use  the  preparation,  and \nextensive review of, working papers on a range of issues to form the basis for furthering the \n ", "Appendix 9          47           \nsector\u2019s aims as laid out in the National Policy on Local Infrastructure Development and its \naccompanying strategy. The TA will help DOLIDAR prepare a road map for the time-bound \nimplementation of the strategy to which the TA is committed, thus drawing together the experience \nof DOLIDAR\u2019s development partners and establishing best practices. The working papers will lead \nto the development of systems that can be adopted by the district agencies in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s Local Body Financial Administration Regulations. While these working papers will \nbe interim outputs, the final output will be approved best-practice procedures usable by local \ngovernment  and  project  partners.  Likely  technical  topics  under  the  TA  output  include  (i) \nprioritization  of  budget  allocations  for  rural  road  maintenance,  (ii)  social  development  and \nmobilization practices, (iii) impact evaluation, and (iv) outsourcing of services. \n \n13.  Structure of Service Provision. An agreed-on organizational structure and operational \nprocedures for DOLIDAR will be another output, based on a clear division of regulatory activities \nwith MLD, and definition of the roles and functions for each departmental unit. Critical operational \nprocedures include (i) the areas for, and methods of, extensive contracting-out of services to the \nprivate sector; (ii) arrangements for delivery of capacity-building services to, and monitoring of, \nlocal government bodies; and (iii) the mechanism for coordination and direction of development \npartner support.  \n \n14.  Long-Term  Implementation  Plan.  The  requirements  and  a  program  for  further \ninstitutional development of DOLIDAR will be defined and agreed upon as the third main output. \nThis will aim to support implementation of the new national strategy and may include (i) a long-\nterm sectoral training and human resource development strategy (with accompanying financing \nplan), for central and local levels; (ii) measures to improve the performance of the private and \nNGO sectors, enhance their skills, and develop a mature approach to quality and professionalism; \nand (iii) key areas for external funding agency support.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  DOLIDAR will be the Executing Agency, with a separate unit established to house and \nexecute the TA work. A full-time senior divisional engineer will head this unit, assisted by a full-\ntime engineer and a clerical secretary. The International Labour Organization will provide an \nexperienced international specialist in rural infrastructure institutions to act as the coordinator. The \ninternational specialist will recruit individual domestic consultants as needed to provide services in \ntechnical fields such as road maintenance planning, social development, environmental appraisal, \nplanning  and  monitoring,  and  institutional  and  human  resources  development.  A  total  of  10 \nperson-months of international and 28 person-months of local consultants\u2019 inputs are anticipated. \nThe work will be undertaken intermittently over 3 years, starting after the national policy for local \ninfrastructure development is finalized, and implementation of the policy\u2019s institutional provisions, \nincluding staffing, has been agreed upon. This should take place by the end of 2004. The TA \nwould, therefore, begin about January 2005 and terminate about December 2007. \n \n16.  The director general of DOLIDAR will chair a coordination group to assist the TA in its \nwork, review outputs, and seek approval of guidelines and procedures. This group will meet every \nthree months throughout the TA period. Other members will include the deputy director general of \nDOLIDAR as member secretary, and representatives of appropriate sections in MLD, particularly \nin planning, and monitoring and evaluation. The TA unit head and the international coordinator will \nbe observers. \n \n17.  DOLIDAR will provide and maintain a suitable, fully furnished office space with adequate \ncommunications (two telephone lines). The TA budget will cover the purchase of office equipment \n ", "48           Appendix 9 \n(photocopier, computers, printers, and accessories). One vehicle will also be rented from the TA \nbudget, and DOLIDAR will provide additional transport for the counterpart staff and for journeys \ninto the field.  \n \n18.  The International Labour Organization will select and engage the international advisor and \ndomestic consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its \nBorrowers  and  other  arrangements  on  the  selection  and  use  of  domestic  consultants.  One \ninternational and approximately five domestic consultants will be recruited as individuals. The \noutline terms of reference of the consultants are in paras. 20-21. Detailed terms of reference are in \na supplementary appendix. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements \n \n19.  The total cost is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $400,000 equivalent, covering all the foreign exchange costs ($270,000 equivalent) and \npart of the local costs. These will be funded by ADB on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The proposed government contribution of $100,000 equivalent will cover office and staff \ncosts, field transport, and facilities for seminars and training.

Outline Terms of Reference \n \n20.  The TA consultant will help DOLIDAR prepare improved implementation guidelines and \nmethodologies, based on drawing together, critically assessing, building on the achievements of, \nand recommending the best practices from procedures already being used on different rural \ninfrastructure investment programs in Nepal. The consultant will consolidate, not replicate, work \nalready being done under other external funding agency-financed programs. The priorities for new \nor revised guidelines and procedures will be informed by a workshop before the TA starts, and will \nbe confirmed early during its implementation, based on a detailed review of the status of other \ninstitutional development activities. The subjects that require attention include (i) criteria for the \nallocation of centrally and locally managed investment resources, based on geographical and \ndevelopmental priorities for poverty reduction; (ii) social appraisal, mobilization, and monitoring \nprocedures related to rural infrastructure development, including contracting-out of services in \nthese  areas  to  local  institutions; (iii) revision and refinement of work norms for construction \nactivities  carried  out  using  the  labor-based,  environmentally  friendly,  and  participatory  (LEP) \napproach, based on field analysis, so that they are cost-efficient and equitable; (iv) budgeting and \nimplementation procedures for construction works that incorporate the requirement for intensive \non-site supervision under the LEP approach; (v) refinement of DTMP preparation in light of \nexperience and of lessons from pilot applications of the integrated rural accessibility planning \nmethodology, including consideration of the use of a subregional or cluster approach to interdistrict \nintegrated  planning;  (vi)  environmental  appraisal,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  procedures;  (vii) \nproject monitoring and impact evaluation; (viii) fair and equitable compensation for acquisition of \nland and other assets, and its financing; (ix) use of geographical information systems as a \nplanning tool, particularly for maintenance, and to monitor rural infrastructure development; and (x) \nmanagement of data for management information systems and planning, at the district and central \nlevels.  \n \n21.  The TA consultant will also help DOLIDAR instill a maintenance culture among local \ngovernment bodies, and establish effective, planned rural road maintenance practices.

Introduction \n \n1.  The beneficiaries in the Ratnechaur-Bhakimli village road subproject illustrate the Project\u2019s \npoverty  focus.  Disadvantaged  groups  compose  24%  of  households.  Females  head  26%  of \nhouseholds, and 63% of households have sent income-earning members to work away from \nhome.  Most  households  (76%)  depend  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  On  average, \nhouseholds can grow food sufficient to last only 7.8 months a year. All agricultural daily-wage \nworkers  were  from  the  disadvantaged  castes  and  have  little  or  no  land  to  grow  food.  The \ndisadvantaged castes have the smallest average plot sizes and the lowest food security at around \n5.0-6.5 months of the year. Only three households (1% of project-affected families) can produce \nsufficient food to feed their households year round, and no other household can feed itself for \nmore than 8.5 months. The average income per capita of the sample households is NRs12,957, \ncompared to the national average income per capita poverty level of NRs13,065 (national living \nstandard survey figures for poverty in Nepal in 1996, factored to 2004 levels). Household income \nin  the  survey  households  is  boosted  by  pensions  and  remittances,  without  which  these \nhouseholds would be even poorer.  \n \n2.  The Project will improve physical access to economic opportunities and social services. \nThe extension into rural areas of a more efficient and sustainable transport network is an \nessential starting point and a prerequisite for socioeconomic development. About 52% of total \nproject costs will be allocated to construction of new, and rehabilitation of existing, rural roads to \nmotorable  standard;  improvement  of  main  trails;  and  construction  of  trail  bridges.  The \nsupplementary investments in small, community physical infrastructure schemes (about 9% of \ntotal costs) within the vicinity of the transport infrastructure subprojects will increase the impact \nof the road and trail investments. \n \n3.  The Project will emphasize the critically important social aspects of rural infrastructure \ndevelopment. First, the Project will give priority to measures to ensure participation of the poor \nand  disadvantaged  in  planning  and  implementation  so  that  they  benefit  directly  from  the \ninvestments in improved physical access. Second, the Project will promote the formation of \nsavings groups and initiation of other development activities within the influence areas of the \ninfrastructure  investments,  enabling  communities  to  respond  to  the  economic  and  social \nopportunities offered by improved access, and restore incomes affected by the conflict. Third, \nthe Project aims to empower the poor and disadvantaged for participation in development \nactivities. \n \n4.  The Project will address capacity-building needs in the Government, private sector, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and community institutions in the districts. This effort is \nintended to (i) ensure proper, cost-effective, and efficient use of project funds, and counteract \nattempts to divert benefits through the patronage and influence of local elites; (ii) establish \nplanned maintenance of infrastructure investments so that benefits are sustained over the long \nterm; and (iii) contribute to more transparent and accountable, and better integrated, pro-poor \nlocal management of rural development. \n \nB.  Economic Evaluation \n \n1.  Approach and Methodology \n \n5.  The  economic  analysis  does  not  attempt  to  capture  all  the  expected  benefits  and \n ", "Appendix 10          51            \nimpacts. It focuses on measuring the costs and benefits of providing improved rural transport \ninfrastructure. Because the Project applies a process approach, the rural transport infrastructure \nsubprojects were not identified during project preparation. However, a sample of five typical \npossible subprojects were identified for comprehensive technical, environmental, economic, and \nsocial feasibility study to (i) appraise the viability of the different types of transport infrastructure \nsubproject envisaged, and (ii) demonstrate how they will be prepared and appraised during \nproject implementation. The five sample subprojects were selected to cover the range of types \nof rural transport infrastructure investment to be made by the Project. They reflect priorities in \nthe project districts, and are geographically distributed across the three district clusters. Table \nA10.1 reports the basic information and data on these five subprojects. \n \nTable A10.1: Basic Data for Subprojects \n    \nDistrict  Subproject  Length Population Number of Farm Size  Construction  Maintenance\n      in area of  HHs  (ha per HH) Cost   Cost \nInfluence  ($\u2019000)  ($\u2019000/year) \nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi Road  14 km  37,132  6,876  0.99  203  13.3 \nRehabilitation \nBaglung  Badhighat Khola New  70 m  18,101  3,089  0.75  12  0.1 \nTrail Bridge  span \nMyagdi  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli  19 km  10,375  1,572  0.72  577  18.1 \nNew Village Road \nBaitadi  Baitadi-Sera Village  12 km  13,349  2,472  0.72  169  11.4 \nRoad Rehabilitation \nDarchula  Khalang-Byas Main  40 km  12,484  2,116  0.67  40  4.0 \nTrail Improvement \nha = hectare, HH = household, km = kilometers, m = meters. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6.  The analysis on the subprojects was done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. The analytical framework includes the following: \n \n(i)  The economic life of the Project is assumed to be 20 years. Sensitivity analyses of \nthe risk of a shorter economic life expectancy have been conducted. \n(ii)  A world price numeraire is used, with Nepal rupees as the unit of account with a \nconstant price year of 2003. The exchange rate applied is $1.00 = NRs76, the rate \nat loan fact-finding. \n(iii)  All prices, benefits, and costs were adjusted to 2003 constant values using (a) a \ngross domestic product deflator for all local currency costs and benefits, and (b) the \nG-5 manufacturer\u2019s unit value index for all foreign exchange.  \n(iv)  A discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the net present value (NPV) and also \nas a cut off point for the economic internal rate of return (EIRR). \n(v)  Valued in 2003 constant prices, the project benefits and costs in financial prices \nwere adjusted to economic prices by deducting taxes and duties, and by applying \nan item-specific conversion factor (CF) to non-traded local currency costs. \n(vi)  Specific CFs for various project inputs and outputs are derived based on estimated \nshares of foreign exchange and labor. Some key CFs include 0.66 for vehicles; \n0.72 for porterage cost; 0.7 for local manufactures and extracted materials; 0.7 for \nall road, trail, and bridge maintenance; and 0.93 as the standard CF. \n(vii)  A shadow wage rate of 0.87 is estimated and applied to unskilled labor to reflect \nun- and underemployment in the rural project area. \n \n \n \n ", "52          Appendix 10 \n \n2.  Quantified Benefits \n \n7.  Producer and consumer surpluses have increased due to improved access. The balance \nbetween the two types of benefits varies according to the type of improvement appraised. For \nthe economic evaluation, double counting of benefits has been avoided by excluding agricultural \nitems from generated freight traffic. Only nonagricultural generated freight traffic is included in \nthe calculation of consumer surplus benefits. \n \n8.  Producer Surplus Benefits. Agricultural households will adjust their production activities \nin  response  to  decreased  access  costs  due  to  improved  transport  infrastructure.  The  key \nassumptions are that farmers will increase their use of agricultural inputs; extend their cultivated \narea; and switch some of their production from low-value cereals to high-value fruits, vegetables, \nand pulses. Marketing costs will decrease due to lower transport costs. The net benefit is the \nchange in total return on production of the different crops.  \n \n9.  Consumer Surplus Benefits. The key assumptions are that (i) vehicle operating costs \n(VOC) for all nonmotorized and motorized transport modes will decrease, (and time will be saved) \nafter access improvement; (ii) motorable roads will see a partial shift from nonmotorized to lower-\ncost motorized modes; and (iii) lower transport costs will generate an increase in passenger and \ngoods movement. The benefits are the savings in VOCs for normal traffic, from modal shift, and \nfor generated traffic, excluding agricultural items. \n \n10.  The appraised economic benefits are summarized in Table A10.2. \n \nTable A10.2: Summary Economic Benefits Net Present Value for Subprojects \n    \nDistrict  Subproject  Consumer Surplus     Producer Surplus  \n($\u2019000)  ($\u2019000) \n    Normal Traffic  Generated Traffic    \nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi Road  1,153  9,790    19,808 \nRehabilitation \nBaglung  Badhighat Khola New  17  3    503 \nTrail Bridge \nMyagdi  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli  322  3,712    21,273 \nNew Village Road \nBaitadi  Baitadi-Sera Village  414  3,017    5,179 \nRoad Rehabilitation \nDarchula  Khalang-Byas Main Trail  247  99    6,661 \nImprovement \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  Nonquantifiable Benefits \n \n11.  Better mobility for rural people will increase the use of health and education facilities, use \nof other government services, and access to information. The reduction in travel and transport \ncosts and difficulty is expected to facilitate extensive provision of high-quality services in rural \nareas  by  the  Government  and  NGOs.  Supplementary  investments  in  community  physical \ninfrastructure schemes will further increase use of health, education, and social facilities. For \nexample,  new  or  rehabilitated  safe  drinking  water  supplies  in  the  communities  will  have  a \nsignificant impact on the health status of the users and, hence, on their capacity to work and \nimprove  their  livelihoods.  The  community  development  component  will  contribute to reduced \n ", "Appendix 10          53            \ntransaction costs for project beneficiaries by increasing their awareness of and access to essential \nservices. \n \n12.  One significant project benefit is job creation. Without the Project, rural unemployment is \nhigh, and heightened by the conflict. Most households rely on income from daily agricultural work. \nBusiness and trading activities are few because of lack of access and difficult mobility. Family \nmembers run local shops and teahouses, and few jobs exist for outsiders. Project construction \nwork in building groups (BGs) will offer significant opportunities to local people. Reserving jobs in \nroad BGs for those displaced by land acquisition for a road will also restore their income. Project \nimplementation and road maintenance will increase the incomes of the poor and disadvantaged, \nincluding women, by giving them paid jobs during the agricultural off-season. The impacts of this \nadditional  income  on  the  livelihoods  of  the  beneficiary  households  are  expected  to  include \nreduced indebtedness, increased food security and improved health, and possibly a higher level of \nchildren\u2019s school attendance. \n \n13.  In addition to improved welfare, the Project will raise beneficiaries\u2019 awareness. The BGs \nare designed to avoid domination by local elites so that the poor benefit from the Project. The \nBGs will receive technical training in addition to useful life skills such as training in functional \nliteracy, health, hygiene and nutrition, promotion of child welfare, and how to diversify incomes \nand livelihoods. The BGs will lead to greater social cohesion and organized construction works. \nThe project social mobilizers will also implement savings schemes in collaboration with group \nleaders for BG laborers. They will save 20% of their earnings, and thus learn to manage their \nsavings and improve their living conditions. Transforming the BG into a savings group will allow \nbeneficiaries to translate short-term benefits from employment on project works into sustainable \nimpacts  on  livelihoods  through  capital  formation  and  investment  in  small-scale  income-\ngenerating activities. The Project will help savings groups access microfinance to invest in \nincome-generating  enterprises.  The  Project  will  initiate  other  development  activities \n(supplementary  livelihood  investments)  within  the  influence  areas  of  the  infrastructure \ninvestments, so that local communities are better able to respond to the economic and social \nopportunities offered by improved access. The supplementary investments present another \nopportunity to target project interventions to benefit the poor and disadvantaged, and families \naffected by the conflict, unlike block grant schemes, which often benefit local elites.  \n \n14.  The benefits from direct employment of local poor people on construction works\u2014from \ncapacity building, improvements in livelihoods through social mobilization, and increased use of \nhealth and educational services\u2014are expected to be significant but have not been included in \nthe economic evaluation because they are difficult to quantify. \n \n4.  Costs \n \n15.  Table A10.1 also contains the appraised construction and maintenance costs of the \nsubprojects. In the economic analysis, construction costs have been broken down by input type, \nincluding labor (skilled and unskilled), tools, materials, and equipment, and converted from \nfinancial to economic values. Provision has been made for survey and design, supervision, and \nland acquisition and resettlement costs. The compensation on land and resettlement is about \n7% of civil work investment for new construction, and about 3% of civil work investment for \nrehabilitation.  Planned  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  costs  have  been  annualized,  at \nfinancial values of $950 per kilometer (km) per year for roads, and $100 for the trails. These \ncosts have been converted to economic values. \n \n \n \n ", "54          Appendix 10 \n5.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n16.  Appraised at a 12% discount rate, the main base-case results are summarized in Table \nA10.3. All the subprojects have EIRRs higher than 12%, positive NPVs, and benefit-cost (BC) \nratios greater than 1. The district road rehabilitation and main trail improvement subprojects show \nvery robust economic viability, with EIRRs greater than 30%. The remaining three subprojects \nhave rates of return around 13%, close to the limit of viability. \n \nTable A10.3: Subproject Appraisal Results \n   \nDistrict  Subproject  EIRR  NPV   BC  NPV/Cost \n  (%)  (NRs million) Ratio   \nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation  37.4  20.6  3.01  1.34 \nBaglung  Badhighat Khola New Trail Bridge  12.5  0.02  1.04  0.02 \nMyagdi  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road  13.1  2.91  1.07  0.07 \nBaitadi  Baitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation  12.5  0.41  1.03  0.03 \nDarchula  Khalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement  31.2  3.50  2.38  1.16 \nBC = benefit cost, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present values, NRs = Nepalese rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.  The base-case results indicate that the project approach of investment in rural transport \ninfrastructure  subprojects  identified  and  prioritized  through  a  local  participatory  process  will \ngenerate an economically viable rate of return. The subprojects appraised were selected from \nlonger lists of proposals submitted by the districts, to ensure a representative sample of the \ndifferent types of rural transport infrastructure investment. The lower rate of economic return to \nsome of the subprojects is to be expected given the project focus on poor areas with limited \nresources, and should be seen in the context that transport infrastructure subprojects, and other \nproject components, will generate significant, but not easily quantifiable, additional benefits. \n \n6.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n18.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  test  the  significance  of  the  benefit  and  cost \nassumptions. Table A10.4 shows the test results on the basis of a 20% increase in costs, the \nsame reduction in benefits, and the two combined. \nTable A10.4: Sensitivity Analysis on Benefits and Costs \n  \nDistrict  Subproject  Sensitivity Test on EIRR \nCost Increase  Benefit  Cost Increase 20% \n20%  Decrease 20%  +Benefit Decrease 20%\n(%)  (%)  (%) \n       \nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation  32.9  31.8  27.1 \nBaglung  Badhighat Khola New Trail Bridge  10.3  9.8  7.6 \nMyagdi  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road  11.4  10.8  8.2 \nBaitadi  Baitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation  10.0  9.3  6.3 \nDarchula  Khalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement  26.0  25.0  20.8 \n EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  The tests indicate that viability is more sensitive to a reduction in benefits than to an \nincrease in costs. The analysis is extended further by more detailed examination of the sensitivity \n ", "Appendix 10          55            \nof the results to changes in individual assumptions. The results of changes in two key variables, \nproduction response, and maintenance costs are in Table A10.5. \n \n20.  As summarized in Table A10.2, for motorized road investments most benefits will be from \nproducer surplus. The sensitivity tests summarized in Table A10.5 show that if producer surplus \ndoes not materialize, the economic viability of some subprojects will be marginal. \nTable A10.5: Sensitivity Analysis on Producer Surplus and Operation and Maintenance \n  \nDistrict  Subproject  Sensitivity Test on EIRR \nProducer Surplus  Maintenance  Underperformance of \nDecrease 50%  costs double  maintenance and 8-\n(%)  (%)  year life of benefits \n(%) \n       \nRamechhap  Tilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation  27.4  33.8  36.4 \nBaglung  Badhighat Khola New Trail Bridge  5.5  11.4  5.5 \nMyagdi  Ratnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road  6.9  10.2  5.6 \nBaitadi  Baitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation  7.4  6.1  6.8 \nDarchula  Khalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement  16.8  26.9  29.7 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.  Timely maintenance appears to be critical for project benefits and subproject sustainability. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that maintenance has a large impact on subprojects\u2019 economic \nperformance  if  either  (i)  required maintenance costs are found to be much higher than the \nappraisal estimate, or (ii) required maintenance is not performed and the economic life of the \nsubproject is shortened. In the first case, maintenance costs are assumed to double, and in the \nsecond case, only half of the required maintenance costs are assumed spent and that project \nbenefits last for only 8 years. The test indicates the importance of obtaining good estimates of \nmaintenance requirements, and the need for regular routine maintenance to ensure subproject \nviability and sustainability. \n \n22.  The three subprojects with base-case EIRRs close to 12% cease to be viable when the \nsensitivity tests are applied, but care has been taken to (i) prepare realistic estimates of the \ninvestment and maintenance costs for the base case; and (ii) make conservative assumptions \nabout benefits from producer and consumer responses. \n \n7.  Distribution of Benefits \n \n23.  The distribution analysis summarized in Table A10.6 shows that a large portion of the \neconomic benefits will go to the poor. Estimating the share of the poor in beneficiary groups as \n90% of unskilled labor, 30% of skilled labor, 60% of farmers, 0% of vehicle owners, 60% of \npassengers  (about  equal  to  the  poor\u2019s  representation  in  the  population),  and  10%  of \ngovernment (approximately equal to the poor\u2019s share in gross domestic product), the poverty \nimpact ratio is calculated as the economic benefits to the poor as a proportion of total net \neconomic benefits. \n \n24.  The direct beneficiaries will be those living within the influence areas of the rural transport \ninfrastructure subprojects. A preliminary assessment of the five sample subprojects indicates that \n500,000\u2013700,000 people will benefit directly, which is about one third to one half of the total \npopulation in the project districts. In all cases more than 56% of the beneficiaries would be poor, \nwith a higher proportion living in villages where food supply is insecure. \n ", "56          Appendix 10 \n25.  Depending upon the type of subproject, 65\u201370% of the cost of civil works will be for \nunskilled laborers, who are mostly landless or renting land. The Project is expected to inject over \n$10 million directly into the participating districts\u2019 economies. The feasibility study of the proposed \nrural  road  in  Myagdi  shows  that  construction  jobs will increase the incomes of typical poor \nhouseholds by 20-25% over 3 years. \nTable A10.6: Summary of Distribution Analysis Results \n(NPVs in NRs\u2019000 at 12% discount rate) \n  \nPrivate \nUnskilled  Skilled  Government/ \nItem  Farmers  Vehicle  Passengers  Total \nLabor  Labor  Economy \nowners \nTilpung-Dhobi District Road Rehabilitation \nNet Economic Effects  3,951  272  6,304  (2,447)  (288)  12,720  20,512.00\nEconomic Benefits to the Poor  3,556  82  3,782  0  (173)  1,272  8,519.00 \nPoverty impact ratio              0.42 \nBadhighat Khola New Trail Bridge \nNet Economic Effects  72  36  160  (1)  (4)  (251)  12.00\nEconomic Benefits to the Poor  65  11  96  0  (3)  (25)  144.00\nPoverty impact ratio              12.18\nRatnechaur-Bhakimli New Village Road \nNet Economic Effects  9,871  539  6,770  (928)  (81)  (14,782)  1,389.00\nEconomic Benefits to the Poor  8,884  162  4,062  0  (48)  (1,478)  11,581.00\nPoverty impact ratio              8.34\nBaitadi-Sera Village Road Rehabilitation \nNet Economic Effects  3,266  220  1,648  (754)  (104)  (4,113)  164.00 \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor  2,940  66  989  0  (62)  (411)  3,521.00 \nPoverty impact ratio              21.46 \nKhalang-Byas Main Trail Improvement \nNet Economic Effects  2,352  116  2,120  (25)  (62)  (3,357)  1,145.00 \nEconomic Benefits to the Poor  2,117  35  1,272  0  (37)  (336)  3,051.00 \nPoverty impact ratio              2.67 \nNPV = net present value, NRs = Nepalese rupees. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  One possible concern is the extent to which savings in VOCs are passed on by transport \noperators to road users. This will largely depend on the extent to which commercially operated \ntransport services are competitive. In determining the competitiveness of transport services, the \nfollowing factors should be considered: \n \n(i)  In the project area, transport charges for all modes are nominally administered \nprices, set by the district development committees (DDCs).  \n(ii)  Although motor transport operators are likely to have more influence on DDC \ndecision making than road users, informal services provided by nonmotorized \nmodes that will continue to operate as transport alternatives, will restrain formal \nsector operators from retaining all of the cost savings. \n(iii)  The most important factor affecting commercial practices of transport operators is \nthat low per capita incomes make demand for transport price sensitive. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10          57            \n8.  Project-Wide Analysis \n \n27.  The  Project  adopts  a  process  approach,  therefore  the  analysis  does  not  provide  a \nquantitative economic justification for the Project as a whole, or even derive an overall EIRR for \nthe proposed investment in improved rural transport infrastructure. Rather, the analysis covers the \neconomic viability of examples of the range of types of transport infrastructure that the Project will \nfinance. The economic viability of the overall investment in improved rural transport infrastructure \nwill be ensured during project implementation by the following: \n \n(i)  using cost-effectiveness criteria derived from the findings of this economic analysis \nto rank and prioritize potential subprojects; \n(ii)  applying  the  appraisal  methodology  presented  here  to  the  feasibility  study  of \nprioritized subprojects proposed for financing; and \n(iii)  the  incorporation  of  control  mechanisms  for  supervision  and  approval  of  the \nselection of subprojects, in accordance with the defined criteria, into the project \ndesign. \n \n28.  The Project does not set out to maximize EIRR in terms of quantifiable benefits. Rather, \nthe Project sets out to become economically viable while targeting its impacts on the poor and on \npoverty reduction, and devoting significant resources to achieving broader benefits and impacts on \nimproved rural livelihoods that are real but difficult to quantify. This approach is appropriate for a \npro-poor rural infrastructure project that gives priority to the sustainability of its physical and social \nimpacts. \n \n ", "58          Appendix 11 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

A comparison of the HDI values across the development regions in Nepal \nhighlights significant differences in human capabilities. The HDI of the Far Western region is 0.385, far lower than for the \nWestern (0.463), Central (0.476), and Eastern (0.465) regions. Poverty is deepest in the mountainous and hill regions, \nwhere 57-80% of people in the targeted districts live below the poverty line, and is most extreme in the most remote \nareas, which have the poorest access. The people of these districts experience multiple deprivation, suffering low levels \nof literacy, high levels of discrimination against women, and poor access to essential services. The Project will support \nthe Tenth Five-Year Plan targets of reducing poverty, addressing the root causes of the conflict, and increasing access in \nthese districts.  \n \nThe Project covers 18 districts in the country\u2019s five development regions. The project components are (i) community \ndevelopment and rural livelihood restoration, (ii) capacity building and decentralized local governance, (iii) rural \ntransport infrastructure, and (iv) project management services. The Project will use labor-based methods to employ \npoor people to build rural access infrastructure in their village areas. The infrastructure investments will be identified \nusing a transport planning process that ensures that the village development committee (VDC) participates in district \ndevelopment committee decisions. Selected subprojects must have beneficiaries over 50% of whom are below the \npoverty line as assessed through household surveys. Building groups (BGs) will be formed by local nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and trained to work on the subproject. The BG members will be selected through transparent \ncommunity meetings that identify the poorest 20% of the households in the wards within 3 hour\u2019s walking distance of \nthe subproject. Membership will be offered to the poorest households first; 40% of the members will be women. \nWomen-only BGs will be established. The district wage rate (approximately NRs100 per day) will be used, which is \nonly attractive to the poorest families. Social mobilizers\u2019 support will provide a link between support and training to the \npoorest groups, community awareness and participation training, and the provision of rural infrastructure within these \ncommunities.  This  support  is  vital  to  alleviate  the  poverty  of  affected  project  families  and  the  surrounding \ncommunities. \n \nTraining will be given to BG members in construction skills and also in support skills for working as a group, \nbookkeeping and record-keeping, savings and credit activities, and a range of human development (life skill) needs, \nincluding functional literacy; health and education awareness, including on sexually transmitted diseases; gender and \nvulnerable  group  awareness;  and  social  and  communication  skills.  A  number  of  training  models  are  being \nimplemented in many project districts. The Project will use the same processes, including accepted approaches to \nlocal NGO identification and training. Wherever possible, program sharing with other agencies will be sought. \n \nThe Project will develop the capacity of local NGOs. The project design assumes that local NGOs will require training \nand supervisory support at the district level to be able to deploy and manage social mobilizers in the field. District \nNGO training will be conducted by experienced national NGOs or development partner programs already operating in \nthe project districts. Additional training will be required to strengthen capacity. Training will cover social mobilizer \nprogram management, social mobilization and community animation skills, and \u201ctraining the trainer\u201d programs to \nenable the social mobilizers to train BGs and communities. \n \nCommunity social mobilization programs will be conducted to raise awareness and encourage participation in \ncommunity decision making by all community members. The social mobilizers will run the programs and promote \nawareness raising, information dissemination, and other related activities through meetings and workshops to (i) \nfacilitate effective participation by beneficiaries, including disadvantaged and socially excluded groups, in planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring; (ii) ensure that construction jobs are targeted at the local poor, who should receive \nthe full financial benefits due to them; (iii) support the formation of savings groups, and facilitate the start-up of other \nsocial and economic development activities in the areas where physical access will be improved, to make livelihoods \nsustainable; and (iv) identify supplementary infrastructure investments to be built within the community. The social \nmobilizer will help create BGs to build subproject supplementary infrastructure to enhance rural livelihoods. \n \nThe Project will enhance rural livelihoods in a number of ways, including through (i) direct wage payments to the \npoorest households, amounting to about 70% of subproject construction costs; (ii) training by social mobilizers for \nBGs and communities to access other development opportunities in the district; and (iii) skill development to reduce \nvulnerability and social exclusion. A total of 34,700 person-years of jobs and seasonal work will be created by road \nimprovement and maintenance, and other project investments. The Project is also expected to stimulate more \nproductive agriculture and cultivation of high-value crops, leading to at least a 25% increase in family incomes. \n \nThe communities within 3 hours\u2019 round-trip walking distance of a road will also directly benefit through increased \naccess, lower travel costs and times, and increased access to produce markets. Assuming that funds for \n ", "Appendix 11          59            \nsubprojects are invested primarily in motorable roads, 800,000\u20131,200,000 direct project beneficiaries are estimated, \n65% or more (325,000\u2013450,000) of whom are poor. Of these, 25% (130,000\u2013195,000) are expected to come from \ndisadvantaged castes.  \n \nThe social mobilization activities are designed to be implemented to the maximum extent possible through program \nsharing with partner organizations already active in the districts, and can readily be adapted to close collaboration \nand parallel cofinancing.  \n \nB.        Poverty Analysis                       Proposed Classification: Core Poverty Intervention  \n                                                                Thematic  Areas:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  Inclusive  social \ndevelopment \n \nIn selecting the project districts poverty indicators included (i) average income per capita per year, (ii) proportion of ethnic \ngroups and disadvantaged castes, (iii) lack of literacy, and (iv) proportion of marginalized and small farm holdings. In the \nfive districts where sample subproject area feasibility surveys were carried out, 56-76% of the households in the \nsubproject zone of influence were poor, with 50% of the households in the Ramechhap subproject area being extremely \npoor. Selected subprojects will meet pro-poor criterion that more than 50% of the beneficiaries are below the poverty line \nas assessed through household surveys. In the Ratnechaur-Bhakimli village road core subproject, average per capita \nincome of affected people was more than 10% below the national poverty level and only two households earned more \nthan the national average. \n \nIn the project districts, poverty is most acute in the Far Western region, where 73-80% of households live below the \nnational poverty line. In the Eastern and Central project districts poverty is serious. In Okhaldunga and Solukhumbu 58-\n63% of the households are poor. In the Western project districts poverty averages 46%; poverty incidence is polarized, \nwith areas of high income concentrated in urban areas, and acute poverty elsewhere. Isolated areas have higher poverty \nthan others, a high level of food insecurity, few jobs, and no basic social facilities. In the Far Western project districts only \n11-26% households can grow sufficient food to feed their families all year round. In the Western project districts, food-\nsecure households average only 16-19% in Baglung, and 46% in Myagdi. In the Ratnechaur-Bhakimli subproject area \nonly 3% households are able to feed themselves all year, and 97% averaging less than 8.5 months. Disadvantaged \ncastes have enough food only for 6 months a year. Poverty is widespread in all social groups, highest among the \ndisadvantaged castes and the socially excluded, including women. Disadvantaged caste women suffer the highest levels \nof poverty and discrimination. The project districts have high proportions of people in disadvantaged castes, reaching \n20% in the Western project districts. Mountain districts have fewer disadvantaged castes but more ethnic hill tribes than \nother areas. \n \nThe Project will identify the most impoverished areas using district data on food security at the VDC level, \nsupplemented by household surveys in VDCs and wards. The surveys include community consultation to inventory \nthe distribution of poorest households, disadvantaged ethnic groups and castes, and landless and marginalized \nhouseholds. Poverty and gender considerations are an integral part of the project design. The Project will monitor the \ndistribution of benefits to poor men and women by (i) baseline surveys; (ii) records of BGs; (iii) records of partner \nNGOs, community-based organizations, and savings and credit agencies; (iv) participatory monitoring and evaluation \nemphasizing the involvement of poor men and women, with indicators of well-being, basic needs, assets, and social \nindicators being monitored; (v) process monitoring of social mobilization reports and audits of NGO performance, (vi) \nregular project performance monitoring; and (vii) sharing of subproject experiences and lessons learned. \n \n \nC.

Subprojects will be \nidentified through existing VDC participation in finalizing district transport master plans. The Project aims to increase the \nparticipation of the socially excluded and poor in VDC decision making through a community social mobilization program, \nwhich will target vulnerable and excluded groups (women and disadvantaged castes generally). Workshops run by social \nmobilizers will help poor people develop the confidence to speak at meetings and participate in collective decision \nmaking. Communities will be trained by the social mobilizers to acquire skills to run community consultations that include \nall sections of the community. Within BGs, the capacity of men and women to voice their concerns will be strengthened \nthrough training they will receive from the social mobilization and capacity-building activities. \n  \n \nD.
