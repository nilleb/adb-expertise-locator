INTRODUCTION \n1.  The government requested additional technical assistance (TA) to continue support for \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure during an Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nManagement visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in 2013.1 Discussions were held with government \nagencies including the Ministry of Economy (MOE) as the agency responsible for PPPs, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), key line ministries, the City Development Agency (CDA) Bishkek, \nother key stakeholders, and development partners.2 On 1 July 2013, the government expressed \nits concurrence with the TA concept as described in the May 2013 mission\u2019s memorandum of \nunderstanding. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic inherited substantial assets and  almost full coverage of basic \nhealth, education, and municipal services infrastructure from the former Soviet Union. The \ngovernment,  directly  or  through  state-owned  enterprises  and  state-controlled  joint-stock \ncompanies, is responsible for financing and managing infrastructure. Economic hardships and \nresulting budgetary deficits since independence have constrained the government\u2019s ability to \nmaintain and rehabilitate existing assets and construct new ones. Technical capacity has also \nsignificantly  deteriorated.  Eroding  infrastructure  has  become  a constraint for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  is  limiting  economic  growth.  The  government  envisages  significant  new \ninvestments and improved technical capacity to develop economic and social infrastructure, with \nan increased role for the private sector\u2014including through PPPs.  \n \n3.  MOE  has  been  designated  as  the  primary  agency  for  PPP  development  and \nimplementation in the Kyrgyz Republic. A PPP Unit has been set up in MOE, and a PPP Fiscal \nRisk Management Unit has been set up in the MOF. PPP focal points have been designated in \nkey line ministries and in the CDA Bishkek. The Law on PPP was approved in February 2012 \nand became effective in May 2012. Ten priority laws and codes have been amended to ensure \nconsistency with the Law on PPP. Additional amendments are being drafted based on a review \nconducted with ADB support in October 2013.4 PPP tender procedures have been approved, \nand  a  tender  commission  has  been  established.  The  government  has  set  up  the  Project \nDevelopment Support Facility (PDSF) with a budget allocation of $2 million in 2014, and budget \ncommitments of $1 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2016.5 A comprehensive PPP policy is \nbeing drafted, and improvements to the Risk Management Policy are being made. Discussions \nhave commenced on financial support during key PPP phases, including Viability Gap Funding \nand the need for sound management of the resulting fiscal obligations. A PPP project screening \n                                                \n1  Dedicated support was provided for a high-level PPP forum in Bishkek on 23\u201324 May 2013. ADB. 2013.

Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Grant for Subprogram 3 to the \nKyrgyz Republic for the Investment Climate Improvement Program. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 March 2014. \n4  Suggested amendments to the PPP Law are: Article 8 (Authority of the Government), Article 9 (Authority of the \nAuthorized Public Body), Article 12 (Government Financial Support), Article 14 (Government Guarantees), Article \n15 (PPP Project Stages), Article 20 (PPP Project Proposed by Private Partner), Article 23 (Other provisions of a \nPPP Agreement), Article 25 (Assignment of Rights and Obligations of a Private Partner and Project Company \nUnder a PPP Agreement), Article 27 (Termination of a PPP Agreement), Article 28 (Implications of Termination of \nPPP Agreement), Article 29 (The Project Company), and Article 30 (PPP Project Financing).   \n5  Regulation of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic No. 147 \u201cOn mechanisms of financing preparation of the \nPublic\u2012Private Partnership projects\u201d dated 17 March 2014. Increases in the PDSF budget are under discussion, \nalong with other donor contributions. \n ", "2   \nmethodology has been developed.6 Fiscal risk guidelines have been prepared. Support through \nlearning-by-doing has been provided to MOE in the preparation of position papers for six project \nproposals.7 Of these, feasibility studies for two health projects are being tendered, and the \nprefeasibility study for the street lighting project has started.  \n \n4.  The basic policies and processes that govern PPPs are being developed, but substantial \nwork is needed to strengthen institutions, refine and enhance processes, and develop greater \noperational knowledge and capacity. The PPP Unit in MOE and PPP cells in key line ministries \nhave been established, but remain understaffed and have weak technical capacity to prepare \nand implement projects.8 Political support exists but is fragmented and lacks a champion. The \nrobustness of the legal and regulatory framework as well as the transparency and efficacy of the \nPPP  tender  procedures  still  need  to  be  tested.  Rigorous  and  well-documented  project \npreparation,  appraisal  and  approval  processes,  and  toolkits  to  support  them  need  to  be \ndeveloped. Mechanisms and processes need to be improved to ensure robust public investment \nprogramming and risk management. Options for government guarantees and other forms of \ngovernment  support  are  being  discussed,  but  appropriate  mechanisms  have  yet  to  be \nestablished. Awareness and understanding of PPPs among key stakeholders\u2014the public sector, \ndomestic private sector, and general population\u2014are low. The Kyrgyz Republic needs to make \nsignificant investments in these areas to develop a cohesive PPP-enabling environment. Pilot \nprojects  are  required  to  build  operational  capacity  and  work  as  feedback  mechanisms  to \nimprove the PPP framework and foster an effective PPP program. \n \n5.  Public sector management to improve the investment climate, including for PPPs, is an \noperational  priority  under  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy.9 The  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic envisages an increased role for the private sector \nin  developing,  financing,  and  operating  and  managing  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure.10 ADB has been the primary supporter of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s initiatives to \ncreate an enabling environment for PPPs since 2008.11 Technical assistance for PPPs has been \nprovided  under  successive  TA  projects  (footnotes  1,  6,  and  11).  However,  PPP  market \ndevelopment experience in various countries has shown that sustained support over several \nyears is required for a PPP market to develop, including pilot projects with good demonstration \neffects. German development cooperation through KfW is financing feasibility studies for two \nhealth projects and through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) is \nsupporting training for PPPs. The International Finance Corporation has signed transaction \nadvisory agreements for them. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is also supporting \nPPP trainings. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is helping develop a \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011.

ADB\u2019s interventions are being closely \ncoordinated with development partners through regular meetings and information exchange.  \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  will  be  increased  private  sector  participation  in  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic. There will be two PPP projects operating successfully by \n2022\u2014up  from  the  current  baseline  of  zero.12 The  outcome  will  be  improved  government \ncapacity to develop, promote, and implement viable PPP projects. A contract for at least one \nfinancially sound and competitively tendered PPP project will be signed by 2017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will help build the capacity of the government to use PPPs as an effective and \nefficient means of developing social and economic infrastructure. The TA design has drawn \nfrom global good practice and lessons learned by ADB in its PPP initiatives in India, Indonesia, \nand the Philippines. An assessment of the government\u2019s training needs and appropriate training \nmethods has been carried out. Capacity gap assessments and appropriate on-the-job and \nclassroom training will be carried out under the TA to ensure appropriate skills development and \nsustainability. Performance indicators for gender equity have been incorporated, with particular \nattention to balanced training opportunities and gender aspects of proposed PPP projects.   \n  \n8.  Output 1: Public\u2013private partnership policy and legal framework implementation \narrangements strengthened. The TA will help develop the implementation arrangements for a \ncomprehensive PPP policy and risk management policy, and revise the PPP legal framework as \nrecommended under the October 2013 review (footnote 4). The TA will also help strengthen the \npublic financial management aspects of PPPs, developing guidelines and processes to support \npublic investment programming, multiyear capital expenditure budgeting, and PPP strategies for \npriority sectors, including transport and urban areas.   \n \n9.  Output 2: The capacity of line agencies, the Public\u2013Private Partnership Unit, and \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  to  formulate,  appraise,  and  approve  quality  public\u2013private \npartnership  projects  strengthened.  The  TA  will  help  develop  toolkits  and  guidelines  to \nenhance government capacity to formulate, appraise, and approve quality PPP projects. The TA \nwill help prepare guidelines for the MOF on risk appraisal, assessment and risk sharing, and an \ninteractive process flow guidance tool.13 Model documents will be developed to guide sponsor \nagencies in the content and format of typical documents used to set up PPP projects. These will \ninclude  request  for  qualification  (RFQ)  and  request  for  proposal  (RFP)  documents  for  the \nselection of technical and financial consultants, legal advisors, and transaction advisors. To \nfacilitate learning and knowledge exchange, a twinning partnership will be established with a \nPPP agency from another country. A comprehensive PPP website will be further developed as a \n                                                \n12 Following the PPP Forum in 2013, the government has a deeper appreciation of how the private sector may \ncontribute to growth through PPPs. A number of projects are being developed currently (including those by \ndevelopment partners) and, typical of the early stages of any PPP program, only a few of those will progress to \ncompletion. Therefore, only two projects are expected to be operating by 2022. \n13 The process flow tool will cover the key phases in the PPP process: project identification (strategic planning, \nprefeasibility,  PPP  suitability,  and  internal  clearances);  project  development  (feasibility,  preparation  of  the \nprocurement process, in-principle clearance by appraisal authority, procurement, final clearance, and contract \naward); and project implementation (contract management and implementation monitoring).  \n ", "4   \none-stop information platform covering (i) legislation; (ii) guidelines, model documents, sample \nfinancial models, and reference materials; (iii) dedicated project pages containing prefeasibility \nstudies, feasibility studies, and tender documents; (iv) active and closed tenders; and (v) local \nand international press coverage. \n \n10.  Output 3: Business cases for financial support and risk guarantee mechanisms \nprepared. Government support for PPP projects through financial or guarantee mechanisms is \nan  essential  element  of  a  comprehensive  PPP  framework.  In  the  initial  stages  of  the \ndevelopment of a PPP market, such support can signal the government\u2019s commitment to its \nPPP program and steer private sector funds to PPPs. The TA will assess the need for and, if \nwarranted,  develop  the  business  cases  including  regulations  for  (i)  financial  support \nmechanisms for economically justified PPP projects that fall short of financial viability, and (ii) \nappropriate guarantee mechanisms.  \n \n11.  Output  4:  Pipeline  of  bankable  projects  developed.  Operational  knowledge  and \nexperience are essential for skills and capacity to be sustainable, and quality PPP projects can \nsave millions in costs in the long run. The TA will bring together these two essential elements of \nPPP  development.  It  will  help  develop  a  pipeline  of  projects  through  learning-by-doing  in \noperationalizing the PDSF (footnote 7).14 It will also help the government manage PDSF-funded \nconsultants for various project development steps.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  translation,  office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, logistics, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  July  2014  to  December  2016.  MOE  will  be  the \nexecuting agency given its experience with the Investment Climate Improvement Program and \nrelated TA projects (footnotes 1, 2, 6, and 11). MOE, the MOF, and the CDA Bishkek will be the \nimplementing agencies.  \n \n14.  The TA will engage 29 person-months of international and 55 person-months of national \nconsulting services. A multidisciplinary team comprising technical, financial, legal, safeguard \nand other experts with experience in PPP will be constituted as shown in Table 1. The outline \nterms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime), as the skills mix and qualifications required under the TA are diverse and difficult to \nsource  from  one  consulting  firm.  Resource  persons  will  be  recruited  from  ADB  member \ncountries using the single-source selection method. Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB will finance the purchase of limited equipment, including hardware for \n                                                \n14  The PDSF can be utilized for (i) prefeasibility studies; (ii) technical and financial feasibility studies and project \nstructuring; (iii) environmental and social safeguards, gender, and market studies; (iv) bidding and contracting \ndocuments; and (v) transaction advisory services. \n ", "  5 \nthe PPP website, which will remain with MOE at the end of the TA.
