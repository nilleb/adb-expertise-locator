During the Country Program Confirmation Mission in November 2004, the Government \nof Bhutan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) to develop a program for the development of the financial sector \nincluding  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs).  The  request  was  congruent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to develop the country\u2019s private sector through the provision of diversified \nfinancial services and better access to finance. The TA was included in ADB's Country Strategy \nand Program Update (CSPU) 2004\u20132006 for Bhutan.1  \n2.  A fact-finding mission (the Mission) visited Thimphu, Bhutan on 14\u201322 February 2005. \nThe Mission met with senior officials and technical staff from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), \nDepartment of Aid and Debt Management (DADM), Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), and other \nstakeholders including the Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan (RICB). The Government and \nthe  Mission  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is shown in \nAppendix 1 and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Financial deepening has been taking place in Bhutan over the past 20 years as the \nbroad money-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio increased from just 19.4% in 1985 to 44% \nby 2004. The expansion of the financial sector has occurred through both the growing size of \ntheir activities and the diversification of financial entities in the country. During the 1970s, the \nBank of Bhutan (BOB) was the only financial institution, but since then, a number of entities \nhave emerged including the Bhutan National Bank (BNB); two NBFIs, namely, RICB and Bhutan \nDevelopment Finance Corporation (BDFC); and National Pension and Provident Fund (NPPF). \nGiven the small size of the economy, hence limited absorptive capacity of the financial market, \nthe number and level of operations of the financial institutions are perceived to be adequate at \npresent. However, existing institutions need to be strengthened to improve their efficiency and \nwiden  the  provision  of  innovative,  diversified,  and  quality  financial  services  in  their  core \nbusiness. Also, it is essential to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision for better \nfinancial governance to ensure a conducive framework for further broadening and deepening of \nthe financial sector. \n \n4.  RMA, established by the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan Act (1982), is mandated to \nact as the Government\u2019s bank and advisor on matters relating to its functions. After over 20 \nyears of central banking development, RMA\u2019s capacity and that of the financial sector have \nbeen gradually built up. Nonetheless, there is scope for further improvement particularly in \nregulation  and  enforcement  over  the  operations  of  the  financial  sector.  Currently,  RMA  is \nrevising  the  RMA  Act  and  drafting  the  Financial  Services  Act  and  Insurance  Act3  for \nstrengthening RMA\u2019s position in regulating and supervising all existing financial institutions as \nwell as in regulating insurance and securities.   \n \n5.  RMA\u2019s self-assessment and the financial sector review conducted under ADB TA 36874 \nindicate a shortage of expertise and skills in the areas of (i) on-site and off-site supervision and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

As the \nbanking and insurance businesses are growing at a remarkable speed and financial services \nsuch as automated teller machines (ATMs) and on-line banking are available, it is essential for \nRMA to enhance its skills for supervising financial institutions and for detecting any market \nmanipulation  and  misconduct.  In  addition,  given  the  current  development  and  proposed \nchanges in legislation and regulation necessitated by the expansion of the financial sector, it is \ncritical  that  RMA  acquires  needed  legal  expertise  to  ensure  informed  review  of  drafted \nlegislations and implementing regulations for the financial system. \n \n6.  During  the  Mission\u2019s  discussions  with  RMA,  RICB  was  identified  as  one  of  the \ninstitutions that needed immediate attention. RICB was established by Royal Charter5 in 1975. \nIts insurance business covers life insurance, general insurance, group savings-cum-insurance, \nrural housing insurance and the provident fund. Until 2000, RICB had conducted extensive \ncredit financing business due to the constant inflow of liquidity from pension and provident fund \nmembers. In 2000, the Government Employees Provident Fund was hived off from RICB.6 Since \nthen, RICB has managed private provident funds for employees of private companies and used \nits large capital base to invest in real estate development. While RICB continues to be a \nmonopoly in the insurance market and plays a vital role in the socioeconomic development of \nthe country by facilitating finance and providing security, it needs to develop its skills in its \ninvestment function which differs from its core business for its large exposure in real estate \ninvestment  and  loan  receivables.  In  addition,  RMA  regulates  RICB  under  the  Financial \nInstitutions Act (FIA). However, regulation and supervision under FIA is only limited to RICB\u2019s \ninvestment activities. Relevant laws and regulations of insurance business operations are only \nbeing drafted under the Insurance Act and Financial Services Act. In view of the need to have \nconsistency between the two Acts before enactment and to set up an urgently needed proper \nlegal and regulatory framework to regulate, supervise, and monitor insurance operations, it is \ncritical for RMA to receive legal support and skills training in insurance supervision. \n \n7.  Lessons  learned  and  recommendations  from  a  previous  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector \nassistance7 suggested that due to recent increased competition from NBFIs and given the lack \nof appropriate investment opportunities, RICB has become a major lending company and the \nbulk of its income-earning assets are in the form of credit. If RICB is to restructure its profile as a \ntraditional insurance company, it needs for training in risk management, actuarial valuation, \ninformation system, and in developing investment and market strategies to further strengthen \ninstitutional  and  technical  capacity.  The  issue  of  institutional  capacity  building  of  RICB  is \nimperative and has been underscored again by recent assessments,8 in view of ensuring proper \ninsurance operations and its viability as a sound NBFI in the financial system.  \n                                                 \n5  Royal  Insurance  Corporation  of Bhutan (RICB) is  mandated to underwrite  all types of  insurance  business \nemanating from Bhutan and to finance various commercial undertakings and development of projects. The \ncorporation was incorporated under the Companies Act (1989) in 1991 and subsequently registered under the \nFinancial Institutions Act (1992) in 1994. Since 1975, its business has grown rapidly and commensurately, the \nequity rose from Nu1 billion to Nu96 billion as of 2004. RICB is an insurance and credit financing corporation \nowned by the public (60.75%) and the Government (39.25%). \n6  The Government Employees Provident Fund assets were transferred to the National Pension and Provident Fund \nBoard in 2002.

Another important issue of financial sector development that is intertwined with private \nsector development is lack of access to finance for entrepreneurs. ADB\u2019s TA 36879 along with \nthe  World  Bank  Private  Sector  Survey10  identified  the  constraints  and  issues  of  business \nborrowing and further indicated that developing the nonbank financial sector and providing \ninnovative financial products and services, such as leasing and venture capital, can encourage \ngreater competition of the financial system in the presence of the duopoly banking system, and \nthus improve finance access to enterprises,11 lower interest rates, and alleviate excess liquidity \nin  the  financial  system.  The  Royal  Securities  Exchange  of  Bhutan  (RSEB),  which  was \nestablished in 1993, has a fully automated trading system linked by a local area network to the \ntrading floor. However, trading is relatively low so that RSEB trades only twice a week. As at \nend-December 2004, only 15 companies were listed on the exchange, with a total market \ncapitalization of $78.5 million and a total turnover of $0.47 million. As the exchange is still in its \ninfancy, RMA, acting as a securities commission, provides budget grants for the operations of \nRSEB.  One  of  the  issues  of  securities/capital  market  development  arises  as  the  central \ndepository (CD) system, established to improve trading efficiency and settlement security, lacks \na  proper  legal  framework  to  govern  it.  Only  about  25%  of  the  securities  outstanding  are \ndeposited with the CD. It is foreseen that more trading and faster development in the exchange \nwill  occur  once  adequate  regulations  are  in  place.  Further  strengthening  the  institutional \ncapacity  of  RSEB  in  human  resources,  information  technology  (IT),  and  information \nmanagement will also be needed for improved functioning of the securities/capital market.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall objective of the TA is to promote good governance, enhance financial sector \ncapacity, and encourage competition by developing a more efficient nonbank financial sector. \nThe TA will support (i) strengthening the banking supervision and insurance regulation functions \nof RMA, (ii) preparing the strategy for developing the financial sector/NBFIs, and (iii) building \ninstitutional capacity. In addition to institutional capacity building of RMA and other stakeholders \nincluding RICB, the main TA outcome is the design and implementation plans of the Financial \nSector/NBFIs  Reform  Program  agreed  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  aiming  at  further \ndeveloping the financial system, including the nonbank financial sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will comprise three main components.  \n \n11.  Component  1:  Strengthening  Banking  Supervision  and  Insurance  Regulation \nFunctions of RMA. The TA will support the following activities: (i) providing technical training, \nincluding on-the-job training, to the Financial Institutions Supervision Division of RMA and other \nrelevant divisions within RMA in the areas of asset-liability management, financial statement \nanalysis,  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and  practices,  and  banking  supervision  to \nstrengthen RMA oversight over both bank and NBFIs; (ii) examining guidelines and regulations \n                                                 \n9  See footnote 3. \n10 World Bank. 2002.

Manila is currently ongoing to provide additional assistance on developing the SME sector and \nrecommending policy actions for establishing an enabling environment for SME development. The TA focus \nincludes increasing bankable projects with business support services and designing a proper SME financing \nscheme.  \n \n ", "4   \n \nin insurance operations and making recommendations for consistency with international best \npractices; and (iii) continuing the drafting of regulations for the Insurance Act and Financial \nServices Act, as needed, with a view to ensuring consistency of the two Acts before they are \nenacted. \n \n12.  Component  2:  Preparing  the  Strategy  for  Developing  the  Financial \nSector/Nonbank Financial Institutions. The TA will prepare the overall design and principal \nimplementation components of the Financial Sector/NBFIs Reform Program. The TA activities \ninclude (i) conducting a financial sector assessment including review of constraints and issues \nin  the  banking  sector,  securities/capital  market,  and  development  of  NBFIs;  reviewing  the \nexisting legislative framework, acts, and regulations pertaining to the financial sector; giving \nadditional focus on identifying the constraints on and measures for developing the nonbank \nfinancial institutions with a view to exploring the demand and possible scope for introducing \ninnovative  financial  services  and  products;  also,  reviewing  the  present  operations  of  the \ndomestic securities/capital market with focus on steps to promote good governance to ensure \nthe proper functioning of the markets and exploring ways of encouraging greater and more \nbroad-based market activity; (ii) from the findings of the financial sector assessment, developing \na strategy for promoting financial products that may be justified, such as housing, leasing, and \nventure  capital  financing  in  Bhutan;  and  (iii)  devising  a  strategy  and  pinpointing  specific \nmeasures for promoting greater activity and interest in domestic securities/capital markets, \nincluding  improvements  in  supporting  infrastructure,  institutional  capacity,  and  market \nfunctioning.  \n \n13.  Component  3:  Building  Institutional  Capacity.  The  TA  will  include  the  following \nactivities: (i) providing technical training in areas of risk assessment and management, credit \nanalysis,  and  actuarial  valuation  with  a  series  of  workshops;  (ii)  developing  appropriate \ninvestment  and  market  strategies  to  restructure  RICB\u2019s  asset  base  for  improved  risk  and \nportfolio management; and (iii) identifying and developing a suitable management information \nsystem for RICB to improve operations and management. Workshop participants will include \nrelevant technical staff from RMA and financial institutions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent, comprising $467,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $123,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $500,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $33,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. The Government will contribute the remaining $90,000 equivalent in kind as \noffice space and facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, and administrative and clerical \nsupport. ADB's financing will be used for (i) acquiring the services of international and domestic \nconsultants, and (ii) organizing workshops and providing training as required to counterpart \nstaff. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  DADM of MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. RMA will be the Implementing \nAgency. The TA will be implemented during a 10-month period starting in September 2005 and \nending by July 2006. Counterpart staff will be nominated from RICB and RMA, and will work \nclosely with TA consultants to ensure timely and effective TA implementation. \n \n ", "  5\n \n16.  ADB will engage seven international consultants for a total of 13 person-months and \nthree domestic consultants for a total of 9 person-months to provide the required consulting \nservices. Consulting services will be delivered intermittently over 10 months. An international \nconsulting firm will be recruited using simplified technical proposals under the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting consultants. The consultant team (person-\nmonths are in parentheses) will comprise a financial sector/banking supervision expert (team \nleader) (4), a securities/capital market expert (2), an insurance/NBFIs expert (3), an accounting \nand auditing expert (1), a legal expert on securities/capital markets (1), a legal expert on \ninsurance/NBFIs (1), and an actuary (1). The domestic consultant team will include a financial \nsector specialist (4), a legal expert (2), and an IT specialist (3). The outline terms of reference \nare included in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The  consultants  will  prepare  (i)  an  inception  report  within  15  days  of  their  fielding \nincluding a needs-based assessment and an action plan, (ii) a midterm report 4 months after \nfielding, i.e., by December 2005, (iii) a draft final report for the TA, to be submitted 3 weeks \nbefore the end of the consulting term, and (iv) a final report at the end of the consulting \nassignment. The midterm report will include a financial sector assessment to be used as the \nbasis for formulating the strategy for further developing the financial sector over the medium and \nlong  terms.  The  final  report  will  have  the  finalized  strategy  and  principal  implementation \ncomponents of the Financial Sector/NBFIs Reform Program, and include all the necessary \nappendices required for the ADB report such as recommended policy changes (the policy \nmatrix),  funding  agencies\u2019  coordination  matrix,  poverty  impact  analysis,  and  environmental \nimpact matrix of each proposed policy action.  \n \n18.  At least two tripartite meetings among the principals of the TA will discuss the midterm \nand draft final reports. Broader and extensive consultations on policy issues will be emphasized \nto reach consensus on the program design with government officials and relevant stakeholders. \nAll reports will be submitted (in hard and soft copies) to the Government and ADB for review \nand comments. Consultants will duly incorporate the comments received while finalizing the \nreports. The reports shall be made available 2 weeks from the date of the tripartite meetings or \nreceipt of comments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for preparing the Financial Sector/Nonbank Financial Institutions \nReform Program, and hereby reports such action to the Board. \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved governance,  Improved legal and  Royal Monetary  \u2022  Program design is \nenhanced financial  regulatory framework,  Authority (RMA) annual  implemented \nsector capacity, and  strengthened (bank and  reports  \u2022  Government and ADB sign \nmore competition  nonbank) financial sector    the loan agreement on \nencouraged by a more  regulation and supervision,  Royal Securities  Financial Sector/Nonbank \nefficient nonbank  stronger institutional  Exchange of Bhutan  Financial Institutions \nfinancial sector  capacity, and broadened  fact sheets  Reform Program \n  and deepened financial     \nmarket  Annual reports of other \n  relevant stakeholders \n \nAsian Development \nBank \n(ADB) review missions \nOutcome      Assumptions \nFinancial  Memorandum of  MOU  \u2022  The Government, RMA, and \nSector/Nonbank  Understanding (MOU)  other stakeholders during \nFinancial Institutions  signed by Government  technical assistance (TA) \nReform Program design  during appraisal mission for  implementation fully \nand recommended  program loan in August  cooperate and participate  \naction plans for further  2006  \u2022  The government concurs on \ndeveloping the financial  the program design and \nsystem, including the  recommended action plans  \nnonbank financial  \u2022  Technical expertise to meet \nsector   output requirements is \navailable \n\u2022  The Government continues \nfocus and thrust on financial \nsector development \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bhutan: \n \nPrivate sector development is vital in fostering economic growth and creating employment opportunities to \nachieve the development goals of the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan (2002\u20132007). However, as the private sector \ncontinues to face several constraints arising from the small-size domestic markets, lack of labor, underdeveloped \ninfrastructure, and lack of adequate access to finance, the contribution of the private sector to overall gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) is yet to be the engine of economic growth or poverty reduction in Bhutan. Therefore, the Government \nof Bhutan recognized the need to develop the financial sector to support private sector growth. Lack of adequate \nfinance and access to finance, coupled with high interest rates and high collateral requirements that are recognized as \nsignificant drawbacks for entrepreneurs will be addressed with the objective of recommending means to improve the \nfinancial system. At a broader level, the problem also seems due to the lack of competition among financial \ninstitutions, which in turn hinders the development of more and better financial products and services, such as leasing, \nventure capital, credit cards, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Hence, the technical assistance (TA) will also \nreview and prepare a strategy to promote competition in the financial sector. \n \nThe Project will support strengthening the financial system by promoting good governance in banking \nsupervision  and  insurance  regulation,  building  institutional  capacity,  and  encouraging  financial  competition  by \ndeveloping a more efficient nonbank financial sector. It is expected that better financial intermediation provided by an \nimproved financial system including the nonbank financial sector can increase the ratio of credit to the private sector \nas percentage of total financial assets to more than the current 20% level and private sector contribution (in the \nmanufacturing, trade and commerce, and services sectors) as percentage of GDP from the current 34% level. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nFinancial intermediation and market competition improve the efficiency of resource allocation and therefore \nenhance private sector competition and entrepreneurship. As a result, greater financial development generates more \nemployment, induces better innovation, and augments high economic productivity to provide economy-wide benefits. \nThe social benefits will be explored at an aggregate level.
