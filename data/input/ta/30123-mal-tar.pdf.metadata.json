INTRODUCTION\n1 The Government of Malaysia has requested Bank technical assistance (TA) for\nupgrading of the national labor market information (LMI) system. Accordingly, the proposal\nwas included in the Bank's 1996 Country Program. A Fact-finding Mission visited Malaysia\nfrom 23 September to 3 October 1996 and reached an understanding with the Government on\nthe objectives, scope, terms of reference, estimated costs, and implementation arrangements\nfor an advisory TA for Upgrading the Labor Market Information System.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Since the mid-1980s, Malaysia has experienced a period of rapid and sustained\neconomic growth which is transforming the country into an industrialized and urbanized\neconomy. During this period, Malaysia moved from a situation of labor surplus to that of\nvirtual full employment in Peninsular Malaysia. The unemployment rate declined sharply from\n5 1 percent in 1990 to 2.8 percent in 1995, the lowest level on record. Shortages of\nprofessionals and skilled workers emerged as the education and training system was unable to\nmeet all the manpower requirements generated by the high rate of economic growth.\n3. Full employment is expected to continue during the period of the Seventh\nMalaysia Plan (7MP), 1996-2000. It is recognized that to maintain high levels of economic\ngrowth, higher levels of productivity will be required. The efficient utilization and continuous\ndevelopment of human resources will be a major policy objective during the 7MP period, and is\no key element in the Bank's interim operational strategy for Malaysia. In support of this\nobjective, the Government is undertaking initiatives to upgrade the skills of its labor force,\npromote improved managerial competence, and further develop scientific and technological\n.xpertise To improve labor market mobility, the labor market information infrastructure will be\nstrengthened during the 7MP. The need for timely and accurate labor market information\nincreases as the economy becomes more industrial, job structures more complex, and\nproduction technologies more diverse. The information required for job search and placement\nactivities also increases. The existing system is generally inadequate to cater to the specific\ninformation needs of job-seekers, school leavers seeking pre-employment training and\neducation opportunities, and the employment requirements of industry.\n4 At present LMI is mostly Government-oriented and is collected on both a\nregular and ad hoc basis by a range of Federal Government agencies including the\n[)epartment of Statistics (DOS), the Ministry of Human Resources (MHR) and its departments,\niz., the Department of Labour (DOL) and the Department of Manpower (DOM), as well as a\nrange of agencies and institutions directly involved in education and training. Each agency\nhas its own objectives and methods for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating LMI. This is\nnot unusual, but each agency needs to become more responsive to user needs. While ad hoc\ncollaboration and coordination takes place between agencies there is no formal coordination\nrrechanisrn to consider and prioritize the requirements of the range of users of LMI and to\na:od auphcation in the collection and analysis of data. Clearly, formal coordination\narrangements for LMI are required but they need to take account of the existing and planned\nbroader coordination arrangements on economic and social statistics.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.", "2\n5. Timely time series data, that are available to central agencies for the purpose\nof macroeconomic management, could be made more widely available for planning and policy\nformulation in human resource development. In general, agencies are collecting extensive LMI\ndata at considerable cost but this information is often used only for internal purposes or is\npublished with long delays. There are several key causes for lack of timeliness in publication\nand dissemination, most notably a lack of staff, low levels of computerization, lack of firm\ntarget dates for release, and delays in approval of the release of data. Difficulties in recruiting\nand retaining personnel has affected LMI performance of several agencies. More generally,\nthere is need to improve responsiveness to the needs of data users. Timely publication and\nwider dissemination will promote more active use and analysis of LMI with the private sector\nand academia and contribute to a general strengthening of national analytical capacity, and in\ntime will enhance public inputs to LMI planning. On the other hand, there is a need to carefully\nreview the wide range of data being collected with a view to containing costs, avoiding\nduplication, and reducing the burden on the responders. This is particularly relevant for data\nthat is tabulated and published with such a long time lag that its value to users is significantly\nreduced.\n6. A Vocational Training Information System (VOCATIONS) is being developed by\nthe MHR to provide a computerized and integrated information network linking all the major\npublic training agencies involved in vocational training. Information will be made available\nthrough the system on training agencies, training programs. and the requirements and output\nof skilled manpower. It is expected that the system will be extended to central agencies. state\nagencies and the private sector during the 7MP period (1996-2000). Other  agences are\ncomputerizing their operations with varying degrees of success. The Public Service\nDepartment (PSD) has made good progress in developing a computer-based management\ninformation system and the Ministry of Education (MOE) is also in the process of upgrading its\nmanagement information system (MIS). The diversity of agencies collecting LMI and the\nmultiplicity of sources and methods implies that in Malaysia (as in other countries) a monolithic\nriformation system is not a realistic option. A more practical objective is the further\ncomputerization of several systems in key agencies, with data interchange and linkages being\nprovided by electronic channels, such as the internet or an intranet, to supplement\nVOCATIONS.\n7. Rapid changes in the economy have created a demand for information by the\neducation and training system which existing LMI has generally failed to satisfy. This has\nresulted in many institutions resorting to collecting and analyzing data themselves and relying\non less formal feedback mechanisms. A positive aspect is the development of increasingly\nclose direct contact and liaison with industry. The key requirement here is for more quantitative\ndata on current conditions :n the labor market in sufficient detail to be of use to the education\nand training system. In this regard, there is an urgent need to update the national dictionary of\noccupational classification (DOC). The DOC is used by the Employment Service of the DOM to\nfaclitate matching of job seekers with vacancies, It is also used in surveying manpower needs\nby employers, and in planning future training programs. The DOS also makes heavy use of the\nDOC for occupational classification in household surveys and censuses.\nForeign workers are a significant element in the national economy, particularly in\ntne construction and plantation sectors and also in manufacturing. While administrative data\ndata coilected by a range of Government agencies in the course of their ongoing operations\nfor example by the DOL, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). the Social Security\nOrganizaton (SocSo) and the Department of Immigration) on the foreign work force exists", "3\nfrom a variety of sources, it is insufficient to enable policy makers to obtain a complete profile\nof the situation.\n9. Women are playing an increasingly important role in the work force as\nevidenced by their increased participation rate. Women are identified in the 7MP as an\nimportant source of labor supply. For this potential labor resource to be more fully utilized, the\nLMI system needs to provide policy makers and planners with sufficient information on the\ndetailed trends in female employment, and training requirements. Considerable gender-\ndifferentiated data is already being collected by DOS and agencies under the MHR. It would be\nappropriate if this were more fully utilized.\n10 Private nonagricultural wage and salary employment has become the major\nfocus of labor market analysis, and there is an urgent need for prompt establishment data on\nemployment and earnings for this broad aggregate. Such data would form the essential basis\nboth for monitoring current developments at the sectoral level and projecting employment\ndemand by sector the first step in projecting demand by occupation. At present, the only\ncomparable data, collected by DOS, covers a much less comprehensive set of sectors\naccounting for less than half of private nonagricultural wage employment, and is available with\na considerable lag.\n11 The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has provided regular advice and\nassistance to the MHR and its departments. Canada has also provided assistance to DOM in\nthe area of occupational classification. Unfortunately, the benefits of this assistance have been\ndisspated considerably by staff movements. Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA)\nhas also provided support to the National Vocational Training Council. Support is anticipated\nfrom the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/World Bank to upgrade projections\nof SKIH demands.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n2. The TA will assist the Government to upgrade the LMI system, making it more\nefficient and responsive to the needs of users in the Federal Government and state\ngovernments, employers and employees and school leavers, educational and training\nnstitutions. the private sector, and academia. The TA will identify the priority needs of users\nand promote the efficient collection, analysis, and dissemination of information.\nRecommendations will be made on appropriate coordination mechanisms, staffing. and\ntraln;ng requirements. The action plan will include both a set of immediate measures and\nfurther. phased development. The DOC will be updated in view of its strategic role in planning\nfor overcoming skill shortages. A range of sources of administrative data (including EPF and\nSocSo will be developed as a cost-efficient means of obtaining prompt information on\nemployment and earnings. The output of the TA will benefit the Midterm Review of the 7MP\nscheduled for 1998.\n2\t Scope\n3\t The A will review Malaysia's labor market infrastructure and analyze its\nreevance to Malaysia's emerging economic structure. It will identify gaps in the coverage and", "4\nmake recommendations to improve the capacity, relevance, and efficiency of the system. The\nTA will ascertain what statistics should be collected, and at what frequency, on the basis of\nrequirements of the range of endusers, viz., employers, workers, job seekers, policymakers,\nprogram managers, and researchers. The adequacy of data on women in the work force will\nbe reviewed. Current data sources on the foreign labor force will also be reviewed and\nrecommendations made to obtain a more complete profile of the foreign work force. Strategies\nto improve the collection and quality of data necessary for the estimation of labor productivity\nwill be developed. The recommendations of the TA will be presented in a phased action plan.\n14. The TA will make recommendations on data collection to simplify reporting, and\nreducing duplication and costs. The TA will make recommendations on the analysis and\ndissemination of statistics to endusers at both the national and subnational level, including the\ntimeliness and frequency of distribution. Particular attention will be given to the needs of the\nless economically advanced states.\n15. The TA will, in particular, review and make recommendations on the role and\nactivities in [MI of Government agencies and will take account of the role of private sector\nbodies in relation to their contribution to the LMI system. Appropriate coordination mechanisms\nwill be recommended for the ongoing management and development of the LMI system. The\nTA will also make recommendations on staffing and training requirements. On-the-job training\nwill be provided to counterpart staff to ensure continuity of data collection and analysis in the\npost-TA period.\n16.\t Specific assistance will be provided to update the national DOC and provide\ntraining to enable its regular subsequent updating. The availability of an up-to-date\nclassification system will have a direct impact on the quality and reliability of manpower data\nbeing collected. Assistance will also be provided to exploit the data available from the EPF and\nother administrative data sources including those of the DOL, PSD and SocSo to provide\ntimely information on employment and earnings. These data are a valuable resource which will\nbe of considerable benefit to economic policy makers, planners, and a range of other users.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $807,000 equivalent. The Bank will\nfinance the foreign cost of $560,000 for the international consultants on a grant basis. The\nGovernment will finance the local currency costs totaling $247,000 equivalent for the domestic\nconsultants, the workshop/seminar, counterpart and support staff, office accommodation and\ntransport, as indicated in the cost estimates in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n18. The Economic Planning Unit (EPU) will be the Executing Agency for the TA.\nEPU will convene and chair a steering committee which will be the primary counterpart to and\nsupport group for the consultant team. The team will work under the supervision of the\nDrector, Human Resources Section, EPU. The steering committee will comprise\nrei resentatives from MHR, MOE, DOS, DOM, DOL, MOW, HAWA, other relevant agencies\nand State Governments of Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. In view of its ongoing\nrole of providing advce and assistance to MHR, ILO will be invited to attend tripartite meetings\nneid under the TA, as appropriate, to provide expert inputs. During the course of the TA, the", "5\nconsulting team will visit the States of Sabah and Sarawak and other states, as appropriate, to\nensure that their needs are taken into account in the development of their recommendations.\nThe TA will be undertaken over a eight month period commencing in March 1997. The\nconsultants will submit an inception report by the end of the first month. An interim report will\nbe submitted at the end of the fourth month. During the fifth month of the TA, the consultants\nwill organize a seminar/workshop to present the draft findings and recommendations contained\nin the interim report to agencies involved in the LMI system, analysts and researchers, and\nendusers including from the private sector. A draft final report will be completed by the middle\nof the sixth month and will be discussed at a final tripartite meeting. The final report\nincorporating comments from the Government and the Bank will be prepared within six weeks\nof the final tripartite meeting. All reports will be presented to EPU, MOE, MHR, DOS, and the\nBank. The TA is expected to be completed in November 1997.\n19. The TA will be undertaken by a consulting firm, selected in accordance with the\nBanks Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. The\nsimplified technical proposal procedure will be used in the selection of consultants. Shortlisted\nfirms will be requested to submit joint proposals which will include domestic consultants.\nHowever, the domestic consultants will be paid directly by the Government under a separate\ncontract to be negotiated between the Government and the local consultants. The Government\nreserves the right to engage other domestic consultants if satisfactory agreement cannot be\nreached with the consultants chosen under the Bank selection procedure. Seventeen person-\nmonths of international consultant input and 12 person-months of domestic consultant input\nwiH be required The consulting team will consist of experts in labor market information systems\ndesign, labor market statistics and analysis, and occupational classification. The domestic\nconsultants will be supervised by the international team. Terms of reference for the consultants\nare given in Appendix 2.\n20 The consultants will be supported by a team of Government counterparts. As a\nlack of adequate staffing has been a cause of the absence of recent updates, the LMI division\nof DOM wil need to he strengthened by the addition of two staff to act as counterparts to the\nccnsutants to work full-time with them and to carry forward the work after their departure. The\nadministrative data expert wall also require adequate full-time counterpart staff to carry forward\nthe supply of data to users on a permanent basis. The Government will communicate to the\nBank its arrangements for counterpart staff prior to the commencement of the TA.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21, The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Malaysia in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $560,000 for Upgrading the Labor Market Information\nSystem and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAppendix I\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($)\nForeign\t Local\t Total\n\t\nItem Exchange\t Currency\t Cost\nA.

(Note that a diskette of 1500-88 is\navailable with copyright protection).\n(ii) Review completed groundwork and user needs for the dictionary of\noccupational classification (000), and propose a work plan as needed to\ncomplete the job by the target date, including preparation of all required\nindexes. Within the plan, create a plan for the expert's three months' absence\nbetween first and second visits.\n(iii) Propose an efficient method for amending the 1989 DOG to make it compatible\nwith the ISCO 88. Propose an efficient method for creating a \"conversion index\"\nshowing the relationship of each occupational classification code in the existing\nDOC to each code in the new 000.\nAdvise the team on efficient methods for creating a list of occupations which\nmay need to be added to the DOG by comparing ISCO 88 with the 1990\nSingapore classification (based on ISGO 88) and with classifications by other\nrelevant countries that have added occupations to ISCO 88. The ILO may also\nhave information on occupations which have been added to ISCO 88 by\nmember countries.\n(v) Review occupations proposed for special attention, and suggest a target for\nhow many cases can be managed in the available time and a method for\nprioritizing occupations to be studied first. Propose a methodology for\ninvestigating the selected cases.\n'vi)\t Provide group training to all the staff involved in the work.\nTasks for the second visit (1.5 months). The second visit of 1.5 months will take\nplace at the end of the TA. Tasks for the second visit will be as follows:\n(t)\t Review the team's work during the expert's absence. If necessary, revise work\nplan based on recent experience.", "Appendix 2, page 8\n(ii) Provide feedback to team members on work accomplished, thus providing on-\nthe-job training. If necessary, provide additional group training to staff involved\nin the work.\n(iii) Prepare a report recommending how Department of Manpower (DOM) staff\nshould proceed to complete the job by the target date. Include detailed advice in\nregard to technical problems on which there has not yet been an opportunity for\non-the-job training. List all occupational groups which can be deleted from the\nMalaysian classification and those which need to be added or modified.\n(iv) Evaluate advantages and disadvantages of a menu of alternatives in regard to\nresponsibility for future DOG development. The menu would include: continued\nDOM responsibility, DOS responsibility, joint DOM-DOS responsibility, and use\nof private consultants. Indicate which alternative has the best prospects for\novercoming the chronic problem of rapid staff turnover and for enhancing\nefficiency in an era of Government right-sizing.\n(v) Provide recommendations on work flow and staffing for occupational\nclassification over the next five years. Recommend a schedule of revisions and\npriority topics for study during the first revision. Provide recommendations for\nthe timetable and staff requirements for translating the DOG into Bahasa\nMelayu. Evaluate the feasibility of extensive borrowing and comparing the\nclassification from neighboring and other newly industrializing countries on a\nregular basis in the future, to reduce the burden of updates. Evaluate costs and\nbenefits of further developments such as a computerized coding index.\n(vi) Provide recommendations on future needs for training by outside experts and\ntechnical assistance, if any, and the likely cost of such assistance.\nGroundwork by counterparts before the arrival of the advisor. (1) Prepare a\ndefinite target for producing a new DOG on an accelerated schedule. (2) Allocate\nadditional staff and budget (including cost of field visits) as needed in support of the\naccelerated schedule. (3) Prepare a list of categories missing from both ISGO 88 and\nDOG 89 or inadequately described and requiring special examination.\nThe list of candidate categories for special examination may be as long as necessary.\nIt can be compiled in two steps. (1) Gonsultation with users, including the Department\nof Statistics, vocational training institutions, the Employment Service, and all other\ninterested agencies. (2) Limited research, including selected searches of inspection\nreports by the Department of Labour and publications of the Research and Planning\nUnit of the Ministry of Human Resources and the Gareer Guidance Unit of the\nManpower Unit.\nB.\t Domestic Consultants\nThe domestic consultants will report to the team leader and coordinate with the\ncorresponding international experts in completing the terms of reference (TOR). The\ndetailed TOR for the domestic consultants are as follows:", "Appendix 2, page 9\n1. Labor Market Information Expert\nTasks. Prepare the following drafts, under guidance from the team leader.\n(i) Compile basic data from a wide variety of published and unpublished sources to\ncreate a statistical profile of the labor market. Use this data to identify major\ndata anomalies, breaks in series, other data quality issues, and data gaps.\n(ii) Prepare a conspectus of data needs, in tabular form. For each data type that is\npresently collected or could be collected in the near future, first describe its\ncurrent availability (with what time lag and through what distribution channel).\nGive priority to data that are or can feasibly become reliable. Itemize likely users\nof the data. For each pairwise combination of data type and user, itemize the\nfollowing:\nhow will the data be used, and what kind of decisions it will affect;\nevaluate the importance of this particular use, assigning a priority code;\nspecify the release procedures required to channel the data to this user.\nSpecify whether publication is necessary or whether in-house availability\nis sufficient; and\ncomments, if any, on the format and reliability of the data.\n(iii) Recommend ways to streamline existing data collection efforts including:\nidentify ways to cut nonessential efforts in order to reduce respondent\nburden and use the time of Government workers more efficiently.\nEvaluate whether such cutbacks could free enough resources for\nexpansion of priority areas.\nidentify ways in which existing ad hoc, and sometimes overambitious,\nsurvey efforts could be replaced by more regular and appropriate efforts\nparticularly in regard to tracer studies and surveys of occupational\nneeds.\n(iv) Make recommendations with regard to the following issues:\nstrategies for improving estimates of the number of foreign workers (after\ncompiling data from the various agencies involved in preparing\nestimates);\nstrategies for tabulating and analyzing gender-differentiated data (after\ncompiling data from the various agencies involved in collecting data);\nstrategies for improving the collection and quality of data necessary for\nthe estimation of labor productivity; and", "Appendix 2, page 10\n(v) Prepare the seminar under guidance from the team leader.\n(vi) Assist the team leader on other tasks in the work plan, in ways to be defined in\nwriting by agreement with the team leader within the first two weeks of the\nassignment. This work plan may, however, be revised subsequently if required\nby the team leader.\n2. Database Development Expert/Systems Analyst\nTasks. Provide database development and programming support to the expert on\nusing administrative data as source of labor market indicators, including:\n(i) Prepare the following drafts, under guidance from the administrative data\nexpert.\nWork with EPF, SocSo, DOL, DOS, the Registry of Business, and other relevant\nagencies to obtain detailed tabulations that facilitate comparison of their data\nwith one another, especially in regard to the issues of industrial and regional\nclassification, and coverage differences. Obtain microdata sets for analysis on a\nPC, and analyze them using a powerful data management program. Compile a\nset of tables providing a profile of available data.\nStudy the problem of industrial classification in the EPF. examining data for a\nsmall set of individual employers on a case-study basis and comparing this\ndata, where possible, with other sources such as SocSo or DOS.\nStudy the possibility that EPF and SocSo multi-establishment employers (such\nas large conglomerates) could be encouraged (or even gradually mandated) to\nfile their reports under separate codes for each establishment. This procedure\nwould not only help guarantee the authenticity of state and district data, but\nwould also help to ensure that industrial coding was tailored to the major\nproduct of each establishment, not simply to the major product of large,\nmultidivisional companies. The procedure would also entail administrative\nbenefits for EFF and SocSo. Inasmuch as large companies will have all\ncomputerized their reports to EPF and SocSo, reprogramming the reports to\ndistinguish establishment codes may not be difficult. Visit establishments to\ndiscuss the problem and conduct case studies. Evaluate the burden on\nestablishments of such reprogramming. Compare the EPF and SocSo systems\nwith the DOS arid DOL systems of establishment coding.\n(ii) Assist the expert on using administrative data as source of labor market\nindicators on other tasks in the work plan, in ways to be defined in writing by\nagreement with the said expert within the first two weeks of the assignment, but\nsubject to subsequent modification if required by the administrative data expert.\n(ni) Assist the team leader in making recommendations in regard to computer\nsoftware and hardware requirements for Government agencies involved in LMt\ncoUection and analysis.", "Appendix 2, page 11\nC.\t Reports\nThe consultants will submit an inception report by the end of the first month. An interim\nreport will be submitted at the end of the fourth month. During the fifth month of the TA, the\nconsultants will organize a seminar/workshop to present the draft findings and\nrecommendations contained in the interim report to agencies involved in the LMI system,\nanalysts and researchers and endusers including from the private sector. A draft final report\nwill be completed by the middle of the sixth month and will be discussed at a final tripartite\nmeeting.
