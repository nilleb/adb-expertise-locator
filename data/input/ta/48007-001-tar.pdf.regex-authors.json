INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare a concession law \nfor infrastructure and public services. Following a reconnaissance mission in January 2014 and \na  fact-finding  mission  in  May  2014,  ADB  and  the  government  reached  a  preliminary \nunderstanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of \nreference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five\u2013Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 calls for an expansion in infrastructure \nand other municipal public services, which is in line with the government\u2019s goal of achieving \nequal access to basic public services.2 Deepening the reform of the government\u2019s administrative \nsystem is also planned. The competence of government administration will be improved to \nmake it more performance oriented. \n3.  The  Several  Opinions  of  State  Council  on  Encouraging  and  Guiding  Healthy \nDevelopment of Private Investment, a document issued in 2010, had earlier promoted the entry \nof  private  capital  into  the  delivery  of  public  services.  Areas  where  private  investment  is \nencouraged include infrastructure, municipal services, education, and public rental housing. In \nNovember 2013, the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party \nreinforced the broader importance of the private sector by emphasizing the need for the market \nto play a decisive role in the PRC\u2019s next stage of development. \n4.  Public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  can  help  implement  these  policy  initiatives  by \nbringing the private sector into the delivery of public services. PPPs provide a performance-\nbased management framework that can improve the results achieved by public agencies. They \nalso mobilize additional financial resources and expertise from the private sector to expand and \nstrengthen the delivery of public services. As demonstrated in other countries, sound PPPs can \ndeliver public projects faster, at lower cost, and at higher quality. \n5.  The PRC has been an active user of PPPs since the early 1990s. More than 1,000 PPPs, \nwith  investment  commitments  in  excess  of  $100  billion,  have  been  structured  to  provide \ntransport and communication services, energy, clean water, wastewater treatment, and some \nsocial services.3 This extensive experience can be built on to deliver more and higher-quality \nprojects, and to extend the use of PPPs into different areas of the economy (e.g., education). \n6.  However,  PPP  activity  in  the  PRC  has  trended  down  since  the  mid-1990s.  Some \nestimates show that the value of investment commitments under PPPs fell to a low in 2010 of \n$1.1 billion, which was less than 10% of its peak in 1997.4 While the downward trend is largely \nbecause of the emergence of alternative ways of financing public services, notably the local \ngovernment investment vehicles and land transactions, it has also been caused by gaps in the \nenabling environment, such as the absence of a national PPP law, PPP units, and manuals and \nprocedures for preparing and implementing PPPs. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 June 2014.  \n2  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2011. Twelfth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social \nDevelopment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Beijing. \n3  The data show PPPs that involve a private partner. A private partner excludes a state-owned enterprise or its \nsubsidiary  that  remains  majority  owned by  government entities  (World  Bank. 2013. Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Projects Database. World Bank Group. http://ppi.worldbank.org). \n4  World Bank. 2013. Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects Database. World Bank Group. \n ", "2  \n7.  The interest in PPPs is now rebuilding, spurred by the tightening fiscal position of local \ngovernments.  Rising  local  government  debt  levels  and  central  government  efforts  to  curb \nindirect financing mechanisms used by the local governments are encouraging the pursuit of \nmore transparent, fiscally sustainable alternatives. A window of opportunity to strengthen the \nquality of the PRC\u2019s PPP program has opened. In May 2014, the Ministry of Finance launched \ninternal PPP units to help develop PPP capacity and strengthen the enabling environment. \nThese units are to be replicated by local governments. \n8.  The 2011 Asian Infrascope study ranked the PRC\u2019s enabling environment for PPPs in an \nemerging category of countries for PPPs. The PRC\u2019s \u201cphenomenal wealth of PPP experience\u201d \nled to a high ranking in operational maturity. However, the PRC received a low ranking for the \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional framework\u2014a key factor being the absence of a national PPP \nlaw.5 A  PPP  has  different  requirements  than  a  conventional  public  investment  project,  for \nexample, in relation to procurement and the management of fiscal risk. Most countries with \nactive PPP programs have a corresponding law to clarify how these requirements are managed. \n9.  The PRC has adopted an incremental approach to the development of the legal and \nregulatory framework for PPPs. More than 40 regulatory instruments are in place; many best \npractice approaches to PPPs are also in use. However, many regulatory instruments are sector- \nor location-specific, and lower-order regulatory instruments are prevalent. In 2013, the State \nCouncil  approved  the  preparation  of  a  concession  law  for  infrastructure  and  other  public \nservices, and an initial draft has been prepared. Such a law could strengthen the enabling \nenvironment  for  PPPs  by  providing  a  single,  basic  authorizing  document  that  would  help \nstandardize the approaches to preparing and implementing PPPs nationally and across sectors. \nIt could lower the transaction costs faced by market participants, which would facilitate the \ndevelopment of the PPP market, and encourage investment by better protecting the interests of \nthe private sector. It could also help extend the PPP model into new areas of the economy, \nparticularly  the  social  sectors,  and  develop  a  broader  range  of  PPPs.  Such  a  law  would \ncomplement the recently launched internal PPP units.6 \n10.  Under the PRC\u2019s country partnership strategy, ADB\u2019s public sector operations aim to \nstrengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  private  development  by  financing  infrastructure, \nsupporting policy and regulatory reforms, and improving access to finance. Urban development \nis identified as a priority area for support for private sector participation and PPPs during 2011\u2013\n2015. The country partnership strategy also provides for complementary support for knowledge \nsharing to promote best practices.7 \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be a strengthened enabling environment for PPPs. Performance will be \nmeasured by the ranking of the PRC\u2019s enabling environment for PPPs in the Asian Infrascope\u2019s \ndeveloped country category by 2018. The outcome will be an improved legal framework for the \npromotion, development, and implementation of PPPs. Performance will be measured by the \npresentation of a draft concession law to the State Council in 2015. \n                                                \n5  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2011.

The TA  is  an  initiative  under  pillar  2\u2014the  enabling  environment\u2014of ADB\u2019s  Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020.8 The TA will deepen awareness of the legal \nand regulatory environment needed for PPPs to deliver municipal and other public services.9 It \nwill  provide  observations  and  suggestions  on  measures  that  can  be  adopted  through  the \nfinalization of the PRC\u2019s concession law, drawing on international best practice. The bulk of the \nTA project\u2019s support will support the submission of a strengthened draft law to the State Council. \nThe TA will also provide follow-on support to assist the consideration and refinement of the law. \n13.  The TA will provide four outputs. Output 1 will be a stocktake of lessons from the PRC \nand other countries with PPP laws and regulations. Close attention will be paid to insights from \n(i) countries with active PPP programs, (ii) the experience with international standards such as \nthe United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Legislative Provisions for \nPPPs and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Basic Elements of a \nLaw on Concession Agreements, and (iii) the PRC\u2019s sector- and location-specific concession \nregulations.  Consideration  will  also  be  given  to  related  laws  and  regulations,  such  as \ngovernment procurement laws. The scope of PPP laws and their integration into the institutional \nenvironment will be examined to identify lessons relevant to the PRC. \n14.  The output will be oriented towards the formalization and rational development of the \nPRC\u2019s PPP program, taking into account the existing legal framework. The observations will \nalso draw on consultations with market participants on matters including the extent to which \nexisting laws and regulations have (i) provided clear guidance, (ii) provided a streamlined \napproval process, and (iii) balanced the interests of the public and private partners in a PPP. \nWith the support of the TA, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) will \nlead the consultations. The output will draw on an international consultation which will provide \nsenior NDRC staff an exposure to international best practices for PPP laws.10 \n15.  Output 2 will be suggestions on the draft concession law. While this output will draw on \nthe broader PPP experience, consistent with the State Council\u2019s approval to prepare the law, \nthe focus will be on concessions. The priority issues that will be addressed to strengthen the \nlegal environment for PPPs are expected to include (i) the definition of concessions and the \ndetermination of their scope; (ii) the goals of the legislation; (iii) project selection, preparation, \nand implementation; (iv) roles, responsibilities, and authorities of key parties; (v) the protection \nof the reasonable rights of private sector partners and financiers to ensure efficient market \noperations; (vi)  the  management  of fiscal  and  other risks; (vii)  the reinforcement  of  open, \ncompetitive bidding as the norm and clear principles for the use of alternative procurement \nmethods on an exceptional basis; (viii) the tailoring of government procurement systems for \nPPPs; (ix) dispute resolution; and (x) the streamlining of PPP approvals. \n16.  Output 2 will be provided as an initial set of recommendations based on output 1 and \ninput on specific topics selected on a demand-led basis. A research or issues paper will be \nprepared on topics agreed upon with the NDRC. The output may also support the preparation of \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

Output 3 will be a review of potential legal and regulatory amendments. It will support the \nformulation and review of proposals by government agencies and other stakeholders, drawing \non the deliverables of outputs 1 and 2. The NDRC will lead meetings, consultations, and \nworkshops to encourage discussion of observations and suggestions prepared under the TA, \nand to ensure they are reviewed by international and national experts. The dialogue will aim to \nidentify and resolve any tensions between the draft concession law and other PRC laws, such \nas bidding and procurement laws. At least one workshop will be conducted in a city outside \nBeijing. This output will support the activities of a group of external experts established by the \nNDRC to assist with the preparation of the concession law. \n18.  Output 3 will support at least three key events. First, a seminar will be held to discuss \nthe PPP-related practices in the PRC and the demands of the PPP legislation, and to seek \ncomments on a revised draft of the concession law. Relevant departments of the State Council, \nas well as the central and local governments, will be invited to participate in the seminar. \nSecond,  a  seminar  will  be  held  to  introduce the  experience from  other  countries  on  PPP \nlegislation and management. The research results of international and national experts will be \nshared  with  relevant  departments  of  the  State  Council,  as  well  as  the  central  and  local \ngovernments, to unify their understanding on the necessity and urgency of the concession law. \nThird, a workshop will be conducted to promote the TA\u2019s findings to senior decision makers in \norder  to  foster  support  for  the  concession  law.  This  will  include  representatives  from  the \nNational People\u2019s Congress and the State Council. \n19.  Output 4 will be a widely accessible publication in English and Chinese targeted at \nsenior decision makers. This may be in the form of ADB\u2019s Observations and Suggestions series. \nThe publication will draw on outputs 1\u20133 to disseminate information on a plan for the PRC\u2019s \nlegal and regulatory environment. \n20.  The TA will effectively use ADB\u2019s TA and publications in other member countries on PPP \nlegislation and regulation. It will seek to add value and avoid duplication of other activities \nsupported by ADB, and will coordinate with ongoing support from other development partners, \nincluding the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development, the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom, and the World Bank Group. \n21.  Intra-  and  interagency  dialogue  and  cooperation  on  PPPs  and  inputs  from  other \nstakeholders, including market participants, is one of the key assumptions of the TA. Another \nimportant  assumption  is  that  the  NDRC  will  make  sufficient  staff  time  available  for  TA \nmanagement. The key risks to success include the following: (i) complementary initiatives that \nmay be required cannot be implemented on a timely basis, (ii) competing policy priorities \ndisplace PPPs, and (iii) suitable consultants cannot be identified in a timely manner. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of meeting space, staff, other services to the consultants, \nassistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The NDRC will be the executing agency. The detailed work plan of the consultant team \nwill be updated and agreed upon by the NDRC and ADB as the team is mobilized. The NDRC \nhas  established  a  working  group  of  relevant  departments  to  guide  the  preparation  of  the \nconcession law; this group can also work with ADB to direct the TA consultant team. The \nimplementing agency will be the NDRC\u2019s Department of Laws and Regulations. \n24.  The NDRC will coordinate with government authorities and other stakeholders, and \nassign counterpart staff to assist the consultants. The NDRC will coordinate the day-to-day work \nof the consultants with ADB and will be responsible for the meetings, local consultations, \nworkshops, an international consultation, and publications. The timing, agenda, and participants \nof  the  meetings,  consultations,  and  workshops  will  be  agreed  by  the  NDRC  and  ADB. \nConsultants will only be paid after the NDRC accepts their research results and reports. ADB \nstaff will be engaged in the formulation of policy advice on the content of the concession law. \n25.  The TA will engage two national consultants\u2014a team leader and chief legal adviser, and \na coordinator\u2014for a total of 7 person-months. Two international consultants\u2014a legal adviser \nand a PPP adviser\u2014will be engaged for a total of 2.5 person-months. The team leader will have \noverall responsibility for coordinating the TA outputs. Given the small input and the need for \nquick mobilization, the consultants will be engaged individually. The national and international \nconsultants will be jointly responsible under the leadership of the team leader for outputs 1 and \n2 (observations and recommendations); the team leader will be primarily responsible for output \n3 (dialogue). The team leader and international consultants will be primarily responsible for \nturning the results of outputs 1\u20133 into the publication of output 4.  \n26.  National resource persons will also be engaged to provide input on specific topics as \nneeded. Most resource persons will operate through the experts group (para. 17). Because of \nthe diversity of skills required, the seniority of the experts, and the brief inputs, it is impractical to \nengage such experts as individual consultants. \n27.  The outline terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix \n3. ADB will engage the international and national consultants, and the resource persons, in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n28.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nthe satisfactory delivery of outputs, following the agreed time line and budget. To support \nmonitoring and evaluation, the team leader will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a \ndraft final report, and a final report concurrently to the NDRC and ADB. The main mechanism to \nmonitor and assess the TA will be review missions. The publications created by the TA will be \nprovided concurrently to the NDRC and ADB for dissemination to the government and, as \nappropriate, other stakeholders. The TA will start on 15 September 2014 and be completed on \n15 September 2016. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  a  Concession  Law  for \nInfrastructure and Public Services, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n      Data Sources   \n  Performance Targets and Indicators  and Reporting   \nDesign Summary  with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthened  PRC\u2019s enabling environment for PPPs  Asian Infrascope  The concession law is \nenabling  is ranked in the \u201cdeveloped\u201d country  benchmarking  adopted \nenvironment for  category of the Asian Infrascope by  index and  Internal PPP units are \nPPPs  2018 (2011 baseline: \u201cemerging\u201d  learning toolb  effective in building \ncategory)a  capacity and \nstrengthening the PPP \nenabling environment \nRisk \nComplementary reforms \nare required but cannot \nbe implemented on a \ntimely basis \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved legal  Draft concession law presented to the  Reports from the  Active interagency \nframework for the  State Council in 2015 (2013 baseline:  State Council  dialogue and cooperation \npromotion,  none)  NDRC  on PPPs \ndevelopment, and  Risk \nMedia reports \nimplementation of  Competing policy \nPPPs  priorities displace PPP \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
