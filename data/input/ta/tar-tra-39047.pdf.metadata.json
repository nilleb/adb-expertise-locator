ADB allocates Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources in accordance with its Policy \non Performance-Based Allocation.  The Board approved revisions to the policy on 10 December \n2004 (\u201cthe Policy\u201d). The revised policy requires annual country performance assessments for all \ncountries with access to ADF resources and anticipates strong client engagement during the \nperformance assessment process and in the subsequent use of ratings\u2019 diagnostics for the \ndesign of strategy and operations. The purpose of this technical assistance (TA) is to foster a \ndeeper understanding and ownership of the revised PBA policy among ADF borrowing clients \nand to acquaint them and other in-country stakeholders with revisions to the policy that were \napproved by the Board in December 2004. It is anticipated that this TA will be the first in a \nsequence of activities aimed at promoting deeper understanding and ownership of ADB\u2019s PBA \npolicy among DMC clients. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADF clients need to understand the operation of the PBA policy on three levels: (i) the \nnature of the performance criteria as well as the basis for and process of assessment; (ii) the \nframework for resource allocation decisions; and (iii) intended linkages between the policy, \nopportunities for dialogue and the design of country strategies and operations. Understanding of \nthe objectives of the policy and how it works is also essential if borrowing countries are to \nrespond  to the  incentives  it  provides  for  improved  performance.    The  public  disclosure  of \ncountry performance ratings, which will begin with the 2005 country performance assessments, \nmay also place new demands on ADF clients to explain and clarify perspectives a number of \nchallenges.  \n \n3.  Early communication about the intent and purpose of the revised policy with in-country \nstakeholders in the private sector and civil society is also important.  Misinterpretation and \nmisuse of ratings is more likely if stakeholders are ill informed about the objectives and scope of \nthe policy. Additionally, if \u201coutside\u201d scrutiny and independent commentary is to help improve the \nquality and robustness of ratings, the existing framework for ratings needs to be explained.  The \nrevised  policy  presents  opportunities  for  strengthened  partnerships  with  civil  society  and \nimproved access to in-country information and expertise.        \n \n4.  The concept for this TA emerged during ADF IX replenishment negotiations.  Borrower \nrepresentatives at these meetings expressed the view that DMCs needed to acquire a better \nunderstanding of the policy and its implementation.  Donor shareholders supported deeper \nclient engagement in the process.  In discussing the policy, Board members underlined the \nimportance  of  clearly  explaining  changes  to  ADF  clients  and  to  civil  society  in  borrowing \ncountries.   The TA framework (Appendix 1) reflects the views of these stakeholders.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n5.  The goal of the TA is to contribute to poverty reduction through the most effective use of \nADF resources.  It seeks to do so by providing technical support to client ADF countries and \nother in-country stakeholders that will promote deeper understanding and ownership of the \npolicy on the performance-based allocation of ADF resources.  This is a necessary basis for \nmeaningful client engagement in the performance assessment process, connected dialogue on ", "2     \nstrategy  and  operations  and,  ultimately,  the  effectiveness  with  which  ADF  resources  are \ndeployed.  \n \n6.  The purpose of the TA is to establish in-country capacity that can support ownership of \nthe PBA policy, and that will promote improved policies and institutions. The TA will also \ncontribute to heightened public awareness of the basis for the allocation of ADF resources and \nwill contribute to strengthened institutional accountability. \n \n7.  Key outputs will be two regional workshops.  One covering South Asia, East and Central \nAsia, Mekong and Southeast Asia developing member countries with access to ADF will be held \nin Bangkok, Thailand.  Another workshop for Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) \nwith access to ADF will be held in either Suva, Fiji Islands or in Auckland, New Zealand.  \nOutputs will include a report on the assessments of participants, and a set of training and \ninformation materials on PBA.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Each  workshop  will  have  two  modules  catering  to  the  differentiated  interests  of \nborrowing  clients  and  civil  society  stakeholders  in  the  PBA.  The  first  module  would  bring \ntogether senior technical staff from ADF borrowing countries, Ministries of Finance or equivalent \ncounterpart agencies.   Each borrowing country would be invited to nominate two staff to attend \nthe designated workshop.   The first module will be of two days duration. It is expected that \nparticipants would have the ability and be in a position to disseminate information within their \nhome country. It is also expected that Resident Mission (RM) staff or staff from Headquarters \ndirectly involved in the country performance assessments would participate in these workshops. \n \n9.  The second module of the workshop will be of one day\u2019s duration and will involve \nconsultations  with  private  sector  and  civil  society  representatives  from  each  country.   \nParticipation by two representatives from each country would be supported under the TA. RMs \nwill endorse nominations. Suitable participants may be selected from the media, academia, \nbusiness associations, or institutions that espouse transparency and accountability. Participants \nshould have an established reputation for independent commentary on development affairs. \nThis initial introduction to the policy on the performance based allocation of ADF resources \nwould subsequently be followed up in-country.  In-country consultations on country performance \nassessments and ratings would be led by RM staff drawing on inputs by participants. \n \n10.  The activities covered during workshop will: \n \na.  Explain to relevant government officials the nature of performance based allocation \nsystems. \n \nb.  Describe  and  explain  ADB\u2019s  revised  PBA  policy  and  linkage  to  policies  in \nInternational Development Association of the World Bank Group (IDA) and other \ninstitutions.    \n \nc.  Clarify the nature of the performance assessment and the role for country authorities \nand others in the assessment process. \n \nd.  Explain the allocation process and the uses of ADF funds. \n \ne.  Explain the ADF IX grants framework. \n ", "    3\n  \nf.  Explain the nature of the disclosure procedures and the mechanisms that ADB will \nmake available to country authorities to express their views. \n \ng.  Initiate consultations with developing member countries (DMCs) that will contribute to \nthe mid-term review of PBA in ADF IX. \n \nh.  Begin consultations with civil society on a.\u2013g. above. \n \n11.  ADB  professional  staff  from  the  PBA  focal  point,  will  take  the  lead  in  conducting \nworkshop activities. Given alignment between ADB\u2019s country performance criteria and those of \nthe  IDA,  and  overlap  in  client  borrowers,  opportunities  for  collaboration  with  IDA  in  these \nactivities will be explored. Consultants will assist in the preparations for the workshop and will \nsupport staff. A provisional agenda for each module is attached as Appendix 2.  Presentations \nwould be supplemented by smaller break-out sessions and roundtable discussions.   Participant \nwould receive a package of information materials and other relevant knowledge resources. \n \nC.  Costs and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program.  This will support the travel costs, accommodation and a stipend for \nparticipants, and pay for consultancy services.   The participation of RM and headquarters staff \nwill be financed from the relevant administrative budgets.  TA cost estimates and a financing \nplan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency.  The PBA Focal Point located in the Office of Director \nGeneral, Strategy and Policy Department, will administer the TA, in close cooperation with \noperations departments, RMs and host country governments. It is also anticipated that IDA will \ncontribute to the workshops. The TA will be implemented by ADB in consultation with host \ngovernments of each workshop location. \n \n14.  The TA implementation period will be from March 2005 to May 2005.  Collaboration with \nhost country governments is expected to involve mainly logistical and protocol aspects of the \norganization of the workshops. The TA will engage an international consultant for a total of 2 \nperson-months intermittently over the project implementation periods and a total of 2 person-\nmonths of domestic consultant. The international consultant, who has proven knowledge and \nexperience in PBA methods, will be assisted by a domestic consultant. The terms of reference \nfor the consultants are set out in Appendix 4. The consultants will be engaged as individuals in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering TA not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000, to be financed on a grant basis for \nRegional Capacity Building Workshop on Performance-Based Allocation of ADF Resources, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
