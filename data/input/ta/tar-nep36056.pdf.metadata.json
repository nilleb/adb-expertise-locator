INTRODUCTION \n1.  In October 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) undertook an analysis of public \ndebt sustainability of Nepal to provide inputs on foreign and domestic borrowing for the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan (FY2003-2007). Based on the findings of the analysis, during the Country \nProgramming  Confirmation  Mission  fielded,  in  December  2001,  the  Government  of  Nepal \nrequested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) for improving the Government\u2019s debt \nmanagement capacity. Advisory TA on Public Debt Management was included in the country \nnonlending program for 2002.1 A Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 26 September 2002 to \n11 October 2002. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government regarding the \nTA\u2019 s objectives, scope, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, terms of reference \nfor consultants, and counterpart support. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Given the significant savings-investment gap and large fiscal and external deficits in \nNepal, the role of public borrowing as an instrument of financing development expenditure has \nbeen particularly significant to meet the Government\u2019s poverty reduction goal. Nepal\u2019s public \ndebt outstanding is currently about $3.5 billion, 62% of gross domestic product (GDP), of which \nforeign debt is about $2.7 billion, 48% of GDP, and domestic debt is about $0.8 billion, 14% of \nGDP.  A  substantial  portion  of  development  expenditure,  averaging  about  56%,  has  been \nfinanced over the previous 5 years through foreign assistance. The domestic borrowing as a \nshare of the total government borrowing and foreign grants has increased significantly from 19% \nin the 1990s to 27% in FY2002. Government debt service absorbs roughly one third of the \ncountry\u2019s revenue. While this debt service to revenue ratio is still manageable, it is increasing, \npartly due to the declining ratio of government revenue to GDP. However, the debt stock to \nrevenue ratio is already serious at 280%,2 though a large component is highly concessional. In \naddition to the existing debt balance, the recent sharp economic downturn since mid-2001 has \nhad a serious adverse impact on the Government\u2019s fiscal position. The situation is not likely to \nbe reversed in the near future. In view of this, it is imperative that public debt be managed \nefficiently to enable the Government to maximize development impact without undermining the \ncountry\u2019s ability to meet its medium- and long-term debt obligations. \n \n3.  Realizing  the  crucial  importance  of  public  debt  management,  the  Government \nestablished the Debt Management Unit (DMU) under the Economic Affairs and Policy Division \n(EAPD) of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in December 1996 with responsibility for recording \nloan details and transactions on domestic and external debt. In 1997, a computer-based debt \nrecording and management system (CS-DRMS) was installed at DMU with assistance from the \nDepartment  of  International  Development  (DFID)  to  enhance  the  debt  data  recording, \nprocessing and reporting capacity of MOF. While a debt database was established and the \nusers of the system were trained under the DFID assistance, the debt database has not been \nupdated and the system has not been operational since March 2000, when the DFID project \nended. \n \n4.  An  ADB  economic consultation mission was fielded in October 2001 to assess the \nsustainability  of  public  debt  and  its  management.  Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the \nmission, the Government relocated the server to the Financial Comptroller General\u2019s Office \n(FCGO) and has begun updating external loan data. A plan for upgrading the system is under \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 April 2002 (Internet edition). \n2  The benchmark for heavily indebted poor country (HIPC) eligibility is 250%. ", "2 \nconsideration of the Government. The Government is now keen to ensure that this integrated \ndebt management system is maintained properly, and that reports are generated to provide \ninputs to the formulation of a borrowing policy and strategy. \n \n5.  The Government noted a number of weaknesses encountered in building up capacity in \npublic debt management. Some of the problems encountered were (i) the inadequate legal and \nregulatory framework, which failed to define without ambiguity the roles and responsibilities of \nthe concerned agencies engaged in loan operations over a complete loan cycle; (ii) conflicting \ninstitutional interests among the agencies without any effective coordinating mechanism, which \nconstrained an electronic link among FCGO, MOF, and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB); (iii) inability \nto institutionalize the debt management function in any of these three agencies; (iv) inability to \nretain trained staff, partly due to the lack of institutional commitment and weak staff capacity, \nparticularly in the area of debt analysis; and (v) lack of a monitoring mechanism for debt \nmanagement activities. \n \n6.  The Government identified a number of areas where additional work is  required to \nenable it to effectively manage public debt. The Government and ADB have agreed that efforts \nare urgently needed to address (i) the weak legislative and regulatory framework, (ii) inadequate \ninstitutional  structures  and  coordination  mechanisms  among  the  concerned  government \nagencies, (iii) problems associated with maintaining the loan database in the debt management \nsystem, (iv) lack of demand from users such as policy makers and the public for the reports that \ncould be produced by the debt management system, and (v) inadequate capacity to produce \nanalytical  reports  useful  for  debt  policy-making process. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nCountry Strategy and Program, which emphasizes the importance of institutional strengthening \nin Nepal. It also builds upon lessons learned from past experience that lack of adequate support \nfor institution building hinders project sustainability. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The  overall  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  strengthen  Nepal\u2019s  institutional capacity for \nsustainable and effective public debt management. The TA is also designed to complement the \nGovernment\u2019s  initiatives  in  the  area  of  improving  public  financial  management  with  other \nassistance from ADB and other development partners.  The TA will (i) strengthen the legal, \nregulatory, and institutional framework for public sector borrowing; (ii) improve its capacity for \nformulating  debt  policy  and  for  planning;  and  (iii)  strengthen  debt  accountability  and \ntransparency by improving debt recording and accounting.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n8.  The TA will cover (i) reviewing and consolidating the legal, regulatory and institutional \nframework for public sector borrowing; (ii) establishing a debt planning and policy capacity; and \n(iii) maintaining a loan database using an upgraded debt management system for ensuring \ntimely debt service payments and transparency in public sector borrowing operations. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n9.  Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework. This component of the TA will review \nthe  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  public  sector  borrowing  and  its \nmanagement. It will cover both external and domestic borrowing and will include government \nborrowing, government-guaranteed borrowing of state enterprises, and government onlending \nof borrowed funds. Existing laws and regulations including the Fiscal Responsibility Act in New ", "    3 \nZealand will be studied with those of a few developing countries, and recommendations made \nfor drafting a comprehensive public debt management law. It will deal with all stages of the loan \ncycle for public sector borrowing and assign specific responsibility for public debt management. \n \n10.  The TA will support the Government in preparing operational procedures for the effective \nuse of loan funds and in monitoring loan utilization with a view to improving absorptive capacity.  \nThese procedures will clarify the roles of each agency involved in public sector loan operations.  \nIt will also result in the formulation of a policy for the issue and monitoring of government \nguarantees, although the Government has recently not issued guarantees. This is intended to \nminimize  the  risks  and  costs  arising  from  defaults  on  explicit  guarantees  issued  by  the \nGovernment. Similarly, a policy for onlending borrowed funds will be formulated and procedures \nfor monitoring such loans will be prepared so that MOF will have complete knowledge of the use \nof onlent funds, unlike at present. \n \n11.  The TA will propose effective institutional arrangements for coordination among the \nagencies involved in public sector borrowing at all stages of the loan cycle.  Further, sustainable \ndebt  recording  and  management  arrangements  will  be  institutionalized  to  enable  the \nGovernment to maintain an up-to-date and comprehensive database on public sector debt.  \nSuch a database will enable debt policy and portfolio analyses to be undertaken as an input to \nthe formulation of a borrowing policy and strategy for the public sector. \n \n12.  The TA will enable the steering committee to review and make recommendations to the \nGovernment on a range of public debt management issues such as (i) the formulation of a new \nPublic Debt Management Law; (ii) the preparation of a loan operations manual, and policies for \nissue and management of government guarantees and onlending funds borrowed from abroad \nby the Government; (iii) the establishment of a Public Debt Coordination Committee (PDCC) \nconsisting of the concerned agencies to improve coordination among them for data collection \nand policy analysis, adopt benchmarks for leading debt indicators, and formulate a borrowing \npolicy and strategy for implementing it; (iv) the establishment of a Debt Policy and Management \nCenter (DPMC) in MOF to undertake debt policy and portfolio analysis, function as a secretariat \nfor  PDCC,  coordinate  closely  with  the  activities  of  the  existing  Open  Market  Operations \nCommittee (OMOC), and prepare quarterly and half yearly status reports on public debt for \nDPMC; and (v)  the acceptance of the Loan and Investment Division (LID) in FCGO as the \nlocation of the central database for public sector borrowing with budgeted positions to maintain \nan up-to- date and complete database. The TA will study and recommend to the steering \ncommittee the need for establishing a high-level National Debt Council to set ceilings for \ndomestic and government borrowing and provide overall guidance on public sector borrowings. \n \n13.  Establishing a Debt Planning and Policy Capacity.  Capacity-building efforts will be \ndirected toward DPMC, which will become the focal point for debt analysis and policy for the \ngovernment. It will require close coordination among FCGO, MOF, and NRB under the guidance \nof PDCC. DPMC will prepare medium-term estimates of the resource gap as an input to the \nformulation of a medium-term borrowing policy, in close consultations with the National Planning \nCommission for checking macroeconomic consistency. This policy will adopt critical values for \npublic debt indicators for Nepal. The borrowing policy and debt sustainability analysis will enable \nannual external and domestic borrowing levels to be estimated. \n \n14.  OMOC currently functions in NRB. It deals with the timetable for debt issues necessary \nto  achieve  the  domestic  borrowing  ceiling  and  the  instruments  to  be  used  for  mobilizing \nresources. There is no similar committee that prepares a strategy for external borrowing that \nwould enable the Government to make choices on lenders, markets to access, and currencies ", "4 \nof borrowing. An annual strategy will be necessary when nonconcessional borrowings including \ninternational capital market borrowing are contemplated, while it is less important now when the \nbulk of the external borrowing is from concessional bilateral and multilateral sources. Until such \ntime, DPMC will prepare a strategy in consultation with the Foreign Aid Coordination Division of \nMOF  and  submit  it  to  PDCC  for  approval.  The  TA  will  also  review  the  coordination \narrangements among DPMC, OMOC, and PDCC. \n \n15.  Debt analysis will require access to the loan database and use of the facilities in the debt \nmanagement software for analytical work. Given the difficulties of appointing qualified staff to \nMOF to undertake analytical work on public debt, consideration may be given to contracting out \nperiodic debt analyses to meet the debt policy needs of the Government. \n \n16.  Strengthening Debt Recording and Accounting.  The UNIX-based computer-based \ndebt recording and management system used in Nepal will be upgraded to a Windows-based \nversion  to  take  advantage  of  technological  improvements  and  overcome  some  technical \nproblems. New servers will be purchased for FCGO and firm communications links established \nbetween  it  and  new  workstations  that  will  be  purchased  for  MOF  and  NRB.    Additional \nproprietary software required for the new system to function will also be purchased. \n \n17.  The role of LID in FCGO to take responsibility for data entry on external borrowing and \nthat of the Public Debt Department of NRB for data entry on domestic borrowing and exchange \nrate  data  obtained  from  the  Foreign  Exchange  Department  will  be  formalized.  The  loan \ndatabase will be migrated to the new version of the debt management system at the time it is \ninstalled. Training on the use of the new system will be provided to staff for data entry and the \nproduction of single loan and aggregate debt reports at the time the system is installed. More \nadvanced training in the use of the software will be provided for selected staff after the \ninstallation of the new system. These staff will be responsible for training a wider group of staff \nin the FCGO, MOF and NRB in the use of the system.  \n \n18.  Dissemination of Public Debt Data.  Debt awareness seminars will be held during the \nTA for senior policy makers and selected members of the public including the media. Action will \nbe taken during the TA to place the first annual Status Report on Public Debt on the web site of \nMOF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is \n$256,000 and the local currency cost is $244,000 equivalent. ADB will provide a grant of \n$400,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $144,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $100,000 equivalent to provide \noffice  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA;  MOF, FCGO, and NRB will be the \nimplementing agencies. While the TA activities will be guided by a steering committee that will \nconsist of senior officers of MOF, FCGO, NRB, and the National Planning Commission and be \nchaired by the secretary of MOF, the primary implementation responsibility will be vested in a \ntechnical committee. The technical committee will be chaired by the joint secretary of EAPD of ", "    5 \nMOF and include senior officers from the Foreign Aid Coordination Division of MOF, FCGO, and \nthe Public Debt Department of NRB. The joint secretary of EAPD will also function as the project \ndirector,  with  assistance  from  FCGO  and  NRB.  The  steering  committee  will  meet  at  the \nbeginning of the project and every 6 months thereafter to guide the TA and resolve policy \nissues.  The  technical  committee  will  meet  every  3  months  to  discuss  TA  progress  and \nimplementation issues. Appendix 3 sets out the implementation arrangements. The TA team \nleader will be responsible for managing the funds for procurement of equipment, seminars, and \nmeetings. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period from January 2003 to June 2004. \nTripartite  meetings  of  the  Government,  TA  consultants,  and  ADB  will  be  chaired  by  the \nsecretary of MOF, and held every 4 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second \nyear to review TA implementation priorities, address issues arising during TA implementation, \nand provide guidance to the TA consultants.  \n \n22.  The TA will provide 8 person-months of international and 23 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The international consultants will be skilled and experienced in the legal, \nregulatory, and institutional aspects of public debt management, debt policy and planning, and a \ncomputerized debt management system. The domestic consultants will be selected to cover \nlegal, institutional, and debt policy and planning issues, and to support the computerized debt \nmanagement system. Consultancy services and training needs will be coordinated with other \ngovernment projects assisted by ADB and other important aid agencies in the area of public \nfinancial  management.  As  the  TA  identifies  the  need  for  other  specialists,  the  initial \nspecifications might be modified. Such modification will be approved by the steering committee \nand ADB. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n23.  The TA consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will support the purchase of computer \nequipment and software, and the improvement of services for the web sites. The web site at \nMOF will strengthen public dissemination of public debt data. Equipment and systems procured \nunder the TA will be handed over to the concerned agencies upon completion of the TA.  \n \n24.  The consultants will prepare planning and progress reports describing TA activities and \nwill flag institutional and technical issues. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report \nincluding  a  detailed  TA work program, to be submitted 1 month after TA implementation \ncommences;  (ii)  reports  for  the  tripartite  meetings,  indicating  progress  made,  outstanding \nissues, and work plan for the period until the next meeting; (iii) a draft final report to the \nGovernment, to be submitted 1 month before TA completion; and (iv) a final report at the \nconclusion of the consulting services. All reports will be submitted to the steering committee and \nADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to \nthe Government of Nepal for Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Public Debt Management, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Risks and \nSummary  and Targets  Mechanisms  Assumptions \n       \nGoal    Milestones for:    \n       \nImproved capacity for  \u2022  Strengthened legal and  \u2022  Completing reviews  \u2022  Delays in  \neffective loan utilization and  regulatory framework for  and introducing  Institutionalising \npublic debt management  public sector borrowing  regulatory  and  LID as the location \n  institutional  of  the central debt \n  changes  database at the \n    start of the TA and  \n    the DPMC later in \n    the TA \n     \n\u2022  Improved capacity for  \u2022  Preparation of   \u2022  No demand from \nplanning and formulating   medium-term  senior policy  \n       debt policy         borrowing policy  makers for  \n    periodic portfolio \n    and debt analysis \n     \n\u2022  Maintain up\u2013to-date loan  \u2022  Installation of  \u2022  Procedures not \ndatabase using new debt  software, training  established for \nmanagement software  In its use, and   training new staff \nupdating the   in debt recording  \ndatabase  and management  \nwhen trained staff \nmove on to other \nassignments \n       \nPurpose       \n    Covers all items in  Covers all items in \n    Targets  Targets \n       \nAssist the Government in  \u2022  Review of legal and  \u2022  TA review reports  \u2022  Lack of   \nimproving its capacity for  regulatory  framework   \u2022  Periodic reports of  government \npublic debt management and  leading to drafting new   team leader and  commitment  to  \nloan utilization  public debt management  senior adviser   institutionalize \n  law   \u2022  Periodic aggregate  public  debt \n  \u2022  Preparation of loan  debt reports and  management as a  \n  operations  manual  analysis  function of the \n  containing procedures for  \u2022  Evaluation of  FCGO,MOF, and \n  government borrowing ,  training results   NRB \n  government guarantees,  achieved during TA  \u2022  Availability of \n  and onlending  adequate qualified \n  \u2022  Maintenance of up-to- staff to undergo \n  date loan database  training in debt \n  \u2022  Periodic loan portfolio   management \n  and debt analysis that is  \u2022  Availability of \n  institutionalized and   adequate IT staff to \n  circulated extensively to  maintain a \n  political leadership and  computerized loan \n  senior policy makers.  database \n     \n     \n     \n   \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance Indicators  Monitoring  Risks and \nSummary  and Targets  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nOutputs       \n    Covers all items in  Covers all items in \n    Targets  Targets \n       \n1.
