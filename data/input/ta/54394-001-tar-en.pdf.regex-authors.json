INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide a knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to expand ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \noperations (NSO) in Mongolia. The TA will focus on (i) increasing the private sector\u2019s awareness \nof ADB\u2019s financial products, investment principles, and eligibility criteria; and (ii) enhancing project \nreadiness and implementation.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and the goals of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nPrivate Sector Operations, 2019\u20132024.1 The TA is included in the country operations business \nplan for Mongolia, 2021.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Over the past 3 years, ADB has intensified its NSO efforts and approved four projects in \nMongolia totaling $62.1 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (as of May 2021).3 Before \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, ADB increased the number of missions fielded to \nMongolia from the resident mission in Beijing and ADB headquarters in Manila to identify and \nnegotiate  small-scale  private  sector  projects  in  the  infrastructure,  financial  institutions, \nagribusiness, and social sectors. The government has recognized and appreciated this effort. \n \n4.  The government has highlighted the importance of a more dynamic private sector to \nMongolia\u2019s future economic prospects. In policy priorities, the government has identified an \nambitious infrastructure pipeline and recognizes that private sector financing is essential for the \nsuccessful implementation of this pipeline.4 Over the longer term, Mongolia wants to develop \ndynamic, private-sector-led economic sectors in the non-mining space to support continued \nefforts  to  diversify  the  economy.5 The  government  has  underlined  the  catalytic  role  that \ninternational financial institutions (IFIs) can play to provide finance, build capacity, and give \nincreased confidence to prospective investors. Thus, the Ministry of Finance requested ADB to \nfurther expand its efforts to reach out to private sector companies and to increase its pipeline of \nNSO in the country. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s nonsovereign engagement adds significant value to private sector financing in \nMongolia,  and  ADB  coordinates  closely  with  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD) and the World Bank Group\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC), the \ntwo other major actors in private sector operations. ADB\u2019s absence in the traditional mining sector \nallows for a dedicated focus on supporting and developing the non-mining sectors, a unique \nsituation among IFIs. ADB is also well placed to use its large sovereign portfolio to complement \nthe success and lessons from NSO with upstream efforts to strengthen the investment climate\u2014\nan important priority for ADB in Mongolia because of the recent stagnation in Mongolia\u2019s business \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The title of the TA was revised to better describe its scope. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 January 2021. \n3  The four projects are:) (i) Gender Inclusive Dairy Value Chain Project (2019), (ii) Sermsang Khushig Khundii Solar \nProject (2019), (iii) Senior Loans to XacBank and TenGer Financial Group for Supporting Micro, Small, Medium-\nSized Enterprises and Leasing Finance (2019), and (iv) Tavan Bogd COVID-19 Wheat Supply Chain Liquidity \nSupport Project (2020).  \n4  State Great Khural. 2020.

Ulaanbaatar. \n \n \n ", "2 \n \nclimate reforms in recent years.6 This complementarity between NSO and sovereign work and \nthe focus on investment climate reform will be a core priority of the upcoming country partnership \nstrategy for Mongolia, and the proposed TA will be a key part of this approach.7 ADB is already \nshowing leadership among the IFIs in complementing NSO with upstream sovereign work. For \nexample, ADB is coordinating a joint position paper on the investment climate in Mongolia with \nEBRD and IFC. This builds on the excellent collaboration between ADB and peer IFIs at the \ntransaction level, which will continue to underpin ADB\u2019s approach on NSO.  \n \n6.  The success of fully expanding ADB\u2019s NSO financing depends on the depth of ADB\u2019s \nengagement with the country\u2019s private sector, which is a time- and resource-intensive process, \nespecially for smaller transactions. Further outreach to the business community will require \nadditional human resources to provide the necessary expertise and ignite the momentum for NSO. \nChallenging  economic  and  geographic  conditions  call  for  a  further  boost  of  the  business \ndevelopment capacity within the country. With this TA, ADB will recruit experienced business \ndevelopment professionals to reach out to private sector companies and state-owned enterprises \nand drive new project pipeline growth in Mongolia on behalf of ADB. The TA will complement \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s (PSOD) business development efforts, market \nresearch, transaction support, and portfolio management activities in the country. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: NSO financing and partnerships with various \nsectors in the Mongolian economy supported (Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020).8  The TA \nwill have the following outcome: readiness and design quality of ADB\u2019s NSO financing improved.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Project identification and preparation capacity of Mongolia\u2019s businesses \nwith high development impact strengthened. This output will identify and support commercially \nviable private sector companies to generate a beneficial social or environmental impact and \nimprove their capacity to get access to long-term capital in the international financial markets. \nThrough workshops and seminars, the TA will support selected private sector companies to \nprepare  and  implement  projects  with  high  development  impact  in  energy,  infrastructure, \nmanufacturing, agribusiness, and services. This will also help the private sector better understand \nessential features of projects that ADB will consider for direct financial assistance. Private sector \nparticipants will be identified based on available market studies and ADB\u2019s assessments. \n \n9.  Output 2: Knowledge of ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operation financing and private sector \nawareness of ADB\u2019s financial instruments, investment principles, and eligibility criteria \nimproved. This output will help strengthen the potential private sector clients\u2019 ability to benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s NSO financing through outreach workshops. During project implementation, the TA \nwill organize at least three events each year: one project promotion workshop, one thematic \nseminar,  and  one  outreach  conference.  The  TA-supported  knowledge  products,  including \nbrochures and product notes, will enhance the private sector\u2019s awareness of ADB\u2019s assistance \n \n6 For example, Mongolia has fallen from 59 in the Doing Business Survey in 2014 to 81 in 2020. \n7 This is scheduled for approval in the third quarter of 2021. \n8 Government of Mongolia. 2016.

ADB will also explore the preparation of background sectoral \nknowledge products such as diagnostic studies and/or mapping of private sector players. This will \nbe explored in coordination with peer IFIs to avoid unnecessary duplication of knowledge products \nand to better coordinate knowledge efforts. The focus of these events and knowledge products \nwill be the non-mining sectors. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n11.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff \nremuneration, domestic transportation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB Mongolia Resident Mission and PSOD will co-lead \nadministration and will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants; organize workshops; and \nprovide staff to act as resource persons in the workshop. \n \n13.
