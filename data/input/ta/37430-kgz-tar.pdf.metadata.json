INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic requested technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the Second Community-Based Early Childhood \nDevelopment Project. The TA is included in the Kyrgyz Republic country strategy and program \nupdate for 2006\u20132008,1 and is programmed for 2006.2 The Community-Based Early Childhood \nDevelopment  Project  (CBECDP)  began  in  March  2004,3 with  implementation  progressing \nsatisfactorily. Because the loan is small ($10.5 million equivalent), the CBECDP was restricted \nto the 12 poorest raions (districts). The Government and ADB agreed that a follow-on project \nwould be included in the 2007 lending program to build on experience gained by the CBECDP \nand extend the coverage of CBECDP activities to other raions. Fact-finding for the TA was \ncarried out in January\u2013February 2006, and an understanding reached with the Government on \nthe TA\u2019s impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Early childhood development (ECD) refers to physical and psychosocial development \nduring the first several years of life. Evidence is growing that ECD has long-lasting effects and is \ncritical to human development. Children who are healthy, stimulated, and well nurtured during \nthis period tend to do better in school and have a better chance of developing the skills required \nto contribute to social and economic development. Before the collapse of the former Soviet \nUnion in 1991, young children in the Kyrgyz Republic received a comprehensive package of \nECD services, comprising child health care, nutrition, and nursery and/or preschool programs. \nPregnant  women  had  access  to  antenatal  care  that  helped  maintain  maternal  health  and \nmitigated risks associated with pregnancy. Poverty was far less prevalent than it is today. The \nfavorable ECD situation changed dramatically in the decade after 1991, with ECD deteriorating \nlargely as a consequence of economic contraction, increased poverty, and declines in social \nservices. Child health and nutrition worsened, a large number of preschool institutions were \nclosed  down,  and  parents  were  left  without  sufficient  resources  or  knowledge  to  care  for \nchildren at home. The CBECDP was designed to arrest the deterioration in ECD.  \n \n3.  Socioeconomic indicators have improved over the last few years. Per capita nominal \nGDP increased from $322 in 2002 to $430 in 2004, while poverty incidence declined from 52% \nin 2000 to 46% in 2004. Despite some signs of improvement, especially in the 12 raions \ncovered by the CBECDP, significant challenges to ECD remain. Recognizing the positive effects \nand potential of the CBECDP, the Government proposes to expand its investment in ECD to \nother raions, and strengthen the sustainability of ECD activities. \n \n4.  Child Health and Nutrition. Child health and nutrition have been improving slowly but \nrequire  intensified  efforts  to  achieve  the  relevant  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs), \nincluding reduction of the infant mortality rate (IMR) and the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), and \nachievement of universal primary education.4 The IMR and U5MR are high for a country with (i) \nhigh education levels, (ii) universal immunization coverage, and (iii) an extensive network of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Kyrgyz Republic. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 March 2006. \n3  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKyrgyz Republic for the Community-Based Early Childhood Development Project. Manila.  \n4  Since they were adopted in 2000, the MDGs have become the most widely accepted yardstick of development \nefforts by governments. Specifically, the targets associated with these MDGs include reduction of IMR and U5MR \nby two thirds from 1990 to 2015 and achievement of a 100% net enrollment rate in primary education by 2015. \n ", "2   \nhealth care facilities.5 The proportion of infant deaths occurring during the neonatal period (the \nfirst  28  days  after  birth)  is  rising.  Common  infectious  diseases  (diarrhea  and  respiratory \ninfections) have been the major cause of infant deaths, but their significance has declined in \nrecent years. The decline may be partly attributed to the integrated management of childhood \nillnesses (IMCI). However, IMCI is less effective in reducing neonatal mortality. To further \nreduce the IMR, specific measures targeted at the neonatal period are required.  \n \n5.  Micronutrient deficiencies can cause various developmental delays and contribute to \nincreased morbidity and mortality. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and iron deficiency anemia \n(IDA)  have  been  major  public  health  problems  among  children  and  women.  Progress  in \ncontaining IDD and IDA is mixed. The prevalence of IDD, which increased 8\u201310 times in the \ndecade after 1991, is now expected to decrease because of progress toward universal salt \niodization. In 2005, about 90% of households regularly consumed iodized salt, but continuing \nefforts by the Government, private sector, civil society, and development agencies to achieve \nand sustain universal salt iodization are needed. However, IDA has not declined. According to \nthe 1997 Demographic Health Survey, 38% of women and 50% of children under the age of 3 \nsuffer from IDA. IDA prevention is complex, and requires a combination of (i) dietary change, (ii) \npromotion of fortified flour, and (iii) dietary supplementation for selected target groups such as \npregnant women.  \n   \n6.  Children\u2019s  Psychosocial  Development.  Because  data  on  children\u2019s  psychosocial \ndevelopment are scarce, the CBECDP is helping the Ministry of Education (MOE) assess \nchildren\u2019s psychosocial development.  Access to preschool programs is a serious problem, with \nmany villages lacking access to any preschool programs.6 The number of state preschool \ninstitutions declined significantly from 1,696 in 1990 to 402 in 2001, and subsequently increased, \nreaching  440  in  2004.  The  number  of  children  in  preschools  followed  the  same  pattern, \ndecreasing steadily from 151,500 in 1990 to 46,800 in 2001, and then increasing to 50,935 in \n2004; the latter equaled about 8% of children 1\u20137 years of age. MOE estimates that alternative \npreschools covered about 1,500 more children. On average, about 90% of available preschool \ncapacity is used, with substantial variations among raions.  \n \n7.  In the preschool concept adopted in 2005, MOE pledges equal access to preschool \nprograms  to  all  children,  and  has  initiated  several  new  approaches  to  achieve  this  goal. \nExpanding the network of alternative preschools and increasing the use of existing preschools \n(from the present 90% to 100%) are important measures for increasing preschool program \naccess. MOE has officially recognized alternative preschools in the new preschool standards \n(2005), and is working on a financing mechanism that will allow cost-sharing by the Government, \nlocal governments, and beneficiaries. MOE has also introduced the \u201c100 hours of preschool \nprogram\u201d to prepare children for school during the summer before they enter primary school. \nThe CBECDP supports the establishment of alternative preschools, including community-based \npreschools and preparatory courses.  \n \n8.  Child Care at Home and in the Community. The family is the primary caregiver for \nyoung children, and both the home and the community should provide a safe and nurturing \nenvironment  for  child  development.  The  CBECDP  baseline  survey  and  discussions  during \nparents\u2019 education sessions revealed that parents were not fully aware of the importance of their \nroles and had limited child care knowledge. Parents have significant unmet needs and demand \nfor ECD-related knowledge. The high community demand for financing under the CBECDP \n                                                 \n5  Official data underestimate IMR and U5MR because of underreporting by health care workers and delays in \nadjusting the definition of live births to the World Health Organization standards. \n6  According to the CBECDP baseline survey, only about 25% of villages in the 12 project raions have preschool \nprograms, of which about a quarter were community-based. ", "  3\nVillage Initiative Fund is indicative of the willingness of and potential for communities to support \nECD. \n \n9.  The CBECDP and Emerging Needs. The CBECDP has supported integrated health, \nnutrition,  and  psychosocial  development  activities.  It  has  implemented  interventions  to  (i) \nimprove primary health care for children, with a focus on preventing child deaths from common \ninfectious diseases; (ii) introduce behavioral changes to prevent micronutrient deficiencies; (iii) \nimprove access by poor children to preschool programs, especially through the establishment of \nalternative preschools; (iv) improve the quality of child care at home; (v) develop the capacity of \nlocal governments and communities to plan, implement, and monitor ECD activities; and (vi) \nimprove monitoring of development indicators for young children. These activities are highly \nrelevant and need to be built on and further developed and refined.  \n \n10.  Several important emerging issues are not adequately addressed under the CBECDP: (i) \nreducing neonatal deaths; (ii) establishing a viable essential-drug distribution mechanism; and \n(iii)  capacity  building  of  the  ECD  service  delivery  system,  with  a  focus  on  accreditation, \nattestation, and retention of health care workers, preschool teachers and caregivers, and social \nworkers.  The  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  Project  for  Reducing  Neonatal \nMortality7 is helping the Ministry of Health (MOH) (i) conduct an IMR survey, (ii) improve the \naccuracy of IMR data, and (iii) pilot measures to reduce neonatal mortality. The CBECDP has \nhelped improve and expand the IMCI, and plans to pilot drug distribution by a nongovernment \norganization in remote raions.  \n \n11.  The retention and recruitment of health care workers poses a serious challenge to \nprimary health care. Medical doctors have been emigrating for some years, and a more recent \nincrease in emigration among paramedical workers has worsened health care staff shortages. \nLow pay deters new medical college graduates from taking health care jobs, and MOH has had \ndifficulty filling vacancies and retaining staff in remote primary health care facilities. A similar \nsituation exists for preschools. Although alternative preschools can at present take advantage of \ndedicated retired teachers, securing qualified teachers is a potential problem as demand for \nalternative preschool teachers and caregivers increases and former preschool teachers age. \nSystematic upgrading of teachers\u2019 skills, starting from pre-service training, will also be required \nto ensure the quality of preschool programs. \n \n12.  External Assistance.  In addition to the CBECDP and the JFPR Project for Reducing \nNeonatal Mortality (para. 10), ADB has supported a regional JFPR project for improving nutrition \nof  poor  mothers  and  children,8 and  is  supporting  a  follow-on  regional  JFPR  project  for \nsustainable food fortification.9 The proposed project will build on the activities, experiences, and \nstudies of these projects. ADB is working closely with the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund \n(UNICEF), which is assisting the Kyrgyz Republic in child health interventions, including IMCI, \ntraining in neonatal care, and developing ECD materials.

The Law on Protection of the Kyrgyz People\u2019s Health clearly stipulates the \nstate\u2019s responsibility and the obligation of citizens to provide children with the living conditions \nrequired for sound physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Investing in ECD is \ndirectly relevant to the basic human development needs of the Kyrgyz Republic as set out in its \npoverty reduction strategy and the Education Strategy for 2010. Maternal and child health is a \nmajor  focus  of  the  second  MOH  health  reform  policy.  ADB  also  recognizes  that  ECD  is \ninstrumental  to  human  development  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  framework  policy  and \nstrategy for the education sector emphasizes that investment in ECD (i) leads to improved \nlearning capacity and reduced dropouts from school, and (ii) gives poor children a head start in \nbreaking out of the poverty cycle. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  to  improve  the  health,  nutrition,  and  psychosocial \ndevelopment of children up to 8 years of age. The outcome of the TA is a project design that will \nachieve this impact and is compatible with ADB financing requirements. The TA outputs are (i) a \nneeds assessment of the targeted populations, (ii) policy and sector analysis and training, and \n(iii) a project designed for ADB financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be guided by four principles: (i) targeting the poor; (ii) participatory project \ndevelopment; (iii) the integrated life-cycle approach, which addresses holistic development of \nchildren of different ages; and (iv) sustainability. The TA will build on experience gained and \nlessons learned from the CBECDP. Investment activities under the project are expected to \nfocus on selected poor raions that have not been covered by the CBECDP, while policy and \ncapacity-building activities will be organized nationwide. The raions will be selected before TA \ninception by the Government and ADB based on poverty data, and in consideration of coverage \nof other similar projects and/or programs. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2.  The expected outputs include the following. \n \n(i)  A needs assessment that will identify the problems of young children, their families, the \ncommunity, and frontline workers with regard to improving ECD, and constraints that \nhealth care workers, preschool teachers, and social workers are facing in delivering ECD \nservices.  The  TA  will  support  analysis  of  secondary  data,  surveys,  and  systematic \nqualitative research to assess (a) the ECD status and problems related to ECD of the \ntarget  populations  in  the  TA  raions;  (b)  child  care  practices  at  home  and  in  the \ncommunity; (c) access by children and families to ECD services, which include health \ncare, preschool education programs, and social protection; and (d) constraints faced by \nthe families and health care, preschool, and social workers.   \n \n(ii)  Policy  and  sector  analysis  and  training  will  identify  technical  measures  and  policy \ndevelopments required to improve ECD and to address problems identified by the needs \nassessment. The TA will support an ECD sector analysis comprising subsector analyses \nin child health, early child education, social protection for children, and child care at \nhome and in the community. The analysis will include identification of (a) problems and \nissues in improving quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of service delivery, budgetary \nsystems, human resources, and related policies; and (b) cost-effective and feasible \nsolutions.  Ongoing  activities  supported  by  the  Government  and  other  development \nagencies will be thoroughly reviewed. The TA consultants will conduct short training ", "  5\nand/or seminars for government staff on international best practices in key aspects of \nECD.  \n \n(iii)  A project suitable for ADB financing will be designed. The TA will prepare a project \nfeasibility study that will build on the design, implementation experience, and lessons \nlearned from the CBECDP. Best practice from other countries as well as innovations will \nbe introduced as appropriate. Project preparation will include detailed formulation of \nproject components, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, economic analysis, \nfinancial sustainability analysis, a plan for institutional and financial sustainability of the \nECD program, poverty and social impact assessments, and monitoring and evaluation \nframework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $471,000; $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining $71,000 \nequivalent will be financed by the Government and will cover office accommodation (including \nbasic  utilities),  counterpart  staff,  data  collection,  and  logistics  support  (Appendix  3).  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Executing Agency will be the Office of the President, which is also the Executing \nAgency for the CBECDP. The CBECDP project director will also be the project director for the \nTA.  A steering committee will be established by expanding the CBECDP steering committee to \ninclude  representatives  from  the  oblasts  (provinces)  covered  by  the  TA.  The  Steering \nCommittee will provide overall policy guidance. The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from \nSeptember 2006 to April 2007. ADB will engage an international consulting firm, in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers, which will provide 10 \nperson-months of international consultants and 36 person-months of domestic consultants with \nexpertise in team leadership, child health, maternal and child nutrition and early child education, \neconomic and financial analysis, social analysis, and coordination of oblast activities (Appendix \n4). Simplified technical proposals will be required, and the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod  used.  Consultants  will  procure  equipment  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  \n \n18.   The  CBECDP  project  management  office  (PMO)  will  be  closely  involved  with  TA \nimplementation to take full advantage of knowledge and experience gained under the CBCEDP. \nThe PMO project manager will act as the local team leader for the TA. TA consultants should \n(i) consult with the PMO in finalizing the TA implementation schedule, and organizing working \ngroup meetings and workshops; and (ii) regularly report to the PMO and the Office of the \nPresident and submit all reports to ADB, the PMO and the Office of the President. ADB will \nreview TA implementation jointly with the PMO and the Office of the President. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for preparing the Second Community-Based Early \nChildhood Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved health,  IMR in project raions  Statistics of national,  The Kyrgyz Republic will \nnutrition, and  (districts) reduced by  oblast (provincial), and  maintain its commitment \npsychosocial  20% from 2008 levels by  raion governments  to ECD.  \ndevelopment of children  2012      \nfrom birth to 8 years of       \nage  U5MR in project raions  Project baseline and  Modest economic growth \nreduced by 30% from  evaluation surveys  will continue and the \n2008 levels by 2012  poverty rate will not \n  increase. \nPsychosocial   \ndevelopment status  The political situation will \nmeasured by basic  be stable. \nlanguage, numeracy, and   \nlife skills of children   \nentering primary school   \nimproved by 30% from \nthe 2008 level by 2012  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design suitable for  MOU or appraisal signed  MOU  Various stakeholders will \nADB financing, and  by the Government and  actively participate in the \nagreed to by the  ADB   project design. \nGovernment and ADB   \n  Policy changes initiated \nunder the CBECDP will \nhave been adopted.  \n \nRisk \nFrequent changes in \nsenior government \nofficials may delay \ndecision-making. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.Completed needs  Needs assessment  Workshop and training  The political situation will \nassessment  report, sector reports, and  reports  be stable and \n2.Completed sector  feasibility study discussed    geographical access will \nanalysis and training  with and disseminated  Comments received from  remain free.  \n3.Completed feasibility  among stakeholders, and  stakeholders  \nstudy report   positive feedback   \n  received   \n   \nTraining conducted  \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Complete a needs assessment within 6 weeks of the TA inception.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic: \n \nThe project will help reduce poverty by enhancing the physical and psychosocial development of young children. \nInvestments in early childhood development (i) yield high returns to individuals and the society; and (ii) have long-\nlasting effects on people\u2019s educational attainment, productivity, and social behaviors. These effects will contribute to (i) \npeople\u2019s income-earning capacity, and (ii) the reduction of health care and education expenditures.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  project  will  help  achieve  key  Millennium  Development  Goals:  reducing  child  mortality  and  achieving  and \nsustaining a 100% primary school enrolment rate. It will also help children from underserved areas. The technical \nassistance should expedite feasible and cost-effective means to target poverty. Geographical targeting was effective \nfor the Community-Based Early Childhood Development Project (CBECDP). It covered those raions (districts) where \nthe poverty rates were above 70%. If the second CBECDP includes raions where the poverty rate is less than 50%, it \nmay require other targeting mechanisms, as well.    \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?

All these agencies and people will be involved in the project design, through needs assessments and \nconsultation workshops.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  There are no tangible gender-based differences in children\u2019s access to \nchild health, nutrition, or preschool programs.
