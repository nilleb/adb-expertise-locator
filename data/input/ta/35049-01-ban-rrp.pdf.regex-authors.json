THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project. \n \n2.  The project will build the first fixed crossing across the Padma River in Bangladesh \ncomprising a two-level bridge 6.15 kilometers (km) long, 12 km of approach roads, tolling and \nservice facilities, and river training works to regulate the river flow and prevent damage to the \nbridge structure. The project will include a component to build the institutional capacity of the \nexecuting agency to ensure the sustainability of the project.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh is a riverine country, and the major rivers flowing through it are the Ganges, \nJamuna, Meghna, and Padma. Historically, this river system has split Bangladesh into (i) the \nnorthwest zone, bordered by the Ganges and Jamuna rivers; (ii) the east zone, which is east of \nthe Jamuna River, where the capital, Dhaka, and the major port, Chittagong, are situated; and \n(iii) the southwest zone, isolated by the Padma and Ganges rivers. The Padma River is formed \nby the confluence of the Ganges and the Jamuna rivers. The river, about 5 km wide with \nbraided, turbulent, and shifting flows, has been a major transport barrier between the southwest \nzone and the northwest and east zones. At present, passengers and freight are transported \nacross the river by ferry and, to a lesser extent, by launches and rowboats. Their services are \ngrossly inadequate in terms of both capacity and service level. Existing ferry services involve \nlong and unpredictable waits at terminals lacking basic amenities. Flooding, fog, and other \ndifficult weather conditions routinely cause services to be suspended or cancelled. \n \n4.   The completion of the Jamuna bridge in June 1998 improved the connectivity of the \nnorthwest  zone  to  the  economically  important  east  zone,  thus  accelerating  the  former\u2019s \nsocioeconomic development and alleviating poverty in the country as a whole.1 Similar impacts \nare expected with the opening of the proposed Padma bridge. The bridge is expected to have \nsubregional impacts by forming part of the Asian Highway Route A-1, the main Asian Highway \nroute connecting Asia to Europe.   \n \n5.  The pre-feasibility study conducted with government financing in 1999\u20132000 established \nthe  technical  and  economic  viability  of  a  bridge  across  the  Padma  River. 2   A  more \ncomprehensive  feasibility  study  undertaken  in  2001\u20132005  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) reaffirmed the technical and economic viability of building the bridge \nat the Mawa\u2013Janjira crossing.3 During the feasibility study, the government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank to extend \ntheir support for constructing the bridge through a cofinancing arrangement similar to that \nadopted for the Jamuna bridge.4 The development partners came to an understanding that (i) \nthe project is too large to be financed by a single aid agency, (ii) the exemplary development \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Jamuna Bridge Impact Study. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila (TA 3681-BAN). \n2  Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority. 2000. Padma Bridge Study: Prefeasibility Report. Dhaka.  \n3  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2005. The Feasibility Study of the Padma Bridge. Tokyo. \n4  The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project cost $753.7 million: $207.0 million from ADB, $200 million from the \nOverseas Economic Cooperation Fund (Japan), $199.1 million from the World Bank, and $147.6 million in \ngovernment counterpart funding. ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna Bridge Project. Manila (Loan \n1298-BAN). ", "2 \npartner coordination and cooperation achieved for constructing the Jamuna bridge should be \nreplicated for the Padma bridge, and (iii) subsequent project preparation would be carried out \njointly.  \n \n6.  In  2005,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)5  to complement  JICA\u2019s  feasibility \nstudy, which confirmed the technical and economic viability of the Padma bridge. The TA aimed \nas well to develop a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) for the project, which would have required \nseveral preparatory measures and conditions such as (i) creating an enabling environment for \nwhat is a new concept in Bangladesh through a comprehensive fiscal, financial, and legal policy \nframework, (ii) building capacity in the executing agency; and (iii) implementing a vast public \ncommunication  plan.  The  TA  therefore  did  not  recommend  pursuing  PPP.  However,  it  is \nenvisaged that the operation and maintenance of the bridge will involve the private sector.  \n \n7.  ADB processed a TA loan of $17.6 million in 20076 to finance (i) consultants to prepare \ndetailed  design  and  help  the  Bangladesh  Bridge  Authority  (BBA)  with  tendering,  (ii)  an \nengineering review to confirm the selected deliverables of the design consultants, and (iii) a \npanel of reputed international and national experts to provide advisory services to BBA. The \nWorld Bank is assisting, under a $3 million project preparatory facility, with (i) an independent \nreview of social and environmental safeguard documents, (ii) financial due diligence, (iii) the \nstrengthening of BBA, and (iv) additional financing for the panel of experts. \n8.  The government accords very high priority to the project, which is included in ADB's \n2010\u20132012  country  operations  business  plan  for  Bangladesh  as  a  firm  loan  for  2010 \nprocessing.7 Since mobilizing the design consultants, ADB, the Islamic Development Bank, \nJICA, and the World Bank have fielded joint missions to deal with various aspects of project \npreparation.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  project  will  significantly  improve  the  country's  surface  transport  systems  and, \nbecause of its size, lift the nation's economy. Specifically, the project will accelerate economic \ngrowth in the southwest zone of Bangladesh. The direct outcome of the project will be improved \nsurface  transport  between  Dhaka  and  the  southwest  zone.  The  project\u2019s  institutional \nstrengthening component will ensure the sustainability of the project and other BBA investment \nprojects. \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The key outputs will be (i) the first fixed crossing across the Padma River for road traffic \ncomprising  (a)  a  two-level  steel  truss  composite  bridge  6.15  km  long,  the  top  deck  to \naccommodate a four-lane highway and the lower deck to accommodate a single-track railway to \nbe added in the future; (b) 12.0 km of approach roads, 1.5 km on the Mawa side and 10.5 km on \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $2,915 million (Table 1). This estimate is based on the \nnear-final engineering design of the bridge, approach roads, river training works, and related \nfacilities  prepared  by  the  design  consultant.

For ADB loans, interest and commitment charges are included. For the ADF loan, \ninterest during construction has been calculated at 1.0% per year. For the ordinary capital resources loan, interest \nduring construction has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.3% \nand commitment charges at 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSources: Bangladesh Bridge Authority and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $539  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 27-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  7  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.9 The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n13.  The government has requested an additional loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR 48,206,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements (footnote 9).  \n                                                 \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Loan Agreements; Project Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n14.  ADB loans will be used to finance part of the cost of the civil works, financing charges \nduring the implementation of the ADB loans, and local taxes and duties estimated at $80 million \non ADB-financed expenditures. The taxes and duties are estimated to amount to 19.5% of the \ntotal project cost, which is not excessive considering the high share of imported materials for \nbridge works. The government will finance a large share of land acquisition and resettlement \ncosts in addition to its share of civil works. ADB\u2019s financing of taxes and duties will be material \nto the success of the project. No taxes or duties in Bangladesh are considered unreasonable or \ndiscriminatory. \n \n15.  Three cofinanciers will provide a total of $1,640 million through parallel cofinancing \n(Table 2). ADB assistance through the ongoing TA loan for design and other pre-construction \nactivities (footnote 6) has facilitated the partners\u2019 participation as cofinanciers in the project. \nDetails of the financing arrangements are in the project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total  \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  BBA will be the executing agency. The project implementation unit established for the \nongoing TA loan and its supplementary loan will be expanded into a project management unit \nwith sufficient staff to handle the wide range of tasks involved in project implementation. The \nproject management unit will be headed by a project director, who will be reporting to the \nexecutive director of BBA, and will be staffed with qualified engineers and experts recruited both \ninternally and externally. The panel of experts, which was established during the design phase \nand provided the project implementation unit with independent advisory support, will continue to \nprovide similar support during construction.  \n \n17.  Civil works will be carried out by international civil works contractors selected through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  supervised  by  a  firm  of  international  construction \nsupervision  consultants.  To  aid  BBA  in  its  capacity  as  the  employer  under  International \nFederation of Consulting Engineers conditions of contract and assist with managing the project \nand monitoring its impact, a firm of management support consultants will be engaged. Both \nconsultancy services will be financed using the proceeds of a loan from the World Bank. BBA\u2019s \nprocurement  capacity  has  been  assessed,  and  appropriate  risk  mitigation  measures  are \nincorporated in the design and implementation arrangements of the project.  \n \n18.  Civil works to be financed by loans from the cofinanciers have been packaged into \ncontracts for (i) the main bridge, estimated to cost $1,300 million, with ADB, JICA, and World \n ", "5 \nBank financing; (ii) river training works, estimated to cost $800 million, with ADB and World \nBank financing; (iii) approach roads and bridge-end facilities on the Mawa side, estimated to \ncost $35 million, with World Bank financing; (iv) approach roads and bridge-end facilities on the \nJanjira side, estimated to cost $160 million, with Islamic Development Bank financing; and (v) \nthe service area on the Janjira side, estimated to cost $30 million, with World Bank financing.  \n \n19.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  5 years (inclusive of pre-construction activities) \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2015 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  1) Coordination Committee chaired by Advisor to the Prime Minister on Economic \nAffairs \n2) Panel of Experts \n3) Cofinanciers Monitoring Committee (comprising the Bangladesh Bridge Authority \nand the cofinanciers)  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Bangladesh Bridge Authority \n(iii)  Project management unit  Dhaka, 118 staff \nProcurement  International competitive  5 contracts (2 contracts for ADB  $30 million\u2013 \nbidding  financing)  $1,300 million \nNational competitive bidding for multiple contracts to develop resettlement sites \nunder GOB financing \nConsulting services (to be  Quality- and cost-based  Management support and  $7 million \nfinanced by the World Bank)  selection  construction supervision consultants  $65 million \nAdvance contracting and  Works (for ADB financing) \nretroactive financing \nDisbursement    The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOB = Government of Bangladesh. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  The procurement of civil works under ADB financing will be carried out in compliance \nwith  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  with  such \nmodifications and waivers as ADB will have agreed to for this project. The prequalification of \ncontractors for the main bridge and river training works contracts is being undertaken by the \nexecuting agency. Considering the joint nature of the financing and the eligibility policies of the \nWorld  Bank  and  JICA,  the  prequalification  process  is  open  to  firms,  subcontractors,  and \nmaterials  from  any  country  eligible  under  ADB,  JICA,  or  World  Bank  financing,  and  it  is \nproposed to allow the procurement of civil works contractors, subcontractors, and materials for \nthe project also from countries that are not ADB members. For this to happen, a waiver from \nADB\u2019s country and source eligibility provision is necessary, and is being sought for this project. \nIn the absence of a waiver on country and source eligibility, implementation of the project as a \njoint project will not be possible. In addition, considering the joint nature of the financing and \nsignificant fiduciary and reputation risks involved, firms and entities sanctioned by any of the \ncofinanciers will be debarred from participating in contracts which are jointly financed by them.   \n \n21.  For effective coordination, ADB is developing, in consultation with other cofinanciers, a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic  principles  and  procedural  aspects  of \n ", "6 \ncollaboration.10 The memorandum of understanding will be signed as quickly as possible, but in \nany event, by no later than the issue of any final bidding documents in respect of any contract to \nbe cofinanced by ADB under the project. \n \nIII.   DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n \n22.  The ADB TA loan and its supplementary loan provide sufficient resources to conduct the \nnecessary surveys, tests, and studies (footnote 6). The panel of experts has met frequently to \ndiscuss design deliverables. Checking engineers are conducting further technical due diligence \nof the detailed engineering design. The detailed design has been informed by the country's past \nexperience in constructing bridges across its major rivers and other recent projects of similar \nsize  and  nature  executed  elsewhere.  Climate  change  impacts  affecting  the  water  level, \ntemperature regime, rainfall, river discharge, and wind speed have been considered in the \ndesign parameters.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n23.  Estimates of the benefits accruing to road users, using the conventional approach of \nestimating savings in vehicle operating and travel time costs, found the project economically \nviable, with an economic internal rate of return of 15%\u201320% under different benefit and cost \nassumptions.11  To  supplement  this  analysis,  a  comprehensive  impact  analysis  has  been \nconducted using social accounting matrix and computable general equilibrium models. The \nmain  results  from  the  models  indicate  that  rates  of  poverty  reduction  will  be  higher  than \nhistorical trends over the past 2 decades and yield an economic internal rate of return of 21%, in \nline with the results of the conventional approach. These models will be updated during project \nimplementation to estimate project impact and for ex-post evaluation of project impacts on the \nregion and the national economy.   \n24.  Financial analysis was carried out to identify the cash-flow requirement for sustainably \nfinancing the project. The result suggests that toll rates for the Padma bridge need to be \nsubstantially  higher  than  current  toll  rates  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge.  Considering  a  gradual \nincrease of toll rates to reach the required level, as agreed by the government, the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  7.9%  for  the  base  case  and  at  6.5%  for  a  more \nconservative traffic scenario. Although the financial internal rate of return may appear low, it \ncaptures only a minority of financial flows and benefits that the project will generate in the \nsouthwest zone. The low financial internal rate of return demonstrates the necessity of public \nintervention and the inappropriateness of a PPP approach.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  BBA  needs  to  increase  its  staff  numbers  and  enhance  its  capacity  significantly  to \nmanage the project and then properly maintain the asset created. During project preparation, \n                                                 \n10  A  memorandum  of  understanding  with  similar  scope  was  entered  into  by  ADB,  the  Overseas  Economic \nCooperation Fund of Japan, and the World Bank for implementing the Jamuna Bridge Project. \n11 Although the Padma bridge is designed to accommodate a railway in the future, and the benefits of a railway \nconnection across the river will be significant, the economic analysis does not take them into account. This is \nmainly because (i) the timing and cost of completing the railway connection across the bridge is not immediately \navailable, (ii) the increased cost of accommodating the railway is marginal, and (iii) excluding potential railway \nbenefits results in a suitably conservative estimate.   \n ", "7 \nBBA  gradually  added  senior  staff,  mostly  through  deputation  from  other  government \norganizations. With the assistance of the World Bank, BBA developed a capacity development \naction plan on the basis of which it has started recruiting staff with expertise in resettlement, \nenvironmental management, and financial management. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BBA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 8). \n \n27.  Measures to enhance governance and minimize procurement-related risks include (i) the \noversight of the project by the panel of experts and the cofinanciers monitoring committee \n(CMC), (ii) assistance from the design consultants in civil works procurement, (iii) assistance \nfrom experienced procurement consultants in consultant selection, (iv) a project website to be \nmaintained by BBA to disclose information including on procurement, and (v) a system of \nhandling complaints related to project implementation. Further, the project management unit \nshall,  within  9  months  of  project  effectiveness,  prepare  a  grievance  redress  mechanism \nacceptable to ADB. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will annually audit all project-\nrelated  accounts  and  revenues.  All  audit  reports  and  certified  financial  statements  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the close of the year under audit. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.

The  southwest  zone  has  one  of  the  highest  poverty  rates  in \nBangladesh, according to the household income and expenditure survey conducted in 2005. \nWhile 42% of the population of the whole country lived below the absolute poverty line, the \nsouthwest  zone  had  a  poverty  incidence  of  52%  in  Barishal  Division  and  46%  in  Khulna \nDivision. During construction, local unemployed people will gain employment, and increased \ncommercial activity will generate income. The country will be physically integrated through the \nfixed link, reducing economic disparity and deprivation. An estimate of multiplier effects on the \nproject investment shows the bridge increasing the gross domestic product growth rate by 1.2% \nand the regional growth rate in the southwest zone by 3.5%, generating 743,000 person-years \nof  additional  employment,  and  thereby  contributing  1.2%  of  the  total  labor  market  of \nBangladesh.  Over  the  long  term,  the  bridge\u2019s  impact  on  poverty  reduction  will  be  more \nsignificant, as the share of economic benefits generated by the bridge that will accrue to the \npoor is larger than the share of the gross domestic product that goes to the poor.12  \n \n29.  Consultation and participation. Public consultation began in the project area in 1999 \nas part of the first pre-feasibility study and continued throughout project preparation. Surveyed \nhouseholds  perceive  the  socioeconomic  benefits  of  the  project  as  (i)  improved  access  to \nsocioeconomic services, (ii) increased employment opportunities, and (iii) improved transport \nservices that will reduce poverty in the region. A public consultation and participation plan has \nbeen developed for project implementation to ensure that adequate and timely information is \nmade available to the affected people.  \n \n30.  Gender, HIV/AIDS, and public health. The participation of both women and men was \nensured during the social study by undertaking gender analysis. Focus group discussions were \nundertaken with women and men belonging to different socioeconomic groups. The project will \nphysically displace 283 households headed by women. A gender action plan and public health \naction  plan  have  been  developed  for  the  following:  (i) entitlements  for  losses  suffered  by \n                                                 \n12  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nwomen; (ii) livelihood reconstruction and income restoration programs; (iii) the employment of \nunskilled and semi-skilled laborers in civil works construction; (iv) the management of health \nand sexually transmitted infections to address public health, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking \nissues; (v) gender-equitable processes of consultation and information dissemination in relation \nto resettlement and rehabilitation; and (vi) gender-inclusive mechanisms to redress grievances. \n \n31.  Chars. Hydraulic studies suggested that constructing the bridge will have no adverse \nimpacts  on  chars 13 upstream  and  downstream  from  the  bridge.  However,  in  extensive \nconsultation with char-dwelling communities, a char monitoring and management framework \nwas developed to monitor any unanticipated impacts during and after construction and develop \nmitigation plans if impacts are confirmed. BBA is firmly committed to providing resources for \nchar monitoring, protection, and development. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified \ninvoluntary resettlement category A and indigenous peoples category C in accordance with \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  A  100%  census  based  on  the  detailed  design \nidentified 13,578 households that will suffer impacts on livelihoods and assets such as income \nfrom day labor, agricultural land, residential and commercial assets, and trees. Of this number, \n3,886 will be physically displaced and 9,692 will be economically displaced. A resettlement \nframework14 and three separate resettlement action plans15 have been prepared based on \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and other cofinanciers' safeguard polices to address all \nlosses. The complete details of compensation rates for the loss of assets, development of \nresettlement sites, shifting and transitional assistance, and other income-restoration assistance, \nincluding  additional  support  for  vulnerable  groups,  are  in  the  entitlement  matrixes  of  the \nresettlement  action  plans.  Four  resettlement  sites  are  being  developed  for  displaced \nhouseholds. BBA will provide sufficient funds for the timely implementation of resettlement and \nsocial action plans. No impact on indigenous people is envisaged.  \n \n33.  Environment. Considering that this is a large project involving significant changes in \nland use and impacts on wildlife, the project has been classified environmental category A in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  To  investigate  the  various \nenvironmental impacts in the project area, studies have included an (i) initial environmental \nexamination  of  resettlement  sites,  (ii)  environmental  impact  assessment  (including \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan [EMMP]),16 (iii) environmental quality baseline \nmonitoring survey, and (iv) ecological report. Further, climate change has been factored into the \ndesign of the project. The reports have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of \nADB,  JICA,  and  the  World  Bank.  To  ensure  proper  environmental  impact  monitoring,  the \nbaseline data provided in the environmental impact assessment report will be further verified \nand updated before the start of project implementation.  \n \n34.  The EMMP and environmental codes of practice for 19 environmental issues have been \ndeveloped  to  help  minimize  environmental  impacts.  These  cover  managing  waste  and \nhazardous materials, controlling erosion and sedimentation, and protecting fauna through such \nmeasures as timing and locating construction to avoid disturbing the migration and breeding of \n                                                 \n13 Land located in an active river basin that is subject to erosion and accretion. \n14 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Resettlement Action Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nhilsa  fish. Contractors  will  prepare  further  detailed  construction  environmental  action  plans \n(CEAPs) based on the EMMP and environmental codes of practice. The CEAPs will be contract \ndocuments used for monitoring by the construction supervision consultant and an independent \nexternal monitor. Quarterly and annual progress reports on the implementation of CEAPs will be \nsubmitted to ADB. The EMMP will be revised by the construction supervision consultant and \ncontractors to reflect any changes in project components. Adequate budget provision has been \nmade for implementing CEAPs and EMMP.  \n  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n35.
