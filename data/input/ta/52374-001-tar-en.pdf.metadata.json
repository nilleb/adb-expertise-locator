Mongolia  has  experienced  rapid  urbanization  since  its  transition  to  a  market-based \neconomy in 1991. Ulaanbaatar\u2019s population has grown from 794,730 in 2000, to 1.24 million in \n2010, reaching approximately 1.46 million in 2018. Growth has largely been a result of in-country-\nmigration from the countryside to informal settlements on the city periphery, creating vast, \nunplanned, peri-urban areas known as the ger areas, which extend around Ulaanbaatar. The ger \nareas are characterized by low-density, low- and medium-income households. Many plots cannot \nbe  reached  by  municipal  services;  most  roads  are  unpaved,  and  infrastructure  is  poor  or \nnonexistent.  These  ger  districts  are  home  to  an  estimated  850,000  people  as  of  2018, \nrepresenting about 60% of Ulaanbaatar city\u2019s population. Poverty in Ulaanbaatar is highest in the \nger areas. A citywide survey of Ulaanbaatar carried out by the World Bank in 2014 found that the \naverage household income in fringe and middle ger areas was about half that of the households \nliving outside the ger areas.1 \n \n2.  To illustrate measures to improve transport services in the ger areas, a demonstration \ncorridor has been selected in Chingeltei district. The selected corridor is Chingeltei Street which \npasses through Khoroo 17 and 18 in the ger areas. 2 The Improving Transport Services in Ger \nAreas project aims to demonstrate interventions that improve the accessibility, safety, security \nand quality of transport services along the Chilgeltei corridor in the northern  ger areas of \nUlaanbaatar city through three outputs: (i) public transport access, facilities and services improved \nin  Chingeltei  corridor;  (ii)  pedestrian  safety  facilities  and  residents\u2019  along  Chingeltei  street \nenhanced; and (iii) community-led behaviour change and community engagement enhanced. The \nproject has strong pro-poor, socially inclusive and gender-sensitive features. The project will \ndirectly benefit 23,644 persons, including 12,104 women, 7,336 children and 454 persons with \ndisabilities (PWDs) in two Khoroos (districts) in the ger areas. The project will have wider impacts \nthrough the demonstration of solutions to improve safety, accessibility and quality of public \ntransport services and improving road safety, which can be replicated in other transport corridors \nin Ulaanbaatar. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The Chingeltei transport corridor is served by two bus routes, bus route 23 operated by \nstate-owned company, Passenger Transport Consortium, and bus route 24A operated by a \nprivate  company,  Blue  bus.  The  Public  Transport  Service  Department  (PTSD)  regulates, \nmanages, and plans all public transport in Ulaanbaatar, including licensing bus companies, route \nassignment, fare-setting, monitoring, and supervising. Ulaanbaatar has a smart card, electronic \npayment system for public transport, which is managed by the Ulaanbaatar Smart Card Company \n(UBSCC). The UBSCC also manages a bus information management system and a phone \napplication for public transport users. \n \n4.  To understand the key needs and concerns of public transport users in Chingeltei, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) prepared a needs assessment with residents of the Chingeltei \ncorridor, under RETA 9475: Deepening ADB-Civil Society Engagement in Selected Countries in \nCentral and West Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific (Subproject 1). Walking and taking the bus \nwere identified as the most common means of transportation, particularly for poorer residents. \nThe transport system comprises informal taxis, private vehicles, buses and walking. \n \n \n1  2014. World Bank. Household Survey on Service Delivery in Ulaanbaatar. Washington, DC. \n2  Khoroo is the smallest administrative subdivision of Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "2 \n5.  The quality of bus services was identified as a key issue during the needs assessment. \nPublic transport users often walk long distances to get to the bus stop, and once they do, they \noften wait more than 30 minutes without shelter or seating. Bus schedules and route information \nboards are not widely available, and when they are, they are often poorly located or filled by \ncommercial advertisements, making them difficult for persons with visual disabilities to read. \nPublic transport routes are not connected to google maps or other commonly used mapping \nplatforms. There is a special Ulaanbaatar public transport phone application, but it is not user \nfriendly and it does not have an offline mode, requiring public transport users to use mobile data \nand have reliable 4G signal to be able to access the routes and schedules. Further, the application \nfor PWDs often does not work and was identified by PWDs as difficult to use. \n \n6.  In addition, bus services were associated with unsafe driver behavior and poor customer \nservice, including not stopping at designated stops, violating traffic rules and unsafe driving.3 Even \nwhere curbs or structure have been built to aid accessibility, bus drivers often don\u2019t stop at the \ncurb rendering the accessibility features useless. Informal taxis and private vehicles often park at \nthe curbs near bus stops preventing buses from docking at the curb. For PWDs, a lack of \nassistance in boarding/disembarking and refusal of service were also noted as key issues relating \nto bus services in the project area. \n \n7.  The PTSD currently enters into 1-year service agreement contracts with bus companies \nbut are working on developing 3-year contracts which will include more stringent rules and service \nrequirements for bus operating companies. There is currently no systematic vetting procedure for \nbus drivers and no effective mechanisms to identify and address driver behavior issues. \n \n8.  During  the  needs  assessment,  the  residents  noted  that  the  provision  of  real  time \ninformation, either via smart information boards or an improved phone application, would be \nbeneficial to residents to see when the arrival of the next bus is expected. This would help to \nminimize the time passengers are waiting at bus stops exposed to the elements which would be \nparticularly beneficial in winter where average minimum temperatures reach -29 degrees Celsius. \nPWDs also noted that inclusion of a sign of a wheelchair to note routes and times which have \naccessible buses would enable them to more reliably plan their trips. \n \n9.  There are three digital information boards in operation in downtown Ulaanbaatar; however, \nthe boards do not have real-time bus location or predictive elements to show when the bus will \narrive at the stop. Although buses in Ulaanbaatar are equipped with GPS to locate buses, \nUlaanbaatar does not have reliable traffic data. The use of google maps by individual vehicles in \nUlaanbaatar is not common enough to provide reliable traffic information. Therefore, a dedicated \ntraffic monitoring system would be required to enable Ulaanbaatar to collect traffic information \nand utilize it for route planning and for real-time public transport information services. The Korea \nTransport Institute (KOTI) identified needs and priorities to improve traffic and bus information \nsystems  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  9131:  Intelligent  Transport  Systems  (ITS) \nDevelopment for Mongolia. This TA would build on these findings and work with the UBSCC to \nidentify, develop and pilot an appropriate real-time bus information system in the project area. \n \n10.  This TA will build the capacity of the GOCC, PTSD, bus companies and UBSCC to \nimprove the accessibility and quality of public transport services in the Chingeltei corridor. It will \nengage civil society and the community to encourage necessary behavior change to improve the \noverall project outcomes. This will be done through software development, capacity building and \ncommunity engagement as discussed below. \n \n3  PTSD has a hotline for public transportation. By November 2018, 3,382 complaints had been received, including \nmisconduct (e.g., smoking/talking on the phone while driving), violation of traffic rules (e.g., speeding), and not \nstopping at designated bus stops amongst others. \n ", "3 \n \n11.  The impact will be access to safe and comfortable transport services that meet customers\u2019 \ndemand  improved.4 The  outcome  will  be  improved  access  to  public  transport  services  for \nresidents, particularly vulnerable groups, in ger areas demonstrated.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n12.  Output  1:  Predictive bus  information  service  and  effective  customer  feedback \nmechanism developed. This output will assist the GOCC and PTSD in improving the quality and \naccessibility of public transport services in the project corridor and in Ulaanbaatar through: \n(i) developing  and  implementing  software  which  tracks  live  traffic  and  predicts  traffic  in \nUlaanbaatar city, and  connecting this traffic data to the existing bus information management \nsystem operated and managed by the UBSCC; (ii) improving the public transportation application \nfor the public, through inclusion of offline mode access, the inclusion of live traffic information and \nimproving the function of the accessible version of the application for PWDs; (iii) improving the \neffectiveness of the customer-feedback mechanism, including testing of the hotline effectiveness \nand piloting other types of feedback mechanisms; and (iv) monitor, evaluate and document \nlessons learned from the pilot of a dedicated accessible bus service along the project corridor and \nthe pilot of speakers on buses to announce arrival of bus routes.5 \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity of the executing agency and bus companies improved. This \noutput will improve the capacity of the GOCC, PTSD and bus companies operating in the project \ncorridor, particularly related to customer service and effective public transport operations, through \n(i) training for PTSD hotline officers to ensure complaints received are acted upon effectively;6 \n(ii) train-the-trainer program for bus driver training, particularly on appropriate driver etiquette and \nproper use of bus stops and accessibility features; (iii) training for bus companies and bus drivers \nto improve customer service, particularly related to harassment; (iv) exploration of practical \noptions to incentivize bus companies and drivers to improve service standards; (v) training for \nPTSD  and  bus  companies  to  increase  awareness  of  operational  sustainability  (including \nmaintenance) and (vi) recommendations for driver service standards, route planning, effective \ncomplaints mechanisms and appropriate regulatory frameworks based on the findings of the pilot. \n \n14.  Output 3: Behavior change and community engagement supported. This output will \nengage consultants and civil society organizations to maximize the engagement of the community \nin  improving  transport  services  in  the  project  corridor.  It  will  include  (i)  developing  and \nimplementing a capacity building program on human-centered design for key stakeholders; \n(ii) developing a methodology to identify and select community-designed and led initiatives to \nimprove public transportation behavior, reduce harassment in public transportation and improve \ncommunity ownership over the project corridor; (iii) project management of all community-led \ninitiatives under the project; and (iv) designing and implementing behavior change communication \ninitiatives,  including  promoting  bus  etiquette  among  drivers  and  passengers  and  engaging \ninformal taxi drivers and associations to promote a proper etiquette for informal taxi drivers.

Mongolia  has  experienced  rapid  urbanization  since  its  transition  to  a  market-based \neconomy in 1991. Ulaanbaatar\u2019s population has grown from 794,730 in 2000, to 1.24 million in \n2010, reaching approximately 1.46 million in 2018. Growth has largely been a result of in-country-\nmigration from the countryside to informal settlements on the city periphery, creating vast, \nunplanned, peri-urban areas known as the ger areas, which extend around Ulaanbaatar. These \nger districts are home to an estimated 850,000 people as of 2018, representing about 60% of \nUlaanbaatar city\u2019s population. Poverty in Ulaanbaatar is highest in the ger areas. A citywide \nsurvey of Ulaanbaatar carried out by the World Bank in 2014 found that the average household \nincome in fringe and middle ger areas was about half that of the households living outside the ger \nareas.1 \n \n2.  The ger areas are characterized by low-density, low- and medium-income households. \nMany plots cannot be reached by municipal services; most roads are unpaved, and infrastructure \nis poor or nonexistent. Even where there are paved roads in the ger districts, road safety elements \nsuch as signs, signals, speed bumps, pedestrian crossings, and footpaths are rarely provided. \nThe lack of basic infrastructure severely limits access to transportation, clean water, health, and \neducation services, exacerbating the effects of poverty and inequality.2 \n \n3.  The transport system in ger areas includes bus, micro-bus, taxi, informal taxi, private \nvehicles, and walking. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) prepared a needs assessment under \nRETA 9475: Deepening ADB-Civil Society Engagement in Selected Countries in Central and \nWest Asia, East Asia, and the Pacific (Subproject 1). Civil society organizations (CSOs), were \nengaged  to  conduct  interviews,  observation  and  focus  groups  in  ger  areas  to  ensure  the \ncommunity needs and views were integrated into project design. Walking and taking the bus were \nidentified as the most common means of transportation, particularly for poorer residents. \n \n4.  The needs assessment revealed that both male and female commuters experience \nharassment from drunk persons at bus stops and in the streets and feel unsafe walking the narrow, \ndark streets to access the bus stops. Female commuters also noted sexual harassment both on \nthe  bus  and  walking  to  access the  bus  stops.  Further, the  needs  assessment  highlighted \naccessibility issues for persons with substantial mobility problems, the deaf and the blind, \nincluding inaccessible infrastructure and signage, a lack of assistance in boarding/disembarking \nand even refusal of service. These challenges result in many persons with disabilities choosing \nto stay home. Poor driver behavior and customer service, including not stopping at designated \nstops, violating traffic rules and unsafe driving were also mentioned.3 \n \n5.  The  city  has  950  buses  of  which  937  run  per  day,  providing  approximately \n740,000 passenger trips per day.4 There are 21 bus operating companies that operate on 75 main \nroutes in Ulaanbaatar, out of which one is state-owned and all others are private companies. The \n                                                \n1  2014. World Bank. Household Survey on Service Delivery in Ulaanbaatar. Washington, DC. \n2  As of 2014, the World Bank estimated the Gini coefficient for Ulaanbaatar as 0.45 using the National Statistical \nOffice\u2019s socioeconomic household survey data. \n3  The  Transport  Department of  the  Capital  City  has  a hotline  for  public  transportation.  By  November  2018, \n3,382 complaints had been received, including misconduct (e.g., smoking/talking on the phone while driving), \nviolation of traffic rules (e.g., speeding), and not stopping at designated bus stops among others. \n4  2018. Ulaanbaatar Smart Card Company (UBSCC) data. Ulaanbaatar.  \n \n ", "2 \nTransport Department of the Capital City (TDCC) regulates, manages, and plans public transport, \nincluding licensing bus companies, route assignment, fare-setting, monitoring, and supervising. \n \n6.  Residents often walk long distances without footpaths or lighting to take the bus.5 Once \nthey get to the bus stop, they often wait more than 30 minutes without shelter or seating. Bus \nschedules and route information boards are not widely available, and when they are, they are \noften poorly located or filled by commercial advertisements, making them difficult for persons with \nvisual disabilities to read. There is a phone application for routes but it often does not work and is \nnot user friendly. Safety and accessibility of bus stops, particularly the terminus, are also major \nchallenges. Safety is reduced by a lack of footpaths, lighting, pedestrian crossings and signage. \nAccessibility is reduced by a lack of ramps and features for persons with disabilities. Informal taxis \nand private vehicles also park at curbs near bus stops, preventing buses from docking at the curb, \nfurther reducing accessibility. Although accessibility is low, a higher proportion of elderly and \ndisabled passengers take public transport in ger areas than other parts of the city.6  \n \n7.  This project is aligned to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities \nand  making  cities  more  livable.7 It  is  also  closely  aligned  to  the  Mongolian  Government \nSustainable  Development  Vision  2030  which  seeks  to  expand  and  develop  all  types  of \neconomically  efficient,  safe,  and  comfortable  transportation  services  that  meet  customers\u2019 \ndemand.8 \n \nB.  Proposed Solutions \n \n8.  There are several ongoing interventions in Ulaanbaatar which address some underlying \ntransport challenges. ADB\u2019s MFF 0078: Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development \nInvestment Program is a large-scale intervention in the ger areas to improve access to services \nand facilities and includes paving some roads and footpaths in ger areas. ADB\u2019s MFF 0070 is an \nongoing Urban Transport Development Investment Program which aims to develop a bus rapid \ntransit system in Ulaanbaatar center and improve public transport management. Other projects \ninclude  ADB  Japan  Fund for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR) Grant  9198:  Combating  Domestic \nViolence Against Women and Children, and Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s ongoing \nproject: Promoting Social Participation of Persons with Disabilities in Ulaanbaatar (2016\u20132020). \nThis would complement these projects by piloting specific measures to improve accessibility, \nsafety and security of public transport for vulnerable users in the ger areas.9  \n \n9.  The pilot project area will be selected in line with the Ulaanbaatar City Masterplan, in an \narea with high concentration of poor and vulnerable users and visibility. The pilot will be designed \nto be replicable in other precincts by the government. A human-centered design approach \ninvolving active participation of users will be taken to project design and implementation.10 \n                                                \n5  In 2016, reported road crashes were the fifth leading cause of deaths in Mongolia, with approximately 597 fatalities \nannually, 31% of which were pedestrians. According to the Ulaanbaatar City Traffic Police, children get into more \naccidents in ger areas than in the city center. \n6  Data from the UBSCC shows that most public transport users come from the ger areas, and that the proportion of \nelderly and disabled passengers on public transport is higher in ger areas. \n7  2018.

Output 1: Pilot safe bus-stop and pedestrian precinct constructed. A secure bus stop \nand pedestrian precinct designed on the principles of accessible design11 and considering \nprinciples of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design12 will be piloted. This will involve \n(i) the design and construction of a safe, weather protected, accessible terminus bus stop; (ii) the \nprovision  of  accessible  pedestrian  infrastructure  including  footpaths  and  zebra  crossings, \nconsidering elderly, women, children, and disability friendly design; (iii) design and construction \nof accessible bus shelters along the pilot project corridor; (iv) design and implementation of road-\nsafety measures in the project area such as signage, speed bumps, and others; (v) design and \nimplementation of appropriate parking management systems or structures as required around the \nterminus; and (vi) design and installation of innovative technology to improve safety, reliability, \naccessibility,  and  quality  of  public  transport  services  such  as  accessible  real-time  digital \ninformation  boards13 and  speakers,  smart  pedestrian  crossing  technology,  real  time  user \nfeedback system, and security equipment such as closed-circuit television (CCTV). Design under \nthis output must consider life-cycle cost impacts to ensure sustainability of project outcomes. \n \n11.  Output 2: Safety and quality of bus services improved. This output will include \ncapacity strengthening for bus companies and bus drivers: (i) improving the annual bus driver \ntraining to include station approach and departure, assistance for elderly and persons with \ndisabilities, and customer service training; (ii) recommendations for bus companies, including \ndriver incentive schemes; (iii) public campaign on road safety near public transportation and \nappropriate  passenger  behavior;  and  (iv)  implementation  of  a  customer  service  feedback \nmechanism. \n \n12.  Output 3: Institutional capacity strengthened. This output will involve institutional \nstrengthening, including (i) support and recommendations to the TDCC such as standards, bus \nroute planning, sustainable business models (including maintenance), appropriate regulatory \nframeworks and training and reporting related to safety in public transport;14 and (ii) institutional \nsupport to the Traffic Police and Law Enforcement University to improve training and enforcement \noutcomes related to the project outputs, such as illegal parking, road traffic rules, and improved \npolice patrols around public transport services. These outputs will result in the following outcome: \naccess to public transport services for residents, particularly vulnerable groups, in ger areas \nimproved. The project will be aligned with the following impact: economically efficient, safe, and \ncomfortable transport services that meet customers\u2019 demand developed.15 \n \nC.  Proposed Financing Plans and Modality \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $2.02 million as shown in Table 1. JFPR would provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $2.0 million to be administered by ADB.16 The grant will finance \nminor civil works, equipment, consulting services, capacity building, incidental expenditures, and \ncontingencies.17 The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n                                                \n11 Accessible design is a design process in which the needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered. \n12 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is an approach to deter criminal behavior through the \ndesign of the urban environment and use of technology, and has gained wide international acceptance, championed \nby law enforcement agencies. \n13 These information boards should provide real-time information on the location and estimated arrival time of a bus, \nas well as how full the bus is. This can utilize the bus information system and data from USCC. \n14 Hotlines, improved reporting, and availability of trained staff have proven to be effective in addressing sexual \nharassment, verbal and physical abuse in public transport, especially for women and children. \n15 2016.

PROJECT PREPARATION AND READINESS \n \n15.  Seed money for the preparation of JFPR grant proposals will engage environmental, social, \nand engineering consultants to conduct safeguards and technical due diligence.18 \n \nIII.  DELIBERATIVE AND DECISION-MAKING ITEMS \n \nA.  Risk Categorization \n \n16.  Following the ADB staff instruction on business processes for sovereign operations, the \nproject is categorized as low risk. The project has been classified as category B for environment, \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement,19 category C for indigenous peoples, and category B for \nprocurement (Appendix 2) as no special or particularly large contract packages are expected. \nADB and the executing and implementing agencies have a strong track record implementing \nactivities of a similar nature and scale in Mongolia. The design, processing, and administrative \naspects of the project are non-complex. \n \nB.  Project Procurement Classification \n \n17.  Following the ADB staff instruction on business processes for sovereign operations, the \nrecommended project procurement classification is B (Appendix 2). Procurement (including \nconsulting services) to be financed by ADB-administered trust fund will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Advance contracting is not anticipated. Grant proceeds \n                                                \n18 Seed money application is subject to the approval of Government of Japan. \n19 The project will be designed to avoid land acquisition and resettlement. There may be some temporary disruption to \nbusinesses and relocation of seasonal vendors, hence, \u201cB\u201d categorization for involuntary resettlement. \n ", "5 \nwill be disbursed in line with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nC.

POVERTY IMPACT AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe latest published Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was in 2003. However, in 2016, the Government adopted \nthe Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (SDV), in which, \u201cby 2030, Mongolia aspires to be amongst \nleading middle-income countries based on per capita income.\u201d The SDV seeks to end poverty in all its forms, reduce \nincome inequality, and have 80% of the population in the middle and upper-middle income classes by 2030. \n \nThe SDV includes transport-related strategies for achieving sustainable economic development and reducing \npoverty, in particular, objectives 4 and 6 for the energy and infrastructure sector: (i) expand and develop all types of \neconomically efficient, safe, and comfortable transportation services that meet customers\u2019 demand; and (ii) provide \ngreater  independence  to  urban  areas  and  settlements,  build  roads  and  transportation,  and  engineering \ninfrastructure, create a healthy, safe and comfortable living environment for citizens, and improve urban planning in \nline with world-class green development model.a \n \nImproving transport services in ger areas will contribute to achieving these objectives through improving the quality \nof the public transport infrastructure and system which will provide increased access to safe, reliable, sustainable \ntransport services to residents of the ger areas, improving the mobility of residents and the livability of the area. In \naddition, the project will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive growth by improving the accessibility of public \ntransport services, encompassing gender-sensitive design, improving walkability of the area, reducing pedestrian \ntraffic incidents and improving safety of the area. \n \nThe project directly supports government efforts under Mongolia\u2019s SDV and is linked to Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) Strategy 2030, particularly to operational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, and (ii) making cities more livable.b It also supports pillar 2 of the Mongolia Country Partnership Strategy \nwhich focuses on infrastructure to support economic diversification. \nB.  Poverty Targeting \nGeneral intervention  Individual or household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \nThe project areas are focused on urban ger areas where the majority of poor in Ulaanbaatar are located. The final \nselection of the project area will be based on the area which will have the greatest impact and benefit to the poorest \nand most vulnerable groups in the ger areas. \n \nThe project will improve access to basic services and employment opportunities, as well as improving safety and \nsecurity for residents of the ger areas. Anticipated design features include (i) new and upgraded public transport \ninfrastructure; (ii) training and awareness campaigns for public transport officers and passengers; (iii) improved \nsafety and accessibility of public transport infrastructure; (iv) investment in improved sidewalks, pedestrian \ncrossings, street lighting and closed-circuit television (CCTV); and (v) community participation in design and options \nassessment. Improving the accessibility, safety, and security of the area will have flow on effects of creating an area \nthat is more attractive to businesses and investment, increasing opportunities for local residents and contributing to \neconomic growth in the local area and in Ulaanbaatar. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social Analysis \n1. Key issues and potential beneficiaries. \nThe expected primary beneficiaries of the project are the residents of the northern ger areas, particularly those who \nrely on public transport services. Other beneficiaries include public and private service providers, small businesses \nin the area, local government and the Ulaanbaatar municipal government. The average  income of residents  in the  \nmid-tier gers is between $136 and $161 per month (between $4.39/day and $5.19/day).c An estimated 45% of ger \narea residents have incomes below the poverty line.d \n \nThe project targets all residents and particularly low-income groups who are the main users of public transport and \nsuffer most from the inefficiencies of the transport system. The project will focus on improving access to public \ntransport services by improving safety and security, quality of service and the accessibility of infrastructure design. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n2. Impact channels and expected systemic changes. \nThe main constraints to accessing the proposed benefits will be driver behavior towards persons with disabilities, \nelderly or other needs, and the prioritization of investments. The project will address prioritization of investments by \nimplementing a human-centered design approach, including community participation mechanisms throughout the \ndesign and implementation of the project. To improve access to services and employment opportunities, better \nquality public transport services will be provider through safer, more comfortable bus stops. Crime around bus stops \nwill be reduced through the provision of lighting and CCTV and traffic accidents will be reduced through safer \npedestrian crossings and sidewalks. Driver behavior, related to safety (e.g., use of phone while driving, smoking \nwhile driving) and improved customer service to elderly or persons with disabilities will be improved through specific \ntraining and appropriate key-performance indicators for drivers to ensure equality of public transport service \nprovision. \n \n3. Focus of (and resources allocated in) the transaction TA or due diligence. \nSafety and security around bus stops, particularly for women and children, need to be carefully reviewed during \nproject due diligence. This will include investigation of specific measures to reduce incidents of harassment at or \nnear to bus stops or on public transport services, such as women and children only areas or services. \n \n4. Specific analysis for policy-based lending. Not applicable. \nII.  GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram? \n \nThe project will ensure equal access to efficient and affordable urban transport services considering the needs of \nboth male and female users of public transport. \nWomen are highly dependent on the public transport system in Mongolia and make up a large proportion of \npedestrian traffic. Personal safety and the avoidance of harassment are major concerns for female public transit \nusers. Women  are  especially  vulnerable  to  attacks  or  sexual  abuse  when  transporting  heavy  goods  and \naccompanying children, and this can be a major deterrent for women to use public transportation. Project design \nfeatures such as lighting, secure bus stops, pedestrian infrastructure, and CCTV will help to improve women\u2019s \naccess,  mobility,  and  safety.  During  the  project  preparation  phase,  the  project  will  also  investigate  the \nappropriateness of other gender-sensitivity measures such as the provision of women and children only waiting \nareas. \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to contribute to the promotion of gender equity and/or \nempowerment of women by providing women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?   Yes   No \n \nGender analysis will be conducted as part of social assessment and gender actions will be incorporated in the design \nand implementation of the proposed project components. Further, in taking a human-centered design approach to \nproject development, the user experience of women in the ger areas and their participation will be considered in \nproject design, prioritization, and options assessment. This will identify specific measures and components for \naddressing gender concerns through the project and a gender action plan will be created. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n Yes   No \n \nAll beneficiaries will benefit from improved safety and mobility, improving access to services without widening gender \ninequality. \n \n4. Indicate the intended gender mainstreaming category: \n  GEN (gender equity)    EGM (effective gender mainstreaming) \n  SGE (some gender elements)    NGE (no gender elements) \n \nIII.  PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \n1. Who are the main stakeholders of the project, including beneficiaries and negatively affected people? Identify \nhow they will participate in the project design. \n \nPotential initial stakeholders include ger area residents, users of public transport, including the urban low-, mid-\nincome population groups and persons with disabilities, public transport bus service providers, private minibus \nservice providers, Ulaanbaatar Smart Card Company (USCC), informal and formal taxi drivers, residents using \nprivate vehicles, shops nearby to bus stations, local government, Governor\u2019s Office of the Capital City and Ministry \nof  Road  and  Transport  Development  (MRTD),  and  Road  Development  Department  and  Public  Transport \nDepartment of the Capital City. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n2. How can the project contribute (in a systemic way) to engaging and empowering stakeholders and beneficiaries, \nparticularly, the poor, vulnerable, and excluded groups? What issues in the project design require participation of \nthe poor and excluded? \n \nThe project intends to take a human-centered approach to designing and prioritizing the infrastructure improvement \ncomponents of the project. This will include design consultations with key stakeholders and users during project \ndesign to identify opportunities or key needs that may influence the project design. Interviews and focus groups will \nalso be undertaken to develop the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (SPRSS) and the Gender \nAction Plan. A detailed participation plan and stakeholder communication strategy will be developed during project \npreparation. \n \n3. What are the key, active, and relevant civil society organizations (CSOs) in the project area? What is the level of \ncivil society organization participation in the project design?  \n M  Information generation and sharing   H  Consultation         H Collaboration         L Partnership \n \nCSOs Ger Community Mapping Center and Independent Living Center have experience in community involvement \nin improving ger area services, community participation in decision-making, accessibility and quality of urban \ntransport and infrastructure for the persons with disabilities. These CSOs led the needs assessment for the project. \nOther CSOs who are active in the sector include Association of Auto-road Safety, Transport Users Association, \nUniversity of Science and Technology, School of Mechanical Transport, network of child-focused CSOs, Elders\u2019 \nAssociation, national network of women\u2019s CSOs (MONFEMNET), Federation of Disabled People\u2019s Organizations. \nThe representatives of these CSOs participated in the Stakeholder Workshop held on 26 September 2018. CSOs \nwill continue to participate and be engaged in the next phases of project preparation and project implementation. It \nis envisaged that CSOs will play a particularly active role in engaging with and representing persons with disabilities \nthroughout the design phase of the project. \n \n4. Are there issues during project design for which participation of the poor and excluded is important? What are \nthey and how should they be addressed?    Yes          No     \n \nThe design of ramps, speakers, and other features intended to improve accessibility should be done so with the \nparticipation of the intended beneficiaries\u2014the elderly, women, and persons with disabilities to ensure features are \nuseful, useable, and provide the intended benefits. Further, features to improve safety and security should be \nassessed and co-designed with members of the community to improve community ownership and pride, creating a \nmore livable space and thereby reducing the likelihood of crime or vandalism in the area. A CSO with experience in \nconducting stakeholder needs assessment, participatory research, and participatory design approaches will be \nengaged during project preparation, as well as throughout implementation to ensure key project components are \nco-designed with users to maximize their intended benefit to users, particularly those aspects intended to benefit \nvulnerable groups such as women, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. \n \nIV.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \nA. Involuntary Resettlement Category   A     B     C     FI \n1. Does the project have the potential to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic \ndisplacement?    Yes          No    \n \nThe project will be designed to avoid land acquisition and resettlement, however, there may be some temporary \ndisruption to businesses and relocation of seasonal vendors. The project will involve upgrading of bus stop and \npedestrian infrastructure already owned by the municipal government. Some temporary disruption to services or \naccess is expected. Detailed assessment will be conducted during project preparation. \n2.

Does it affect the territories or natural and cultural resources indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim, as \ntheir ancestral domain?     Yes          No     \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nThe components are all focused on mid-ger urban areas of Ulaanbaatar. These areas have been in existence for \nsome time and are very heterogeneous in terms of resident\u2019s socioeconomic status. The project investments will \nbenefit all residents. No specific communities of indigenous peoples or groups have been identified in the preliminary \nscoping. This will be verified during the project preparation due diligence. \n \n3. Will the project require broad community support of affected indigenous communities?    Yes      No    \nn/a  \n \n4. What action plan is required to address risks to indigenous peoples as part of the transaction TA or due diligence \nprocess? \n Indigenous peoples plan     Indigenous peoples planning framework    Social impact matrix \n Environmental and social management system arrangement    None \nV.  OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES AND RISKS \n1.
