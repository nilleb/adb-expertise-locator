INTRODUCTION\n1. This technical assistance (TA) is to foster more effective infrastructure development in the\nCentral  and  West  Asia  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  by  improving  their  social\nsafeguards, and in particular their land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) performance. This will\nbe  accomplished  by  (i)  engaging  and  deploying  international  and  national  consultants  to\nstrengthen the processing and implementation of projects with respect to safeguard compliance;\n(ii)utilizing and building on knowledge products and relationships developed under TA 7433-REG:\nMainstreaming Land Acquisition and Resettlement in the Central and West Asia Region1 to further\npromote country ownership of sound and efficient safeguard practices in projects financed by\nAsian Development Bank (ADB); (iii) identifying gaps between local practice and ADB policy in a\ntimely manner, and developing a strategy to effectively bridge these gaps, project by project; and\n(iv) providing capacity building, primarily in the form of on-the-job training, to increase the\nunderstanding of governments of the application of environmental and social safeguards. The TA\nis consistent with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),  the 2014 and 2016 evaluation\nstudies of the Independent Evaluation Department,2 and supports Strategy 2020.3\n2. The TA will build on the achievements of TA 7433. Discussions with ADB staff and\nexecuting agencies during project missions confirm the relevance of TA 7433 and the need for\nthe extension of its most useful component\u2014support for processing and implementation through\non-the-job training. The design and monitoring framework for the new TA project is in Appendix\n1.\n3. The new TA project will aid DMCs in Central and West Asia in meeting their Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, and it is on the priority list for Central and West Asia Department (CWRD)\nfor processing in 2018.4\nII. ISSUES\n4. LAR is often an important element in infrastructure development, and it is also a frequent\ncause of development partner\u2013client disagreements, delays, and stakeholder complaints. This is\nespecially the case in Central and West Asia, where the number of infrastructure projects with\nintensive LAR has constantly increased while LAR capacity remains weak. Most DMCs in the\nregion are unfamiliar with ADB policy. They lack the institutional, administrative, or technical tools\nto execute LAR effectively based on sound international standards. Maximizing the benefits of\nnew infrastructure financed by ADB in the region requires streamlining local LAR practices to\nbetter fit the requirements of ADB\u2019s project cycle. This requires resources and dedicated efforts.\n5. Many DMCs have laws that do not directly support the compensation or rehabilitation\nstandards of ADB policy. This slows loan processing and impairs negotiations. Moreover, even if\nagreements  are  clear  in  loan  covenants, they  do  not guarantee  that  LAR  is  implemented\naccording to ADB standards. Local governments, which usually are responsible for LAR, do not\nsign loan agreements and lack understanding of ADB\u2019s policy, so they are unable to implement it\n1 ADB. 2009.

", "2 \nor are afraid they will break the law if they do so. Establishing strong country systems and country \nownership of improved LAR dynamics requires gradual change. \n6. Another source of poor LAR practice is the inadequacy of technical tools or know-how.\nLAR preparation is slowed by inaccurate maps, corrections to badly executed surveys, or weak\npublic participation skills. The lack of sound asset valuation methods may limit compensation\noptions and cause lengthy discussions or complaints before a resettlement plan is acceptable.\nPoor conceptualization of a resettlement plan may require repeated resubmissions, delaying\nproject or contract approval. These difficulties can be addressed by identifying and applying\ninnovative approaches and by providing technical training, both formal and informal. These efforts\nneed to be supported by sustained coaching in actual project work, in order to be most instructive\nand effective.\n7. Safeguards are a common source of reputational risks. Complaints from affected people\noften claim weak consultation and information disclosure, inadequacy of compensation rates or\ndelivery, and divergence between LAR implementation and resettlement plan stipulations. Some\ncomplaints may be unjustified, some are easily solved, while others can be highly problematic. If\nimproperly managed, complaints of all types can potentially bring a project to a standstill.\nRegardless of their gravity, complaints always complicate and slow project implementation, cause\ncosts, and erode citizen confidence in institutions. Grievances in projects of ADB\u2019s Central and\nWest Asia Department (CWRD) have increased significantly since 2013, when CWRD\u2019s project\ncomplaints tracking system logged 7 grievances\u2014that number rose to 17 in 2014, 28 in 2016,\nand 40 in 2016, before moderating to 23 in 2017. In 2016 and 2017, 11 complaints were elevated\nto  the  Accountability  Mechanism5.  To  reverse  this  trend,  project-based  grievance  redress\nmechanisms must be more effectively implemented and managed. Implementing agencies must\nfully consult with the affected people, properly disclose project documents, and be proactive in\ndetecting  and  correcting  mistakes.  Implementing  agencies  need  to  be  properly  trained  in\ngrievance handling, public participation, and public relations.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n8. The existing TA 7433, which will close on 31 August 2018, is working well and provides a\nvaluable  service  to  DMCs  during  the  processing  and  implementation  phases  of  projects.\nDiscussions with ADB staff, executing agencies, and implementing agencies revealed a need for\nthe extension of its most useful components, which are considered to be\n(i) continued deployment of consultants based in DMC resident missions to aid\nexecuting and implementing agencies in project processing and implementation\nas well as continued capacity building, training, and workshops where necessary;\nand\n(ii) provision of technical assistance for problem solving during project processing or\nimplementation.\n5  ADB's Accountability Mechanism provides a forum where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects can \nvoice and seek solutions to their problems and report alleged noncompliance with ADB's operational policies and \nprocedures. It consists of two separate but complementary functions: problem-solving function and compliance \nreview function. ", "3 \n9. The new TA will result in the following outcome: quality of social safeguards documents\nand social safeguards implementation improved in the CWRD portfolio. It will be aligned with the\nfollowing impact: effective infrastructure development compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy\nStatement promoted in Central and West Asia.\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n10. Output 1: Quality and timeliness of LAR instruments improved. TA consultants will\nsupport  DMC  executing  and  implementing  agencies  during  project  processing6  and\nimplementation, providing on-the-job training and advice on how to improve LAR scoping; prepare\nand implement LAR plans; and carry out monitoring and compliance reporting. This will improve\nthe quality of LAR instruments7 and reduce the number of reviews and the time required for\napproval. A technical capacity building program will provide executing and implementing agencies\nwith greater skills for proper resettlement planning and faster implementation of surveys and asset\nvaluation.  Mechanisms  for  stakeholder  consultation  and  complaints  handling  will  be\nmainstreamed.\n11. Output  2:  Country-specific  social  safeguard  administration  and  procedures\nimproved. Country assessment reports and guidance notes for LAR, prepared under TA 7433,\nwill be reviewed, expanded, and used as a basis to develop strategies for the streamlining of\nsafeguards mechanisms (procedures, implementing plans, interagency coordination).\n12. Output 3: Project-specific grievance redress mechanisms improved. DMC executing\nand  implementing  agencies  will  be  supported  by  TA  consultants,  who  will  conduct  a\ncomprehensive review of grievance redress mechanisms, including structure and composition of\nthe committee overseeing such mechanisms, and of executing and implementing agency staff\nassigned; procedures for capturing, handling, and resolving grievances; and timeframes for each\nstage of the grievance cycle. CWRD and selected DMC executing and implementing agencies\nwill agree on measures to strengthen the efficient functioning of grievance redress mechanisms;\nand develop formal, detailed and time-bound procedures for the grievance redress cycle, which\ncan be replicated and applied to other projects under the same DMC executing and implementing\nagencies.\nC. Cost and Financing\n13. The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed\nin Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. ADB will administer the TA. The Portfolio, Results, Safeguards, and Gender Unit in ADB\u2019s\nCWRD  will  implement  the  TA,  in  coordination  with  CWRD\u2019s  resident  missions  and  sector\ndivisions. It will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The resident missions will provide\ncountry support to TA activities, including provision of work space for consultants and assistance\nin planning meetings, workshops, and training.\n6   Where transaction TA safeguard consultants are either not engaged or where additional support is required.  \n7   These  instruments  typically  include  LAR  plans,  LAR  frameworks,  compliance  reports,  socioeconomic  and \nresettlement surveys, detailed measurement surveys, and valuations. ", "4 \n15. The TA will be implemented in three phases, considering the budget constraints and better\nmatching between TA fund availability and implementation. The first phase will start in July 2018\nand close in February 2020, with a budget of $750,000. CWRD may increase the TA amount in\n2020 subject to funds\u2019 availability.\n16.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following its Procurement Policy\n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or\nstaff instructions. Field activities will be carried out using a mix of international and national\nconsultants; their selection is subject to criteria such as (i) existing country portfolios, (ii) upcoming\ncountry project pipeline, and (iii) availability of qualified consultants with the requisite in-country\nexperience. The consultants will be based at resident missions, and national consultants may be\nrequired to operate in more than one DMC as needed.8\n18. An allowance was also made for the intermittent engagement of experienced and senior\ninternational  experts  as  required,  for  a  total  of  5  months.  This  may  include  resettlement\nspecialists, valuators, and other specialist disciplines. Terms of reference will be developed to\naddress specific needs as they are identified. All TA-financed consulting services shall be\nprocured in accordance with ADB Procurement Policy and the associated project administration\ninstructions and technical assistance and/or staff Instructions.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for\nSupporting Social Safeguards in the Central and West Asia Region, and hereby reports this action\nto the Board.\n8 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).
