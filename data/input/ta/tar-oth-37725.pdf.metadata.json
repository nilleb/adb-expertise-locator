The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) was organized in 1992 to facilitate sustainable \neconomic  growth  and  to  improve  the  living  standards  of  its  people.  The  GMS  includes \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan \nProvince  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  Also  in  1992,  the  GMS  countries  made  a \ncommitment,  through  Agenda  21,  to  pursue  an  integrated  policy  to  achieve  sustainable \ndevelopment objectives, i.e., mutually reinforcing economic development, social equity, and \nenvironmental conservation. Chapter 8 of Agenda 211 called upon countries to develop national \nsustainable development strategies (NSDSs). Five years later, the Rio+5 Summit2 reiterated the \nneed to formulate the NSDSs. And at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 5 years \nlater again, the GMS countries committed to the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation,3 which \ncalled upon them to formulate NSDSs and begin its implementation by 2005.   \n \n2.  The  GMS  countries  have  promulgated  many  strategies  and  policies  on  economic \ngrowth, social welfare, and environment conservation. However, an integrated methodology has \ngenerally not been used and resulted in few practical approaches. During the Ninth Meeting of \nthe  GMS  Working  Group  on  Environment  in  December  2003,  the  country  representatives \nrecognized  the  importance  of  strengthening  and  institutionalizing  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of sustainable development strategies on a national and subregional basis.  The \nrepresentatives unanimously supported the overall concept of the proposal on Capacity Building \nfor Promoting Sustainable Development in the Greater Mekong Subregion4 to meet this need, to \nassist in meeting the Millennium Development Goals\u2019 (MDGs) requirements, and to complement \nwork being done through the ADB-financed Strategic Environment Framework II.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Rio Conference recommended that the NSDS process be built on existing social, \neconomic, and environmental policies and plans. Over the last decade, countries in the GMS \nhave formulated many policies and programs relating to economic growth, social welfare, and \nenvironment conservation. These include the: Socio-Economic Development Plan (1996\u20132000) \nand National Environmental Action Plan (1998\u20132003) in Cambodia; National Environmental \nAction Plan (1993) in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; National Policy and Prospective \nPlan for the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environment Quality (1997\u20132016) in \nThailand;  Strategy  of  Socio-Economic  Development  2010  and  Strategy  of  Environmental \nProtection 2010 in Viet Nam; and Agenda 21 (1994) in the People\u2019s Republic of China. GMS \ncountries  have  also  developed  a  comprehensive  poverty  reduction  strategy.  Most  GMS \ncountries  acknowledge  that  a  better  coordinated  and  formalized  relationship  between  their \nplanning and environment institutions is needed to build on existing processes and to produce \nmore viable strategies.   \n \n4.  Given the commitments made to Agenda 21, the MDGs, and the Johannesburg Plan of \nimplementation, each GMS country needs to develop an NSDS by 2005. To achieve this, it is \n                                                 \n1 In 1992, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, often referred to as the \"Rio Summit,\" adopted the    \nAgenda 21 as a blueprint toward pursuing sustainable development for the 21st century. \n2 In 1997, the Rio+5 Summit was held in Johannesburg to follow up on progress made on the implementation of    \nAgenda 21.  \n3  The action plan to implement the recommendation of the Rio+5 Summit. \n4  The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (internet edition) on 04 February 2004. \n5  ADB. 2002.

", "  2\nessential to develop strong mechanisms to mainstream the environment into national planning \nand budget processes. These mechanisms may be different in each country but would build on \nrelevant processes such as poverty reduction strategies, national environmental action plans, or \ncompetitiveness  strategies.  A  coherent  mechanism  would  integrate  existing  processes, \neliminate redundancies, and engage participation from the government, business, and civil \nsociety. Existing processes in the GMS have generally not been able to effectively mainstream \nthe environment into national planning and budget processes. Long-term vision, transparency, \nand clear priorities have proven elusive. Mechanisms established to address economic, social, \nenvironmental, and development issues were set up in isolation of each other. This integration \nneeds to start immediately to meet existing commitments.    \n \n5.   The GMS countries agreed at the Rio+5 Summit that a multistakeholders structure \nproviding  government,  business,  and  civil  society  a  common  platform  would  be  useful  in \ndeveloping a more practical NSDS. Participatory processes need to be relevant, focused, and \nappropriately  inclusive  to  fulfill  their  potential.  A  strong  participatory  process  needs  to  be \nformalized  in  the  GMS  countries  to  broaden  input  and  strengthen  ownership  of  these \nmechanisms. \n \n6.  Many of the economic and environmental challenges facing the GMS involve more than \none member country by their very nature. Whether it is a shared watershed, airshed, forest \nresources, coastline, or wetlands, some issues demand a regional approach. Comprehensive \nplanning for the sustainable development of natural resources in the GMS will need to take on a \nregional or subregional scope. With the exception of the Mekong River Commission and its \nmandate, no subregional planning mechanism or platform for discussion exists to address these \ntransboundary issues. An institutional framework needs to be developed to provide a platform to \nidentify and address common medium- and long-term goals, pursuant to the MDGs, as well as \nto evaluate progress in these areas through agreed indicators. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The purpose of this technical assistance (TA) is to build capacity of GMS countries to \nintegrate social, economic, and environmental objectives into existing planning mechanisms for \nsustainable  development  on  both  national  and  subregional  levels.  Outputs  include  (i)  a \ndiagnostic assessment of existing policies, strategies, planning mechanisms, and capacities; (ii) \nconsultations and training workshops for stakeholders on integrating sustainable development \nobjectives into existing policies and strategies;  (iii) country-specific guidelines for preparing the \nNSDSs; (iv) country-specific guidelines, including institutional frameworks for public participation \nin  integrated  planning  processes;  (v)  an  institutional  framework  for  a  subregional  planning \nmechanism on environment issues; (vi) a report to establish indicators for evaluating regional \nsustainable  development  planning;  (vii)  a  report  on  connecting  sustainable  development \nplanning  to  help  GMS  countries  meet  their  MDGs;  and  (viii)  a  subregional  sustainable \ndevelopment strategy to provide vision, goals, and targets for sustainable development in GMS.    \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Several consultative and training workshops will be held to help develop guidelines and \nbuild  capacity  for  integrating  environment  into  economic  planning.  International  and  local \nconsultants will work with governments and stakeholders in the GMS countries to (i) develop \ngeneric  guidelines  on  national  sustainable  development  planning  and  related  participatory ", "  3 \n \n \nmechanisms;  (ii)  provide  in-country  training  to  stakeholders  on  process  and  content  of \nsustainable  development  and  sustainable  development  strategy,  to  facilitate  improved \nparticipatory processes related to mainstreaming environment into national planning and budget \nprocesses;  (iii)  develop  country-specific  guidelines  for  national  sustainable  development \nplanning, including roles, principles, elements, and processes; (iv) develop country-specific \nguidelines for participatory mechanisms, defining roles, political commitment, legal mandates, \ncomposition,  structures,  functions,  funding,  and  reporting  procedure;  (v)  help  establish  a \nparticipatory mechanism at the national level following the guidelines; (vi) help develop national \nprocesses to integrate sustainable development principles into existing policies and strategies \nso countries can develop NSDSs; (vii) generate national action plans on capacity building to \nmainstream environment into economic development planning; (viii) help develop an institutional \nframework  for  GMS  countries  to  discuss  and  address  transboundary  issues  through  a \nparticipatory  process;  (ix)  develop  a  concept paper  on  common  indicators  to  evaluate  the \nprogress of sustainable development strategies; (x) develop a report quantifying near- and \nmedium-term targets necessary for GMS countries to achieve their MDG 7, and (xi) develop and \noperate a GMS web site on the integrated sustainable development planning processes.  \n \n9.  Inception, diagnostic, and/or training workshops will be organized in each participating \ncountry to facilitate the process of identifying needs and building capacities among government, \nprivate sector, and major groups. The state of sustainable development will also be reviewed \nduring the training workshop. Capacity building will help build awareness, enhance committed \nparticipation, share information, and promote knowledge and understanding on sustainable \ndevelopment.  An  outline  for  country-specific  guidelines  on  participatory  processes  and \nintegrating environment into the national development planning processes will be developed \nduring the training workshop. Each GMS country will be responsible for selecting of suitable \nparticipants, representing all stakeholders, in the training workshop.  \n \n10.  Participating countries will initiate a process to establish a multistakeholder structure \nfollowing specific guidelines outlining the role, political commitments, mandate, composition, \nstructure, and functions. This structure should be composed of members from governments, \nprivate, and major groups as identified in Agenda 21. The number of members will be decided \nby the national government.  \n \n11.  The  process  of  developing  guidelines  and  a  system  for  an  NSDS  will  include  (i) \nreviewing policies and strategies relating to economic, social, and environment; (ii) assessing  \nthe  scope  of  integrating  principles  of  sustainable  development  into  existing  strategies;  (iii) \nbuilding on strategies to achieve convergence, complementarities, coherence, and coordination \nbetween frameworks, including poverty reduction strategic papers and national environment \naction plans; (iv) developing a strategy planning framework that has a long-term vision of \nsustainable  development  with  clear  goals  and  objectives;  (v)  engaging  all  important  line \nministries; (vi) effectively involving the private sector and civil society in the process; and (vii) \nreviewing  and  finalizing  the  NSDSs  through  national  consultations  and  participatory \nmechanisms.  \n \n12.  The  process  of  developing  guidelines  and  a  system  for  a  subregional  sustainable \ndevelopment  strategy  will  include  developing  a  mechanism  to  (i)  identify  common  and \ntransboundary issues through a participatory process; (ii) analyze key challenges and their links \nwith global and national levels and underlying causes; (iii) analyze the actual or potential short- \nand  long-term  impacts  of  approaches  to  deal  with  them,  and  corresponding  policy  and \ninstitutional framework; (iv) facilitate participation of concerned stakeholders in the process; and \n   ", "  4\n(v) develop a regional sustainable development strategy with an aim to achieve long-term \nsustainability in the region.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent \non a grant basis from the Japan\u2019s Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) will provide additional funding of $200,000. \nThe GMS governments will make in-kind contributions in the form of office space, local travel, \nremuneration  of  counterpart  professional  and  support  staff,  cost  of  data  acquisition,  office \nfacilities  and  utilities,  use  of  available  equipment,  and  all  data.  These  contributions  are \nestimated at $100,000 in total.  Detailed cost estimates are presented in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee for the TA will be \nestablished with representatives of the GMS countries, ADB, and UNEP and will be chaired by \nADB  representative.  Members  from  the  GMS  countries  will  be  selected  from  national \norganizations serving either on the GMS Working Group on Environment or as a national \nimplementing  agency  (NIA)  for  the  TA.  Steering  committee  meetings  will  be  held  before \nimportant subregional and national activities are undertaken and will take place either in actual \nmeetings or through teleconferencing.  A project monitoring feedback mechanism and regular \nreporting  will  facilitate  effective  implementation  of  the  TA.  NIAs  will  assist  in  information \ngathering, analysis, and local logistics. \n \n15.   The TA secretariat will be established at the UNEP Regional Research Center (RRC) in \nBangkok. A full-time TA coordinator will be appointed by UNEP-RRC and financed by UNEP. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Office \nspace and basic office equipment will be provided by UNEP and implementing agencies in GMS \ncountries. Computers and software approved for use during the TA will be procured by ADB \nthrough the TA secretariat in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The terms of \nreference for consulting services are outlined in Appendix 3 and the implementation schedule is \ngiven in Appendix 4. An NIA will serve as the national focal point in each participating country \nresponsible for implementing the project. The host country will identify the NIA in cooperation \nwith ADB. \n \n16.  The TA will be completed in 2 years, commencing in November 2004 and ending in \nSeptember 2006. The inception report will be discussed in a workshop in the third month after \nthe mobilization of the TA coordinator. Quarterly progress reports will be prepared by the TA \nsecretariat, published on the RRC web site, and discussed via the Internet. The interim report \nsummarizing the progress and outlining the continuing work will be discussed in a 3-day interim \nreview workshop in June 2005.  The final workshop, to discuss the final report, will be held in \nJune 2006. To ensure that the TA will be well implemented, ADB, in consultation with UNEP, \nwill monitor and periodically review the progress of its implementation through (i) quarterly \nprogress reports; (ii) a review workshop held every year with participation from the countries, \nthe steering committee organizations, and other potential funding organizations; and (iii) at least \nthree review missions, particularly to review the inception, interim, and draft final reports.   \n \n \n ", "  5 \n \n \nIV.
