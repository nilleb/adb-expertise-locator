THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation1 on (i) a proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  Mongolia  for  the  Regional  Logistics Development \nProject.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Historically, Mongolia has been a north\u2013south land bridge from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) to the Russian Federation on the way to Europe. The transport sector, which mainly \nconsists of roads and railways, is a key driver of economic development in Mongolia. The road \nnetwork, including state and local roads, is about 49,250 kilometers (km) long, connecting 21 \nmajor cities and towns and 160 smaller villages. The 1,810 km Mongolian railway system \ncarries more than 90% of the freight. The main line connecting the PRC\u2019s rail system in the \nsouth with the Russian Federation\u2019s Trans-Siberian line in the north was completed in 1955. It is \nthe lifeline of the economy, and most of the economic development in the country during the past \n55 years has taken place along this corridor. The strategic location of Mongolia as a transit \ncountry between the PRC and the Russian Federation has contributed to the demand for \ntransport. Rapid economic growth in recent years has boosted that demand. Although the \nvolume of transportation has increased, it has not kept pace with the rising demand. This \nconstrains Mongolia\u2019s ability to achieve its full economic growth potential. \n \n3.  Since 2003, Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown 7%\u201310% a year, raising \nthe per capita GDP from $638 in 2004 to $1,560 in 2009. Growth in the mining sector contributed \na large part of the economic expansion. The discovery of huge mineral and coal reserves, \nparticularly in south Gobi, is expected to continue stimulating growth in the mining industry in the \ncoming years. This will contribute to the high GDP growth rates. The mining industry and the \ndevelopment of the secondary and tertiary sector depend on efficient transportation and logistics. \nMost of the mining products are expected to be shipped to the PRC or to international markets \nthrough Tianjin port in the PRC. These shipments would generally have to pass through Zamyn \nUud, the main gateway to the south.  \n \n4.  Mongolia is also a landlocked country, and such countries face greater transportation \nchallenges. Mongolia has to depend upon the Russian Federation and the PRC for access to \nseaports. In recent years, trade flows have been reoriented from the Russian Federation so that \nmore than 80% of the imports now come from the PRC through the southeast border point in \nZamyn Uud. Most of Mongolia\u2019s exports also transit through Zamyn Uud on their way to Tianjin \nport, the only PRC port available to Mongolia for international trade. As a consequence, the traffic \nhandled at Zamyn Uud has grown rapidly in recent years. Zamyn Uud is now badly congested,3 \nwhich is delaying imports, exports, and transit traffic. Although a number of factors contribute to \nthese delays (unavailable rolling stock, change of gauge, and delays at customs), the main reason \nis the inadequate logistics in Mongolia, particularly at Zamyn Uud. \n \n5.  Efficient  and  well-developed  logistics  are  essential  for  cost-effective  and  competitive \ntransportation. Trade logistics\u2014the capacity to connect to international markets to ship goods\u2014\nis essential for developing countries to improve their competitiveness, reap the benefits of \n                                                 \n1  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, \n2009\u20132012. Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Discussions with stakeholders revealed that import cargoes could take 10\u201360 days for clearance at Zamyn Uud.  ", "2 \nglobalization, and fight poverty more effectively in an increasingly integrated world. A World \nBank-funded study4 based on a global survey of international freight forwarders and express \ncarriers indicated that facilitating the capacity to connect firms, suppliers, and consumers is \ncrucial in a world where predictability and reliability are becoming even more important than \ncosts. A country\u2019s ability to connect to global markets is fast becoming a key aspect of its \ncapacity to compete, grow, attract investment, create jobs, and reduce poverty. Mongolia\u2019s \nperformance in all logistics indicators is poor. Based on a worldwide survey completed by more \nthan 800 logistics professionals, the World Bank has developed a comprehensive cross-country \nassessment  of  logistics  performance  in  155  countries\u2014the  logistics  performance  index.5 \nMongolia has an overall logistics performance index ranking of 141 (1 is the best, 155 is the \nworst).6 It ranks 149 for customs procedures, 144 for logistics costs (including freight rates), 133 \nfor infrastructure quality, 122 for its ability to track and trace shipments, and 147 for timeliness in \nreaching a destination. Mongolia\u2019s ranking indicates serious problems in the development of \nlogistics. These are hurting the country\u2019s competitiveness and have serious repercussions for \noverall economic performance.  \n \n6.  Zamyn Uud, a town with a population of about 13,000, is the intermodal interchange point \nfor traffic coming from the PRC and Mongolia to the Russian Federation and Europe, and vice \nversa. It handles road-to-rail, rail-to-rail, and road-to-road traffic. Most of the import traffic into \nMongolia  and  transit  traffic  to  the  Russian  Federation  coming  from  the  PRC  (including \ninternational traffic from Tianjin port) by rail is transshipped to rail. In recent years, the volume of \ntraffic coming by road from the PRC has increased. Most of this traffic is transshipped to rail at \nZamyn  Uud.  Only  a  small  portion  of  the  traffic  coming  by  road  from  the  PRC  is  directly \ntransshipped by road because there is no paved road between Zamyn Uud and Ulaanbaatar, or to \nthe Russian Federation border in the north.7 Most of the goods coming into Mongolia are destined \nfor Ulaanbaatar, the capital, with construction material and foodstuff accounting for the bulk of the \ncargo. Because of the limited logistics facilities at Zamyn Uud, it can take 50\u201360 days to get \nshipments to Ulaanbaatar. The development of the mining sector will create a huge demand in \nfuture for transporting coal and minerals, and this cannot be met by the existing logistics facilities. \n \n7.  To handle the traffic at Zamyn Uud, two facilities were created, one of which was financed \nby a grant from the Government of Japan in 1995. An additional temporary facility was opened on \n11 June 2008. The three facilities are basic\u2014they have no warehouses, limited and outdated \nequipment for handling material, no planned layout, no transshipment facilities from road to rail, \nand no heavy duty cranes.  \n \n8.  The government supports the development of intermodal transport and seeks to build a \nstrong logistics network in the country to improve Mongolia\u2019s global competitiveness. Because \nof its geographic location, Mongolia is the focal point for international transit trade between the \nPRC, the Russian Federation, and Europe. The government is a signatory to a number of \nbilateral and multilateral agreements with neighboring countries and international organizations \nto facilitate international transport through Mongolia. To address the urgent need to improve \nlogistics, the Government of Mongolia asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \ndevelopment of multimodal logistics facilities at Zamyn Uud.  \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2010. Connecting to Compete: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy. Washington, DC. \n5  It aggregates the performance in seven areas\u2014from traditional ones, such as customs procedures, logistics costs \n(including freight rates), and infrastructure quality, to new areas such as the ability to track and trace shipments, \ntimeliness in reaching a destination, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry. The survey had the \nsupport and participation of the International Association of Freight Forwarders, the Global Express Association, \nthe Global Facilitation Partnership, and the Turku School of Economics. \n6  The only country in Asia with lower rankings than Mongolia is Afghanistan. \n7  A two-lane road from Choyr to Zamyn Uud, partially financed by ADB, is under construction and expected to be \ncompleted by the end of 2012. \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB has led efforts by international development partners in Mongolia\u2019s transport sector \nwith a combination of policy-level and project-level interventions. ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for Mongolia8 and the regional cooperation strategy and program update for Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)9 identify transport as a strategically important \nsector for ADB assistance. Since 1993, ADB has approved four loans and one grant for roads \nand one loan for aviation development with an overall amount of $184.7 million. In addition, \nADB has financed 12 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $6.37 million for the transport \nsector. The first four loans supported the rehabilitation and upgrading of Mongolia\u2019s first north\u2013\nsouth corridor (CAREC corridor 4b).10 The United Nations Economics and Social Commission \nfor Asia and Pacific designated the corridor as part of the Asian Highway Network (Asian \nHighway 3). In western Mongolia, ADB is supporting the development of the first phase from \nYarant to Hovd (431 km) of a second north\u2013south corridor in Mongolia (CAREC corridor 4a). \nThis corridor is about 750 km long, running from the border with the PRC at Yarant, through \nHovd and Olgiy, to the border with the Russian Federation at Tsagaannuur. It is also part of the \nAsian Highway Network (Asian Highway 4). ADB has not provided any assistance for railway \ndevelopment in Mongolia. In trade facilitation, ADB has financed six TA projects, including five \nregional TA projects and one loan for customs modernization. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia identifies the underdeveloped transport \nnetwork and inefficient cross-border transport as major sector problems. Its regional cooperation \nstrategy and program update for CAREC identifies multimodal transport as a strategic priority \nand the development of multimodal facilities at Zamyn Uud as a key intervention for possible \nADB assistance. The recent ADB sector assistance program evaluation (SAPE) also identifies \nlogistics as an area for future support.11 \n \n11.  The SAPE found that ADB\u2019s past program for transport was successful, noting that \nADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the sector were well aligned with Mongolia\u2019s needs. The executing \nagencies for completed and ongoing ADB-financed transport projects in Mongolia have shown \nstrong commitment and generally satisfactory project implementation capabilities. The agencies \nhave generally complied with loan covenants. Environmental management was carried out \nsatisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in a timely manner, and the audited financial \nstatements were generally acceptable.  \n \n12.  The key lessons from the completed transport projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency for project processing, implementation, and operation has adequate \ncapacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; and (iii) review traffic constraints on a network \nbasis. These lessons were incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n13.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia. It will be \nADB\u2019s first intervention in the Mongolia transport sector that emphasizes the integration of \ndifferent modes. This will be achieved through the development of a modern logistics facility, \nwhich will lower dwell time,12 increase efficiency, expand network capacity, achieve optimal use \n                                                 \n8  Mongolia\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132015, is being developed and is expected to be finalized by January \n2011. \n9  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n10 The first project for rehabilitating the Altanbulag\u2013Ulaanbaatar section was completed in 2001 and was rated highly \nsuccessful. The second project for developing the Nalayh\u2013Choyr section was completed in 2005 and was also \nrated as successful. Implementation of the third road project is ongoing. The SAPE rated ADB\u2019s overall support for \nthe transport sector successful. \n11 ADB. 2008. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation: Roads and Railways in Mongolia.

All of these will lead to more efficient \ntransport services.  \n \n14.  The project will be implemented in Zamyn Uud, a poor and isolated desert area where \nrural people rely mainly on herding livestock. Inadequate and expensive transport services have \nlimited economic opportunities. The local authorities and people living in the area see the \ndevelopment of the logistics facility as a way to address this problem and create more service \nsector employment in towns. Logistics development is part of the government\u2019s program for the \nintegrated development of a free economic zone in the area. This facility is expected to play an \nimportant role in the economic development of Zamyn Uud and the area, and will enable and \nstimulate international, regional, and domestic trade. The proposed project is in line with the \nNational Development Plan and the government's Regional Development Strategy.13 \n \n15.  The project is a key intervention in the transport sector that will bring many technical, \noperational, safety, and economic benefits. It will establish a well-developed logistics terminal, \nequipped with modern technology and managed by the private sector through a management \ncontract. This will enhance logistics efficiency, increase throughput, and improve reliability\u2014all \nof which will lead to a more affordable, faster, cheaper, and safer transport services in Mongolia. \nThe proposed ADB support is expected to facilitate the flow of foreign and private capital to \nfinance the logistics development in Mongolia. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the project is the international and regional trade promoted in Mongolia. \nThe outcome of the project will be an efficient, competitive, and reliable multimodal transport \nsystem at Zamyn Uud.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The output of the project will be the development of a multimodal facility, with facilities \nfor  road-to-road,  road-to-rail,  and  rail-to-rail  transshipment  at  Zamyn  Uud.  The  project  will \ndevelop an integrated intermodal container terminal with customs and quarantine facilities, as \nwell as rail and road access. Terminal equipment and management systems will be procured \nand installed. Upon completion, the facility will be operated by the private sector through a \nmanagement contract. ADB will provide support for institutional capacity strengthening in the \nareas of (i) detailed design, (ii) implementation supervision, (iii) staff capacity development, \n(iv) environmental management, and (v) selection and execution of a management contract.  \n \nD.  Special Features \n18.  First  intervention  to  promote  multimodal  transport.  The  project  is  ADB\u2019s  first \nintervention  to  promote  multimodal  transport  and  the  first  such  intervention  in  Mongolia\u2019s \ntransport  sector.  It  is  also  the  first  ADB  project  to  promote  coordinated  improvements  in \ntransport infrastructure and trade facilitation, including a logistics center; harmonized cross-\nborder regulations, procedures, and standards; and customs and quarantine modernization.  \n \n19.  Private  sector  participation. The project will support private sector participation in \nterminal operations, equipment leasing, warehousing, and light manufacturing. It will stimulate \nprivate investment in ancillary industries, container freight stations, and other logistic support \nfunctions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, insurance, trucking, and warehousing \nin and around the terminal for dry and refrigerated cargo. The project is also expected to \n                                                 \n13 Government of Mongolia. 2008. National Development Strategy: 2007\u20132021. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "5 \nincrease opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships and private sector investments to develop \ntransport infrastructure in Ulaanbaatar and south Gobi.  \n \n20.  Integrated approach to logistics development. ADB policy dialogue has emphasized \nthe need to integrate different transport modes in order to provide efficient and cost-effective \ntransport services. The project seeks to achieve this by providing investment support to develop \nan integrated multimodal logistics facility in Zamyn Uud. Five principles have been followed in \ndesigning the facility: (i) nondiscriminatory access to the terminal; (ii) railside access for all \nlicensed railway undertakings; (iii) roadside access to all operators; (iv) transparent capacity \nallocation and pricing; and (v) bundling of different cargoes (refrigerated and containers) and \nmarket segments (international and domestic), resulting in improved capacity utilization. \n \n21.  Terminal capacity management. The project will adopt international best practices for \ncapacity  management,  including  a  sophisticated  information-technology-based  capacity \nmanagement system and terminal management software applications (for example, customs \nadministration information system, customs external portal system, risk management system, \ndata warehouse system, and automated loading unit identification system). The equipment to be \nprocured will be the most modern available in the market, consistent with the needs of current \ndevelopment in the logistics industry. The technologies will be compatible and adaptable to \nexisting systems, and will be proven and scalable. The trial and testing period will be sufficient \nto ensure their successful operation. Adequate maintenance spares and staff training will be \nprovided to support their sustainability.  \n \n22.  Institutional  and  capacity  development.  The  project  will  support  institutional \ndevelopment  and  the  enhancement  of  staff  capacity.  Working  with  the  Ministry  of  Road, \nTransportation,  Construction  and  Urban  Development  (MRTCUD),  the  project  management \nconsultants will review the existing institutional arrangements of the Mongolia Railway Authority, \nmake recommendations for strengthening it, and undertake capacity development programs. \nCapacity development support will also be provided to increase private sector participation, and \nto select and execute a management contract to operate the facility upon completion. About 50 \nstaff will be trained, and technical exchanges on logistics management will be organized. \n \nE.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n23.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $71.64  million,  including  taxes  and  duties, \ncontingencies, and interest and other charges during implementation. Table 1 summarizes the \ninvestment  plan.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  quantities  derived  from  preliminary \nengineering designs and unit rates reflecting market prices for goods and materials.  \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounts \nA.

The project will (i) reduce logistics costs, promote international trade, and \nenable Mongolia to earn foreign exchange; (ii) enable shippers to benefit from lower transport \ncosts; (iii) benefit consumers and producers of goods and services through the provision of \ntimely  and  efficient  transport  services,  and  lower  logistics  costs;  and  (iv) improve  trade \ncompetitiveness, enabling exporters and importers to benefit from lower costs. The combined \nbenefits and impacts outweigh the costs, and net benefits will accrue to the project area.  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  The economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the \u201cwith-project\u201d and \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenarios. The project will reduce the cost of freight transport to and from \nMongolia.  The  economic  costs  include  (i)  initial  investment  in  fixed  assets  and  facilities, \ncontainer and terminal handling equipment, logistics center management systems, and customs \nand quarantine equipment; (ii) additional investment in repair and maintenance of assets and \nequipment renewal; (iii) change in working capital; and (iv) recurring costs, including fixed and \nvariable operating costs. The economic benefits include (i) time savings for rail-to-rail, rail-to-\ntruck,  truck-to-rail,  and  truck-to-truck  loading  operations;  (ii)  diverted  traffic  cost  savings, \nconsisting of containerization benefits of current rail and road traffic that is not containerized; \n ", "8 \n(iii) diverted  traffic,  cargo  loss  or  damage,  and  logistics  cost  savings;  and  (iv) generated \ntransport benefits. The economic internal rate of return indicates that the project is economically \nviable. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project's economic viability. Changes \nin the key variables do not affect economic viability significantly.  \n \n29.  Financial projections, prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects,15 assessed the financial viability and sustainability of the \nproject. The projected financial statements indicate that revenues will be sufficient to cover \noperation and maintenance costs, income taxes, and debt service; and provide a reasonable \nrate of return. The financial evaluation was undertaken in real terms using constant 2010 prices. \nThe project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real \nterms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation, and currency \nfluctuation.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits  were  derived  under  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. The  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  compares \nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis. The \nproject  is  financially  viable  and  sustainable. Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  indicate  that  the \nfinancial internal rate of return for the project is robust under assumptions of plausible variability. \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocument and contracts. The recruitment of consultants will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government and \nthe MRTCUD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in \nthe PAM (footnote 14). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  An efficient, multimodal facility will enable the efficient flow of goods, promoting trade \nand development of the local economy of Zamyn Uud. It will help increase standards of living \nand  reduce  poverty  by  removing  transport  constraints  to  sustainable  economic  growth. \nProviding efficient, multimodal transportation in underserved, less-developed areas will create \nthe conditions necessary for developing local resources, and creating jobs and other income-\ngenerating opportunities. The major project beneficiaries will be (i) the government, which will \nbenefit from higher trade earnings; (ii) consumers, who will benefit from affordable products; and \n(iii) freight shippers, who will benefit from less damage to shipments and more affordable, faster, \nand safer shipment deliveries. The poor will benefit from the local economic improvement and \nemployment generation. \n \n33.  The jobs created by the development of the logistics facility at Zamyn Uud will provide \npotential new sources of income for women and other vulnerable groups. They will benefit from \nmultimodal development and have equal access to employment and wages. The development \nwill  generate  demand  for  local  labor  and  increase  worker  productivity  and  wages.  The \nexpansion of secondary and tertiary industries will generate additional jobs for men and women \nclose to their homes. By participating more fully in the labor market, women will increase their \nnet income and savings, improve overall family welfare, and upgrade their status.  \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2006. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \n34.  Economic  development  has  generated  some  adverse  social  impacts,  including \nincreased risk of HIV/AIDS or sexually transmitted infections, and human and drug trafficking. \nThese particularly affect vulnerable groups, including women and girls.16 Such adverse trends \ncould increase as trade expands. Stakeholders were consulted about these potential social \nimpacts during project preparation. A consultation and participation plan will be carried out \nduring project implementation. \n \n35.  This project will seek to increase awareness and prevent such social impacts. The \nmeasures to achieve this are set out in the environmental management plan of the draft initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE).17 Some  will  be  focused  on  the  project  site  (the  logistics \nterminal)  and  managed  by  the  Mongolian  Railway  Authority;  others  will  assist  the  local \ncommunity in Zamyn Uud with the support of the local government. Funding support will also be \nmade available through an ADB-financed TA project for HIV/AIDS prevention.18 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n36.  The  project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  The  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultants prepared a draft IEE, including an environmental monitoring plan and a grievance \nredress mechanism. The IEE was submitted to the Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tourism \nfor review and endorsement. The project could have adverse environmental impacts in the \nfollowing areas: (i) soil erosion from cut and fill; (ii) deterioration of underground water quality of \nadjacent  waterways;  and  (iii)  public  health  and  safety,  including  HIV/AIDS  or  sexually \ntransmitted  infections.  The  IEE  concluded  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be \nsuccessfully  mitigated  through  the  use  of  best  practices  and  appropriate  technologies. \nImplementation  of  the  environmental  management,  mitigation,  and  monitoring  programs \nincluded in the IEE will ensure compliance with ADB and government environmental guidelines \nand procedures. Regular monitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and \nregulations are followed.  \n \n37.  The site for the logistics terminal is vacant desert land owned by the government. No \none resides on or uses the land. The road that will connect with the main highway to the site \ndoes not require any land acquisition, or demolition of structures or trees. Therefore, the project \nis classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Zamyn Uud does not have any ethnic \nminority  communities;  the  area  is  settled  by  Khalkh  people,  the  dominant  ethnic  group  in \nMongolia. Some minority households have migrated to Zamyn Uud for work, but they have been \nincorporated into the local community. The project is classified as category C for indigenous \npeoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The  project  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \neconomic circumstances would have to become substantially worse for the project to lose its \neconomic viability. Risks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. \nThe project is a high-priority investment supported by the government. The development of this \nfacility will increase the trade competitiveness of Mongolia and promote industrial development, \nwhich will stimulate economic development. Macroeconomic conditions are expected to be \nfavorable in view of the expected development of major mining operations in south Gobi. Stable \neconomic performance is expected based on the government's projections and growth trends. \n                                                 \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2008.

The equipment and materials to be procured are based on proven technologies. The use \nof project management consultants will ensure that the design is robust and the facility is \ndeveloped in a timely  manner. A  potential risk is a delay in implementation, which would \npostpone the project benefits. However, MRTCUD has experience implementing ADB-financed \nprojects, has adequate capacity, and will set up a project implementation unit with personnel \nexperienced in project implementation. The consulting services provided under the project will \nhelp  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  Mongolian  Railway  Authority  and  the  project \nimplementation unit. The steering committee set up to coordinate implementation will support \nsmooth coordination among line ministries, different agencies, and stakeholders; and provide \nguidance to support the timely completion of the project. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n40.  The Government of Mongolia and MRTCUD have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan and grant documents. \n \n41.  The Government of Mongolia and MRTCUD have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the financing agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR25,358,000 to Mongolia for the \nRegional Logistics Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to the \nBoard; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $5,000,000 to Mongolia, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources,  for  the  Regional  Logistics  Development  Project,  on  terms  and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nfinancing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n \n19 November 2010 \n                                                 \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nInternational and  Mongolia international trade  Government statistics  Macroeconomic targets \nregional trade  increased by 100% in 2020    achieved \npromoted in Mongolia   compared with 2009   \nAssociated facilities \n   \nand infrastructure \nPRC\u2013Mongolia trade   \ndeveloped \nincreased by 120% in 2020 \ncompared with 2009 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAn efficient,  Freight traffic handled at  MRTCUD statistics and  Traffic forecast for \ncompetitive, and  Zamyn Uud increased by  post-evaluation surveys  Zamyn Uud realized \nreliable multimodal  80% by 2018 compared   \nShippers and freight \ntransport system  with 2009   \noperators realize the \ndeveloped at Zamyn     \nbenefits of using the \nUud  Container traffic volume  Post-evaluation surveys \nfacility \n  increased by 100% by 2018  and reports from \ncompared with 2009  MRTCUD \n   \nWaiting time at Zamyn Uud \nreduced by 50% in 2018 \ncompared with 2009 \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
