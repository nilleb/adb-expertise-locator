INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming mission in November 2011, the Government of the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC) in elaborating a comprehensive road map for the demonstration and \ndeployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS)1 in the PRC including an in-depth techno-\neconomic  feasibility  assessment  of  the  oxy-fuel  combustion  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  capture \n2\ntechnology.2 During a fact-finding mission in April 2012, the TA\u2019s design, impact and outcome, \nmethodology  and  key  activities,  scope,  cost estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements were agreed with NDRC and the Ministry of Finance. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As  a  result  of  energy-intensive  economic  growth,  a  particularly  rapid  increase  in \nelectricity demand, and heavy reliance on carbon-intensive coal in its energy mix, the PRC now \naccounts for about 20% of global primary energy and about half of global coal consumption.4 \nThe PRC is one of the world\u2019s largest emitters of CO , the major greenhouse gas responsible \n2\nfor climate change TheInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that 720 million tons (72%) \n.   \nof the incremental 1 gigaton of CO  emissions globally in 2011 originated from the PRC. The \n2\ngovernment, during its Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, committed to reducing its energy \nintensity  by  20%5 and  promoting  rapid  development  of  renewable  energy.6 Without  this \ncommitment,  the  IEA  estimates  that  the  PRC\u2019s  emissions  in  2011  would  have  exceeded \n1.5 gigatons because of a much higher increase in coal consumption for power generation and \nby heavy industries. In 2009, the PRC committed to reducing its carbon intensity by 40%\u201345% \nby 2020, compared with 2005. Considering the latest emission trajectory, it is essential to fast-\ntrack more effective decarbonization of economic growth, particularly in power generation and \nheavy industry output.7 \n \n3.  The government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 emphasizes a \u201cgreen, low-carbon \ndevelopment concept\u201d with the targets of (i) increasing the proportion of non-fossil fuels in total \nenergy consumption to 11.4%, and (ii) reducing carbon intensity by 17%. Notwithstanding, the \nPRC is expected to add large fossil-fuel-based power generation plants to meet the growing \nelectricity demand and to sustain economic growth.8 Even with very strong incentives for energy \nefficiency, renewable and other low-carbon technologies, including nuclear power, coal is likely \nto remain a dominant part of the PRC\u2019s energy mix until at least 2035. The urgent deployment of \n                                                 \n1  The CCS is an integrated system of technologies involving (i) separation and capture of CO  from large emitting \n2\nsources, (ii) compression of captured CO  and its transportation to a geological site, and (iii) injecting CO  in \n2 2\nsuitable geological formation underground for storage. Oxy-fuel combustion is one of the three main CO  capture \n2\ntechnologies. Others are pre-combustion and post-combustion technologies.    \n2  The TA is included as Oxy-fuel Combustion Carbon Capture for Power Plant and CCS Road Map for Industrial \nApplications in ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 June 2012. \n4  In 2011, the PRC\u2019s total energy consumption was 3.5 billion tons of coal equivalent. Coal accounted for about 70% \nof the primary energy consumption and 80% of the electricity consumption. Electricity consumption increased \nbetween 1990 and 2010 on average by 10% annually and to date nearly equals that of the United States. \n5  Energy intensity refers to energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product.  \n6  During the Eleventh Five-Year-Plan period, the PRC (i) improved energy efficiency by 19.1%; (ii) increased the \nshare of renewables in the total final energy consumption to 9%; and (iii) shut down 70 gigawatts (GW) of small, \nhigh-polluting coal-fired power plants. \n7  Carbon intensity is the amount of carbon by weight emitted per unit of energy consumed. \n8  The target capacity to be installed over the plan period is 530 GW, of which about 280 GW will be coal-based. \n ", "2  \nthe  full  range  of  low-carbon  technologies,  including  CCS,  is  essential  for  the  PRC  to \ndecarbonize its power sector and achieve its long-term climate change mitigation goals. \n \n4.  CCS is currently the only available near-commercial system of technologies that can cut \nCO   emissions  from  fossil-fuel-based  power  plants  to  the  atmosphere  by  80%\u201390%.  It  is \n2\nincluded  in  all  cost-effective  climate  change  mitigation  strategies  proposed  by  the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the IEA. To avoid catastrophic climate change \nimpacts, global leaders at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change (COP 15) in Copenhagen in 2009 recognized the scientific view \nthat global average temperature rise should be below 2 degrees Celsius (2\u00b0C). This requires \nCO  emissions to be halved by 2050 from their 2009 levels. According to the IEA, CCS could \n2\nachieve about one-fifth of the desired reduction in the least-cost manner. At least 38 projects \nthat fit CCS to power generation are required by 2020 to have an 80% chance of limiting the \ntemperature rise to 2\u00b0C.9 The IEA estimates that the PRC alone would need to build 10\u201312 such \nprojects by 2020. To date, no such plant is in operation anywhere in the world. \n \n5.  Since  2005,  the  government  has  supported  studies,  technology  research,  and  pilot \nprojects as part of the national science and technology programs in cooperation with bilateral \nand multilateral development partners. By 2011, nine pilot projects were operational and the \nessential aspects of CCS demonstration had been studied. The National Program on Climate \nChange includes CCS demonstration as one important action. To date, various government \nagencies  and  energy  companies  have  published  their  road  maps,  each  emphasizing \ncomponents of CCS demonstration. However, these efforts have so far not led to the realization \nof a demonstration project at scale. \n  \n6.  The loan and TA projects that ADB provided to the government have mainly focused on \npre-combustion carbon capture technology.10 They identified several key barriers to large-scale \ndemonstration: (i) low policy priority of CCS; (ii) incomplete policy and regulatory framework; \n(iii) low fiscal and financial support for CCS demonstration projects compared with support for \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects; (iv) inadequate international targeted funding \nmechanisms to support projects in emerging economies; (v) higher capital cost and auxiliary \nenergy consumption, but no additional revenues; and (vi) technical challenges in scaling up \nthese projects. These TA projects produced the following recommendations on how to remove \nbarriers to early-stage demonstration projects: (i) targeted public funding and concessional \nfinancing should be available for such projects;11 (ii) a favorable tariff as applicable to other low-\ncarbon technologies in the power sector should be extended to CCS; and (iii) CCS policy for \ndemonstration should focus on early-stage projects, including those projects that may utilize \nCO  before its geological sequestration. \n2\n \n7.  The  key  conclusion  from  these  TA  projects  is  that  a  staged  approach  to  CCS \ndemonstration and deployment is essential. Such an approach would entail the construction of \n                                                 \n9  IEA. 2012. Energy Technology Perspectives 2012. Paris. \n10 ADB. 2009.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Tianjin Integrated \nGasification Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. Manila. \n11 In November 2011, during the COP 17, CCS has been included in the Clean Development Mechanism as an \neligible clean energy technology. However, revenues from the sale of carbon credits are expected to only partially \nclose the gap in achieving financial viability of CCS projects.  \n ", "  3\nsome early-stage demonstration projects where part of the higher cost is paid for by using the \ncaptured CO  for applications such as enhanced oil recovery.12 Utilization of captured CO  \n2 2\nbefore its storage is often referred to as carbon capture, utilization, and storage. Successful \nCCS application in these early-stage demonstration projects will provide valuable insights and \nkey  learning  opportunities,  and  will  trigger  wider  CCS  demonstration  and  deployment.  A \ncomprehensive road map with consistent policy targets, complemented with adequate policy \ninstruments and support measures, is essential to guide CCS demonstration and deployment. \nPrevious efforts in the PRC show that such a road map will only be effective in paving the way \nfor CCS demonstration if it is steered by NDRC, the leading national energy and climate change \npolicy-making body of the PRC. The TA will meet this key requirement. \n \n8.  Currently, two critical analytical gaps prevent formulation of a comprehensive road map \nand fast-tracking of CCS demonstration and deployment in the PRC. They concern (i) the role of \nthe CCS-ready approach, and (ii) oxy-fuel combustion CO  capture technology. Regarding the \n2\nfirst gap, ADB TA is being implemented to develop capacity on post-combustion CO  capture for \n2\nnatural-gas-based power plants using a CCS-ready approach to avoid carbon lock-in.13 It will \nalso develop country-specific CCS-ready criteria and test those in a small-scale pilot project. It \nwill be important to feed lessons learned into possible new standards for fossil-fuel-based power \nplants, which will directly add to the establishment of a comprehensive policy framework. As for \nthe second gap, oxy-fuel combustion CO  capture technology has so far been tested in the PRC \n2\nonly  in  micro-scale  pilot  projects.14 Its  techno-economic  characteristics  have  not  yet  been \nstudied sufficiently to assess its potential role in the mix of CO capture technologies in the PRC. \n2 \nTo avoid further carbon lock-in, necessary analyses and studies of oxy-fuel combustion CO  \n2\ncapture technology will be undertaken in parallel to the elaboration of a comprehensive CCS \nroad map as part of this TA. \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the government's priorities for developing a comprehensive CCS \npolicy framework and road map for demonstration and deployment. It effectively responds to the \nurgent need to gain in-depth understanding of the techno-economic applicability of oxy-fuel \ncombustion CO  capture technology, the remaining of the three main technologies to capture \n2\nCO . This is a logical next step after ADB\u2019s previous and ongoing CCS TA projects for analysis \n2\nand in-depth understanding of the other two CO  capture technologies\u2014pre-combustion capture \n2\nfrom  coal-based  integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  power  plants  and  post-combustion \ncapture from natural-gas-based power plants. The three studies will feed into comparisons \n(least-cost, cost\u2013benefit, and unique application opportunities) between these technologies for a \ncomprehensive CCS road map elaboration. \n \n10.  The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015, which \nprioritizes promoting environmentally sustainable growth, reducing carbon intensity, innovation \nand knowledge-based support for high-impact low-carbon technologies, and policy reforms to \nestablish an enabling environment for investments in clean energy, which contribute to the \nglobal public good of mitigating climate change.15 \n \n                                                 \n12 The possibility to enhance oil recovery through injecting CO  in oil wells has triggered large-scale CCS uptake in \n2\nthe United States.

The impact will be the staged demonstration of carbon capture and storage in the PRC. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  assessed  techno-economic  feasibility  of  selected  early-stage \ndemonstration projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will consist of two components: component A for formulating a road map for \nCCS demonstration and deployment, and component B for an oxy-fuel combustion CO  capture \n2\ntechnology assessment. Component A will deliver the following outputs: (i) a comprehensive \nroad map for demonstration and deployment of CCS; (ii) a recommended set of suitable policies \nand regulations, and an incentive framework; (iii) a shortlist and ranking of early-stage CCS \ndemonstration projects; (iv) suitable business models for implementing early-stage projects; and \n(v) capacity strengthening measures in policy making, and techno-economic modeling for CCS \nroad map.  \n \n13.  Component B will deliver the following outputs: (i) pre-feasibility assessment of a coal-\nfired  power  plant  applying  oxy-fuel  combustion  CO   capture  technology;  (ii)  established \n2\ntechnical  standards  for  oxy-fuel  combustion  CO   capture  technology;  (iii)  a  CO   storage \n2 2\ncharacterization manual; and (iv) capacity assessment and strengthening measures in analysis, \nplanning, and implementation of oxy-fuel combustion CO  capture technology. \n2\n \n14.  The major assumptions on project output, outcome, and impact are in Appendix 1. The \nTA design factors in critical risks and takes measures to mitigate them. It also defines the key \nlessons from earlier TA projects in the PRC addressing aspects of CCS development. The \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  are  directly  relevant  national  agencies  with  a  clear \nmandate to advance CCS. Nonetheless, CCS entails a complex system of technologies that are \nin the early stage of development and have still weak support from government and civil society. \nSome of the factored-in risks relate to the global dialogue on a new climate change treaty and \navailability of international finances to support early-stage CCS demonstration projects. But \nADB's engagement with the developed countries through the Carbon Sequestration Leadership \nForum and Clean Energy Ministers\u2019 Action Group on Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage \nclearly  indicates  their  strong  desire  to  provide  financing  support  to  early-stage  CCS \ndemonstration projects in the PRC.16 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,600,000, of which $2,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility.17 The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and support facilities, studies, reports, data, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n16 In 2009, the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute contributed A$21.5 million to establish a CCS Fund \nunder ADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. In April 2012, the United Kingdom announced \u00a360 \nmillion funding support for CCS development in developing and emerging countries.   \n17 Established by the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute and administered by ADB. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  NDRC, the government institution responsible for the formulation of energy and climate \nchange policy, and approval of large-scale demonstration projects, will be the executing agency \nfor the TA. The Center for Strategic Studies and International Cooperation on Climate Change, \nattached to NDRC, will be the implementing agency for component A, and Dongfang Boiler will \nbe the implementing agency for component B.18 \n \n17.  Component A will use individual consultants (5 international, 13 person-months; and 10 \nnational, 88 person-months). They will have in-depth knowledge of the PRC\u2019s energy sector, \nincluding the oil, gas, coal-mining, power, and CCS subsectors, as well as the PRC\u2019s energy \npolicy. They will all have previous experience in elaborating road maps and designing energy \npolicy proposals preferably in the PRC. The consulting inputs estimated for component B are 4 \ninternational  consultants  for  12  person-months,  and  8  national  consultants  for  62  person-\nmonths. The tasks under component B will be carried out by a consulting firm that will be \nengaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20). \nThe firm will be required to submit a simplified technical proposal covering all aspects of the \nterms of reference. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for \nconsultants for components A and B are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Procurement of TA-relevant equipment will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Ownership of this equipment \nwill  be  transferred  to  the  relevant  executing  agency  and/or  implementing  agency  after  TA \ncompletion. TA funds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 15 September 2012, with an expected \ncompletion date of 15 March 2014. The consultants will submit an inception report within 1 \nmonth; three interim reports within 6, 10, and 12 months; a draft final report within 16 months; \nand the final report within 18 months of field mobilization.19 Information on the progress of \nimplementation  and  on  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  regular  workshops  and \nseminars. The outcome of the TA will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the government \nin accordance with their respective evaluation policies and requirements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,200,000 to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the Road Map for Carbon Capture \nand Storage Demonstration and Deployment. \n                                                 \n18 Dongfang Boiler is a major state-owned thermal power plant equipment supplier that specializes in developing oxy-\nfuel combustion projects.
