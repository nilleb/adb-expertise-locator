The Project\ncomprises the construction of new facilities for the managing\nand  disposing  of  solid  wastes,  and  for  treating  sludge  from\nhousehold  and  institutional  septic  tanks,  on  both  islands,\ncapacity  building  in  waste  management  operations  and  in\nenvironmental  monitoring  of  waste  management  services;\npreparation of remediation plans for existing waste dumps; and\ndevelopment  of  strategies  for  managing  hazardous  and\nintractable wastes. Facilities for recovering and recycling waste\nmaterials  will  be  introduced  in  Aitutaki,  and  the  Project  will\ncomplement  similar  measures  that  are  being  planned  for\nRarotonga.\nClassification : Poverty  Classification:  Poverty  intervention  (beneficiary\nnonspecific)\nThematic Classification: Environmental protection\nEnvironmental : Category B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken and\na  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  was\ncirculated to the Board on 8 March 2001.\nRationale Rarotonga\u2019s present waste management system is overloaded,\nis damaging the environment, and presents health hazards. The\ncapacity  of  the  present  waste  disposal  landfill  is  almost\nexhausted,  despite  recourse  to  environmentally  unsound\npractices  reducing  waste  volumes.  Aitutaki  has  no  waste\nmanagement facility at all, and wastes are being disposed of in\nan environmentally unsound manner.\nThe Project will halt and reverse the environmental degradation\ncaused  by  inadequate  solid  waste  management  practices  in\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  It  will  provide  facilities  that  will\nsignificantly  enhance  public  health  protection.  The  future  of\ntourism, is one of the country\u2019s principal economic activities,\ndepends to a large extent on the conservation of the country\u2019s\nnatural environment.\nThe Project will help the Government to improve the efficiency\nof urban service delivery through institutional reform, and will\nconsolidate systems for recovering the costs of providing waste\nmanagement services. The Project will provide tangible support\nfor  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  optimizing  private-sector  led\ngrowth, by encouraging private sector participation in providing\nwaste  management  services.  The  Project  will  also  help  to\nunderpin the development of tourism. It will serve the entire", "iii\nislands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\nObjectives and Scope : The  principal  objective  is  to  facilitate  sustainable  and\nappropriate  waste  management  practices  in  Rarotonga  and\nAitutaki. The Project will contribute to the achievement of the\nlonger  term  goals  of  safeguarding  public  health  and  the\nenvironment,  supporting  private-sector  participation  in  waste\nmanagement, and increasing public awareness of responsible\nwaste management practices. The Project combines the three\nprincipal thrusts of policy improvement, capacity building, and\ninvestment  in  physical  facilities.  The  project  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\nThe project outputs will include\n(i)      efficient  waste  management systems  in  Rarotonga  and\nAitutaki, through the construction of new disposal facilities\nfor solid wastes and septic tank sludge on each island;\n(ii)    an  institutionalized  recycling  program  in  Aitutaki,  to\ncomplement what is proposed in Rarotonga, and to reduce\nthe quantity of waste;\n(iii)    improved waste collection systems;\n(iv)   an improved institutional framework to allow contracting out\nof  waste management services;\n(v)     cost recovery systems; and\n(vi)    remediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\nThe Project\u2019s physical components include\n(i)      construction of a fully engineered, environmentally sound,\nlandfill site in Rarotonga;\n(ii)      construction of a similar landfill site in Aitutaki;\n(iii)    construction  of  septic  tank  sludge  treatment  lagoons\nadjacent to each landfill; and\n(iv)   supply of operating equipment for each landfill, and for\nrecycling waste materials in Aitutaki.\nCost Estimates : The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  as  $3.1  million\nequivalent, of which the foreign exchange costs amount to about\n$2.0 million equivalent (about 65 percent).", "iv\nFinancing Plan : In view of the small scale and vulnerability of the Cook Islands\neconomy,  it  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) finance 70 percent of the cost of the Project with a loan of\n$2.2 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The\nloan would cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $0.2\nmillion equivalent of the local currency costs. The remaining\n$0.9 million equivalent of local currency costs would be financed\nby the Government.\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost ($ million)\nExchange Currency Percentage\nADB 2.0 0.2 2.2 70\nGovernment 0.0 0.9 0.9 30\nTotal 2.0 1.1 3.1 100\nLoan  Amount  and : ADB\u2019s loan of SDR 1,695,000 ($2.2 million equivalent) from its\nTerms Special Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, including\na grace period of 8 years. Interest will be charged at the rate of\n1 percent per annum during the grace period, and at 1.5 percent\nper annum during the remainder of the amortization period.\nPeriod of Utilization : Until 28 February 2004\nImplementation : A project steering committee has been established. A project\nArrangements management unit has been established in the Ministry of Works\n(MOW).\nExecuting Agency : The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Ministry of\nFinance and Economic Management. MOW will implement the\nProject.\nProcurement : Goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Three principal contracts will be\nawarded under ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures. Small\npurchases of vehicles, computers, and office equipment will be\nmade by direct purchase procedures satisfactory to ADB, to\nensure compatibility with similar equipment already in use in the\nCook Islands.\nConsulting Services : Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  A  total  of  11\nperson-months  of  international,  and  30  person-months  of\ndomestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.    An  individual\ndomestic  consultant  will  assist  in  project  management.  An\nindividual  international  waste  systems  engineer  will  assist  in\ncapacity building in waste management.

The estimated population in Rarotonga\nin  2000  was  7,000  people,  or  about  2,570  households.  The\npopulation of Aitutaki was estimated to be 2,000 people in 1999,\nor  440  households.  There  are  around  550  nonresidential\nestablishments in Rarotonga, and around 60 in Aitutaki. The\nnonhousehold  sector  includes  institutional  buildings\n(Government  buildings,  schools,  and  hospitals),  hotels,\nrestaurants,  shops,  and  small  manufacturing  units.  About  10\npercent of the population of Rarotonga are regarded as poor;\nthe proportion of poor beneficiaries in Aitutaki is higher than that\nin Rarotonga.\nThe ultimate beneficiaries will be the economy or the community\nat large. Improved solid waste management services will be\nconducive  to  further  favorable  developments  in  the  tourism\nsector, which is the principal engine for local employment and\neconomic growth.", "iv", "vii", "iiiv", "I.  PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Cook Islands for the Waste Management Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands  first  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  an  integrated  urban  infrastructure  project  in  1993.  Project\npreparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided for a feasibility study that was completed in\n1995.a Early in 1996 however, ADB became aware that the Government was facing significant\neconomic and financial difficulties, and further processing of the proposed loan was deferred.\nADB  focused  its  operations  on  assisting  the  Government  in  planning  and  implementing\neconomic and fiscal reforms.\n3. Implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  program  has  progressed  well.  The\nGovernment adopted a program of privatization, asset sales, right-sizing of Government, and\nprivate sector-led growth that has stimulated the economy. In 1998, ADB assessed the debt\nservicing  capacity  of  the  Cook  Islands.  The  principal  finding  was  that  the  country\u2019s  fiscal\nresources were extremely limited, and that it would be necessary to restructure its high-cost\nloans and seek debt relief from major creditors. This recommendation provided the basis, in\nSeptember 1998, for a debt restructuring exercise involving four main bilateral sources: France,\nItaly, Nauru and New Zealand. The exercise resulted in major concessions, such as debt write-\noffs, lower interest rates, and extended maturities.\n4. ADB\u2019s most recent Country Economic Reportb has indicated that the country\u2019s economic\nprospects are the brightest that they have been in the past five years. However, the country\u2019s\ndebt servicing capacity, while improving, remains relatively weak. For this reason, it was the\nconsensus of the parties at the debt restructuring talks that further lending to the Cook Islands in\nthe medium term should be on concessional terms. This view is reflected in ADB\u2019s current\ngraduation policy.\n5. Early in 1998, the Government reaffirmed its request for assistance in developing basic\nurban infrastructure. In February 1999 ADB approved further project preparatory TA to the take\ninto account changes in demand and Government policies of privatization and asset sales. The\nTA, which is ongoing, includes a feasibility study for a proposed waste management project, a\nfeasibility  study  for  a  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation  project,  and  assistance  in\nimplementing policy and institutional reforms and in community education.c\n6. ADB\u2019s  1999  Country  Programming  Mission  discussed  with  the  Government  the\npackaging  of  urban  infrastructure  improvements.  The  Government  gave  priority  to  waste\nmanagement improvements, and ADB has programmed a loan for consideration in 2000. A loan\nFact-Finding  Mission  was  fielded  May  1999,  and  a  Preappraisal  Mission  was  fielded  in\nSeptember 1999. However, there were two changes of Government in the Cook Islands during\nthe latter part of 1999. It was not possible for the Preappraisal Mission to obtain from the\ngovernment of the day firm commitments on sector policies or on project implementation issues.\n                  \na  TA 2070-COO: Integrated Urban Infrastructure Project, for $455,000 approved on 15 March 1994.\nb  Country Economic Review, the Cook Islands, 2000.\nc  TA 3085-COO: Urban Infrastructure Project, for $750,000 approved on 6 October 1998.", "2\n7. A Tripartite Review Mission for a draft feasibility study for the proposed water supply and\nsanitation project was fielded in January 2000. The Mission discussed issues pertaining to the\nproposed Waste Management Project. However, the new Government was still, at that time,\nunable to make any commitments on policy and project implementation issues.\n8. In correspondence between April and June 2000, the Government advised ADB that it\nwas  ready  to  recommence  discussions  on  project-related  issues.    A  Consultation  Mission\nsubsequently approved as an Appraisal Mission was fielded on 3-13 July 2000.d The Mission\nheld discussions with the Prime Minister, senior officials, and other stakeholders and reached\nunderstanding on policy, institutional, and project implementation issues.  Subsequently, the\nGovernment and ADB became aware of public objections to the use of a key site identified for\nthe Project in Rarotonga. The Government instituted a special program of public consultations;\nan  alternative  site  has  been  chosen,  and  public  opinion  is  in  favor  of  starting  project\nimplementation as soon as practicable. The Project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. The Urban Development Context\n9. The Cook Islands comprises 15 small islands and atolls with a total land area of 244\nsquare kilometers (sq km) dispersed over an ocean area of 1.8 million sq km. The capital is at\nAvarua in Rarotonga, the largest island, which is only 6 km in diameter. The islands are\npredominantly coastal entities and because of their size, isolation, and vulnerability of their\necosystems, their biodiversity is among the most threatened in the world. Special attention is\nneeded to protect the environment and ensure that development is sustainable.\n10. In March 2000 the resident population of the Cook Islands was officially estimated to be\n14,700, indicating a decrease of 4,500 people since June 1996.  A high natural increase in\npopulation is offset by emigration to New Zealand and Australia. There is considerable internal\nmigration from the smaller islands to Rarotonga, where there is generally full employment. Since\nthe 1960s, Rarotonga\u2019s population has fluctuated between 7,000 and 11,500 people. Current\nGovernment statistics put the population at about 7,000, indicating a significant decline from\n11,225 people in 1996. The atoll of Aitutaki is the second most populous island group, with\nabout 2,000 people.\n11. The Government recognizes the country\u2019s narrow resource base and limitations for\nachieving  economies  of  scale.  Tourism  and  pearl  production  dominate  the  economy.  The\nenvironment is one of the country\u2019s major assets. The climate, topography, and offshore reefs\nand lagoons make the country a popular tourist destination \u2013 more than 70,000 people currently\nvisit the country every year. However, visible signs of increasing environmental pollution caused\nby lack of appropriate waste management arrangements will adversely affect tourism.\n12. Until 1996, solid waste management services were financed through the Government\u2019s\nannual  budgetary  allocation.  Water  supply  services  continue  to  be  funded  from  the\nGovernment\u2019s  annual  budgetary  allocations.e  Assets  have  deteriorated  due  to  deferred\nmaintenance, a situation that has been exacerbated by the Government\u2019s necessary budgetary\n                  \nd The Mission comprised E. Gordon Fox, Senior Project Implementation Specialist, who was assisted by consultants.\ne  Household charges for water supplies, on the basis of annual payments, were levied in the 1960s, but the system\nwas  subsequently abandoned.", "3\ncontrol measures.  Public utility services in Rarotonga have been provided by a number of\nagencies. The Ministry of Works (MOW) is responsible for water supply, while sewerage and\nliquid waste management services are currently left up to householders and private contractors.\nCurrently, the Environmental Service provides solid waste management services, a corporatized\npower authority supplies electricity, while a private company operates the telecommunication\nservices. In Aitutaki, the Aitutaki Island Council (AIC) provides water supply services.  Currently\nthere are no sewerage or solid waste management services except for the Black Pearl Hotel\nwhich has recently introduced a liquid waste treatment plant.\n2. Income Levels and Poverty\n13. Visible signs of poverty or destitution in the Cook Islands are few. Communities in\nRarotonga are better-off than communities in the outer islands. The population of Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki are scattered among several smaller villages and communities. In each community\nthere is a mix of income groups, and there is a strong tradition of mutual support among\nextended families. Nevertheless, there are low-income households that are vulnerable to rises\nin the cost of living. Other low-income groups are found among elderly people, single female\nheads of households, and immigrants from the outer islands who are working in low-paying jobs\nand have no family support. There is evidence that the recent economic and fiscal reforms have\nhad a considerable impact on the population.f\n14. In the 1998 Cook Islands Household Income and Expenditure Survey, about 10 percent\nof households in Rarotonga with a monthly income of less than $240 equivalent are considered\npoor. About 10 percent of households that have monthly incomes below $450 equivalent, but\nhigher than $240 equivalent, fall into the low-income category. Although survey data for Aitutaki\nare not yet available, general view is that the population there have relatively more households\nin the poor or low-income groups.\n3. Solid Waste Management Services\n15. The level of private sector participation in waste management in Rarotonga is already\nhigh. The Environment Service contracts out to a private contractor,g the collection of solid\nwastes from bins placed in public areas (roadsides, beaches, parks, and the like), and also the\ncollection of wastes from domestic premises. The service is financed from an environmental\nlevy that is included in the departure fee charged at Rarotonga\u2019s international airport.h A second\ncontractor operates a purely private venture; collecting solid wastes in truck-transported bins\nfrom commercial premises, and directly charges customers for the service. Both contractors\ntransport their collected solid wastes to an existing landfill at Nikao. The landowning family\noperates the Nikao site (which is leased to the Government). Its operation is financed in part by\nthe Government, and in part by tipping fees for wastes that are generated on commercial\npremises.  However,  its  operation  is  environmentally  unsound;  compaction  and  covering  of\nwastes are not carried out consistently, and the site has no built-in environmental protection\n                  \nf  The impacts of the reforms are documented in Cook Island Reforms to April 1997 - Social Impact Assessment,\nprepared for New Zealand Official Development Assistance by Croydon Consultants, and in Cook Islands Financial\nManagement and Economic Restructuring Program Review: Social Impact Assessment,  Alastair  Wilkinson,\nNovember 1998.\ng  The contract, which is subject to annual review and renewal, contains little in the way of performance criteria.\nh  Rarotonga has a resident population of about 7,000 people. However tourism, one of the country\u2019s major economic\nactivities, currently brings in more than 73,000 visitors each year. Much of the solid waste results from activities\nrelated to tourism. The Government feels that imposition of the environmental levy is a reasonable means of\nrecovering the cost of waste management services from visitors, as well as from local residents many of whom\ntravel internationally.", "4\nmeasures. Despite the environmentally unsound practice of waste burning, the site is filling\nrapidly.\n16. There  are  no  formal  waste  management  systems  in  the  other  islands;  informal\narrangements exist in several  islands. Island councils, which have been established on each\nisland, are responsible for administration. The Office of the Minister of Island Administration\n(OMIA) is the Government\u2019s coordinating agency for island affairs.\n17. Waste collection and disposal services in Aitutaki have diminished over a period of\nyears, to the point where no service is currently operating. The situation is much more serious\nthan in Rarotonga. Commercial establishments use pits or trenches, which they themselves dig\non vacant land for solid waste disposal. Several pits are close to the seashore and present a\nserious risk of polluting Aitutaki\u2019s lagoon. Households dump their wastes on any convenient\nopen ground. Waste burning, an environmentally unsound manner, is common practice in both\nRarotonga and Aitutaki.\n4. Community Participation\n18. There is evidence that the community is becoming increasingly conscious of the need for\nenvironmentally sound waste management practices. In Aitutaki, where there is no central\nwaste collection service, a number of households attempt to bury or burn their solid wastes.\nHowever, this activity is limited, and households are dumping wastes in unoccupied land that is\nlargely out of sight. Rarotonga has a number of community and private sector initiatives for\nenvironmental protection and recycling of solid wastes.\n(i)  The Rarotonga Environmental Awareness Programme (REAP), which started in\nJanuary 1998, provides containers in which the public may place aluminum\ncans.  Glass and plastic bottles were purchased and distributed throughout the\nisland by a group of concerned citizens to encourage recycling.\n(ii)  An initiative of the Catholic Church Committee for the Environment in crushing\naluminum cans and storing them for future recycling, and in fostering recycling\nactivities in the outer islands, was \u2013 on the death of its founder \u2013 adopted by\nCook Islands Can Crushers, which is a private company. Sorting and crushing\nare carried out in a building located in the former Ministry of Works depot.\n(iii)  Another private venture, Rarotonga Recycling, operated by Cook Islands Steel,\nalso crushes aluminum cans for recycling.\n(iv)  Glass crushing is carried out by another private company, Multicontractors Ltd.\nThere is limited use of crushed glass as a concrete aggregate.\n(v)  The  Taporoporoanga  Ipukarea  Society  was  established  as  an  all-volunteer,\nenvironmental nongovernment organization. It supported the Global Year of the\nCoral  Reef  program  in  1996  and  is  currently  involved  in  implementing\nenvironmental awareness programs. It has adopted a program for people to\nutilize biodegradable wrappings, rather than non degradable plastic bags.\n(vi)  Businesses  and  importers  established  a  Waste  Management  Steering\nCommittee in 1998. A number of importers initiated a Recycling Centre project.\nPrivate firms are now collaborating in a common recycling center, and a pilot\nrecycling project for household wastes has commenced. New Zealand Official\nDevelopment Assistance (NZODA) has earmarked funding. A pilot domestic\nwaste segregation project has commenced.", "5\n19. Other private business initiatives in recycling include\n(i) waste oil recovery system at the international oil company\u2019s central fuel depot;\n(ii) aluminum offcuts and cans recycling at the local aluminum and steel products\nmanufacturer, for export and resale; and\n(iii) limited recycling of bottles at the soft drinks factory.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n20. The Government recognizes that the national goal of enjoying the highest quality of life\nconsistent with its people\u2019s aspirations, and in harmony with their culture and environmenti can\nonly  be  attained  through  economic  growth.  Facilitation  of  private  sector-led  growth  and\ninvestment is a key task, and encouraging private sector participation is official Government\npolicy. The Government is looking toward an expanded role for private enterprises to become\n\u201cpartners and providers\u201d of infrastructure and services. Private sector participation offers greater\nefficiency, which is derived from management flexibility, freedom of action, greater financial\ndiscipline,  and  adherence  to  market  forces.  The  challenges  ahead  include  private  sector\nparticipation in managing the international airport, Rarotonga\u2019s harbor, electric power supplies,\nwater distribution, and waste management. The Government is concentrating on providing an\nenabling environment, the efficient use of resources, and safeguarding public welfare.\n21. A number of issues are being addressed to encourage private sector participation and\nprovide  improved  waste  management  services  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.    They  include\nimplementing  a  structure  that  will  continue  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  and\nencouraging community support for private sector involvement. In the outer islands, including\nAitutaki, the Government is planning to give greater autonomy to individual island councils.\nSeveral functions that were at one time the responsibility of the Ministry of Outer Islands\nDevelopment (MOID) are being transferred to island councils. MOID has been restructured and\nright-sized as OMIA.\n22. Under the Rarotonga Environment Act (1994 - 95), substantial fines can be imposed on\npeople or organizations found guilty of disposing of wastes in an environmentally unsound\nmanner, whether in a public place or on private land. The Government proposes that the\nEnvironment Service become a monitoring and regulatory agency, and assist environmental\ncommittees  that  are  to  be  established  in  the  outer  islands,  including  Aitutaki.  A  new\nEnvironment Bill was introduced in Parliament and is under consideration.\n23. The  Government  has  promoted  public  participation  in  planning  new  waste  disposal\nsystems, with assistance from ADB, and further public education and participation programs are\nbeing developed.  In Rarotonga the public is already accustomed to private sector participation\nin solid waste management and has expressed, through consultative processes, a clear desire\nto have the private sector continue providing waste management services.\n                  \ni  As defined at a national consultative retreat in November 1997.", "6\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n1. ADB\u2019s Assistance\n24. ADB  has  approved  11  loans  to  the  Cook  Islands.  None  were  specifically  for  the\ndevelopment of urban infrastructure, but two multiproject loansj have included infrastructure\ncomponents,  including  harbor  works,  wharves  and  rural  roads.  The  first  multiproject  loan\nincluded a drainage and flood control component in Rarotonga. The subproject was successfully\ncompleted and has stood the test of subsequent storm events. The second loan was to have\nincluded a sewerage system for Avarua. At that time, however, the Government was reluctant to\nenact a users-pay policy, which was a precondition of ADB financing. The sewerage component\nwas therefore deleted from the Second Multiproject.\n2. Other Assistance\n25. The Government has received assistance for developing urban services from several\nsources. Until the late 1980s, New Zealand was the principal contributor to water supply and\nsanitation development, particularly in Rarotonga. Assistance has also been received from\nAustralia, Britain, Canada, Germany, the United States of America, and other bilateral sources.\nMultilateral agencies that have provided assistance to the sector include the South Pacific\nCommunity,k United Nations Development Programme, World Health Organization, and the\nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund.  More  recently  the  French  Government  financed  the\nrehabilitation of water supplies and electrical power generation and distribution in Rarotonga.\nAustralia is financing water supply improvements in Aitutaki. In 1997/98 New Zealand provided\nassistance to cover the cost of machine hire and materials needed to replace water supply\ndistribution pipelines in Rarotonga. New Zealand is also assisting the Environment Service to\nrefine and implement its environmental impact assessment procedures; this project currently\nawaits  the  outcome  of  a  consultative  process  between  the  Environment  Service  and\nnongovernment environment groups. A list of external assistance to the sector is in Appendix 2.\n26. In its program for 2000/2001, NZODA has earmarked funds to provide a recycling facility\nin Rarotonga. This follows a private-sector led initiative for recycling used cans, glass, and other\nmaterials. This proposal will support and enhance the provision of waste management facilities\nin Rarotonga.\nD. Lessons Learned\n1. The ADB Experience\n27. Of the 10 loans approved by ADB, project completion reports have been prepared for\neight, and two have been postevaluated. Experience in several projects has indicated that\nproject management assistance, provided as an integral part of the project, has enhanced the\nexecuting agency\u2019s implementation capability. Such assistance has subsequently become an\nintegral part of ADB-financed operations in the Cook Islands.\n28. The two ADB-financed multiprojects included significant amounts of civil works. Delays\nin implementing the first Multiproject were caused by limited resources of the several small\n                  \nj  Loan 461-COO (SF) Multiproject, for $1.0 million, and Loan 849-COO (SF) Second Multiproject, for $2.75 million\napproved on 27 October 1987.\nk  Formerly known as the South Pacific Commission.", "7\nimplementing agencies. In retrospect it was felt that a reduced amount of construction work by\nthe (then) Public Works Department would have led to more rapid implementation. The Project\nCompletion Report (PCR) pointed to the need for more realistic implementation schedules, to\ntake into account the smallness of ADB\u2019s Pacific member countries, their limited resources, and\ntheir geographic remoteness. The Second Multiproject ran into more serious implementation\ndelays, particularly due to delayed release of the counterpart funds required to complete three\nsubprojects.  The  PCR  also  pointed  to  a  lack  of  direction  and  coordination  between  the\nexecuting  agency  and  the  implementing  agencies.  More  recently  the  PCR  for  the  ADB-\nsupported Economic Restructuring Program, which included a very significant downsizing of the\npublic  service,  indicated  that  lack  of  management  continuity  and  structural  changes  are\nimpeding service delivery and project implementation.\n2. Other Projects\n29. A French-financed water supply project that was completed in Rarotonga in the mid-\n1990s was not accompanied by proposed revenue-generating measures. The project would\nhave supplied and installed consumer water meters and would have introduced consumption-\nbased water charges. However, the particular meters to be provided were rejected by the (then)\nGovernment\u2019s Department of Water Supply as being difficult to read and maintain.  A cost\nrecovery system for water supplies has still not been introduced.\n3. Summary of Lessons Learned\na. Public Sector Reforms\n30. The willingness of the Government to tackle vitally needed economic and fiscal reforms\nunder its ADB-supported economic reform program has been notable. Government departments\nhave been downsized, and Government expenditure has been significantly reduced. Further\nassistance is required to ensure the maintenance of the reform process, particularly with regard\nto encouraging private sector-led growth and sustainability of appropriate levels of service.\nb. Revenue Generation\n31. The nonadoption of revenue-generating measures in urban infrastructure projects \u2013\nnotably in water supply developments \u2013 has resulted in poor sustainability and lies at the heart\nof problems of deferred maintenance.  The record is somewhat better in respect of other\nservices \u2013 notably electric power supplies in Rarotonga, which are operated on a commercial\nbasis \u2013 and the national telecommunications system, which has private sector participation. The\nprincipal lesson learned is to ensure that adequate revenue generation measures are built into\nthe project design.\nc. Project Implementation\n32. Delays in implementing ADB-financed projects up to 1996 illustrated the limited capacity\nof the executing and implementing agencies. The capacity limitations are due to a lack of\nprofessional expertise and paucity of professional staff. Timely release of counterpart finance\nhas also been a problem. Clearly, there needs to be greater emphasis on support during project\nimplementation.", "8\nd. Appropriate Technology\n33. Another lesson that has emerged relates to the selection of materials and equipment.\nThe country\u2019s climate, which is warm, with high humidity and seawater-laden winds, accelerates\nthe corrosion of mechanical, electrical, and other susceptible equipment. The country is a\nconsiderable distance from the nearest source of spare parts. While servicing skills for some\nfairly sophisticated equipment are available in Rarotonga, breakdown of critical components can\nput equipment out of service for considerable periods of time while replacement parts are\nlocated, ordered, and delivered. To minimize the need to carry large inventories of spare parts,\nwhich may be subject to deterioration in storage, technology should be robust and appropriate\nto the local environment.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n34. ADB\u2019s sector strategy fits within ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. ADB will continue to\nsupport,  and  help  to  reinforce  and  consolidate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s\neconomic reform program. In particular, ADB will support the achievement of macroeconomic\nstability; ensure structural reforms, with private sector-led economic recovery; and enhance\nequity and community participation. The maintenance of fiscal balance, restoration of business\nconfidence, and development of systems for sound financial and economic management are\nkey  policy  issues.  ADB  is  assisting  in  developing  urban  infrastructure  to  support  the\nGovernment\u2019s private sector-led growth strategy.  The development of urban infrastructure\nincludes  strong  emphasis  on  private  sector  participation,  and  on  appropriate  institutional\nframeworks that will enhance ADB\u2019s support of improved governance.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n35. Dialogue between the Government and ADB is continuing on several sector policy\nissues, particularly with regard to (i) establishing an appropriate institutional framework for\neffective  operation  of  waste  management  services,  (ii)  private  sector  and  community\nparticipation  in  providing  solid  waste  management  services  and  (iii)  cost  recovery.  The\ninstitutional framework will provide for performance, economic, and environmental regulation.\nThe dialogue is focusing in particular on issues pertaining to the sustainability of appropriate\nlevels of service and the reduction of direct Government involvement.  The Government is\nimplementing an Institutional and Policy Action Plan (Appendix 3).\n1. Institutional Framework\n36. The  Government  is  establishing,  with  ADB  assistance,l  the  following  institutional\nframework to ensure the sustainability of solid waste management facilities. In Rarotonga MOW\nwill be responsible for managing solid waste services. It will then contract out or franchise utility\nasset management and operations to the private sector and set performance targets.  In Aitutaki\nAICm will be responsible for waste management services.  It will contract out the operation of\nwaste management services to the private sector, and also set performance targets.\n                  \nl ADB\u2019s assistance is being provided through TA 3085-COO: Urban Infrastructure Project  (Footnote 3).\nm AIC is an elected body that has the power of passing and administering ordinances and bylaws, coordinating\neconomic and social development activities, assisting the Government in governance, and advising in disputes. It\nmay impose tolls, due fees and fines; control a number of activities, including waste disposal practices; and license\ninformal traders.", "9\n2. Private Sector Participation\n37. Several forms of private sector participation are appropriate in solid waste management.\n(i)  Contracting.    The  Government  awards  term  contracts  to  private  companies  to\nundertake one or more functions such as collecting waste or operating disposal sites;\n(ii)  Concessions.  The Government awards a concession to a private company to carry\nout a full waste management process that may include collection, recycling, and\ndisposal. The private firm builds the facility, operates it, and may transfer it to the\nGovernment after some years of operation.\n(iii)  Franchising. The Government awards an area monopoly to a private firm to deliver a\nsolid waste management service for a specific time period (the private firm recovers\nits cost and profit through user charges).\n(iv)  Open competition. The Government allows qualified private firms to compete for\nwaste management services. No firm holds an area monopoly and any number can\ncompete for the same area. The firms directly bill their customers.\n38. In Rarotonga, a contracting system is already in place and the public is accustomed to\nprivate sector participation in providing waste management services. The Government proposes\nto continue this form of private sector participation. In Aitutaki, where there is no solid waste\nmanagement  system  in  operation  at  present,  contracting  out  the  operation  of  solid  waste\nmanagement services is seen as the best option.\n3. Regulatory Framework\n39. The Government has proposed a regulatory framework for solid waste management\nservices on two islands.  In Rarotonga  (i) MOW will undertake performance regulation in\nmanaging the operating contracts; (ii) the MFEM in consultation with MOW, will review charges,\nfees, and expenditures;  (iii) the Environment Service will be responsible for waste management\npolicy and education and awareness; and (iv) the Environment Service will be responsible for\nenvironmental regulation.  In Aitutaki (i) AIC will undertake performance regulation in managing\nthe operating contracts;  (ii) MFEM, in consultation with AIC, will review charges, fees, and\nexpenditures; and (iii) the Environmental Committee, supported by the Environment Service, will\nbe responsible for environmental monitoring.\n4. Cost Recovery\n40. The key financial objectives are as follows:\n(i)  develop financially sustainable solid waste management services in Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki;\n(ii)  reduce Government\u2019s direct involvement in financing solid waste management\nservices;\n(iii)  improve the levels of cost recovery from users of public utilities; and\n(iv)  set charges that are affordable to lower income groups.\n41. A combination of four methods of cost recovery will be utilized:\n(i) continuing direct charges from commercial and other establishments;\n(ii) collecting direct charges or tipping fees at waste disposal sites for wastes from\npeople who transport wastes privately to the landfills;", "10\n(iii) continuing contributions from the environmental levy part of the departure tax at\nthe international airport, to ensure financial contributions from tourists; and\n(iv) introducing direct household charges to achieve full cost recovery, following a\nreview of the financial position of waste management services, one year after\ncompletion of the new waste management facilities.\n5. Community Participation\n42. Consultations with stakeholders, which commenced during the project feasibility study,\nare continuing. The public is becoming aware that user charges are likely to be introduced to\ncover the cost of urban services. This is a significant issue; the public, over a long period of\ntime,  has  come  to  regard  the  provision  of  basic  urban  services  as  being  \u201cfree.\u201d    Public\nconsultation and education programs have been incorporated into the Project, and will continue\nafter project implementation through the activities of the Environment Service, MOW, and AIC.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n43. Rarotonga\u2019s  present  waste  management  system  is  overloaded,  is  damaging  the\nenvironment, and presents health hazards. Storm water that runs off the existing waste disposal\nsites is polluting surface streams and groundwater.  The capacity of the present landfill is almost\nexhausted, despite recourse to the environmentally unsound practice of burning the wastes in\nsitu at the landfill. Aitutaki has no waste management facility at all, and wastes are being\ndumped or burned with no control.\n44. The principal thrust of the Project is to halt and reverse the environmental degradation\ncaused  by  inadequate  solid  waste  management  practices  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  The\nProject will also provide facilities that will significantly enhance public health protection. The\nfuture of tourism, which is one of the country\u2019s principal economic activities, depends to a large\nextent on the conservation of the country\u2019s natural environment.\n45. The Project will help the Government improve the efficiency of urban services through\ninstitutional reform, and will consolidate systems for recovering the costs of providing waste\nmanagement services. The Project will support the Government\u2019s policy of maximizing private\nsector-led growth, through a thrust toward private sector participation in providing solid waste\nmanagement services. The Project will also help to underpin the development of tourism. The\nproject will serve the entire island of Rarotonga and the atoll of Aitutaki.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n46. The principal objective of the Project is to facilitate sustainable and appropriate waste\nmanagement practices in Rarotonga and Aitutaki. The Project will contribute to the achievement\nof the longer term goals of safeguarding public health and the environment, supporting private-\nsector participation in waste management, and increasing public awareness of responsible\nwaste  management  practices.  The  Project  combines  the  three  principal  thrusts  of  policy\nimprovement, capacity building, and investment in physical facilities.", "11\n47. The project outputs will include\n(i)  efficient  waste  management  systems  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  through  the\nconstruction of new disposal facilities for solid wastes and septic tank sludge on\neach island;\n(ii) a recycling program institutionalized in Aitutaki to complement proposals in\nRarotonga, and  to reduce the quantity of waste;\n(iii) improved waste collection systems;\n(iv) an improved institutional framework to enable waste management services to be\ncontracted out;\n(v)  cost recovery systems; and\n(vi)  remediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\n48. The physical works include (i) construction of a fully engineered, environmentally sound\nlandfill site in Rarotonga; (ii) construction of a similar landfill site in Aitutaki; (iii) construction of\nseptic tank sludge treatment lagoons adjacent to each landfill; and (iv) supply of operating\nequipment  for  each  landfill,  and  for  recycling  waste  materials  in  Aitutaki.  The  services  of\nconsultants will be required to assist in project management, and to carry out detailed design\nservices, construction supervision, training in solid waste management, and in establishing\ntechnical  standards  for  operating  and  monitoring  solid  waste  management  facilities  and\nservices.\nC.  Technical Justification\n49. Immediate  improvements  to  waste  management  practices  are  required  in  both\nRarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  The  waste  stream  amounts  to  about  1,450  tons  each  year  in\nRarotonga, and about 200 tons each year in Aitutaki. Future waste generation will be influenced\nby population growth and tourism development, and it is possible that changes in lifestyle will\nlead to increased waste generation. It is also possible that current trends toward recovery and\nrecycling of waste materials will reduce the volume of waste generated per capita. Waste\nmanagement methods must therefore be reasonably flexible to meet possible future changes in\nthe nature and quantity of wastes.\n50. The following methodologies of waste disposal have been considered:\n(i) landfilling\u2013environmentally  controlled  disposal  of  wastes  within  a  specially\ncontrolled site;\n(ii)  Incineration\u2013burning wastes at high temperatures, in environmentally controlled\nconditions, to reduce their volume;\n(iii)  ocean dumping\u2013transporting wastes to sea for dumping in deep ocean waters;\n(iv)  \u201cwaste-to-energy\u201d systems\u2013heat from incineration is utilized to generate electric\npower; and\n(v) \u201clong  haul\u201d  methods\u2013wastes  are  transported  to  remote,  offshore,  disposal\nfacilities.\n51. Of the above, ocean dumping is environmentally unacceptable and would violate current\nlegislation in the Cook Islands. \u201cWaste-to-energy\u201d systems require larger waste streams than\nare generated in Rarotonga and Aitutaki. \u201cLong haul\u201d methods require a disposal site within the\nreception country and there is considerable social, environmental, legal, and political opposition\nto transporting wastes across international waters.", "12\n52. The options that have been included in a least cost analysis have therefore included\nincineration and landfilling. Analysis has indicated that landfilling is the most economic option,\nand its level of technology renders it the most suitable choice for the Cook Islands. Wastes will\nbe compacted and buried in a specially engineered site. The site will be lined with impervious\nmaterial,  and  the  compacted  wastes  will  be  covered  with  soil,  to  prevent  environmental\ncontamination. Leachaten control systems will be incorporated into landfill design.\n53. As an adjunct to landfilling, the segregation of waste materials at source, with recycling\nof materials such as cans and crushed glass to reduce the overall volume of the wastes, will\nsignificantly extend the life of the landfill. The Project will include equipment for crushing these\nwastes, and will incorporate a public education program to encourage the public to segregate\nwastes prior to collection.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n54. The total cost of the Project is estimated as $3.1 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is $2.0 million (about 65 percent), including $0.1 million for interest during\nconstruction on ADB\u2019s loan. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1.  Detailed cost\nestimates by component are in Appendix 4.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates ($ million)\nProject Component Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nA. Base Cost\n     1. Land Acquisition 0.0 0.2 0.2\n     2. Civil Works 0.9 0.4 1.3\n     3. Materials and Equipment 0.3 0.1 0.5\n     4.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan in an amount equivalent to Special Drawing\nRights 1,695,000 ($2.2 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources, to cover 70 percent\nof the project cost. The loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of approximately $2.0\nmillion equivalent, including the interest on ADB\u2019s loan during construction, and about $0.2\nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost.\n                  \nn  Leachate the contaminated water that flows from a landfill site, is caused by rainfall that percolates through the\ncompacted wastes.", "13\n56. The Government will finance the remaining $0.9 million equivalent (30 percent of cost of\nthe Project) not covered by ADB\u2019s loan, comprising the cost of land acquisition, taxes and\nduties, local salaries of counterpart staff, local office accommodation, and part of the cost of civil\nworks. ADB's loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will\nbe charged at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period, and 1.5 percent per\nannum during the remainder of the amortization period.  Table 2 summarizes the financing plan.\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Financing\nExchange Currency Cost Percentage\nADB 2.0 0.2 2.2 70\nGovernment 0.0 0.9 0.9 30\nTotal 2.0 1.1 3.1 100\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing and Implementing Agencies\n57. The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  MFEM,  which  will  act  in  conjunction  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s Aid Coordinating Committee (ACC). MOW will implement the Project. A steering\ncommittee (SC), which includes the Financial Secretary and the Secretary of MOW, has been\nestablished under the chairmanship of the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (who is\nthe chair of ACC) to oversee and coordinate all project activities. The SC will ensure appropriate\nliaison  among  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation.  The  private  sector,  traditional\nleaders, and the Environment Service are represented on the SC. The mayor of Aitutaki will\nrepresent  AIC.    A  subcommittee  of  SC,  comprising  the  Secretary  of  MOW,  the  Financial\nSecretary, and the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister \u2018s Office will oversee and coordinate all\nproject  activities,  and  ensure  appropriate  liaison  amongst  the  agencies  involved  in  project\nimplementation.\n58. A Project Management Unit (PMU) headed by a project manager, who is a member of\nMOW\u2019s staff, has been established in MOW. A local project management consultant and an\ninternational consultant waste systems engineer will assist the project manager. An engineering\nconsulting  team  that  will  carry  out  design,  procurement,  construction,  commissioning,  and\ntraining functions will report to the project manager. A small group of secretarial and support\nstaff will be included in the PMU. Further details of the project implementation arrangements,\ntogether with organization charts, are in Appendix 5.\n2. Operation and Maintenance\n59. In  Rarotonga,  MOW  will  manage  the  waste  management  assets.  MOW  will  award\ncontracts for waste collection services and managing the Rarotonga landfill site, after setting\nappropriate  performance  targets.  In  Aitutaki,  AIC  will  award  contracts  for  waste  collection\nservices  and  for  managing  the  landfill  site,  again  setting  appropriate  performance  targets.\nProject assets will be handed over to AIC at the conclusion of project implementation.\n60. MOW and AIC will undertake performance regulation through their roles in managing\ncontracts for waste collection and landfill management. As there is no expertise for operating\nsolid waste management systems in the Cook Islands, consultants engaged under the Urban\nInfrastructure  Project  (footnote  3)  have  assisted  in  building  MOW\u2019s  capacity  in  waste\nmanagement.  Consultants  engaged  under  the  Project  will  assist  in  preparing  waste", "14\nmanagement operating contracts, training landfill operators, and establishing appropriate waste\nmanagement practices and performance targets.\n61. In Rarotonga, the Environment Service will be responsible for environmental regulation.\nIn Aitutaki, a specially appointed environment committee, with assistance from the Environment\nService,  will  carry  out  environmental  monitoring  of  waste  management  operations.  Again,\nconsultants  engaged  under  the  Project  will  assist  in  developing  environmental  monitoring\nexpertise for waste management operations in both Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\n3. Community Participation\n62. Consultations with beneficiaries, which have been an important component of the project\nfeasibility study, will continue during and after project implementation. The public is becoming\naware that user charges are likely to be introduced to cover the cost of urban services. The\nGovernment will continue public consultation and education during project implementation, and\nwill continue doing so after project implementation through the activities of the district councils in\nRarotonga and AIC in Aitutaki.\n4. Procurement\n63. Goods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for\nProcurement. Two contracts will be awarded under ADB\u2019s international shopping (IS) procedure\nfor  constructing  new  solid  waste  landfills  in  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki.  These  contracts  are\nestimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  equivalent  and  $0.2  million  equivalent,  respectively.  A  third\ncontract, estimated to cost $0.4 million equivalent, for the supply of operating equipment for the\nlandfills,  including  waste  collection  vehicles,  compactors,  and  waste  presses,  will  also  be\nawarded under ADB\u2019s IS procedure.\n64. Utility  and  service  vehicles,  computers,  photocopiers,  and  office  equipment  will  be\nprocured by direct purchase procedures acceptable to ADB, to ensure compatibility with similar\nvehicles and equipment currently in local use. A light utility vehicle, computers, photocopier, and\noffice equipment will be utilized by the PMU during project implementation, and will be handed\nover for general use by MOW and AIC afterwards.\n65. For contracts under IS procedure (i) written invitations to bid, setting out the technical\nspecifications and terms and conditions of the contract, will be issued: (ii) a notice inviting bids\nwill be advertised in an English language newspaper; and (iii) procedures of public bid opening\nwill be adopted; only such publicly opened bids will be evaluated. Invitations to bid will be from\nmore than one eligible source country. ADB will review the tendering procedures after the award\nof contracts, but before disbursement is authorized. The proposed procurement packages are\nsummarized in Appendix 6.\n5. Capacity Building and Consulting Services\n66. Consulting services will be used to assist in project management, detailed design and\nconstruction supervision, and building local expertise in solid waste management. To enhance\nthe capacity of the Implementing Agency, an experienced domestic consultant will be engaged\nfor about 16 months to assist the project manager. This consultant will assist in the day-to-day\nrunning of the PMU, maintaining project records, preparing progress reports, and ensuring that\nproject  accounts  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB  and  the\nGovernment.", "15\n67. An international consultant waste systems engineer will be engaged for about three\nmonths to assist the project manager formulating technical and performance standards for\nincorporation  into  contracts  for  operating  waste  management  facilities,  and  in  developing\nstandard procedures for operating and monitoring landfills. The waste systems engineer will\nalso  assist  in  establishing  systems  of  identifying,  storing,  and  managing  intractable  and\nhazardous wastes; preparing remediation strategies for existing dump sites; and assessing the\nongoing pilot domestic waste segregation project.\n68. Engineering  services,  including  site  investigations,  survey,  detailed  design,  contract\ndocumentation and tender evaluation, and supervision require about 8 person-months of input\nfrom  international  consultants  and  14  person-months  from  domestic  consultants.  An\ninternational consulting firm, which will engage suitable domestic consultants, will provide these\nservices. The firm will provide the services of international specialists in civil works design,\nhydrology, and civil works construction supervision. Domestic consultants engaged by the firm\nwill support design and construction supervision, and will carry out topographic survey work.\nThe  firm  will  provide  local  waste  management  personnel  with  training,  appropriate  to  the\nfacilities developed under the Project.\n69. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are given in Appendix 7.\n6. Advance Action\n70. ADB has approved advance action and retroactive financing to expedite the recruitment\nof the domestic consultant who will assist the project manager.  A contract with the project\nmanagement consultant will be negotiated shortly. Contracts with other consultants will be\nentered  into  as  soon  as  the  loan  becomes  effective.  MOW  is  preparing  a  shortlist  of\ninternational  engineering  consulting  firms,  and  technical  proposals  will  be  requested  and\nevaluated, to enable consulting contracts to be entered into as soon as the loan becomes\neffective.\n7. Disbursements\n71. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook. ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures will be utilized for paying consultants, civil works\ncontractors, and supply of equipment.  Small items of services or equipment, valued at less than\n$50,000  equivalent,  will  be  reimbursed  through  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)\nprocedures.\n8. Imprest Fund\n72. An imprest fund account, in US dollars, will be established at a reputable commercial\nbank by MFEM for the exclusive use of the Project. On receipt and approval of an initial\nwithdrawal application, ADB will advance $100,000 to cover purchase of equipment and other\nexpenses  to  be  incurred  in  the  first  six  months  of  project  implementation.  As  eligible\nexpenditures are incurred and paid from the account, MFEM will request the replenishment of\nthe account, supported by the appropriate documentation. For items costing less than $50,000\nunder any one contract, SOE procedures may be utilized to replenish and liquidate the imprest\nfund account.", "16\n9. Midterm Review\n73. A  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  carried  out  after  detailed  design  has  been\ncompleted and major contracts have been awarded. The review is envisaged to take place\nabout eight months after loan effectiveness, although the exact timing of the review will be\ndetermined during the course of periodic reviews and consultation with the Government. The\nmidterm  review  will  (i)  critically  examine  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  Project,\nimplementation  procedures,  procurement,  project  performance  monitoring  activities,\nconsultants\u2019 performance, community participation activities, and implementation of policy and\ninstitutional  developments,  and  (ii)  formulate  measures  to  remedy  weaknesses  to  ensure\nachievement of project objectives.\n10. Land Acquisition\n74. For landfill sites, about 1.8 hectares (ha) is required in Rarotonga and about 1.0 ha in\nAitutaki.  The  sites  have  been  identified,  and  agreements  have  been  entered  into  with\nlandowners. The agreements will become effective when a new Environment Act, which will\nrestrict the dumping of wastes on other lands, has been enacted, and when the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental impact procedures have been complied with during detailed project design.\n11. Implementation Schedule\n75. It is proposed that the Project be completed over months. Detailed design is expected to\ncommence in November 2001, to permit the start of construction in Rarotonga in September\n2002. Construction in Aitutaki will commence in March 2003. The completion of all works and\ncommissioning are expected by August 2003. The proposed implementation schedule is in\nAppendix 8.\n12. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n76. MOW will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, and will have the\naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB.\nMOW will submit to ADB copies of the audited accounts and financial statements, together with\nthe report of the auditors, not later than nine months after the end of the fiscal year to which\nthey relate. The annual audit will include the audit of the Imprest Account and SOE and a\nseparate audit opinion on the use of the Imprest Account and SOE will be included in the annual\naudit report.\n77. MOW will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project implementation. Within\nthree months of the physical completion of the Project, MOW will provide ADB with a report on\nproject completion and the initial operation of the project facilities, including the project costs\nand compliance with the loan covenants.\n13. Project Performance Monitoring\n78. To ensure that the Project is managed efficiently and that its benefits are maximized, a\npreliminary project performance monitoring system (PPMS) has been developed. The Executing\nAgency and ADB will use the PPMS during project implementation. The PPMS is based on the\nmeasurable outputs and impacts identified in the project framework.\n79. Under the PPMS, MOW and AIC will collect records of waste volumes, cost recovery,\nand other factors set out in Appendix 9. The project benefits will be evaluated after completion.", "17\nThe  PPMS  will  assist  MOW  and  AIC  in  the  ongoing  monitoring  of  waste  management\noperations after completion of construction.\nG.  The Executing Agency\n80. MFEM, the Executing Agency, was established by the Ministry of Finance and Economic\nManagement Act (1995-96), and is charged with the administration of economic, fiscal, and\nfinancial management of the Government. In its role of managing and coordinating externally\nfinanced assistance programs, MFEM, in conjunction with the Aid Coordinating Committee, will\ncoordinate and direct the Project. MFEM has been the Executing Agency for several ADB-\nfinanced projects and TA operations, and is familiar with ADB\u2019s procedures and requirements.\n81. MOW, which will implement the Project, was originally established by the Ministry of\nSupportive Services Act (1974). Its functions made the Ministry the Government\u2019s construction,\nbuilding, and furniture-making arm; its water supply entity; the transport service for government\nvehicles; and its printing press. Over time its core functions have changed with the privatization\nof some services, the transfer of functions to others \u2013 particularly those for the outer islands \u2013\nand its amalgamation with other ministries of state. Its current establishment originates from two\nacts: the Public Service Act, 1995-96 including the Public Service (Identification of Departments)\nOrder 1996, and the Energy Act of 1998 that created the Energy Division within the Ministry.\n82. MOW has a total staff of 51 persons, and is headed by a Secretaryo who reports directly\nto the Minister. During implementation of the Government\u2019s economic and fiscal reforms, the\nMinistry was reduced by about 400 persons. While its aim is to become a regulatory agency for\npublic  works,  MOW  retains  some  engineering  functions  including  the  construction  and\nmaintenance of roads, bridges, and coastal protection works. It is also responsible for O&M of\nRarotonga\u2019s water supply system. Capital expenditure budget and operating budget in FY\n1998/99  were  about  $1.5  million  and  $1.0  million  equivalent,  respectively.  MOW  collects\nrevenues from services provided. Organization charts for MFEM and MOW are in Appendix 10.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Impacts\n83. The proposed locations of the new solid waste landfill sites in Rarotonga and Aitutaki\nhave been thoroughly assessed. In Rarotonga a three-stage process of site selection was\nadopted.    In  the  initial  phase,  documents  and  plans  were  reviewed  and  islandwide\nreconnaissance  was  carried  out.    A  total  of  23  potential  sites  were  identified;  each  was\nassessed and ranked on the basis of 21 factors for landfill development. The factors evaluated\nincluded effect on natural habitats, impact on watersheds, and loss of land use resource, as well\nas visual impact, shape, accessibility, and distance from populated areas. Land acquisition for\nthe top ranked sites was then assessed. Of all the evaluated sites, a site in a steep-sided,\nenclosed valley that has already been affected by quarrying best met both environmental and\nengineering requirements. Site selection in Aitutaki followed a similar screening process.\n84. Both sites had previously been subject to disturbance. The Rarotonga site has been\nsubstantially altered by quarry operations. Native forest has been removed; existing vegetation\nis limited to common grasses, bushes, and a few coconut palms. The Aitutaki site has also been\nsubject to disturbance; native forest has been cleared for agricultural development but the site is\nnot currently used for agricultural purposes.\n                  \no  The Secretary is a permanent Government official.", "18\n85. The operation of landfills and septic sludge treatment lagoons in both Rarotonga and\nAitutaki has the potential to pollute groundwater and surface water due to discharge of leachate\nand lagoon effluent. Both landfills will have two-layer lining systems, with a lining of synthetic\nmaterial overlying a layer of compacted clay. Both landfills will have leachate collection systems,\nand leachate will be recirculated through the landfills. The residual leachate will be treated in\nrecirculating sand filters, and the treated leachate will be disposed of in the ground through\nshallow underground irrigation systems. The sludge lagoons will also be lined, and effluent will\nbe treated and disposed of in the same manner as landfill leachate. In Rarotonga, the design\nincludes the rerouting of an intermittent drainage stream away from the landfill operations.\n86. Hilly  ridges  that  surround  the  Rarotonga  site  provide  natural  screening,  and  lush\nvegetation that surrounds the Aitutaki site provides a natural buffer to the site\u2019s use as a waste\nmanagement area. The nearest residential building to the Rarotonga site is a prison, which is\nabout 400 m from the site but shielded from it by a hillside; a hospital is also screened by a high\nhill. The nearest houses are about 800 m from the site. Capacity building in the operation,\nmonitoring, and management of landfills is included in the Project. The landfills will be operated\non a \u201ccell\u201d system, i.e. wastes are compacted and covered each day. This will provide the\nprimary protection system against potential nuisances that may stem from odors and insects.\nThe landfills will also be equipped with pipe systems for collecting and venting gases that will be\ngenerated by the decomposition of wastes. These gases, which contain a significant proportion\nof methane, often cause the persistent fires in landfills.\n87. Construction operations are likely to generate some transient environmental intrusions.\nConstruction practices that will minimize the danger of soil erosion and potential nuisances from\ndust and noise will be adopted even though the sites provide a high degree of screening from\nthese hazards. Road traffic densities will increase as a result of construction and operating\nactivities. The access road to the Rarotonga site will be diverted away from nearby houses.\nOtherwise, roads close to the site do not pass through significant settlements. Road traffic\ndensities will be monitored and regulated.\n88. With  the  proposed  standards  of  engineering  design  and  operation,  the  negative\nenvironmental impacts of the Project will be minimal and will be far outweighed by the Project\u2019s\nenvironmental  benefits.  An  IEE  was  carried  out  and  a  summary  initial  environmental\nexamination was prepared.\n2.  Social Analysis\n89. Consumer surveys and public consultation have featured prominently in the conceptual\ndesign of the Project. The Project will be of benefit to the entire population of the two most\npopulous islands in the Cook Islands group. It will also benefit the substantial numbers of\ntourists who visit the islands. Surveys and consultations covered about 10 percent of the\npopulation of each island; special consultative groups of consumers were established and\nconsulted on all facets of the Project.\n90. The  populations  of  both  islands  are  scattered  among  several  villages  and  small\ncommunities. Each community has a mix of income groups. As there are few immediately\nevident signs of poverty, it is difficult to identify distinct groups of low-income households.\nNevertheless, studies have shown that the recent economic and fiscal reforms have had a\nconsiderable impact on the population. There is also a strong tradition of mutual support within\nfamilies. However, some low-income groups are vulnerable, notably the elderly, who are left\nwith little support when younger family members leave to seek employment overseas; single", "19\nfemale heads of households; and immigrants from outer islands, who work in low-paying jobs\nand have no family support.\n91. Consultations  have  indicated  that  a  significant  proportion  of  the  general  public  are\nreasonably aware of solid waste management issues. Many residents of Rarotonga feel that the\ncurrent collection system meets their needs \u2013 solid wastes are collected once a week, but\npeople are not really aware of where the waste is taken. Most households have a waste bin of\nsome sort. Those that do not have a bin or receptacle share their neighbors\u2019. Recycling of\naluminum cans and glass bottles commenced on 7 April 2001 with plastics and papers to be\nreduced in the next phase. While casual dumping of wastes occurs, in localities where it is not\nreadily visible earlier public awareness programs have made some impact. Many people know\nof the potential benefits of waste reduction and recycling. The need to pay for essential public\nservices has limited acceptance.\n92. In Cook Islands society, women are involved in formal channels of consultation and in\ndeveloping their own voice. They are involved in traditional society structures as chiefs and\ncommunity leaders. Within households, there is no apparent division of labor over the matter of\ndealing with household solid wastes. Men, women, and children may carry wastes to the\ndisposal bin.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Project Beneficiaries\n93. The  project  beneficiaries  are  the  households  and  nonresidential  establishments  in\nRarotonga and Aitutaki, which generate solid wastes. In 1999 the estimated populations were\n7,000 people, or about 2,570 households in Rarotonga and 2,000 people, or 440 households in\nAitutaki. There are around 550 nonresidential establishments in Rarotonga, and around 60 in\nAitutaki.  The  nonhousehold  sector  includes  institutional  buildings  (including  Government\nbuildings, schools, and hospitals), hotels, restaurants, shops, and small manufacturing units.\n94. The ultimate beneficiaries will be the economy or community at large. Improved solid\nwaste management services will be conducive to further favorable developments in the tourism\nsector, which is the principal engine for local employment and economic growth.\n2.  Least Cost Analysis\n95. Economic  least  cost  analysis  was  carried  out  on  two  levels.  First,  the  overall\nmethodology of waste management was considered. Assessed techniques included disposal in\nenvironmentally sound, engineered landfills; environmentally controlled incineration; disposal of\nwastes in deep ocean waters; \u201cwaste to energy\u201d techniques; and transportation of wastes to an\noverseas location.  The last three methods are considered inappropriate, as they fall short of\nenvironmental standards or are impractical for the Project.\n96. The  second  step  in  analyzing  alternatives  considered  sanitary  landfill  and\nenvironmentally controlled incineration, which are the only two potentially usable alternatives for\nfuture solid waste disposal. Three alternative scenarios were compared for both Rarotonga and\nAitutaki:", "20\n(i) Scenario 1 \u2013 landfill for 30 years operation.\n(ii) Scenario 2 \u2013 landfill for 15 years operation, followed by a second stage of\ndevelopment for another 15 years.\n(iii) Scenario 3 \u2013 Incineration, for 30 years operation. This includes replacement of\nthe incinerator after 15 years.\n97. The financial costs of each alternative were converted to economic costs and then\ndiscounted at 12 percent per annum to estimate net present values. The results of the analysis\nare summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3: Comparison of Alternative Scenarios\nAlternative Present Value of Costs ($ million)\nRarotonga Aitutaki\nScenario 1: Landfill for 30 years operation 1.28 0.71\nScenario  2:  landfill  for  15  years  operation, 1.08 0.63\nfollowed by expansion for another 15 years\nScenario 3: Incineration 1.55 0.89\n98. Scenario  3,  incineration,  has  the  highest  present  value  of  costs  on  both  islands.\nComparing the landfill scenarios, scenario 2, with phased landfill development, has the lower\npresent value because a proportion of the expenditure is not needed until the second phase is\nrequired  in  15  years  time.  The  difference  between  scenarios  1  and  2  in  Aitutaki  is  small\nbecause the landfill is so small that there are \u201cdiseconomies\u201d of scale, and the cost of mobilizing\nfor the second phase almost overcomes the benefits of postponing expenditure.\n99. In comparing nonvalued factors, landfills have several advantages over incineration.\nThey have a relatively lower level of technology, and operationally are more appropriate than\nincineration in the Cook Islands. O&M of incineration would require expertise that is not locally\navailable. Socially, landfills would have less impact than incineration because landfilling is\nalready an accepted method of waste management. Consequently, sites for landfilling have\nbeen relatively easy to identify. As incineration is not well known, sites are difficult to identify\nand acquire.\n100. Scenario  2  is  economically  and  technically  the  best  option.  It  allows  flexibility  to\nincorporate advancements in waste management technology during the next 15 years. Phased\nlandfill construction was therefore adopted as the waste management method for the Project.\n3. Financial Analysis, Cost Recovery and Sustainability\n101. The Project aims at achieving financial sustainability  through  full  cost  recovery  and\naffordability. It is intended to recover the costs of O&M and debt servicing by 2003, and of\nO&M, depreciation, interest and a modest return on capital by 2004, through a combination of\nuser charges and an environmental tax levied on airport users. The financial analysis examines\nthe projected financial statements of the waste management operations, estimates the financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and assesses the ability and willingness of the consumers to pay.\n102.  Financial statements were projected for waste management operations on Rarotonga\nand on Aitutaki. Detailed financial projections up to the year 2012 were prepared for each\nproject component to assess the impact on the revenue and expenditure streams of each\nmanaging  entity.  The  projected  financial  statements  are  presented  in  current  prices.  Key", "21\nfinancial ratios relating to liquidity, gearing, debt service, and profitability were computed and\nshow acceptable results. Detailed financial projections and ratios are in Appendix 11.\n103. FIRRs were computed for both project components. The analysis was undertaken in\nconstant 1999 prices. Estimates of capital expenditures and O&M costs were phased according\nto  the  programmed  implementation  schedule.  The  financial  revenues  required  for  full  cost\nrecovery were estimated including domestic and commercial user charges, tipping fees, and a\nportion of the environmental levy. Assumptions underlying the FIRR analysis are detailed in\nAppendix 11 and the results summarized in Table 4.\nTable 4: Financial Internal Rates of Return\nItem Weighted Base Costs Revenues Revenues Costs Increased\nAverage Case  Increased Reduced Delayed  by 5% and\nCost of by 10%  by 10%  by One Revenues\nCapital Year  Reduced by 5%\nRarotonga (%) 0.4 3.6 1.6 1.3 2.5 1.5\n   Sensitivity    Indicator 5.7 6.3\nAitutaki (%) 0.4 2.0 0.1 -0.1 0.0 1.2\n  Sensitivity Indicator 9.3 10.3\nAssuming Government funds are raised at 6 percent per annum, the ADB loan carries a service charge of 1.5 percent\nper annum and inflation is 2.5 percent.\n104.  The base case FIRR is estimated at 2.9 percent for the Rarotonga landfill and 2.4\npercent for the Aitutaki landfill. These compare favorably with the weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC), estimated to be about 0.4 percent for both. Hence, no long-term subsidies will\nbe  involved  and  the  waste  management  services  will  be  sustainable  for  both  project\ncomponents. Conventional sensitivity tests show that the FIRR for both components is sensitive\nto significant changes in costs and revenues. Only in the most adverse scenarios for Aitutaki\ndoes the FIRR fall below the WACC; this is acceptable given the relatively higher costs and the\nlower revenue potential of Aitutaki\u2019s system.\n105. Revenues will come from five sources: (i) direct user charges from commercial and other\nnonhousehold establishments; (ii) contributions from the environmental levy, which is a portion\nof the airport departure tax from Rarotonga; (iii) tipping fees from the disposal of waste at the\nfacilities; (iv) charges for the dumping and treatment of septage; and (v) charges on households\nto be imposed from 2004 for the collection of solid wastes on Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\n106.  Based on 1999 data, the commercial sector and tourists generate 38 percent by weight\nof all solid wastes on Rarotonga and 23 percent on Aitutaki. Of this, tourists generate about 10\npercent of all solid wastes on Rarotonga and about 9 percent on Aitutaki. Since a significant part\nof  the  solid  waste  is  generated  either  directly  by  tourists  or  by  tourist  related  activities\n(commercial establishments), it is justifiable to let the tourist sector as a whole cross-subsidize\nwaste collection services provided to the household sector. Accordingly, waste collection and\ndisposal services will be provided to the tourist sector on a full cost recovery basis. The\nenvironment levy therefore will be increased with inflation. This revenue source effectively\ncross-subsidizes the services to the local population, particularly the poor and low-income\nhouseholds.\n107.  During the period from the present to 2004, tipping fees for commercial and domestic\nwastes will double in Rarotonga, and will be imposed in Aitutaki as necessary to cover waste\ndisposal site costs.  In addition, modest increases will be made in existing collection charges in", "22\nRarotonga, and a collection charge will be levied on commercial wastes in Aitutaki. In 2004, a\nnew collection charge for domestic wastes will be introduced and that will allow recovery of all\ncosts including a modest return on capital.\n108.  The proposed household charge of NZ$2.80 equivalent per monthp on Rarotonga and\nNZ$1.88 equivalent on Aitutaki in 2004 is affordable to most people. Households with monthly\nincomes at the 10th percentile level of income would pay 1.3 percent of monthly income on\nRarotonga and 1.2 percent on Aitutaki. Households with monthly incomes at the 20th percentile\nwould pay 0.7 percent of monthly income on Rarotonga and 0.6 percent on Aitutaki. If the\naffordability level were set at 2.0 percent of household income, then over 90 percent of all\nhouseholds would be able to pay the proposed user charges.\n109.  Socioeconomic surveys undertaken through focus group discussions on Rarotonga and\nAitutaki in 1999 show that people are willing to pay for solid waste management services.\nHouseholds on Aitutaki are prepared to pay an average of NZ$2.77 per week or about NZ$11\nper month. This is thought to be a conservative estimate and in reality is likely to be higher. The\ncurrent absence of a collection and disposal service on Aitutaki is causing some alarm among\nthe population and many are willing to pay for the introduction of the service. On Rarotonga,\nhouseholds are prepared to pay an average of NZ$1.48 equivalent per week or about NZ$6.11\nequivalent per month.  This too is thought to be a conservative estimate.\n110.  Results of the survey of tourists on Rarotonga indicate a general willingness to pay for\nsolid waste management through the environmental levy on the departure tax paid at the\nairport. None of the respondents disagreed with the imposition of the levy. For all services, most\npeople expressed a willingness to pay more. An average of $1.10 equivalent was found to be\nthe additional amount that people would be willing to pay; this is about the increase needed to\nensure that other programs could still be supported by the levy.\n4. Economic Analysis, Benefits, and Rate of Return\n111.   Economic  analysis  established  the  economic  rationale,  need,  and  demand  for  the\nProject;  assessed  the  impacts  of  alternatives;  and  analyzed  the  proposed  components.\nEconomic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated and compared with the economic\nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC)  for  each  component.  Project  components  were  also\nassessed in qualitative terms since nonvalued benefits are particularly important for this project.\nDetails are given in Appendix 12.\n112.  For both components a number of non-quantifiable benefits are important.  These\ninclude nonincremental resource savings, recycling and reuse, health benefits, visual impact,\nenvironmental protection, and the potential direct and indirect economic impact of environmental\ndegradation  on  the  tourism  industry.  Resource  savings  include  time  savings  and  costs  of\ntransportation for residents and enterprises that currently dispose of waste themselves.  This is\nimportant  for  Aitutaki  where  pits  are  dug,  filled,  and  then  covered.    Health  benefits  are\nassociated  mainly  with  pest  control  and  with  sanitation-related  illnesses.  For  Aitutaki,\nuncontrolled dumping creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other pests. The Project\nencourages the recycling and re-use of various elements of the waste stream. The proposed\ndensification of materials enables them to be re-used for other purposes, or saves volume,\nincreasing the life of the landfill. Residents, nonresidential establishments, and visitors both\n                  \np Base figures of NZ$6 equivalent for Rarotonga and NZ$4 equivalent  per month per household were computed. To\nassess affordability, value-added tax (VAT) at 12.5 percent was added to the base figures. However, it is\nrecommended that waste management services be exempt from VAT.", "23\nneed and demand the Project.  The findings of the discussion groups demonstrated effective\ndemand expressed as a willingness and ability to pay. The impacts of the Project are removing\nthe unsightly mounds of waste and preventing the pollution of groundwater, surface water, and\nair. Pollution of the lagoon may lead to the destruction of coral and other marine life. Protection\nof  the  environment  and  visual  cleanliness  are  prerequisites  for  safeguarding  the  tourism\nindustry, which is essential for economic survival.\n113.  Declines in tourism have been experienced in similar sites in Asia and the Pacific due to\nenvironmental degradation. Without the Project, the number of tourists visiting the Cook Islands\nwould likely decline or would increase at a reduced rate.\n114. The analysis of project components included calculating the EIRRq, which determines\nwhether the economic benefits outweigh the economic costs of the Project at the chosen\nEOCC.  The  analysis  included  sensitivity  tests  and  an  assessment  of  nonvalued  factors.\nNonvalued factors are important for environmental projects, given the difficulties of valuing\nbenefits. In calculating the EIRR, financial costs were converted to economic costs.  Costs were\nsplit  into  local  and  foreign  exchange  elements,  and  taxes  and  duties  were  excluded.\nConversion factors were applied to reflect the opportunity cost of the landr and the value of\nunskilled labors.  Economic costs were phased over the life of the Project, which is 20 years.\nReplacement values were included for material and equipment at appropriate years and a\nresidual value for the civil works component included at the end of the project life.\n115. The Project will benefit the residents and nonresidential establishments on Rarotonga\nand  Aitutaki.  For  both  islands,  the  economic  benefits  were  calculated  from  an  average\nwillingness  to  pay  (WTP)  based  on  questionnaires  completed  during  the  focus  discussion\ngroups and expected revenues from the nonhousehold sector.  For Rarotonga, net revenues\nfrom the additional recycling of aluminum cans, were also calculated. The WTP survey revealed\naverage willingness to pay around NZ$6.11 equivalent per household per month for Rarotonga\nand NZ$5.17 equivalent for Aitutaki. The expected revenues from the nonhousehold sector\ninclude a portion of the environmental levy on the airport departure tax, direct user charges, and\ntipping fees.  Expected revenues are detailed in Appendix 11.\n116. Table 2 summarizes the results of the EIRR analysis and the sensitivity tests at levels\nconsidered appropriate for the Project.  A delay in the benefit stream of one year is also\nconsidered.\nTable 2: Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nItem Base Costs Benefits Benefits Costs Increased by\nCase Increased Reduced Delayed by 10% and Benefits\nby 10% by 10% one year Reduced by 10%\nRarotonga (%) 14.2 11.5 11.2 10.9 8.6\nSensitivity Indicator 1.7 1.9\nSwitching Value (%) 16.0 14.0\nAitutaki (%) 12.9 10.2 9.9 9.8 7.4\nSensitivity Indicator 2.1 2.3\nSwitching Value (%) 11.0 10.0\n117.  For both Projects, the EIRR is higher than the EOCC, which, in accordance with ADB\nguidelines for projects with significant environmental benefits, is assumed to be 10 percent.  For\n                  \nq The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, and constant 2000 prices.\nr The value of the land in its next best alternative use.\ns Conversion factor for unskilled labor is taken to be 0.8.", "24\nRarotonga, the EIRR is percent. Only under the worst case sensitivity test does the EIRR fall\nbelow 10 percent.  Costs would have to increase by 16 percent and benefits would have to\ndecrease by 14 percent for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC.  For Aitutaki, the EIRR is 12.9\npercent.  Under a number of assumptions, the EIRR marginally falls below 10 percent. Where\ncosts increase and benefits decrease both by 10 percent, the EIRR is 7.4 percent. Costs would\nhave to increase by 11 percent and benefits would have to decrease by 10 percent for the EIRR\nto fall below the EOCC. As an alternative method to calculating the EIRR, which is based on\nidentified and valued benefits, the economic analysis also calculated the reduction in tourism\nthat would have to occur for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC.\nB. Environmental\n118. The Project will be of significant environmental benefit to the islands of Rarotonga and\nAitutaki. Improved waste management will reduce the risk of surface water and groundwater\npollution currently caused by landfill leachate. Air quality will be improved because wastes will\nno  longer  need  to  be  burned  under  uncontrolled  conditions;  smoke  emissions  will  be\nsignificantly reduced. Mitigation plans for the existing landfill site in Rarotonga will be developed.\nBy eliminating the need to dump wastes on vacant ground, the aesthetic improvements that will\nstem from the Project, will increase tourists\u2019 appreciation of the islands\u2019 environments, and will\nlead to continued economic benefits. Involving Environment Service staff in designing and\nimplementing  the  Project  will  improve  their  practical  knowledge  and  capacity  in  waste\nmanagement technology.\nC.  Poverty Impact\n119. All poor and low-income households in Rarotonga and Aitutaki are expected to benefit\nfrom the Project. About 10 percent of all households in Rarotonga are considered poor, and the\nproportion is higher in Aitutaki. To minimize the impact on their cost of living, the poor, destitute,\nand lower income households will not be required to pay charges based on the full average\nincremental cost of waste management services. The services will be subsidized under the cost\nrecovery arrangements proposed for the Project.\n120. Poor and low-income households in the project area will also indirectly benefit from\nsustained environmentally sound waste management services.  Such services are conducive to\nlong-term growth in tourism and the economy as a whole, favoring income-earning opportunities\nfor all, including the poor.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n121. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurance; which have been incorporated in the legal document:\n(i) The Government will ensure that, by 31 December 2001\n(a) a  new  Environment  Act  is  presented  to  Parliament,  with  provisions\nprohibiting dumping of solid waste on private land, and requiring disposal\nof solid wastes at the designated landfill sites and regular removal of\nsludge from septic tanks and disposal at the designated sites; and\n(b) necessary legislative change are introduced, and Cabinet directives are\nmade,  for  establishing  an  improved  institutional  framework  for  waste\nmanagement services  contracting out.", "25\n(ii) The Borrower will also ensure that by 31 August 2003\n(a) MOW will contract out waste management services in Rarotonga, and AIC\nwill contract out waste management services in Aitutaki, the relevant draft\ncontracts are forwarded to ADB for approval three months before they take\neffect, and such contracts include transparent bidding procedures and set\nout  appropriate  procedures  for  monitoring  the  performance  of  the\ncontractors;\n(b) taxes and fees are levied at the landfill site for waste disposal by the\nnonhousehold sector and by households that dispose of wastes directly at\nthe landfill sites;\n(c) the costs of O&M and debt service are recovered through taxes and fees\nfrom waste management services;\n(d) such taxes, fees, charges, and other expenditures are reviewed at regular\nintervals by MFEM and MOW in Rarotonga, and by MFEM and AIC, in\nAitutaki,  to ensure that they remain at appropriate levels;\n(e) the Ministry of Health assumes responsibility for public health monitoring,\nestablishes environmental health monitoring systems, and monitors and\nassesses public health impacts of waste management systems;\n(f) the  Environment  Service  assumes  responsibility  for  monitoring  and\nassessing  environmental  impacts  of  waste  management  systems  in\nRarotonga, and the Environmental Committee to be established by the\nBorrower  prior  to  31  August  2003  assumes  the  same  responsibility  in\nAitutaki;\n(g) the Environment Service assumes responsibility for formulating a waste\nmanagement  policy,  public  consultation,  and  awareness  programs  in\nRarotonga,  and  the  Environmental  Committee,  assumes  the  same\nresponsibilities in Aitutaki; and\n(h) the Environment Service prepares integrated waste management plans,\nincluding remediation strategies for existing waste disposal sites.\n(iii) The  Government  by  28  February  2004,  will  make  a  comprehensive  review  of  the\nfinancial position of the waste management services with a view to achieving full cost\nrecovery through introduction of user charges by 31 August 2004 to households for\nwaste collection and disposal services.

The  Waste  Management  Project  combines  the  three  principal  thrusts  of  policy\nimprovement, capacity building, and investment in physical facilities. The main thrusts of the\nAction Plan are\n\u2022  efficient, effective, and equitable provision of waste management services;\n\u2022  cost recovery through user charges for commercial users;\n\u2022  private sector participation, as appropriate;\n\u2022  community involvement and partnerships; and\n\u2022  environmental levy component of airport departure charges at Rarotonga airport.\n124. Actions required to establish the policy framework are in Table A3.1.  Measures for\nlaying the legal framework are in Table A3.2 and the broad institutional framework is in Table\n3.3. The policy and legal frameworks are valid for waste management services in Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki. The proposed institutional framework for cost recovery is in Table 3.4.\n125. Contracting out of waste management services will continue in Rarotonga, and will be\nintroduced in Aitutaki. Solid waste collection and disposal services for households in Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki will be financed from the environmental levy currently applied to departure fees at\nRarotonga airport. The Ministry of Works (MOW) will award the contract and will monitor the\ncontractors\u2019 performance. The contractor will collect tipping fees, which will be collected at the\nwaste management site, from users who take wastes directly to the waste management site,\nand fees from non-household users.\n126. In Aitutaki, the Aitutaki Island Council (AIC) will engage a private contractor for waste\ncollection and operation of the landfill site. Tariffs and charges from households and from the\nnonhousehold sector will be collected through the Aitutaki Power Board.\n127. In both Rarotonga and Aitutaki, charges for emptying sludge from septic tanks will be\nlevied by private contractors, who will pay tipping fees to the operators of the septage lagoons.", "Table A3.1: Policy Framework\nSequence of Reforms and Contents Action Required or Measures to Be By Whom Timing\nTaken\nPolicy Framework Preparation  of  memorandum  to Ministry of Works (MOW) and Ministry 31 July 2001\nCabinet of  Finance  and  Economic\nIdentifies  strategic  policy  objectives Management\nand principles and formulates a broad Approval of memorandum to Cabinet Cabinet 30 September 2001\nstrategy to achieve efficient delivery of Waste  management  strategy  to  be Environment Service January 2003\nwaste management services formulated\nTable A3.2: Legal Framework\nSequence of Actions Action Required or Measures to Be By Whom Timing\nTaken\nMemorandum (with reference to the Government 31 July 2001\ndraft Environment Act) to be prepared\nfor approval by Cabinet\nActs and laws needed to provide the\nlegal basis to put in place institutional New Environment Act to be introduced Crown Law Office to draft legislation 31 December 2001 3\nto Parliament, with provisions (in cooperation with the Environment 2\nstructures/arrangements  to  enforce\n\u2022  prohibiting the dumping of solid Service and MOW)\nrules and regulations\nwaste on private  land;\n\u2022  requiring  solid  wastes  to  be\ndisposed  of  at  the  designated\nlandfill sites;\n\u2022  requiring  regular  removal  of\nsludge  from  septic  tanks,  and\ndisposal at the designated sites.\nMake legislative changes (if any are Crown Law Office December 2001\nrequired) to enable MOW to manage\nwaste  disposal  assets  and  award\ncontracts  for  the  management  of\nwaste disposal systems A\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2", "Table A3.3: Institutional Framework\nSequence of Reforms Action required or Measures to Be Taken By Whom Timing\nMOW to manage and operate waste management assets in Government At project completion\nIdentifies institutions and provides for Rarotonga, and Aitutaki Island Council (AIC) to manage waste\nworkable  arrangements  to  ensure management assets in Aitutaki\neffective,  efficient,  and  equitable MOW and AIC to contract out waste management\nprovision of management services operations\n\u2022  Collection of solid wastes\n\u2022  Disposal of wastes at landfill sites\n\u2022  Maintaining and managing the landfill sites\n\u2022  Operating the waste crushing units\n\u2022  Operating the recycling unit\nMOW and AIC January 2003\nPreparation of contracts\n\u2022  Specifying terms of contract\n\u2022  Identifying performance targets as part of the contracts\nPreparation of transparent bidding procedures\nEvaluation and monitoring of operations performance\nMinistry of Health to be responsible for environmental health\nmonitoring to Department of Health 3\n3\n\u2022  Establish environmental health monitoring systems January 2003\n\u2022  Monitor and assess public health impacts\nIsland  councils  to  be  responsible  for  customer  relations District  councils  (with\nregarding waste management matters (handling complaints, expanded functions) January 2003\neducation / awareness of customers)\nEnvironment  Service  to  prepare  integrated  waste\nmanagement plans\n\u2022  Establish physical environmental monitoring service Environment Service January 2003\n\u2022  Monitor physical environmental impact\n\u2022  Prepare integrated waste management plan A\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n3", "Table 3.4: Cost Recovery Measures\nSequence of Reforms Action Required or Measures to Be Taken By Whom Timing\nMemorandum, setting out proposals for cost recovery, to be Government 31 July 2003\nIdentifies  cost  recovery  targets  to prepared for approval by Cabinet\nensure  sustainability  of  waste Coverage  of  interest,  depreciation,  and  operating  and Government 31 August 2003\nmanagement services maintenance costs.\n\u2022  Levy tipping fees for  nonhousehold wastes (Collection of tipping fees by\n\u2022  Levy tipping fees for disposal of household wastes that landfill operators)\nare taken directly to the landfill site\nCoverage of debt servicing costs, depreciation, operating Government 31 August 2004\nand maintenance costs, and return on capital.\n\u2022  Review  the  financial  position  of  waste  management\nservices by 28 February 2004, with a view to introducing\ncharges for the household sector in August 2004\n3\n4\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n3\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n4", "        35             Appendix 4\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES ($'000)\nForeign Local\nComponent Total\nExchange Currency\nRarotonga, Waste Management\nLand Acquisition -

Introduction\n1. The financial objectives of the Project are to: (i) create a waste collection and disposal\nsystem that is financially viable and sustainable and (ii) provide waste collection and disposal at\na price that is affordable to users.\n2. The project was analysed by examining the projected financial statements, calculating\nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and, average incremental financial cost (AIFC) for\neach component and assessing the affordability of the proposed charges.\n3. The basic premise for this analysis is that full cost recovery will be accomplished over\ntime. This stems from the agreement between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the\nGovernment of the Cook Islands on cost recovery targets:\nto  recover  debt  servicing  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  through\ncommercial charges, tipping fees for nonhousehold wastes and household waste taken\ndirectly to the landfill, and the environmental levy on the airport departure charge during\nthe first year of operation; and to cover of interest, depreciation, O&M costs and a\nreturn on capital through the introduction of user charges to the household sector from\nAugust 2004.\n1.  Rarotonga\n4. The Environment Service is currently responsible for public solid waste management on\nRarotonga through two contracts with private companies. Each is bid annually. The first is for\ndomestic garbage collection by a private contractor (T and M Heather) for a budgeted fee of\nNZ$110,400 for 2000/01. The second is for maintenance of the public disposal site and is\nbudgeted at NZ$50,400 for 2000/01. Waste is collected from households once a week, but no\ndirect  charges  are  imposed.  The  domestic  collector  also  provides  services  to  some  42\ncommercial establishments, emptying some 544 bins a month. Charges for this service are\nNZ$4 per bin.\n5. Other private businesses, including hotels and resorts, pay a private contractor (General\nTransport) directly to collect and dispose of solid waste. Every month some 70 bins (known as\n\u201crarobins\u201d)  serving  26  major  establishments  are  emptiedt.    Charges  for  this  service  are\nNZ$56.25 per load, including value-added tax (VAT), of which NZ$11.25 represents the current\ntipping fee at the Nikao site. The firm is also implementing another scheme that involves 120-\nliter wheeled bins, of which 22 operate at present. The charge for collection by bin is NZ$10 per\nweek.\n6. Some domestic waste disposal is undertaken unofficially in a quarry. However, the bulk\nis  dumped  along  with  collected  commercial  garbage  at  Nikao,  a  site  originally  built  as  a\nreservoir. The tip is operated by the landowners and functions as a private disposal site. The\nGovernment, through a contractor, pays for compacting of the site.  Charges levied on users\nare, about NZ$20 per truckload of commercial waste and NZ$5 for domestic waste.\n                  \nt   The largest generators are Edgewater Resort with 15 per month and Pacific Resort at 10 per month.", "    49     Appendix 11, page 2\n7. Funds for paying the domestic collection and landfill compaction contractors are from the\nenvironmental protection fund sourced by environmental levy of NZ$5 added on to the airport\npassenger departure charge. Budget estimates of these revenues for financial year 2000/01u\nare some NZ$332,000. The current domestic collection contract is budgeted at NZ$110,400 and\nthe landfill compaction at NZ$50,400 per year. Hence some NZ$160,800 will be financed from\nthe environmental levy for solid waste management. This is about 40 percent of the available\nfunds for 2000/01, representing some NZ$2.40 of the NZ$5 levy. Since no major new public\nlandfill site has been developed, there are no provisions to recover the capital investment costs\nassociated with the assets. No capital cost recovery is undertaken.\n8. In Rarotonga, septic tanks are pumped out only when they overflow and become a\nnuisance. Two contractors provide septic tank desludging services. Septic tank desludging\ncosts $80 for a household; hotels and industries are charged about $200. The price of septic\ntank desludging is high, and competition should bring it down. Septic tank sludge or septage is\ncurrently dumped on vacant land behind Vaimaanga Hotel, or on farmers\u2019 fields at the request\nof the farmer. No payment is made by either party.\n2.  Aitutaki\n9. In Aitutaki there is neither a rubbish collection service nor a disposal site. Residents and\nbusinesses dump their own garbage mainly in backyards or in semicommunal pits. The full cost\nof dumping is borne by households and businesses.\n10. There is no current system for septic tank desludging, and a vacuum tanker purchased\nfor  this  purpose  is  now  used  as  a  general-purpose  construction  tanker  on  the  island.\nDiscussions  with  the  Aitutaki  Island  Council  indicated  that  people  were  not  aware  of  the\nimportance of septage disposal and the need to desludge septic tanks. There is currently no\nplace to put septage, and landowners do not allow the discharge of septage onto fields.\nB. Financial Projections\n11. Indicative financial statements have been projected for management of the assets in\nRarotonga and on Aitutaki.  A computer financial simulation model was been developed for\neach operation. For each project component detailed financial projections were prepared to\nassess the impact on the revenue and expenditure streams of each managing entity.\n1.  Revenues\n12. With the objective of fully recovering the costs of the facilities and services over time, a\ncombination of five revenue sources is recommended.\n(i) direct charges or tipping fees at the landfill sites for collections from commercial\nestablishments and private trips based on volumes produced;\n(ii) direct  charges  for  commercial  and  other  establishments,  based  on  volumes\nproduced;\n                  \nu     Financial Secretary, July 2000.", "50 Appendix 11, page 3\n(iii) direct  charges  for  dumping  and  treatment  of  septage,  according  to  volumes\nproduced;\n(iv) contributions from the environmental levy sourced by collections from departing\nair passengers from Rarotonga; and\n(v)  direct household charges to be introduced in January 2004.\n13. The main assumptions used to compute the charges are summarized in Table A11.1.\n  Table A11.1: Key Assumptions in the Financial Analysis\nAssumption Rarotonga Aitutaki\nAirport environmental levy (held constant 2.50 2.50\nin real terms) (NZ$)\nNumber of departing air passengers in 61,600\nyear 2000\nAnnual growth rate of departing air 2\nPassengers (%)\nPercent of households that will be charged garbage 95 95\nfees from 2004 onward\nNumber of households in year 2001 2,621 462\nAnnual growth rate of households(%) 1.0 1.0\nNumber of commercial establishments/ 552  bins  plus  275 57 establishments\nbins to be covered by the collection establishments  currently\nservice, 2000 base figure not serviced\nAnnual growth in commercial bins/establishments (%) 1.25 0.5\nRarobins for disposal:\n\u2022  Number per month in year 2000 70\n\u2022  Annual increase in numbers (%) None Not applicable\nTrucks dumping commercial waste a/:\n\u2022  Number per month in year 2000 30 4\n\u2022  Annual increase (%) None 1\nOther vehicles dropping commercial\n waste b/: 20 2\n\u2022  Number per month, 2000 None 1\n\u2022  Annual increase (%)\nTrucks and other vehicles\ndomestic waste\n\u2022  Number per month, 2000 15 4\n\u2022  Annual increase (%) None 1\nPercentage coverage of septic tank cleaning service: Tipping of Septic  Sludge\n\u2022  2002 60\n\u2022  2005 40 80\n\u2022  2010 40 80\n\u2022  2015 70 80\n80\nCollection rate (percent of period debit) 95 95", "51 Appendix 11, page 4\n14. The proposals below demonstrate indicative charges that would need to be made to\nachieve full cost recovery over the medium term.  These are based on assumptions of waste\nvolume generated, population, and consumers set out above.  These charges are based on the\nprinciples of:\n(i) users pay, including households;\n(ii) promoting economic efficiency by minimizing cross-subsidies; and\n(iii)  affordability, particularly of household charges.\n15. The indicative charges in current prices for  households,  commercial  and  other\nestablishments, and tipping fees are shown in Table A11.2 for 2002 and 2004.  Thereafter, all\ncharges more assumed to increase in line with inflation annually.  The proposed charges\nassume that the environmental levy of NZ$5, which forms part of the airport departure charge,\nrepresents an additional contribution of tourists to environmental protection.  This is consistent\nwith the principle of users pay since the tourism industry contributes a high proportion of the\noverall waste stream.  If this source of revenue were not made available, then the charges to\ndomestic, commercial, and other establishments would need to increase substantially.\nTable A11.2:  Indicative Charges for Waste Management, Assuming Full Cost\nRecovery (NZ$)\nItem Rarotonga Aitutaki\nYear 2002 2004 2002 2004\nCollection Charges\nDomestic charge per residence a 0 6 0 6\nCommercial establishment charge b 9 /bin 10 /bin 25 30\nOther establishment charge c 30 50 Included above\nTipping fees\nCommercial waste, large load 40 50 30 35\nCommercial waste, small load 25 30 15 20\nDomestic waste, average load 15 20 11 15\nRarobins 25 30 na na\nSeptage sludge per tanker 50 55 40 45\na.It was assumed that household charges will be imposed from August 2004 onward and will gradually\nincrease over time  up to a maximum of NZ$16 per month on Rarotonga and NZ$12 per month on\nAitutaki.\nb.For some business properties in Rarotonga there will be no collection charges levied by the government\nsince they are served by private collectors under a number of arrangements. All private contractors will\nhave to dump rubbish at the landfill site and will be charged appropriate tipping fees.  This charge was\nbased on the number of commercial bins currently being emptied regularly by the household rubbish\ncollector. It is assumed that this collection service will continue and will be encouraged  to expand\ncoverage under the terms of the collection contract.  On Aitutaki this refers to the number of commercial\nestablishments and would represent an average charge.  Aitutaki Lagoon Resort will be charged more,\nbut this has not been detailed in the computations.\nc. Basic charge for commercial, industrial, and business premises not currently covered by public and\nprivate waste collection services on Rarotonga.", "52 Appendix 11, page 5\n16. For the long term, it is recommended that dependence on the environmental levy as a\nsource of revenue be reduced.  Over time, the major source of cost recovery should be through\ndirect user charges and the target should be full cost recovery through this source. But, to keep\nthe costs to households and businesses down and satisfy the objective of affordability, in the\nnear future major revenues should be from the special environmental levy. The extent to which\nthe shift toward direct user charges would be possible should be reviewed regularly in relation to\nactual household income levels.  This review should be the function of the Ministry of Finance\nand Economic Management, and any changes in the pricing structure should be submitted to an\neconomic regulator, who would have responsibility for approving price changes.\n17. The proposed charges exclude VAT, including it would increase the amounts by 12.5\npercent.  It is recommended that waste management charges be exempt from VAT, to keep the\ncosts to users to a minimum.\n3.  Projected Financial Statements\n18. Detailed indicative financial projections up to the year 2020 were prepared for each\nproject  component.  Projections  were  restricted  to  the  waste  management  operations  as\nproposed under the Project.  The projected financial statements are presented in current prices\nthat include inflation in each year.\na.  Rarotonga Solid Waste Management\n19.  Table A11.3 presents summary balance sheets, income statements, and sources and\napplications of funds for the waste management operations of Rarotonga up to the year 2012,\nwhen replacing vehicles and equipment first becomes necessary. Total assets are seen to\ngradually increase from NZ5.2 million in 2002 to NZ$5.8 million in 2012 as a result of growth in\nretained earnings from the operation. Sufficient cash is generated to be able to pay off all debt\nservice requirements and to purchase replacement vehicles and equipment in 2012. The current\nratio is adequate throughout the projected period from 2003.\n20. On the basis of the proposed charges, the operation will run at a profit from 2004 once\ndomestic charges are introduced. Net profits of NZ$7,000 will be realized in 2004 and this rises\nto NZ$249,000 in year 2012. Net income before interest yields a 0.2 percent annual return on\naverage capital employed in 2004 and 5.7 percent in 2012. Internal cash generation is more\nthan sufficient to service the ADB loan. Domestic charges contribute about 35 percent of the\ntotal revenue in 2004. This rises to 44 percent in 2012, countering the reduced importance of\nthe environmental levy, which is held constant in financial terms at its assumed 2004 level. The\nkey ratios show acceptable results.\nb.  Aitutaki Solid Waste Management\n21. Table A11.4 presents summary balance sheets, income statements, and sources and\napplications of funds for the solid waste management of the operation on Aitutaki up to the year\n2012 when replacing vehicles and equipment first becomes necessary. Total assets are seen to\ngradually increase from NZ$1.7 million in 2002 to NZ$2.0 million in 2012 as a result of growth in\nretained earnings from the operation. Sufficient cash is generated to be able to pay all debt\nservice requirements and to purchase replacement vehicles and equipment in 2012. The current\nratio is adequate throughout the projection period.", "53     Appendix 11, page 6\n22. On the basis of the proposed charges, the operation will run at a profit from 2004. Net\nprofits of NZ$21,000 will be realized in 2004, after the introduction of domestic user charges.\nThe amount is projected to increase to NZ$63,000 in 2012. Net income before interest yields a\n1.5 percent annual return on average capital employed in 2004 rising to a maximum of 4.1\npercent in 2011. Internal cash generation is more than sufficient to service the national debt.\nDomestic charges contribute some 14 percent of the total revenue in 2004 and rise to 23\npercent by 2012. The key ratios show acceptable results. Financial Internal Rates of Return and\naverage incremental financial cost.\nC. Financial Internal Rates of Return and Average Incremental Financial Cost\n1.  Financial Internal Rates of Return\n23. FIRRs were computed for both project components. The analysis was undertaken in\nconstant 2001 prices. Estimates of capital expenditures and O&M costs were phased according\nto the implementation schedule. Capital expenditures included those for (i)  land and land\nacquisition; (ii) land development comprising civil works, materials, detailed engineering design,\nand construction supervision;  (iii) vehicles and equipment; and (iv) project implementation\nassistance.\n24. Revenues were computed as domestic and commercial user charges, tipping fees, and\na portion of the environmental levy. Revenues from commercial charges were assumed to be\nrealized once the facilities are completed and operations to start in September 2002. Domestic\nrevenues commence in 2004. All revenues were computed in constant 2001 prices.\n25. Net revenues were computed and a base case FIRR was determined. Sensitivity tests\nwere carried out where (i) costs increase by 10 percent to reflect the adverse impact of a\nsubstantial depreciation of the New Zealand dollarv; (ii) revenues decrease by 10 percent; (iii)\nrevenues are delayed for one year; and (iv) costs increase by 5 percent and revenues decrease\nby 5 percent.  A 5 percent decrease in revenues was considered realistic since much of this is\nprojected to be from departing air passengers whose numbers are expected to increase.\n26.  Net revenues were computed and a base case FIRR was determined. Sensitivity tests\nwere carried out where (i) costs increase by 10 percent to reflect the adverse impact of a\nsubstantial depreciation of the New Zealand dollar;w (ii) revenues decrease by 10 percent; (iii)\nrevenues  are  delayed  for  one  year;  and  (iv)  costs  increased  by  5  percent  and  revenues\ndecrease by 5 percent. A 5 percent decrease in revenues was considered realistic since much\nof  this  is  projected  to  be  from  departing  air  passengers  whose  numbers  are  expected  to\nincrease.\n27.  Financial net present values were computed for each alternative by discounting the net\nrevenue stream at the rate of the WAC.\n                  \nw It is realistic to assume that 30 percent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar would be unlikely, given the recent\ndevaluation of the currency. A lower rate of 15 percent was imputed, which would increase the total costs by 9.4\npercent.", "    54 Appendix 11, page 7\n28. The results and detailed computations are in Tables A11.5 and A11.6 for the Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki components, respectively. The base case FIRR is estimated at 2.9 percent for the\nRarotonga component and 2.4 percent for the Aitutaki component. This compares favorably with\nthe WACC estimate of about 0.4 percent for Rarotonga and 0.5 percent for Aitutaki. Since no\nlong-term subsidies are involved, the waste management services will be sustainable for both\nproject components. Full costs recovery for land, land development, equipment and vehicles\nand O&M is targeted and is demonstrated to be achievable.\n29. Conventional sensitivity tests show that the FIRR for both components is sensitive to\nsignificant adverse changes in costs and revenues. In Rarotonga, the FIRR in all cases remains\nhigher than the WACC. In Aitutaki, the FIRR in the most adverse cases falls below the WACC.\nThis is because revenues were restricted to achieve a minimum return by limiting the domestic\nuser charge and maintaining the environmental level constant in financial terms. Nevertheless, it\nis considered unlikely that costs and revenues will both change by more than 5 percent, which\ngives further support to the sustainability of both project components.\n2.  Average Incremental Financial Cost (AIFC)\n30.  AIFCs were computed for both components and were compared with the average\nincremental financial revenue (AIFR) for each. The figures are indicative because the volumes\nrelate to solid waste management only, while the costs cover those for both the landfills and the\nseptage lagoons. Annual capital investment and operation costs, total revenues, and the volume\nof solid waste disposed were calculated for each year and discounted at the WACC. Table\nA11.7 shows that, for both components, the AIFR exceeds the AIFC. This shows that the\nrevenues are based on charges that would exceed incremental costs and realize positive\nreturns.\nTable A11.7: Average Incremental Financial Costs (NZ$ per ton)\nComponent AIFC AIFR\nRarotonga Waste Management 407 458\nAitutaki Waste Management 1,092 1,210\nD. Willingness and Ability to Pay\n1.  Impact\n31.   A  major  concern  relates  to  the  ability  of  customers  to  pay  charges  for  waste\nmanagement.  The adoption of a domestic users-pay approach in 2004 and full cost recovery of\nthe capital and operating costs incurred means that households will have to pay NZ$8 per\nmonth in Rarotonga and NZ$6 per month in Aitutaki in 2004. The charges will rise to NZ$16 per\nmonth and NZ$12 per month, respectively, by 2112 and 2116 assuming an increase of NZ$1.0\neach year for Rarotonga, and NZ$0.75 each year for Aitutaki. The introduction of user charges\nto partially cover the costs of waste management will have a minimal impact the budgets of the\nhouseholds.", "55             Appendix 11 page 8\n2.  Socioeconomic Surveys\n32.  The socioeconomic household surveyx undertaken for the previous ADB-funded TA\ncontained questions regarding families willingness and preferred method of paying for public\nutilities. Of 109 respondents, representing 4.9 percent of the total households on Rarotonga,\nsome forty-four, or 43 percent, of 103 respondents supported paying for solid waste programs.\nForty-eight, or 81 percent of 59 respondents, thought the Government should accommodate the\ncost of the collection and disposal of garbage. Although not an overwhelming support for paying\nfor services, a significant minority did support the concept. The preferred means of paying for\nsolid waste management are shown in Table A11.8.  The highest proportion opted for user\ncharges as opposed to taxation.\nTable A11.8: Preferred Means of Payment for Solid Waste Public Utilities\nMethod Number Percentage\nOwn Maintenance 5 8\nOne-off Payment/Connection Fee 8 12\nUser Charges 30 46\nTaxation 22 34\n                   Total 65 100\nSource: Economic Households Survey, January 1995.\n33. The  results  of  the  survey  were supplemented  by  opinions  received  through\nmany  public  meetings  and  discussions  with concerned  private  individuals  and\norganizations. A general consensus is emerging of the inevitability of paying directly for public\nutilities and many accept the need for introducing users-pay concepts, provided services are\nimproved and maintained. Most people now see charging as unavoidable in the near future and\nwould be willing to pay.\n34.  More recent socioeconomic surveys, undertaken by consultantsy in 1999, through focus\ngroup discussions in Rarotonga and Aitutaki show that people are willing to pay for waste\nmanagement services. In Rarotonga, households are prepared to pay an average of NZ$3.14\nper week or NZ$13 per month.  This too is thought to be a conservative estimate.  Residents\nindicated concern about future solid waste management and the environment, although many\nrespondents were not aware that the present disposal sites are inadequate.  Only a small\nnumber of residents were not willing to pay. In Aitutaki, households are prepared to pay an\naverage of NZ$2.77 per week or NZ$11 per month. This is also thought to be a conservative\nestimate. The current absence of a collection and disposal service in Aitutaki is causing some\nalarm among the population and many are willing to pay for the introduction of the service.\n35.  A 1999 survey by consultants of a sample of tourists on Rarotonga indicates a general\nwillingness to pay for solid waste management through the environmental levy as part of the\nairport departure tax. Not one of about 60 respondents disagreed with the imposition of the levy.\nFor all services, most people expressed a willingness to pay more. An average of NZ$4 was\nfound to be the additional amount that people would be willing to pay.\n                  \nx   Economic Households Survey, Cook Islands Statistics Office, Ministry of Economic Development and Planning,\nJanuary 1995.\ny  engaged under TA No.3085-COO.", "56       Appendix 11, page 9\n3. Affordability of Household Charges\n36.  A key financial objective of the proposed Project is to improve cost recovery from waste\ngenerators by establishing an appropriate framework for recovering costs. Based on 1999 data,\nthe  commercial  sector  and  tourists  generate  38  percent  by  weight  of  all  solid  wastes  in\nRarotonga and 23 percent in Aitutaki. Direct solid waste generation by tourists is estimated to\nbe about 10 percent of all solid waste for Rarotonga and about 9 percent for Aitutaki. Since a\nsignificant part of the solid waste is generated either directly by tourists or by tourist-related\nactivities (commercial establishments), it is justifiable to let the tourist sector as a whole cross-\nsubsidize  waste  collection  services  provided  to  the  household  sector.  Therefore,  waste\ncollection services will be provided to the tourist sector on a full cost recovery basis. The\nenvironmental levy, which supports about 17 percent of total cost recovery on Rarotonga and 65\npercent on Aitutaki, effectively cross-subsidizes the services to the local population, particularly\nthe poor and low income households.\n37.  Table A11.9 shows that the proposed household charge of NZ$8 net of VAT per month\nin Rarotonga and NZ$6 net of VAT in Aitutaki in 2004 is affordable to most households.\nHouseholds with monthly incomes at the 10th percentile income would pay 1.7 percent of\nmonthly income in Rarotonga and 1.7 percent in Aitutaki. Households with monthly incomes at\nthe 20th percentile would pay 0.9 percent of monthly income in Rarotonga and 0.9 percent in\nAitutaki. If the affordability level were set at 2.0 percent of household income, then over 90\npercent of all households would be able to pay the proposed user charges.\n38.   Increasing  the  charges  over  time  is  not  detrimental  to  affordability  overall  and\nhouseholds at the 10th percentile income would pay 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent of income in\n2012 for waste management in Rarotonga and Aitutaki respectively.\nTable A11.9: Affordability of Household Charges\n        Rarotonga    Aitutaki\nMonthly Monthly\nHousehold Charges Household charges\nHousehold Household\nas a Percentage as a percentage\nPercentile Income, income,\nof Household of household\n2000 2000\n Incomesb incomesb\nNZ$a NZ$c\n2004 2012 2004 2012\n10   420 1.7 2.9 320 1.7 2.8\n20   800 0.9 1.5 600 0.9 1.5\n30 1,090 0.7 1.1 820 0.7 1.1\n40 1,380 0.5 0.9 1,040 0.5 0.9\n50 1,700 0.4 0.7 1,280 0.4 0.7\n60 2,200 0.3 0.5 1,650 0.3 0.5\n70 2,920 0.3 0.4 2,190 0.3 0.4\nSource: Consultants, and income data from the Cook Islands Household Income and Expenditure Survey,\n1998, Statistics Office, Rarotonga.\na. \nWith about 4 percent economic growth achieved in 1999 and a further forecast of 4 percent for 2000, the\ndistribution and income levels for 2000 were assumed to increase at 2 percent per annum, half the rate of\neconomic growth. This is a conservative estimate.\nb. \nProposed household charges are shown as a proportion of monthly household income, in constant 2000\nprices for years 2004 and 2012.\nc. \nAssumed to be 75 percent that of Rarotonga.", "      57       Appendix 11, page 10\n39.  For households that are considered destitute, it is recommended that an approach\nsimilar to that for electricity be adopted for waste management. Under that arrangement bills are\npaid by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n40.  Over the longer term, charges are to be kept constant in real terms and are almost\ncertain to fall as a percentage of household income. Disposable incomes are likely to increase\nas a result of national economic growth, which is forecast to be 4 percent per annum over the\nnext few years.\n4. Airport Departure Levy\n41.  The total amount required from the airport departure levy has been estimated to be\nNZ$5.00, comprising NZ$2.50 for Aitutaki and NZ$2.50 for Rarotonga. This is an increase over\nthe amount currently estimated to be allocated, where some $2.25 of the $5.00 levy is used to\nfund  the  cost  of  operating  the  solid  waste  management  service.  This  environmental  levy\nsupports  a  fund  designed  to  finance  the  Environment  Service  and  specific  environmental\nprojects.    However,  the  Environment  Service  is  now  funded  mainly  through  Government\nbudgetary  appropriations  and  the  environmental  levy  is  to  support  environmental  projects,\nincluding waste management.\n42.  Projections made have maintained the amount to be financed from the environmental\nlevy constant in current prices at NZ$5. The assumption is to use the whole NZ$5 currently\ncharged for each departing passenger. To retain funds for other environmental projects, the levy\ncould be increased to say NZ$7.50 or NZ$8.00. This is well within the additional NZ$4 that\ntourists were found to be willing to pay.\n5. Summary\n43.  Significantly, the adoption of the proposed charges, including the allocation of the\nenvironmental levy, would achieve full cost recovery over the life of the project. The operation of\nthe facilities is financially viable and therefore sustainable. However, the projections made\nassumed debt service at cost with no allowance given for either foreign exchange risk or a loan\nguarantee. Nevertheless, positive returns are projected under the principles recommended for\nrecovery, and sufficient reserves could be built up to cover any major foreign exchange risk.\nThis does assume that domestic user charges will be introduced and maintained on both islands\nfrom January 2004.\n44.  The proposed household charges were estimated on the basis of overall revenues\nrequired,  including  the  proposed  funds  available  from  the  environmental  levy,  and  the\naffordability of business and household charges.  Under the full cost recovery scenario, charges\nare considered affordable to households representing about less than 2 percent of monthly\nincome for the 10 percent of households considered poor.  The charges are much less than the\naverage willingness to pay, as determined from the survey undertaken during the TA.  Destitute\nindividuals will be helped through an arrangement similar to that currently in place for electricity.", "Table A11.3: Rarotonga Landfill and Septage Sludge Treatment Facility Projected

Introduction\n1. The  environment  of  Rarotonga  and Aitutaki  is  one  of  their  natural  assets  and\ntourism, together with agriculture and financial services, is one of the main economic earners.\nImproved waste management services are necessary to protect the environment from damage\nand to sustain the tourism industry, which is necessary for economic survival.\n2. The economic analysis (i) establishes the economic rationale and the without-project\noption;  (ii)  establishes  the  need  and  estimates  the  demand  for  the  Project;  (iii)  assesses\nalternatives to determine the most cost- effective option; (iv) undertakes a detailed analysis of\nthe proposed components, calculating economic internal rates of return (EIRR), conducting\nsensitivity analysis, and assessing the project that cannot be valued; and (v) benefits addresses\nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB)\u2019s new objective of poverty reduction and examines how\nthe Project will assist in reducing poverty.\n1.  Economic Rationale\n3. Rarotonga and Aitutaki require immediate improvements in waste management.  Both\nislands need a controlled, environmentally safe method of disposing of solid waste, which will be\nprovided by the engineered landfill, and of septic tank sludge, which will be provided by the\nseptage lagoons.\n4. In Rarotonga, residents consider the current rubbish collection system to be reasonably\neffective, although improvement is required particularly for bulky waste including car bodies and\nwhite goods. There is a septic tank cleaning service provided by the private sector. Although\nsludge is dumped in the bush, and away from homes, there is no environmentally safe disposal\nsystem.\n5. In Aitutaki, there is neither a centralized collection system for solid waste nor a septic\ntank cleaning service. The problem of uncontrolled waste disposal is visible and is a major\nconcern to residents.\n2.  The Without-Project Situation\n6. The  without-project  option  for  both  islands  will  result  in  serious  problems  of\nenvironmental degradation. This is relatively unnoticed at present but will become more serious\nin the longer term.  Furthermore, the unsightly appearance of waste is an important feature of\nthe without-project option.  Avoiding this is critical from both environmental and economic views.\nThe islands depend heavily on tourism, which will suffer, if their visual beauty is impaired and\nthe environment is left to degenerate.  Protecting the tourism industry is essential for economic\nsurvival.  The Project can therefore be considered as a prerequisite for economic growth.\nWithout the Project, if the tourism industry declines, many households could be left without a\nsource of income.", "63         Appendix 12, page 2\nB. Need and Demand\n1.  Need\n7. There is both a need and a demand for the Project, from residents, nonresidential\nestablishments, and visitors.  Discussion groups during the technical assistance (TA) revealed\nthat  residents  were  concerned  about  the  environment.  They  considered  environmental\nprotection  an  important  priority  for  their  quality  of  life.  In  particular,  discussions  with  the\ncommercial and particularly the tourism-related sector revealed concerns for the environment\nand for the physical cleanliness of the islands to sustain the tourist industry.\n2.  Demand\n8. The projected demand for future waste disposal was based on the estimated waste\ngenerated by residences, nonresidential including commercial and institutional establishments,\nand tourists. The projections were based on an assessment of recent trends, current conditions,\nand future economic policy. In accordance with the per capita generation rates calculated in the\nwaste  stream  analysis,  three  forecasts  were  generated  for  each  island,  covering  resident\npopulation, commercial establishments, and tourist nights or tourist night equivalents.\n9. Demand forecasts generated in this analysis are not intended to be used as population,\ncommerce, or tourism forecasts per se.  They were made to provide one of the inputs to\nforecast the volume of waste generated and to determine the appropriate size of the required\nlandfill.  However, the risk associated with demand forecasts is that the landfill either will outlast\nthe intended design life if projections are too high, or with not last as long as the intended\ndesign life if projections are too low.  Therefore, cautious but reasonably optimistic assumptions\nwere used.\n10.\n(i) For 1999, the annual waste generation rates were 0.09 ton per resident, 0.76 ton\nper establishment, and 0.0004 ton per tourist night.  This rate was assumed to\nremain constant.\n(ii) For 1999, of the total waste volume generated, 62 percent was household waste,\n28 percent was nonhousehold waste and 10 percent was tourist waste.\n(iii) Population would increase at 1 percent per annum.  However, given the ease of\naccess to New Zealand, changes in the economy can lead to sharp increases or\ndecreases in the population. This makes any forecast of population difficult. The\nlong-term average growth rate over the last 30 years is neutral.  The proportion\nof the total Cook Islands population living in Rarotonga has increased from 40\npercent to around 60 percent, although the rate of change has slowed in recent\nyears.  The assumption of 1 percent per annum growth is consistent with the\nassumed  economic  recovery  and  moderate  long-term  economic  growth\nprojections for the Cook Islands.\n(iv)  The number of commercial establishments would increase at 1.5 percent per\nannum. This is consistent with the assumed economic recovery and expansion of\nthe private sector, some spare capacity in the economy, and assumed increases\nin tourist arrivals.\n(v) Tourist arrivals may be assumed to increase at 5 percent per annum until 2002,\nin line with Government forecasts and then at a more moderate rate of 2 percent\nper annum.  This is consistent with trends in tourist arrivals, which have shown\nan  average  growth  of  around  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  last  10  years.", "64 Appendix 12, page 3\nTourist length of stay was assumed to remain constant at an average of seven\ndaysz.\n11. For Aitutaki, the key assumptions were the following:\n(i) For 1999, the annual waste generation rates were 0.054 ton per resident, 0.38\nton per establishment, and 0.0004 ton per tourist night.  This rate was assumed\nto remain constant over time.\n(ii) For 1999, of the total waste volume generated, 76 percent was household waste,\n15 percent was nonhousehold waste and 9 percent was tourist waste.\n(iii) Population would increase at 1 percent per annum, in line with forecasts for\nRarotonga and the Cook Islands. The assumption of 1 percent per annum is\nconsistent  with  the  assumed  economic  recovery  and  moderate  long-term\neconomic growth projections for the Cook Islands.\n(iv) The number of commercial establishments would increase at 0.5 percent per\nannum.  This is consistent with the assumed economic recovery and expansion\nof  the  private  sector,  some  spare  capacity  in  the  economy  and  assumed\nincreases in population and in tourist arrivals.\n(v) The number of tourist nightsaa assumed that of the planned hotel developments,\nonly one the Rapae, will take place.\n(vi)  By  the  year  2021,  of  the  total  waste  stream  generated,  76  percent  would\nhousehold  waste,  12  percent,  non-household  waste,  and  12  percent,  tourist\nwaste.\n12. The generated waste volumes were converted to in-place volumes in the landfill to\ndetermine the appropriate size and potential design life of the facility.\n13. For septage treatment, the size of the facility was based on average septage production\nlevels per person. Facilities are sized to accommodate 450 cubic meters per year on Rarotonga\nand 200 cubic meters per year on Aitutaki.\nC. Least Cost Analysis\n14. Project alternatives were considered at the prefeasibility stage and a detailed least cost\nanalysis  was  undertaken.    The  analysis  focused  on  the  options  for  solid  waste  disposal,\ncommensurate with the relative cost of the facilities.\n1. Solid Waste Disposal\n15. The analysis considered five alternative waste disposal methodologies and concluded\nthat only two are appropriate for this Project: engineered landfill and incineration.\n16. Three  alternative  and  technically  feasible  options  were  drawn  up  for  detailed\nconsideration  in  the  least  cost  analysis.    For  both  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  they  were:  (i)\nengineered landfill, designed for 30 years waste disposal; (ii) engineered landfill, built in two 15-\nyear phases; and (iii) incineration.\n                  \nz  Average length of stay in 1995.

For both islands, options were costed in economic terms, split into foreign and local\ncosts, taxes and duties excluded, and appropriate conversion factors applied.   At this stage, it\nwas  considered  inappropriate  to  attach  conversion  factors  to  land,  since  the  option  for\nincineration did not have a specified site.  Each option was discounted at 12 percent to give the\npresent economic cost of each alternative.\n18. The least cost option in economic terms was the phased landfill for both islands.  The\nanalysis also considered other qualitative factors.  The phased landfill was also the favored\noption when considering implementation considerations, particularly land acquisition, social and\nenvironmental impact, and sustainability.\n2. Septage Treatment\n19. Three alternatives were considered for septic sludge disposal: drying beds, biological\ndigestion, and lagoons. The cost of the options was not prepared to the same level of detail as\nfor solid waste disposal since this would be inappropriate for the analysis. However, both\nquantitative and qualitative factors were included. The preferred alternative is to locate two\nseptage lagoons at the landfill. This option is not the cheapest but it causes fewer health and\nenvironmental problems, is of moderate cost, and is simple to maintain and operate.\nD. Economic Analysis of Project Components\n1. Approach\n20. The analysis determines whether the economic benefits outweigh the economic costs of\nthe Project at the chosen 10 percent economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC).  The analysis\nincludes calculation of an economic incremental rate of return (EIRR) for the Project on each\nisland using the domestic price numeraire and constant 2000 prices.  Solid waste and septage\ntreatment are considered together since the benefits are both environmental and cannot be\nseparated. The analysis includes sensitivity tests, particularly an assessment of the impact on\ntourism that would have to occur to justify the Project.  It also includes an assessment of\nnonvalued factors.  These are particularly important, given the environmental nature of the\nProject and the associated difficulties of valuing benefits.\n2. Economic Costs\n21. The choice of an EOCC of 10 percent is justified, given the environmental nature of the\nProject, which has significant undervalued benefits and nonincremental resource savings that\ncould not be valued in monetary terms. In calculating the EIRR, financial costs were converted\nto economic costs.  Costs were split into local and foreign exchange elements and taxes and\nduties were excluded.  Taxes include a 12.5 percent value added tax (VAT) for all goods and\nservices, and 10 percent duties on specific importsbb. Conversion factors were applied to reflect\nthe opportunity cost of the landcc and the value of unskilled labordd.\n 22. The opportunity cost of land for Rarotonga was assumed to be zero, as it has no\nproductive alternative use.  Apart from taxes and import duties, there are no significant nation-\nwide distortions and the standard conversion factor \u2013 and the shadow exchange rate factor as\n                  \nbb Ministry of Finance and Economic Management.\ncc The value of the land in its next best alternative use.\ndd For unskilled labor which supply is in excess of demand, a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 was used.", "66      Appendix 12, page 5\nwell \u2013 was therefore taken as 1. For Aitutaki, the opportunity cost of land was assumed to be 10\npercent of the financial costs, given the present value of potential earnings from agricultural use.\nTaro was said to be the appropriate crop for the site.  The earnings per acre were based on a\nmarket price of approximately NZ$18-19 per 20 kilogram bag; yields of 2,200kg per acre, as\nadvised by local producers; and production costs of NZ$0.74 per kg published by the Ministry of\nAgriculture.  Discounted over the life of the project the potential revenue stream gives a present\nvalue per acre in the region of NZ$3,000 -- NZ$4,000, or approximately 10 percent of the\nfinancial cost of the land, estimated at NZ$36,000 per acre.\n23. Economic  costs  were  phased  over  the  life  of  the  Project,  which  is  20  years.\nReplacement values were included for material and equipment at appropriate years and a\nresidual value for the civil works component included at the end of the project life ee.\n3. Economic Benefits\na. Valued Benefits\n24. The Project will benefit the residents and nonresidential establishments in Rarotonga\nand Aitutaki. Economic benefits were given value, where possible.  For environmental projects,\nhowever,  valuation  of  project  benefits  is  difficult.    Several  important  benefit  categories\nconsidered qualitative, were excluded from the EIRR calculation.\n25. For  both  islands,  the  valued  economic  benefits  were  calculated  from  an  average\nwillingness  to  pay  (WTP)  based  on  questionnaires  completed  during  the  focus  discussion\ngroups and expected revenues from the nonhousehold sector. Even if a full cost recovery\napproach is not adopted, this is considered appropriate since charges will still be leveled at the\nbusiness sector.\n26. The focus groups enabled leaders and participants to discuss the without-project option\nand the services to be provided under the Project.  Participants were asked how much they\nwould be willing to pay for solid waste services.  Respondents were given the option to indicate\na monetary amount or, alternatively, to indicate which of a number of listed items they would be\nwilling to give up per week to pay for the services.  These items included a range of everyday\ngoods, costing from NZ$2 to NZ$25.  In analyzing the results, where respondents had indicated\nan item that they would be willing to forgo, the equivalent amount in NZ$ was used to calculate\nthe average willingness to payff.\n27. For Rarotonga, net revenues from the additional recycling of aluminium cans, were also\ncalculated and included as a valued benefit. The WTP survey revealed an average willingness\nto pay of around NZ$13 per household for Rarotonga and NZ$11 for Aitutaki.   The expected\nrevenues from the non-household sector include direct user charges and tipping fees.\n28. In  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki,  recycling  of  aluminum  cans  already  takes  place.  An\nestimated additional 41 tons of aluminum cans could potentially be recycled each year in\nRarotonga and an additional 9.9 per year in Aitutaki for 1999.  Assuming that around 70 percent\nof this target is achieved, for Rarotonga this amounts to approximately two containers per\nannum that could be shipped to New Zealand for recycling. This would give a net revenue of\n                  \nee The life of the civil works component was assumed to be 40 years, and that of equipment 10 years.\nff  A conservative approach was adopted in calculating the average willingness to pay.  Where\n   respondents indicated both a monetary amount and an item forgone, the lower value was taken.", "67     Appendix 12, page 6\nNZ$320,000 per annum gg.  For Aitutaki, the additional 9.9 tons amounts to less than one\ncontainer per year, and may be included as a valued benefit in the analysis.\n29.  Since there is no current waste disposal site in Aitutaki, and waste is burned and buried\non land around people\u2019s homes, the immediate visual impact of the \u2018without-project\u2019 situation is\nmore damaging.  For this reason, a small reduction in the number of tourists visiting the island\nhas been valued.  While the immediate impact is not considered to deter large numbers of\ntourists, visual beauty and the environment are the major attractions of Aitutaki and thus a loss\nof 4 percent of revenues is a conservative estimate in the loss of tourism potential.  Assuming\nthat the average visitor stay in Aitutaki is half that in the Cook Islands as a whole, expenditure is\nestimated at NZ$539 per visitor, giving a value of NZ$196,000 per year.\nb. Non-Valued Benefits\n30. For both components, other nonvalued factors that were not considered in calculating\nthe EIRR are important.  They include nonincremental resource savings, recycling and reuse,\nhealth benefits, visual impact, environmental protection, and the potential direct and indirect\neconomic impact of environmental degradation on the tourism industry.\n31. Resource savings include time savings and costs of transportation for residents and\nenterprises that currently dispose of waste themselves.  This is important for Aitutaki, where pits\nare dug, filled and then covered. Uncontrolled dumping tends to create breeding grounds for\nmosquitoes, and other pests.   Health benefits are associated mainly with pest control and with\nsanitation related illnesses.\n32. The  Project  encourages  the  recycling  and  reuse  of  various  elements  of  the  waste\nstream.   The proposed densification of materials enables them to be reused for other purposes,\nor saves volume, increasing the life of the landfill.\n33. Direct impacts are the unsightly appearance of waste pollution of ground water and\nsurface water, and air pollution.  Direct effects have knock-on or indirect impacts.  The unsightly\nappearance may discourage tourists from returning to the islands and lower the reputation of\nthe Cook Islands as a scenic holiday destination, resulting in fewer visitors.  The pollution\neffects tend to be relatively unnoticed.  In the long term, polluted waters and lagoons may lead\nto the destruction of coral and other marine life. This may result in fewer visitors. Protection of\nthe  environment  and  visual  cleanliness  are  considered  conditions  for  long-term  economic\ngrowth, given the dependence on tourism, which contributes about 37 percent GDP.\n4. Economic Internal Rates of Return\n34. Tables A12.1 and A12.2 show the calculation of the EIRR and the sensitivity tests for\nRarotonga and Aitutaki, respectively.  The tables include the calculation of the EIRR under\nsensitivity tests at levels considered appropriate for this Project.  A delay in the benefit stream of\none year is also considered.  Table A12.3 summarizes the results.\n                  \ngg The price of aluminum cans is NZ$1.15 per kg.  Each container carried approximately 15 tons.\n   Shipping costs are NZ$1,900 per container.", "68         Appendix 12, page 7\n35.  For both Projects, the EIRR is higher than the EOCC, which, in accordance with ADB\nguidelines, is assumed to be 10 percent.   For Rarotonga, the EIRR is 12.7 percent.\nOnly under the worst case sensitivity test does the EIRR fall below 10 percent.  Costs\nwould have to increase by 13 percent and benefits would have to decrease by 11\npercent for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC.  For Aitutaki, the EIRR is 13.2 percent.\nUnder the worst case sensitivity tests, the EIRR does fall below 10 percent. Increasing\ncost by 17 percent and decreasing benefits by 15 percent would cause the EIRR to fall\nbelow the EOCC. Given the difficulty of valuing benefits and the conservative approach\nadopted in valuing tourism, these results are seen as acceptable.\nTable A12.3:  Economic Internal Rates of Return and Sensitivity Tests\nItem EIRR Sensitivity Switching\nIndicator Value\nRarotonga\nBase case 12.7\n10.6 1.6 13\nCosts increase by 10%\n10.3 1.8 11\nBenefits reduce by 10%\nCosts  increase  by  10  %  and 8.3\nbenefits reduce by 10%\n10.9\nBenefits delayed by one year\nAitutaki\nBase case 13.2\n11.2 1.3 17\nCosts increase by 10%\n11.0 1.5 15\nBenefits reduce by 10%\nCosts  increase  by  10  %  and 9.2\nbenefits reduce by 10%\nBenefits delayed by one year 10.8\n5. Tourism Impact\n36. In  addition  to  computing  the  EIRR,  the  economic  analysis  calculates  the  overall\nreduction in tourism that would have to occur for the EIRR to fall below the EOCC.  This is\nconsidered an appropriate alternative in assessing the economic benefits of the Project for\ntourism, to estimating the potential number of tourists who would not visit the Cook Islands\nbecause the Project did not materialize.  If the proportion of tourists is low, then there is a strong\neconomic justification for the Project.\n37.  For the EIRR to exceed 10 percent and using tourist revenues as a proxy for valued\nbenefits, incremental revenues in Rarotonga, would have to exceed about NZ$820,000 per", "69   Appendix 12, page 8\nyear.  Given that tourists spend on average NZ$1,078 per person,hh then the estimated number\nof tourist visitors, to generate adequate revenues is only 760, or 1.3 percent of tourist visitors in\n1999.  This demonstrates that, in terms of potential lost tourism revenues, the Project could be\njustified if it avoided a reduction in tourism of about 1 percent.\n38.  For the EIRR to exceed 10 percent and using tourist revenues as a proxy for valued\nbenefits, incremental revenues in Aitutaki, would have to exceed about NZ$240,000 per year.\nAssuming that the average visitor stay in Aitutaki is half that of the Cook Islands as a whole,\nexpenditure is estimated at NZ$539 per visitor, the estimated number of tourist visitors, to\ngenerate adequate revenues is only 445, or 5 percent of tourist visitors to Aitutaki in 1999.  This\ndemonstrates that, in terms of potential lost tourism revenues, the Project could be justified if it\navoided a reduction in tourism of about 5 percent.\n6. Poverty Impact\n39. ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategyii  recognizes  the  vulnerability  of  the  small  island\ncommunities of the Pacific, with their limited ability to deal with external economic shocks.  The\nheavy dependence on tourism in the Cook Islands, estimated at 37 percent of GDP, makes the\neconomy  vulnerable.  Collapse  of  the  tourism  industry  would  have  severe  economic\nconsequences  and  lead  to  a  loss  of  employment  and  income,  not  only  for  those  directly\nemployed in the tourism industry, but also indirectly on local service industries.  The strategy\nstates that the main factor in reducing poverty in recent years has been economic growth, and\nthe resulting opportunities for employment and income growth. Protecting the tourism industry in\nthe Cook Islands is critical to the nation\u2019s economic survival. Without tourism, a large number of\npeople would have no means of income, and poverty levels would increase. Developing of the\ntourism industry, which employs a relatively high proportion of women, will provide further\ngrowth and employment opportunities for residents, and help to lift above the poverty line the\nestimated 10 percent of those families living in poverty.\n40. The  strategy  also  recognizes  poverty  as  a  deprivation  of  essential  assets  and\nopportunities.  This includes access to services such as solid waste disposal and sanitation\nfacilities, which are essential for public health and sound environmental management.\n7. Summary\n41.  Economic dependence on tourism and the importance of the physical environment in\nmaintaining  and  developing  the  tourist  industry  are  critical  in  assessing  this  Project.  The\nimportance  of  maintaining  the  environment  and  other  benefits  that  have  not  been  valued\nindicate that the true worth of the Project is likely to be much higher than the calculated EIRR.\nThe Project is economically justified.\n                  \nhh Tourism, Cook Islands, 2000.\nii  The Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, Mission Statement, 1999.", "Table A12.1: Rarotonga Waste Management \u2013 Economic Analysis (NZ$\u2019000)\nFinancial Costs Economic Costs Economic Benefits Sensitivity Tests\nYear Capital O&M Total Cost Capital O&M Cost Total Cost Household Non Total Net Costs Benefits Costs Benefits\nCost Cost Cost Willingness to Pay residential Recycling Benefit Benefits plus 10% less 10% plus & delayed\nbenefits by one\nless 10% year\nSolid Sanitation Revenues Revenues\nWaste Services\n2001            785            785 533 533 0 -533 -587 -533 -587 -533\n2002         3,836         3,836 3,775 0 3,775 0 -3,775 -4,152 -3,775 -4,152 -3,775\n2003            332            332 311 311 441 93            240              32 805 495 463 414 383 -311\n2004            332            332 311            311 441 93            299              32 864            554            523            467            436            495\n2005            332            332 311            311 441 93            320              32 886            575            544            486            455            554\n2006            332            332 311            311 441 93            335              32 901            590            559            500            469            575\n2007            332            332              -
