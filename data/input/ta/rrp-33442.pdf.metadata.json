This region has natural resources and is\nknown for its scenic landscape and historical sites. Poor accessibility\nand lack of economic transport have limited the development of these\nresources  and  the  region  has  remained  less  developed  with\nconsiderable poverty. The poverty incidence is 21 percent compared\nwith 12 percent in the PRC as a whole. The main cause of poverty is\ninsufficient opportunity for earning income. Transport capability needs to\nbe developed to catalyze economic activity, and create employment and\nincome-generating activities. The Project will provide efficient and low-\ncost transportation for passengers and goods, which will increase the\ndevelopment of natural resources and industry bringing more income to\nthe  local  community  and  thus  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Project's\nconnections  to  the  national  railway  network  will  improve  traffic\nmaneuverability,  reduce  constraints,  and  increase  overall  railway\nefficiency.\nObjectives The goal of the Project is to promote sustainable economic growth that\nand Scope will help reduce poverty in the project area. This will be achieved by\nproviding economic railway transportation in unserved, less developed,\nand poor areas to create the conditions necessary for developing local\nresources,  and  generating  employment  and  income-enhancing\nopportunities  that  will  raise  living  standards.  The  project  scope\ncomprises (i) constructing a 277 km single-track, standard-gauge railway\nbetween Ganzhou and Longyan, including subgrades, bridges, culverts,\nand  tunnels;  (ii)  laying  railway  track;  (iii)  constructing  new  railway\nstations; (iv) providing modern technology and equipment for signaling,\ncommunications, management information system, freight and container\nyard operation, and track maintenance; (v) providing training on the use\nand maintenance of modern equipment; (vi) protecting the environment\nand mitigating adverse environmental effects; (vii) acquiring land and\nresettling affected people; (viii) providing consulting services for design,\nconstruction supervision and quality control, procurement, environmental\nmonitoring, and monitoring of resettlement and social impact; and (ix)\nstrengthening institutional capabilities.", "iii\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $775 million equivalent,\nconsisting of a foreign  exchange  cost  of  $254.7  million  and  a  local\ncurrency cost of $520.3 million equivalent.\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nFinancing Plan Source Exchange Currency Cost\nADB 200.0 0.0 200.0\nCDB 0.0 266.0 266.0\nMinistry of Railways 54.7 254.3 309.0\nTotal 254.7 520.3 775.0\nPercentage 33% 67% 100%\nADB=Asian Development Bank, CDB=China Development Bank.\nLoan Amount The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $200 million\nand Terms from  its  ordinary  capital  resources  under  ADB's  London  interbank\noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility.

The consultants will\nbe recruited internationally in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants. Suitable domestic consulting services for project\ndesign,  construction  supervision  and  quality  control,  procurement,\nmonitoring and evaluation of resettlement and poverty reduction, and\nmonitoring of environmental management will be engaged and financed\nby MOR in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits Construction  and  operation  of  the  railway  will  accelerate  economic\n And Beneficiaries growth  by  lowering  transport  costs,  which  should  lead  to  the\ndevelopment  of  natural  resources  and  new  industries.  These\ndevelopments  will  create  new  employment  and  income-generating\nopportunities  that  will  benefit  people  in  general,  and  the  poor  in\nparticular. The project design incorporates special measures for passing\non  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  to  the  poor.  During  the  five-year  project\nconstruction period, a total of 110,000 person-years of employment will\nbe  created,  of  which  47,500  person-years  will  be  provided  to  poor\nhouseholds. Economic activities induced by the railway are expected to\ncreate  20,100  person-years  of  employment  in  2007,  increasing  to\n60,000 person-years in 2026. About 40 percent of the new employment\nis expected to go to poor people. The resulting increase in income will\nimprove  living  standards  and  decrease  the  number  of  people  living\nbelow the poverty line. Distribution analysis shows that 26 percent of the\nproject benefits will go to the poor. Quantifiable benefits from the Project\ninclude  transport  cost  savings  for  diverted  traffic  that  will  accrue  to\nowners of freight and passengers. The economic internal rate of return\nis estimated at 14.4 percent and the financial internal rate of return at\n6.4 percent.", "v", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Ganzhou-Longyan Railway (GLR) Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Experience with completed railways1 in the PRC financed by the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB), i.e., Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway, Yaogu-Maoming Railway, Guang-Mei-Shan Railway, Hefei-\nJiujiang  Railway,  and  Jing-Jiu  Railway,  and  the  ongoing  railway  projects2  shows  that  the\nconstruction  and  operation  of  railways  can  contribute  significantly  to  stimulating  economic\ndevelopment  in  relatively  poor  areas.  These  projects,  together  with  the  developments  and\nactivities  induced  by  the  lower  cost  of  transport  are  catalyzing  rapid  economic  growth,\ntransforming  local  economies,  enhancing  the  investment  environment  in  the  project  areas,\nenabling access to wider markets and better prices for local products, and generating large-scale\nemployment for local people. Consequently, these projects have significant impacts on improving\nthe incomes and living standards of people in general and reducing poverty in particular.\n3. The  proposed  Project  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  railway  from  Ganzhou  to\nLongyan, traversing eight counties in two prefectures, one each in western Fujian and southern\nJiangxi provinces (maps 1 and 2). It will link the poor and underdeveloped project area with other\nmore prosperous parts of the PRC. The eight counties have a population of 4.1 million, of which\n3.4 million people, or 83 percent, live in rural areas. In 2000, the incidence of rural poverty based\non rural per capita income of Y1,000 per year was 21 percent compared with 12 percent for the\nPRC as a whole. In terms of poverty classification, the Project has been categorized as Other.3\nThe Project supports the thematic priority of economic growth. The improved accessibility and\nlower  transportation  costs  made  possible  by  the  GLR  will  accelerate  economic  growth  by\ndeveloping industries, and natural and agricultural resources. New employment opportunities and\nincome-generating activities will be created that will raise incomes and improve living standards\nbenefiting the people, particularly the poor. The Project has been designed to enhance its pro-\npoor  features.  Without  the  Project,  transport  constraints  would  continue  and  the  sustained\neconomic growth necessary to reduce poverty would not take place.\n4. During the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study4 and an environmental impact assessment\n(EIA)5 were prepared by the Fourth Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways\n(MOR). MOR prepared a resettlement plan (RP). ADB provided technical assistance (TA)6 to\nsupplement the Government studies, including the RP. In addition to TA supervision missions,\n                  \n1 The completed railway projects include Loan 948-PRC: Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, for $39.7 million, approved\non 31 January 1989; Loan 1087-PRC:Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project, for $67.5 million, approved on 20 June\n1991; Loan 1167-PRC:Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 25 June 1992; Loan 1221-\nPRC: Hefei Jiujiang Railway Project, for $110 million, approved on 30 March 1993; and Loan 1305-PRC:Jing-Jiu\nRailway Technical Enhancement Project, for $200 million, approved on 14 July 1994.\n2  The ongoing railway projects include Loan 1439-PRC: Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project, for $100 million, approved\non 4 June 1996; Loan 1553-PRC: Shenmu-Yan'an Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 29 September\n1997; Loan 1626-PRC: Guizhou-Shuibai Railway Project, for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998; and Loan\n1748-PRC: Hefei-Xi'an Railway Project, for $300 million, approved on 17 August 2000.\n3  This classification is used in view of the non-excludable nature of the project benefits.\n4 The feasibility study was approved by the PRC\u2019s State Development Planning Commission in August 2001.\n5  The EIA was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration on 21 May 2001.\n6  TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 30 August 2000 (completed).", "2\nADB missions7 visited the PRC from 27 February to 16 March 2001 (fact-finding) and from 10-26\nMay 2001 (appraisal).

A project framework that outlines the goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs or activities is\nin Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Transport\n5. Infrastructure and Traffic. The implementation of the Government's economic reform\npolicies since 1978 has resulted in rapid growth of the PRC economy, and a sharp increase in the\ndemand  for  transportation  services.  Despite  the  Government's  efforts  to  increase  transport\ncapacity, serious constraints and bottlenecks remain. The land transport system comprises about\n68,000 route-kilometers (km) of railways, 1.35 million km of highways, and 116,100 km of inland\nwaterways. In addition, there are 1.5 million km of civil aviation routes. The density of the transport\nnetwork ranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic area.8\nAlthough infrastructure networks expanded rapidly in the past decade, they have not kept pace\nwith the demand generated by the country's economic growth. Inadequate transportation is a\nconstraint to the sustained efficient growth of the PRC economy.\n6. Between 1985 and 2000, all modes of freight transport grew from 1,837 billion to 4,366\nbillion ton-kilometer (ton-km) or at 5.9 percent per annum. In 2000, the modal split for freight\ntransport (in ton-km) was (i) coastal and inland waterways 54 percent, (ii) railways 31.9 percent,\n(iii) roads 14 percent, and (iv) civil aviation 0.1 percent. Railway freight traffic increased from\n813 billion ton-km in 1985 to 1,257 billion ton-km in 1999 and 1,334 billion ton-km in 2000, or an\nannual increase of 3.4 percent, with a 6.1 percent increase in 2000 compared with 1999.\nRailway  passenger  traffic  increased  from  242  billion  passenger-km  in  1985  to  406  billion\npassenger-km in 1999 and 441 billion passenger-km in 2000, or an annual increase of 4.1\npercent,  with  an  8.5  percent  increase  in  2000  compared  with  1999.  In  2000  road  traffic\naccounted for 54.1 percent of total passenger-km, railways for 36.8 percent, civil aviation for 8.2\npercent, and coastal and inland waterways for 0.9 percent. The railway's share of the total\nfreight and passenger traffic moved by all transport modes declined during 1985-1999; the\nshare increased in 2000.\n7. Investments. Transport in the PRC lags behind the rapidly developing economy, which\ndepends on the efficient transportation of goods and passengers for growth and sustainability.\nInadequate investment in transport up to the early 1990s resulted in transportation inefficiencies\nthat severely constrained the growth of the national economy. To address this situation the\nGovernment substantially increased investment in transport infrastructure in the Ninth Five-Year\nPlan (FYP) (1996-2000). Investment in transport infrastructure as a percent of gross domestic\n                  \n7  The missions comprised R. Soin, Senior Project Engineer and Mission Leader; H. Sakurai, Financial Analyst; Hong\nWei, Senior Financial Economist, PRC Resident Mission; S. Price, Senior Social Development Specialist; D. Tang,\nEnvironment Specialist; and X. Peng, Senior Counsel. F. Agnello, Poverty Reduction Specialist, and S. Curry, Sr.\nProject Economist, assisted the Mission at headquarters.\n8 In terms of density per square km of land area, the PRC's transport network is one sixth of India's network and one\nfifth that of the Republic of Korea.", "3\nproduct (GDP) more than doubled from 0.8 percent in 1990 to 1.9 percent in 1999. To meet the\nincrease in transport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. A World Bank study9\nindicates that total transport investment should be increased to at least 3 percent of GDP to avoid\nthe economic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government has accorded priority\nto transport in the Tenth FYP (2001-2005). Substantial investments in the railway and road\nsectors are envisaged. The Government realizes that to sustain large investments an increasing\nproportion of financing will have to come from both domestic and international private sector\nsources.10\n8. Institutions.  At  the  national  level,  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission\nformulates the five-year development plans, and establishes transport priorities and targets in\nconsultation  with  the  administrative  units  responsible  for  the  various  transport  sectors,  and\nrepresentatives of transport users. MOR administers the national railway system; the Ministry of\nCommunications, national highways, inland waterways, coastal shipping, and major ports; and the\nCivil Aviation Administration, air transport and airports.\n2.  Railway\n9. The 68,000 route-km railway system11 in the PRC comprises 58,000 route-km of the state-\nowned national railway and 10,000 route-km of local railways.12 Under the administrative control of\nMOR the national railway is operated by 14 railway administrations.13 The 1990 Railway Law\nprovides the framework for the regulation and operation of railways in the PRC.14 Given the vast\ndistances between locations of industry and natural resources, as well as the socioeconomic\ndifferences between the PRC's inland and coastal regions, the current dimensions of the railway\nnetwork do not provide adequate geographic coverage.15\n10. The railway system remains the preferred mode of medium- to long-distance intercity\ntransport.  This,  combined  with  economic  growth  and  technological  improvements  for  the\nrailways, ensures a continuing role for railway transport in the future. The railway's competitive\nadvantage is in the transport of bulk and semibulk commodities over medium to long distances,\nlong-distance  passenger  traffic,  and  containerized  freight.  In  2000,  the  national  railway\ntransported almost the same amount of freight traffic and more than 16 times the volume of\npassenger  traffic  as  all  the  railway  lines  in  the  United  States  (US)  combined,  including\ncommuter lines.\n11. As the PRC moves toward a more dynamic, decentralized, and market-driven economy,\nand in the light of increasing competition from the expanding road network, structural reforms\n                  \n9 World Bank. 1995.

The law also specifies the rights and obligations of the Government, MOR, local governments, other\nrailway operators, shippers, and railway users.\n15 Railway network density in terms of route-km per square km of land area is one third that of India and one tenth\nthat of Japan.", "4\ntouching all aspects of railway operation and management are being implemented (beginning in\nthe 1980s) to modernize and improve the efficiency of the railway system. Major reforms were\npreceded by extensive studies and pilot programs. Considering the size and spread of the\nrailway and its critical importance to the PRC\u2019s economy, the reforms were carefully sequenced\nand designed to suit local conditions. A summary of the railway sector reforms is given in\nAppendix 2.\n12. The first important reform initiative was the productivity contract system introduced in\n1986. However, productivity targets alone are not sufficient to operate profitably in a market\nenvironment.  After  a  series  of  pilot  studies  on  management  methods,  in  1999,  the  assets\noperation liability system was introduced for the national railway. Under this system, MOR entered\ninto  management  contracts  with  the  railway  administrations  to  improve  profitability.16  The\nmanagement contracts have helped improve the operational and financial performance of the\nrailway  administrations17  and  the  national  railway  as  a  whole.  In  1999,  the  national  railway\ntransported a total of 1,662 billion converted ton-km, an increase of 4.2 percent over 1998, and\n1,775 billion converted ton-km in 2000, an increase of 6.8 percent over 1999. The safety of\noperation of the railway network also improved during 1999-2000 compared with previous years.18\nIn the drive to improve profitability, MOR has divested its construction enterprises; production\nfacilities for locomotives, passenger coaches, freight wagons, and signaling and communications\nequipment; and 11 captive educational universities.19\n13. To improve productivity and efficiency, operation and maintenance is being modernized,\nwith  over  97  percent  of  the  needed  traction  power  provided  by  modern  electric  and  diesel\nlocomotives. Commercialization is progressing steadily, and excess transportation staff, a legacy\nof the past, are being reduced.20 To provide employment for redundant employees, MOR helped\nset  up  diversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  to  supply\nequipment, goods, and services to the railway industry.21 Several measures have been taken to\nimprove  management  information  systems,  including a point-to-point costing system,22 a\nrevised revenue  settlement  system23  and  a  transportation  management  information  system\n                  \n16 Under the assets operation liability system the performance of railway administrations is evaluated by using\nagreed targets for simultaneously improving profitability, maintaining and increasing fixed assets, and ensuring\nsafety of operation.\n17 For example the two project implementing agencies, the Nanchang Railway Administration increased operating\nprofit from Y62 million in 1998 to Y400 million in 1999 and Y480 million in 2000; while the Shanghai Railway\nAdministration earned a profit of Y140 million in 2000 compared with a loss of Y205 million in 1998 and a loss of\nY153 million in 1999.\n18 The incidence of accidents per million locomotive-km in 1999-2000 was 21 percent less than that during 1996-\n1998, and 41 percent less during 1991-1995.\n19 In September 2000, MOR divested the following six large nontransportation entities, along with the associated\ndebt: (i) South Locomotives and Rolling Stock Industries Corporation, (ii) North Locomotives and Rolling Stock\nIndustries Corporation (iii) China Railway Telecom and Signaling Corporation, (iv) China Railway Construction\nCorporation, (v) China Railway Engineering Corporation, and (vi) China Civil Engineering (Group) Corporation.\n20 The number of employees employed by MOR decreased from 1.93 million in 1996 to 1.49 million in 2000.\nCorrespondingly, productivity in terms of converted ton-km per employee increased from 0.84 million in 1996 to\n1.19 million in 2000, an increase of 9 percent per year.\n21 These enterprises have provided alternative employment to 0.4 million surplus employees of the national railway.\nIn 1999, the total revenue of these companies was Y36 billion with annual profits of Y2.6 billion. This program is an\neffective and socially acceptable approach for reducing staffing levels.\n22 A point-to-point costing system covering 1,200 locations systemwide will be operationalized in 2002. This system\ncan evaluate the costs and profitability of individual traffic movements.\n23 The existing revenue settlement system will be improved by helping railway administrations evaluate interline\nrevenue taking account of the commodity carried and the tariff rate.", "5\n(TMIS).24 Since 1999, various restructuring measures have been taken to improve productivity\nand reduce operating losses on 120 branch lines that comprise about 7,800 km (or 13.4\npercent) of the national network.25 Consistent with the global trend for multimodal transport,\ncontainer traffic is a key area for development. Since the mid-1990s container traffic has been\nincreasing by more than 10 percent per year, more than three times the growth rate for freight\ntraffic.26 These measures will improve service quality, asset utilization and productivity, and\nfinancial performance of the national railway, and help focus on more profitable traffic.\n14. The Government, through the State Council, regulates tariff charges on the national\nrailway. The Government is cautious when considering tariff increases because of the adverse\nimpact on inflation, which has economywide implications. During 1967-1982, tariff rates remained\nunchanged. Since 1983, tariff rates and structures have changed significantly. From Y0.0148 per\nton-km in 1983, the nominal freight tariff increased to Y0.0791 per ton-km in July 2000, an\naverage annual increase of 10.4 percent, which compares with the average annual inflation rate of\n8.4 percent during the same period. The freight tariff includes increases in basic freight tariff and\nsurcharges  to  generate  resources  for  railway  development.  In  March  1990,  a  construction\nsurcharge was added to most commodity freight tariffs, the proceeds of which are credited to a\nseparate railway construction fund (RCF) account with the Ministry of Finance.27 The RCF is\nmainly used for railway construction.28 In April 1993, the Government approved the policy of \"new\nline, new tariff\" to generate revenue for cost recovery and service debt incurred to finance the\nconstruction of new lines. 29 In the same year an electrification surcharge30 was levied on all traffic\nmoving on electrified lines to raise capital for electrification. In 1999, a new commodity-based\nfreight tariff structure and additional charges for freight loading and unloading were introduced.\n15. The basic passenger tariff per passenger-km was raised in stages from Y0.017 in 1985\nto Y0.0586 in 2000, or an average annual increase of 8.6 percent. Since 1992, additional fares\nare  being  charged  to  passengers  availing  of  premium  and  value-added  services.31  The\nexpansion of such services to meet demand increased the revenue collection from passenger\nservices. On a passenger-km basis the ratio of actual revenue to basic tariff increased from\n                  \n24 Following successful trials on the Shanghai Railway Administration, installation of the TMIS on the national\nnetwork was completed in 2000. Similar management information tools have been successfully used for railways\nin the US and Canada. Significantly, the TMIS has been connected to the Internet enabling shippers to monitor\nshipments and passengers to access train schedules on-line. The TMIS will improve the quality of services and\nensure more efficient utilization of assets. Under the Project, the TMIS will be extended to cover the project\nfacilities.\n25 The measures taken include restructuring of branch lines into separate/independent entities or joint ventures with\nprovincial governments and close monitoring of their operational performance. As a result of these measures,\nrevenue on branch lines increased from Y7.5 billion in 1999 to Y8.45 billion in 2000, an increase of 12.6 percent,\nand operating losses on branch lines decreased from Y1,139 million in 1999 to Y915 million in 2000, a fall of 6\npercent.\n26 In 2000, container traffic was 2.6 percent of total freight traffic. To meet demand for container traffic MOR is\nplanning to set up 250 container stations on the national network during the Tenth FYP (2001-2005).\n27 From Y0.003 per ton-km in March 1990, the construction surcharge increased in stages to Y0.033 per ton-km in\n1999. Fertilizers and yellow phosphate are exempt from the construction surcharge, and a lower surcharge is\napplied to rock phosphate and cotton, Y0.0224 per ton-km, and pesticides, Y0.0192 per ton-km. In 2000, Y37.1\nbillion was credited to the RCF.\n28 Since 1993, the RCF has also been used to pay interest on debt incurred for capital investments.\n29 ADB helped MOR to carry out a tariff study to determine a special higher tariff for the Jing-Jiu Railway under TA\n2122-PRC: Policy Support to the Ministry of Railways, for $600,000, approved on 14 July 1994 (completed).\n30 The electrification surcharge increased from Y0.004 per ton-km in April 1993 to Y0.012 in February 1999.\n31 The fare for (i) an airconditioned seat is 50 percent more than for nonairconditioned; (ii) express trains is about 50\npercent more than standard trains, (iii) a soft seat is about 70 percent more than a hard seat; and (iv) sleeper seat\nis 75 percent more than a sitting seat. During the peak holiday season up to a 30 percent premium is charged on\nsome trains.", "6\n1.218  in  1996  to  1.422  in  2000,  reflecting  increased  demand  for  improved  value-added\npassenger transportation services.\n16. In spite of the general and selective tariff increases, the current tariffs of Y0.0791 per ton-\nkm and Y0.0586 per passenger-km are still low by comparison with other transport modes in the\nPRC and by world standards. The selective tariff increases helped augment revenue, but they did\nnot compensate for the phase-out of subsidies on material and energy inputs in the early 1990s,\nwhich adversely affected the profitability of the national railway. However, between 1996 and\n2000, unit revenues from both freight and passenger services increased more than the unit\noperating costs, which improved the financial performance of the national railway.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n17. The lack of railway capacity to meet the increasing demand for transportation services is\nconstraining economic growth. The Government\u2019s plan for railway development gives priority to\n(i)  expanding  the  railway  network  by  constructing  new  railway  lines  to  provide  economic\ntransportation and catalyze growth in poor inland regions; (ii) encouraging the construction of\njoint venture railways to develop local economies; (iii) improving the efficiency of the existing\nsystem by using new technology and modern management tools; (iv) increasing cost recovery by\ncommercializing  services  and  adopting  appropriate  pricing  policies;  (v)  improving  efficiency\nthrough institutional and structural reforms; and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment32 in\ninfrastructure and related services.\n18. The Tenth FYP, covering 2001-2005, envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to\nprovide access to unserved areas with the network length reaching a total of 74,000 route-km;\n(ii)  providing  3,000  km  of  double  lines  and  electrifying  5,000  km  of  key  lines  to  increase\ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km with the total length of such lines\nreaching  15,000  km.  The  Tenth  FYP  envisages  a  total  outlay  of  Y350  billion  for  railway\ndevelopment, consisting of Y270 billion for capital construction33 and Y80 billion for rolling stock.\nAbout one third of this investment will be internally generated; the remaining will be arranged\nfrom domestic markets and foreign sources.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n19. Japan provides largest amount of external financing for the railway sector, followed by the\nWorld Bank and ADB (Appendix 3). Japan and the World Bank have been mainly involved in\nexpanding the capacity of the national railway. In the past 20 years, Japan34 has provided \u00a5558\nbillion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport\ncorridors. Japan has also financed the development of new sections of the national railway\nnetwork in inland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided loans totaling $2.2 billion\nfor seven national railway projects and one local railway project.\n20. ADB  has  focused  on  railway  development  in  less-developed  and  poor  regions  to\npromote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided nine\nloans totaling about $1.4 billion to help finance the construction of 1,754 km of new railway lines\nunder seven local railway projects, and 3,484 km of new railway lines under two national railway\n                  \n32 The Guangshen Railway Company, operating between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, raised $200 million through a\nworldwide offering of shares to finance investments.\n33 During the Ninth FYP (1996-2000) the actual investment for railway capital construction totaled Y250 billion.\n34 Financing from Japan was initially sourced from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, which was merged on\n1 October 1999 with the Export-Import Bank of Japan to form the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.", "7\nprojects. These projects have financed the construction of railway lines in less-developed and\npoor areas, introduced modern technology, and improved the efficiency of railway operation\nthrough institutional and structural reforms. ADB has promoted the commercial operation of\nrailways to achieve full cost recovery and has helped improve the management of railways by\nenhancing their knowledge of (i) commercial operation, traffic costing, and pricing; (ii) market-\noriented business planning and strategies; (iii) financial management and efficient resource\nallocation; and (iv) modern management tools. ADB is supporting the transformation of the\nrailway sector to provide efficient, safe, and quality transport services; maintain financial self-\nsufficiency; and enhance subregional cooperation with neighboring countries in Central Asia\n(covering Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan) and Southeast Asia (covering Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam).\n21. ADB coordinates with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and World\nBank  to  ensure  complementarity  of  aid  involvement  in  the  railway  sector.  During  project\nprocessing, discussions were held with JBIC and World Bank staff regarding their operational\nexperience with ongoing railway programs. The Project is in line with the national priorities for\nrailway development and ADB's strategy in the sector, and complements the investments and\npolicy dialogue of JBIC and the World Bank.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n22. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC shows\nstrong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the executing agencies (EAs) for\nproject implementation. The speed of implementation has generally exceeded the expectations at\nthe time of appraisal. The EAs generally complied with the loan covenants. Resettlement and\nenvironmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in\na timely manner, and the audited financial statements were found generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s\nnine  railway  projects,  five  (footnote  1)  are  complete,  and  four  (footnote  2)  are  under\nimplementation. The major lessons learned and accomplishments under these projects are given\nin Appendix 4.\n23. The key lessons from the previous railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that\nthe  EA  established  for  project  processing  and  implementation  is  also  responsible  for  the\nproject\u2019s operation; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a\nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and\nother transportation modes that may compete with the project facilities; and (iv) finance railway\nprojects with appropriately determined debt-equity ratios.\n24. Previous  railway  projects  have  sparked  socioeconomic  development  in  the  projects'\ninfluence areas. The main impacts experienced were (i) new railway lines in less-developed and\npoor regions stimulated economic development resulting in higher growth rates of GDP and rural\nincomes compared with the without the project scenario;35 (ii) construction activities generated\ndemand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers who would have otherwise remained\nunemployed or underemployed;36 (iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and\n                  \n35 In the project area of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1) the GDP of 10 counties in Jiangxi Province increased from\nY4.9 billion in 1993 to Y15.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 25.5 percent compared with 10.2 percent for the\nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng County increased from Y802 in 1993 to Y2,222 in 1998,\nan annual increase of 18.5 percent compared with 10.3 percent during 1985-1992 (before the project).\n36 During the first two years of construction of the Guizhou-Shuibai Railway (footnote 2), a total of about 7.5 million\nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55 percent were provided to\nlocal poor people thereby raising them above the poverty line.", "8\nbenefited rural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved,\nproviding additional resources for social programs37 and generating employment; (v) supply and\ntransportation of local materials generated employment; (vi) low cost railway transport, compared\nwith the high cost of motorized transport, extended the market spatially by increasing the distance\nto breakeven locations resulting in lower prices of agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which\nstimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers; and increased mobility of\nrural residents and allowed access to more employment opportunities and social services beyond\ntheir immediate community neighborhoods; (vii) counties provided with railway access recorded\nhigher GDP growth rates than those without the railway; (viii) the investment environment was\nenhanced; resulting in rapid development of secondary and tertiary industries that generated\nemployment;38  the  consequent  shift  in  the  structure  of  employment  from  low  productivity\nagriculture  to  higher  productivity  agroprocessing  and  light  industry  increased  employment\nopportunities for women whose incomes and social status then improved;39 (ix) tourism developed\nbecause of more affordable and convenient railway travel; and (x) environmental protection and\nmitigation measures were taken under the projects as agreed at appraisal;40 and environmental\nimpacts of induced developments were addressed in accordance with the EIAs and summary\nEIAs  for  those  projects.  In  summary,  the  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic\ntransformation of the local economies. The per capita rural incomes in the project areas increased\nsubstantially compared with those before the project. Living standards were raised and poverty\nwas reduced. The lessons learned and experiences with the previous railway projects have been\nappropriately incorporated in the design of the Project.\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n25. ADB\u2019s strategy for the PRC emphasizes three broad objectives: (i) improve economic\nefficiency; (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty; and (iii) protect the\nenvironment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three  broad  objectives,  the\nstrategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet the needs of a\ngrowing market economy and contribute to reducing poverty through investment targeting poorer\nareas coupled with policy and institutional reforms.\n26. Recognizing  the  importance  of  railway  transport  in  the  development  of  the  national\neconomy, ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by\nconstructing  new  lines  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas;  (ii)  modernizing  and\nincreasing  the  capacity  on  key  routes  of  the  national  railway  system  to  improve  transport\nefficiency; and (iii) commercializing railway operation to sustain efficient operation. Through this\nstrategy ADB's overarching goal is to reduce poverty. The location of the Project in a less-\ndeveloped and poor region is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy and will promote economic growth and\n                  \n37 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi Province that are traversed by the Jing-Jiu Railway\n(footnote 1) increased from Y0.5 billion in 1993 to Y1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7 percent\ncompared with 12.3 percent during 1985-1992, before construction of the Jing-Jiu Railway.\n38 The Jing-Jiu Railway facilitated the setting up of a large number of resource- and agriculture- based industries in\nXingfeng County of Jiangxi Province. Their number increased from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project\ncompletion. The number of businesses grew from 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons\nemployed in these increased from 18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998, an annual increase of 23 percent. In the\nsame county the number of people living below the poverty line reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a\ndecline by 62 percent.\n39 Beneficial income and social impacts particularly on women were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu-\nMaoming Railway (footnote 1) and Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 1).\n40 The China Academy of Railway Sciences, which monitored environmental management on the Jing-Jiu Railway,\nreported that the environmental requirements in the EIA and the summary EIA were complied with.", "9\nprovide poor people with more access to a broad range of socioeconomic activities, including\nemployment and income opportunities that will improve living standards and reduce poverty.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n27. Policy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway sector\nand  has  effectively  complemented  the  lending  operations.  The  issues  addressed  include\ncommercializing operations, supporting management autonomy of railway operations, developing\nhuman resources, and improving financial management and accounting systems. During the\npolicy dialogue for the Project, poverty reduction aspects of the Project were strengthened. Other\nareas covered included institutional reforms, cost recovery and commercialization, market and\nbusiness development, private sector participation, and nongovernment financing.\n1.  Poverty Reduction\n28. Poverty  reduction  through  pro-poor  economic  growth  is  a  key  aspect  of  the  policy\ndialogue. The Project is located in a poor area. Because of the high incidence of poverty in the\nproject area, poverty reduction was an integral part of project planning and design. Specific\nfeatures included in the project design are aimed at transferring the benefits of the Project to the\npoor.  Issues  discussed  include  (i)  obtaining  commitment  from  the  project  proponent,\nimplementing  agencies,  monitoring  agencies,  and  the  concerned  prefecture  and  county\ngovernments to pursue pro-poor policies to maximize the benefits to the poor during project\nplanning, implementation, and operation; (ii) providing employment during construction and\noperation of the GLR on a preferential basis to poor workers; (iii) supplying local materials that\nmeet the requirements of quality and economy from poor villages; (iv) providing station access\nroads and link roads to widen the Project's benefits to poor interior areas; (v) supporting poverty\nreduction programs of local governments to complement the poverty reduction efforts under the\nProject; and (vi) obtaining commitment from local governments to implement pro-poor policies in\nthe project influence area.\n2.  Institutional Reform\n29. ADB has supported institutional reform of the PRC's railway sector to separate the\nGovernment's ownership and regulatory role from operation, giving full play to market forces for\nimproving efficiency. Passenger and freight operations will be undertaken by enterprises that\noperate in a competitive environment. The ongoing restructuring of railways will help create an\nenvironment that will attract private sector capital for railway development, including developing\nspecialized railway transport services and improving efficiency and the quality of service. For\nnew investments, railway enterprises will have to ensure financial viability through increasing\ncommercialization of operations (para 31). New railways that the Government requires to be\nbuilt mainly to develop unserved inland areas and directly reduce poverty will continue to be\nfinanced by the Government. MOR will pursue these areas of reform.41\n30. The PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) 42 will open up railway transport\nservices to foreign investors and operators.43 This development needs to be taken into account\n                  \n41 Due consideration will also be given to the lessons learned from reforms on railway systems in other countries\n(i.e., the United Kingdom, US, and Japan).\n42 Under WTO accession commitments, foreign investors would be able to (i) acquire minority shareholding in joint\nventures for freight services after the PRC's accession to the WTO, (ii) acquire majority shareholding within three\nyears thereafter, and (iii) set up solely foreign-owned companies within six years after the PRC's accession to the\nWTO.", "10\nfor future restructuring of the national railway along market principles. In addition, the structure\nof transport demand may change with trade liberalization. MOR will therefore need to consider\nvarious institutional, operating, and technical options in its strategy for the structural adjustment\nof the railways. Under the Project, MOR will receive assistance in evaluating the implications of\nWTO  accession  commitments  on  railway  operation,  including  measures  necessary  for\nimproving operational performance.\n3.  Commercialization\n31. ADB has supported commercializing the railway operations with full cost recovery to\nensure financial sustainability. A key element of the policy dialogue under ADB-financed railway\nprojects has been the establishment of pricing policies that facilitate optimal intermodal choices\nand efficient use of the railway. Tariffs will be set for full cost recovery while considering market\nconditions and the socioeconomic situation in the area served. MOR will apply the policy of new\nline, new tariff to the GLR and ensure full cost recovery, covering operation and maintenance\ncosts, depreciation, and debt service in excess of depreciation, taxes, and a reasonable profit,\nduly considering the price elasticity of traffic. This policy will be reflected in a tariff study that will\nbe carried out by MOR to determine the tariffs to be applied on the GLR before the start of\ncommercial operation (para. 84). Marketing efforts will be strengthened to include analysis and\nforecast of passenger and freight customers\u2019 demands for railway services. MOR will continue\nto eliminate excess staff to improve productivity. The performance of passenger transportation\ncompanies will be monitored with greater emphasis on improving service quality consistent with\ndemand.\n4.  Marketing and Business Development\n32. The Government is addressing transportation constraints by constructing new railway\nlines and expanding the capacity of existing lines. As the PRC progresses to a market-driven\neconomy, the railway will compete on service quality for demand-based transportation services.\nIt will need to rely more heavily on new marketing and business initiatives and cost-effective\noperations. To be able to do this, the railway should offer new and improved customer services\nand increase productivity through marketing and business initiatives in freight and passenger\nservices. MOR will pursue these initiatives; assistance will be provided under the Project.\n5.  Private Sector Participation and Nongovernment Financing\n33. In line with ADB's private sector development strategy, a wider role for the private sector\nis envisaged during project implementation. MOR has taken steps to create the conditions\nnecessary to attract investment in the project facilities and services from nongovernment and\nprivate sector sources. Possible areas include construction of industrial sidings, tourism, and\ncontainer and luggage-related businesses. The strategic proximity of the GLR to Xiamen Port\nwill provide a good impetus to private sector operations in the project influence area.44 The GLR\nwill expand the hinterland of Xiamen Port into interior areas that are largely poor and help create\nthe conditions necessary for local governments to attract private investments for industrial\ndevelopment.\n   \n43 In  August  2000,  MOR  and  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Trade  and  Economic  Cooperation  jointly  promulgated\nregulations on approval and management of foreign-funded railway freight transport enterprises.\n44 ADB is providing assistance under Loan 1584-PRC: Xiamen Port Project, for $50 million, approved on 27\nNovember 1997, to expand the port's cargo-handling capacity to meet demand and provide market access to\nresource-rich but less-developed neighboring inland areas.", "11\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n34. Located  in  a  poor  and  less-developed  area,  the  Project  will  catalyze  economic\ndevelopment and help reduce poverty. Progress in reducing poverty in the PRC has been\nsignificant  particularly  in  the  coastal  areas  and  urban  centers  where  markets,  skills\ndevelopments, and new technologies are easily accessed. Nevertheless poverty has persisted\nin some inland regions, such as the eight counties/district (footnote 49) in southern Jiangxi and\nwestern  Fujian  provinces,  which  comprise  the  project  influence  area.  Reducing  the  more\nintransigent poverty in this largely mountainous area will require reaching out to the remote rural\npopulation with small-sized and low-quality agricultural land, little access to modern technology\nand training, and no cost-effective means to transport raw materials and products. This region\nhas rich natural resources (i.e., metallic ores, coal, limestone, and granite) and is known for its\nscenic landscape and historical sites. But poor accessibility and the high cost of motorized\ntransport have limited development and this region has remained less developed and poor.\nBased on experience with previous railway projects, cost-effective railway transportation will\ninduce the sustainable development of natural resources and industries, and market-based\nagriculture that will improve productivity and raise individual households out of poverty. It will\nhelp increase domestic resource mobilization by local governments. In view of these reasons,\nthe Government characterizes the GLR as a key poverty reduction project in the Tenth FYP\n(2001-2005).\n35. The GLR\u2019s strategic positioning between the port of Xiamen and the Jing-Jiu Railway (a\nmajor north-south railway artery, which ADB helped finance), and its connections to the national\nnetwork will improve traffic maneuverability, reduce transportation constraints, and lower network\ntransportation costs. The GLR will provide an important transit link to the less-developed and poor\nsouthwest regions of the PRC when the proposed railway link from Ganzhou to Chenzhou and\nLiuzhou in Guangxi is constructed.45\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n36. The Project's goal is to promote sustainable economic growth that will help reduce\npoverty in the project area. This will be achieved by providing economic railway transportation in\nunserved, less-developed, and poor areas to create the conditions necessary for developing\nlocal resources and generating employment and income-enhancing opportunities that will raise\nliving standards, particularly for the poor.\n37. The  project  scope  comprises  (i)  constructing  a  single-track,  standard-gauge  railway\n(about 277 km long)46 between Ganzhou and Longyan, including subgrades;47 141 bridges with\na total length of 33 km; 970 culverts; and 99 tunnels with a total length of 61 km;48 (ii) laying\nrailway track consisting of rails and accessories, concrete sleepers, and stone ballast; (iii)\nconstructing 14 new railway stations complete with facilities; (iv) providing modern technology\n                  \n45 Preliminary investigations and survey of the proposed railway link to the PRC's southwest are in progress.\n46 About 120 km or 43.3 percent of the GLR\u2019s total length, in Jiangxi Province, falls in the jurisdiction of the Nanchang\nRailway Administration, and the remaining 157 km, or 56.7 percent, in Fujian Province, is in the jurisdiction of the\nShanghai Railway Administration.\n47 The subgrade includes retaining walls, protection of earth slopes from erosion, protection against scouring,\ngroundwater drains, and other works that support environmental protection.\n48 There are 13 bridges more than 500 m, and four tunnels more than 4 km long.", "12\nand equipment for signaling, communications, transportation management information system,\nfreight  and  container  yard  operation,  and  mechanized  maintenance  of  track;  (vi)  providing\ntraining on the use and maintenance of modern equipment; (vii) protecting the environment and\nmitigating adverse environmental effects; (viii) acquiring land and resettling affected people; (ix)\nproviding  consulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision  and  quality  control,\nprocurement, environmental monitoring, and monitoring of resettlement implementation and\npoverty reduction; and (x) strengthening the institutional capacity of the EA.\nC.  Technical Justification\n1.  Project Area\n38. The GLR, connecting the cities of Ganzhou and Longyan, crosses eight counties/district\nin two prefectures and two provinces.49 The western half of the alignment is hilly terrain with\ngenerally favorable conditions for agriculture. From the center section eastward, the topography\nis moderately mountainous with complex and faulted strata. At the western end, the GLR will\nconnect to the existing Ganxian station of the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1). The existing Jing-Jiu\nfacilities at the Ganzhou passenger station and Ganzhou east district station will be improved\nunder the Project. On the eastern end, the GLR will connect to the existing Longyan west\npassenger station (on the Zhangping-Longyan-Meizhou Railway), which will be expanded by\nMOR together with the Tieshanyang district station on the Zhangping-Longyan line. The recently\nupgraded national highways 319 and 323 are within a few kilometers of the GLR and are\ngenerally parallel to it (map 2).\n2.  Traffic Forecast\n39. Though a relatively small link in the overall national network, the GLR provides a direct\nrailway link to the port of Xiamen (footnote 44) from the north-south Jing-Jiu Railway. Xiamen's\nrapid growth in the 1990s is expected to continue, with the port traffic also maintaining its growth\ntrend. Relatively little of this traffic is moving currently by rail, mainly because direct rail service\nto the port's natural hinterland to the west is not yet available and the existing railway link is\ncircuitous and congested. The GLR\u2019s direct link to the Jing-Jiu Railway will also help reduce\ncongestion  along  the  north-south  movement  of  freight  to  and  from  the  already  congested\nsouthern ports by diverting some traffic to Xiamen.\n40. Freight traffic was forecast by commodity (i.e., metallic ores, grain, coal, iron and steel,\ntimber, fertilizer, petroleum, and others), and in three categories differentiated by their economic\nimpact: (i) diverted rail traffic from other lines to the GLR based on projected traffic on the\nnetwork by major commodity groups, and reduced overall railway operating costs in the national\nnetwork as a result of the GLR; (ii) traffic diverted from the road based on an assessment of the\nrelative service and cost competitiveness of the GLR; and (iii) additional generated traffic that\nwould  not  move  except  due  to  the  GLR.  The  forecast  of diverted traffic is based on MOR's\n                  \n49 The eight counties/district are Ganxian, Huichang, Ruijin, and Yudu counties in Ganzhou City (prefecture-level);\nand Changting, Liancheng, and Shanghang counties, and Xinluo District in Longyan City (prefecture-level).\nExcepting Ganxian County and Xinlou District, the remaining six intermediate counties are national-level poverty\ncounties with the exception of Ruijin, which is a provincial-level poverty county.", "13\nrailway  investment  strategy  model.50  The  forecast  of  generated  traffic  is  based  on  market\nsurveys and the assessment of consultants for TA 3486 (footnote 6), which was prepared in\nconsultation with local communities and industry representatives.51 The forecast of freight traffic\ntakes into consideration the lessons learned on previous railway projects as well as the trend of\ndeclining freight traffic intensity in the PRC.52 A summary of the traffic forecasts is given in Table\n1 and details are given in Appendix 5.\nTable 1: Summary of Traffic Forecasts\n(million)\nType of Traffic 2007 2011 2016 2021 2026\nFreight (tons)\nTransit 6.3 7.6 9.5 11.7 14.5\nOther than Transita 3.8 5.2 7.6 11.2 16.3\nTotal (tons) 10.1 12.8 17.1 22.9 30.9\nTotal (ton-km) 1,979.0 2,453.0 3,219.0 4,258.0 5,681.0\nPassenger (number) 2.7 5.2 7.9 10.9 11.1\nTotal (passenger-km) 377.0 719.0 1,091.0 1,516.0 1,535.0\na Includes originating, terminating, and local traffic.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n41. Freight volume on the GLR is forecast to increase from about 2 billion ton-km in 2007 to\n5.7 billion ton-km in 2026, an annual growth rate of 5 percent. Passenger traffic is forecast to\nincrease from 377 million passenger-km in 2007 to 1,535 million passenger-km in 2026, an\naverage annual increase of 7.6 percent. These growth rates are lower than the actual and\nforecast  growth  rates  for  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (7.1  percent  for  freight  and  8  percent  for\npassengers). The assumed growth rates for traffic are considered realistic and achievable for\nthe new line. Transit traffic, utilizing the shorter distances and the higher efficiency that the GLR\nwill provide to the national network, accounts for about 62 percent of the total traffic in 2007 and\n47 percent in 2026. Generated traffic accounts for the remainder.53 Poor access and the high\ncost of motorized transport (about Y0.70 per ton-km) have limited the development of natural\nresources that have low commodity value in relation to weight and bulk. Cheaper transportation\non the GLR (with freight tariff of about Y0.21 per ton-km) will foster the sustainable development\nof  natural  resources  and  industries  that  will  increase  generated  traffic.  As  the  economy\nliberalizes,  both  business  and  personal  travel  are  expected  to  expand.  The  PRC's  0.8\npassenger trips per capita by rail in 2000 is low compared with other developing countries.\nRailway passenger traffic is expected to grow faster than the economy as a whole.\n42. The port of Xiamen handles 18 million tons per year including 1.1 million containers (20-\nfoot equivalent units). The increase in container traffic has been dramatic, largely due to relaxation\nof trade restrictions with Taipei,China, enabling direct trade instead of through Hong Kong, China.\nThe GLR will provide a significant gateway to the east-west raiIway system connecting to the port\nof Xiamen. The Project is already acting as a powerful stimulus to improve infrastructure including\nroads in the project influence area. To develop container traffic on the GLR and the adjoining\nnetwork, the Project will provide equipment for handling and transporting containers. MOR has\n                  \n50 The Railway Investment Strategy model developed by MOR is used for traffic forecasting and evaluating railway\ncapacity expansion. Traffic forecasting was done by simulation trials using field survey data under with and without\nproject line scenarios to obtain commodity-specific traffic volume on the project line by traffic type, i.e., diverted\nfrom other railway lines, diverted from road, and generated. Validation of the results under TA 3486 show that the\nmodel provided sufficiently accurate traffic estimates both for the national network and the GLR.\n51 The final report for TA 3486 contains a comprehensive list of potential shippers.\n52 Between 1985 and 1999, freight intensity in the PRC per dollar of GDP declined from 17 ton-km to 4 ton-km.\n53 The GLR's generated freight traffic on ton per route-km basis is conservatively estimated at about 10 percent less\nthan the average for the national network.", "14\ngiven assurance that it will efficiently operate these facilities.54 Transportation improvements will\ncatalyze the development of natural resources and associated industries. Local governments are\nseeking private sector companies to invest in their areas.55 Given the growth potential of the\nregion, the Government\u2019s priority for developing the project influence area, as well as the direct\ntransportation  link  to  Xiamen  Port  provided  by  the  GLR,  the  freight  and  passenger  traffic\nforecasts are considered reasonable.\n3.  Design Standards\n43. Consistent with the traffic forecasts, the GLR will be built as a single-track railway with\ndiesel traction. Conversion to electric traction will take place after a suitable buildup of traffic. The\nalignment of the GLR was selected from various alternatives after consultation with the local\nresidents  and  taking  into  account  technical  feasibility  and  the  need  to  minimize  involuntary\nresettlement and environmental impacts. The TA consultants and ADB missions reviewed the\nalignment  and  concluded  that  it  was  an  optimal  and  economic  solution  for  meeting  the\ntransportation needs of the region.\n44. The GLR will be constructed to MOR\u2019s class I technical standards. For track facilities, 50\nkilogram per meter (m) rail will be used on concrete sleepers (with a density of 1,760 sleepers per\nkm) laid on stone ballast. The gradient will generally be 0.6 percent and the minimum curvature\n1,200 m, except in the mountainous sections where the maximum gradient will be 1.5 percent and\nthe minimum curvature 550 m. Crossing lines at stations will have a length of 880 m enabling\nfreight trains of 3,500 tons to be hauled matching the standard train size for the Jing-Jiu Railway.\nFor train control, a semiautomatic block relay signaling system with electric interlocking and color\nlight signals will be used, and fiber-optic cable for communications. Operational safety will be\nenhanced by providing equipment to detect hot bearings of the rolling stock. Initially 14 stations (9\nfor passengers and freight, and 5 for passengers only) will be constructed. Additional stations and\npassing loops will be constructed in the future to meet increases in railway transport demand.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n45. The total cost of the Project, including provision for physical and price contingencies,\ninterest and other charges during construction, and front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount\nis estimated at $775 million. This comprises $254.7 million (33 percent) in foreign exchange cost\nand $520.3 million (67 percent) in local currency cost. The cost estimates are based on quantities\nderived from the technical designs and market prices for goods and materials, and include the\ncosts of land acquisition, resettlement, compensation, environmental protection, and measures to\nmitigate adverse effects, and provide for resettlement and environmental monitoring. The project\ncost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 6. The GLR's cost of $2.9\nmillion per km compares well with the $3.2 million per km for the Guizhou Shuibai Railway\n(footnote 2) and $3.0 million per km for the Hefei-Xi'an Railway (footnote 2 ).\n                  \n54 The operation and management of container facilities will be done in consultation with the China Railway\nContainer Transport Center, which has the necessary expertise.\n55 Counties traversed by the GLR are providing various incentives to attract investors. A number of inefficient state\nenterprises have been restructured as joint ventures that are planning substantial investment.", "15\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

The PRC has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources to\nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an\ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent\n(the fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversions options that may be exercised in accordance\nwith  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations  and  ADB's  Conversion\nGuidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The\nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for the PRC's decision to borrow under ADB's\nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking\nthat these choices were the PRC's own independent decision and not made in reliance on any\ncommunication or advice of ADB.\n47. MOR and the China Development Bank will finance all other project costs, including\ninterest and commitment charges during construction on the loan amount. A summary of the\nfinancing plan is given in Table 3.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nADB 200.0 0.0 200.0 25.8\nCDB 0.0 266.0   266.0 34.3\nMOR 54.7 254.3 309.0 39.9\nTotal 254.7 520.3 775.0 100.0\nADB=Asian Development Bank, CDB=China Development Bank, MOR=Ministry of Railways.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n48. MOR will provide $309.0 million equivalent of internally generated funds from the RCF.\nThe China Development Bank will provide a term loan of $266 million equivalent to be repaid\nover 9 years after a 6-year grace period. Because of the poverty reduction aspects of the\nProject, the loan will carry an interest rate of 5.9 percent per annum. MOR will cover any cost\noverruns including cost increases that could arise from higher than projected inflation and\nunanticipated exchange rate variations. The Government and MOR have agreed to make timely\nprovision of sufficient counterpart funds to complete the Project as scheduled.", "16\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Implementation\n49. The Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations, in whose jurisdiction the GLR will\nbe located (footnote 45), will be responsible for all aspects of project implementation, including\nplanning  and  scheduling  of  works,  contract  preparation,  bidding,  supervision,  quality,  and\npayments.56 The construction organizations under the two railway administrations have qualified\nstaff with experience on similar projects. Both implementing agencies will ensure that the quality\nof construction conforms with national standards.57 Implementation of the Project by the two\nimplementing agencies will be coordinated by MOR\u2019s project coordination office supported by\nit\u2019s planning, construction, financial, and technical departments, as well as the Foreign Capital\nand Technical Import Center (FCTIC). FCTIC will undertake the procurement of ADB-financed\ncomponents, monitor utilization of the ADB loan, and maintain liaison with ADB. FCTIC has\nwell-qualified and experienced staff who have undertaken similar tasks satisfactorily in the\npast.58 Preliminary preparations for construction will start in the second half of 2001; the civil\nworks are scheduled to start in early 2002. The construction of civil works and track laying will\ngenerally proceed from both ends of the Project. The Project will be constructed over a five-year\nperiod  and  be  completed  in  June  2006.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in\nAppendix 7.\n2.  Procurement\n50. Civil works and goods to be financed by ADB will be procured following international\ncompetitive bidding or international shopping procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement, and using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. Each supply contract estimated to\ncost less than $500,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of international shopping. ADB-\nfinanced civil works contracts will be packaged on the basis of vertical slicing.59 A list of contract\npackages to be financed by ADB is given in Appendix 8. For procurement of the ADB-financed\ncontract packages, international tendering companies selected in accordance with competitive\nnational procedures will assist FCTIC. MOR-financed civil works and goods will be procured\nfollowing the Tendering and Bidding Law.60 MOR has agreed to include the relevant sections of\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy61 in all bidding documents and contracts.62\n                  \n56 Both railway administrations have set up project implementation offices with qualified and experienced staff. These\noffices are carrying out initial preparations for the Project.\n57 Contractors risk a three-year disqualification for substandard work.\n58 FCTIC successfully completed procurement under Loan 1305 (footnote 1), and is carrying out procurement under\nLoan 1748 (footnote 2) satisfactorily.\n59 To ensure homogeneity of civil works, each contract will include subgrade, bridges, tunnels, and other works, but\nwill exclude specialized items such as track, signaling, telecommunications, and electric power supply, which will\nbe undertaken by contractors with the required experience.\n60 The Tendering and Bidding Law, which took effect on 1 January 2000, prescribes bidding conditions for large-\nscale infrastructure construction projects that are fully or partly financed by the Government or by international\nfinancing  organizations.  ADB  provided  assistance  for  preparing  standard  bidding  documents  for  domestic\nprocurement under TA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulations for the Public Sector, for\n$565,000, approved on 20 August 1997.\n61 ADB.1998. Anticorruption Policy (On-line). Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption.\n62 The bidding documents and contracts for civil works will include special conditions requiring contractors to (i) hire\n50 percent of the unskilled workers from poor households, (ii) procure local materials that meet the requirement of\nquality and economy from poverty villages, (iii) implement environmental protection and mitigation measures in\naccordance with the EIA and summary EIA, and (iv) ensure the health care of construction workers.", "17\n51. The Government\u2019s request to undertake advance action for procurement of civil works\nwas approved by ADB on 9 April 2001.63 Advance action will enable MOR to make preparations\nto start construction of civil works according to the schedule. A delay in construction would delay\nthe  start  of  commercial  operation  and  realization  of  project  benefits.  Timely  construction  is\nimportant  because  the  Project  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  expand  infrastructure\ninvestment to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in a poor and less-developed region.\nThe advance action includes all procurement activities up to the stage of contract award. The\nGovernment and MOR were advised that approval of the advance procurement action would not\ncommit ADB to finance the Project. An imprest account will be established to facilitate project\nimplementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s imprest fund procedures.64 The Mission ascertained\nthat MOR has sufficient capabilities for accounting, internal control, and auditing procedures to\nensure smooth operation of the imprest account.\n3.  Consulting Services\n52. The ADB loan will finance eight person-months of international consulting services to\nhelp MOR (i) evaluate the implications of PRC's accession to the WTO on the development,\noperation, and management of the railway system, and propose measures for sustainable\noperation  in  an  evolving  market  environment;  and  (ii)  strengthen  marketing  and  business\ndevelopment functions, including training of key railway staff (for a total period of eight staff-\nmonths). Terms of reference for the international consultants, who will be recruited in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, are given in Appendix 9. The provisions of\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and  contracts  for\ninternational consultants.\n53. MOR, through FCTIC and the implementing agencies, will engage and finance suitable\ndomestic consultants for project design, international procurement, construction supervision and\nquality  control,  monitoring  of  environmental  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of\nresettlement, and evaluation of poverty reduction. Past experience with similar projects confirms\nthe availability of adequately qualified and experienced domestic consultants to satisfactorily\nundertake these tasks. The engagement of domestic consultants will be done in accordance with\nGovernment procedures acceptable to ADB.65\n4.  Land Acquisition\n54. For GLR construction, a total of 1,017 hectares (ha) of land will be permanently acquired\nand an additional 200 ha will be acquired for temporary use during construction. The institutional\nresponsibility for implementing land acquisition will rest with the provinces, prefectures, and\ncounties traversed by the GLR. MOR will pay compensation to the provincial governments in\naccordance with the land administration laws of the PRC.66 The provinces will compensate the\nrelevant local governments, which will deal directly with the village collectives and individuals\naffected. The two prefectures and eight counties crossed by the GLR have established railway\nconstruction support offices (RCSOs) to facilitate land acquisition in consultation with the county\nland administration bureaus. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at\n$38 million equivalent and will be financed by MOR. The Government has assured that these\n                  \n63 Advance procurement action was reported in the May 2001 issue of ADB Business Opportunities.\n64 MOR is operating an imprest account under Loan 1748 (footnote 2).\n65 MOR  has  engaged  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute  for  survey,  design,  and  environmental  impact\nassessment of the Project.\n66 The compensation for land acquired will be based on the agreements negotiated by MOR with the provincial\ngovernments of Fujian and Jiangxi.", "18\nfunds, including funds necessary to finance cost overruns, will be made available in a timely\nmanner. Resettlement under the Project is discussed in paras 72 to 76.\n5.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n55. MOR has agreed that arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be made for reporting on\nproject implementation progress. MOR will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project\nimplementation covering progress with procurement, civil works, environmental management,\nland  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  employment  created,  and  other  socioeconomic\nimpacts during construction and initial operation of the GLR. The progress reports will compare\nthe original implementation schedule with actual progress during the period under review; provide\ncontract award and disbursement projections; assess compliance with loan covenants; provide\ninformation on operations, problems that would affect the implementation schedule, together with\naction taken or proposed to be taken; and include a program of activities during the following\nquarter. They will also document the progress of station access and link roads. A midterm review\nof the Project will be undertaken by ADB in consultation with the Government and MOR during the\nthird year of project implementation.\n56. MOR's financial management system has the capacity to provide accurate and timely\nreports  on  the  financial  status  of  the  Project  and  MOR's  overall  operation.  During  project\nimplementation MOR will maintain separate project accounts for all project expenditures financed\nfrom the ADB loan and domestic sources.67 MOR will produce annual financial reports comprising\nan income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The project accounts and financial\nstatements of MOR will be audited by the PRC\u2019s National Audit Office, which has undertaken\nsimilar work on previous projects financed by ADB and the World Bank.68 Within nine months of\nthe end of each related fiscal year, MOR will submit to ADB the audited project accounts and its\naudited financial statements, including the auditor's opinion in English. To facilitate postevaluation\nof the Project, MOR will furnish to ADB within three months of the physical completion of the\nProject, a report on project implementation, in such detail as ADB may require.\n6.  Implementation of Related Facilities\n57. Connected Railway Improvements. The impact of the GLR on traffic on the adjoining\nnetwork was reviewed. Construction of the GLR will increase traffic on the Longyan-Zhangping\nline (map 2). To cope with this increase, the existing track and operations on this line will need\nimprovements.  The  Shanghai  Railway  Administration  is  developing  plans  for  improving  the\nterminal facilities at Longyan and enhancing capacity on the Longyan-Zhangping line. MOR has\nassured that the required improvements will be completed in a timely manner. The progress of the\nconnected railway improvements will be monitored by MOR and reported to ADB through the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation.\n58. Industrial Sidings. Industrial sidings improve transport efficiency by linking the railway\nand the manufacturing and warehouse facilities of major shippers thereby eliminating handling\nand road transport costs for local delivery. Providing industrial sidings to handle large volumes of\n                  \n67 The  Mission  confirmed  that  MOR  has  the  expertise  to  prepare  accounts  and  conduct  internal  auditing  in\naccordance with the Government\u2019s standards.\n68 ADB is providing assistance under TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000,\napproved  on  26  November  1998,  to  strengthen  auditing  standards  and  procedures  to  conform  with  the\nrequirements of the Audit Law and international auditing standards and procedures. A training program will be\ncarried out for Government auditors to promote full and consistent adherence to the auditing standards and\nprocedures.", "19\nfreight will improve the competitiveness of railway services. The study under TA 3486 (footnote 6)\nidentified potential industrial sidings whose construction would open up resource-rich areas for\ndevelopment. Both Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations are pursuing opportunities to\nincrease  traffic  and  freight  revenue  and  have  been  proactively  discussing  the  provision  of\nindustrial  sidings  with  potential  customers.  MOR  has  given  assurance  that  potential  major\nshippers along the GLR will be encouraged, and assistance will be provided as necessary to\nconstruct and operate industrial sidings.\n59. Service Roads, Station Access Roads, and Link Roads. About 150 km of service\nroads  will  be  built  to  facilitate  GLR  construction.  These  service  roads  will  be  laid  out  in\nconsultation with local governments to provide access to villages and communities in the interior\nthat currently have no access. On completion of railway construction, the service roads will be\nhanded over to local governments for use by local people. About 17 access roads (with total\nlength of about 25 km) will connect the new railway stations on the GLR route with the nearest\ncounty/township. Eight link roads (with a total length of 570 km) will be upgraded to provide\nconnections between the railway and the hinterland (Appendix 10). These roads will maximize the\nbenefits of the GLR to townships and villages in the interior and provide wider market access for\npeople living in those areas. Local governments will construct the station access roads and link\nroads concurrently with the Project using their own resources. MOR will report the progress of\nconstruction of the station access roads and link roads to ADB through the quarterly progress\nreport on project implementation.\n7.  Operation and Maintenance\n60. The GLR will be operated by the Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations of MOR\nin their respective jurisdictions (footnote 46). GLR operation will be integrated with that of these\nrailway administrations, which will be responsible for the management, operation, repair, and\nmaintenance of the GLR facilities. The performance of MOR in the repair and maintenance of\nfacilities under previous projects has been satisfactory. MOR has assured that a sufficient number\nof trained staff and resources will be made available to meet the operational needs of the GLR,\nand a sufficient quantity of rolling stock (locomotives, freight wagons, and passenger cars) will be\nprovided to meet the traffic demand and operate the GLR efficiently.\n8.  Safety of Operation\n61. The Railway Law requires that the safety of passengers and freight transport be ensured\nduring  operation.  MOR  has  the  management  and  organizational  capability  to  monitor  the\ncondition of the railway infrastructure and its operation, and ensure the safety of passengers and\nfreight.  MOR  is  implementing  programs  for  human  resource  development  and  equipment\nmodernization that have significantly improved the safety on the national network (footnote 18).\nMOR has assured that upon completion, the GLR will be operated and maintained efficiently\nensuring the safety of freight and passengers. Railway travel is safer than travel by road,\nparticularly in mountainous areas. Consequently, net traffic safety benefits are associated with\nthe Project.\n9.  Project Performance Management System\n62. MOR and ADB have agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project\nperformance. These include indicators for (i) sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction,\n(ii) resettlement of affected people, and (iii) performance of the Project and MOR as the EA.\nDuring construction and initial operation, employment created, particularly that benefiting poor", "20\nhouseholds,  will  be  monitored  and  reported  through  the  quarterly  report  on  project\nimplementation. Indicators for economic growth (i.e., GDP per capita, net rural income per capita,\nand number of people living below the poverty line will be monitored on an annual basis and\ncompared  with  the  baseline  values  before  the  start  of  construction.  Indicators  for  physical\noperation of the GLR and financial performance of MOR will be monitored on an annual basis and\nthe results compared with the appraisal forecasts. MOR will prepare and maintain records of\nphysical operation on the GLR and MOR's financial performance for five years, starting from the\nfirst full year of commercial operation, which will be provided to ADB within nine months of the end\nof each fiscal year. The details of indicators for performance monitoring, monitoring and reporting\nagencies, and the frequency and duration of monitoring are given in Appendix 11.\n10.  Anticorruption Measures\n63. During project processing ADB's anticorruption policy was explained to MOR. Attention\nwas drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB's Guidelines on Procurement and\nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Special attention was drawn to the need for\ncontractors, suppliers, and consultants to observe the highest standards of ethics in the bidding\nand execution of ADB-financed contracts, as well as the sanctions if fraud and corruption are\ndiscovered. MOR, through its inspection bureau, ensures that the Government's policies on\neliminating fraud and corruption are followed. The inspection bureau investigates all complaints\nto detect corrupt practices; action is taken as necessary. ADB is supporting broad governance\nactivities through its TA program. Support for the public procurement law, its standard bidding\ndocuments and implementing regulations (footnote 60), and strengthening the auditing system\n(footnote 68) are examples. In addition, ADB provided support for preparing various economic\nlaws, and construction industry regulations and registration procedures. The Government and\nMOR have indicated their commitment to ADB's Anticorruption Policy.\nG.  The Executing Agency\n1.  Organization\n64. MOR will be the EA responsible for overall project implementation. MOR satisfactorily\ncompleted  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  1)  and  implementation  of  the  Hefei-Xi'an  Railway\n(footnote 2) is progressing on schedule. MOR has extensive exposure to other international\nlenders, such as the World Bank and JBIC, and bilateral assistance from Australia, Austria,\nCanada, and Germany. The internal capacity and the level of transparency are satisfactory. MOR\nhas adequate capacity to fulfill ADB's financial management and reporting requirements, as well\nas anticorruption and corporate governance requirements. MOR will ensure compliance with loan\ndocuments,  report  on  implementation  progress  to  ADB,  and  coordinate  with  Government\norganizations implementing the Project.\n2.  Financial Performance of MOR\n65. MOR's financial statements reflect the consolidation of accounts of individual railway\nadministrations. A projection of MOR's financial performance was prepared for 2002 to 2010,\ntaking  into  consideration  the  investments  planned  during  that  period.  The  results  are\nsummarized in Table 4 and details are given in Appendix 12.", "21\nTable 4: Financial Performance of the Ministry of Railways\n(Y million)\nYear Ending\n31 December 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010\nOperating Revenuea 160,936 180,058 202,133 222,848 245,495\nOperating Expense 108,026 120,195 133,947 149,176 164,766\nOperating Ratio (%) 69.9 69.5 69.0 69.7 69.9\na  Including proceeds of the railway construction fund.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n66. MOR will maintain an operating ratio of not more than 70 percent on its operations\nduring the commercial operation of the GLR. MOR's operating ratio is expected to steadily\nimprove because of revenue growth based on the adjustment of tariffs for inflation, improvement\nin service quality, increase in efficiency, and adoption of market-oriented policies. MOR is\npursuing organizational restructuring and management reforms to increase productivity, reduce\ncosts,  and  improve  operational  efficiency.  Management  contracts  with  the  railway\nadministrations under the assets operation liability system (footnote 16), have improved their\nfinancial  performance.  Establishment  of  passenger  transportation  companies  by  railway\nadministrations  with  more  focus  on  marketing  and  customer  services  will  improve  the\nprofitability  of  passenger  business.  The  divestiture  of  nontransportation  businesses  and\nactivities in 2000 and the improvements in management by applying new tools, such as the\npoint-to-point costing system (footnote 22), the revenue settlement system (footnote 23), and\nthe TMIS (footnote 24) will have beneficial effects on the financial performance of MOR. Given\nthe robustness of MOR's financial base, and the expected positive effects of the ongoing\nreforms,  and  restructuring  and  business  reengineering,  the  financial  performance  of  MOR\nduring 2002-2010 is expected to be satisfactory.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n67. The Project is classified as environmental category A. The overall conclusion of the EIA,\nwhich was confirmed by the TA consultants and the Mission, was that the adverse environmental\nimpacts arising from the construction and operation of the GLR can be appropriately mitigated by\nundertaking  suitable  measures.  The  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring\nprograms included in the Project will ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and\nprocedures of ADB and the Government. A summary EIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of\nDirectors on 29 March 2001. The EIA (in Chinese) was provided to the RCSOs in the counties\ntraversed by the GLR for the information of the public.\n68. Adverse  environmental  impacts  will  be  minimized  by  the  selection  of  an  appropriate\nalignment. The Project was designed to avoid forests and nature preserves, and to minimize the\nacquisition of arable land. The use of bridges and viaducts was favored in lieu of embankments,\nand tunnels in place of cuts. Specifically, the GLR uses extensive tunneling to preserve the forests\nin the project area. The trees to be cut down will be from orchards and secondary woodlands, and\nprimary/old growth forests will be untouched. Adequate buffer zones will be maintained between\nthe railway and environmentally fragile conservation areas. The rare and endangered flora and\nfauna species in both the small animal preserves operated by the forestry department and the\nworld-class Meihuashan nature preserve (which is separated from the railway by a minimum\ndistance of 5 km) will not be adversely affected by the Project. Potential environmental impacts\ninclude those related to tunnel spoil disposal, soil erosion, air pollution, degradation of water", "22\nquality, noise pollution, impairment of aesthetics, disposition of solid wastes, and encroachment\nonto areas set aside to protect plants and wildlife. In each case the stressors that caused the\nimpact,  and  the  receptors,  the  people  and/or  ecosystems  affected,  were  studied.  Wherever\nadverse impacts were identified, comprehensive mitigation measures were specified. A summary\nof the environmental impacts and mitigation measures is presented in Appendix 13.\n69. MOR has assured that the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIA and the\nsummary EIA will be incorporated in the design and construction stages of the Project.69 During\nconstruction  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations  through  their  project\nimplementation offices70 will coordinate with local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) to\nmonitor  the  contractor\u2019s  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  environmental  protection  and\nmonitoring as detailed in the EIA and the summary EIA. Although most of the construction\nworkers will be housed in the cities along the GLR route, monitoring the quality of potable water\nand  sanitation  (i.e.,  wastewater  and  solid  wastes)  in  large  workers\u2019  construction  camps  is\nimportant  for  protecting  the  health  of  both  the  workers  and  the  downstream  users  of  the\nwatercourses. The environmental mitigation and monitoring measures are estimated to cost Y91.2\nmillion ($11 million equivalent), which is included in the project cost estimates.\n70. MOR has engaged the Beijing Oasis Environmental Protection Technology Company\nLimited (BOEPTC) 71 to independently monitor environmental protection and mitigation measures\nand to ensure that all applicable national, provincial, and local environmental laws, regulations\nand guidelines, and standards, as well as ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures on environment will\nbe met during project implementation. BOEPTC is staffed with well-qualified professionals who\nhave experience with the environmental management of similar projects. It will liaise with the\nNanchang and Shanghai railway administrations, the project implementing agencies, EPBs, and\nlocal governments, as necessary.72 Monitoring of such measures will be reported in the quarterly\nprogress reports on project implementation, annual reports on environmental monitoring, and an\nevaluation report one year after completion of construction. MOR will provide these reports to\nADB.\n71. The cheaper transportation provided by GLR will facilitate the sustainable development of\nnatural  resources  and  industries.73  The  Mission  confirmed  that  as  part  of  the  approval\nrequirements for all projects that are likely to have adverse impacts on the environment, a\ncomprehensive EIA will be prepared in compliance with the national environmental laws and\nprovincial regulations.74 The State Environmental Protection Administration and the EPBs have\nassured that all forthcoming projects, including induced activities, will follow the same procedure,\nand that during the construction and operation of such projects the Government's environmental\n                  \n69 MOR will include in the bidding documents and contracts for the civil works the environmental requirements on\nwhich contractors need to take action as specified in the EIA and the summary EIA.\n70 Both railway administrations will strengthen their project implementation offices with environment specialists before\nthe start of construction to provide support on all environmental matters.\n71 BOEPTC is a joint venture enterprise set up by the Environmental Assessment Center of the China Academy of\nRailway Sciences and the Environmental Protection Committee of the China Railway Association. BOEPTC has\nbeen assigned environmental monitoring work for the World Bank-financed Baoji-Lanzhou Railway Project.\n72Before  the  start  of  construction,  BOEPTC  will  familiarize  railway  staff  and  contractors\u2019  personnel  with  the\nenvironmental requirements in the EIA and the summary EIA.\n73 Adverse environmental impacts were minimized in the project areas of previous railway projects (e.g., Jing-Jiu\nRailway). Natural resources were developed and manufacturing industries set up taking advantage of cheaper\nlabor and cheaper transportation compared with motorized transport.\n74 The consultants under TA 3486 (footnote 6) and the Mission reviewed samples of EIAs of natural resource\ndevelopment projects and industrial projects, that were found to be satisfactory. Ganzhou Prefecture confirmed\nthat in the case of developments induced by the Jing-Jiu Railway, environmental impact assessments were\nprepared and appropriate measures were taken to mitigate and minimize adverse environmental effects.", "23\npolicies, laws, and regulations will be followed to ensure minimal adverse environmental impact.75\nReview by the Mission confirmed that the Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations and\nthe  EPBs  possess  adequate  professional  capability  to  manage  environmental  monitoring\nprograms.  They  have  both  the  qualified  personnel  and  the  necessary  facilities  to  monitor\nenvironmental  parameters,  including  ambient  noise,  air,  and  water  conditions,  as  well  as\nconcentrations  of  specific  pollutants.  Consequently,  environmental  impacts  of  induced\ndevelopment projects are expected to be addressed adequately.\n2.  Resettlement\n72. The alignment of the GLR was selected through a combination of (i) technical suitability for\nensuring economic efficiency of project design, (ii) minimizing involuntary resettlement by avoiding\nfarmland  and  urban  areas  wherever  feasible,  and  (iii)  minimizing  environmental  impacts  by\navoiding fragile conservation areas. The design includes tunnels, viaducts, bridges, overpasses,\nand underpasses that reduce the area of land to be acquired as well as the disrupting effects on\nthe local community. The Fourth Survey and Design Institute carried out the detailed specification\nof the alignment and location of stations in consultation with prefecture, county, and township\nofficials and representatives of local farmers. The alignment selected is both socially responsive\nand economically efficient.\n73. The acquisition of land for the construction of the GLR will affect an estimated 19,340\npeople in 4,300 households, including those who will lose land or houses or both. MOR has\nprepared an RP for the affected people based on the land administration laws of the PRC. The\nRP was reviewed and refined by TA consultants and the Mission in accordance with ADB's\nrequirements for involuntary resettlement. It incorporates the results of a socioeconomic sample\nsurvey76  of  affected  households,  and  feedback  from  field  visits  and  meetings  by  the  TA\nconsultants and the Mission with various stakeholders. The RP includes the compensation\nentitlement of affected people based on the nature of their losses. It will also apply to people\nwho might be affected due to land acquisition for station access roads and link roads. Where\nnecessary, affected people, particularly those from poor households and households headed by\nwomen will be given additional assistance as provided by law. Affected people will be relocated\nnear their current location, and communities will not be broken up. The total cost of land\nacquisition and resettlement is estimated at $38 million equivalent and will be financed by MOR.\nThe Government has assured that funds, including cost overruns, will be made available in a\ntimely manner, and that the entitlements specified in the RP will be disclosed and delivered to the\naffected  people.  The  RP  meets  with  ADB's  requirements  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Its\nsummary is given in Appendix 14.\n74. MOR  will  assume  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RP.  The  institutional\nresponsibility for implementing land acquisition and resettlement will rest with the provinces,\nprefectures, and counties traversed by the GLR. MOR will compensate the governments of the\ntwo provinces crossed by the GLR for the costs incurred for resettlement.77 The provinces will\ncompensate the relevant local governments, which deal directly with the affected villages and\npeople. The county land administration bureaus responsible for land acquisition, surveying and\nrecording the amount of land involved, and categorizing land into quality levels, will work jointly\n                  \n75 For violation of environmental laws in respect of wastewater, and dust and gas emissions, about 37 factories and\ntwo mines were closed down in the counties and districts along the GLR.\n76 Under TA 3486, the baseline sample survey covered 600 affected households.\n77 The agreements on land acquisition and compensation between MOR and Fujian and Jiangxi provinces will be the\nbasis for payment of resettlement compensation by MOR.", "24\nwith the RCSOs to set specific compensation values for the land involved. Periodic resettlers\u2019\nmeetings will be held at the local level to discuss the RP, the implementation schedule, and\npolicies and standards of compensation, and to receive feedback from the affected people. Local\nunits of the All China Women\u2019s Federation will participate in this process to ensure that the\ninterests and concerns of women, particularly households headed by women are fully addressed\nunder the Project.\n75. Construction of the 277 km GLR will proceed by contract section. Before the start of\nconstruction in each section, detailed surveying of housing and related residential areas will be\ndone. Public consultation and negotiation with the affected people will be carried out to determine\ncompensation and resettlement locations. The overall schedule for implementation will ensure that\nall affected people will be relocated as well as provided with means of livelihood before the\nconstruction begins. Because of the careful planning and public consultation done,78 no significant\nproblems are envisaged in land acquisition and resettlement implementation. Local officials have\nexperience with resettlement on previous projects notably the Jing-Jiu Railway and the Longyan-\nMeizhou Railway.\n76. On  10  March  2001,  MOR  distributed  copies  of  the  RP  (in  Chinese)  to  the  county\ngovernments and RCSOs for the information of the affected people. In addition MOR prepared\nan information booklet covering the important aspects of the RP, including the Government\u2019s\npolicies, privileges of the affected people, entitlements for compensation, legal rights of affected\npeople, and the system for redress of grievances; it was distributed (on 23 March 2001) to\ntownships and villages along the GLR route for the information of the affected people. The\nRCSOs are responsible for receiving the comments of the affected people and addressing their\nconcerns. MOR will report the progress of land acquisition and resettlement to ADB through the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation. MOR has engaged the Research Institute of\nthe  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  (RI-SJU)79  to  independently  monitor  RP  implementation,\nconduct annual survey updates during resettlement implementation, report on completion of the\nresettlement, and evaluate the resettlement process two years after completion of resettlement.\nMOR will provide RI-SJU's monitoring and evaluation reports to ADB. MOR has given assurance\nthat the resettlement will be completed satisfactorily as per the RP and in accordance with the\nPRC's land administration laws and ADB's resettlement requirements.\n3.  Social Analysis\n77. The detailed social analysis carried out under TA 3486 examined the broader social\ntrends, as well as the needs of people in the project area, and their ability to benefit from the\nProject. Gender issues were taken into account in the analysis. Adequate consultations were\nheld with people living in the project area, including formal and informal interviews and meetings\nwith leaders and residents of local communities as described in the RP, the EIA, and the final\nreport for TA 3486 (footnote 6). The widespread knowledge and information about the Project\namong the people living in the project influence area was confirmed during the Mission\u2019s field\nvisits. The social analysis incorporates the results of a sample household survey in the project\narea  that  provides  a  baseline  for  monitoring  the  impact  of  the  Project  and  associated\ndevelopments.\n                  \n78 The village representatives and households, including households headed by women, met by the Mission were all\naware of and supported the Project. They expressed belief that the Project would provide new employment and\nincome-generating opportunities, and that cheaper transportation on the railway will open distant markets and help\nget better prices for local produce and labor.\n79 RI-SJU is independent of MOR and is staffed by qualified personnel with experience necessary to undertake\nresettlement monitoring. It has undertaken similar assignments satisfactorily on World Bank projects.", "25\n78. About 4.1 million people live in the eight counties/district on the GLR route; 83 percent in\nrural areas. Because of the mountainous terrain, cultivated land is limited and farms are small\nproviding rural families with less than half of their income. Over 20 percent of rural income is from\nwage labor and nearly 30 percent from small business activity. Over 60 percent of farmers\u2019\nhouses are made of traditional earth and wood construction and are relatively small. Primary\neducation is almost universal in the project influence area. Basic health care is generally available.\nWater supplies are mostly safe, except in Changting County; but running water is quite rare. Out\nof eight counties/district (footnote 49), except Ganxian County at the west end and Xinlou District\nat the east end, the remaining six intermediate counties that do not have railway service at\npresent comprise the main impact area of the GLR. Ganxian County and Xinluo District which\nhave existing railway service, will also benefit.\n79. The project area is rich in natural resources (i.e., metallic ores, limestone, coal, granite,\nand forests), but lack of economic transport has limited the sustainable development of natural\nresources and associated industry.80 Without railway transport, many of these assets will remain\nunderdeveloped. Local governments are providing incentives to promote investments that will\nbenefit from the externalities arising from the Project.\n80. The Project will have major direct and indirect social and poverty reduction impacts that\nsignificantly strengthen its justification. Formulation of the Project has sought to maximize positive\nsocial impacts, and avoid and mitigate the negative ones. During the early stages of project\ndesign and preparation, continuous publicity on radio and television and in the newspapers\nensured that the people living along the line became familiar with the main features of the Project.\nIn the course of fieldwork for the feasibility study and the EIA, and during the study under TA\n3486,  the  Fourth  Survey  and  Design  Institute  and  the  TA  consultants  carried  out  intensive\ndialogue with local government officials, representatives of townships and villages, and local\nresidents on the choice of the alignment as well as resettlement options. Questionnaires were\ndistributed to many local citizens to solicit their opinion on the Project. The Mission visited villages\nalong the GLR route and interviewed a selection of local residents to assess the socioeconomic\nsituation and awareness of the Project among local people. A list of those who participated in the\npublic consultations at various stages of project preparation is given in Appendix 15.81 The\nimplementation strategy focuses on the participation of local people to improve the distribution of\nbenefits to them. Local people consulted during the Mission's field visit supported the Project and\nbelieve that the railway will provide employment and income-generating opportunities that will\nimprove their standard of living.\n81. In conjunction with the Project, local governments are pursuing the objective of poverty\nreduction through (i) market-based agriculture, (ii) microurbanization,82 and (iii) development of\ninland areas. Local governments have initiated a number of programs for increasing rural incomes\nby growing cash crops for markets. A shift to market-based agriculture is dependent on the\navailability of cost-effective transport that will be provided by the Project. A summary of the\ndevelopment programs initiated by local governments is given in Appendix 16. A reduction of the\nrural population through microurbanization will increase the per capita availability of the cultivated\nland among the rural people. Consequently, rural incomes will increase. Local governments are\n                  \n80 The natural resources to be moved are bulky in nature with relatively low commodity value in relation to weight and\nvolume making trucks inefficient as transportation providers.\n81 This list is indicative only, and exhaustive details of public consultation (other than those covered in the sample\nsurvey \u2013 footnote 76) are available in the feasibility study, EIA, summary EIA, and the TA consultant's final report.\n82 Under the microurbanization program, new urban centers will be developed targeted at reducing the rural\npopulation from 73 percent to 50 percent.", "26\ndeveloping urban centers along the GLR with associated programs for industrialization. The\ncheaper transportation provided by the GLR will facilitate access of farmers to markets outside\ntheir immediate communities.\n82. The social analysis indicates that no negative gender impacts will be associated with the\nconstruction and operation of the GLR. GLR construction, and the activities induced by it, will\nemploy  local  labor  at  a  wage  rate  of  about  Y20  per  day.  Given  the  extent  of  rural\nunderemployment, the demand for local labor will increase worker productivity and wages. The\nPRC law gives equal rights to women in employment. Labor-absorbing growth and the resulting\nexpansion  in  employment  opportunities  in  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  will  bring  many\nwomen into the workforce. The wages paid to women who are provided employment will increase\nfamily incomes. Prefecture and county representatives of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation will\ntake part in resettlement implementation and advise on wider social and economic development\nimpacts on women. The Project provides opportunities for gender-related employment grievances\nto be redressed. The rise in female participation in the workplace during GLR construction and\noperation and the increase in women\u2019s income, will have important consequences for poverty\nreduction and improving the status of women. When monitoring and evaluating the Project\u2019s\nsocioeconomic benefits, special attention will be given to households headed by women. The\nGovernment and MOR will ensure that ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development83 is followed.\n4. Indigenous People\n83. Along the GLR route, the only known ethnic minority with a significant population is the\nShe community, found mainly in Shanghang County, and in some contiguous mountain areas.\nThe She account for 90 percent of about 59,000 minority people living in the eight counties/district\ntraversed by the GLR. Minority people comprise less than 1.4 percent of the total population of 4.1\nmillion. The She are economically and socially integrated and are not disadvantaged with respect\nto their cultural and economic position, nor are they likely to be disproportionately affected by the\nProject on account of their cultural identity. No special measures are needed for them. Small\nnumbers of at least 17 other minority nationalities live in the project influence area. Most live there\nbecause of intermarriage with the Han people. These people are also fully integrated into the\nmainstream and are not disadvantaged.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. Financial Analysis\n84. Based on the policy dialogue under the Project, MOR will set GLR tariffs under the new\nline, new tariff policy at full cost recovery,84 while ensuring economy and efficiency of operation.\nThe  Project's  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  6.4  percent,  based  on  an\nassumed freight tariff of Y0.2143 per ton-km85 and unit passenger revenue of Y0.113 per\npassenger-km, (Appendix 17). The proposed level of freight tariff is competitive compared with\n                  \n83 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. Manila.\n84 Considering operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service charges in excess of depreciation, taxes,\nand a reasonable profit.\n85 This compares with a freight tariff of Y0.0791 per ton-km on the national network, Y0.16 per ton-km on the\nMeizhou-Kanshi Railway, and Y0.15 per ton-km on the Baotou-Shenmu Railway and Hefei-Jiujiang Railway.\nBecause of socioeconomic and affordability considerations, the passenger tariff was assumed to be the same as\nfor the national network.", "27\nthe cost of motorized transport of Y0.70 per ton-km. The projected level of traffic and tariffs will\nresult in sufficient revenues to fully meet the project costs under the full cost recovery policy.\nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  has  robust  financial  viability  since  the  financial\ninternal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 3.4 percent in the tested\nadverse scenarios. Tariffs to be applied on the GLR will be based on a tariff study to be carried\nout by MOR before the start of commercial operation. This study will consider various tariff\nalternatives and analyze the impact of the proposed tariff on traffic demand. The results of this\nstudy will be provided to ADB.\n2. Economic Analysis\n85. The scope of economic evaluation includes financial evaluation, link roads, and station\naccess roads. The economic internal rate of return was calculated by comparing the with and\nwithout GLR scenarios. The benefits from the GLR comprise (i) benefits derived from freight and\npassenger transport such as operating cost savings, time savings, and net economic value\nadded through additional production that would occur consequent to GLR construction; (ii)\nbenefits associated with link roads and station access roads such as vehicle operating cost\nsavings and net economic value added due to station area development attributed to the GLR;\n(iii) avoided road rehabilitation and maintenance costs for the existing highways; (iv) avoided\nfatality costs on the existing roads; and (v) incremental tourism benefits from spending by\ntourists attributed to the GLR. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 14.4\npercent  (Appendix  17).  The  Project  remains  economically  viable  in  the  tested  adverse\nscenarios.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n1. Poverty in the Project Area\n86. Of the eight counties/district traversed by the GLR, six counties are officially designated\npoverty counties. Lack of economic transport has been one of the major reasons why this region\nwas bypassed and remained poor. In 2000 the incidence of poverty in the project influence area\nwas 21 percent compared with 12 percent in the PRC as a whole. The main cause of poverty is\ninsufficient opportunity for earning income, insufficient arable land, and lack of skills.86 Job\nopportunities are scarce, especially those that do not require displacement to a far-off part of the\ncountry. Jobs created within the project influence area allow the family member to maintain ties\nand nonmonetary responsibility to family at the same time. They also bring revenue to the\ncommunity for reinvestment either to generate economic development and jobs or to invest in\nthe longer term needs, i.e., education, health care, and the cultural life of local people. The\nsmall size of the cultivated land allocated per family is not enough to gainfully employ all\nhousehold members. Therefore, at least one family member seeks wage employment to meet\nthe basic needs and improve the standard of living of the family. Data from the household\nsurvey shows that families with higher dependence on agricultural activities are the poorer\nfamilies, and those that have risen above the poverty line are getting a larger share of their\nincome from wage earning and running small businesses on a commercial basis.\n                  \n86 Poverty reduction efforts in the past have highlighted the importance of access to markets, availability of cost\neffective means to transport raw materials and products to market, training, and new technologies for developing\ncash crops and increasing farm production.", "28\n2. Impact on Poverty\n87. The Project will have direct effects on poverty reduction by providing employment and\nincome-generating  opportunities  to  poor  people  during  the  five-year  construction  period.\nCheaper  railway  transportation  facilitated  by  the  Project  will  induce  sustainable  economic\nactivity as evidenced under previous railway projects. The induced activities will have significant\nimpacts on the people in the project influence area and help to reduce poverty. A detailed\npoverty impact analysis that demonstrates the impacts on poverty reduction of both the Project\nand the developments induced by it is presented in Appendix 18.\na. Impacts During Construction\n88. A detailed assessment of the employment created during the construction and operation\nof the GLR was carried out under TA 3486. Each construction contractor will be required to hire\nat  least  half  of  the  unskilled  labor  required  for  the  project  construction  works  from  poor\nhouseholds. During construction, a large quantity of materials (such as sand and stone) will be\nobtained from poor villages.87 For materials that are locally produced, at least 30 percent of the\nunskilled labor requirement will likely be met by poor households. Access and link roads to be\nconstructed by local governments will create new employment, half of which will be availed of by\npoor households.88 Operation of the GLR will require about 2,500 staff. No new staff will be hired\nbut surplus staff from the national network will be relocated to operate the GLR, in pursuance of\nMOR\u2019s policy of reducing excess staff. To load and unload freight wagons and to work as\nsecurity guards at stations and warehouses, the GLR will hire contract labor, 70 percent of who\nwill be sourced from poor households.\nb. Impacts of Induced Developments\n89. The project area is rich in natural resources, including metallic ores, minerals, and forest\nresources.  Low  cost  transport  provided  by  the  GLR  will  facilitate  sustainable  industrial\ndevelopment in the project influence area. Poverty reduction programs by local governments will\nfoster  technical  skills,  managerial  expertise,  and  financial  means  needed  to  add  value  to\nprocessing industries. The Project will stimulate economic development that will enable poor\nhouseholds to increase income, raise their standard of living, and decrease their vulnerability to\neconomic and social adversities. It will also increase the revenue base for local governments,\nwhich can be used to increase expenditures on social services. These outcomes have been\ndemonstrated in the previous railway projects, particularly the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 1).\n90. Before  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  was  constructed,  lack  of  economic  transportation  in\nGanzhou Prefecture constrained development and this region remained less developed and\npoor.89 In the aftermath of the Jing-Jiu Railway the economic development of western Ganzhou\naccelerated.  During  the  five-year  operation  of  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  since  1996,  the  major\neconomic impacts in Ganzhou Prefecture were (i) GDP growth averaged 10.1 percent per year,\n                  \n87 During the field survey by the Fourth Survey and Design Institute, local availability of materials that meet the\nrequired quality standards was ascertained.\n88 During the Mission\u2019s field visit, local governments supported the special measures under the Project to provide\nemployment to poor households. The Mission was assured that lists of poor households in the villages along the\nGLR will be made available to the contractors for hiring poor workers. Similar measures were implemented\nsuccessfully on previous infrastructure projects.\n89 The Jing-Jiu Railway traverses 262 km in the western part of Ganzhou Prefecture across 7 counties (i.e., Xingguo,\nGanxian, Zhanggong, Nankang, Xinfeng, Longnan, and Dingnan), 33 townships, and 133 villages.", "29\nexceeding the national and provincial growth rates of 8.3 percent and 9.8 percent;90 (ii) 387\nforeign-financed projects (with total investment of Y503 million), and 3,271 domestic-financed\nprojects  (with  total  investment  of  Y8,560  million)  were  set  up,  which  was  15  times  the\ninvestment  during  the  previous  five  years  (1991-1995);  (iii)  new  and  expanded  industries\nprovided employment to 395,000 people, including 186,000 poor people; (iv) during 1995-2000\nthe change in the economy was dramatic, with the tertiary sector improving its share in GDP at\nthe expense of the primary and secondary sectors;91 (v) productivity and demand for labor along\nthe Jing-Jiu Railway increased, increasing worker\u2019s wages from Y3,775 in 1995 to Y6,190 in\n2000; (vi) the total number of poor people in two national poverty counties (i.e. Xingguo and\nGanxian) was reduced from 283,650 in 1995 to 240,000 in 2000;92 (vii) access to wider markets\nencouraged  production  of  cash  crops  (such  as  fruits  and  vegetables),  livestock,  poultry,\nfloriculture, and agro-based industry;93 (viii) a total of 10 million passengers and 8 million tons of\nfreight were transported, or an average annual increase of 36.5 percent and 65.6 percent,\nrespectively; (ix) business and commercial activity was stimulated; at the end of 2000, Ganzhou\nhad 178,000 self-owned businesses and 5,086 private enterprises employing a total of 561,000\npeople;94  the  annual  industrial  and  commercial  tax  income  from  individual  self-owned\nbusinesses  was  Y610  million,  accounting  for  about  30  percent  of  the  budget  revenue  of\nGanzhou  Prefecture;  the  revenues  of  county  governments  also  grew;95  and  (x)  tourism\ndeveloped rapidly; in 2000, Ganzhou received 4.6 million tourists (including 37,700 foreign\ntourists) or about 20 percent of the total visitors to Jiangxi Province.96\n91. The study under TA 3486 showed that the GLR will facilitate significant expansion of\nexisting industrial and commercial activity in the region. The study identified 33 specific economic\ndevelopment  opportunities  that  were  directly  attributable  to  the  GLR,  including  sustainable\ndevelopment of natural resources, agricultural processing, microurbanization, and tourism. For\nexample the Fujian Minxi Zijin Mining Industry Group, a public-private joint venture, owns a copper\nore deposit of 200 million tons near Longyan that can be economically developed using low cost\nrailway transportation. This activity will create about 6,000 new jobs, including 2,400 jobs for local\n                  \n90 In the project influence area of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway (footnote 1), which includes seven counties, the GDP per\ncapita during the construction period (1992-1997) increased by an average 20 percent per annum.\n91 The percentage share of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors in GDP was 34.7:29.3:36 in 2000 compared with\n44.3:30.2:25.5 in 1995.\n92 In seven counties in the project influence area of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway, the number of poor persons was\nreduced from 834,926 in 1992 (before the project) to 493,264 in 1997 (after the project). In two districts traversed\nby the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 1) the number of poor people was reduced from 347,520 in 1992\n(before the project) to 56,318 in 1996 (after the project).\n93Along the Jing-Jiu Railway a number of products, as for example, salted duck from Ganxian County, sweet\ngrapefruit from Nankang, navel orange and straw mushroom from Xifeng, gray goose from Xingguo, have been\npromoted. The total area of orchards increased to 110,000 ha, with total yield of 350,000 tons. Nearly 1,000 firms\nfocusing on processing and marketing of agriculture products have been set up. The Southern Jiangxi Fruit\nIndustry Company Limited, with daily processing capacity of 160 tons of fresh fruits, is listed on the stock market.\nAgro-products are being supplied to more than 20 inland provinces, cities and districts, and exported to Japan,\nPakistan and other Asian countries.\n94The rapid development of self-owned businesses promoted the development of large-scale commodity markets.\nOver 600 trading markets with a total area of 2.36 million square meters and business volume of Y125 million have\nbeen set up. Ganxian County has attracted Y280 million to build the Gannan Guangcai Market at the Ganzhou\neast freight railway station in an area of 6.67 ha, with 1,200 shops and employing more than 3,700 people and an\nannual revenue of Y10 billion. At Dingnan County, 12 production bases of agricultural by-products, such as piglets,\npears, and nonseasonal vegetables have been set up with a sales network extending to Shanghai, Guangzhou,\nand Beijing.\n95 In the project influence area of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway (footnote 1) the revenue of the seven counties increased\nby an average 30 percent per year from 1992 (before the project) to 1997 (after the project).\n96 After completion of the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway (footnote 1) tourism to the project influence area doubled every\nyear because of the safety, comfort, and connectivity provided by the railway.", "30\npeople. Two existing cement plants in Yudu, two in Liancheng, and one each in Huichang, Ruijin,\nChangting, and Shanghang will expand their manufacturing capacity with the construction of the\nGLR. As a result 3,300 additional jobs will be created. The GLR will enhance the competitiveness\nof 10 granite mining enterprises in Changting County. These will create 180 additional jobs. In the\narea of agriculture-related development, the existing Liancheng sweet potato processing plant\n(capacity 80,000 tons) will be expanded by 50 percent, creating 700 new jobs. Both Yudu and\nLongyan poverty reduction offices are planning to expand the production of green plums, forestry\nproducts, and other cash crops following the Liancheng example. The GLR will provide a synergy\nfor speeding up the Government's microurbanization program, which has targeted development of\nindustrial and commercial activity at six GLR stations. Under this program a shoe manufacturing\nfacility is planned to be set up at Xijiang, which will create an estimated 2,500 jobs.\n92. The employment effects of induced developments estimated on the basis of freight traffic\ngenerated by the GLR from production in new industries and expansion of existing industries97\nare summarized in Table 5.\nTable 5: Employment Impact of the Ganzhou-Longyan Railway\nand Induced Developments\n(person-years)\nTotal Employment Employment for Poor\nCreated Households\nType of Employment Construction Operation Construction Operation\n(Unskilled) 2002 to 2006 2007 to 2026 2002 to 2006 2007 to 2026\nDirect\nConstruction of GLR 76,020 \u2014 38,010 \u2014\nGLR operation (MOR staff) \u2014  49,380 \u2014 \u2014\nLoading/Unloading \u2014 103,360 \u2014 72,350\nSecurity guards \u2014    1,280 \u2014 900\nIndirect\nGLR induced jobs (generated \u2014 734,020 \u2014 293,610\ntraffic)\nMaterials sourced locally 20,230 \u2014 6,150 \u2014\nAccess and link roads 3,320 \u2014 1,660 \u2014\n   Rest of the PRC 10,070 \u2014 1,200 \u2014\nTotal 109,640 888,040 47,020 366,860\n\u2014=not applicable, GLR=Ganzhou-Longyan Railway, MOR=Ministry of Railways, PRC=People's Republic of China.\nSource: TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project. Final Report, February 2001.\n93. During the five-year construction period, the Project will generate about 109,600 person-\nyears of unskilled employment, of which about 47,000 person-years will be provided to the poor.\nDuring operation, incremental production attributable to the GLR will result in 20,100 person-\nyears of employment in 2007 increasing to 60,000 person-years in 2026. Therefore during the\n20 years from 2007 to 2026, a total of 734,000 person-years of employment will be created.\nAssuming that about 40 percent98 of the new employment will go to poor households, a total of\n294,000 person-years of employment would be passed on to poor people during 2007 to 2026.\n                  \n97 The generated traffic and employment created were estimated in the study under TA 3486. The study provides a\nlist of main industrial and mineral enterprises that would be heavily impacted by the GLR. The benefits from\ninduced developments are not included in the financial and economic analyses of the Project.\n98 Based on the incidence of poverty in areas close to the GLR route as per the sample household survey.", "31\nc. Distribution Analysis\n94. The financial and economic analyses have been integrated through a distribution analysis\nthat disaggregates the net financial and economic benefits to various beneficiaries. The impact on\nthe poor was measured by quantifying the direct benefits that would accrue to poor people from\nthe Project. The proportion of total benefits passed on to poor people was determined as the\npoverty impact ratio of the Project, and evaluated as 26 percent (Appendix 17).\n95. The poverty impact ratio compares favorably with the national poverty incidence of 12\npercent. It does not capture the indirect benefits that would accrue to the poor from the economic\ngrowth, higher incomes, and better living standards from the Project. If these were also included,\nthe benefits accruing to the poor would be substantial. The impact of the Project and induced\ndevelopments  as  well  as  local  programs  for  poverty  reduction  will  be  monitored  by  local\ngovernments, RI-SJU, and MOR under the project performance management system (Appendix\n11) and reported to ADB through the periodic and annual monitoring reports.\nC.  Risks\n96. The Project was designed to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous\nrailway projects, traffic demand was conservatively estimated. The forecast for freight traffic was\nadjusted  in  the  initial  years  of  operation  based  on  generally  slower  growth  experienced  on\nprevious railway projects. Sensitivity tests have shown that economic circumstances must turn\nsubstantially adverse for the Project to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in\nimplementation,  which  would  delay  the  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  and  both  railway\nadministrations have successfully built railway lines over difficult terrain, such as the Nanning-\nKunming Railway, the Jing-Jiu Railway, and the Meizhou-Kanshi Railway. The support that the\nProject has from the Government, MOR, and the provinces; the thorough preparation of the\nProject; and the approval of advance procurement action, all contribute to reducing the potential\nrisk of delays in implementation. The major environmental risks will be mitigated and monitored\nduring  project  implementation.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  may  be  a  potential  risk.\nConsidering that these activities have been well planned, have the support of MOR and the two\nprovinces on the GLR route, are adequately budgeted in the project cost estimates, and will be\nimplemented  by  experienced  provincial  and  the  local  governments,  the  potential  risk  of\nresettlement problems is considered low.\n97. For  a  project  generating  revenue  in  domestic  currency,  exchange  rate  changes\nconstitute a risk. Since the share of foreign exchange in the total cost is only 33 percent, the\nforeign  exchange  risk  is  not  significant.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  the  Project  will  be\nfinancially viable even with depreciation of the yuan by as much as 30 percent. The risk of\nunderachievement  of  the  expected  poverty  reduction  impact  if  employment  and  income\ngeneration opportunities do not accrue to the poor has been mitigated by the strong commitment\nof the Government, MOR, the two provinces, and the local governments to poverty reduction in\nthe project influence area.", "32\nVI.  ASSURANCES\n98. The  Government  and  MOR  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Connecting  Railway  Lines.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  connected  railway\nimprovements on the Longyan-Zhangping line and expansion of yards at the\nterminals of the project railway are completed in a timely manner.\n(ii)  Construction  Quality.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  GLR  is  constructed  in\naccordance with national technical standards, and that construction supervision,\nquality control, and contract management are performed satisfactorily.\n(iii)  Counterpart Financing. MOR will provide, on a timely basis, all funds and\nresources necessary for construction, and operation and maintenance of the\nGLR. MOR will cover any project cost overruns.\n(iv)  Environment. MOR will ensure that the GLR is constructed and operated in\naccordance with the national environmental laws and provincial regulations, and\nmeets ADB guidelines and procedures for the environment. MOR will also ensure\nthat any adverse environmental impacts arising from construction and operation\nof  the  GLR  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  and\nmonitoring the program recommended in the EIA and the summary EIA. MOR,\ntogether with the provincial and county EPBs, will ensure that the station access\nand link roads are constructed in accordance with the national environmental\nrequirements. BOEPTC will carry out environmental monitoring in accordance with\nthe EIA and the summary EIA. The results of environmental monitoring will be\nreported  by  MOR  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation, annual reports on environmental monitoring, and an evaluation\nreport one year after completion of construction. The Government through Fujian\nand Jiangxi provinces will ensure that any project-induced economic activities,\nparticularly  mining  and  industrial  developments,  will  undergo  appropriate\nenvironmental assessment and review under the national laws and provincial\nregulations,  and  any  adverse  environmental  impact  will  be  appropriately\nmitigated.\n(v)  Financial  Performance  and  Tariffs.  MOR  will  monitor  the  operational\nperformance of the GLR on the basis of agreed indicators of physical operation\nand MOR's financial performance; the results of such monitoring will be provided\nto ADB for the first five full years of GLR operation within nine months after the\nend of the fiscal year. The Government and MOR will ensure that the tariffs are\nset  at  levels  sufficient  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and\nmaintenance costs, depreciation, debt service, taxes, and a reasonable profit. Six\nmonths prior to opening the GLR for commercial traffic, MOR will carry out a tariff\nstudy to determine the tariffs to be applied. This study will be provided to ADB.\nMOR  will  maintain  an  operating  ratio  of  not  more  than  70  percent  on  its\noperations during the commercial operation of the GLR.", "33\n(vi)  Gender  and  Development.  MOR  will  follow  and  cause  Fujian  and  Jiangxi\nprovinces to follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development, and will take all\nnecessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in\nimplementing the Project. MOR, with the help of RI-SJU, and in consultation with\nthe local representatives of the All-China Women\u2019s Federation, will monitor the\nProject's effects on women through gender-disaggregated data.\n(vii)  Industrial Sidings. MOR will ensure that potential major shippers along the GLR\nwill be encouraged and assisted as necessary to construct and operate industrial\nsidings.\n(viii)  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. MOR will ensure that all land and rights-\nof-way required for the Project are made available in a timely manner. MOR,\nunder arrangements with Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, will ensure that the RP is\ncarried out promptly and efficiently in line with the PRC Land Administration Law\n1998, the provincial guidelines on land acquisition and resettlement, and ADB\u2019s\npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  MOR  will  ensure  that  all  persons  are\ncompensated and assisted prior to displacement from their houses, land, and\nassets in accordance with the RP such that they are at least as well off as they\nwould have been in the without Project scenario. The Government will ensure\nthat funds for land acquisition and resettlement are provided as scheduled in the\nRP and meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the cost estimate. The\nGovernment, through Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, will ensure that, for station\naccess and link roads, the provinces will provide the same compensation and\nassistance  as  set  out  in  the  RP.  MOR  will  ensure  that  RI-SJU  carries  out\nindependent  monitoring  and  regular  reporting  during  resettlement\nimplementation,  and  evaluates  resettlement  achievement  two  years  after\ncompletion. Monitoring and evaluation will include annual survey updates during\nresettlement implementation as required in the RP. MOR will report to ADB on\nthe progress of land acquisition and resettlement through quarterly progress\nreports, and a report to be submitted on completion of the resettlement, and two\nyears thereafter.\n(ix)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOR  will  monitor  the  Project's  performance\nthrough  the  project  performance  management  system  to  ensure  that  the\nobjective of poverty reduction is achieved and the project facilities are managed\nefficiently. MOR will collect the necessary information on project performance as\nagreed to by ADB.\n(x)  Poverty Reduction. Through appropriate stipulations in the contracts, MOR will\nensure that subject to satisfying the requirements of suitability and economy (a)\nhalf of the total requirement of unskilled labor for the construction of the project\nfacilities will be hired from poor households, and (b) local materials that meet the\nrequirements of quality and economy will be arranged by contractors from poor\nvillages.  The  Government  will  cause  Fujian  and  Jiangxi  provinces  and  the\ncontractors to implement the poverty reduction programs in the project area, and\nprovide half the unskilled jobs for the construction of station access roads and\nlink roads to poor households. MOR will monitor the impacts on poverty with the\nhelp of RI-SJU. MOR will provide to ADB annual monitoring reports of RI-SJU\nand an evaluation report to be submitted two years after the start of operation.\n ", "34\n(xi)  Railway  Operation.  MOR  through  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway\nadministrations will ensure (a) efficient and economic management, day-to-day\noperation, and repair and maintenance of the GLR; (b) provision of an adequate\nnumber of trained staff and resources to meet the GLR's operational needs; and\n(c)  provision  of  sufficient  rolling  stock  (locomotives,  freight  wagons,  and\npassenger cars) to meet the demand for transportation on the GLR. MOR will\nensure  the  safety  of  passengers  and  freight  in  accordance  with  the  PRC\u2019s\nRailway Law.\n(xii)  Station Access and Link Roads. The Government will cause Fujian and Jiangxi\nprovinces to take all measures to construct the station access and link roads in a\ntimely manner to maximize the benefits of economic transport to the poor.\n(xiii)  Worker Safety and Health. MOR will ensure that measures are taken to ensure\nthe  safety  of  workers  during  construction,  and  contractors  disseminate\ninformation on the risks of socially transmitted diseases to those employed during\nconstruction.\nVII.

Introduction\n1. The Ministry of Railways (MOR), the Executing Agency, is implementing the Ganzhou-\nLongyan  Railway  (GLR)  Project  that  will  link  Ganzhou  in  southern  Jiangxi  Province  with\nLongyan in western Fujian Province. The objective of the Project is to promote sustainable\neconomic growth by enhancing transportation capability in a less accessible and mountainous\nregion, create employment and income-enhancing opportunities, and raise incomes and reduce\npoverty. To achieve this objective, induced developments such as value-added and labor-\nintensive industries need to be facilitated to the project area. The construction of the GLR will\ncreate the conditions for a significant number of companies to invest in the area. From the\nfinancial perspective of the GLR, it is the industry on the route of the GLR that will generate the\ngreater proportion of the traffic. To capture the potential for economic development and traffic in\nthe region and foster railway-local industry cooperation, institutional strengthening in railway\nmarket development will be necessary. The purpose of the consulting services will be to assist\nthe railway in defining what the service should be, plan its future operation, and assist in\ncreating appropriate customer-oriented services for the GLR and the connection to Xiamen Port.\nThe  consulting  services  will  review  the  impact  on  the  railway  sector  of  the  country\u2019s\ncommitments for accession to the World Trade Organization.\nB.  Scope\n2. The scope of the consulting services will include the following.\n1.  Part A\n3. The consultants will (i) determine the level of industry and market development expertise\nin  the  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations;  (ii)  determine  the  programs  and\nincentives available for attracting industry at the county, prefecture, and province levels; (iii)\nmeet with a selection of potential shippers located or planning to locate along the route of the\nGLR; (iv) meet with officials of Xiamen Port and the railway serving the port, to determine\ncurrent operations and future inland transport requirements; (v) develop plans for improving\nrailway services, in particular intermodal services; (vi) propose measures to develop industrial\nsidings; (vii) develop a plan for supplying special purpose wagons to attract industry to the\nproject area; and (viii) improve marketing of railway services to industries, specifically for the\nGLR and Xiamen Port.\n4. The consulting services will develop suitable training programs in the country and a\nforeign country where successful industrial and railway marketing programs are in place. The\nforeign training program will be for eight key railway staff, four from MOR and two each from the\nNanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations.  The  trainees  will  specifically  study  the\nfollowing: (i) operating intermodal container services, with specific attention to intermodal hubs\nand dedicated container trains; (ii) serving shippers directly with industrial sidings as well as\ntracks to industrial parks; (iii) economics and financing of special purpose wagons; (iv) overall\nrailway  operation  in  Xiamen  Port  with  particular  reference  to  bulk  transportation  of  grain,\ncement, sugar, and other products that are applicable to the GLR and the port; (v) developing\nindustries and the various approaches to attracting industries to locate along the railway; and\n(vi) marketing of railway services to potential shippers.", "49\nAppendix 9, page 2\n2.  Part B\n5. Under the country\u2019s commitments for accession to the World Trade Organization, foreign\ninvestors would be able to (i) acquire minority shareholding in joint ventures for freight services\nafter the PRC's accession to the WTO, (ii) acquire majority shareholding within three years\nthereafter, and (iii) set up solely foreign-owned companies within another three years. This\ntransition needs to be factored in to future restructuring of the national railway. The consulting\nservices will evaluate the existing competitive strengths and weaknesses of the national railway\nin the light of imminent entry of foreign operators in the rail freight transport market. Strategic\noptions for railway administrations, including establishing partnerships with foreign operators will\nbe identified. Possible benefits and risks of railway administration-foreign operator partnerships\nwill  be  analyzed  and  measures  will  be  recommended  for  mitigating  risks.  The  consulting\nservices  will  evaluate  the  implications  to  the  competitiveness  and  financial  viability  of  the\nnational railway of allowing majority and eventually full foreign ownership of railway freight\noperation. Considering these and other competitive developments, the consulting services will\npropose  various  institutional,  operating,  and  technical  options,  while  evaluating  alternative\nstructural  reforms.  The  consulting  services  will  evaluate  the  implications  of  the  country\u2019s\naccession to the World Trade Organization on the railway sector, and propose measures for\nmaximizing the benefits of foreign operator entry into the railway freight transport market.\nC.  Expertise and Cost Estimates\n6. About  eight  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consultants\nwill have expertise in industrial development and marketing, international trade, and railway\noperation. The loan will finance the services of international consultants and the cost of foreign\ntraining of key railway staff for a total of eight staff-months.\n7. MOR will (i) assign appropriate counterpart staff to liaise with and facilitate the work of\nconsulting services; (ii) provide suitable office accommodation and communication facilities\ncommensurate with the requirement; (iii) assist the consultants in scheduling field visits and\ndiscussions with field agencies in connection with the study; and (iv) provide all facilities,\ndocumentation, and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the consultants to complete\nthe work.", "50\nAppendix 10\nSTATION ACCESS AND LINK ROADS\nLength Cost\nCounty/Location (km) ($ million)\nA.

The financial performance of the Ganzhou-Longyan Railway (GLR) and the Ministry of\nRailways  (MOR)  were  prepared  at  current  prices  reflecting  the  forecast  domestic  and\ninternational  inflation1  from  2002  onward  and  assumed  currency  fluctuation.  The  main\nassumptions  for  the  financial  statements  are  as  follows:  (i)  freight  tariff,  including  railway\nconstruction fund (RCF) surcharge, are assumed to remain constant in real terms; unit freight\nrevenue was assumed lower than the nominal freight tariff due to reduced tariffs applicable to\nsome commodities; (ii) unit passenger revenue is taken at 50 percent higher than the nominal\ntariff for hard seat because of additional charges for value-added services such as higher\nspeed, air-conditioning, and soft and sleeper seats; and passenger revenue was assumed to\nannually increase in real terms by 5 percent up to 2006 and 1.5 percent thereafter for value-\nadded services;2 (iii) working expenses are assumed to increase according to domestic inflation,\nand traffic volume and real increase were assumed in line with the historical trend of each cost\ncomponent between 1992 and 1999; (iv) annual depreciation expenses are computed based on\neach  asset\u2019s  economic  life;  and  (v)  financial  expenses  are  calculated  based  on  assumed\ninterest rate and outstanding borrowings; business tax of 3.24 percent on the gross revenue;\nand income tax of 33 percent on profit before tax that exceeds the accumulated loss.\n2.  The financial statements of the GLR (Table A12.1) were prepared on a pro-forma basis\nfor 10 years from 2002 to 2011 according to the assumed financing plan, terms and conditions,\nconstruction schedule, revenue based on the forecast traffic, tariff, and the estimated costs.\nAnnual asset revaluation is assumed. Sufficient cash flow and sound operations3 are forecast\nfor the project life.\n3.  The financial statements of MOR (Table A12.2) include actual figures from 1997 to 1999\nand  tentative  figures  for  2000,  and  consider  MOR\u2019s  investment  plan,  and  are  adjusted  to\ninternational accounting practices. These were based on the following additional assumptions:\n(i) staff reduction is assumed at 0.75 percent per year to result in 21.6 employees per route-km\nat the end of 2010 compared with 34 and 25.6 in 1997 and 1999; (ii) freight and passenger\ntraffic are assumed to grow annually by 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively; (iii) no capital\ninfusion  or  subsidy  by  the  Government  is  assumed;  (iv)  nominal  freight  tariff  for  2001  is\nassumed  at  Y0.0791  per  ton-km,  including  Y0.33  per  ton-km  of  railway  construction  fund\nsurcharge and the assumed unit passenger revenue for 2001 is Y0.0875 per passenger-km,4 or\n49 percent more than the hard seat rate; (v) annual net profits derived from the enterprises\nunder the diversified economy program are assumed based on the net return on assets of the\nenterprises; (vi) the divestment of nontransportation entities in September 2000 is reflected as\nestimates, which would reduce losses in nonoperating expenses from 2001 onward; and (vii)\ninterest rates for domestic and foreign loans are assumed at 6.2 percent and 6.5 percent per\nyear with repayment period of 12 years and 20 years, respectively.\n                                                          \n1 Domestic inflation is assumed at 2.5 percent for 2002, 3 percent for 2003, 3.3 percent from 2004 to 2006, and to\nvary from 3.5 percent to 2.2 percent between 2007 and 2026. International inflation is forecast at 2 percent for\n2002, 2.2 percent for 2003, 2.3 percent for 2004, 2.4 percent from 2005 to 2008, and to vary from 2.3 percent to 2\npercent between 2009 and 2026.\n2 The historical trend of annual real increase of passenger unit revenue was approximately 5 percent since 1996.\n3  Average and minimum debt service coverage ratio for the first 10 years are 1.6 and 1.2, respectively, and operating\nratio for 20 years is 51.8 percent on average. These indicators are sustainable in the tested adverse scenarios.\n4 The latest applicable nominal freight tariff per ton-km since July 2000 was Y0.0791, including Y0.033 of RCF\nsurcharge, and

Introduction\n1. The 277 km Ganzhou-Longyan Railway (GLR) will traverse eight counties/district in two\nprefectures  (Ganzhou  and  Longyan)  in  southern  Jiangxi  and  western  Fujian.1  For  the\nconstruction  of  the  GLR,  1,017  hectares  (ha)  will  be  acquired  for  the  right-of-way,  yards,\nstations, and associated facilities. An additional 200 ha will be acquired for temporary use\nduring construction. Forty-three percent of the permanently acquired land and 12 percent of the\ntemporary land is agricultural land. About 460,000 square meters (m2) of buildings will be\nremoved for construction purposes. Most of the buildings to be demolished are farmers\u2019 houses\nand outbuildings. Loss of land or housing, or both, will affect about 19,340 people in 4,300\nhouseholds. The number of affected people constitutes less than one half of 1 percent of the\ntotal population of 4.1 million in the counties and districts on the route of the GLR. The proposed\nalignment was selected from various alternatives to minimize acquisition of farmland as well as\nminimize involuntary resettlement in rural and urban areas. The design includes viaducts and\nbridges, overpasses, and underpasses to reduce the requirement of land for right-of-way and\nminimize disrupting effects on the local community. The alignment and stations locations were\ndiscussed  with  local  officials,  representatives  of  villages  and  a  selection  of  farmers.  The\nselected alignment is both socially responsible and economically efficient.\n2. For the people affected by the Project, the Ministry of Railways (MOR), the Executing\nAgency, prepared a resettlement plan (RP) in accordance with the 1998 Land Administration\nLaw of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The RP was refined by the consultant under the\nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)2  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and incorporate the results of a socioeconomic sample survey carried\nout under the TA. The RP meets ADB's requirements for involuntary resettlement. As required\nby ADB, copies of the RP, in Chinese, were provided on 10 March 2001, to the counties and the\nrailway construction support offices (RCSOs)3 for information of the affected people. To ensure\nthat affected people are made aware of their rights regarding compensation, relocation, and\nprotection of their economic security, a resettlement information booklet was prepared by MOR\nand distributed by local governments to the villages and townships along the GLR on 23 March\n2001.\nB.  Socioeconomic Analysis\n3. As  part  of  project  preparation,  a  socioeconomic  analysis  was  carried  out  with  the\nparticipation  of  local  officials,  project  beneficiaries,  and  people  affected  by  the  Project.  A\nsocioeconomic sample household survey was carried out by the TA consultant in association\nwith the Fourth Survey and Design Institute during June-December 2000. During this period the\nviews and concerns of the affected people were sought several times. Except Ganxian County\nand Xinlou District at the ends of the GLR, the remaining six intermediate counties are poverty\ncounties. The incidence of rural poverty in the project area based on rural per capita income of\nY1,000 per year was 21 percent. No indigenous people lived along the alignment. Less than 1.5\npercent  of  the  people  were  nonindigenous  members  of  minority  nationalities  who  are\neconomically and socially integrated and not disadvantaged compared with their Han (majority)\n                  \n1 The eight counties/district are Ganxian, Huichang, Ruijin, and Yudu counties in Ganzhou City (prefecture level);\nand Changting, Liancheng, and Shanghang counties and Xinlou District in Longyan City (prefecture level).\n2 TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project, for $750,000, approved on 30 August 2000.\n3 The involved prefectures and counties have set up RCSOs to facilitate acquiring land, relocating buildings, and\nother resettlement activities.", "59\nAppendix 14, page 2\nneighbors. The local people strongly support the Project. Ninety-six percent of households\nsurveyed favored the Project. Local people, especially in the six intermediate counties that do\nnot have railway transport service, see the GLR as the key to greater mobility, economic\ndevelopment, and prosperity.\nC.  Resettlement Plan\n4. The primary objective of the RP is to restore the income and living standards of the\naffected people within a short period after resettlement, with as little disruption as possible to\ntheir  economic  and  social  environment.  The  RP  has  set  out  criteria  for  identifying  project\naffected people, including those who might be affected by the acquisition of resettlement land,\nand access and link roads. Provision of compensation for land acquisition and resettlement is\nbased on the agreements between MOR and Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, which follow the\nPRC's Land Administration Law and provincial regulations. The RP includes an entitlement\nmatrix to compensate affected people based on the nature of losses and includes compensation\nfor loss of buildings, costs of relocation, acquiring replacement land, loss of crops and of\nincome-producing trees, costs of relocating graves and tombs, and subsistence allowance due\nto loss of income or wages during the transition. The RP provides for alternative employment,\nassistance for those desiring to begin or improve small business activities, and assistance\nduring relocation.\n5. Short- and long-term strategies envisaged in the RP will provide access to land and\nemployment  so  that  the  affected  people  can  regain  and  improve  their  livelihoods  in  the\npostresettlement period. The strategies will allow them to benefit from the Project by exploiting\nthe commercial and economic opportunities it induces. Should people experience particular\nhardship in restoring their livelihood, the monitoring teams and local government officials will\nprovide necessary assistance. In addition, several avenues for redressing grievances (through\nlocal land administration bureaus, local governments, MOR, and law courts) are available under\nthe PRC law. Where necessary, the affected people will be assisted by increased resettlement\nsubsidy as specified in the 1998 PRC Land Administration Law. The RP will ensure that project-\naffected people receive assistance so that they are at least as well off as they would have been\nin the absence of the Project.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n6. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement, including contingencies, is estimated at\nY313.7 million ($38 million equivalent). The amount is included in the project cost estimates and\nwill be financed by MOR, including any cost overrun to meet the objectives of the RP.\nE.  Organization and Implementation\n7. MOR  will  have  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RP.  The  institutional\nresponsibility for implementing land acquisition and resettlement will rest with the provinces,\nprefectures,  and  counties  traversed  by  the  GLR.  MOR  will  pay  compensation  to  the\ngovernments of the two provinces crossed by the GLR. The provinces will compensate the\nrelevant  local  governments,  which  deal  directly  with  the  affected  individuals  and  village\ncollectives.  The  RCSOs  are  in  charge  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  and  compensation,\ndisbursing  compensation  received,  and  implementing  resettlement.  The  county  land\nadministration bureaus are in charge of acquiring land, surveying, recording the area involved,\nand categorizing land into quality levels. Periodic resettlers\u2019 meetings will be held at the local\nlevel to discuss the RP, the implementation schedule, policies, and standards of compensation;", "60\nAppendix 14, page 3\nand  to  receive  feedback  from  the  affected  people.  Local  units  of  the  All  China  Women\u2019s\nFederation will participate in the process to ensure that the needs of women, particularly women\nwho head a household, are understood and met at all stages of the process.\n8. Building the 277 km GLR will be carried out under 19 contract sections. Construction of\ndifferent contract sections will be started in early 2002 after the award of civil works contracts.\nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  implementation  timetable  will  match  the  civil  works\nconstruction.  Land  acquisition  will  be  done  before  civil  works  construction  is  started,  and\nsufficient time will be allowed for the removal and reconstruction of new housing. Detailed\nidentification and classification of land to be acquired will be started in April 2001, followed by\nquantifying of housing and attachments, public consultation and negotiation with the affected\npersons,  and  preparation  of  compensation  and  resettlement  details.  Disbursement  of\ncompensation  and  housing  restoration  will  follow.  Activities  related  to  removal  and\nreconstruction with anticipated completion times and primary institutional responsibilities are\ndetailed in the RP.\n9. Local officials are experienced in resettlement and compensation. Most counties and\nboth prefectures have just completed resettlement related to the upgrading and reconstruction\nof national highways 323 and 319, which parallel much of the GLR. In addition, officials in\nLongyan  Prefecture  have  experience  with  resettlement  for  the  ADB-funded  hydroelectric\nproject,4  as  well  as  for  the  Longyan-Meizhou  Railway.  Ganzhou  Prefecture  officials  have\nresettlement experience with the Jingjiu Railway.5 Local officials are familiar with the Land\nAdministration Law, and provincial regulations and are committed to realizing its principles.\nBecause of the detailed planning done and consultation with affected persons, no significant\nproblems are envisaged in acquiring land and resettling the affected persons.\nF.  Monitoring\n10. MOR will report the progress on land acquisition and resettlement to ADB through the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation. MOR will engage a suitable domestic\nconsultant  to  independently  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  RP,  conduct  annual  survey\nupdates6  during  resettlement  implementation,  report  on  completion  of  the  resettlement,  and\nevaluate the resettlement process two years after completion of resettlement. MOR will provide\nthese  reports  to  ADB.

General. The financial, economic, and distribution analyses for the Ganzhou-Longyan\nRailway (GLR) Project was conducted for 5 years of the construction period from 2002 to 2006\nand 20 years of operation from 2007 to 2026, in 2001 constant prices.1\n2. Financial Evaluation. The financial internal rate of return was calculated based on the\ncapital costs for the Project covered by the cost estimates and rolling stock, the revenue stream\nfrom the assumed traffic and tariff, the recurring costs, and the taxes paid (Tables A17.1 and\nA17.2). The capital costs include physical contingency and construction of additional stations\nscheduled  in  2011  and  2016,  but  excludes  the  financial  charges  during  construction  and\nchanges in working capital.\n3. To achieve full cost recovery nominal freight tariff is assumed at Y0.2143 per ton-\nkilometer  (km)  (providing  unit  freight  revenue  of  Y0.205  per  ton-km),  including  railway\nconstruction fund (RCF) surcharge of Y0.033 per ton-km (providing RCF surcharge revenue of\nY0.032 per ton-km). The passenger unit revenue is assumed at Y0.1133 per passenger-km\nreflecting a real increase of 5 percent per year up to 2006 and 1.5 percent thereafter.2 The\nweighted average cost of capital was calculated at 3.4 percent based on the after-tax real\ninterest rate of each debt,3 including 0.18 percent of the annualized front-end fee for the Asian\nDevelopment Bank loan and the opportunity cost for the RCF.\n4. Economic Evaluation. The economic internal rate of return was calculated based on a\ncomparison of with- and without-project scenarios (Tables A17.2 and A17.3). The economic\ncosts and benefits were presented in the domestic numeraire. The economic costs include the\nrailway construction and operating costs and those for the station access roads and the link\nroads.  Each  cost  component,  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable,  was  calculated  from\nfinancial prices by using the corresponding conversion factor and a shadow exchange rate\nfactor of 1.08 applicable for tradable goods. The opportunity cost was estimated at 0.75 and 1.0\nof the wages for unskilled and skilled labor. Land opportunity cost, which is represented as the\neconomic value of land, was computed annually taking into account the productivity increases of\ncultivated land by different types of land use.\n5. The transport economic benefits consist of (i) operating cost saving in diverted freight\nand passenger traffic from existing railway routes and roads; the difference of net economic\noperating cost per ton-km between the GLR and the roads was Y0.245 per ton-km and Y0.0752\nper passenger-km in the base case; (ii) operating cost saving in generated passengers in local\nand interline traffic calculated by the estimated passenger-km multiplied by one half of the\nsavings of the economic operating cost between the railway and the buses; (iii) time saving in\ndiverted passenger traffic from the existing railway and buses operating at 35 km per hour on\naverage, based on the value of time per passenger-km estimated from the average net income\nof rural people in each province; and (iv) the net economic value in the project area calculated\n                                                          \n1 As project physical completion is scheduled in mid-2006, followed by a half-year of trial operation. Revenue from\nthe half-year trial operation was excluded, but the half-year expenses were reflected as the cost for preparation of\ncommercial operation.\n2 Considering the socioeconomic situation and affordability by poor people the passenger tariff for a hard seat is\nassumed to remain constant. For 2006, the unit passenger revenue is estimated to be higher than the hard seat\ntariff by 93.4 percent, ranging from 86 percent for local traffic and 112 percent for transit traffic.\n3 The interest rate for the ADB loan is assumed at 6.9 percent, which is an interpolated 25-year fixed rate interest\nbased on the current swap market. The China Development Bank loan will carry an interest rate of 5.9 percent per\nannum. The opportunity cost of the RCF is taken at 8 percent assuming the 25-year swap-based fixed rate plus\nrisk premium to be offered to the PRC Government in the current market.", "65\nAppendix 17, page 2\nbased on the economic value per additional ton of each commodity of generated traffic as a\nresult of the construction of the GLR. The production of commodities was estimated from a\nstudy of the envisaged expansion and setting up of new industries in each county. Time saving\nin diverted freight traffic from the railway was negative as the GLR causes an additional length\nof haul to the national network for 2007 onward, although it is insignificant. Similarly, during\ninitial years of project operation time dissaving occurs in the diversion from the roads due to the\ndifference of average speed between trucks (50 km per hour) and the GLR (40 km per hour)4\nbased on the assumed same length of haul for both transportation means.\n6. Without the GLR, the national highways 323 and 3195 will be considerably burdened. As\nmost trucks are heavily loaded, the road degradation is fast and significant. The costs of road\nimprovements necessary to accommodate the assumed growth of traffic6 was included as\navoided maintenance costs for roads. Ganzhou and Longyan local governments will upgrade\n570 km of existing link and county roads to facilitate the access to the GLR stations.7 The\nbenefits derived from vehicle operating cost saving are 25 percent of the economic operating\ncost due to the improved road conditions multiplied by generated freight traffic discounted at the\nassigned  rate  for  Longyan\u2019s  link  roads.  Due  to  the  number  of  overloaded  trucks  and\nmountainous topography, the existing roads are prone to accidents. Avoided accident costs in\ntraffic diverted from roads were calculated only for fatal accidents, which were assumed to have\nan incidence of 1.2 fatal accidents per million vehicle-km.\n7. Economic  development  in  the  GLR  station  areas  was  quantified  through  the  net\neconomic value based on the estimated earnings per square meter along the station access\nroads.8 Approximately 30 percent was ascribed to the GLR. Incremental tourists are considered\nas another source of economic benefits for the project area. Each tourist is assumed to spend\nabout Y500 per day in the project area. The incremental tourism income was multiplied by 19.3\npercent representing operating surplus and taxes in the sector and further by 7 percent as a\nshare of the GLR. The environmental benefits from saving of emission of nitrogen oxides that\nwould have been caused by the transportation by truck were not included.\n8. Distribution Analysis. The distribution of project benefits was analyzed to determine\nthe extent to which the Project benefits poor people (Tables A17.4 and A17.5). The distribution\nanalysis brings out the differences between the financial and economic values arising from the\nProject, which have been reflected as distributional impacts to various beneficiaries. The net\nfinancial return to MOR, and the difference between net economic benefits and net financial\nbenefits was disaggregated for poor people in the project area, and the Project\u2019s poverty impact\nratio was evaluated.\n                                                          \n4 The calculated time dissaving for freight is multiplied by the economic value of each commodity and the opportunity\ncost ranging from 2.5 to 8.5 percent per annum.\n5 The national highways are located within a few kilometers of the GLR.\n6 Without the GLR, freight traffic to be carried on roads in the eight on-route counties/district is estimated at 12.2\nmillion tons for 2006, 16.3 million tons for 2011, and 21.8 million tons for 2016.\n7 Unit cost per km for upgrading the local roads is estimated at $0.25 million and 10 percent of the cost is assignable\nto the GLR. As the Ganzhou local government has already improved 70 percent of the link roads to all-weather\ntype, no benefits were counted for the link roads in Ganzhou.\n8 Local governments collect annual lease charges ranging between Y0.45 to Y0.75 per square meter.", "66\nAppendix 17, page 3\nTable A17.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return\n(Y million)\nCapital Operating and Freight Passenger Other

Introduction\n1. The  Government  has  prioritized  the  277  kilometer  (km)  Ganzhou-Longyan  Railway\n(GLR) Project as a poverty reduction project in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005). The GLR\ntraverses eight counties/district,1 situated in a mountainous area that is less developed and\npoor. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) will be the Executing Agency, and the Nanchang and\nShanghai railway administrations will construct the GLR and operate it in their jurisdiction. The\nGLR  will  facilitate  sustainable  economic  development  by  (i)  providing  the  necessary\ninfrastructure, (ii) improving access to wider markets, and (iii) encouraging labor mobility. Cash\ncrops, agricultural processing, tourism industry, as well as service-oriented activities in the\nregion will particularly benefit from the GLR. Incremental economic activities derived from the\nrailway will increase fiscal revenue to the local governments. This will expand local government\nresources to improve basic education, basic health, and other social programs for the poor,\nwhich account for more than 50 percent of their fiscal expenditures.\nB.  Poverty Reduction\n2. The achievements of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with reducing poverty have\nbeen exemplary with one of the best success records in the world over the last two decades.\nThe number of rural poor (with income less than Y635 per capita per year) decreased from 260\nmillion in 1978 to about 80 million in 1994. Since the beginning of the Government's Eight-\nSeven Poverty Reduction Program in 1994,2 poverty has been significantly reduced from 80\nmillion people in 1994 to an estimated 30 million poor in 2001.\n3. The PRC\u2019s general success in poverty reduction efforts can be explained by the wide\nvariety  of  programs  and  funding  channels  involved  in  the  effort.  Poverty  reduction  is\nmainstreamed among most central and local ministries, and an obligation for private sector\ninvestment and institutional partnerships. The national poverty reduction effort is coordinated by\nthe Leading Group for Poverty Reduction of the State Council. Government agencies are guided\nby three overarching objectives: (i) improving the subsistence standards of the poor (e.g.,\nincome,  land,  employment  opportunities,  and  other  income-generating  opportunities);  (ii)\nimproving rural infrastructure for the poor; and (iii) providing essential social services. A major\nreason  of  the  success  in  poverty  reduction  stems  from  this  equity  approach.  The  strong\ncommitment of the Government to poverty reduction, increased annual budgetary allocations to\npoverty programs, and institutional accountability are other factors critical to the PRC's success\nin reducing poverty.\n4. The Government is pursuing the poverty reduction objectives through the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan (2001-2005) and the Ten-Year Poverty Reduction Strategy approved in 2001.\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis\n5. General Approach. The detailed poverty impact analysis carried out for the Project was\nbuilt on the experience with previous projects with particular reference to the policies and\n                  \n1  The eight counties/district are Ganxian, Yudu, Huichang, and Ruijin counties in Ganzhou City (prefecture level; and\nChangting, Liancheng, and Shanghang counties and Xinlou District in Longyan City (prefecture level).\n2 This program recognized 592 national-level poverty counties nationwide to which the poverty reduction efforts and\nfunds were directed.", "71 Appendix 18, page 2\nprograms that facilitate employment and income generation for the poor. The analysis was\nbased on the exclusive work done under the project preparatory technical assistance (TA), 3\nincluding the results of a sample household survey, and discussions by ADB missions with local\ngovernments. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were made of the impact of the Project\non the poor. Links were established between the project intervention and associated programs\nfor poverty reduction. The qualitative assessment is supported by the quantitative analysis,\nwhich follows the relevant guidelines for social, financial, and economic analyses, with particular\nattention to distributional effects of the project benefits. The financial and economic analyses\nhave been brought together through the distribution analysis, and the net economic benefits of\ndifferent stakeholders were assessed. Poverty outcomes have been considered in the project\ndesign and specific measures have been incorporated to ensure that the envisaged benefits will\nbe passed on to the poor.\n6. Poverty Situation. The area traversed by the GLR in western Fujian and southern\nJiangxi has poor accessibility and is less developed; the people are poor. Except for Ganxian\nCounty and Xinlou District at the ends of the GLR, the remaining six intermediate counties are\nnational-level poverty counties with the exception of Ruijin, which is a provincial-level poverty\ncounty. Official statistics of the eight involved counties/district give the incidence of rural poverty\nbased on per capita rural income of Y1,000 per year at 21 percent compared with 12 percent\nnationwide. Since the Project is beneficiary nonspecific, therefore in accordance with the criteria\nset out in ADB's loan classification system the Project has poverty classification of other.4 The\nProject supports the thematic priority of economic growth.\n7. Results  of  Sample  Household  Survey.  The  sample  household  survey  (of  1,000\nhouseholds) done under the TA, showed a high incidence of rural poverty along the GLR. The\nsurvey  shows  that  having  a  wage-earning  member  in  the  household  is  important  to  raise\nhousehold  income.  The  importance  of  providing  employment  for  the  underemployed  and\nunemployed to raise the poor from poverty is underscored.\nTable A18.1: Income of Households With/Without Wage Earner\nPercent of Percent of Households\nHouseholds with Wage Earner\nNet Rural Income\nPer Capita Per Year Ganzhou Longyan All Ganzhou Longyan All\nLess than Y635 18.5 11.6 15.6 25.0 9.1 20.4\nY636-Y1120 46.2 28.0 38.6 29.3 19.8 26.4\nY1,121-Y1,600 28.4 16.9 23.6 24.1 22.9 23.7\nY1,601-Y2,500 5.0 21.2 11.7 48.3 30.7 26.8\n      Source: Socioeconomic household survey.\n8. Details of household income by source of income are provided in Table A18.2. Poor\nhouseholds rely more on agriculture as an income source than do households with higher\nincomes. Nearly 65 percent of the income of rural households with a net income of less than\nY635 per capita per year was from agriculture (crops and livestock), compared with only 43\npercent for households with incomes of Y1,601-Y2,500.\n                  \n3 TA 3486-PRC: Ganzhou-Longyan Railway Project, for $750,000, approved on 30 August 2000. The TA consultants\nand ADB missions held consultations with prefecture and county governments, including officials from the poverty\nreduction offices, representatives and village leaders, and a selection of farmers. Home visits were made to poor\nfamilies and households headed by women to assess the actual poverty situation, the reasons for poverty, and their\nopinions about the Project. The sample household survey under the TA covered 1,000 households.\n4 Asian Development Bank. 2000.

Poverty Reduction Effects of the GLR\n12. The project area is rich in natural resources. The Project will provide economic railway\npassenger and freight services to some counties and townships for the first time, thereby\ncreating the opportunities for the economic and social development to significantly reduce\npoverty. The Project will facilitate the development of natural resources and industries, thereby\ncreating  employment.  Substantial  opportunities  for  employment  will  be  passed  on  to  the\nunskilled workers in the area, and support the efforts of local governments to provide an\nenvironment in which new opportunities are created for the poor to raise themselves above the\npoverty line.\n13. The Project will reduce poverty by (i) providing employment opportunities during the\nconstruction and operation of the GLR, (ii) providing employment opportunities in poor villages\nfrom which suitable local materials will be supplied and transported, (iii) supporting the chain of\nsocial and economic improvements brought by the poverty reduction strategy, and (iv) fostering\ntourism  by  facilitating  cheap  and  convenient  travel  from  other  parts  of  the  PRC.  The\nemployment created by the GLR will be (i) direct\u2014to support the tasks and functions related to\nGLR construction and operation, and (ii) indirect\u2014created by suppliers of goods and services to\nthe railway, and employment created throughout the economy by the multiplier effects of direct\nbenefits. The estimates of employment are based on the study under the TA as well as a\ncomprehensive input-output analysis of the PRC economy.\n14. Employment During Construction. For civil works construction, the contractors will\nhire at least 50 percent of their unskilled workers from the list of poor households maintained by\nthe villages and poverty reduction offices.5 The benefit will be distributed to poor households in\nremote  villages  because  contractors  will  be  required  to  engage  30  percent  of  the  total\nrequirement of unskilled workers from remote villages. Construction of the GLR will create a\ntotal  of  76,000  person-years  of  unskilled  employment,  38,000  of  which  will  go  to  poor\nhouseholds. An additional benefit of this type of employment is the on-the-job training that\ncomes with it. Each worker will be able to seek other construction work with experience and\nskills learned on the GLR. The county poverty reduction offices will tailor some of their programs\nto ensure follow-up of households that gain additional income to ensure sustained gains from\nemployment.\n15. Construction of the GLR requires a large investment in materials and supplies. Materials\nthat meet the requirements of quality and economy will be procured from the poverty villages.6\nFor materials that are locally produced, at least 30 percent of the labor component is assumed\nto benefit poor households.7 The Project is estimated to create a total of about 20,200 new\nindirect person-years of employment to produce the required materials; 6,150 of these will go to\nworkers from poor households. Materials supplied from other parts of the PRC will create\n10,070 person-years of employment; of which 1,200 person-years will go to poor households\n                  \n5  During the field visit the Mission confirmed that the villages in both Longyan and Ganzhou prefectures maintain lists\nof poor households, which are used to prioritize employment to the poorest. MOR and the Nanchang and Shanghai\nrailway administrations, the implementing agencies, assured that at least 50 percent of the total requirement of\nunskilled labor will be engaged from the lists of poor households in consultation with the railway construction support\noffices.\n6 Based on the distribution of natural resources along the GLR alignment, about 30 exploitation sites for the supply of\nsand and stone will be established to meet the needs of the GLR. The value of the labor is paid to the worker and the\nvillage retains the value of the materials.\n7 This assumption is based on the assurance by the local governments and the experience gained on previous\ninfrastructure projects in this region.", "74\nAppendix 18, page 5\nbased on the poverty incidence of 12 percent for the PRC as a whole. Local governments will\nbuild station access and link roads that connect remote and poor areas to the railway to capture\nthe benefits from the GLR. The construction of the roads will require about 3,300 person-years\nof unskilled labor. Assuming that poor households would do 50 percent of the work,8 about\n1,660 person-years of new employment will be generated.\n16. In summary, during the five-year construction period, the Project will utilize a total of\n76,000  person-years  of  direct  unskilled  employment  and  33,600  person-years  of  indirect\nemployment. Of these a total of 47,500 person-years of employment will be provided to those\nfrom poor households.\n17. Employment during Operation. Staff for operation of the GLR (about 2,500) will be\nprovided by MOR by transferring surplus staff from elsewhere in the network under its staff\nreduction program. Spending by the railway employees and their families will have multiplier\neffects in the local economies. The GLR will hire contract workers to load and unload freight\nwagons  and  to  work  as  security  guards  for  the  stations  and  warehouses.  Of  the  total\nrequirement  for  unskilled  workers  in  these  categories,  70  percent  will  be  hired  from  poor\nhouseholds. Based on the estimates of diverted and generated traffic for the GLR, the number\nof contract workers required was estimated at 2,866 in 2007 and 8,510 in 2026. This would total\nabout 103,400 person-years of employment during the 20-year period from 2007 to 2026, of\nwhich 70 percent or 72,350 person-years will be passed on to poor households.\n18. Among the categories of freight traffic carried by the GLR is generated traffic, which\nconsists of goods that would not have been produced without the GLR. The new and expanded\nindustries will create additional employment. After the completion of construction, employment is\nexpected to be about 20,100 person-years in 2007 increasing to about 60,000 person-years in\n2026. This would total about 734,000 person-years of employment during the 20-year period\nfrom 2007 to 2026, of which 293,600 person-years would be passed on to poor households (i.e.,\nin the same proportion as the poverty incidence in the vicinity of  the GLR\u201438.6 percent).\n19. Local governments are promoting tourism to scenic and historical sites along the GLR.\nBecause tourism is labor-intensive, tourism-linked employment will particularly benefit the poor.\nThe study under the TA estimated that 43,500 new tourism jobs will be created in the eight\ncounties/district along the GLR. Using the railway's modal share of 7 percent of the total number\nof passengers in the PRC, about 3,050 new tourism jobs in 2007 are attributable to the GLR.\n20. The employment impact of the GLR is summarized in Table A18.6\n                  \n8  During the Mission\u2019s field visit, local governments confirmed arrangements for employing 50 percent of the total\nrequirement of unskilled labor for roads construction from poor households.", "75\nAppendix 18, page 6\nTable A18.6: Employment Impact of the GLR\n(person-years)\nEmployment Employment Passed on to\nCreated (Unskilled) Poor households\nConstruction Operation Construction Operation\nType of Employment 2002 to 2006 2007 to 2026 2002 to 2006 2007 to 2026\nDirect\nGLR construction 76,020 \u2014 38,010 \u2014\nGLR operation (existing MOR staff) \u2014 49,380 \u2014 \u2014\nLoading/unloading of goods \u2014 103,360 \u2014 72,350\nSecurity guards \u2014 1,280 \u2014 900\nIndirect\nGLR induced jobs(generated traffic) \u2014 734,020 \u2014 293,610\nMaterials sourced locally 20,230 \u2014 6,150 \u2014\nAccess and link roads 3,320 \u2014 1,660 \u2014\nRest of PRC 10,070 \u2014 1,200 \u2014\nTotal 109,640 888,040 47,020 366,860\n\u2014=not applicable, GLR=Ganzhou-Longyan Railway, MOR=Ministry of Railways, PRC=People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: Final report under TA 3486.\n21. The GLR will support the Government's programs for poverty reduction, such as (i)\nmicrourbanization  will  reduce  the  rural  population  from  73  percent  to  50  percent,  thereby\nincreasing the share of cultivated land per capita in rural areas and thus increasing income and\nreducing  poverty;9  (ii)  agricultural  programs  designed  to  increase  production  and  farmers'\nincomes have been prepared;10 the disadvantages caused by lack of land are being overcome\nthrough technological inputs and growing higher value commodities and two or three crops in a\nyear; in addition food packaging, canning, and processing are being developed to add value to\nthe commodity; and (iii) women\u2019s programs will support specific needs and development of\nwomen; the All China Women's Federation is active in representing the interests of women to\nlocal governments and in carrying out a variety of programs such as the Spring Bud program\nthat provides support to needy households to keep girls in school when their parents cannot\nafford it; and operates a small business fund for women. The mobility provided by the GLR will\nincrease the effectiveness of these programs.\nE.  Distributional Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio\n22. The distribution of project benefits was analyzed to determine the extent to which the\nProject benefits poor people. The distribution analysis highlights the differences between the\nfinancial  and  economic  values  arising  from  the  Project,  which  have  been  reflected  as\n                  \n9 Along the GLR, various towns have been identified for infrastructure and economic development. The county local\ngovernments are preparing proposals for townships, including station towns for improving transport linkage, roads,\nmarket facilities, warehouses, and factories. As for example, Jiangkou on the GLR will be upgraded into a county-\nlevel town as one of the 100 pilot national microurbanization towns in the PRC.\n10 Local  government  programs  for  poverty  reduction  include  technological  improvements  in  farming,  husbandry,\nforestry, village infrastructure, transportation, basic health, basic education, irrigation, drinking water supply, village\nroads, extensions and microfinance. These are funded by government grants and low interest loans from the\nAgricultural Bank of China. International and bilateral sources (i.e., the World Bank, International Agriculture\nDevelopment Fund, United Nations Development Program, and Germany) are also providing assistance in these\nareas.", "Appendix 18, page 7\n76\ndistributional  impacts  to  various  beneficiaries.11  The  net  financial  return  to  MOR  and  the\ndifference between net economic benefits and net financial benefits was disaggregated for poor\npeople. The Project's poverty impact ratio was estimated to be 26 percent, which is considered\nsatisfactory for an infrastructure project.12\nF.  Monitoring and Reporting\n23. The  Nanchang  and  Shanghai  railway  administrations  through  their  project\nimplementation agencies and the contractors will maintain records of total workers hired, local\nworkers  hired,  workers  hired  from  poor  households,  and  average  monthly  wage  paid.\nEmployment provided to workers hired from remote villages will be recorded separately. Poverty\nvillages that supply local materials for GLR construction will compile similar reports on workers\nemployed from poor households, and the revenue earned by villages by supplying materials.\nThis information will be provided to the project implementing agencies. Improvement of social\nconditions in the village made possible with the revenue earned from GLR construction will be\nindicated  separately.  The  county  governments  will  report  on  the  number  of  poor  persons\nemployed and wages paid during the construction of station access and link roads. During\noperation, Nanchang and Shanghai railway administrations will monitor the hiring of unskilled\nworkers  to  load  and  unload  freight  wagons  and  as  security  guards  for  the  stations  and\nwarehouses. The railway administrations will provide regular monitoring reports to MOR. MOR\nwill report this information to ADB in the quarterly progress report on project implementation.\n24. The Project\u2019s poverty reduction impact will be monitored with the assistance of the\nResearch  Institute  of  the  Southwest  Jiatong  University  (RI-SJU).  RI-SJU  will  monitor  the\nbenefits of the Project, including (i) number of businesses set up by poor households; (ii)\nvillage/township  improvements  made  possible  as  a  result  of  GLR  construction;  and  (iii)\nsocioeconomic and other impacts of the Project that will benefit poor people. This information\ntogether with a socioeconomic sample survey in the project area to be undertaken two years\nafter start of operation will be used to evaluate the poverty reduction impact of the GLR. RI-SJU\nwill prepare annual monitoring reports and an evaluation report two years after the start of\noperation, to cover all relevant parameters. MOR will provide these reports to ADB.\n                  \n11  ADB.  2000.
