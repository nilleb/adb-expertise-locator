INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is planning a study entitled the Economics of \nClimate Change and Low Carbon Growth Strategies in Northeast Asia, covering the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC), Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia. The Government of the \nRepublic of Korea will cofinance the study. The project seeks to address climate change issues \nin these countries and suggest growth strategies aimed at achieving \"green growth\" and low \ncarbon societies. The proposed study will capitalize on a similar study for Southeast Asian \ncountries.1 The  objectives,  scope, implementation  arrangements,  and  financing plan  of  the \ntechnical assistance (TA) are reflected in this paper. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Asia  and  the  Pacific  are  experiencing  considerable  environmental  stress  as  a \nconsequence  of  rapid  economic  growth.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change \n(IPCC)  estimated  that  developing  Asia\u2019s  share  of  energy-related  carbon  dioxide  emissions \nincreased from less than 9% in 1973 to 29% in 2005, and projected it will rise to 42% in 2030.3 \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 addresses climate change as part of the broader strategic agenda of \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).4 One  of  the \nenvisaged interventions is assistance to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects, while minimizing damage to the environment.  \n \n3.  The effects of climate change are already apparent in Northeast Asia as demonstrated \nby rising temperatures. In Mongolia, a steady increase in temperatures has been observed over \nthe past 60 years, with average temperatures rising by 1.8\u00b0C. As a result, the permafrost is \ndegrading intensively and the melting of high mountain glaciers has increased. The PRC has \nexperienced continuous warming during the past 50 years. Temperatures in Japan have risen \nabout 1.0\u00b0C in the past century, with a 2.0\u00b0C\u20133.0\u00b0C rise in large cities. This increase is likely to \nexacerbate the phenomena of \u201cheat islands\u201d in countries such as Japan.5   \n \n4.  The projected rise in sea level is likely to flood low-lying areas, affecting millions of \npeople in Northeast Asia (footnote 3). The sea level is projected to be about 40 centimeters \nhigher than it is today by the end of the 21st century.6 The maximum inundation area, for a 1-\nmeter sea-level rise with high tide and storm surge, is estimated to be 2,643 square kilometers \n(km2)\u2014or about 1.2% of the total area of the Korean Peninsula.7 In the PRC, a 30-centimeter\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

The increase in carbon dioxide emissions in Northeast Asia is likely to harm agriculture \nand other sectors. A doubling of carbon dioxide levels could decrease rice yields in many \nprefectures in central and southern Japan, even in irrigated lowlands, by up to 40%.10  \n \n6.  The forest coverage area of broad-leaved Korean pines is projected to decrease by \n20%\u201335% with a significant shift north.11 In Japan, about 90% of the suitable habitat for a \ndominant  forest  species,  beech  tree  (Fagus  crenata),  could  disappear  by  the  end  of  this \ncentury.12 A northward shift of agricultural zones in eastern Mongolia is likely a result of climate \nchange, i.e., the dry steppe zone is pushing the forest steppe north. This will shrink the high \nmountainous and forest steppe zones, while the steppe and desert steppe expand. Higher \ntemperatures are likely to increase the frequency and aerial extent of the forest and steppe fires, \nwhich would reduce forest cover. In Mongolia, a significant decline in the forest cover could \naccelerate desertification, contributing to an increase in the frequency and intensity of dust \nstorms and sandstorms.13 Countries such as Mongolia also face intensification of degradation \nand desertification because of shortages of water and precipitation.14 \n \n7.  Northeast  Asia\u2019s  vulnerability  to  climate  change  will  be  exacerbated  if  high  carbon \neconomic development continues. Climatic vulnerability is already imposing an additional cost \nas existing patterns of preparedness (e.g., physical infrastructure, organizational arrangements, \nwork habits), especially in the PRC and Mongolia, are no longer matching the unfolding climatic \ncircumstances. The overall picture therefore is that Northeast Asia is one of the regions that \nsignificantly and increasingly contributes to climate change, but is also being affected by it.15 \nThus, alternative ways of achieving development aspirations that lead to green growth and low \ncarbon societies in Northeast Asia need to be found.   \n \n                                                 \n8  B.

Climate Change Implementation Plan, East Asia Region 2009\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "  3\n8.  ADB is in a good position to undertake this initiative for the following reasons: (i) ADB is \nalready mainstreaming climate change in its core development operations under ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 (footnote 4); (ii) the study will be a major knowledge product that ADB can offer to its \nDMCs; (iii) the Action Plan for Implementing ADB's Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(2008) recommends that synergies be developed between disaster risk reduction and support \nfor climate change adaptation, because integrating the two is likely to benefit both; and (iv) ADB \nhas good working relationships and strong links with institutions involved in climate change \nissues, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \nUnited  Nations  Environment  Programme  and  its  subregional  partners,  and  the  Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF). In addition, because of the uncertainty regarding the extent of \nclimate change in Northeast Asia and its impact, this TA will contribute to identifying climate \nchange trends in Northeast Asia over the next decade and suggest policies for coping with and \ncountering future climate change impacts. The TA will also be able to corroborate other studies \non climate change and its impact in Northeast Asia. The proposed TA will coordinate with other \nongoing  and  planned  climate  change  initiatives  in  the  participating  countries,  allowing  for \ncountry-based mutual feedback and orientation of specific activities. It will also build upon \nexisting studies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to (i) contribute to the regional debate on the economic costs \nand benefits of unilateral and regional actions on climate change mitigation and adaptation; \n(ii) raise awareness about the urgency of climate change challenges; and (iii) indirectly support \ngovernment and private sector actions in the region for green growth and low carbon strategies. \nThe TA will cover four ADB members: Japan, Mongolia, the PRC, and the Republic of Korea.  \n \n10.  The proposed TA will build on ADB's successful The Economics of Climate Change in \nSoutheast Asia: A Regional Review (footnote 1), and complement ADB's parallel studies of \nSouth Asia and the Pacific. Japan and the Republic of Korea are expected to conduct their own \nassessments of the economic impacts of climate change; the study will mostly assimilate this \ninformation or place it in the regional context. In the PRC, the designated national authority\u2014the \nDepartment of Climate Change, National Development and Reform Commission\u2014is expected \nto prepare an assessment, and the ADB study can draw on the available information and \nanalysis.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA\u2019s impact will enhance resilience to climate change risks in Northeast Asia. The \noutcome of the TA will improve understanding of the economics of climate change to enable \npolicy makers in Northeast Asia to initiate mitigation and adaptation actions.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The proposed TA has four phases with corresponding outputs and activities, as follows: \n \n(i)  Phase I: Scoping and review. This phase will involve mapping and assessing \nthe current climate policy and adaptation measures at the country and regional \nlevels in terms of their impact on different sectors and segments of population; \nand options and costs to address climate change issues. It will also identify \n(a) policy  gaps,  and  vulnerable  areas  and  sectors;  (b)  socioeconomic  and \npoverty impacts; (c) implications of climate change for poverty reduction and \n ", "4   \nsustainable  development  efforts;  (d)  laws,  agreements,  or  regulations \nimplemented, adopted, proposed, or in preparation that address adaptation to \nclimate change; and (e) regional, national, or local initiatives on climate change \nissues. This phase will cover work carried out by governments, international \norganizations, academics, and nongovernment organizations. The result of the \nmapping and assessment activities will form part of the project interim report. \n \n(ii)  Phase II: Analysis of climate change. This phase will involve preparation of \ncountry-specific marginal abatement cost curves to analyze the GHG mitigation \npotential of technology options. An assessment of future climate change impacts \non  major  sectors,  including  agriculture,  forest,  water,  marine  and    coastal \nresources (including fisheries), and health, at the regional and country levels will \nbe conducted based on the outputs from the models under the IPCC climate \nscenarios. The analysis will be made by applying an integrated assessment \nmodel. Based on the regional and country impact assessment, climate mitigation \nand adaptation policies and measures will be formulated for the participating \ncountries and the region. These will be some of the highlights of the project \ninterim report.  \n \n(iii)  Phase III: Climate policy simulation. A climate policy simulation tool (CPST) \nwill be developed that will be used to generate key economic indicators to show \nthe economic consequences of different packages of climate policies. It will also \nbe used to conduct quantitative and qualitative assessments of different climate \npolicy  packages.  The  CPST,  a  consolidated  model,  is  comprised  of  three \ncomponents: (a) adaptation and impact assessment; (b) low carbon options; and \n(c) climate policy package. 16 The CPST will help policy makers select climate-\nrelated policies with concrete economic consequences of climate policy choices \nand to strengthen the policy analysis related to the economics of climate change.  \n \n(iv)  Phase IV: Dissemination. The final report will cover activities undertaken in the \nfirst three phases of the TA project. The TA results will be disseminated at the \nUNFCCC Conference of Parties 16, and the final TA results and findings will be \ncommunicated  through  participation  in  key  multilateral  events,  including  the \nConference of Parties 17. The results of the project will also be disseminated \nthrough publication of articles in external journals and books, postings on the \nADB website, coverage by international and national media, and presentations at \nconferences and workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.8 million, of which the equivalent of \n$1 million  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2018s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund \n(TASF\u2014others)  and  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea and administered by ADB.17 The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n16 The CPST will cost $600,000. Component (a) will receive $200,000 in funding from the proposed regional policy \nand advisory TA for Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia Part II: Adaptation and Impact \nAssessment.  Components (b) and (c) will be funded under this TA and will cost $400,000. The development of the \nCPST will be a joint initiative of both TA projects. \n17 Through the Korea International Cooperation Agency. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Within ADB, the East Asia Department will \nimplement  the  TA  in  close  coordination  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment.  The  TA  project  will  use  a  two-tiered  management  structure.  A  study  team, \ncomprising  national  climate  experts  from  the  participating  countries  and  international \nconsultants, will be formed to carry out the TA activities. A team leader will be appointed from \namong ADB staff. A steering committee, which will act as the project executive, will set the \nmethodological  and  strategic  directions  of  the  TA.  The  committee  will  comprise  senior \ngovernment officials from all the participating countries and representatives from ADB and \ninternational organizations, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific, to ensure full participation and ownership of the project by the participating \ncountries. Before commencing or financing activities under this technical assistance in the \nterritory of a member country, written no-objection will be obtained from the country concerned. \n \n15.  The TA will require 41 person-months of international consulting services and 80 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. A combination of individual consultants and a firm will be \nengaged to fulfill the requirements of the TA. A firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  with  a  simplified  technical  proposal.18 ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2008). The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  24  months  from  December  2009  to \nNovember 2011. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the Republic of Korea, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for Economics of \nClimate Change and Low Carbon Growth Strategies in Northeast Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n18 The CPST will have three contract packages.
