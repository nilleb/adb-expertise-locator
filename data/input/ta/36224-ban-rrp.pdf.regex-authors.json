The 23 \ndistricts are (i) in Rajshahi Division: Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagar, \nRangpur,  Nilphamari,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram,  and  Lalmonirhat;  (ii)  in \nDhaka  Division:  Mymensingh,  Kishoreganj,  Netrokona,  Jamalpur, \nSherpur, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Manikganj, Munshiganj, and \nNarayanganj; and (iii) in Chittagong Division: Comilla, Brahmanbaria, and \nChandpur. Poverty reduction will be realized by expanding the economic \nopportunities of the rural poor by improving rural infrastructure (roads and \ngrowth center markets [GCMs]), gender development, and improved local \ngovernance. Poverty reduction will be achieved by targeting poor areas, \nclosely  involving  the  poor  and  other  stakeholders  in  implementing \nsubprojects and maintaining rural infrastructure, and strengthening the \ncapability of local institutions. \n \nRationale  Efficient rural transport and supporting infrastructure are indispensable \nto  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  rapid  economic  development  in \nBangladesh. Investments in rural infrastructure have been made by the \nGovernment with substantial assistance from external funding agencies \nincluding the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Project draws on \nexperience and lessons identified from previous projects, particularly in \nmainstreaming  the  participatory  approach  and  empowering  local \ngovernment.  The  Project  area  consists  of  23  districts  in  Rajshahi, \nDhaka, and Chittagong divisions that were selected for their poverty, \npoorly developed road infrastructure, and need for strengthened local \ngovernance.  Improving  rural  roads  and  associated  infrastructure  will \nprovide local inhabitants with efficient transport to markets and trading \ncenters and access to social and welfare services. These improvements \nwill lay the foundation for better economic opportunities and assist in \nreducing poverty. Strengthening local government units will enable them \nto  plan,  manage,  and  maintain  the  local  infrastructure. Stakeholders \nfrom the private sector\u2014such as bus owners and operators, rickshaw \ndrivers, farmers, and local traders\u2014will be consulted on their transport \nneeds. Local participation will create a sense of ownership and focus \ngreater attention to effective maintenance. \n  \n ", "iv   \nImpact and  The  Project  will  upgrade  about  1,360  kilometers  (km)  of  subdistrict \nOutcome  roads, 780 km of union roads, 7,780 km of village roads, 370 rural \nmarkets,  and  190  union  council  complexes.  It  will  also  provide  for \nstrengthening  the  capability  of  local  government  units.  These \ncomplementary  elements  of  rural  infrastructure  will  provide  local \ncommunities with effective transport to markets and access to social \nservices. Investments in the Project will effectively reduce poverty by \nabout 7%, as small farmers and the functionally landless will gain from \nadditional employment, particularly of women. Additional employment \nwill  mean  increased  household  income.  The  improved  rural  road \nnetwork  will  bring  increased  motorized  and  other  transport  services, \nlower  transport  costs  for  goods  and  passengers,  allow  substantial \nsavings in vehicle operating costs, and catalyze an overall increase in \ntraffic volume by about 70%. The Project will improve the environment \nby planting and maintaining trees along the roads and building more \neffective drainage infrastructure.  \n \n \nProject  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $260.5  million, \nInvestment Plan  including taxes and duties of $20.1 million. \n \n  ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source  Total  Percent \nA.

The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. \n \nPeriod of   \nUtilization  Until 31 December 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project    \nCompletion Date  30 June 2011 \n   \nExecuting  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  in  the  Local \nAgency  Government  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment, and Cooperatives. \n   \n ", "v \nImplementation   The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  suitably  staffed  project \nArrangements  management  office  (PMO),  to  be  established  by  LGED  at  its \n  headquarters in Dhaka. A full-time project director will head the PMO \nand be responsible for overall project implementation and coordination, \nreporting to the chief engineer of LGED. The PMO will establish three \nregional  offices\u2014one  each  in  LGED\u2019s    district    offices    in    Dhaka,  \nRangpur,  and  Mymensingh\u2014each headed by a deputy project director. \nThe  deputy  project  directors  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation and supervision of project activities in their respective \nregions. The office of the deputy project director for Dhaka Division will \nbe based at the PMO. A project steering committee, established under \nthe first Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project and comprising the \nline agencies concerned, local government bodies, and nongovernment \nand private sector representatives, will provide overall policy guidance \nfor project implementation. \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines. All civil works will be procured from among qualified local \ncontractors through national competitive bidding procedures prescribed \nby  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulation  (2003)  and \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works for improving infrastructure will comprise \nmany small contracts scattered over a large area. The procurement of \nequipment,  including  vehicles,  will  be  by  international  competitive \nbidding for contracts above $500,000, limited international bidding for \ncontracts between $300,000 and $500,000, and national competitive \nbidding for contracts below $300,000. \n   \nConsulting  Consultants will assist LGED in project implementation. Three groups of \nServices  consulting  services  are  required  to  assist  in  (i)  project  design, \nsupervision, and monitoring, (ii) institutional strengthening and training of \nlocal  government  institutions,  and  (iii)  improving  LGED  capacity. \nConsultants under (i) and (ii) will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants under (iii) financed \nby GTZ will be recruited according to its own procedures.  \n \nProject  Benefits   The directly quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of savings in \nand Beneficiaries  vehicle operating costs on the improved subdistrict and union roads. The \nbeneficiaries  are  various  road  users:  bus  and  truck  owners  and \noperators, passengers, cargo movers, and the general population in the \narea of influence, estimated at about 6 million people, 50% of whom live \nbelow the poverty line. Improvements in growth center markets (GCMs) \nwill  enable  more  efficient  trading.  About  52,800  person-years  of \nemployment  will  be  generated  during  the  construction  period. \nPermanent  employment  of  women  (about  7,000  new  jobs)  will  be \ngenerated  by  retail  areas  in  GCMs,  the  maintenance  of  completed \nroads, and the maintenance of trees planted along subdistrict and union \nroads.  \n \n \n ", "vi   \n  The Project\u2019s overall economic rate of return is quite robust at 36% for \n  subdistrict roads, with individual subprojects\u2019 EIRR ranging from 12% to \nover 50%. The Project will reduce poverty by (i) enabling poor people to \nparticipate in economic activities and gain access to social services and \n(ii)  creating  additional  employment  opportunities  by  stimulating \neconomic  growth.  Beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  the  general \npopulation in the 23 districts, who will experience shorter travel time at \nreduced cost, as well as transport operators, traders, and consumers \nwho directly use the goods and services transported in and out of the \narea. \n   \nRisks and  The  Project  has  been  carefully  prepared  to  mitigate  risks.  To  avoid \nAssumptions  delays in start-up, advance action for recruiting consultants has been \n  taken. The preparation of the Government development project proposal \n  was  advanced  for  the  same  reason.  Risks  from  the  use  of  local \ncontractors will be mitigated through actions taken in earlier projects, \nsuch  as  training  them  on  construction  quality  control.  Participatory \nprocesses  involving  stakeholders  at  all  levels  will  foster  a  sense  of \nownership  and  minimize  delays  caused  by  lack  of  involvement  in \ndecision-making.  Environmental  and  social  processes,  including  a \nresettlement framework formulated for the Project, will address issues of \nlocal  sensitivity  and  minimize  adverse  effects.  Careful  attention  to \nmonitoring mechanisms during implementation will ensure that gender \nconsiderations  and  measures  to  prevent  child  labor  are  properly \nimplemented during construction.  \n ", "vii\n(cid:56)(cid:57)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.   I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be \nprovided by the Government of the United Kingdom through the Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) to the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) for the Second Rural \nInfrastructure Improvement Project (the Project).1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The economic development strategy of Bangladesh is closely linked to the improvement \nof  existing  rural  infrastructure.  Efforts  in  this  regard  were  initially  taken  in  1984  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s formulation of its National Strategy for Rural Development. The strategy focused \non channeling financial resources toward developing 1,400 \u201cgrowth centers\u201d where physical \ninfrastructure such as roads, markets, and storage facilities would be developed as a major \nelement of rural development. ADB and other development partners of the Government have \nsupported the strategy since its formulation and have made substantial investments in rural \ninfrastructure  development  through  the  years.  Appendix  2  presents  the  externally  funded \nprojects in rural infrastructure. Improving rural infrastructure has also been a key element in the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty. The national poverty reduction strategy2 (NPRS) aims \nto \u201creduce poverty within the shortest possible time so as to gradually lift the vast majority of the \npeople above the poverty line and improve their quality of life.\u201d More specifically, the country\u2019s \nMillennium Development Goal is to reduce poverty incidence in Bangladesh by half (to 25%) by \nthe year 2015. ADB\u2019s lending program to Bangladesh3 recognizes this linkage as it identifies the \nmajor causes of poverty in Bangladesh as \u201cliving in remote and unfavorable environments with \nlimited transport and other infrastructure.\u201d The Project addresses the problem  of isolation-\ninduced poverty by expanding the economic opportunities available to the rural poor through \nimproved rural infrastructure. \n \n3.  The road transport system of Bangladesh is an extensive network with a total length of \n272,208 kilometers (km). The primary road network connecting the major cities to the 64 districts \nof the country is 8,555 km long, while the secondary road network\u2014i.e., district roads (formerly \nknown as feeder road type A, or FRA) connecting the subdistricts4 to the national and regional \ngrid\u2014is  13,823  km  long.  The  Roads  and  Highways  Department,  under  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, administers the national and the regional grid together with district roads. The \nLocal Government Engineering Department (LGED) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural \nDevelopment,  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC)  is  responsible  for  tertiary  roads  (the  rural  road \nnetwork), namely the 36,166 km of subdistrict roads (formerly known as feeder road type B or \nFRB), 42,329 km of union5 roads (formerly called rural road, type 1 or RR1) and, together with the \nunion councils (UCs), the 171,335 km of village roads (formerly rural road types 2 and 3 or RR2 \nand RR3). Of the 36,116 km of subdistrict roads, about 50% are paved, leaving 18,277 km in \nneed of improvement. The need is even greater for union roads, of which only 20% (or 8,513 km) \nof the total are paved. The scope for investment in rural road development is quite substantial.  \n                                                 \n1 Project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n4  Subdistricts (upazila) are local government units at the third level of administration below divisions and districts. \n5  Unions are the next level of government below the subdistricts. A union typically covers about 30 square kilometers \nand has a population of about 27,000. \n  \n ", "2   \n4.  The volume of traffic in the country has been growing at about 7.3% a year, faster than the \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) of about 5.5%. Both freight and passenger traffic have \nshifted significantly from rail and water transport systems. From 1975 to 1997, the percentage of \nfreight  transported  over  roads  increased  from  35%  to  63%,  while  that  of  passenger  traffic \nincreased from 54% to 73%. Improved roads provide more comfortable travel, lower transport \ncosts, and significant savings in vehicle operating costs for all vehicles. With further upgrading of \nthe country\u2019s road network, the demand for road transport will continue to rise. \n \n5.  Funds for maintaining rural roads have been provided by the Government to LGED on a \nsustained basis since LGED assumed this responsibility in 1993. The Government\u2019s allocation \nfor this purpose has increased from Tk300 million in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to Tk4.0 billion in \nFY2006. Apart from these direct allocations, LGED also receive direct assistance from external \nfunding agencies, including ADB. For instance, in recently concluded FY2005, the total amount \nallocated by the Government for maintenance amounted to Tk4.8 billion, of which Tk1.1 billion \nwas contributed by external funding agencies. Taking account of funds from various sources, \nthe  allocation  for  maintenance  invariably  falls  below  the  annual  requirements.  The  gap \n(averaging about 10\u201315% in recent years) is likely to widen as more roads are improved. The \nRural  Roads  Master  Plan  (July  2005)  indicates  that  by  2015  no  new  improvements  on \nsubdistrict roads will be pursued and that, thereafter, as the need for maintenance rises rapidly, \nfunds for development will be shifted to maintenance. The estimated funding requirement for \nrural road maintenance from FY2016 to FY2020, when no new road improvement is envisaged, \nis Tk104.7 billion, or about Tk21 billion a year. An analysis of the rural infrastructure sector is \nsummarized in Appendix 1. \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  The  NPRS  has  provided  the  needed  direction  to  guide  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners in developing rural infrastructure through the years. Investments in the \nsector have been shown to result in higher farm productivity and income, particularly among the \nrural poor and women. The strategy has proven to be particularly effective in reducing poverty \nnationwide. The percentage of the population below the poverty line fell from 58.8% in 1991 to \n49.8% in 2000, or a decline of about 1% per year. A recent poverty monitoring report indicated a \nfurther decline of 5% over the 5-year period ending in 2004.  \n \n7.  The NPRS has been implemented through a series of rural infrastructure development \nprojects (RIDP-1, RIDP-2, and RIDP-3) and a rural infrastructure improvement project (RIIP-I) \nassisted by the ADB.6 The Project completion reports for the RIDPs showed that the projects \ncontributed significantly to the strategy, particularly by generating employment for the rural poor \nthrough  labor-intensive  constructions.  The  lessons  learned  from  previous  projects  favor  (i) \nemphasizing the pro-poor bias in the selection of areas to be covered under the Project; (ii) \nputting greater emphasis on stakeholders\u2019 participation in project design and implementation; \n(iii) strengthening local government capacity to manage and maintain rural infrastructure; (iv) \ncontinuing the hiring of local contracting societies for maintenance to provide employment for \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 1988.

LGED\u2019s  organizational structure  has  been  undergoing  changes  to  accommodate  its \nexpanding responsibilities for assisting the development of the country\u2019s rural infrastructure. \nRecent efforts to enhance its capability for planning, managing, and implementing projects were \ntaken  under  an  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  study  completed  in  1998.7  The  study \nconcluded that LGED\u2019s responsibilities have expanded more quickly than the capabilities of its \nstaff and that LGED should focus on consolidating and improving its internal efficiency. While a \nnumber of new staff have been recruited by LGED, including two additional chief engineers and \nsix  new  executive  engineers,  the  number  of  vacant  posts  remains  at  about  10%  of  total \napproved posts. Among the major recommendations of the technical assistance study are that \n(i) LGED develop a scientific organizational structure and install proper management systems at \nall levels and (ii) LGED upgrade its financial management system and fully implement the \nstandard system of accounts. Implementation of these recommendations is being carried out \nthrough a number foreign-assisted projects8 and will continue under the Project. In addition, \nLGED staff have been undergoing training in participatory approaches, project planning and \nmanagement, and social analysis.  \n \n9.  To reach a greater proportion of the population who would benefit from its development \nefforts, the Government has devolved to local government units responsibility for planning and \nexecuting various investment projects. In rural Bangladesh, the UC has been identified as the \nfocal point for infrastructure development, in addition to its major responsibilities for maintaining \npeace and order and implementing the Government\u2019s health and family-planning programs. \nUCs receive allocations from the Government\u2019s annual development programs and are also \nempowered to raise revenues locally to meet part of their financial needs. Assistance given in \nthe past has generally been meager; as a result, the UCs remain weak organizationally and \nfinancially. They also lack the technical capacity to plan and implement projects effectively. A \ncontinuing need is to strengthen the UCs and prepare them to assume greater responsibility for \ngovernance  and  to  make  them  effective  channels  for  delivering  services  from  the  central \nGovernment. Strengthening measures and project funds will be provided to the UCs under the \nProject to address this problem. \n \n10.  In its continuing efforts to pursue the NPRS, the Government added another 700 growth \ncenters in 1994 to the 1,400 identified earlier, in which rural investments are to be concentrated. \nThe growth centers were selected based on the size of population and area served and their \nrevenue potential, trading volume, and distance from neighboring growth centers. They are \ntherefore the locations for trade and commercial activities, so improving the facilities of growth \ncenter markets (GCMs) is seen as the key element of the country\u2019s rural development strategy. \nPursuit  of  the  strategy  has  proven  effective  in  rationally  distributing  public  investments. \nHowever, the need remains to introduce tighter regulations and encourage greater transparency \nin the management and operation of GCMs. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1998.

Improving rural infrastructure like roads, markets, jetties, and the physical facilities of the \nUCs can contribute to reducing poverty. Improved roads and markets lower vehicle operating \ncosts  and  marketing  costs  while  facilitating  access  to  such  public  services  as  healthcare, \neducation,  and  agricultural  extension.  A  study  carried  out  in  19949  showed  that,  in  the \ncatchment area of improved facilities, transport charges dropped by 19% for cargo and 23% for \npassengers, while the volume traded in the improved markets increased by 100%. Substantial \ngrowth  was  achieved  in  motorized  and  other  traffic,  which  increased  by  135%  and  85%, \nrespectively, after the roads were widened and paved. \n \n12.  In preparing the Project, stakeholder workshops were held at the union and the division \nlevels. The workshops confirmed the high expectations among local communities about the \nbenefits from improved rural infrastructure. The workshops also helped to identify issues that \nbear on the construction of specific works under the Project. The issues included the need for (i) \nmainstreaming the participatory approach and improving local government units, (ii) providing \nUCs with a sustainable source of revenue to finance their activities and services, (iii) improving \ntransparency and strict enforcement of existing procedures in the operation of rural markets, (iv) \nspecifying the roles of the local institutions in the sustained maintenance of completed facilities, \nand (v) improving the safety of rural roads. The lessons learned at these workshops have been \nincorporated in the design of the Project.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The Project impact will be to help reduce poverty by about 7% in the rural communities of \n23 districts in north and central Bangladesh. The impact will be realized through (i) enhanced \naccess for the rural communities to basic services, (ii) increased on-farm income from the greater \navailability of agriculture inputs such as fertilizer and high-yielding seed varieties, (iii) enhanced \nwomen empowerment through improved access to social services and higher family income, and \n(iv) improved local governance. The project area, totaling 47,152 square kilometers (km2), has a \npopulation of 55.9 million, accounting for 45% of the country\u2019s total population. The project area \nwas chosen because of its extensive poverty and low level of development. In the three divisions \nof Rajshahi, Dhaka, and Chittagong where the 23 districts are located, about 55% of rural \nresidents live below the poverty line, a percentage higher than the national average of nearly \n50%. Of the existing subdistrict roads, only 30% are in good condition, and of the 806 GCMs, \nabout 50% need to be improved. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  More than 6 million people will gain all-weather access to GCMs and social services at \nUC offices. The direct impact of providing these physical facilities and strengthening institutions \nwill be (i) an estimated reduction in poverty in the project area by about 7%, (ii) an increase in \nthe  average  farm  family  income  by  about  20%,  (iii)  an  additional  52,800  person-years  of \nunskilled employment during construction, and (iv) the employment of about 7,000 women in the \nnew GCMs, tree planting and care, and infrastructure maintenance.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n15.  The Project will include the following components:  \n                                                 \n9  KfW. 1994.

The Project will upgrade 1,360 km of subdistrict roads and 780 km of union roads to \nbitumen-surfaced  standard  and  to  provide  year-round  connectivity  between  agricultural \nproduction areas and GCMs. The Project will add about 7.6% to the current stock of improved \nsubdistrict roads (17,889 km) and 6.4% to the existing improved union roads (8,513 km). Each \nroad was selected through a participatory process with stakeholders. Structures such as bridges \nand culverts with a total length of 5,470 meters will be provided. Provisions for road safety such \nas road signs and loading and unloading zones will be incorporated into the design of subdistrict \nroads. Women belonging to labor contracting societies (LCSs)10 will be engaged to improve \nroad shoulders, plant trees on roadsides, and maintain roads. \n \n  b.  Village Roads \n \n17.  The Project will provide for resectioning 7,780 km of village roads with earthworks to link \nthe villages more closely with markets and other vital services. The roads will be selected through \nparticipatory  development.  Each  UC  will  be  asked  to  prepare  a  proposal  to  the  project \nmanagement office (PMO) to improve village roads in its jurisdiction. The PMO will review the \nproposals and, if warranted, grant them approval. Each road will connect the selected villages with \na higher-order road or GCM. Suitable structures such as bridges and culverts will be provided to \nclose any existing gap on the road. The UC will be responsible for maintaining village roads. \n \n     c.  Submersible Roads \n18.  A total of 60 km of submersible roads will be improved in areas that are rendered \ninaccessible  due  to  total  submergence  6  months  a  year,  i.e.,  in  the  haor11  areas.  While \ntransport needs in these areas are met by boats during the wet monsoon, boat services are \ngreatly reduced during the dry season, isolating large populated areas. The submersible roads \nwill facilitate dry season transport and communications and open up the haor areas to the \ndelivery of economic and social services. The submersible roads will have a rigid surface to \nbetter withstand prolonged submergence. The district office of LGED will be responsible for \nmaintaining submersible roads. \n  d.  Road Safety Improvements \n \n19.  The Project will improve the safety provisions for roads constructed under the Project, as \nwell as roads built under previous projects that do not have such features but require them now \ndue to higher traffic volume. Adequate road signs, markings, safety barriers, and loading and \nunloading zones near schools and markets will be built to make the roads safe. Safety manuals \nand posters will be printed, and awareness campaigns mounted, to further enhance road safety. \n2.  Improved Rural Infrastructure \n     a.  Growth Center Markets \n \n20.  A total of 370 markets will be improved under the Project, including (i) 52 GCMs located \nat subdistrict headquarters, (ii) 130 GCMs located in other subdistrict areas, and (iii) 188 major \nvillage markets. Each GCM will be connected either to an existing paved road or to one of those \n                                                 \n10 LCSs comprise poor women with limited income-earning capabilities who carry out routine maintenance on rural \nroads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by LGED. \n11 Haors are wetland basin depressions that get flooded during the monsoon season to as much as 6 meters above \nthe dry season water level. The haors perform an important ecological function, acting as natural water reservoirs.  \n \n ", "6   \nto be improved under the Project. Each GCM will be provided with paved trading areas, sheds, \na water supply system, adequate drainage facilities, sanitation facilities, and market offices. At \neach GCM, a market management committee will be responsible for ensuring proper physical \nand financial maintenance. Each village market will be provided with an access road, paved \nselling areas, sheds, and sanitary facilities.  \n \n21.  While the project GCMs designs call for each to include an average 12 shops for women \nvenders, the existing GCMs had been built exclusively for men. Accordingly, based on demand \nshown during participatory discussions, additional shops will be constructed to accommodate \nwomen traders. Each shop will measure about 6 square meters, have a roll-up door, and be \nconstructed in line with LGED\u2019s gender-sensitive design standard for these facilities. The added \nfacilities will provide more economic opportunities for women to contribute to the family income \nand to enhance their empowerment.  \n \nb.  Union Council Complexes  \n \n22.  To enhance the effective delivery of public services, the offices and facilities of union \ncouncil complexes (UCCs) in 190 locations will be improved. The improved facilities will serve \nas a one-stop center to provide the local population with ready access to social and technical \nservices for healthcare, education, agricultural and livestock extension, and land administration \nat the union level. Needed office furniture and equipment will also be provided to the UCCs. \nRoads to the UCCs will be improved to permit year-round access. The UC will be responsible \nfor maintaining UCCs using their own funds. \n \n    c.  Jetties  \n \n23.  To complement the connectivity afforded by rural roads and integrate land transport \nservices with water transport, 25 jetties will be improved in areas selected through participatory \nconsultation  based  on  agreed  selection  criteria  such  as  their  proximity  to  GCMs  and  the \navailability of land. Jetty improvement will involve installing mooring facilities at a cleared area of \nthe riverbank near the main loading and unloading zone, where boats can be securely tied. \nJetties will be linked to a paved road and located in the immediate vicinity of a GCM. Necessary \nsanitary facilities will be provided at each jetty site. A jetty management committee will be \nresponsible for its day-to-day operation and maintenance.  \n \nd.   Flood Refuge Shelters \n \n24.  To  provide  emergency  relief  for  victims  of  floods,  six  flood  refuge  shelters  will  be \nconstructed. Each shelter will provide accommodation for people and have a separate section \nfor  livestock.  A  typical  shelter  will  have  an  area  of  150  square  meters,  including  sanitary \nfacilities. Each shelter will be designed as a multipurpose building and located close to the UCC \nto maximize its use year-round. \n \n3.   Improved Local Governance and LGED Capacity \n \na.  Local Governance \n \n25.  To  enhance  the  capability  of  local  government  units  to  plan  and  implement  rural \ninfrastructure  works,  the  Project  will  implement  various  training  programs  and  awareness \ncampaigns for members and officers of 1,832 UCs, local women leaders, and members of the \nmanagement committees of GCMs and jetties. Training program topics will include the roles and \nresponsibilities of the UC, financial management, poor people\u2019s participation in local decision \nmaking, and participatory planning. The training programs will be supplemented by on-the-job \n ", "  7\ntraining and awareness campaigns using posters, comic books, and short radio and television \nprograms focusing on issues including governance (transparency, accountability, and efficient \nadministration), health, and sanitation. Selected young people, both male and female, will also \nreceive skills training on livelihood projects. Project consultants will assist in packaging the \ntraining programs and implementing the awareness campaigns. \n \n26.  Resource mobilization by the unions will be enhanced by full implementation of an \nexisting Government regulation assigning the collection of specific taxes to UCs, including \nassessments on homes and residential lots, taxes on professionals and owners of businesses, \nfees for birth and death certificates, and many others. To help UCs properly maintain various \nrecords and accounts, as well as manage its resource mobilization efforts, the Government will \nappoint, by 31 December 2008, an accountant at each union. In line with the newly established \nregulations governing the management of GCMs, members of UCs (including women) will be \nappointed as members of market management committees (MMCs). Guidelines on MMCs are \nbeing revised to regulate the award and management of new leases and provide for a higher \nshare of the income from market leases to UCs. \n \nb.  LGED Capacity Building \n \n27.  The Project will provide training to LGED staff both locally and overseas. Local training12 \nwill be given in contract management, financial management, participatory methods, construction \nsupervision and quality control, the application of information technology in project design, gender \nand development, and monitoring and evaluation. Overseas training will be given to LGED staff \nselected through transparent procedures acceptable to ADB. The areas of training will include \nsafe road design, rural road technology, field and laboratory tests for road engineers, and project \nmonitoring and evaluation. LGED will further strengthen its procurement unit by recruiting four \nadditional  engineers  and  five  additional  support  staff.  The  Project  will  include  an  internship \nprogram  whereby  senior  engineering  students  gain  practical  work  experience  in  LGED  to \ncomplement their formal education. In addition, the physical facilities of LGED in four regions will \nbe improved by constructing new offices-cum-housing compounds for the regional superintending \nengineers and staff. Dilapidated furniture in subdistrict engineers\u2019 offices will be replaced. Project \nconsultants  will  provide  on-the-job  training  to  LGED  staff  in  road  safety,  road  maintenance \nplanning, social assessments, gender development, and impact monitoring.  \n \n4.   Support for Project Management  \n \n28.  To ensure the efficient implementation and management of project activities, incremental \nstaff will be provided to districts and subdistricts together with needed logistics. A combination of \ninternational  and  national  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  to  support  project  design, \nsupervision, management, and capacity building. A series of socioeconomic studies that focus \non evaluating the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction and its strengthening of the capacity of \nUCs will be carried out to assist LGED in managing the Project. A benchmark study will be carried \nout at the start of the Project, followed by study on the third year and the final study at the end of \nproject implementation. LGED will undertake an evaluation study 5 years after project completion. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  The Project will strengthen local governance by providing additional staff to UCs and \ntraining to local officials, and by mounting wide-ranging awareness campaigns directed at the \n                                                 \n12  This part of capacity building will be implemented and financed in parallel by the German Development \nCooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). \n \n ", "8   \nrural  population.  The  capacity  of  UCs  to  plan  and  execute  local  projects  through  the \nparticipatory  approach  will  be  sharpened  as  officers  and  members  of  the  council  initiate \nproposals for improving and maintaining village roads in their jurisdiction. Based on proposals \ndeveloped by the UCs for village road improvement, they will be allocated project funds to \nmanage directly at the local level with appropriate guidelines and safeguards. The capacity of \nUCs for resource management will be further enhanced by employing an accountant at each \nunion. Tri-media campaigns explaining the roles and responsibilities of UC officials will be \nlaunched.  Diverse  issues  related  to  local  governance  such  as  transparency,  resource \nmobilization, cleanliness and hygiene, and law and order will be covered in TV and radio spots, \nand in posters and comic books to be distributed in villages.  \n \n30.  To ensure that project outputs and outcomes are achieved, the Project has created a \nresults-based monitoring and evaluation framework that will allow LGED to use data relating to \nproject results to support more effective project management. This results-based management \n(RBM) approach will increase the effectiveness of the Project by using data collected by project \nmonitoring and evaluation activities to allow the PMO and LGED to make management decisions in \na timely way and increase the likelihood of meeting output and outcome targets. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n31.  The estimated project investment cost is $260.5 million equivalent, inclusive of physical \nand price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. \nThe project investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \nE.  Financing Plan\n \n \n32.  The Government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $96.1 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance 36.9% of the project cost. ADB financing of \nthe Project will be done in a variety of financing options.13 The Project is expected to be \ncofinanced by the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom in \nthe amount of up to $60.9 million equivalent and by the Government of the Federal Republic of \nGermany  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) in the amounts $3.6 million equivalent (in kind), and $21.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  respectively,  subject  to  the  approval  of  their  higher  authorities.  The \nGovernment will provide the equivalent of $78.3 million (30.0% of the project cost), including \ntaxes and duties. A part of the DFID grant ($56.7 million equivalent) is on a joint basis to be \nadministered by ADB. The GTZ and KfW grants and a remaining portion of DFID grant are on a \nparallel basis. The Government has agreed to scale down the scope of the Project if cofinancing \ndoes not materialize. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \n33.  The ADB loan of SDR64.766 million will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. Interest during construction will be capitalized. \n \nF.

The  Executing  Agency  will  be  LGED  in  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  of \nMLGRDC. The existing steering committee under the ongoing RIIP-1 will oversee the Project.15 \n                                                 \n15 The secretary of LGD will chair the committee, with representatives from LGD; LGED; Roads and Highways \nDepartment; Planning Commission and Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation Division of the Ministry of \nPlanning; Economic Relations Division and Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance; National Institute of Local \nGovernment; Ministry of Women and Children Affairs; local government bodies; nongovernment organizations; and \nthe private sector. RIIP-1 was cofinanced by ADB and the German Development Cooperation through GTZ and \nKfW. Representatives from ADB, DFID, GTZ, and KfW will participate in meetings of the committee as observers.   \n \n ", "10   \nThe committee will meet once a year to review the progress of project implementation. The \nPMO,  headed  by  a  full-time  project  director with  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB,  will  be \nestablished by LGED in Dhaka. The project director will report to the chief engineer of LGED, \ncoordinate  all  project  activities,  and  be  directly  responsible  for  overall  implementation, \nmonitoring, and supervision. In addition to the project director, LGED will appoint three qualified \ndeputy project directors (DPDs), along with other qualified PMO administrative and support \nstaff. Two of the deputy project directors will be posted in LGED\u2019s divisional offices in Rangpur \nand Mymensingh, while the DPD for Dhaka Division will be based in the PMO. The organization \nchart for project implementation is in Appendix 4. \n \n35.  The PMO will (i) prepare an overall project implementation plan and detailed designs; (ii)  \nsupervise various civil works; (iii) organize and maintain the project financial accounts; (iv) \nimplement the gender action, resettlement, and environmental management plans; (v) organize \nmonitoring and evaluation; and (vi) prepare progress reports and a project completion report. \nThe PMO will be assisted by consultants with expertise in engineering design and supervision, \neconomics  and  finance,  social  and  gender  development,  participatory  approaches, \nenvironmental assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and local governance. The PMO will \nwork closely with the staff of LGED in district and subdistrict offices and coordinate with UCs \nand the management committees of the GCMs and the jetties in implementing relevant project \nactivities.  In  coordination  with  the  National  Institute  of  Local  Government,  the  PMO  will \nimplement capacity building for local government institutions (LGIs). \n  2.  Implementation of Subprojects \n \n36.  The  LGED  district  offices,  headed  by  executive  engineers,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing subprojects under the guidance of the PMO. In the course of its feasibility study, \nLGED has carried out the appraisal of 434 subproject roads, 167 GCMs, and a sample of 25 \nunion roads. Besides technical and economic viability, the subprojects included in the Project \nwere prioritized based  on such social indicators as poverty, gender  disparity, environmental \nconditions, requirements for land acquisition and resettlement, and, in the case of subdistrict and \nunion roads, connectivity to markets and higher-order roads. Prior to detailed design, the selection \nof the roads will be confirmed with the local community. As the socioeconomic conditions are \ngenerally homogeneous among subproject areas within a district, the social analyses will be \ncarried out district-wide. The results will be submitted to ADB and the cofinanciers concerned. All \nsubprojects will be implemented in accordance with ADB safeguard policies and requirements. \nDetails on the selection and prioritization of subprojects are set out in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n37.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from the second half of 2006 and to the first \nhalf of 2011. The activities during the first year include recruiting consultants, preparing detailed \ndesigns for the subprojects to be implemented in Year 1, and procuring office and construction \nequipment and vehicles. Civil works are expected to begin during the first quarter of 2007 to \npermit adequate time for preparing detailed field surveys and designs. The PMO will not award \nany construction contract until the land and rights of way are available, free of encumbrances, for \nexecuting them and necessary resettlement activities and appropriate compensation payments \nhave been completed. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n4.   Procurement \n \n38.   Goods, services, and civil works financed by ADB and KfW will be procured following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Since the civil works will be small and widely dispersed, foreign \n ", "  11\ncontractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding. Consequently, all civil work contracts will be \nprocured by national competitive bidding among qualified contractors in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contract  awards  for  all  works \nestimated to cost more than $300,000 equivalent will require prior approval of ADB and KfW, as \nappropriate. Bid evaluation reports will be submitted to ADB and KfW for approval only for \ncontracts above $300,000. Contracts for rural roads (excepting village roads), structures on \nsubdistrict and union roads, GCMs, UCCs, jetties, functional buildings, and flood refuge centers \nwill generally be awarded by the LGED executive engineer under the guidance of the PMO, \nwhile the contracts for structures on village roads will be awarded by the LGED subdistrict \nengineer  concerned,  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO  and  executive  engineer.  UCs  will \nimplement  resectioning  of  the  village  roads  with  LCSs  and  with  the  assistance  of  LGED \nsubdistrict engineers. Contract  documents  for  procuring  these  works  will  be  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s guidelines on LCSs acceptable to ADB. To ensure efficiency and economy in \ncontract administration, small contracts for roads and related improvement works at various \nconstruction sites can be grouped together to obtain higher value. The construction of roads and \nassociated structures such as bridges and culverts will be closely coordinated to maximize the \nutilization  of  the  completed  facilities.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  award  one  contract  for  the \nconstruction of each subdistrict road. Efforts will also be made to limit the number of contracts \nand engage larger contractors. This approach will shorten the construction period and ensure \naccountability  and  a  higher  quality  of  work.  LGED  will  award  contracts  for  infrastructure \nconstruction that prioritize the involvement of poor people, particularly women. Contractors will \nbe required to achieve parity in the payment of wages to men and women for work of equal \nvalue and regularly pay their construction workers, both women and men. Contractors who fail \nto perform satisfactorily  will not be allowed to participate in the bidding for subsequent contracts \nunder the Project. \n \n39.   Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured,  depending  on  the  contract  value,  by  (i) \ninternational competitive bidding when the estimated cost is more than $500,000 equivalent, (ii) \nlimited International bidding when the estimated cost is $300,000 to $500,000 equivalent, and (iii) \nnational competitive bidding when the estimated cost is $300,000 or less. The PMO will procure \nequipment and vehicles. LGED prepared a procurement plan for the initial 18 months, included as \nAppendix 6 and in greater detail in Supplementary Appendix X. The procurement plan includes (i) \nparticular contracts for the goods, works, and services required to carry out the Project during the \ninitial 18 months, (ii) proposed methods for procuring contracts that are permitted under the \nfinancing agreement, and (iii) related ADB review procedures. LGED has agreed to update the \nprocurement plan annually or as needed throughout project implementation. \n \n5.  Consulting Services  \n \n40.  Three packages of consulting services will be required to support project management \nand strengthen the capacity of LGED and LGIs: \n \n(i)  The first package will consist of design, supervision, and monitoring consultants \nservices, including 152 person-months of international and 1,504 person-months \nof national consultancy. Consultant services will be provided by an international \nfirm in association with a national firm(s) and will be selected by quality- and \ncost-based selection.   \n(ii)  The second package will provide institutional strengthening and training support \nto LGIs, consisting of 138 person-months of national consultancy. The consultant \nfirm  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  the  basis  of  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection and a full technical proposal. \n \n ", "12   \n(iii)  The third package will consist of 36 person-months of international and 552 \nperson-months of national consultancy to assist in building LGED capacity. GTZ \nwill provide these consulting services under the parallel cofinancing arrangement.  \n \nThe consultants mentioned in (i) and (ii) above will be selected and engaged by LGED in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference \nand a personnel schedule for the project consultants are in Appendix 9.   \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n41.  Land acquisition requirements for subdistrict roads under the Project will be minimal. \nLand required for the road and other infrastructure improvement is mainly within the existing \nright  of  way  or  owned  by  the  Government.  In  the  course  of  the  consultations  held  with \nstakeholders, landowners along the road alignments indicated their willingness to donate narrow \nstrips of their land to expedite road upgrading. To minimize delays due to land acquisition, the \nlocation of project infrastructure will be carefully selected. LGED, in cooperation with the UC \nconcerned, will complete the preparatory work for land acquisition in line with the provisions of \nthe country\u2019s Land Acquisition Law of 1982. Actual land acquisition under each subproject will \nbe completed by LGED within 1.5 years following the completion of the detailed design of the \nrespective civil work activity, or else the civil work activity will be excluded from the subproject. \nShould any subproject require resettlement, a district-level social analyses will be prepared and \nsubmitted to ADB, including (i) an initial environmental examination as required under ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy16 and (ii) a resettlement plan as required under ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement.17  LGED  will  disclose  resettlement  plans  to  affected  people.  Land  acquisition, \npayment of compensation, and resettlement activities will be completed before LGED awards \nany contract for the subproject. \n \n7.  Maintenance \n \n42.  The district office of LGED will be responsible for routine and periodic maintenance as \nwell as for repairs necessitated by recurring flood damage. Historically, funds allocated for \nmaintenance have fallen short of requirements, but the financing gap has narrowed. In FY2002, \na gap of about Tk1.4 billion, representing 43% of the requirement, was reported. By FY2005, \nthe gap had fallen to Tk436 million, or 8% of the requirement. By ensuring the high quality of \nconstruction and following design specifications strictly, the need for road maintenance will be \nminimized.  With  the  assistance  of  UCs,  LGED  subdistrict  engineers  will  engage  LCSs, \nconsisting mostly of poor women, to undertake routine off-pavement maintenance, planting \ntrees, and caring for them. On-pavement maintenance will be carried out by LGED district \nteams. LGED will field at least two additional mobile teams per district to meet expanded \nrequirements. In line with existing practice, periodic maintenance, carried out every 5 years on \naverage, will be executed by the contractors engaged by LGED. Consultants will prepare site-\nspecific maintenance manuals that describe the maintenance procedures to be followed by \nsubdistrict engineers, LCSs, and local contractors. Consultants will conduct on-the-job training \nto  ensure  that  subdistrict  engineers,  LCSs,  and  local  contractors  are  familiar  with  their \nresponsibilities. The Government undertakes to provide adequate funds to LGED to cover the \nannual maintenance requirements of the infrastructure completed under the Project. UCs will be \nresponsible for maintaining village roads. Using part of their budgetary allocations from the \ncentral Government, UCs will engage LCSs for restoring with earthworks the alignment of any \ndamaged village road.  \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002.

To ensure timely fund flow for effective project implementation, LGED will open an \nimprest account in the name of the Project for ADB, and another for DFID, at the Bangladesh \nBank after the loan becomes effective. Payments for eligible items will be made through this \naccount.  A  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  adopted  to  facilitate \nreimbursement and the liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling \nof the imprest account will not exceed estimated ADB-financed expenditures for 6 months, or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The SOE procedure will be used for reimbursing \nand liquidating eligible expenditures for single transactions below $100,000 equivalent. German \nfinancing through KfW will be implemented as parallel financing, covering the four districts of \nGaibanda, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, and Nilphamari. KfW grant funds will be disbursed in a similar \nway under the KfW\u2019s Disposition Fund Procedure. \n \n  9.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  The PMO will prepare quarterly progress reports on project implementation and submit \nthe reports to ADB and the project cofinanciers. The report will focus on RBM, including the \nphysical progress of works and the status of poverty reduction, gender empowerment, and local \ngovernance improvement activities, as well as addressing the progress in meeting the project \noutcome and outputs. Within 3 months of substantial physical completion of the Project, LGED \nwill submit to ADB and the project cofinanciers a project completion report that will cover the \ndetails  of  project  implementation,  cost,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and \nimprovements in local governance. \n \n45.  LGED  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to  facilitate  the  identification  of \nexpenditures and income related to the Project. Sufficient and qualified accounting staff will be \nassigned to the PMO. External auditors acceptable to the ADB and DFID will annually audit all \naccounts and statements of expenditures and revenues related to the Project. The Foreign \nAided Project Audit Directorate is considered acceptable for this purpose. The annual audit will \ninclude an audit of imprest accounts and SOE procedures. The annual audit report will include a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. Audited financial \nstatements and project accounts, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to \nADB and the project cofinanciers within 6 months of the close of the financial year.  \n \n  10.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  will  be  strictly  applied  under  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  LGED. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  related  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and DFID in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the LGED and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. Anticorruption and fiduciary risk measures will meet or \nexceed DFID\u2019s requirements. The Project will incorporate the following measures to foster \nanticorruption efforts:  \n \n \n ", "14   \n(i)  To strengthen internal control, 10 regional superintending engineer positions will \nbe established as permanent positions, to be funded under the revenue budget, \nwhose role is to in enhance construction quality control and supervise effective \nwork. \n(ii)  Construction supervision consultants will support LGED\u2019s regional offices\u2019 efforts \nto  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  in  project \noperations. \n(iii)  An external performance-audit team acceptable to the ADB will be engaged by the \nGovernment to monitor and report on physical performance under the Project.  \n \nAs one anticorruption measure, LGED will, in consultation with the National Institute of Local \nGovernment, implement the action plan for local governance and so empower UCs, update \nrules  and  regulations,  and  enhance  transparency  in  UC  operations.  The  PMO  will  make \navailable on the LGED\u2019s website the detailed information on the use of project funds. \n \n  11.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation      \n \n47.  A project performance management system (PPMS) will be established and operated \nunder the Project. The PPMS will be designed to support the data requirements of a fully \nintegrated RBM system. Using the RBM system will ensure that deviations between the project \nplan  and  achieved  results  (outputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts)  are  recognized  by  project \nmanagement in a timely manner, thereby allowing effective corrective actions and decisions. \nThe  PMO  will,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  conduct  benchmark  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys in each project district and submit to ADB and the project cofinanciers, \nfor  their  review  and  approval,  a  detailed  PPMS  implementation  plan.  Throughout  project \nimplementation, the PMO will submit annual monitoring reports to ADB and the cofinanciers.  \n \n12.  Project Reviews  \n \n48.  Regular reviews conducted by the Government, ADB, and the cofinanciers will cover \nphysical implementation, financial performance, the implementation of action plans, and the \nidentification of problems that may require early attention. The Government, ADB, DFID, GTZ, \nand KfW will jointly conduct a comprehensive midterm review (MTR) in the third year of project \nimplementation. The MTR will evaluate (i) project design, (ii) stakeholder participation, (iii) the \nquality of works, (iv) social and environmental impacts, (v) capacity building, (vi) compliance \nwith  loan  covenants,  (vii)  the  improvement  of  local  governance,  (viii)  the  effectiveness  of \nimplementation  arrangements  and  project  management  structures,  (ix)  the  attainment  of \noperation and maintenance budget for sustainable maintenance, and (x) future implementation \nplans for the remaining works. The results of the MTR will guide modifications to the scope and \ndesign of the Project and, if needed, the reallocation of funds among the loan categories.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n49.  The results of the economic analyses show that the Project is economically viable. The \ntwo major components (roads and markets), accounting for about 80% of project costs, were \nevaluated separately. The combined economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for all subdistrict \nroads is 28.4%, with a range of 12-50% for individual roads. The combined EIRR for all markets is \n51%. The summary economic analysis is in Appendix 10. In addition to the quantifiable benefits of \nthe two components, other nonquantified economic impacts of the Project are time savings for \nroad users, better access to markets and essential services, lower prices for farm inputs and \n ", "  15\nconsumable goods, better marketing opportunities, and increased employment opportunities in \nroad and market construction, maintenance, and roadside tree plantation programs.  \n \n50.  Road improvement will permit more reliable access to social and financial services and \nagricultural and livestock extension. Providing submersible roads will reduce travel time during \nthe  dry  season  in  low-lying  areas.  Constructing  jetties  will  facilitate  the  safe  loading  and \nunloading of goods and passengers. Constructing flood refuge shelters will save the lives and \nproperty of rural people living in areas prone to flash floods. Constructing UCCs will provide \none-stop centers for various services for rural people. The program to develop human resources \nproposed under various components of the Project will expand the knowledge and skills of \nproject personnel and enhance how efficiently they perform their day-to-day activities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impacts \n51.  The Project will help reduce poverty by about 7% in the rural communities it covers. The \nbeneficiaries will be road users\u2014bus and truck owners and operators, passengers, and cargo \nmovers\u2014as well as the general population in the area of influence, numbering about 6 million, 50% \nof whom live below the poverty line. Direct employment generated by the construction of project \nfacilities is estimated at 52,800 person-years. After project completion, 3,200 new jobs will be \ncreated for maintaining the roads, with 30% of the labor for road maintenance provided by women.  \nIn addition, 2,600 new jobs will be created for poor women who will plant trees along subdistrict \nroads and then care for them, along with another 1,200 new jobs for women in operating retail areas \nassigned  to  them  at  GCMs.  Indirect  project  benefits  likely  to  facilitate  poverty  reduction  are \nincreases in farm income, estimated at about 20%, largely from 15% higher crop yields resulting \nfrom a 45% improvement in the availability and use of fertilizer and other inputs. \n \n52.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  a  number  of  indirect, \nunquantifiable  ways:  (i)  the  availability  of  improved  transport  will  facilitate the migration  of \nunderemployed  farm  labor  to  alternative  employment  opportunities;  (ii)  the  cost-effective \ntransport of produce will help farm producers realize higher farm gate prices; (iii) improved \nroads  will  enable  easy  access  to  rural  areas  for  service  providers  including  healthcare, \neducation,  and  agricultural  extension  workers,  as  well  as  nongovernment  organization \npersonnel;  and  (iv)  the  additional  traffic  volume  will  give  rise  to  transport-related  small \nbusinesses such as service stations, repair shops, food stalls, and guesthouses. Thus, on the \nwhole, the Project will not only reduce poverty but also improve the people\u2019s prospects for a \nbetter life. Appendix 11 gives the summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n53.  Improvements in the rural transport and trading systems, along with the development of \nthe UCCs for delivering social services to rural people, will yield significant positive social \nimpacts, particularly for women and children. The participatory approach to development will be \ninstitutionalized in LGED as a standard procedure for packaging projects. This will maximize the \ninputs from all stakeholders in the Project and ensure consensus. The mobility of rural women \nwill increase, which will help them to participate in local governance and decision making and to \nraise their voices to demand their rights and access to resources. This will improve poor \nwomen\u2019s capacity to manage household income and increase awareness regarding health, \nhygiene, sanitation, and the importance of education for their children, thereby discouraging \nchild labor. Flood refuge shelters will reduce the loss of valuable household assets during \nserious  flash  floods.  This  will  especially  benefit  the  poor,  who  have  only  a  few  essential \npossessions. The submersible roads will overcome dry-season isolation of haor areas, which \nlimits social, cultural, and economic development. Safer loading and unloading facilities at the \njetties will reduce injuries and accidents where most of the victims are poor. \n \n ", "16   \nD.  Resettlement \n \n54.  Adverse socioeconomic impacts may result from land acquisition and the relocation of \nstructures from the proposed right of way. The acquisition of narrow strips of land required for \nwidening  and  straightening  existing  roads  will  have  minimum  impact  on  individuals.  Growth \ncenters will be developed on available government land, and UCCs on land already donated by \ncommunity  residents.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  (Appendix  12)  covering \ninvoluntary resettlement for road improvement and voluntary relocation for developing GCMs and \nUCCs following ADB resettlement policies. In line with the resettlement impact assessment of the \nthree core subprojects, one full resettlement plan and two short resettlement plans have been \nprepared.  To  the  extent  that  the  detailed  design  for  the  subprojects  confirm  the  need  for \nresettlement plans, the resettlement framework and plans will be followed when preparing and \nimplementing specific resettlement plans that may be required under the Project. Indigenous \npeoples are not found in the core subproject areas. Any impact on indigenous peoples in non-core \nsubproject areas will be mitigated through specific action embedded in the resettlement plan.  \n \nE.  Gender and Development Issues \n \n55.  Women in the project area are mostly engaged in household and farming activities. \nUnder the Project, the following activities will be pursued to empower rural women:  \n(i)  increasing women\u2019s participation to at least 30% of total membership in project \nplanning implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and maintenance;  \n(ii)  generating  employment  opportunities  for  women  by  involving  them  in \nconstruction, maintenance, and tree plantation activities through LCSs and by \nensuring that, during construction, female laborers are provided with temporary \nsheds, water, and sanitary facilities;  \n(iii)  facilitating  rural  female  beneficiaries\u2019  links  to  different  support  resources  to \nsustain their livelihood; \n(iv)  developing the entrepreneurship of women by reserving for them market sections \nin GCMs (female shop owners will be linked with microfinance institutions so that \nthey can run their business and contribute to the rural economy); and  \n(v)  promoting  female  members\u2019  participation  in  local  governance  and  the \nmanagement of UCs. \n56.  The capacity-building component of the Project will incorporate gender concerns by \ninvolving women and training them in (i) skills for income-generating activities, (ii) off-pavement \nmaintenance, tree planting, and tree care as members of LCSs, and (iii) shop management and \ntrade skills development. Under the Project, 15% of the space for trading will be reserved for \nwomen (Appendix 13). The female shop owners will form an association and will be represented \nin MMCs and citizen forums. Through a series of workshops, female UC members will learn \nhow to prepare budgets, keep accounts, conduct meetings, and participate in social activities. \nThis will develop their capacity and enhance efficiency. The Project will considerably facilitate \nchild development by (i) increasing family income and so reducing the incidence of child labor, \n(ii)  increasing  access  for  the  children  of  disadvantaged  families  and  for  youths  to  skills \ndevelopment; and (iii) ensuring greater health benefits through improving access for the poor to \nhealth services. Over the long-run, activities addressing women\u2019s empowerment will help to \nnarrow the gender gap in Bangladesh. \n \nF.  Environmental Impacts \n57.  As the interventions under this Project deal primarily with road improvement, no new \nroad construction is envisaged, so adverse environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. \n ", "  17\nThey  can  be  reduced  further  through  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  The  potential \nenvironmental impacts are either short term in the construction stage or long term in the post-\nintervention stage. Potential short-term adverse impacts include soil erosion, water pollution, \nblocked drainage, traffic disruption and accident hazards, and dust and noise pollution. These \ncan be minimized by (i) limiting earthworks to the dry season, (ii) carefully planning drainage \ndiversions,  (iii)  restoring  and  rehabilitating  borrow  pits,  (iv)  safely  transporting  and  storing \nconstruction materials, (v) spraying water to reduce dust hazards, and (vi) prohibiting the use of \nmachinery after sunset to reduce noise pollution. \n \n58.  In the long run, the Project will (i) benefit the environment by planting trees along \nroadsides, which will also prevent soil erosion from embankment slopes; (ii) improve regional \nhydrology  by  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  cross-drainage  structures,  (iii)  reduce  dust \npollution and improve water quality by bituminizing the pavement, (iv) facilitate and improve \naccess to markets for trade and income generation, (v) allow easy movement of motorized and \nother traffic, and (vi) generally improve the aesthetic quality of the region. In addition, market \nimprovement  measures  will  enhance  the  environmental  quality  of  GCMs.  Community \nmanagement and ownership of planted trees has been used in other projects, including rural \ninfrastructure-development projects, and the lessons learned in those projects suggest that the \napproach taken under the Project should be effective.   \n \n59.  The potential adverse impacts from project interventions may include disrupted fishing \nactivities, flooding from drain congestion, the loss of trees, and the loss of agricultural land and \nother assets from road widening. The only ecologically sensitive area in the project area is the \nMadhupur Forest. The Project includes no intervention in this zone that may adversely affect its \necology.  Likewise,  careful  planning  will  be  done  during  the  design  and  construction  of \nsubmersible  roads  in  the  haor  areas  in  Netrokona  and  Kishoreganj  districts.  All  potential \nnegative impacts will be minimized by adopting such mitigation measures as (i) tree planting on \nroadsides  to  stabilize  soil  and  compensate  for  tree  removal;  (ii)  providing  adequate,  and \nsufficient numbers of, cross-drainage structures to facilitate fish migration and flood passage; \nand (iii) careful road alignment during road widening to minimize farmland and asset loss. A \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the project area was undertaken with a focus on three core \nsubprojects that identifies both positive and negative impacts, suggests mitigation measures, \nand outlines monitoring needs. Recruiting additional expertise in environmental assessment and \nmonitoring will help enhance the capability of the environmental unit of LGED. \n \nG.  Impact on Local Governance \n \n60.  The Project will strengthen local government institutions such as UCs, not only through a \nseries of training programs for UC members and staff but also by providing them with project \nfunds. Under the Project, UCs will gain, through a participatory approach, hands-on experience in \npreparing small projects, in this case to improve village roads, and seeing to their implementation \nunder transparent procedures with technical guidance from LGED. The UCs that perform credibly \nin this regard will receive additional funds for a second project. This process will show UC \nmembers  that  good  performance  is  rewarded,  thus  preparing  them  to  take  on  greater \nresponsibilities in the future. An action plan for improving local governance is in Appendix 14. \n \nH.  Risks  \n61.  The risks faced by the Project are manageable and will be largely mitigated in the course \nof project implementation. Potential delays in project start-up will be reduced by taking advance \naction to recruit consultants. Some contractors\u2019 limited experience in implementing foreign-aided \n \n ", "18   \nprojects will be remedied by their participation in training programs under the Project. Using \nADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  standard  tender  procedures  will  minimize  delays.  The \nGovernment commitment of counterpart funding through budgetary allocations will be required \nbefore ADB approves contract awards. \n \n62.  While local government institutions have some organizational weaknesses, the central \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  strengthening  them  under  the  current  drive  toward \ndecentralization  will  mitigate  this  risk.  Furthermore,  the  provisions  under  the  Project  for \naugmenting the capabilities of the officers and members of UCs will reduce the risk. Training \nprograms under the Project will raise the level of awareness among stakeholders about local \ngovernance issues. \n \n63.  The fiscal sustainability of previous projects has been an issue in respect to financing road \nmaintenance. Although the funds made available have historically fallen short of requirements, the \ngap  has  narrowed  considerably.  The  gap  between  total  requirements  and  actual  allocation \ndropped from 43% in 2002 to less than 10% in 2005. The Government has agreed to close the \ngap by increasing budgetary allocations to LGED. The Government\u2019s commitment to development \npartners to introduce a mechanism for assured funding of road maintenance will reduce this risk \nsignificantly. Another dimension of fiscal sustainability that is specific to the Project pertains to the \nparticipation of UCs in implementing the village road component. This is a new activity that has \nbeen included in the Project following the central Government\u2019s grant of an annual allocation to \neach UC (amounting to Tk646,000 in 2005) to meet developmental and operational needs. Using \npart  of  the  annual  budget,  UCs  will  contribute  10%  of  the  cost  of  improving  village  roads, \nestimated at Tk18,300 per km. Implementing village road components will gradually empower \nUCs in project planning and design after UC members and staff have undertaken intensive \ntraining in these fields. Considering the low cost of labor-intensive maintenance of village roads, \nthe  funding  needs  can  be  met  from  the  UCs  annual  budgetary  allocation.  Under  these \narrangements, and given the regular budgetary allocations to UCs, the risks associated with \nimplementing the village road component are considered to be minimal. \n \n64.  During construction, the incidence of direct and indirect child labor in the Project may \nincrease, especially in construction support services such as stone- and brick-breaking, non-\nmotorized transportation, brick manufacturing, and other service industries that tend to employ \nchild labor. Encouraging income-generating schemes and micro-enterprises may also result in \nincreased child labor. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n65.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and LGED have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n(i)  The  Government  shall  approve  by  31  December  2009  the  revised  GCM \nmanagement committee guidelines that cover the increased responsibility of the \nUCs and their increased share from the market lease income to cover the cost of \noperation and maintenance of GCMs. \n(ii)  The Government shall undertake all necessary actions so that,  \n(a)  by  31  December  2007,  (i)  10  permanent  positions  of  superintending \nengineers funded from the revenue budget are established at LGED to \nenhance  construction  quality  control  and  supervision,  and  oversee \n ", "  19\nregional  training  programs,  (ii)  10  additional  permanent  positions  of \nexecutive engineers funded from the revenue budget are established at \nthe regional offices of LGED to conduct and implement necessary training \nprograms, both on-the-job training and through workshops, and (iii) 64 \nsocial scientists for the approved positions are appointed, one for each of \nthe district offices of LGED; and,  \n(b)  by 31 December 2008, (i) an accountant assistant is appointed for each \nUC  to  strengthen  its  financial  transparency;  (ii)  LGED  has  a  fully \noperational design and planning unit staffed with full-time personnel; and \n(iii) an additional four engineers and five supporting staff are recruited for \nthe procurement unit of the LGED. \n(iii)  Before 30 June of each year during project implementation, LGED and ADB shall \nagree on the annual maintenance program, including the required budget, for \nsubdistrict and union roads in the project area for the following year.

Introduction \n \n1.  Rural  development  is  critical  to  poverty  reduction  in  Bangladesh,  as  75%  of  the \npopulation and 85% of the poor live in rural areas. The rural economy accounts for about 60% \nof  GDP.  Over  the  past  decade,  the  development  of  rural  transport  and  communications \nnetworks and widespread access to primary education and basic health facilities have enabled \nrural Bangladesh to emerge from its isolation. A more mobile, healthier, and more literate rural \npopulation has taken advantage of a wide range of off-farm employment opportunities, including \nsome linked to the farm sector and others located in the urban and peri-urban areas of the main \ncities. Some 3 million Bangladeshis now work abroad, and their remittances have financed a \nvast array of new rural businesses. Developing the infrastructure and institutions to support \nbroad-based rural development is essential to generating employment and livelihoods for the \nrural poor.  \n \nB.  Sector issues and Development Challenges \n \n2.  Many rural communities lack road links, while others suffer from underinvestment in \noperation and maintenance. Local governments have had limited involvement in the design, \nimplementation,  and  management  of  rural  infrastructure.  Greater  local  participation  in  the \nprovision of local infrastructure is necessary to ensure that (i) what is constructed improves rural \nmarket  access;  (ii)  rural  infrastructure  development  creates  opportunities  for  the  poor, \nparticularly women, to access the core economic and local governance infrastructure; and \n(iii) what is built can be used effectively and sustained in the long run. \n \nC.  Government\u2019s Strategy \n   \n3.  The national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) emphasizes that rural development will \ngenerate employment and sustainable livelihood opportunities for the rural poor. The NPRS \nprioritizes (i) accelerated growth in rural areas, and development of agriculture and nonfarm \neconomic  activities;  (ii)  fostering  the  growth  of  rural  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs); (iii) rural infrastructure improvements, including measures to reduce natural and human \ninduced shocks; and (iv) improved access to information and communications technology (ICT). \nDiversification and off-farm employment promotion are the two pillars of the Government\u2019s \nagriculture and rural development strategy.  \n \nD.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n  \n4.  To foster a diversified rural economy and reduce rural poverty, more attention will be \npaid  to  improving  rural  roads  and  waterways  to  connect  poor  rural  communities  to  major \nmarkets. Assistance will be provided to fund the maintenance of feeder roads and rural roads. \nLow-cost  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  schemes  will  be  promoted  actively  and  included, \nwhere feasible. Transfer of ownership and responsibility for maintenance will be delegated to \nlocal governments, where possible.

As applied by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) in the course of \nthe  feasibility  study,  the  selection  of  subprojects  for  the  Second  Rural  Infrastructure \nImprovement  Project  (the  Project)  started  with  participatory  discussions  with  local  target \nbeneficiaries. Subdistrict engineers consulted with the members of union councils regarding \nrural roads and markets that need improvement in their respective jurisdictions. The country\u2019s \nrural road network was initially constructed as embankments under food-for-work programs in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. The alignments of all proposed roads already exist, and selection of the \nproject roads is confined to these alignments. Due to the serious problems associated with \nacquiring new rights of way, no new road alignment wills be built apart from those on existing \nembankments. \n \n2.  After a list of possible subprojects had been prepared, the proposals are then ranked in \naccordance  with  agreed  criteria.  The  prioritization  criteria  apply  to  the  following  works:  \nsubdistrict and union roads, village roads, growth center markets, jetties, and union council \ncomplexes. The criteria were used in preparing the final list of subprojects included in the \nProject. \n \n3.  The  prioritizing  criteria  fall  under  the  following  five  main  aspects:  (i)  economic,  (ii) \ntechnical/engineering, (iii) equity, (iv) environmental, and (v) social. These are discussed below. \n(i)  Economic. The overarching criterion is that the economic internal rate of return \nfor the selected subproject should be at least 12%. \n(ii)  Technical/engineering criteria. These criteria establish the technical feasibility \nof constructing the subproject.   \n(iii)  Equity. Each subdistrict should have at least one subdistrict road and/or growth \ncenter market. This criteria ensures that the development assistance is equitably \ndistributed to all parts of the project area. \n(iv)  Environmental criteria. Drawn mainly from the Government\u2019s own guidelines in \nproject preparation, these criteria include the following: (a) no subproject will be \nimplemented in the Sundarbans or similarly protected area; (b) the extent of no \nperennial water body is to be reduced below that of February 1995 as a result of \nthe Project; (c) no registered historic building or cultural sites would be adversely \naffected; and (d) land acquisition should be minimal. \n(v)  Social criteria. Subprojects that qualify on the basis of the first four criteria are \nthen  screened  further  based  each  subproject\u2018s  contribution  to  achieving  the \nbroad goals of the Project in (a) poverty reduction, (b) expanding opportunities \nfor women, and (c) minimizing land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n4.  The applicable criteria for each of the major project components are listed below. \n(i)  Subdistrict and union roads. These should \n(a)  have a high degree of connectivity; \n(b)  have an existing crest width of at least 4 meters for their entire length; \n(c)  serve educational institutions, village markets, banks, and other social \ninstitutions; \n(d)  create opportunities for marketing the hinterland\u2019s agricultural, fishery, \nand other products; \n(e)  have  high  potential  for  generating  the  employment  of  poor  men  and \nwomen; \n(f)  serve people living in relatively inaccessible, remote, and poor areas; \n(g)  connect the hinterlands with healthcare and other daily facilities; \n  \n ", "Appendix 7          33 \n \n(h)  improve linkage with the regional transport network including railways and \nwaterways; and \n(i)  have minimal requirements for land allocation and resettlement. \n(ii)  Village roads. These should \n(a)  have a minimum crest width of 2.5 meters, \n(b)  have an existing minimum height that exceeds the highest recorded flood \nin the village and nearby areas, \n(c)  not require land acquisition and resettlement, \n(d)  connect to either a higher-order road that is paved and/or a growth center \nmarket, \n(e)  serve people living in relatively poor and remote areas, and \n(f)  serve people who are willing to participate in the long-term maintenance \nof the road. \n(iii)  Structures on rural roads. \n(a)  All  damaged  bridges  and  culverts  on  selected  subdistrict,  union,  and \nvillage roads will be upgraded. \n(b)  All other existing gaps in the selected subdistrict, union, and village roads \nwill be closed. \n(iv)  Growth centers. These should \n(a)  serve relatively large populations and areas, \n(b)  be  situated  relatively  distant  from  subdistrict  towns  and  other  growth \ncenters, \n(c)  have relatively high concentrations of permanent shops, \n(d)  serve significant education, health and other social institutions, \n(e)  have hinterlands with diversified agriculture and various cash crops, \n(f)  have  relatively  high  potential  for  generating  employment  outside  of \nagriculture, \n(g)  have good communication systems and electricity connections, \n(h)  have scope for physical expansion, \n(i)  have relatively high lease value, \n(j)  be connected to the proposed project road or any other paved road, and \n(k)  have available land for constructing improved market facilities. \n(v)  Jetties. These should \n(a)  be attached to a growth center; \n(b)  connect roads, preferably paved roads, and preferably proposed project \nroads; \n(c)  be used for landing river-borne passengers and goods; \n(d)  be used for multiple purposes; \n(e)  handle a large variety of commodities for in-bound and out-bound traffic; \n(f)  have relatively low vulnerability to river erosion; and \n(g)  have high lease revenue. \n(vi)  Union council complexes. These should  \n(a)  be connected to the project road system, \n(b)  be centrally located in the union area, \n(c)  have no existing premises or old, damaged office buildings, \n(d)  be located in a market place and served by other offices, \n(e)  have an electricity connection, and \n(f)  be ready to contribute the equivalent of 5% of the construction cost  to be \nused for complex maintenance. \n \n ", "34          Appendix 8 \nLESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS ADB-ASSISTED PROJECTS \nIN THE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \n \nA.  Introduction  \n1.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) direct financial assistance to the rural infrastructure \nsector of Bangladesh started in 1988 with the approval of Loan No. 908-BAN (SF), the (first) \nRural Infrastructure Development Project, also known as RDP-13 in the Government official \nrecords1 and RIDP-1 in ADB. Following the successful implementation of RIDP-1, three other \nprojects in the sector have been similarly assisted by ADB.2 This appendix briefly describes \neach of previous projects in terms of its major focus or components, financing amount, and \nfinancing arrangements, as well as the various lessons learned in implementing the projects. \n \nB.

The stronger focus among the earlier projects (RIDP-1 and RIDP-2) on the physical \ndevelopment of infrastructure vis-\u00e0-vis institutional strengthening is quite evident. Even among \nthe civil works items, the development of physical infrastructure that would help strengthen local \ngovernance came somewhat later.

Lessons Learned From Each Project3 \n \n3.  The project completion report (PCR) of RIDP-14 lists the following lessons learned from \nimplementing the project: \n(i)  To further improve the quality of road construction in ongoing and future projects, \nthe design for each road length should be finalized only after thorough examination \nof the anticipated traffic volume and the soil texture, especially the subgrade. \n(ii)  Continued training and equipment support should be provided to small-scale \ncontractors, as many of them have limited experience and inadequate financial \nresources  to  purchase  expensive  construction  equipment  such  as  aggregate \nspreaders and tired rollers. \n(iii)  More realistic scheduling of preparatory work\u2014particularly in regard to securing \nneeded Government budgetary allocations, recruiting consultants, and procuring \nconstruction  equipment\u2014should  be  carried  out  to  allow  for  implementation \nuncertainties and avoid delays in project start up. \n(iv)  To further improve the quality of benefit monitoring and evaluation, a benchmark \nsurvey of the project area should be carried out during project preparation. The \nLocal  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  capability  in  this  regard \nneeds to be enhanced. \n(v)  To increase the revenue available for operating and maintaining rural markets, the \nleasing procedures currently used for rural markets should be strengthened to \nallow for greater transparency, competition, and beneficiary participation.  \n \n4.  The project completion report of RIDP-2,5 lists the following lessons learned: \n(i)  The local people were not fully aware of the use of the office buildings provided \nfor  the  union  market  management  committee.  Involving  local  government \ninstitutions (LGIs) and local residents in project design and implementation is \nrequisite to the sustainability of project facilities. \n(ii)  An adequate number of local contractors is not available in rural areas. Providing \nrepeated  training  for  contractors  effectively  enhances  their  capability  and \nimproves the quality of their work. The lease rates for construction equipment \nwere low relative to prevailing market rates, prompting some contractors to keep \nthe leased equipment on site without using it. The equipment would be better \nutilized and maintained if owned by contractors. \n(iii)   The  involvement  of  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs)  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) helped increase participation and users\u2019 responsibility in \nconstructing  and  maintaining  rural  infrastructure.  This  provided  employment \nopportunities  to  destitute  rural  women  and  encouraged  many  of  them  to \nparticipate in the development work \n(iv)  Lengthy internal Government procedures contributed to delays in project start up, \nparticularly in regard to recruiting consultants and procuring equipment. \n \n                                                 \n3 The specific lessons learned were drawn from the respective project completion reports. While the reports for RDP-\n1 and -2 have been published, the report for RIDP-3 is under preparation. RIIP-1 is still under implementation.  \n4 ADB. 1999.

Project Completion Report on the Second Rural Infrastructure Development Project in Bangladesh. \nManila. (Report No. IN.200-02). \n \n ", "36          Appendix 8 \n5.  The draft project completion report prepared by LGED for RIDP-3 lists the following \nlessons learned: \n(i)  The participatory approach to project planning and implementation contributes \nsignificantly in ensuring the sustainability of development initiatives.  \n(ii)  The individual union councils should enhance their local resource mobilization \nefforts  to  fully  support  the  needs  for  operating  and  maintaining  completed \nfacilities. \n(iii)  Training women in the LCS and other poor women in the project area on possible \nincome-generating activities could effectively help raise the incomes of destitute \nrural families. \n(iv)  Training women traders at the growth center markets and female members of the \nunion council effectively enhanced women\u2019s empowerment.   \n \nD.    Responses to Lessons Learned \n \n6.  In the course of packaging its development assistance to the rural infrastructure sector, \nADB has endeavored to work with LGED and other agencies concerned to carry out most of the \nrecommendations implied in the lessons above. Among the relevant steps taken by LGED and \nother agencies concerned are the following: \n(i)   Establishing a number of soil laboratories in LGED regional offices has enabled \nadequate soil and material testing prior to actual construction. \n(ii)  Training contractors on contract management and financial management has \nbeen incorporated in every subproject. \n(iii)   LGED  has  adopted  the  participatory  approach  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation as a  standard practice. \n(iv)   LCSs have been engaged to maintain rural roads, plant trees along them, and \nmaintain the trees. \n(v)  Government processing of documents such as the development project proposal \n(formerly called the project proforma) has been advanced to secure counterpart \nfinancing for projects on a timely basis.    \n(vi)  Gender and development principles have been institutionalized in LGED. This is \nmanifested in LGED\u2019s development of gender-sensitive designs for rural markets \nand union council complexes, in which separate sanitary facilities are provided \nfor men and women. LGED has also mandated that contractors pay men and \nwomen laborers equally for equal work. At growth center markets, specialized \nsections averaging 12 stalls per market have been set aside exclusively for \nwomen. \n(vii)  Poverty reduction measures in project design include the direct employment of \npoor unskilled workers from the immediate vicinity of the project and training local \nyouths of both sexes on livelihood projects, handicrafts, and future employment \nopportunities. \n \n7.  To prepare local government units to assume greater responsibility in governance, rural \ninfrastructure projects implemented after RIDP-2 invariably include provisions for enhancing the \nphysical facilities of LGIs, as well as training for members and officials of union councils on their \nresponsibilities,  financial  management,  participatory  approaches  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation, and poor people\u2019s participation in local decision making. \n ", "Appendix 9          37 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \nA.

Introduction \n1.  The country strategy for Bangladesh of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) identifies \nliving in remote and unfavorable environments with limited transport and other infrastructure as \na major cause of poverty. The national strategy for poverty reduction in Bangladesh gives high \npriority  to  developing  roads  and  related  infrastructure.  The  Second  Rural  Infrastructure \nImprovement Project (the Project) directly addresses the problem associated with the lack of \nconnectivity between the rural areas where most people live and the areas that offer economic \nopportunities to the rural poor. \nB.  Project Benefits \n2.  The project benefits will be generated from (i) the directly quantifiable benefits arising \nfrom savings in vehicle operating costs, discussed in part C below, and (ii) the indirect benefits \nthat are not quantified in the economic evaluation but are likely to be quite significant. These \nbenefits are discussed below. \n  1.  Improved Access and Reduced Poverty \n3.   Like many rural areas in Bangladesh, the project area suffers from general isolation.  \nAreas of agricultural production have no year-round access to either markets or sources of \ntechnical services. Bringing produce to an existing paved road typically takes hours of travel on \nfoot  or  by  bullock  cart.  Visits  by  agricultural extension  services  are  few  and  far  between.  \nWomen  and  children  in  particular  suffer  from  the  lack  of  access  to  health  and  education \nservices, which are reliably available only in larger towns. Although some available rural labor \nmay be willing to undertake off-farm activities, the lack of access to alternative employment \nprevents them from engaging in any such gainful jobs. Largely due to the lack of access to \neconomic opportunities, the project area suffers from a high incidence of poverty (about 55% of \nrural population in 2000, the latest year for which data exists) and child labor. With the Project, \nthe level of poverty is expected to drop by 7%, with child labor declining considerably. \n4.  The Project aims to improve the network of rural roads, rural markets, and union council \noffices in 23 districts of Bangladesh. These physical works will link the rural population and \nagricultural production areas with places offering broader economic and social opportunities. \nThe economic opportunities have the following dimensions: \n \n(i)  Rural labor will become more mobile and able to combine farm employment with \noff-farm work in nearby urban communities. \n(ii)  Agricultural producers will become more market oriented and adjust agricultural \nproduction decisions in line with the goal of maximizing profits. \n(iii)  Greater  access  for  poor  children to  education,  and  of  poor  youths  to  skills-\ndevelopment programs, will build the foundation for forming a skilled labor force \nwith long-term benefits for the economy and labor market. \n(iv)  Social services, such as education and healthcare, and technical services such \nas agricultural extension and access to new technology (including high-yielding \nseed varieties and fertilizers) will be more easily available.  \n(v)  With improved market facilities, fresh produce will be more readily available at \nmarket centers with minimal spoilage. The expanding economic opportunities will \nhelp in sustaining poverty-reduction efforts in the project area. \n  \n ", "Appendix 10          41 \n \n  2.  Local Governance Improvement \n \n5.  The  improvement  of  local  governance  under  the  Project  will  be  achieved  by  (i) \nempowering women and (ii) giving greater responsibility to the local government units (union \ncouncils, or UCs) and, through them, to the people. The empowerment of women will be \nattained by first providing them needed skills (e.g., in management and retail trade) and then \ngiving them the opportunity to apply those skills (e.g., in managing their own shops in the rural \nmarkets). Apart from this, women members of UCs will be trained in development planning and \nfinancial  management  to  make  them  better  able  to  contribute  to  decision-making  in  UCs, \nparticularly on issues involving women. Women will also be given training on income-generating \nactivities to expand their opportunities to earn family income. This assistance to women in the \nproject area, along with the requirement that contractors pay equal wages to men and women \nfor the same work value, will gradually narrow the gender gap in Bangladesh. \n6.  Strengthening the capacity of UCs will, in the long run, prepare them to assume broader \nresponsibilities  in  participatory  governance  and  the  decentralization  of  financial  and \nadministrative authority. Under the Project, following a series of training programs for members \nand officers of UCs, they will be tasked with preparing proposals for improving village roads in \ntheir respective jurisdictions. Funds will be made available under the Project for this purpose.  \nUCs that perform well in implementing their first village road will be entitled to additional funds to \nimprove more village roads. The performance-based incentive will be institutionalized under the \nProject to encourage UCs to improve the quality of their work. Emulating best practices will be \nencouraged by inviting neighboring UCs to visit and learn from each other. On the whole, the \nimprovement  in  local  governance  under  the  Project  will  enhance  its  pro-poor  focus.  The \nstronger local government units, along with their clear ownership of the Project, will help ensure \nthe sustainability of project facilities. \n  3.  Other Benefits \n \n7.  Apart from the benefits from the rural roads and markets, the Project will contribute to \nthe general well-being of rural populations in various ways. Providing submersible roads will \nreduce the travel time during the dry season in low-lying areas. Constructing jetties will facilitate \nthe safe loading and unloading of goods and passengers. The construction of flood refuge \nshelters will save the lives and property of the rural people living in the flood-prone areas. The \nconstruction  of  UC  complexes  will  provide  one-stop  services  to  rural  people.  The  human \nresource development program proposed under various components of the Project will increase \nthe knowledge and skills of various population groups, particularly women. \n \nC.  Economic Evaluation \n \n1.  Economic Analysis of Rural Roads \n8.  In conducting an economic analysis of roads, the following steps were taken:  \n \na.  Assessment of Road Condition, Existing Traffic, and Traffic Growth \n \n9.  Road  roughness  is  measured  by  the  international  roughness  index  in  meters  per \nkilometer (m/km). For economic analysis, the difference between earth and paved roads in their \nexisting condition has been taken into account. For bitumen-surfaced roads, the international \nroughness index (IRI) is 10 m/km; on herringbone bond roads, the IRI is 14 m/km; and for \nearthen roads, 18 m/km. These IRI values were assumed under the \u201cwithout project\u201d condition \n \n ", "42          Appendix 10 \nover the project period. For \u201cwith Project\u201d roads, an average lifetime IRI pf 4 m/km is assumed. \nAverage annual daily traffic was calculated considering the number of market and non-market \ndays in a year and adjusted for seasonal changes. Traffic growth is assumed to be 6.50% a \nyear, somewhat less than the national traffic growth rate of 7.34% per year.1 The existing traffic \nis assumed to represent traffic volume without the Project. Traffic volume with the Project was \nset as equivalent to the existing traffic plus generated traffic, the latter being assumed to be \n50%  of  traffic  volume  without  project.  This  level  of  generated  traffic  is  considered  to  be \nconservative since additional traffic volume in recently completed projects similar to the Project \nhas ranged from about 70% to over 100%.2 \n \nb.  Estimation of Costs  \n10.  The economic costs of rural roads under the Project include the cost of upgrading \nexisting, generally earthen roads to bitumen-paved condition in line with LGED standards. The \ninvestment cost, annual routine cost of maintenance, and the cost of periodic maintenance \ncarried out every 5 years were included in the costs estimates. Physical contingencies, but not \nprice escalation, were included in the economic costs. The financial costs were converted to \neconomic  costs  by  first  deducting  taxes  and  duties,  adding  physical  contingency  and \nmanagement costs, and then applying the standard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n \n    c.  Estimation of Benefits \n \n11.  The major source of benefits from improving rural roads is savings in vehicle operating \ncosts (VOC) over the smoother road surface for vehicles of all types. The incremental benefit \nincreases at the rate corresponding to the traffic growth rate of 6.5 percent. The normal benefit \n(i.e., the benefit accruing from the existing traffic due to VOC reduction) is estimated to be 40% \nof the total benefits in the third year, 70% in the fourth year, and full from the fifth year. \nAdditional benefits that will be realized but not quantified in the present analyses are increased \nagricultural income arising from higher fertilizer use due to its lower delivered price, greater use \nof high-yielding crop varieties, and higher market prices for agricultural produce.  \n \n    d.   Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n \n12.  The economic analysis takes account of the different times at which project costs are \nincurred and benefits accrue. For any given subproject, the costs are mainly incurred during the \nfirst 2\u20135 years, while benefits start to flow in the third year, as indicated above, and achieve their \nfull level by the fifth year of the Project. The period of analyses is set at 20 years. The economic \ncosts are compared with the economic benefits, and the net benefits are used to calculate the \nEIRR. \n \n  2.  Results of Economic Analysis of Roads \n \n13.  The  economic  analysis  of  three  core  subdistrict  roads  was  performed  using  the \nprocedures discussed above. EIRR analysis found all three roads to be economically viable. \nThe  Churkhi\u2013Dapunia  road  will  generate  the  highest  benefit,  followed  by  the  Tarakanda\u2013\nShyamgonj road. The Mominpur\u2013Keranirhat road will generate the least benefit among the three \nsample subdistrict roads but will still generate a rate of return of more than 12%. The results of \nalternative scenarios showed the changes in EIRR to be minimal.  \n                                                 \n1 Roads and Highways Department, Government of Bangladesh. 2003.

Economic Analysis of Growth Center Markets \n  a.  Introduction \n \n14.  Growth  center  markets  (GCMs)  are  the  focal  points  for  the  sale  of  rural  produce, \nagricultural inputs, and consumer goods. In addition to GCMs there are also other small rural \nmarkets. Unimproved markets are congested, unhygienic, dusty in the dry season, and muddy \nin the wet season. Improved markets provide clean, uncongested, and efficient places for \ntrading  farm  and  other  products.  In  the  present  Project,  three  types  of  markets  will  be \ndeveloped: (i) GCMs located at subdistrict headquarters, (ii) GCMs not located at subdistrict \nheadquarters, and (iii) small rural markets not designated as GCMs. Due to population growth \nand the increased trading of farm and other goods in the rural areas, demand for the third \ncategory of local markets has increased.  \n \n    b.  Methodology of Economic Analysis  \n \n15.  Economic analysis of GCMs was as followed: \n \ni.  Estimating the Costs \n \n16.  The  economic  costs  of  GCMs  under  the  Project  include  the  cost  of  construction, \nincluding  of  women\u2019s  market  section.  Along  with  the  investment  cost,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs  were  included  in  the  estimates.  Physical  contingencies,  but  not  price \nescalation,  were  included  in  the  economic  costs.  The  financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic  costs  by  first  deducting  taxes  and  duties,  adding  physical  contingency  and \nmanagement costs, and then applying the standard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n \n \n      ii.  Estimation of Benefits \n \n17.  A spoilage savings approach was used to quantify benefits. Spoilage savings are the \nportion of revenue lost to the seller as a result of product quality deterioration. The benefit is the \ndifference in spoilage savings of perishable goods in the market with and without the Project \nand calculated on the basis of number of peak and off-peak days in a year. It is assumed that \n \n ", "44          Appendix 10 \nspoilage will reduce by 60% with the Project.3 The remaining 40% of the benefits will accrue \nfrom population growth and improved transport facilities. Benefits are expected to be generated \nfrom  the  second  year  of  the  improvement  on  the  markets,  with  benefits  increasing  at  a \ncompounded rate of 8% per year. \n \n    c.  Results of Economic Analysis  \n \n18.  The results of the economic analysis of the core subproject GCM, GCMs located at \nsubdistrict headquarters, and GCMs located outside of subdistrict headquarters are discussed \nbelow. \n \n    i.  The Core Subproject Growth Center Market \n \n19.  One  GCM\u2014Mominpur,  located  at  Rangpur  Sadar\u2014was  selected  to  illustrate  the \nprocedure for economic analysis. A market survey was conducted at this site, annual spoilage \nsavings  calculated,  and  benefits  estimated,  yielding  an  EIRR  of  17.87%.  This  is  quite \nsatisfactory  and  justifies  investments  in  this  component  of  the  Project.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshowed that, if maintenance cost was doubled, the EIRR decreased to 12.57%. If averted \nspoilage was reduced to 45% from the assumed 60%, the EIRR fell to 12.08.    \n \nTable A10.2: Results of Economic Analysis of 10 GCMs Located at Subdistrict \nHeadquarters \n \nDistrict  Subdistrict  Name of the Market  EIRR \nDinajpur  Nawabgonj   1.

Growth Center Markets Located at Subdistrict Headquarters \n \n20.  Under  the  Project,  30  GCMs  located  at  subdistrict  headquarters  will  be  improved. \nEconomic analyses for 10 were available for the feasibility study report conducted by the LGED. \nThe findings are summarized in Table A10.2, showing that the EIRR of each of the 10 markets \nis well above 12%, ranging from 15.49% to, for four of them, over 50.00%. These high rates of \nreturn justify investments in GCMs.   \n \nd.  Project Benefit Distribution \n \n21.  A benefits distribution analysis was carried out to determine what portions of the benefits \naccrue to each group of beneficiaries, particularly to the poor. The beneficiaries of the Project \n                                                 \n3 LGED. 2004. Feasibility Study Report on Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project-2.

The poverty impact ratio (PIR) was calculated to measure \nthe proportion of the benefits from subdistrict roads, rural roads, and rural markets that would \naccrue to the poor (the detailed procedures are in Supplementary Appendix K). The results are \nshown below: \n \nTable A10.3: Poverty Impact Ratio \n \nSources of Benefits  PIR (%) \nSubdistrict Roads  50.4 \nUnion Roads  43.8 \nRural Markets  30.1 \nPIR = poverty impact ratio. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  The results show that the poor will benefit most from the subdistrict roads. Although the \nbenefits to the poor from union roads and rural markets are lower, they are still substantial. \n \n    e.  Project Sustainability \n \n23.  To ensure the sustainability of the facilities constructed, the Project will (i) continue to \nenhance the capability of local government units to better manage rural infrastructure in their \njurisdiction;  (ii)  monitor  the  allocations  to  LGED  for  road  maintenance  from  the  central \nGovernment so that the maintenances gap will ultimately narrow; (iii) pursue labor-intensive, \ncost-effective maintenance procedures in LGED to ensure the sustainability of rural roads; (iv) \nensure the participation of local government units in the maintenance of union complexes, thus \nstrengthening their sense of ownership of the project; and (v) reorganize market management \ncommittees with a view to ensuring the efficient maintenance of rural market facilities with funds \nfrom market leases. \n \n \n \n ", "46          Appendix 11                     \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

As mentioned in the draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), improved \ninfrastructure is critical to poverty reduction, as physical infrastructure services enhance the capabilities of the poor and help \nthem avail themselves of the economic opportunities of growth. Constructing and improving roads, growth center markets \n(GCMs), and jetties\u2014and improving their operation and maintenance\u2014play important roles in reducing rural poverty by \ncreating new employment opportunities for poor men and women and so enhancing incomes for the poor, facilitating quick \nand cost-effective transportation of perishable agricultural commodities to urban markets, and enabling the easy availability \nof agricultural inputs at reasonable prices. Improved Union Council complexes (UCCs) are expected to bring central \nGovernment services closer to the people. The Project will help reduce poverty by creating sustainable seasonal and long-\nterm employment opportunities for the poor. Paved roads will encourage the start of bus and truck services in which the poor \nwill find employment as drivers, conductors, and helpers. Some new employment will also be created in non-motorized \ntransport. The improved growth centers and small markets along the improved roads are expected to serve landless and \nmarginal farmers by making daily necessities available to those who have earned wages. The Project will benefit other \nsegments of the population, including small traders. Infrastructure construction and improvement undertaken by the Project \nwill directly generate about 52,830 person-years of employment for the poor, 30% of them for women.  \n \nB.

The impact of the Project on poverty will be measured using some \neconomic and social indicators: (i) changes in household well-being (income, consumption expenditure, and household \nassets); (ii) changes in work, employment, and wages (type of work, employment, job turnover, and average daily wage); (iii) \nchanges in production (crops, small business, prices, etc.); (iv) changes in social structure, status, and behavior (family size, \noccupation of household head, mobility, migration, and community activity); and (v) changes in health and educational \noutcomes. The benchmark poverty situation will be assessed with a baseline survey before the Project begins. Follow-up \nsurveys will be carried out for comparison with the benchmark situation.   \n \nAlthough in decline, the incidence of poverty is still very high in Bangladesh. According to the household income and \nexpenditure survey of 2000, about 50% of the population in the countryside live below the upper poverty line, and 34% live \nbelow the lower poverty line. Both measures are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The incidence of poverty nationally \ndeclined by about 1% annually in the 1990s; further declines of the same magnitude were reported from 1999 to 2004. The \ndistribution of poverty by division, as estimated by both the measures using head-counts, shows Rajshahi Division with the \nhighest poverty incidence, followed by Khulna and Dhaka. The incidence of poverty was lowest in Barisal and Chittagong.   \n \nAnalyses of poverty in the project districts shows the highest incidence in the districts in Rajshahi Division. Compared with \nthe national average of 34% in 2000, more than 38% of the people in these districts were found to live below the lower \npoverty line. In the districts of Gaibandha and Kurigram, the rate was even higher, at more than 40%. Factors responsible for \nhigh poverty in these areas are (i) sandy soils, as substantial areas of Gaibandha and Kurigram are char (accreted) land, \nwhere about 2 million people live; (ii) low crop yields and limited scope for double or triple cropping; (iii) slow adoption of \ntechnology due to low literacy; (iv) seasonal joblessness with limited off-farm activities; (v) excessive flooding and river bank \nerosion; and (vi) limited infrastructure.  \n \nThe incidence of poverty is also high in several districts of Dhaka Division, particularly Netrokona, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, \nSherpur, and Kishoregonj, where 32% to 38% of the people live below the lower poverty line (Bangladesh Planning \nCommission and World Food Program). The districts bordering India (Sherpur, Jamalpur, Mymensingh, and Netrokona) are \nfrequently affected by flash floods.  Moreover, a sizable area of Netrokona and Kishoregonj districts are located in haor \n(perennial wetland) areas, which remain under water for about 8 months and allow only one crop to be grown. These areas \nmay also be affected by early floods. Except three urbanized districts\u2014Dhaka, Narayanganj, and Gazipur, where the \nincidence of poverty is less than 20%\u2014the poverty in other districts is moderate, at 20\u201330%. The low incidence of poverty in \nthe urbanized districts is due to relatively good infrastructure and other facilities. \n  \n ", "Appendix 11          47\n \nThe Project will create substantial economic opportunities for the rural poor, who will get employment opportunities in \ninfrastructure construction and maintenance. A total of 52,830 person-years of employment opportunities will be created for \nunskilled laborers, of which 30% will be women. \n \nRoad networks will create employment for many poor people, including transport workers (operators, drivers, and helpers), \nancillary support and service providers, and small traders. When roads are improved, vehicle operating costs for motorized \nand other vehicles will decline. The operators are poor, especially those of non-motorized vehicles. Their journeys will \nbecome more frequent, enhancing their income. \n \nThe general population, particularly women and children, will have better access to social service facilities and institutions \nincluding education, healthcare, microfinance and small enterprises. Travel time will shorten. With improved transport \nfacilities, farm gate prices for agricultural commodities will increase, and farmers will be able to get agricultural inputs at \nreasonable prices. Environmental conditions in GCM areas will significantly improve. Microfinance agencies, including \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), will be encouraged to expand their credit and other income-generating activities in the \nproject areas. This will benefit the poor immensely. \n \nC.      Participation Process \n   \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \u22a0 Yes  \u25a1 No  Is there a participation strategy?  \u22a0 Yes  \u25a1 No \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted through a series of regional and union-level workshops, as well as through focus \ngroup discussions with groups of stakeholders at three core subproject sites. The consultations helped to identify both the \nsupply side (service providers) and demand side (beneficiaries) stakeholders. The former group includes funding agencies; \nLocal Government Engineering Department (LGED) staff; administrative staff; government workers in different departments \nat the district, subdistrict, and union level; NGOs and community-based organizations; and contractors and local government \nofficials. The demand group includes farmers, retail traders and businessmen, small entrepreneurs, wholesale traders, \nwoman traders, poor and vulnerable women, rickshaw pullers and van drivers, transport owners, school and college \nteachers, and students. The proposed participation strategy includes  \n(i)  mobilizing community groups concerned, including women, through extensive campaigns about the project \ncomponents and the accruable benefits, as well as their roles and responsibilities, so that they can develop a sense \nof ownership toward the project;  \n(ii)  provisions to build the capacity of officers and members of local government units on participatory approaches and \nparticipatory supervision and monitoring of project activities; \n(iii)  provision for women\u2019s representation in all project management committees; \n(iv)  provision of appropriate facilities for women in union council (UC) complexes that will facilitate their participation in \nlocal governance; \n(v)  arrangements for poor women, through labor contracting societies (LCSs) to participate in road maintenance, tree \nplanting, and tree maintenance; \n(vi)  provision of training LCS members on income-generating skills; \n(vii) instituting and strengthening the participatory skills and capabilities of the staff members of LGED, the Executing \nAgency, by imparting training on participatory tools and techniques, so that they can effectively promote and guide \nparticipatory practices under the Project; and \n(viii) provision for developing a sustainable monitoring and evaluation mechanism in LGED to periodically assess the \nimpact of the Project on the livelihood of the targeted poor community members.     \nD.      Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe major infrastructure developed under the Project will empower women. Constructing rural roads will improve the mobility \nof women and benefit them as users of markets, UCCs and roads. Short-term and seasonal employment in improving and \nmaintaining infrastructure will be created. Employment generation for women will take place in women market sections, in \nopen sheds of GCMs, and in construction work as laborers. The extensive participation of poor women under the Project is \nlargely in line with the national policy of the Government in reducing poverty highlighted in the PRSP. The Project will \npromote the effective participation of women in governance and facilitate strengthening the role of female UC members by \nproviding training and capacity building to plan and coordinate different activities. The Project will help female UC members \nbecome involved in development activities and union development coordination committees, as they will receive training to \nbetter understand their roles and responsibilities. The Project will continue to mainstream gender issues in LGED. \nHas an output been prepared?                        \u22a0 Yes          \u25a1  No  \n \nA detailed gender action plan has been prepared. \n \n ", "48          Appendix 11 \nE.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  resettlement  framework  provides  the  basis  for  preparing  resettlement  plans  for \nspecific subprojects as may be required under the Second Rural Infrastructure Improvement \nProject  (the  Project).  It  identifies  the  broad  scope  of  the  Project  and  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures, and institutional requirements for formulating resettlement plans for subprojects. As \nthe Executing Agency for the Project, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is \nresponsible for preparing and implementing the resettlement plans in line with the resettlement \nframework. \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework \n \n2.  The current legislation governing land acquisition in Bangladesh is the Acquisition and \nRequisition of Immovable Property Ordinance 1982 and subsequent amendments. The 1982 \nordinance recognizes only the legal owners of land and property but does not cover project-\naffected people without formal title, such as squatters, occupiers, and informal tenants and lease-\nholders without registered deeds. The law also does not ensure compensating the replacement \nvalue of the property acquired. \n \n3.  In the absence of a national resettlement policy in Bangladesh, the Government has \nadopted the policy of funding agencies on involuntary resettlement. This ensures that people \naffected  by  land  acquisition  will  be  eligible  for  appropriate  compensation  and  resettlement \nbenefits. People with no legal title who lose land to the project will be provided with compensation \nand resettlement benefits. Customary rights to land and physical property will also be recognized, \nincluding leases on homestead, commercial and agricultural land, sharecroppers, and renters of \nland and structures.  \n \n4.  The framework bridges the gaps between Government and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  policies  and  endorses  an  income-restoration  strategy  for  vulnerable  affected  people, \nincluding squatters, irrespective of legal title to the affected property. \n \nTable A12: Measures for Compliance with ADB Policy and Government Laws \nAssessment  1982 Land Acquisition Act and Subsequent  Asian Development Bank Policy \nAmendments (Government Policy) \nLoss of land/  Loss of land, structure, tree/crop is assessed  Loss of land, structure, tree/crop, and \nstructure/tree/ crops/  and the title holders are identified as per legal  income of the title and non-title holders \nincome and the  provisions of law and through joint  are identified by socioeconomic survey \nowners  verification.a  and verified by a joint verification team \n(JVT).b \nValuation of affected  Compensation as per sale value of land  Replacement value at current market \nproperty  recorded in the sub-registrars' office and rate  price is recommended by the project-\nfixed by Public Works Departmentc for  specific VAT.d Non-asset losses (viz. \nstructures and by Department of Forests and  income and dislocation) are also \nDepartment of Agricultural Extension for  assessed, and restoration supports are \ntrees/crops, with a 50% premium in all cases.   provided. \nJVT = joint verification team, VAT = valuation advisory team. \na Joint verification of affected property by acquiring and requiring bodies. \nb Joint verification team formed by the Ministry of LGRD. \nc Public Works Department maintains updated rates of different structure items.  \nd Project-specific property valuation advisory team is formed by the line Ministry. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  \n ", "50          Appendix 12 \n5.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \nconsultation with the affected people and other stakeholders. All efforts will be made to minimize \ndisplacement during subproject planning and implementation, and the preferences of affected \npeople will be taken into account. An entitlement matrix (Supplementary Appendix Y), prepared \non the basis of potential resettlement impacts at three core subprojects, identifies the categories \nof impact based on surveys carried out on the tentative right of way and shows the entitlements \nfor each type of loss. If new impacts are subsequently identified during detailed design, these \nlosses will be included in the entitlement matrix, and the resettlement plan will be appropriately \nrevised.  \n \nC.  Preparation and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n \n6.  Resettlement plans for selected subprojects will be prepared and implemented as needed. \nThe  resettlement  plans  will  be  reviewed  by  LGED  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence. If impacts on indigenous people are identified in any of the subproject areas, the \nresettlement plan for the subproject will include special action for affected indigenous people. The \nresettlement plan prepared for the sample subproject will be used as a model for the preparation \nof  subsequent  resettlement  plans.  Resettlement  plans  must  comply  with  ADB  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  other  social  safeguard  policies,  including  consultation  with  the \npeople  affected,  which  will  provide  local  insights  for  establishing  safety  net  mechanisms. \nPreparation of a resettlement plan involves the following procedures: (i) collecting socioeconomic \ninformation, (ii) valuating affected property, (iii) assessing gender impacts, (iv) disclosing the plan \nto stakeholders, (v) redressing grievances if any, and (vi) paying actual compensation. These \nprocedures are described below. \n1.  Collection of Socioeconomic Data \n \n7.  With  the  help  of  the  resettlement  specialist,  LGED  will  undertake  social  surveys  of  \nsubproject areas, including a full census of the households and physical establishments requiring \nrelocation.  An  agricultural  land  survey  will  study  a  20%  sample  of  plots,  and  a  detailed \nsocioeconomic survey of 20% of the households and other establishments to be relocated will be \ncarried out. The socioeconomic survey will establish baseline information on household incomes, \noccupational and livelihood patterns, resettlement needs and responses, social organization, \ncommunity organization, and cultural parameters in the subproject area. LGED will ensure that \nappropriate entitlements and mitigation measure are established in the resettlement plans in \naccordance with the resettlement framework. If the impact is significant\u2014i.e., the number of \npeople  physically  displaced  or  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  income  is  200  or  more\u2014a  full \nresettlement plan will be prepared. If the impact is insignificant, affecting fewer than 200 people, a \nshort resettlement plan will be sufficient. If no involuntary resettlement effects are foreseen, no \nresettlement plan will be prepared.1  \n  2.  Valuation of Property \n8.  Losses and impacts on affected people due to land acquisition and involuntary relocation \nwill be assessed by LGED through a resettlement survey covering titled and non-titled owners of \nthe affected property, including their loss of income and employment. Affected property will be \nquantified through joint verification carried out by the acquiring and requiring parties, and the date \nof verification will be considered the cut off date for physical losses eligible for compensation \nunder  law.  The  land  acquisition  section  of  the  district  administrations  will  fix  the  cash \ncompensation  under  law  as  per  the  land  acquisition  act.  To  determine  and  ensure  the \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2/OP: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila (29 October, page 5).  \n ", "Appendix 12          51 \n \nreplacement market price of the affected property, LGED will organize a property  valuation \nadvisory team (PVAT) and assess the replacement market value of all the affected property.  \n  3.  Gender Impact \n9.  The social surveys should identify gender issues in the production system both on farms \nand in nonagricultural activities. Since legal ownership of land does not reflect gender compliance \nin case of spouses, sufficient measures should be included in the resettlement plans to ensure \nspouses rights and social safety. The measures should (i) identify the socioeconomic condition, \nneeds, and priorities of women and monitor and evaluate the impact of land acquisition and \nresettlement on women separately; (ii) identify female-headed households to be affected and set \nentitlement criteria to recognize them; (iii) provide resources in kind (land, structures, etc.) in the \nname of both spouses of the households to be affected; and (iv) involve women's groups in \nresettlement planning, management, and operations and in job creation and income generation.  \n  4.  Disclosing and Consultation    \n10.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders. The resettlement framework will be made available in Bangla for affected people in \nthe planning phase, so that their views on the Project, its resettlement impact, and the mitigation \nmeasures  are  known  to  the  planners  and  incorporated  into  the  planning  documents.  The \nresettlement plans will be translated into Bangla and disclosed to affected people at the start of \nresettlement implementation. Affected people (including the women and vulnerable groups), local \ngovernment, and civil society representatives will participate in assessing the resettlement impact \nand mitigating measures.  \n  5.  Grievance Redress \n11.  Primary responsibility for addressing grievances rests with LGED. In the event that LGED \nis  unable  to  resolve  a  complaint,  it  might  be  referred  to  the  grievance  redress  committee \nestablished for each subproject, with representatives from LGED, affected people, women and \nvulnerable  groups,  local  government  and  nongovernment  organizations.  A  contractor \nrepresentative should attend hearings of the grievance redress committee. The resettlement \nofficer or his nominee will chair the grievance redress committee. Other than disputes related to \nownership  rights,  the  committee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits, \nrelocation, and relevant assistance. Grievances will be redressed within 2\u20134 weeks from the \ncomplaint being lodged.  \n  6.  Compensation \n12.  For the purpose of compensating affected persons, LGED will prepare land acquisition \nproposals with the help of consultants and submit them to the respective deputy commissioners \nfor processing. The market price from the sub-registrar's office will be collected in a pre-designed \nformat  certified  by  the  sub-registrars.  District  LGED  representatives  will  accompany \nrepresentatives from the consultants in the joint verification and price fixing process led by the \ndeputy commissioner. With representatives from LGED and the deputy commissioners, PVATs \nwill determine the replacement market price of land, structures, and trees and will recommend the \nreplacement price for approval by LGED. The recommendation will ensure the replacement price \nof land and property at current market value. The resettlement framework includes an income-\nrestoration strategy for vulnerable affected people, including squatters, irrespective of their legal \ntitle to affected property. People involuntarily separated from their homes, assets, or income \nsources, as well as non-titled people affected by the Project, will receive a subsistence allowance \nand priority access to income-generating programs.  \n \n \n ", "52          Appendix 12 \nD.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n13.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  budget  includes  the  costs  of  acquiring  assets \nassociated  with  involuntary  resettlement.  The  Government  will  provide  the  funds  for  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  if  needed,  which  will  be  disbursed  through  the  deputy \ncommissioner\u2019s office. The project management office (PMO) will ensure that the land acquisition \nand  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  district  commissioners  for  timely \nimplementation of the resettlement plans. LGED will also ensure that the resettlement plans are \nsubmitted to ADB for concurrence, and that funds for compensation and entitlement under the \nplans are fully provided to affected people prior to the award of the civil works contracts. \n \nE.  Implementing the Resettlement Plans \n \n14.  The Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives, through LGED, \nis  responsible  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  and  financing  of  the \nresettlement plan. With assistance from consultants, LGED will undertake a land acquisition \nsurvey, prepare a land acquisition proposal, carry out resettlement surveys, and prepare a full or \nshort  resettlement  plan  for  each  subproject  according  to  the  significance  of  impact.  The \nresettlement specialist will provide technical support to LGED and supervise and review the field \nactivities. Resettlement plans will be prepared from the first year of the Project through its fifth \nyear. \n15.  The deputy commissioner has the power to acquire land and assess compensation of \nproperties thus acquired. The deputy commissioner acquires the land through the officer or staff \nof the land acquisition office. Along with LGED, the land acquisition officer will conduct joint \nphysical verification of property in accordance with the approved land acquisition proposal to be \nsubmitted by LGED as soon as the detailed design and alignments for the subprojects are \nfinalized. The deputy commissioner offices are responsible for the entire acquisition process, from \nnotification to affected people to awarding of compensation to owners of properties and payments \nof compensation. LGED will liaise with the deputy commissioner offices concerned to complete \nthe land acquisition process in a timely fashion.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n16.  As a part of its overall monitoring system, the PMO will monitor the progress of land \nacquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.  The  PMO  will  report  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement in the quarterly progress report to be submitted to ADB. \n ", "Appendix 13          53 \nSUMMARY GENDER ACTION PLAN (GAP) \n \n1.  The objective of Gender Action Plan1 (GAP) is to increase women\u2019s participation in \ndevelopment  activities,  infrastructure  construction  and  maintenance.  Infrastructures  are \ndesigned to have gender focused services and during implementation those should address \ngender related issues in an effective manner. This gender action plan will equally promote the \nparticipation of men and women stakeholders as change agents and as beneficiaries in the \nproject\u2019s development process with particular attention to (a) women\u2019s poverty reduction and (b) \nwomen\u2019s empowerment to participate in decision making and in public life.  \n \n2.  The Project will ensure women\u2019s participation in infrastructure activities, as users, as \nconstruction  labor  and  in  management  and  maintenance  of  infrastructures.  It  will  promote \nequality in wage for women and men for equal work. Women\u2019s equal participation in public life, \nin social and environmental management and in local governance will also be promoted with \ngreater attention. The GAP attempts to ensure participation of women citizens, adolescent girls, \nstaff of the project, and elected women representatives in project activities at relevant levels. It \nalso provides women to equally access to resources and services, derive benefits from the \nproject services as well as contribute to the development of the community. A summary of \nGender Action Plan is given below: \n \n3.  Specifically, in the Project, the gender issues will be addressed in the following manner: \n \n(i)  In each grown center market (GCM) space will be allocated for construction of \nwomen market section (WMS) where the female traders will run their business. \nThey will be supported to collect and store the homestead products in the WMS \nfor sale. \n(ii)  For the destitute and vulnerable women 15% space at the improved platform will \nbe earmarked for selling their products.  \n(iii)  Employment  of  poor  women  especially  the  project  affected  women  will  be \nensured  in  construction  works  through  labor  contracting  society  (LCS)  and \ncontractors. \n(iv)  The poor women will be employed in road maintenance and tree plantation \nactivities. \n(v)  As  a  part  of  institutional  capacity  building,  the  women  shop  owners  will  be \nencouraged to form an association namely Female Shop Owners Association \n(FSOA) so that they can be represented in the Traders\u2019 Association (TA) and \nMarket Management Committee (MMC). This association will also help women to \nbe represented in the forums related to women\u2019s business and entrepreneurship. \nThe  project  will  organize  skill  development  training,  create  scope  for  wider \nparticipation in trading for potential shop owners, facilitate to establish linkages \nwith different credit-providing agencies. \n(vi)  The  project  will  ensure  elimination  of  wage  differences  between  men  and \nwomen, aiming at the equal working opportunities.  \n(vii)  Micro-financing  agencies  like  Palli  Karma  Shahayak  Foundation  (PKSF), \nBangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB), Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB) \nand other commercial banks and NGOs will be encouraged to extend their credit \n                                                 \n1  The GAP (2006-2011) for the Project was prepared in consultation with the stakeholders and development \npartners, in particular DFID. The detailed actions of the GAP are provided in Supplementary Appendix F, that will \nbe made available upon request. \n ", "54          Appendix 13 \nprogram in the project areas to support the LCS members in income generating \nactivities and female shop owners. \n(viii)  Institutional  linkages  for  the  concerned  stakeholders  will  be  established  to \nsupport women in various issues. These institutions include: (a) Department of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs (DWA) (b) Department of Social Services (DSS) (c) Department \nof Youth Development (DoYD) (d) Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) \n(e) Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) (f) Department of Livestock \n(DOL) (g) Department of Fisheries (DF) (h) Department of Forestry (DoF) (i) \nDepartment  of  Health and  Family  Planning  (DHFP)  (j)  Department  of  Public \nHealth Engineering (DPHE) (k) Department of Agriculture Marketing (DAM) and \ndifferent non government organizations. These offices will be encouraged to \nextend their cooperation for women\u2019s access to extension, technologies, market \npromotion,  credit,  environment,  gender  and  development  (GAD),  good \ngovernance, legal aid, social security and other services.  \n(ix)  The project will help promote and build the capacity of Union Council, especially \nof the female members so that they are able to plan, coordinate and monitor \nsocial and gender related development activities at the project area and can play \nan effective role assigned through the various government circulars.
