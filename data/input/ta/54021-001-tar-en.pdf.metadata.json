INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) for the Promotion of the Northeast \nAsia Power System Interconnection (NAPSI) will support necessary analysis for the first step in \nrealizing NAPSI. It will build on a previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA project that \ndeveloped an overall strategy for NAPSI and demonstrated its value.1 The strategy identified \nseveral steps to realizing NAPSI, the first of which has three components: (i) development of \n5 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind generating capacity in the South Gobi region of Mongolia, \n(ii) construction of a transmission interconnection between South Gobi and northern People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and (iii) construction of an undersea transmission interconnection \nbetween eastern PRC and the Republic of Korea (ROK). This TA will develop a build-out strategy \nfor solar and wind development in the South Gobi region, study alternatives for transmission \nconnections to the PRC and/or the ROK, analyze alternative uses for renewable electricity \ngenerated in the South Gobi region, and support continued multilateral dialogue on Mongolian \nrenewable power in the context of NAPSI. The TA is included in the country operations business \nplan for Mongolia, 2021.2 The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia \n(2021-2024) strategic priority 2 on climate-resilient infrastructure to drive competitiveness and \ndiversification.3   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Greenhouse gas burden and system constraints. The Northeast Asia region4 accounts \nfor 20% of global gross domestic product but is responsible for about 40% of global greenhouse \ngas  (GHG)  emissions.5 Coal,  natural  gas,  and  oil  supplied  70%  of  the  region\u2019s  electricity \ngeneration in 2018.6 Countries in the region are diversifying their energy mixes to replace fossil \nfuel generation with solar, wind, and hydropower generation, which contributes to improved air \nquality and reduced GHG emissions. The PRC is a global leader in renewable energy, accounting \nfor more than one-third of global installed wind and solar electric generating capacity in 2019.7 \nHowever, many other countries in the region face challenges to  expanding their use of renewable \npower because of (i) long distances between high-quality renewable energy resources with large  \neconomic potential and load centers, (ii) grid systems that are not sufficiently robust and flexible \nto integrate higher levels of variable renewable power, and (iii) land constraints that prevent \ndomestic renewable expansion at levels required to reach climate mitigation goals. \n \n3.  Mongolian power system. Coal accounted for 93% of Mongolia\u2019s electricity generation \nin 2018. The Government of Mongolia targets renewable generation reaching 20% of total \ninstalled capacity by 2023 and 30% by 2030. The government is poised to meet the 2023 target \nwith two 50-megawatt (MW) wind farms, two 10 MW solar photovoltaic plants, and more under \nplanning and construction. Mongolia imports 20% of its total electricity supply. A 220-kilovolt (kV) \ntransmission  line  with  245 MW  capacity  from  Selendeuna  in  Buryatia  in  the  the  Russian \n \n1  ADB. 2015.

A 220 kV line from the PRC \nsupplies power to the Oyu Tolgoi mining operations in southern Mongolia, which iare isolated \nfrom the rest of the Mongolian grid. A 220 kV line, operating at 110 kV, from Chadan to \nHandagaoly in the Russian Federation feeds the western region\u2019s energy system, supplying up \nto 75% of electricity consumed in that region, although this will decrease once planned wind and \nsolar plants in Mongolia are commissioned.8 \n \n4.  Mongolia renewable potential and growth in domestic use.  The first NAPSI TA \n(footnote 1) identified tracts of land across Mongolia with high-quality solar and wind energy \npotential, suitable geographic features for development, and proximity to existing infrastructure. \nIt estimated Mongolia\u2019s economically viable renewable power capacity potential at 192 GW of \nwind and 1,166 GW of solar photovoltaic. The TA also developed a least-cost expansion scenario \nof Mongolia\u2019s power system to 2036 considering the 2030 target of 30% renewable capacity \ncontribution. The model showed that solar and wind installed capacity could each contribute \n1.1 GW to Mongolia\u2019s power system at the end of that period, but with significant curtailment of \ngeneration from the new capacity because of the lack of flexible generation assets or grid \nmanagement systems. \n \n5.  Potential for export of renewable power. The potential for development of Mongolia\u2019s \nrenewable  energy  resources  far  exceeds  projected  domestic  demand  and  could  easily \naccommodate development for export markets. The power trade in the Northeast Asia region is \ncurrently limited to bilateral trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC, the Russian \nFederation and Mongolia, and the PRC and Mongolia (para. 3). The South Gobi region has \nextensive tracts of land with high-quality renewable resources that are close to the border with \nthe PRC, a potential buyer of power generated in that region.  \n \n6.  Strategy for NAPSI. The first NAPSI TA analyzed regional power system growth under a \nvariety of scenarios to assess the value of an interconnected approach. The TA considered \nmarkets, technology, resource bases, current power systems, projected demand, and renewable \nenergy targets across Northeast Asian countries, and assumptions were agreed through a \nconsultative multi-stakeholder approach. The study evaluated scenarios for power system growth \nacross the region using an idealized version of the grid where flow was driven by marginal cost \ndifferences. The analysis showed that an interconnected region would result in net savings of \nabout $3 billion per year, compared with a baseline where each country\u2019s power needs are met \nby  domestic  supply.  A  scenario  that  considered  regional  interconnection  plus  100  GW  of \nrenewable generation in the South Gobi region of Mongolia resulted in $10 billion in annual \nsavings compared with the isolated grid case, plus 210 million tons annually of avoided carbon \ndioxide emissions because of substantial displacement of coal and natural gas generation across \nthe region. \n \n7.  First step in building NAPSI. The strategy proposed a stepwise development for NAPSI \nstarting with an initial development of renewable energy capacity in Mongolia\u2019s South Gobi region \nand transmission links connecting the South Gobi to PRC and from PRC to ROK. The NAPSI \nstudy recommended that these be commissioned by 2026 as the first step toward a fully integrated \nregional grid by 2036. Given power shortages in the Seoul region, the link between eastern PRC \nand the ROK is the most pressing. A bilateral agreement to develop this link led to negotiations \nbetween the Korea Electric Power Corporation and the State Grid Corporation of the PRC on joint \ndevelopment of the project. To help the ROK reach climate mitigation goals, the development of \n \n8  UNESCAP. 2018.

Additional analytical needs. The previous TA estimated potential power flows and \nassociated regional benefits under idealized scenarios. However, before proceeding to the first \ninvestment phase, feasibility studies on renewable capacity development and interconnections \nthat  consider  actual  conditions  rather  than  idealized  conditions  are  required.  Furthermore, \npotential commercial structuring for transmission and power purchase agreements should be \nevaluated considering regulatory regimes, capacity of state entities, and opportunities for private \nsector  engagement.  The  potential  benefits  for  each  of  the  countries  should  be  estimated, \ndisaggregating the regional benefits quantified in the previous TA. This TA will analyze the \ncomponents where Mongolia would play a key role in an integrated NAPSI\u2014the renewable power \ngeneration development in the South Gobi region, conceptual analysis of interconnection options \nwith the PRC, and alternative use cases for renewably generated electricity in the South Gobi \nregion. The TA will also support the promotion of Mongolia\u2019s renewable-generated power in a \nregional  power  grid  through  continued  multilateral  dialogue,  including  the  North-East  Asia \nRegional  Power  Interconnection  and  Cooperation  Forum,  organized  by  the  United  Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Collectively, these efforts will advance \nthe concept of a renewably powered NAPSI and increase investment readiness. \n \n9.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The TA is aligned with several operational priorities of \nStrategy 2030: (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  (ii)  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity;  and \n(iii) fostering regional cooperation and integration.9 The TA also contributes directly to Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy \nfor all; SDG 9 on building resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable industrialization, and \nfostering innovation; and SDG 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its \nimpacts. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: energy-efficient and environment-friendly \ntechnology advanced.10 The TA will have the following outcome: Investment readiness of South \nGobi renewable energy development for export increased.11 Through the TA, the government will \npromote clean power exports from Mongolia as an essential part of an integrated power system \nspanning Northeast Asian countries. The TA will refine the approach to building solar and wind \ncapacity in the South Gobi region and further evaluate its relevance for the NAPSI initiative, \nincluding the value to neighboring countries. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: South Gobi renewable energy development and export plan developed. \nThis output will include three main components: \n(i)  Feasibility study of 5 GW of solar and wind power generating capacity development \nin  Mongolia\u2019s  South Gobi  region.

This study will develop a conceptual technical design \nfor  a  transmission  interconnection  that  considers  voltage  and  synchronization; \npreferred landing points, including evaluation of landing points in the Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region and Shandong Province in the PRC; and the potential for some \ndomestic use of the Mongolia-generated renewable power. The study will also \nconduct a financial analysis of the cost of exported power to the ROK relative to the \ncost of electricity in various potential export locations in the PRC. The study will \nanalyze the economic value of the preferred interconnection design and potential \ncommercial structuring arrangements for developing and operating cross-border \nassets. \n(iii)  Analysis of potential alternatives for renewable power production in the South Gobi \nregion, including green hydrogen. This study will consider the potential products and \nmarkets but also the constraints, such as water availability and proximity of carbon \nsources for synthetic hydrocarbon production. This will be a high-level analysis to \nestablish whether such potential should be investigated in more depth as Mongolia \nseeks to diversify its export base. \n \n12.  Output 2: Awareness of the potential scope and benefits of NAPSI using Mongolian \nrenewable  power  increased.  In  designing  and  executing  the  analytical  approach  for  the \ncomponents of output 1, ADB staff and consultants will engage with stakeholders from all relevant \nNAPSI countries (Japan, PRC, the ROK, and the Russian Federation) through North-East Asia \nRegional Power Interconnection and Cooperation Forum meetings and TA workshops, with \ntargeted participation of women of 25% or more.12 Ensuring that stakeholders agree on the \napproach and are well informed about the outcome of the analyses will contribute to a shared \nunderstanding of the value of renewable contributions from Mongolia in the development of \nNAPSI, which supports the region\u2019s GHG mitigation and air quality goals. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $895,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Energy Fund13 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and \n(ii) $350,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund, both to be administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.
