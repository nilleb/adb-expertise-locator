INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Fiscal Policy Reform and \nManagement. Following a reconnaissance mission in March 2013 and a fact-finding mission in \nJune 2013, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, \nimplementation  arrangement,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 sets out the next phase of fiscal policy and \nmanagement reform in the PRC.1 Fiscal policy is to be  better coordinated with monetary, \ninvestment, industrial, and land policy. An improved public fiscal system is to help gradually \nnarrow  the  gap  in  living  standards  between  urban  and  rural  areas  and  between  regions. \nOpportunity  is  to  be  distributed  more  equitably  by  revising  the  structure  of  government \nexpenditure, notably by raising the proportion allocated to public services and social security. \nThe plan also provides for the alignment of the financial resources of governments with their \nrespective authorities and improvements to financial administration. \n \n3.  The importance of fiscal policy and management was reinforced by the 18th National \nCongress of the Communist Party, held in November 2012. The congress called for accelerating \nthe reform of fiscal and taxation systems and ensuring that the central and local governments \nhave sufficient financial resources to exercise their authority and fulfill their responsibilities. \nPublic  finance  system  improvements  are  intended  to  ensure  equal  access  to  basic  public \nservices, while improvements in the taxation system structure will promote social fairness. \n \n4.  Improvements to fiscal policy and management are linked to a planned deepening of \ngovernment administrative system reforms that will result in a well-structured, accountable, and \nefficient  service-oriented  government,  streamlined  administration,  and  an  increase  in  the \ndelegation  of  authority  to  lower  levels  of  government.  Government  administration  is  to  be \ninnovative, with the goal of increasing public trust, improving competence, and making the \ngovernment more performance oriented. Mechanisms for conducting checks and oversight over \nthe exercise of authority are to be improved as well. \n \n5.  A wide range of fiscal policy and management initiatives will be needed to implement \nthese reforms. These will need to extend to township and village-level governments if rural \nincomes and agricultural productivity are to be raised and the provision of basic services is to be \nimproved in rural areas. Town districts serve as bridges between urban and rural areas. They \nprovide primary distribution centers for agricultural products from the villages, and their facilities \n(e.g., schools, hospitals) serve the population in the town and surrounding areas. Villages are \nthe fundamental organizational units for the rural population, and are administratively embedded \nin the higher township level.2  \n \n6.  Local  budgets  are  incremental  and  segmented  and  prepared  using  out-dated \nprocedures. They are yet to provide a good overview of all aspects of government operations, or \nprovide an adequate means of exercising effective control and oversight (particularly of wages \n                                                 \n1  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2010.

Washington D.C. \n ", "2  \nand salaries and out-sourced activities).3 Achievement of the government\u2019s goal of ensuring \nequal access to public services will require additional resources for social services, safety nets \nand infrastructure at the township and village level, and increased efficiency and effectiveness \nin service delivery. But gaps in the analysis and understanding of the fiscal operations of \ntownship and local governments hinder the provision of advice on needed reform. \n \n7.  Implementation of the reforms of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan will also be hindered by \ngaps  in  government  financial  reporting.  Substantial  funds  are  spent  outside  the  financial \nreporting system, the PRC\u2019s governments are yet to prepare a balance sheet, and there is a \nshortage of the information needed to review and enhance the performance of government \nagencies.  Improved  government  financial  reporting  will  raise  the  understanding  of  the \ndistribution  and  use  of  government  resources  as  well  as  fiscal  transparency,  thereby \nstrengthening governance. \n \n8.  The TA aligns with the commitments of the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe PRC by generating and sharing knowledge on best practice approaches to topical fiscal \nissues.4 The country partnership strategy positions ADB to continue playing a catalytic role in \nthe  PRC\u2019s  development  process  through  (i)  an  enhanced  focus  on  innovation  and  value \naddition; and (ii) a continued shift toward the generation of knowledge, sharing of best practices, \nand capacity building. ADB\u2019s TA will support the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen its policy, \nlegal, fiduciary, and regulatory frameworks and practices to improve infrastructure and public \nservices delivery and management. This is to build on ADB\u2019s substantial past engagement in \nthe provision of policy advice and capacity building support on emerging fiscal issues such as \ntax reform, intergovernmental fiscal relations, and local government financial management.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n9.  The impact will be a strengthened fiscal policy and management system. Performance \nwill be measured by at least two reform proposals prepared by the TA being presented to the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) by the end of 2017. The outcome will be an improved fiscal policy \nand management framework for balanced development with accountability. Performance will be \nmeasured by discussions during high-level dialogue events regarding the reform proposals \nprepared by the TA, and reference to these proposals in government statements or policy \ndocuments by the end of 2015. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n10.  The TA will provide three outputs that will assist with implementation of the next phase of \nfiscal policy and management initiatives identified in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. It will do so in a \nway that encourages open and well-informed debate, and effective communication of findings to \ndecision makers and other stakeholders. This will serve as a demonstration of good practice \napproaches to the provision of policy advice. \n \n11.  Output 1 will be fiscal policy and management initiatives for township and village-level \ngovernments that can reduce the rural\u2013urban imbalance. The emphasis will be on budget \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2013.

It will identify areas of responsibilities of rural township and \nvillage-level governments that are under-resourced (e.g., in terms of the local provision of \ninfrastructure, and social and agricultural support services), and estimate the extent of the \nresource-gap. Initiatives will be prepared that can strengthen budget preparation and reporting \nby township and village-level governments, and the efficiency and effectiveness in using budget \nresources. The advice will address how township and village governments can better mitigate \nthe adverse effects of economic and social pressures in rural areas.5  The advice will also factor \nin recent initiatives to improve living standards in rural areas (e.g., the rural pension pilot and \nNew Cooperative Medical System). \n \n12.  The  main  report  of  output  1  will present  policy  and  management  initiatives  for  the \ntownship and village-level that can narrow the gap in living standards between urban and rural \nareas. It will draw on four subreports that address, for rural areas, (i) the links between fiscal \npolicy and management initiatives at the township and village-level and rural development \npolicies  (e.g.,  land  and  environmental  management,  and  population  policies);  (ii)  fiscal \ngovernance mechanisms at the township and village level (e.g., the allocation of decision-\nmaking authorities, information disclosure); (iii) the performance of systems and procedures \nused by township and village-level governments to plan, fund, and deliver public services; and \n(iv) the adequacy of fiscal support by township and village-level governments for infrastructure, \nsocial services and agricultural services (e.g., agricultural extension, food safety standards, and \ndevelopment and distribution of improved seeds). The main report and subreports will each \nprovide background, identify key issues, present and analyze alternative policy responses, and \nexplain and justify the recommended response of fiscal policy and management. \n \n13.  The main report and four subreports of output 1 will draw on insights from a review of the \nliterature and data on rural development in the PRC; consultation with a selection of rural areas; \ntheoretical literature and international experience; and a review of pilot rural initiatives pursued \nto date under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan.6 In keeping with the TA aim of demonstrating good \npractice  approaches  to  policy  formulation,  the  recommended  initiatives  of  output  1  will  be \npresented within a results-based framework.7 The main report will include practical actions that \ncan be rapidly implemented to support the comprehensive rural reforms called for by the plan. \n \n14.  Output 2 of the TA will be policy and legislative initiatives to strengthen government \nfinancial  reporting.  The  initiatives  will  enhance  the  scientific  basis,  accuracy,  and \ncomprehensiveness of government financial reports. Improvements to government financial \nreporting regulations will be drafted, together with an explanatory manual and training material \nsuitable for central and lower-level government agencies. The recommended initiatives will \naddress the collection, storage, integration, and use of budget and financial information, and the \n                                                 \n5  Including those arising from: migration and demographic change; shortages of productive employment; gaps in \nsocial safety nets; the under provision of public goods, the erosion of the revenue base of rural governments; the \nhousehold registration system; environmental degradation; and uncertainty in land tenure. \n6  Close attention will be paid to the analysis provided in ADB. 2013.

Consideration \nwill be given to the alignment with internationally accepted reporting frameworks. \n \n15.  The  output  will  pay  close  attention  to  earlier  guidance  on  government  reporting \nrequirements  by  government  leaders,  the  National  People's  Congress  Budget  Working \nCommittee, and other key stakeholders. It will also build on internationally recognized trends in \ngovernment financial reporting, as practiced in Canada; France; Hong Kong, China; the United \nKingdom; and the United States. Special attention will be paid to the future need to prepare \ngovernment balance sheets or the potential adoption of an accrual-based accounting system. \n \n16.  Output 2 will produce a research report that will help the MOF and local finance bureaus \nbetter understand best practices for government financial reporting regulations, procedures, and \nsystems. In combination with the manual and training material, the report will help the MOF and \nlocal finance bureaus understand how to analyze and use the information provided in financial \nreports. The research report will also include practical actions, developed within a results-based \nframework, which can be rapidly adopted.  \n \n17.  Output 3 will be targeted, widely accessible knowledge products, such as short policy \nnotes or report chapters. This will raise awareness of the TA and assist in adoption of its \nsuggestions.  A  public  policy  specialist  (national  consultant)  will  be  employed  to  produce \nknowledge products containing key observations and suggestions from the TA, which will be \ndisseminated to decision makers. \n \n18.  The TA will draw on earlier TA and knowledge products supported by ADB (e.g., ADB\u2019s \nObservations and Suggestions series),8 and coordinate with ongoing TA undertaken by ADB \nand other development partners. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s earlier support for fiscal issues has highlighted the importance of focusing on \ntopical issues to ensure the relevance of ADB\u2019s support, and the timely production of widely \naccessible knowledge products that can influence decision making. The TA will respond to \nthese lessons by focusing on a small number of priority areas for the government, and providing \nfor the production and dissemination of action-oriented road maps and knowledge products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $620,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and \nother services to consultants; and will assist in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n21.  The International Department of MOF will be the executing agency. The Office of the \nWorking Party for Rural Comprehensive Reform of the State Council, which is located within \nMOF  and  is  designing  the  next  round  of  urban\u2013rural  integration  reforms,  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for output 1. MOF\u2019s Treasury Department will be the implementing agency \nfor outputs 2 and 3. The TA will commence on 1 October 2013 and be completed on 30 \nNovember 2015. \n                                                 \n8  ADB.

The TA will engage two international consultants for a total of 3 person-months, and \nseven national consultants for a total of 50 person-months. No single firm can be expected to \nprovide well-qualified consultants for the full range of diverse skills required for the TA, and \ntherefore more than one firm will be engaged. Separate consulting firms will be engaged for \noutputs 1 and 2. Output 3 will require a national consultant for 4 person-months. Given the small \ninput, this consultant will be hired individually. The terms of reference for all consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n23.  A firm will provide the national consultants for output 1, and a separate firm will provide \nthe international and national consultants for output 2. The firms will be engaged using fixed \nbudget selection and biodata technical proposals. This recruitment method is justified as a \nprecise definition of the terms of reference for the studies is possible, and changes to the terms \nof reference are not expected during implementation. The recruitment method is also justified \nbecause the budget available for the studies is fixed in each case ($210,000 for output 1 and \n$240,000 for output 2) and cannot be exceeded, and the time and personnel inputs can be \naccurately assessed. If no suitable firm can provide the required consultants in a timely manner, \nthe consultants may be hired individually, subject to the appropriate ADB approval process.  \n \n24.  ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as any resource \npersons, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Procurement of equipment, if any, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  The TA implementing agencies will coordinate with government authorities and other \nstakeholders  and  assign  appropriate  counterpart  staff  to  assist  the  consultants.  The \nimplementing agencies will supervise the day-to-day work of the consultants and take overall \nresponsibility for training programs, seminars, workshops, and international study tours. \n \n26.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, consultants will submit an inception report, quarterly progress notes, a midterm \nreport, a draft final report, and a final report to the government and ADB. The main mechanism \nto monitor and assess the TA will be TA review missions. The knowledge products created by \nthe  TA  will  be  provided  to  MOF  and  ADB  for  dissemination  to  the  government  and,  as \nappropriate, other stakeholders. There will be at least one high-quality knowledge product each \nfrom outputs 1 and 2. \n \n27.  The TA is based on the assumption that the topics addressed by the TA remain topical. \nOther key assumptions are that sufficient staff time can be made available for TA management \nby  the  implementing  agencies;  that  lower-level  governments  are  open  to  considering \nsuggestions of the TA within their areas of responsibility; and that reliable information can be \nacquired  on  a  timely  basis.  The  key  risks  are  that  complementary  reforms  cannot  be \nimplemented on a timely basis. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Fiscal Policy Reform and Management, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened fiscal  At least two reform proposals  Reports to the State  Lower-level \npolicy and  prepared under the TA on township  Council  governments are \nmanagement  and village level governments and  open to reform \nGovernment \nsystem  financial reporting are presented for  within their areas of \nannouncements and \napproval by the MOF (by the end of  responsibility \nwebsites \n2017) \nRisk \nBudget reports \nComplementary \nConsultation with  reforms are \ngovernment  required but cannot \nagencies  be implemented on \na timely basis  \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved fiscal  At least two reform proposals  Government  Policy issues \npolicy and  prepared under the TA on township  announcements and  addressed by the \nmanagement  and village level governments and  websites  TA remain topical \nframework for  financial reporting are publicly \nConsultation with \nbalanced  discussed at high-level dialogue \nexecuting and \ndevelopment with  events (by the end of 2015) \nimplementing \naccountability \nAt least two reform proposals  agencies \nprepared under the TA on township \nand village level governments and \nfinancial reporting are referred to in \ngovernment statements or policy \ndocuments (by the end of 2015) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
