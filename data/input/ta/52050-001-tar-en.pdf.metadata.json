INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help deliver knowledge \nsolutions to Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) countries. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has identified promoting knowledge solutions for its developing member countries (DMCs) \nas a strategic priority.1 The TA will help fulfill this priority by generating, facilitating, and enabling \nknowledge solutions in CWRD countries. \n \n2.  The TA will provide demand-based and just-in-time knowledge products and services \n(KPSs) to CWRD countries and facilitate knowledge and experience exchange between CWRD \ncountries and other countries of interest.2 Further, based on needs expressed by CWRD countries, \nthe TA will support improved data for evidence-based policy making and assist selected middle-\nincome CWRD countries with innovative near-term forecasting (NTF) techniques. The TA will \ncoordinate closely with ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) \nand will draw lessons from previous ADB operations. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Need for knowledge solutions. CWRD covers a diverse range of countries in Central \nAsia, South Asia, and South Caucasus: four lower middle-income countries (Georgia, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan); four upper middle-income countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan, and Turkmenistan); low-income (Tajikistan), and a low-income and post-conflict \ncountry  (Afghanistan).3 These  DMCs  face many  common, region-wide,  and  country-specific \nconstraints on economic and social development. Almost all Central Asian and South Caucasus \ncountries face low economic diversification, dependency on natural resources or on remittances, \nweak rule of law, and rising inequality. To help address these issues, CWRD DMCs are turning \nincreasingly to ADB for knowledge solutions. \n \n4.  Focused,  relevant,  demand-driven,  and  timely  knowledge  solutions  are  critical  to \naddressing these development constraints and enhancing the quality of people\u2019s lives. Knowledge \nsupport\u2014including policy analysis, formulation, and implementation as well as capacity building \nand learning from other countries\u2019 experiences\u2014is just as important for the region\u2019s low-income \ncountries as it is for middle-income countries and is demanded by various players, including \ngovernments, public and private think tanks, and other institutions. \n \n5.  Consultations with CWRD authorities and national think tanks revealed strong interest in \nsharing knowledge and relevant experiences between CWRD countries and with successful \nreformers elsewhere, such as with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) on poverty reduction and \neconomic management. CWRD needs a suitable mechanism for sharing experiences between \nCWRD countries and with other DMCs. Such learning and sharing of experiences on broad and \ndemand-driven issues\u2014in the spirit of South-South knowledge exchange\u2014will help develop \nnation-focused knowledge solutions. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \nADB\u2019s forthcoming knowledge action plan, 2019\u20132023 calls for ADB to become a demand-responsive yet proactive \nknowledge organization and aims at promoting transfer of technologies and best practices; sharing knowledge, skills, \nand expertise; and deepening knowledge partnerships. These documents and the President\u2019s Planning Directions for \n2018 also call for a stronger collaboration culture within ADB that allows for stimulating and sharing knowledge. (ADB \n[Office of the President]. 2018. Planning Directions for 2018 and Preparation of Work Program and Budget Framework, \n2019\u20132021. Memorandum. 23 February [internal]). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2018. \n3   World Bank. Country classification by income level: 2018-2019 (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org). \n ", "2 \n6.  Need for improved data for evidence-based policy making. In the complex and dynamic \ndevelopment  landscape  of  CWRD  countries,  continuous  monitoring  of  major  social  and \nmacroeconomic trends and issues is vital for proper economic analysis and policy making aimed \nat ensuring economic growth and inclusiveness. To provide data for such evidence-based policy \nmaking, the national statistical offices (NSOs) in CWRD countries need significantly improved \ncapacity and capability.4 While most NSOs in the region have benefited from earlier support from \nother development partners, including the ADB, significant gaps and needs remain, including in \ncompiling national accounts, global and regional value chain indicators, labor market indicators \nsuch as self-employed persons, Sustainable Development Goals, and various disaggregated data. \n \n7.  In almost all CWRD countries, macroeconomic data are released with substantial delay, \nand some key indicators are not available at all.5 Moreover, low-frequency data such as annual \nnational accounts often rely on a small number of surveys and indicators and provide only a partial \npicture of the economy. In such a context, proper macroeconomic forecasting is significantly \nimpaired. Current advances in economic forecasting practices, however, allow the construction of \nreliable forecasts based on the use of higher-frequency data (e.g., monthly, weekly, or daily \nindicators) and/or the use of big data.6 NTF is increasingly employed by policy makers throughout \nthe world to analyze the current state of an economy and predict its near future direction. Several \nNSOs in CWRD\u2019s middle-income countries have started employing these techniques but require \nfurther assistance to advance their use. \n \n8.  The TA will address these issues and challenges through tailored, timely, and flexible \nsupport for the emerging knowledge needs in CWRD countries. The TA will use experiences and \nlessons from relevant ADB assistance and analyses and will collaborate closely with ERCD \nactivities.7 The TA will also coordinate closely with development partners and think tanks in each \nCWRD  country  and  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Institute  and  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) Institute activities.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: economic and social policy making in CWRD \nDMCs improved. The TA will have the following outcome: analytical capacity and capability in \nCWRD DMCs enhanced.9 \n                                                \n4  NSOs here refer to national statistical agencies and other government entities that produce official statistical data, \nsuch as central banks in relation to balance of payment or monetary statistics. \n5  In many CWRD countries, the first estimate of quarterly gross domestic product is released 45 days after the end of \nthe quarter. \n6  Big data refers to the large structured and unstructured data sets arising from people\u2019s digital transactions with \ncomputers, social media, mobile phones, satellite images, and other types of digital technology. \n7  These include the following: ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Joint Government \nof Kazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, Phase 1. Manila; \nADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Joint Government of Kazakhstan and the \nAsian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, Phase 2. Manila; ADB. 2015.

Manila: ADB. \n8  The CAREC 2030 strategy recognizes the CAREC Institute as the knowledge arm of the CAREC program to serve \nthe knowledge needs of CAREC member countries. (ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared \nand Sustainable Development. Manila). \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1. Timely and relevant knowledge solutions delivered. This output will expand \nthe delivery of demand-based and just-in-time KPSs to CWRD countries.10 The TA will expand \nassistance  to  support  relevant  requests  from  public  and  private  think  tanks  and  analytical \ninstitutions in CWRD countries, in addition to government requests. It will also support in-country \ndiscussions on priority economic policy issues among policy makers, think tanks, the private sector, \nand development partners.11 \n \n11.  In addition, in response to frequent requests from authorities and analytical institutions in \nCWRD countries, the TA will help develop a suitable mechanism for sharing knowledge and \nexperiences between CWRD countries and with other DMCs.12 It will draw on lessons and \nexperiences from the CAREC Program\u2019s knowledge sharing, the ADB\u2013PRC Regional Knowledge \nSharing Initiative, and other similar mechanisms.13  \n \n12.  Output 2. Data for evidence-based policy making improved. This output will provide \ntailored support to NSOs in CWRD countries, based on the identified needs and gaps for evidence-\nbased policy making and modernizing national statistical systems. Preliminary identification of \ncountry needs in the system of national accounts (SNA)\u2014the fundamentals of official statistics\u2014\ndemonstrated that most SNA statistics in CWRD countries do not conform with the 2008 SNA \nstandards.14 Principal users of official data such as other government agencies, think tanks, \ninvestment banks, donor partners, and academics often complain of the generally low quality and \nreliability of official data, as well as inadequate access to the data.15 In addition to the overall need \nto further implement the 2008 SNA recommendations, the specific challenges identified in various \nCWRD countries included constructing and improving the constant price Supply and Use Tables \nand Input\u2013Output Tables, the capital formation segment of the SNA, and bilateral trade matrixes \nwithin the SNA. \n \n13.  The TA will coordinate closely with and complement assistance to NSOs under the TA for \nData for Development.16 Although the ongoing work primarily focuses on the SNA, the TA may \nconsider other areas of support in line with identified country-specific needs, including labor \nstatistics, especially on self-employed persons; indicators for regional and global value chains; \nimprovements in administrative data and their integration into the SNA; or indicators relevant to \n                                                \n10 Several demand-based KPSs were supported under a regional TA project (ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for \nStrengthening Knowledge Management in Central and West Asia. Manila). They included support for studies, \nconferences, capacity development, and purchase of software in CWRD countries, ranging between $3,000 and \n$98,000 for each KPS. These KPSs were well received by the governments and other stakeholders, which expressed \nthe need to continue such assistance and expand their scope. \n11 Examples include requests to support brainstorming events in Kazakhstan under the Astana Economic Club or the \nestablishment of a similar network in Uzbekistan. \n12 Topics raised during consultations included lessons on pitfalls of economic reforms from the earlier liberalizers in \nCentral Asia and South Caucasus for Uzbekistan, which recently embarked on significant economic reforms; the \nexperiences of Armenia, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union; the \nexperiences of resource-rich economies such as Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan in economic diversification; and lessons \nfor CWRD countries from the PRC\u2019s successful experience in poverty reduction. \n13 ADB\u2013PRC Regional Knowledge Sharing Initiative. \n14 United Nations Statistics Division. System of National Accounts 2008. The 2008 SNA is the latest version of the \ninternational statistical standard for the national accounts, adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission. \n15 Preliminary identification of the needs and gaps took place for several countries jointly with ERCD during the Inception \nForum and Training on the 2008 SNA under the TA for Data for Development for CAREC countries (ADB. 2017. \nTechnical Assistance for Data for Development. Manila). The TA will undertake separately an assessment of needs \nand gaps for Afghanistan, Armenia, and Turkmenistan, which were not present at the Inception Forum. \n16 ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance for Data for Development. Manila. \n ", "4 \nADB operations.17 For each country, the TA will prioritize areas of assistance based on the impact \non evidence-based policy making, synergies and efficiency from collaboration with the TA for Data \nfor Development, and ADB\u2019s comparative advantages and coordination with other development \npartners.  This  output  will  strengthen  the  analytical  capacity,  methodologies,  and  data \ndissemination of NSOs. Regional activities will be undertaken as appropriate where feasible. \n \n14.  Output 3. Near-term forecasting techniques improved in selected middle-income \nCentral and West Asia Department countries. Innovative NTF or nowcasting techniques are \nuseful because they allow for more timely forecasts of macroeconomic indicators, which are \ntypically released with substantial lags, by using higher-frequency data to predict more recent but \nso far unobserved values.18 Several NSOs in CWRD countries, such as the central banks of \nArmenia and Kazakhstan, have started using these advanced techniques, but informed ADB that \nthey require further assistance to improve their model formulation, specification, and use of data. \nThe TA will explore innovative use of big data for evidence-based policy making and collaborate \nclosely with ERCD work on nowcasting techniques.19 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. CWRD's Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision (CWRC) will implement the TA, working closely with CWRD resident missions and ERCD. \nFor output 1, KPS requests will be routed through the resident missions to CWRC and will be \nconsidered  following  established  procedure.20 CWRC  will  evaluate  requests  based  on  their \nexpected contribution to filling knowledge gaps identified in DMC country knowledge plans, and \nrank requests based on funding availability and the comparative urgency of proposals. Resident \nmissions will implement all aspects of the approved KPSs, including recruitment and supervision \nof consultants, procurement, and TA funds disbursement. Outputs 2 and 3 will be implemented by \nCWRC,  which  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants;  organize  workshops  and \nconferences; and monitor overall TA implementation. \n \n17.  Consulting services. The TA will be implemented from January 2019 to December 2020. \nADB will engage about 22 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national \nconsulting services during the TA implementation period. International consultants will include \nstatisticians, experts in the 2008 SNA and other relevant areas, data scientists or experts, and \nnowcasting experts. National consultants will include economists, statisticians, and data analysts. \nADB may also engage international and national resource persons to provide inputs, review \nreports, and participate as presenters, facilitators, and/or discussants in meetings and workshops. \n                                                \n17 One emerging area is related to the identification and profiling of subgroups of the population in CWRD countries that \nare increasingly left out in terms of benefits from economic growth. \n18 Nowcasting uses various indicators to provide concurrent updates on gross domestic product growth; it uses \nsubstantial volumes of data directly and indirectly related to economic activity. Nowcasting often uses factor models, \nwhich are based on the notion that the dynamics of a large set of time series data is driven by a small number of \ncommon factors; these factor models extract such common signals from the large number of observations. \n19 For  example,  under  ADB.  2013.

ADB  will  recruit  consultants  as  individuals  because  of  the  potentially  wide  range  of \nexpertise required, the specific country knowledge, and the need to closely coordinate with \nconsultants under the TA for Data for Development. ADB will engage consultants following the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.21 The TA funds will be disbursed following \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.
