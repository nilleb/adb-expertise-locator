In May 2002, the Country Programming Mission (CPM) reached agreement with the \nGovernment on providing advisory technical assistance (TA) for policy research networking,1 \nbased on consultations with the Government, concerned policy research institutions, and other \nexperts in the fact-finding exercise conducted during the CPM. The goals, outputs, activities, \nimplementing arrangements, and financing arrangements are detailed in this paper. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  India\u2019s Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) is being finalized. The Government\u2019s main \nstrategic goal is to reduce poverty through approaches similar to those supported by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB): sustainable growth, social development, and good governance. India \nmade impressive strides in reducing poverty during the past decade, mainly on account of rapid \ngrowth.3  However, sustainability of such growth-led poverty reduction is now in doubt because \nof two major challenges: structural distortions, especially fiscal imbalances, which can impede \nmacroeconomic  stability,  and  poor  infrastructure.  Similarly,  despite  significant  recent \nimprovements, India\u2019s human development index rank is 124 out of 173. Some core structural \ndistortions and capacity constraints urgently need to be addressed, but a mobilized civil-society \nconstituency to support economic reforms is lacking. Experts and policy advisors appreciate the \nmajor structural distortions and required reforms, but a constituency to support policymakers in \nimplementing  reforms  is  also  missing.  Such  a  constituency  is  essential  to  sustain  and \nconsolidate  the  reform  process  since  economic  reforms  in  India,  as  elsewhere,  inevitably \ninvolve the competing interests of different stakeholders. Potential losers seek to block reforms \nand, hence, sustainable growth, social development, and poverty reduction. A vehicle enabling \nexperts, policymakers, and opinion makers to network among themselves would be useful to \nbuild and strengthen a coalition for reforms, based on sound research on key policy reform \nissues. \n \n3.  Based on ADB\u2019s operational experience in India, analysis of the economic situation, and \nconsultations with senior officials and other experts, five thematic clusters of key economic \npolicy issues have been identified:  \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic  Management  and  Government  Finances.  Macroeconomic \nmanagement and fiscal policy, especially the burgeoning public debt and the \npolitical economic problems of deficit containment, are major challenges.  \n(ii)  State  Government  Budget  Constraints  and  Social  Services.  State \ngovernments are largely responsible for providing public education and health \nservices but do not have the commensurate power to raise revenue. Preemption \nof available resources for committed expenditures such as debt servicing, wages, \nand  salaries  greatly  constrains  the  governments'  capacity  to  provide  quality \nservices, especially in education and health.  \n(iii)  Agriculture, Food Security, and Rural Development. The challenges for the \nnext phase of development in agriculture, food policy, and rural nonfarm activities \nwill directly impact on poverty since most of the poor live in rural areas.  \n \n                                                 \n1   CPM Aide Memoire (24 May 2002) and CPM Back to Office Report (7 June 2002). \n2   The TA first appeared in ADB\u2019s Business Opportunities on 23 August 2002. \n3   ADB. August 2002. Country Strategy and Program Update (2003-2005): India. Manila.  ", " 2    \n(iv)  Trade  Policy,  Industrial  Performance,  and  Private  Sector  Development. \nModern economic growth, as characterized by Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets,4 \nfeatures the leading role of the industrial sector. However, industrial performance \nhas been tardy in recent years, often due to problems of adjustment to an \nemerging new trade policy regime consistent with World Trade Organization \nrequirements.  As  the  public  sector  gradually  withdraws  from  economic \nproduction, a suitable enabling environment has to be put in place to promote \ndomestic and foreign private investment.  \n(v)  Infrastructure Development for Poverty Reduction: Priorities, Constraints, \nand Strategies. Poor infrastructure is a major barrier to high growth. The role of \ninfrastructure in poverty reduction has emerged as an important policy issue for \nthe international development community.5  \n \n4.  The country has a great deal of expertise and capacity to analyze policy distortions and \ntheir impact on economic performance. However, these intellectual resources are typically \nindividual experts scattered in many public institutions which, unfortunately, lack the resources \nto conduct sustained and focused research or to network among themselves to design policy \nreforms, develop public policy dialogue, and build a reform consensus. This is a serious gap in \npolicy networking capacity, which needs to be addressed to accelerate and consolidate the next \ngeneration of economic reforms. TA is required to establish a vehicle for such networking \namong experts, policymakers, and opinion makers to build a constituency for reforms based on \nsound policy research. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n5.  The main purpose of the TA is to provide catalytic assistance to develop policy research \nnetworking capacity to build support for and consolidate the reform process. In particular, the TA \nwill support high-level policy dialogue, as well as civil-society policy discourse and constituency \nbuilding for reform, based on sound policy research in priority areas.  \n \n6.  These goals will be reached through partnerships between ADB, senior policymakers, \npublic nonprofit research institutions of national importance, individual experts, and opinion \nmakers. Networking will be organized around five priority themes identified above.  \n \n7.  The policy research networking process is being designed to generate three outputs:  \n \n(i)  about 50\u201360 policy research papers covering the priority themes, comprising a \nconsolidated  and  easily  accessible  stock  of  analytical  knowledge  on  key \neconomic policy issues and reform requirements; \n(ii)  reform  road  maps  for  the  thematic  areas  based  on  policy  dialogue  and \nconsensus  building  among  policymakers,  by  engaging  key  policymakers, \nespecially through policy retreats, to discuss the analysis and reforms proposed \nby experts' policy research papers; and \n \n                                                 \n4   Kuznets, Simon. 1966.

", "      3\n(iii)  coalition building among stakeholders in civil society for reforms in the thematic \nareas, through focused public policy discussions in seminars and conferences for \ntargeted stakeholders in civil society, and through the media, which will play a \ncritical role.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The  TA  will  finance,  and  serve  as  the  vehicle  for,  the  policy  research  networking \nprocess, and enable it to draw on international best practice experience. For instance, RETA \n256-02: Technical Assistance for the Network of Public Administration Institutes of the Asia and \nPacific Region refers to the successful  operation of the network of institutes and schools of \npublic administration in central and eastern Europe (established with 15 member institutions in \n1994, and which now has 150 member institutions). Similarly, the South Asia Network of \nEconomic  Research  Institutes,  consisting  of  about  40\u201350  members,  has  emerged  as  an \nimportant voice in policy discussions and research at the South Asia regional level.  However, \nno such initiative is currently available for policy research networking to strengthen policy \nreforms within India. The TA will fill this gap by drawing on international networking experience. \nThe knowledge base for the policy research networking process will be provided by the large \nrepository of country-specific knowledge and expertise available in  India, which can be cost-\neffectively tapped. Such expertise and specialized knowledge is typically located in nonprofit \npublic  institutions,  recognized  as  national  centers  of  excellence  in  their  fields.  A  suitable \nmodality should be created to tap into these repositories of knowledge in developing the \nenvisaged policy networking process. The other partners in this process are policymakers, \nopinion makers, and ADB.  \n \n9.  Each partner will play a key role in policy research networking. The individual experts will \nundertake policy research and generate ideas about reform road maps. The policymakers will \ntranslate  ideas  into  actual  policies.  The  opinion  makers,  particularly  journalists,  will \ncommunicate  ideas  to  civil  society  to  build  the  constituency  that  policymakers  need  to \nimplement  reforms.  The  research  or  hub  institutions,  which  will  be  the  TA  implementing \nagencies, will organize and manage interaction between experts, policymakers, opinion makers, \nand other stakeholders in civil society to generate thematic area outputs. ADB, in consultation \nwith, Economic Division of Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, the Executing \nAgency  and  the  five  advisory  committees,  will  anchor  the  networking  process  and  also \nstrategically guide the process. \n \n10.  The TA activities include the following:  \n \n(i)  establishment of advisory committees for the five thematic priorities; \n(ii)  establishment  of  a  tier-1  network  of  hub  institutions  covering  the  thematic \npriorities (Appendix 2); \n(iii)  establishment  of  a  tier-2  network  of  thematic  clusters  of  individual  experts, \nopinion makers, and policymakers organized by the hub institutions; \n(iv)  planning and review meetings of the advisory committee to develop a policy \nresearch  program  for  each  thematic  area,  and  for  monitoring  the  program's \nimplementation; \n(v)  commissioning of policy papers by the hub institutions; \n(vi)  preparation of policy research papers; \n(vii)  holding of expert technical workshops; \n(viii)  policy retreats for consultations with policymakers on reform road maps; \n(ix)  focused policy reform seminars with opinion makers; ", " 4    \n(x)  participatory policy reform consultations with targeted stakeholder groups in civil \nsociety; and \n(xi)  evaluation of the policy research networking TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total TA cost is estimated at $875,000, including $105,000 of foreign exchange cost, \nand $770,000 equivalent of local currency cost (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide $700,000 on a grant basis from the \nADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $105,000, and $595,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Economic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, \nGovernment of India and implementing agencies will cover the equivalent of $ 175,000 for local \ncurrency costs in kind. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  Executing  Agency.  The  Economic  Division,  Department  of  Economic  Affairs, \nGovernment of India, will be the Executing Agency. \n \n13.  Implementing Agencies. The implementing agencies for each thematic area will be \nfinalized, subject to the conclusion of partnership agreement with these institutions after the TA \nis operational, from the following shortlist of institutions for specific themes, which have been \nidentified in consultation with the Government and other experts:  \n \n(i)  macroeconomic management and government finances \n(a)   Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata \n(b)  Institute of Economic Growth, New Delhi \n(c)  Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai \n(d)  National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi \n(ii)  state government budget constraints and social services \n(a)  National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi \n(b)  Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum \n(c)  Institute of Social and Economic Change, Bangalore \n(iii)  agriculture, food security, and rural development \n(a)  National Centre for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research New \nDelhi \n(b)  Centre for Economic and Social Studies, Hyderabad \n(c)  Institute of Social and Economic Change, Bangalore \n(iv)  trade policy, industrial performance, and private sector development \n(a)  Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, New \nDelhi \n(b)  Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore \n(c)  National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi \n(v)  infrastructure development for poverty reduction: priorities, constraints, \nand strategies \n(a)  National Council of Applied Economic Research, New Delhi \n(b)  Tata Energy Research Institute, New Delhi \n(c)  Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad \n \n \n ", "      5\n14.  ADB will sign partnership agreements with the final hub institutions, which will constitute \nthe tier-1 network, indicating the activities they will manage, the resources they will contribute, \nand the assistance that ADB will provide. The institutions will commission the policy research \npapers and oversee their completion, review, and revisions. The institutes will also organize \nexpert  technical  workshops,  policy  retreats,  policy  reform  seminars,  and  participatory \nstakeholder  consultations.  The  partnership  agreements  will  indicate  that  ADB's  financial \nassistance will be liquidated in accordance with ADB procedures. All documentary outputs of \nthe TA will be under the joint ownership of ADB and the partner institutions. The institutions will \ncoordinate with ADB and the Economic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Government \nof India, under the relevant advisory committee.  \n \n15.  Advisory Committees. Separate advisory committees will be established under the TA \nfor each thematic area, consisting of eminent experts. ADB will constitute the committees in \nconsultation with the Economic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, \nimplementing agencies, and expert peer groups. The committees will work with ADB and the \nEconomic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India to provide overall \nstrategic guidance for the policy research networking process. The committees, the Economic \nDivision, Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India, and ADB will jointly determine \nthe issues on which policy papers should be commissioned; identify the resource persons to \nprepare papers; and participate in the technical workshops, policy retreats, and dissemination \nprograms. The committees will also continuously monitor and evaluate TA implementation in \ncooperation with ADB and the Economic Division, Department of Economic Affairs, Government \nof India. The implementing agencies will serve as committee secretariats. A chart describing the \nrole of different entities in the policy research networking process is in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  Consulting  Services.  Since  the  advisory  committees,  the  Economic  Division, \nDepartment  of  Economic  Affairs,  Government  of  India,  ADB,  and  hub  institutions  will  be \nprimarily responsible for planning and implementing activities, consulting services will be limited \nto  4  person-months  of  international  and  50  person-months  of  domestic  consultancy.  The \nconsultants will be individuals selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  economists, \nspecializing  in  economic  reform.  The  international  consultants  will  mainly  advise  the \nimplementing agencies on international networking best practices; reviewing and commenting \non the policy papers; and preparing short papers and participating in workshops, conferences, \nand seminars as required. The international consultants will also evaluate the TA near its end. \nThe domestic consultants will mainly anchor the overall TA, help manage its implementation, \nreview documents, and prepare papers. Outline terms of reference of the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n17.  The TA will commence on 1 March 2003 and be implemented over 2 years, ending 28 \nFebruary 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Policy Research Networking to Strengthen Policy Reforms, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
