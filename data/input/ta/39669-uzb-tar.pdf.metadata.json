The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  developing  regional  infrastructure  (roads).  The  TA  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s Uzbekistan country strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u20132010,1 which was \nissued in February 2006. The Reconnaissance Mission visited Uzbekistan in August 2006, \nfollowed by the Fact-Finding Mission in October 2006. The Missions reached an understanding \nwith the Government on the objective, scope, cost estimate, financing plan, implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. This TA report was prepared on \nthe basis of the Missions\u2019 discussions with the Government; observations in the field; and a \nreview of relevant data, studies, and reports.2 The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Development Context. Uzbekistan is a historical land bridge between the east (People\u2019s \nRepublic of China) and west (Europe), as well as the north (Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and \nthe Baltic states) and south (Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf). Uzbekistan can benefit from this \nrole only if the road network is well developed and maintained. Improved road corridors, road-\nrelated facilities, and other trade and transport facilitation measures including streamlining of \nprocedures  at  borders  will  facilitate  passenger  and  cargo  movement  and  are  expected  to \nincrease domestic and regional trade.  \n \n3.  The  development  agendas  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) and Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia place a high priority on integrating \nEurasia through improved infrastructure. International road traffic has benefited greatly from the \neconomic integration of the region.  \n \n4.  Road Sector Issues. Uzbekistan\u2019s major public roads, totaling 42,530 kilometers (km), \nare  divided  into  international  (3,626  km),  national  (16,909  km),  and  regional  (local)  roads \n(21,995 km). In addition, there are about 140,000 km of urban and rural roads. Road transport \ncarried about 44% of Uzbekistan\u2019s freight and 93% of its passengers in 2005. Freight and \npassenger transport are expected to increase by 4.4% and 5.1% per annum, respectively.3  \n \n5.  Road traffic volume varies across road sections. Some major roads carry more than \n10,000 vehicles per day. Traffic volume grew about 4% per year over the period 2000\u20132005. \n \n6.  In  general,  despite  a  few  missing  links,  the  road  network  has  good  coverage  and \nsufficient capacity to accommodate the moderately growing traffic demand. Most major corridors \nare dual carriageway and the current volume capacity ratios are relatively low. Part of the \nnetwork is in poor condition and requires rehabilitation. The road quality is deteriorating because \nof a maintenance backlog. In addition, poor signposting and road markings have been observed, \nthus raising road-safety concerns.  \n \n7.  Rural and urban roads, which account for over 75% of road length, also need assured \nfinancing. Because funding for road maintenance comes out of local budgets, road quality \ndepends on the available budget of the region. Most road maintenance takes place in urban \nareas.  Because  of  the  ongoing  denationalization  of  agricultural  and  stock-raising  farms,  a \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Consultant Report (draft final report). (TA 6579-UZB). \n ", "2   \nmechanism is being developed for financing the operation and maintenance of inter-farm rural \nroads.  \n \n8.  Road Sector Institutions. Responsibilities for highway construction and maintenance \nare defined by the Law for Highways, which was passed on 3 July 1992 and is now being \nupdated. Public roads are considered state property and are maintained by the state joint stock \ncompany (SJSC) Uzavtoyul. Financing comes from the Republican Road Fund (the Road Fund), \nwhich was established under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 2003. At present, road policy \ndevelopment, planning, construction, and maintenance are coordinated by the following four \nbodies: \n \n(i)  The  Uzbekistan  Transport  and  Transport  Communication  Association \n(UTACA). This policy formulation body coordinates the activities of the transport \nsector\u2019s main stakeholders.4 \n(ii)  The Road Board. This policy formulation body focuses on the road sector and is \nchaired by the deputy prime minister. \n(iii)  The Road Fund. This government agency is responsible for road investment \nplanning, project implementation, and financial management of road construction \nand maintenance. \n(iv)  SJSC Uzavtoyul. This state joint stock company is responsible for the operation \nand maintenance of major public roads.  \n \n9.  Prior to 2003, SJSC Uzavtoyul  was responsible for almost all road-sector activities \ncovering  road  infrastructure  and  road  transport  services,  and  ranging  from  planning, \nconstruction, maintenance, financing, and supervision. The Road Fund now plays most of these \nroles, particularly investment planning and execution of projects. The Road Fund\u2019s capacity in \nplanning and execution is inadequate, and therefore requires institutional capacity enhancement \nand human resources strengthening.   \n \n10.  Government  Strategy.  A  draft  concept  for  the  Development  of  Transport  and \nCommunications in the Republic of Uzbekistan to 2015, prepared in 2005, outlines the transport \nsector  development  objectives  and  strategic  directions.  The  draft  concept  underscores  the \nimportance of international traffic and suggests upgrading and maintaining the main highways to \nmeet international standards. The draft concept also highlights the need for improving road \ntransit and trade facilitation including development of common approaches to tariff and customs \npolicy. The non-physical obstacles to passenger and freight traffic by way of roads should be \nremoved. Technical equipment at border crossings should be improved to facilitate efficient \nborder-crossing procedures. This would enhance trade between Uzbekistan and its trading \npartners. \n \n11.  The Government is preparing a transport sector strategy under ADB TA 4659-UZB: \nTransport Sector Strategy5 that will provide strategic direction and an investment plan for the \ntransport sector, including roads. The strategy further elaborates the policy direction outlined in \nthe draft concept and also takes into account the Government\u2019s comprehensive investment \nprogram under approval for improving the road network. The proposed investment plan would \naccommodate the growing traffic up to 2020 by focusing on road rehabilitation and maintenance, \nparticularly  public  roads.  Specifically,  the  investment  plan  comprises  (i)  improvement  or \n                                                 \n4  The Uzbekistan Transport and Transport Communication Association (UTACA) has not been vested with specific \npolicy derivation or implementation powers and, hence, is constrained in its capacity to realize specific objectives. \n5  ADB. 2005.

(TA 4659-UZB, approved on 3 October). \n ", "      3   \nrehabilitation of the existing major roads, (ii) new construction and major upgrading of the \nexisting major roads, and (iii) implementation of road safety measures especially on domestic \nsections of international routes.  \n \n12.  The  strategic  direction  being  finalized  under  TA  4659-UZB  focuses  on  developing \ninternational corridors that will serve all users and attract transit traffic. The priority so far has \nbeen on the development of the east-west corridor. The improving situation in Afghanistan \noffers opportunities in the medium-to-longer term for development of transit corridors between \nCentral Asia and the warm-water ports in Iran and Pakistan. \n \n13.  ADB Strategy. ADB\u2019s future role in the transport sector, as outlined in the CSP, will \nfocus on (i) developing a reliable existing infrastructure network that opens up regional and \ninternational markets; (ii) integrating transport systems for improved safety and service quality; \n(iii)  harmonizing  the  regulatory  framework  to  promote  efficiency;  (iv)  restructuring  and \nmodernizing the transport sector by promoting competition; (v) competitive marketing and tariff-\nsetting; and (vi) improving financing and management efficiency and effectiveness. The CSP \nalso notes that an effective and relatively inexpensive system of intra-regional customs transit is \nurgently needed, but that this requires concerted efforts by the Central Asian republics and \nadjacent countries. \n \n14.  ADB  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  transport  sector,  customs  cooperation,  and  trade \nfacilitation activities for CAREC, of which Uzbekistan is a member. A number of studies were \ncompleted or are being undertaken through ADB regional technical assistance.6 In the road \nsector, ADB has financed TA 3118-UZB: Road Sector Institutional Strengthening and Policy \nSupport Project7 and approved Loan 1657-UZB: Road Rehabilitation Project8 which was later \ncancelled by the Government because (i) the road section identified under this project was no \nlonger a government priority; and (ii) the Government was unable to comply with loan covenants, \nespecially road sector reforms, prior to project implementation.   \n \n15.  Road sector reform has been progressing significantly since 2003. Reform measures \ninclude (i) sector unbundling by separating road transport operation and road construction; (ii) \ninstitutional  reform  by  creating  UTACA,  the  Road  Board,  and  the  Road  Fund,  and  by \nrestructuring SJSC Uzavtoyul; and (iii) promotion of competitive bidding for road construction \nworks,  some  of  which  are  recommendations  of  TA  3118-UZB  (footnote  7).  Because  the \nsignificant  progress  in  this  sector  is  in  line  with  the  strategic  direction  of  ADB\u2019s  planned \nintervention in Uzbekistan, i.e., promoting regional cooperation, ADB considers assisting the \nGovernment to develop its road network as a strategic action.9 Other reassurances for ADB \ninclude (i) the transport sector policy objective outlined under the draft concept, (ii) the transport \nsector strategy being finalized under ADB assistance, and (iii) the solid investment pipeline \ndeveloped by the Road Fund. A programmatic approach using the ADB\u2019s multitranche financing \n                                                 \n6 For example, ADB. 2005.

The regional road between Guzar and Beyneu was proposed for the feasibility study to \nbe prepared under the TA based on the following criteria: (i) it is a government priority according \nto the Program for Road Development (2007\u20132010),10 (ii) it promotes regional cooperation with \nfocus on international trade, (iii) it is significant to Uzbekistan\u2019s economic development, and (iv) \ntraffic flow is increasing. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The TA's main impact will be improved road traffic operation on the rehabilitated regional \nroad. Road rehabilitation will reduce vehicle operating costs and travel time of the domestic, \nregional, and transit traffic, thereby contributing to the growth of domestic and international trade \nin  the  area,  promoting  regional  cooperation  with  neighboring  countries,  and  satisfying  the \nrequirements of local population in transportation of goods and passengers. The TA outcome \nwill be the agreed design and feasibility study for a regional road project suitable for ADB \nfinancing.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n18.  The TA will prepare (i) a feasibility study for the project that includes project scope and \nrationale, technical and economic appraisal, assessments of environmental and social impacts, \nand land acquisition and resettlement plan; and (ii) project implementation arrangements and \nfinancing plan for ADB assistance. A team of consultants will be recruited to carry out the tasks.  \n \n19.  The proposed project road that connects Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan is strategically \nsignificant as it is part of Asian Highway AH-63 as well as European Highway E-40. The \nregional road between Guzar and Beyneu is an existing major public road with partially poor \npavement condition. With the existing traffic of about 2,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day and \npredicted  traffic  growth  of  4%  per  year,  the  existing  road  capacity  would  be  sufficient  to \naccommodate the predicted traffic for the next 15 years. Rehabilitation of the existing road will \nnot likely involve major road widening. Therefore, no major land acquisition or issues involving \nindigenous  peoples  are  expected.  Moreover,  the  environmental  impact  of  the  project  is \nexpected to be minimal. The initial poverty and social analysis is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n20.  The key activities will include (i) development of project rationale and traffic demand \nforecast;  (ii)  assessment  of  engineering,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  aspects  for \nalternative  designs;  (iii)  preliminary  engineering  design  and  project  cost  estimation;  (iv) \nassessment of economic viability and safeguard compliance; and (v) preparation of project \nfinancing plan and implementation arrangements. Following agreement on the project and its \nmodalities  by  ADB  and  the  Government,  the  consultants  will  complete  project  preparation \ndocuments for further ADB loan processing.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  This priority is also confirmed by the transport sector strategy being finalized under ADB. 2005 Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132020) (Financed by the Japan \nSpecial Fund). Manila. (TA 4659-UZB, approved on 3 October). \n ", "      5   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $300,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the remaining \n$130,000 equivalent to cover the costs of office accommodation and counterpart staff. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of this TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. A detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over a 4-month period. It is expected to begin in May 2007 \nand to be completed in August 2007. The TA will require a total of about 21 person-months of \nconsulting services, including about 9 person-months of international consultants and about 12 \nperson-months of national consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services \nare given in Appendix 4. \n \n23.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be recruited \nusing  the  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures11 based  on  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April \n2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  international  consultants  will  include  a  team \nleader/transport economist (4 person-months), road engineer (2 person-months), environmental \nspecialist  (1.5  person-months),  and  social  development  specialist  (1.5  person-months);  the \nteam  of  national  consultants  will  comprise  a  transport  economist  (2  person-months),  road \nengineer (3 person-months), environmental specialist (3 person-months), social development \nspecialist (3 person-months), and financial management specialist (1 person-month). \n \n24.  The Road Fund will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A counterpart team led by \nthe Road Fund will be established to coordinate TA activities and work with the consultants on a \ndaily basis. A steering committee composed of the Ministry of Economic Relations, Investments, \nand Trade; MOF; UTACA; the Road Board; and the Road Fund will be established to oversee \nTA implementation. Road sector stakeholders will be invited to a workshop to discuss the \npreliminary  findings  of  the  TA.  The  Road  Fund  will  provide  the  consultants  with  office \naccommodation (suitably furnished) and communications facilities, and assign two operational \nstaff to work with the consultants as required. The Road Fund will also make available to the \nconsultants  all  relevant  reports,  studies,  engineering  designs,  statistical  data,  any  other \ninformation, and maps needed to undertake the study. If necessary, ADB will sign a special \nagreement on confidentiality of the documents and use them only for the study purposes. \nEquipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the EA upon its completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for preparing the Regional Infrastructure (Roads) Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n11  For TAs of less than $600,000, consultants are generally selected using the biodata technical proposal. However, \nbecause the Government requested ADB to select a firm that could produce a high-quality feasibility study, the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  to  ensure  that  the  selected  firm  understands  the  approach  and \nmethodology. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact  By 2010    Assumptions \n       \nImproved traffic  \u2022  Road between Guzar  \u2022  National, provincial,  \u2022  Increased availabilityand \noperation on the  and Beyneu constructed  and district  quality of transport \nrehabilitated regional  on time, within budget,  socioeconomic  services following \nroad   and meeting technical  statistics from the  improvement of the \n  specifications   Central Statistics  project road \n  \u2022  Increased traffic volume  Office   \u2022  Improved cross-border \n  as projected  \u2022  ADB\u2019s project  facilities and procedures \n \n\u2022  Reduced average travel  completion report  at border point(s) \n \ntime  and project   \n \n\u2022  Reduced fatality rate  performance  Risk \n \n  evaluation report   \n \n    \u2022  The capacity of the Road \n  Fund as the TA\u2019s \n  Executing Agency \n  remains weak despite \nefforts to strengthen it.  \n \nOutcome  By 2007    Assumption \n       \nAgreed loan project for  \u2022  Project and financing  \u2022  Minutes of the board  \u2022  Sufficient government \nimplementation  scheme for immediate  meeting  budget and resources \n  implementation  \u2022  Loan agreement   \n  formulated     \n  \u2022  Loan negotiations     \nsigned by ADB and the \nGovernment  \n \nOutputs  By 2007    Assumption \n       \nTechnical, economic,  \u2022  Feasibility study report  \u2022  Consultants\u2019  \u2022  Timely provision of \nsocial, and  completed.

The country has defined \nthe objectives and tasks in the Welfare Improvement Strategy Paper for 2005\u20132010 based on the peculiarities of \nUzbekistan, including (i) improvement of the living standards of the population and reduction of poverty by half by \n2015, in accordance with the main MDG; (ii) guarantee of equal access to basic education, which is the main priority \ndefined in the section on education; (iii) achievement of gender equality and provision of women with their rights and \nopportunities through all sections of the Strategy; (iv) improvement of the living standards of mothers and children; and \n(v) prevention of the spread of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.  \n \nThe TA's main impact will be improved road traffic operation on the rehabilitated regional road between Guzar and \nBeyneu. Road rehabilitation will reduce vehicle operating costs and travel time of the domestic, regional, and transit \ntraffic,  thereby  contributing  to  the  growth  of  domestic  and  international  trade  in  the  area,  promoting  regional \ncooperation with the neighboring countries, and satisfying the requirements of local population in transportation of \ngoods and passengers.  \n \nImproved connectivity will improve access to markets, schools, and health facilities; promote economic growth; and \ncontribute to employment creation and income generation for poor households, thus reducing the incidence of poverty \nin the project area.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA poverty and social analysis will identify the socioeconomic profile of the population in the project area, expected \nbenefits and constraints, and ability of the poor and vulnerable groups to benefit from the project. The analysis will \nidentify ways to incorporate the needs of the poor and minimize or compensate for adverse impacts on the poor. This \nwill be done through a review of existing studies on poverty and social analysis, focus group discussions and key \ninformant interviews with primary and secondary stakeholders, and an additional socioeconomic survey of the project \narea if required. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe  project  design  will  be  developed  through  primary  and  secondary  stakeholder  consultations.  The  primary \nstakeholders would include the (i) road users, (ii) people living in the project area (men and women), (iii) affected \npeople caused by land acquisition (if any), and (iv) people who are employed during road construction by the \ncontractors and during road maintenance activities after the completion of the project. The secondary stakeholders \nwould include (i) officials of the Road Fund; the State Committee on Land Resources, Geodesy, Cartography and \nState Cadastre; the Ministry of Pubic Health; and other funding agencies; and (ii) contractors working on ongoing \nprojects. Stakeholder consultations will facilitate the understanding of needs, priorities of the various stakeholders with \nregard  to  road  development,  and  capacity-building  issues.  They  will  facilitate  community  participation  in  road \nconstruction and maintenance and be a means of maximizing women\u2019s participation in the project. They will also help \nto identify the benefits and risks that are associated with different socioeconomic groups and their absorptive capacity \nin utilizing the improved road. Particular attention will be given to assessing the possible risks associated with \nHIV/AIDS and emerging infectious diseases risks and to preparing appropriate mitigation mechanisms.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?

Scope of Work  \n1.  The consultants will study the feasibility of a road rehabilitation project that would target \nthe regional road between Guzar and Beyneu. The consultants will also explore the possibility of \napplying  a  programmatic  approach  using  the  multitranche  financing  facility  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \nB.   Preparation of the Feasibility Study  \n2.  Task 1. Develop the project rationale. The consultants will discuss with the Government \nthe key issues and policies of the road sector to establish policy, priority framework, and \nrationale for the project.  \n \n3.  Task 2. Prepare traffic forecasts. The consultants will obtain the latest traffic data, latest \neconomic data, and all other relevant data and information that will allow prediction of traffic. \nDetermine the traffic forecast \u201ctimeframe\u201d by considering the pavement design life and road \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  strategy  over  the  entire  lifetime.  Explain  traffic-forecast \nassumptions and method used. Identify cross-border movement issues between Kazakhstan \nand Uzbekistan at Beyneu that could affect international traffic and recommend measures to \naddress them.    \n \n4.  Task 3. Prepare the preliminary design of the project road and associated facilities \ntogether with the phasing plan. Take into account road safety and environmental mitigation \nmeasures. \n \n5.  Task  4. Estimate capital and maintenance costs. The consultants will prepare cost \nestimates  at  current  prices  based  upon  the  preliminary  design  of  the  project  road  and \nassociated facilities. \n \n6.  Task 5. Undertake an economic and financial sustainability analysis. The consultants \nwill carry out the economic analysis by comparing \u201cbase case\u201d and \u201cproject case\u201d scenarios. \nThe base case reflects expected conditions in the absence of the project, with maintenance \nsufficient  only  to  hold  the  road  in  its  present  condition.  The  project  case  involves  initial \ninvestment followed by routine and periodic maintenance, but with expenditure and frequency of \nperiodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road conditions and traffic flows. \nDuring the study, the level of international traffic could be identified. If considered significant, a \nregional economic internal rate of return should be estimated. Financial sustainability analysis \nshould be performed for the selected road taking into account operation and maintenance costs. \n \n7.  Task  6. Prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA) or initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and its summary (SEIA or SIEE). The consultants will review the Executing \nAgency\u2019s  (EA)  capacity  to  handle  environmental  management  and  recommend  ways  to \nstrengthen it. They will also make recommendation on the implementation of the environmental \nmonitoring and management plans in the EIA or IEE report, as required. The EIA or IEE should \nconform  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002)  and  related  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003) as well as ADB's Public Communications Policy (2005) by holding public \nconsultation sessions to obtain stakeholders' opinion. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n8.  Task 7. Conduct the desk/field investigations for the poverty and social analysis (PSA) \nand prepare a PSA report that meets the requirements of The ADB Handbook on Poverty and \nSocial Analysis. The PSA will identify (i) poverty issues related to livelihood, trade, and transport \npatterns in project areas; and (ii) complementary physical/non-physical interventions that may, if \nincluded in the project, add to its poverty reduction potential. More relevant is finding out \nwhether  the  enhanced  trade  between  Kazakhstan  and  Uzbekistan  will  result  in  labor  and \nincome opportunities. Lastly, the PSA will address (i) a strategy to maximize the project impact \non women, (ii) a participation strategy in project design and implementation, (iii) core labor \nstandards, (iv) HIV/AIDS, and (v) human trafficking. \n \n9.  Task  8.  Assess  quantitatively  the  poverty  impact  of  the  project.  Define  the  project \ninfluence area as the basis for the analysis and outline the mechanisms through which the \nproject  helps  reduce  poverty.  Identify  relevant  indicators  and  formulate  a  methodology  to \nmonitor the impact of the project on poverty in the project influence area, and ensure that such \nindicators are introduced in the project\u2019s design and monitoring framework. \n \n10.  Task  9.  In  conjunction  with  the  feasibility  study,  determine  any  possible  need  for \ntemporary and permanent land acquisition and compensation/resettlement arrangements. If \nneeded, prepare a short or full resettlement plan according to the format and scope required by \nthe ADB. Resettlement documents should be prepared in accordance with ADB's Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006), the \nLand Law, the Civil Code, and relevant national laws and decrees. \n \nC.  Formulation of Financing and Implementation Arrangements \n11.  Task 10. On the basis of the feasibility studies\u2019 cost estimates, help finalize the financing \nplan of the project. Assess the EA\u2019s and the likely implementing agency\u2019s financial management \ncapacity, design the funds flow for the project, and propose the appropriate disbursement \narrangements. \n \n12.  Task 11. Prepare a detailed implementation schedule and procurement plan for the \nproject.  Prepare  the  project  disbursement  schedule  and  identify  critical  project  preparation \nactivities.  Propose  an  organizational  scheme  for  project  implementation  (including \npreconstruction activities). \n \n13.  Task  12.  Recommend ways to strengthen the coordination, monitoring, and project \nimplementation  capacity  of  the  EA.  Draft  terms  of  reference  for  project  coordination  and \nimplementation consulting services for the project. With government agreement, develop action \nplans to mitigate corruption during project implementation. \n \n14.  Task  13.
