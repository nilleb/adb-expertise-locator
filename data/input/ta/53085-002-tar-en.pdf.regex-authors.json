THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) upcoming Strengthening Urban Health Services \nProject will improve quality and coverage of health services in Solomon Islands, with particular \nfocus on Honiara. The following output areas are expected to be delivered under the project: (i) \nquality of services provided by NRH strengthened; (ii) primary and secondary healthcare provision \nin Honiara upgraded; and (iii) urban healthcare delivery systems improved. The total indicative \ncost for the project is $11.0 million, of which ADB is expected to finance (i) a concessional loan \nof $5.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $5.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund). The government will provide \nsupport through exemption of taxes and duties and funding towards project costs (including \nthrough allocation of staffing for upgraded and/or new health centers), estimated at $1.0 million. \nThere is no immediate co-financing partner, but discussions with bilateral partners are ongoing.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) of $750,000, to be implemented over a 21-\nmonth period (January 2020\u2013September 2021), will provide technical analysis and assessments \nto assist the government and the ADB to develop the proposed Strengthening Urban Health \nServices Project. The TRTA is justified given the scope of activities and specialist nature of skills \nrequired. Due diligence will be undertaken based on the proposed project design. The TRTA will \nalso build the capacity of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) to administer the \nensuing project, and enhance project readiness for timely implementation given ADB\u2019s relatively \nnew engagement with MHMS. The TRTA is included in the ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan for Solomon Islands, and the ensuing project is in the 2021 pipeline.1 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  Output 1: Project scoping and design completed. This output will scope out the project \ndesign and activities to be undertaken throughout the investment project. It will identify specific \nmeasures to strengthen the functionality of the NRH, ascertain the most viable health centers to \nbe upgraded and/or new sites to be constructed, and specify health systems components that \nrequire to be implemented in order to improve project outcomes (such as integrated referral \npathways and workforce planning policies and guidelines). There will be careful consideration \ngiven to existing ADB policies including safeguards, procurement, and financial management.  \nThe scoping exercise will also determine the most effective sequencing of outputs and strategic \nalignment  and collaboration  with  ongoing  programs of  other development  partners, private \ninstitutions, and government within the context of the overall sector reform. The project design \nwill also incorporate lessons learned and best practices from similar projects elsewhere in the \nPacific, other ongoing projects in Solomon Islands, and identify the implementation modality that \nwill best deliver the project outputs in accordance to the capacity of the implementing agency and \nconcerned government offices involved. \n \n4.  Output 2: Project due diligence undertaken. The TRTA will support all required due \ndiligence  to feed  into  and help  refine  the project design.  It  is expected to be  undertaken \nconcurrently with finalization of the scope as some findings and mitigation recommendations \nmight lead to adjustments in the design with financial and cost implications. Due diligence includes \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2019. 11 Small Pacific Island Countries 2020\u20132022. Country Operations Business Plan.

Output 3: Support to project readiness and project management capacity of the \nimplementing agency. This output will support project preparation and readiness by providing \nan advisory  role  in finalizing  the design of  the project, implementation  arrangements, and \nassessing risks and mitigation measures, in coordination with key government and other relevant \nstakeholders. This output also includes assisting the government during project start-up, such as \npreparation  for  the  recruitment of  a project management unit,  preparing  any  draft  bidding \ndocuments required, and providing coordination support with key government agencies and other \nrelevant stakeholders as necessary. The capacity of the executing and implementing agencies \nfor project preparation and implementation will also be strengthened and mechanisms to enhance \nthe existing management information system will be assessed. Key activities include (i) assessing \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  identifying  gaps  with  regards  to  project  preparation  and \nimplementation; and (ii) organize training, capacity building exercises and activities to address \nidentified gaps and areas requiring improved capacity. \n \n6.

ADB is providing support to the Solomon Islands government to develop a comprehensive \ncosted business case for the phased relocation of the NRH under separate regional technical \nassistance.2 The business case is expected to be completed in February 2020. Findings of the \nbusiness case will inform project due diligence on economic and financial analyses, procurement, \nfinancial management capacity assessment, and environmental impact assessment. Proposed \nwork under this TRTA take into account findings of the business case in developing specific \noutputs of the project.3  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $770,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide in-kind \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space, data, information, and other contributions \nestimated at $20,000. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TRTA. The Pacific Department\u2019s Social Sectors and Public Sector \nManagement  Division  will  select,  administer,  evaluate,  and  supervise  the  consultants,  in \ncoordination with  MHMS.  The existing Senior Executive Management  Committee under the \nMHMS, consisting of the Minister, Permanent Secretary, and Under Secretaries for MHMS, will \nprovide oversight for the project preparation including the technical aspects of the design. A \nproject steering committee will be established as outlined in the concept paper, and will provide \nguidance once it is established. The project steering committee is envisaged to continue its \nsupport  during  the  implementation  of  the  project.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2020\u2013September  2021  \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury \nImplementing agency  Ministry of Health and Medical Services \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: quality  Consulting firm for  $630,000 \n  and cost- project design, due \n  based  diligence and \n  selection  project readiness \n  and capacity \nbuilding support \nIndividual:  National experts  $75,000 \nindividual  Health Advisor (3 person-months), \nconsultant  Project Management \nselection  Coordinator/Procurement \nSpecialist (2 person-months), and \nEnvironmental  Safeguard Specialist \n(3 person-months) \nDisbursement  The  TA  resources  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2018.
