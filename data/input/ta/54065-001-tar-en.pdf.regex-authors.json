INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will develop policies and capacity, \ntechnical guidance, and design of pilots to combine and advance the concepts of zero waste cities \nand green circular economy cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 The TA will support \nthe development of policies, institutional and technical solutions, business models, and private \nsector solutions to help the PRC become a leader in green circular economy zero waste cities, \nmoving to full life-cycle concepts and internalization of external environmental and social costs. \nThe  project\u2019s  four  outputs  will  broadly  cover  (i)  advanced  upstream  circular  production;  \n(ii) downstream improved waste management and resource recovery; (iii) midstream improved \npackaging  and  logistics,  addressing  growing  waste  from  e-commerce;  and  (iv)  building \ninstitutional capacity and linking the upstream, midstream, and downstream processes into a \ncircular system of biological and technical cycles. Linking and integrating the comprehensive \napproach of green circular economy cities which requires systemic transformation and takes more \ntime to fully implement, with the zero waste cities approach, that is a practice of resource recovery \nfrom waste aiming at near full reuse and recycling, will be a practical avenue to achieve more \nresource efficiency in a shorter period of time. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the list of projects agreed between the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the PRC Government on 22 January 2020. The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020;2 and the following Operational Priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 (i) Priority 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) Priority 2: \naccelerating progress in gender equality; (iii) Priority 3: tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) Priority 4: making \ncities more livable.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The increasing amount of natural resources demand and consumption in the current linear \neconomic model of \"take\u2013make\u2013waste,\" along with continued urban and economic growth and \nthe  association  of  unsustainable  consumption  behavior  with  increased  well-being  are  key \nchallenges to sustainable, low-carbon, and climate-resilient development in the PRC and around \nthe world. In the current linear system, upstream production is inefficient and wasteful, midstream \npackaging and logistics management is inadequate and uses a lot of single-use plastics, and \ndownstream solid waste management is still weak especially regarding product reuse and \nresource recovery rates. Existing production chains, consumption levels, and disposal practices \ninevitably lead to ecosystem depletion, waste, and environmental pollution. A holistic strategy of \na green circular economy creating product life cycles that account for environmental, economic, \n \n1  In a circular economy, the value of products and materials is maintained for as long as possible. Waste and resource \nuse are minimized. When a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value. This can bring \nmajor economic benefits, contributing to innovation, growth, and job creation. European Commission. 2015. Circular \nEconomy Package: Questions & Answers.

Products and processes need to internalize external costs,4 \noptimize natural resource use efficiency, and eventually promote the idea that nothing should be \nconsidered \u201cwaste\u201d.5 \n \n4.  The PRC faces serious challenges related to high levels of resource use and rapidly \nincreasing generation of solid waste, including packaging and logistics waste. Research from \n2016 suggests that the PRC requires 2.5 kilograms of materials to generate $1.0 of gross \ndomestic product, compared with 0.5 kilograms in Organisation of Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment countries.6 The World Bank forecast in 2012 that urban solid waste generation in \nthe PRC would reach 510.0 million metric tons per year by 2025 up from 190.0 million tons in \n2012.7 In 2018, the PRC decided to stop importing waste from other countries for processing. The \nrise of packaging waste from e-commerce has contributed to an overall increase in municipal solid \nwaste in the PRC.8 This coincides with a growing urban population and economic growth \nassociated with an increase in demand for products and resources, even as natural resources \nbecome more scarce. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, e-commerce and \nmedical single-use plastics increased significantly compared with the same period in 2019.9 \n \n5.  The TA will build on PRC efforts to conceptualize, pilot, and promote circular economy \nlaws and regulations such as the Circular Economy Promotion Law of the PRC (2008) and the \nNational Action Plan for Circular Economy Development adopted in 2017\u2014including ambitious \ntargets for resource recovery and circular industrial parks.10 The TA will also build on programs \nin the PRC to reduce, reuse, and recycle (the \u201d3R\u201d principle) household waste and improve \nconstruction and demolition waste management. In addition, the TA will build on the National Zero \nWaste Cities pilot program under the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. There are many \nexamples in the PRC of circular practices in agriculture and of water utilities reusing treated \nwastewater and wastewater treatment plants practicing effective sludge management.11 The TA \nwill incorporate international best practices including the Circular Economy Action Plan of the \nEuropean Union, who also engages in a formal cooperation with the PRC on the topic.12  \n \n6.  The TA will build on lessons from previous and ongoing ADB loan and TA projects, \nincluding (i) Promoting Action on Plastic Pollution from Source to Sea in Asia and the Pacific;  \n(ii) Study on Municipal Solid Waste Regional Integrated Management Model for Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei; (iii) Construction and Demolition Waste Management and Recycling; (iv) Hunan Xiangjiang \nRiver Watershed Existing Solid Waste Comprehensive Treatment Project; (v) Agriculture Green \n \n4  External costs, also known as externalities, are defined as uncompensated social or environmental effects. For \nexample, when people buy fuel for a car, they pay for the production of that fuel, which is an internal cost, but not for \nthe costs of burning that fuel, such as air pollution. \n5  S.

The TA will conceptually and programmatically link into biological and technical cycles the \nthree aspects of the current linear upstream, midstream, and downstream processes. Firstly, \nQinghai Province will be a case targeting upstream heavy industrial production with raw material \nprocessing.  Secondly,  Guangdong  Province  will  be  a  case  targeting  downstream  waste \nmanagement and resource recovery in highly developed urban centers with state of the art light \nindustry manufacturing and services, and less-developed rural towns displaying differentiated \nlevels and patterns of consumption and waste generation. Thirdly, pilot cities around the country \nof different sizes and development levels will be working together with relevant industry partners \nto address the midstream e-commerce packaging and logistics challenges, which represent a key \nlink in the circular economy. Lastly, all three will be linked and lessons drawn for policies, technical \nguidance, and business models aiming at green circular economy zero waste cities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  green  development  and  ecological \ncivilization14 in the PRC achieved.15 The TA will have the following outcome: green circular \neconomy zero waste cities in the PRC enabled.16  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Green circular industrial production plan of Qinghai Province advanced. \nThis output will help Qinghai Province develop its circular economy by advancing a plan for green, \nlow-carbon circular economy development in industrial parks, focusing on heavy industry and \nmining processing.17 Under this output, the TA team will research challenges, opportunities, and \nmarket failures and design advanced technical guidelines, policies, and pilots. Concepts to be \nconsidered  will  include  life  cycles  of  products  and  materials;  natural  resource  use;  linking \nindustrial processes, energy efficiency, and renewable energy production and consumption; and \nmissing upstream and downstream relationships. This output will include research on solutions to \nreduce pollutant emission and discharge; creation of new jobs, including jobs for the poor and for \nwomen; and local value addition. The output will also include components to raise awareness and \npromote behavioral change.  \n \n \n13 ADB.

Output 2: Zero municipal waste action plan for Guangdong Province developed. \nThis output will focus on designing and prioritizing actions to significantly reducing household \nwaste in Guangdong Province, with a goal of nearly full recovery of household waste. This output \nwill  include  research  on  and  policy  design  for  household  waste  classification  and \nrecommendations to efficiently manage segregation and recycling technologies in both highly \ndeveloped urban centers and lesser developed towns and villages. The 3R principle will be \napplied in capacity development and in the action plan, and pilots will be designed to improve \nwaste management and resource recovery. City governments, communities, households, and \nlocal businesses will be engaged through public awareness raising initiatives and government \nincentives will be proposed to encourage industry and people to do the \"right things\" (e.g., \ndesigning green products aimed at reducing or eliminating waste). The output will also propose \noptions for government-imposed disincentives\u2014such as charges, taxes, and levies\u2014for doing \nthe \"wrong things\" (e.g., continuing to produce waste and use up natural resources). \n \n11.  Output 3: Green circular e-commerce packaging and logistics pilot program for the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China developed. This output will focus on the important emerging \nchallenge of reducing plastic pollution caused by significantly increasing e-commerce and food \ndelivery, and associated packaging and logistics. It will support the development of a national pilot \nprogram customized for cities of various types, sizes, and development levels, engaging market \nplayers in e-commerce and logistics. It will explore new forms of recyclable and/or reusable \npackaging, logistics, and distribution equipment and facilities with the goal of creating a green \nsupply chain in which single-use plastics are eliminated. Options for market-based instruments \nand business models will be explored and included in the design for the pilot program. \n \n12.  Output 4: Capacity and institutions to implement green circular economy in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China enhanced. This output will develop the capacity of and provide \npolicy and technical guidance for cities, institutions, and companies to promote and implement \ngreen circular economy zero waste cities. The TA expert team will link into biological and technical \ncycles improved upstream, midstream, and downstream processes, integrating the findings and \nrecommendations from outputs 1, 2, and 3, offering policy recommendations and technical and \nbusiness model options. It will include components to raise public awareness on resource scarcity \nand environmental challenges of solid waste, and raise the sense of producer and consumer \nresponsibility promoting a circular economy and the need for reducing waste. Cases with lessons \nfrom previous projects in the PRC and other countries will be prepared and incorporated. \nCollaboration with the ADB TA project Promoting Action on Plastic Pollution from Source to Sea \nin Asia and the Pacific (footnote 13) is planned through mutual participation in training events.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $735,000, of which $667,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.
