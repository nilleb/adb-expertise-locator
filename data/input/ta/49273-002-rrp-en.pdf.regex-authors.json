THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project. \n \n2.  Financial inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka remains \na  key  development  priority  for  the  government  given  SMEs\u2019  large  demand  for  credit,  the \nfinancial barriers facing SMEs, and SMEs\u2019 potential for reducing unemployment and regional \ninequalities. This additional financing will provide loans to Sri Lankan banks to encourage them \nto grow their SME portfolios, and will extend the current successful project, which otherwise \nwould close ahead of schedule, through March 2020. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Small and medium-sized enterprise exclusion. A vibrant SME sector has the potential \nto mitigate several of Sri Lanka\u2019s most difficult development challenges.1 SMEs have higher \ngrowth potential, can create jobs, and, over time, increase the tax base at a quicker pace than \nlarger enterprises. They can also reduce regional inequalities. While all firms in Standard & \nPoor's Sri Lanka 20, the main national stock market index, are headquartered in Colombo, \nSMEs are spread throughout the country. For women, whose participation in the Sri Lankan \nworkforce lags that of international peers, and for youths, whose unemployment rate exceeds \nthe national average, start-up businesses offer an opportunity to participate meaningfully in the \neconomy. A more vibrant SME sector could also increase exports and attract foreign direct \ninvestment. \n \n4.  Access to finance is the main challenge for SMEs. The World Bank\u2019s Enterprise Survey \nfound that 30% of Sri Lankan firms identified it as a major constraint, a percentage surpassed \nonly by Mongolia, Nepal, and Afghanistan among the developing member economies of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). Only in Tonga are firms more reliant on internal funding for \nnew investments, and just 25% of Sri Lankan firms said that they did not need a loan, the lowest \namong ADB developing members.2 High financial barriers are even more imposing for often-\nexcluded segments such as SMEs that have not borrowed previously from a bank, are led by \nwomen, or are located outside of Colombo. \n \n5.  Recognizing these difficulties, the government has prioritized SMEs\u2019 financial inclusion. \nThis involves business development services, initiatives to promote venture capital funding, and \nprograms such as the ADB credit line to encourage banks to target the SME segment. SME \nfinancing has been identified and enhanced as a priority in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka3 and is being supported by other development partners.4 \n \n                                                \n1  The  project  uses  the  Sri  Lankan  government\u2019s  definition  of  SMEs,  which  is  annual  turnover  of  less  than \nSLRs750 million, fewer than 300 employees if a manufacturer, or fewer than 200 employees if in the service \nsector. The definition effectively includes microenterprises. \n2  World Bank. Enterprise Surveys. http:// http://www.enterprisesurveys.org/data (accessed August 2017). \n3  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n4  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n6.  Banking environment. The government\u2019s focus on SMEs\u2019 financial inclusion remains \nrelevant given developments in the Sri Lankan banking during 2016\u20132017. The Central Bank of \nSri  Lanka  has  raised  interest  rates  three  times  since  February  2016.  Tighter  monetary \nconditions have reduced private sector credit growth, which decreased from 6.2% in January\u2013\nMay 2016 to 4.5% in January\u2013May 2017. In a restrictive environment, initiatives to promote \nfinancial inclusion of SMEs have more significance because banks may be inclined to focus on \nestablished client bases. \n \n7.  Original  project.  ADB  approved  in  2016  an  SME  credit  line  that  is  on  track  for \ncompletion.5 The original project used incentives and penalties to promote financial inclusion. \nLike other SME projects, it set requirements for onlending to underrepresented segments such \nas women-led SMEs and SMEs that had previously not borrowed from a bank. In contrast to \nother  credit  lines,  banks  choose  their  own  disbursement  targets  but  incur  sharp  financial \npenalties  for  not  achieving  the  targets  within  3  months.6  Moreover,  banks  that  have  not \ndisbursed 80% of their allocation and met their financial inclusion targets within 5 months are \nnot eligible to participate in the next semiannual allocation, effectively ceding more funding to \ntheir competition. \n \n8.  This mix of incentives and disincentives has worked well. To avoid being penalized and \nexcluded from future funding rounds amid a restrictive monetary climate, banks have overshot \ntheir financial inclusion targets. Capitalizing on the results of these incentives, ADB and the \ngovernment increased after the first 12 months the amount available at each funding round and \nraised the financial inclusion targets. Despite higher targets, banks have continued to perform \nbeyond expectation (Figure). The additional financing continues this approach, which the Sri \nLanka Solar Rooftop Development Project has adopted as well.7 \n \n \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan  and \nAdministration of Technical Assistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project. Manila. \n6  The original project ran a pilot allowing banks to bid on their borrowing rate. Because the auction limited \nparticipation,  the  government  requested  a conventional allocation system  that  allowed  all  eligible banks to \nparticipate. However, the banks continue both to identify their borrowing quantity and to incur a financial penalty for \nnonperformance. \n7  ADB. 2017.

Based on banks\u2019 positive response to project incentives, ADB and MOF increased the targets in February 2017. \n2. Targeted SMEs include SMEs that are (i) located outside of Colombo District, (ii) borrowing for working capital \nwhere fixed or financial assets are not pledged as collateral, (iii) led by women, or (iv) first-time borrowers of a \nlicensed or specialized commercial bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  The  original  project  included  incentives  for  banks  to  establish  an  ADB-compliant \nenvironmental and social safeguard management program. Participating banks can only lend to \nsubprojects  classified  category  B  for  the  environment  if  they  have  an  ADB-approved \nenvironmental and social management system. Otherwise, lending is limited to subprojects \nclassified category C for the environment. At project inception, only three banks had ADB-\napproved safeguard systems. Recognizing their competitive disadvantage, two banks have \nsince introduced safeguard systems and four more banks are working with ADB to develop their \nown. Collectively, these nine banks are responsible for more than 80% of lending in Sri Lanka. \n \n10.  The original project also strongly emphasized data collection. Little information  was \navailable on SMEs or their borrowings when the original project was structured. To rectify this \nshortcoming, the technical assistance (TA) attached to the original project funded a third party to \ncollect data on the SMEs participating in the project. This data is publicly available and can be a \nresource  to  the  government,  other  development  agencies,  and  academics.8  This  sound \nmanagement information system strengthens subproject monitoring and implementation. \n \n11.  This data also provides insights into how the project is helping SMEs. For example, as of \nMay 2017, 26% of the SMEs had taken a previous loan from the same bank. With their own \nfunds, those banks extended the loans for an average of 49 months, but with ADB funds, the \naverage  tenor  increased  by  31%.  The  longer  tenor  of  ADB  funding  also  supports  capital \nexpenditures,  which  represent  a  clear  majority  of  investment  activity.  The  manufacturing \nindustry  has  been  one  of  the  prime  beneficiaries  and  has  received  17%  of  the  funding. \nMoreover, the data provides insights into these SMEs. First-time borrowers, for instance, are \ngenerally newer businesses with seven employees on average; other SMEs have about 30. \nOnly businesses owned solely by women are managed entirely by women, which underlines the \n                                                \n8  ADB.

Rationale  for  additional  financing.  Given  the  project\u2019s  strong  performance\u2014\nparticularly in reaching SMEs that are first-time borrowers, women-led, or located outside of \nColombo\u2014and its compliance with ADB\u2019s additional financing eligibility criteria, the government \nrequested $150 million to scale up this project for four more funding rounds of $37.5 million \neach.11 Given other demands on Sri Lanka\u2019s resource envelope, ADB and the government \neventually agreed to an additional funding request of $75 million for three more rounds of $25 \nmillion each. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project\u2019s impact and outcome are unchanged. The impact will be that employment \nopportunities in SMEs have increased.12 The outcome will be that SMEs\u2019 access to finance has \nbeen strengthened. The additional financing increases the outcome indicator\u2014$50 million to be \nlent via the credit line to SMEs that are (i) located outside of Colombo District, (ii) borrowing for \nworking capital, (iii) led by women, or (iv) new borrowers\u2014to $102.5 million. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Financing to SMEs through formal intermediaries increased. The original \noutput of disbursing $100 million to participating banks by 2020 will be raised to $175 million. \n \n15.  Output 2: Innovative SME financing schemes developed. This output is unchanged. \nThe original performance indicators, which established the auction pilot in June 2016 and \nprepared a proposal for a Sri Lankan SME credit guarantee institution in December 2016, have \nbeen achieved. Sri Lanka\u2019s cabinet has since approved the proposal to establish an SME credit \nguarantee institution, which ADB is actively supporting. \n \n16.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  SMEs  in  targeted  clusters  to  access  financial  services \nenhanced. This output is unchanged. The TA attached to the original project is funding this \nactivity,  and  its  work  is  scheduled  for  completion  by  2018.13  The  targeted  clusters  are \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) and business process outsourcing, fruits and \nvegetables, and processed food and beverage. \n \n17.  Output 4: International competitiveness of the ICT\u2013business process outsourcing \ncluster strengthened. The TA attached to the original project funded this activity (footnote 13). \nThe output is unchanged and will increase the presence and networks of women interested or \nworking in ICT and business process outsourcing. \n                                                \n9  Data is based on the portfolio of 292 subloans as of May 2017, and figures will evolve as the portfolio grows. \n10 Impact Stories (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 The project meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing. It (i) remains technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the project\u2019s \nexpected outcome; and (iv) is consistent with the current country partnership strategy. \n12 Government of Sri Lanka. 2017.

The original project was estimated to cost $100.0 million. With the additional financing, \nthe total project cost is estimated at $175.0 million (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nAdditional \nCurrenta  Financing  Total  Share of Totalb \nSource  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank         \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  100.0  75.0  175.0  100.0 \nTotal  100.0  75.0  175.0  100.0 \na  Refers to the original amount. \nb  The share of total is constant for both current and additional financing. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  With 5 years as the average duration of an SME loan in the original project, banks can \nreuse the funds twice during the 10-year borrowing period. Moreover, SMEs have contributed \non average 35% equity to the subprojects. The combined effect is that ADB\u2019s $175 million is \nexpected to support $538 million of SME subprojects.14 \n \n20.  The government has requested a regular loan of $75 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan \nand project agreements. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches of about $25 million each. \nEach tranche will have a 10-year term and a disbursement-linked bullet repayment. Based on \nthe foregoing, the average loan maturity is 11 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The government will relend the local currency equivalent to participating banks at the \nbanking industry\u2019s average weighted deposit rate, and will assume the foreign exchange risk. \nThe  loans  will  have  10-year  tenors  and  bullet  repayments  that  mirror  the  government\u2019s \nrepayments to ADB. \n \n22.  An  increase  in  the  banks\u2019  development  targets  is  the  biggest  change  in  the \nimplementation arrangements from the original loan. For a bank to qualify for a subsequent \nfunding round, \n(i)  20% of the number of subloans (previously 10%) must be to first-time borrowers \nof a licensed commercial or specialized bank; \n(ii)  20%  of  the  number  of  subloans  (previously  5%)  must  be  to  SMEs  led  by \nwomen;15 \n                                                \n14 ($175.0 million ADB funding + $94.2 million estimated average SME equity contribution) x (10 years) / (5-year \nestimated average loan duration) = $538.4 million. \n15 Defined as led by a woman, at least 51% of the enterprise ownership is controlled by women, at least 60% of \nsenior managers are women, or at least 50% of board members are women. \n ", "6 \n(iii)  70% of the amount of subloans (previously 50%) must be lent cumulatively to the \ntargeted SMEs, which include SMEs that are (a) located outside of Colombo \nDistrict, (b) borrowing for working capital that is not collateralized by fixed or \nfinancial assets, (c) led by women, or (d) first-time borrowers from a licensed \ncommercial or specialized bank; and \n(iv)  80% of the amount (no change) of a bank\u2019s allocation must be onlent. \n \n23.  Subject  to  continued  satisfactory  performance,  the  10  participating  banks  from  the \noriginal project are expected to remain in the project.16 The selection criteria included (i) central \nbank confirmation that the bank is in good regulatory standing (including corporate governance, \nreputation, integrity, and anti-money laundering procedures); (ii) compliance with the central \nbank\u2019s regulatory capital norms;17 (iii) tangible equity of at least SLRs1 billion; and (iv) ADB\u2019s \nown  due  diligence  on  the  banks\u2019  financial  strength,  financial  management,  integrity,  and \ngovernance. \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).18 The government has expressed potential interest in \nfurther additional financing should the project continue to perform well. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013March 2020 \nEstimated completion  31 March 2020 \ndate \nEstimated loan closing  30 September 2020 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee, including the secretary or deputy secretary to the \nTreasury (chair), Department of External Resources, Department of \nDevelopment Finance, ADB, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Department of \nProject Management and Monitoring, Export Development Board, and \nFederation of Chambers of Commerce \n(ii) Executing agency  Ministry of Finance and Mass Media \n(iii) Implementing agency  Department of Development Finance \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit with nine staff members, under the leadership of \nthe director general, Department of Development Finance \nProcurement  Participating financial institutions will use the loan funds as described in \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) for \nloans to financial intermediaries (para. 3.12). \nConsulting services  Consultants retained under the original project will continue to work during \nthe additional financing and include a safeguard specialist, a project \nofficer, and a consulting firm that is implementing the cluster development \nwork. \nDisbursement  ADB will disburse the loan proceeds following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The project is economically and financially viable. Economically, the gains are likely to \ncome from the project\u2019s requirement to lend to SMEs that are struggling to access the banking \nsystem. Providing SMEs with better access to finance has a multiplier effect because SMEs can \nborrow to (i) invest in more productive technologies and (ii) enlarge their businesses to achieve \neconomies of scale. These gains are especially significant in economies such as Sri Lanka\u2019s, \nwhere unmet SME credit demand is significant.19 Financially, the banks assess each subproject \nfor its capacity to make timely repayment. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s financial management and integrity due diligence on each participating bank \nindicates moderate risk. The project\u2019s design includes several governance mechanisms, such \nas (i) steering committee oversight, (ii) well-developed project reporting that provides detailed \ndata on the subloans, and (iii) other measures detailed in the PAM. With these measures, the \noverall financial management arrangements are considered adequate. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Mass  Media.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Poverty impact. Although Sri Lanka has made notable progress in reducing poverty, \nregional imbalances remain. SMEs struggle to borrow for working capital because they often \nlack real estate or financial assets that banks require as collateral. In response, the project \ntargets SMEs that have less access to financial resources but have a key role in reducing \nincome  and  social  imbalances.  These  SMEs  are  (i)  located  outside  of  Colombo  District, \n(ii) borrowing for working capital without pledging financial assets or real estate, (iii) led by \nwomen,  or  (iv)  first-time  borrowers  from  a  licensed  commercial  or  specialized  bank.  The \nexpected project impact includes employment creation and increased income, especially among \nthe targeted SMEs. \n \n29.  Gender and social dimensions. Sri Lanka\u2019s low female labor participation rate of 39% \nsuggests a large pool of untapped human resources for national economic development. One \nmeasure to address this is to support women\u2019s greater involvement in SMEs. Thus, the project \nis  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  because  of  its  large  potential  to  contribute  to \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and gender equity. In view of this, the project requires at least 20% of \n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nsubborrowers to be SMEs led by women. This is a fourfold increase in the original project\u2019s \ntarget, which has been raised because the banks\u2014when properly incentivized\u2014have proven \nthat they can identify creditworthy SMEs led by women.20 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified financial \nintermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project \ncomplies with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. Subproject selection \ncriteria will ensure that participating banks exclude SME subprojects with activities under ADB\u2019s \nProhibited Investments Activity List and with involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples \nimpacts (category C). For the environment, the rules for participating banks are: \n(i)  Exclude all subprojects with environmental impacts (categories A and B). These \nbanks may only lend to subprojects that are included in an ADB-preapproved list \nof subprojects21 or that the project management unit\u2019s safeguard specialist has \nconfirmed as category C for the environment. \n(ii)  Exclude subprojects with significant safeguard impacts (category A) but include \nsubprojects with impacts that are not significant (category B). ADB will require \nthese banks to maintain a safeguard and environmental management system \nthat complies with ADB requirements and national laws.22 \n \n31.  Safeguard  due  diligence  concluded  that  five  banks  currently  have  safeguard  and \nenvironmental management systems that meet ADB\u2019s standards. Due diligence also suggests \nthat most of the subprojects classified category B for the environment will involve small-scale \nbuilding  construction,  the  risks  of  which  are  manageable.  As  part  of  the  original  project\u2019s \nimplementation, an ADB safeguard officer has conducted site visits to 12 subprojects and did \nnot identify any material environmental or safeguard issues. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  The project\u2019s overall risk is low. Its benefits are expected to outweigh its costs. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nSome participating banks cannot  Three months after the fund allocation date, participating banks \nmeet the onlending disbursement and  are required to start paying interest to the government on their \ndevelopment targets because of poor  allocation, even if the bank has not yet onlent the funds to a \nmanagement.   subloan.
