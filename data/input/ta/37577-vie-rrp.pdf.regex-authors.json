Environmental implications were reviewed and no \nAssessment  adverse environmental impacts identified. \n   \nProgram Rationale  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported Viet Nam's \nfinancial sector strategy since 1996 through program loans that \nhelped the Government articulate a vision of a modern broad-\nbased financial sector with strong intermediaries, well-functioning \nmarkets,  and  legal  and  regulatory  infrastructure  that  promotes \nstability. The strategy envisions the need to address core issues \nincluding  developing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and \nbuilding institutional capacities over the long term. \n \nWhile the initial focus of ADB support was to strengthen the legal \nframework  for  banking,  greater  focus  since  has  been  on \ndeveloping a wider range of legal and regulatory structures that \ncan underpin development of broad-based financial markets. \n   \n  Financial sector development is central to continuing Viet Nam's \ngrowth momentum. The Government's strategy for sustaining high \ngrowth relies on attaining high investment of as much as 40% of \ngross  domestic  product,  including  public  investment.  While \ndomestic savings rates are high and likely to continue to rise given \nfavorable demographics, and foreign direct investment into the \neconomy is increasing, the ability to sustain the targeted high \ngrowth  will  require  increased  financial  intermediation  and \nimproved efficiency of resource allocation. The banking system, \nwhich still dominates the financial sector, is limited in its ability to \nprudently  transform  its  short-term  liabilities  into  long-term \nfinancing of investment. There is a need, therefore, to foster a \ndiversified financial sector in Viet Nam to support sustainable high \ninvestment and growth by developing the nonbank financial sector \nthrough improved capital markets. \n ", "ii   \n  FSPL  III  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government's  new  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  (SEDP),  approved  in \n2006, which not only targets middle-income status by 2010 but \nalso envisages industrial country status for Viet Nam by 2020. To \nachieve these goals the SEDP strongly emphasizes the objectives \nof business development, private investment, and a continuing \ntransition to a market-based system with greater integration with \nthe  global  economy.  ADB's  country  strategy  and  program  for \n2007\u20132010 is congruent with the Government's SEDP, supporting \nbusiness-led  pro-poor  growth  through  promoting  infrastructure \ndevelopment,  a  business-enabling  environment,  and  financial \nintermediation. \n \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The objective of FSPL III is to create a more diversified, deeper, \nand more resilient financial sector. The bank-dominated financial \nsector  cannot  adequately  finance  the  economy\u2019s  investment \nneeds. FSPL III will lead to an increased share of capital markets \nin the financing of domestic investment, which will promote and \nfacilitate sustained high growth in the economy with reduced risks. \nDevelopment of diversified capital markets will result in increased \nefficiency  of  financial  intermediation  in  the  economy,  more \nefficient  allocation  of  resources,  and  a  sound  macroeconomic \nenvironment that is more resilient to external and regional shocks. \nFSPL III will also support Government efforts to promote greater \nregional cooperation through cooperation with regulators of other \nsecurities markets in the region. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A  loan  of  $75,000,000  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  will  be  provided  for  subprogram  1  of  the  program \ncluster. The loan will have an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.  \n   \nPeriod and Tranching  The implementation period for the program cluster is from January \n2006  to  September  2010;  subprogram  1  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted  14  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  for \nsubprogram 1 will be released in two tranches: SDR 19,116,000 \nupon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and \nSDR 28,674,000 subject to fulfillment of specified second tranche \nrelease  conditions.  Subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board \nconsideration approximately 30 months after the effectiveness of \nsubprogram 1, subject to adequate progress of reforms and the \nGovernment\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of reform and to help maintain current social \nexpenditure. ", "  iii\n   \nExecuting Agency  State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) \n   \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  including  the  State  Securities \nArrangements  Commission (SSC), will be the Implementing Agency. SBV will be \nresponsible  for  overall  program  implementation,  including \nadministration and disbursement of loan proceeds, maintenance \nof accounts, and preparation of semiannual progress reports on \nprogram implementation. To coordinate program implementation \namong  different  Government  agencies  concerned,  a  program \nsteering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by \nSBV, will comprise senior officers from all government agencies \nconcerned, including SBV, MOF, and SSC. The PSC will meet on \na semiannual and ad hoc basis to review pending issues and \npropose  concrete  actions  for  their  resolution  to  ensure  timely \nprogram implementation. SBV will form a program implementation \nand coordination unit, headed by a senior SBV officer, to assist \nthe PSC and ADB and have responsibility for day-to-day program \nimplementation.  Reforms achieved under FSPL III, subprogram 1 \nhave been supported by close policy dialogue as well as technical \nassistance support. \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance import costs (excluding \nDisbursement  local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  all  imports \nfinanced  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  Development of capital markets and a diversified financial sector \nBeneficiaries  will  help  mobilize  resources  and  allocate  them  efficiently.  The \nincreased financial intermediation will help Viet Nam achieve and \nsustain  its  ambitious  growth  program.  Well-developed  capital \nmarkets will provide government and private sector with access to \nmedium- and long-term funds, thus enabling a wider variety of \nprojects to be financed in the economy. They will also provide \ncompetition to the banking system, thus contributing to increased \nefficiency  of  banking  and  of  the  financial  sector  as  a  whole. \nGovernment debt market development will help the economy by \nproviding a benchmark yield curve that can help pricing of other, \nriskier assets, and contribute to development of markets for such \nassets. Successful development of the shorter-term debt markets \nwill  help  increase  effectiveness  of  the  monetary  policy  and \nfacilitate improved monetary policy management. \n \n ", "iv   \n  A  well-developed  financial  system  is  the  heart  of  a  modern, \nindustrialized economy. Consequently, benefits of FSPL III will be \nspread across all sectors of the economy. For example, improved \ninvestor protection in securities markets will benefit large as well \nas  small  investors,  including  providing  households  with \nmechanisms  to  invest  savings  safely.  Stronger  protection  for \nconsumers in insurance will benefit all consumers, while enabling \nnew  insurance  products  to  be  introduced  to  the  market. \nDevelopment of the leasing sector will provide firms, including \nsmall- and medium-sized firms, access to alternative sources of \nfinancing for their capital requirement. Increased access to long- \nand medium-term finance will benefit larger firms undertaking job-\ncreating investment projects that otherwise may not be viable. \nExperience with more developed securities markets will enhance \nthe knowledge base and skills of investors and other participants \nin  financial  markets  to  better  benefit  from  integrating  global \nmarkets. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  FSPL  III  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Government's  plans  for \ndeveloping  the  financial  sector,  particularly  securities  markets. \nNonetheless, program implementation is subject to potential risks: \n \n(i)  Exogenous, regional financial shock. The first risk is the \npossibility of a large exogenous shock in the form of a \nregional financial crisis. The economy is benefiting from its \ngrowing integration with global trade and financial flows, \nbut this also leaves it more vulnerable to such shocks. \nHowever, concerns at this stage are not regional per se but \nmore  related  to  global  imbalances  in  savings  between \nAsian countries and others, and spillover effects of crisis in \nthe subprime mortgage lending markets. Viet Nam, for its \npart,  has  a  very  sound  external  outlook  with  modest \ncurrent account deficits/surplus, an exchange rate that is a \nmanaged float and not tied to any currency, and limited \nexternal  borrowing.  The  recent  liquidity  crisis  has  not \naffected Viet Nam adversely. \n  (ii)  Possible  unsustainable  asset  price  bubble  in  the \nequity  market. A second potential risk relates to rapid \ngrowth in Viet Nam's equity markets, and the likelihood \nthat  there  may  be  an  asset  bubble  that  may  not  be \nsustained. The securities markets regulator, SSC, is quite \naware  of  this  risk  and  is  seeking  to  increase  investor \nawareness. At the same time, minor market corrections, if \nany,  would  actually  help  to  strengthen  FSPL  III \nimplementation  by  underlining  the  importance  of  high \ntransparency and investor protection in capital markets. ", "  v\n  (iii)  Political  resistance  and  vested  interests  may  slow \nreforms. Implementation of the FSPL III program initiatives \nmay get delayed due to resistance from vested interests \nand those opposed to the reforms. However, this risk is \nconsidered slight since the Government has so far shown \nimmense resolve and commitment to pursuing the reform \nagenda. Government commitment is also manifest in the \nscope  of  legal  and  regulatory  changes  already \nimplemented  in  the  financial  sector,  as  well  as  in  the \nproposed  reforms  in  both  the  bank  and  the  nonbank \nfinancial subsectors. \n  (iv)  Protectionist  backlash  against  liberalization  and \nincreased foreign competition. The urgency of reforms is \nin some cases associated with commitments made by the \nGovernment  in  the  process  of  accession  to  the  World \nTrade Organization; for example, liberalization of foreign \nentry into banking has focused energy on reforming and \nstrengthening state-owned banks and partially privatizing \ntheir ownership. If domestic firms are unable to withstand \nthe  competition,  including  in  nonfinancial  sectors  of  the \neconomy,  there  could  be  organized  opposition  to  such \nreforms, resulting in a slowdown or even reversal in some \ncases.  However,  the  economy  has  been  growing  fast \nthrough the decade, export growth has been strong, and \nthe risk of perceived vulnerability to foreign competition \nappears low. \n  (v)  Poor  governance  and  corruption.  These  may  erode \neffectiveness and implementation of the reform initiatives. \nHowever,  the  Government  is  increasingly  adopting  a \ntougher stance against corruption and recently undertook \nseveral  legal  reforms,  including  enactment  of  the  Anti-\nCorruption Law, and setting up of a steering committee \nagainst corruption, headed directly by the Prime Minister. \nThe  Government  has  established  a  legal  framework  to \nprotect  and  reward  whistle-blowers  against  corruption. \nSpecific program components will contribute to reducing \ncorruption  by  enhancing  standards  of  disclosure  and \ntransparency, focusing on strengthening the regulator for \nimproving  surveillance  and  monitoring  of  securities \nmarkets,  and  increasing  coordination  and  information \nexchange among regulatory agencies. \n  (vi)  Insufficient  technical  capacity  of  government \nagencies. Limited technical capacities of SBV, MOF and \nSSC, which as executing and implementing agencies will \nbe  managing  complex  institutional  change,  may  slow \nprogram  implementation.  However,  the  Government's \nrecord and ADB's experience in the country suggests that \nthese  constraints  are  substantially  ameliorated  given \nadequate support and technical assistance. To reduce this \nrisk, an ADB technical assistance will be proposed early in \n2008 to help implement FSPL III. \n ", "vi   \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Third  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan  (FSPL  III)  comprising  two \nsubprograms to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1 of \nthe program cluster. The program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Viet Nam has continued its impressive economic performance this decade, with average \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  per  annum  exceeding  7%  during  2002\u20132006  and \nexpected to exceed 8% during 2007\u20132010 (Table 1). This is consistent with the Government's \nobjective of achieving middle-income status by 2010. The rapid growth has been accompanied \nby a stable outlook for both fiscal and external balance, and a remarkable shift towards a \nmarket-oriented  economic  system,  through  wide-ranging  reforms  and  liberalization,  marked \nmost recently by the country's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in January \n2007. Poverty in Viet Nam has declined rapidly in the past decade, from 37.4% in 1998 to \n19.5% in 2004; other social indicators of development are also showing improvement, including \ninfant and maternal mortality, child malnutrition (under 5 years), and access to safe water.  \n \n3.  In 2006, the Government approved the new Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u2013\n2010 (SEDP), which not only targets middle-income status by 2010 but also envisages industrial \ncountry status by 2020 through increasing average GDP per capita (about $622 in 2005) to \n$1,050\u2013$1,100  by  2010.  While  reaffirming  the  socialist  orientation  of  the  economy  and \npromoting a prominent role for the state in investment-led growth, the SEDP also strongly \nemphasizes the objectives of business development, private investment, continuing transition to \na market-based system, and increased integration with the global economy. Consistent with the \nSEDP, the country strategy and program1 2007\u20132010 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nViet Nam is consistent with the SEDP, and supports business-led pro-poor growth through \npromoting  infrastructure  development,  a  business-enabling  environment,  and  financial \nintermediation. \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n Item  2004  2005  2006  2007a \nReal GDP Growth (%)  7.5  8.1  8.0  8.3 \nGross Investment (%GDP)  35.5  37.6  38.4  39.1 \nPrivate Investment (% total investment)  53.6  52.2  53.6  54.2 \nPublic Investment (% total investment)  46.3  47.7  46.4  45.8 \nGross Savings (% GDP)  32.3  35.6  35.8  36 \nInflation (annual average)  7.7  8.2  7.5  7.5 \nCredit Growth (%)  41.8  31.6  22.6  21 \nExports Growth (in dollar terms) (%)  31.4  22.4  20  21 \nImports Growth (in dollar terms) (%)  26.5  15.6  18  19 \nFiscal Balance (% GDP)  3.8  (2.8)  (5.0)  (5.0) \nCurrent Account Balance (%GDP)  (5.7)  (3.6)  (2.1)  0.2 \n( ) = negative. \na Estimated. \nSources:  General  Statistical  Office;  State  Bank  of  Vietnam;  Ministry  of  Finance;  Asian \nDevelopment Bank. 2007.

Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. ", "2   \n  2\n \n4.  GDP growth in FY2006, estimated at 8%, was driven by strong demand, including 20% \ngrowth in exports in dollar terms. The ratio of exports to GDP increased from about 46% in 2000 \nto 66% in 2006, indicating growing openness of the economy even before Viet Nam joined \nWTO. The structure of exports is becoming more diversified; commodities such as crude oil, \nrice, marine products, and coffee remain important, but the share of manufactured products is \nrising. Exports of clothing, electronics, and wood products each expanded by at least 20% in \n2006.  Viet  Nam  is  committed  to,  and  benefiting  from,  growing  integration  with  the  global \neconomy. \n \n5.  Unlike several other economies in the region, Viet Nam's rapid growth is relatively more \nbalanced, driven by both external and domestic demand. Rising consumption and investment \nwere both manifest in the robust growth in domestic demand in FY2006. Growth in private \nconsumption  was  supported  by  rising  incomes  and  inward  remittances  of  about  $4 billion. \nInvestment remained high at 38.4% of GDP. Private investment, which now comprises more \nthan  half  of  all  investment,  was  encouraged  by  further  simplification  of  administrative \nprocedures for businesses and moves toward equality of treatment between state enterprises \nand the private sector and between domestic and foreign enterprises. Domestic private sector \ngrowth has been accelerating and its share in GDP is increasing gradually. Additionally foreign \ndirect investment commitments rose to $10.2 billion in 2006, the highest since the country \nopened to investment in 1986.  \n \n6.  Inflation continues to be a concern, exceeding 7% on average during 2006 for the third \nyear in a row. In February 2007 inflation declined to 6.5% but then rose to 7.6% in June. \nInflationary pressures reflect several factors, including growth in aggregate demand, high world \ncommodity prices, and monetary expansion triggered by incomplete sterilization of the high and \nrising capital inflows into the economy. Administered domestic fuel prices were raised in April \nand in August 2006 by a cumulative 18.5%, and then reduced twice by a cumulative 12.5%. \nSubsidies have been largely eliminated for gasoline and kerosene, and the Government plans \nto eliminate fuel subsidies completely next year. The minimum salary of civil servants was \nincreased by 30% in October 2006, a component of civil service reforms, resulting in second-\nround effects on private sector wages. Domestic credit grew by almost 42% in 2004 and more \nthan 30% in 2005. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) imposed prudential standards in 2005 to \ncurb rapid growth, requiring commercial banks to limit medium- and long-term lending to 40% of \ntheir short-term funds. These restrictions combined with high inflows of foreign currency, in \nterms of remittances and foreign direct investment, contributed to excess liquidity in the banking \nsubsector that SBV reduced by issuing SBV bills and increasing reserve requirements in 2007.  \n \n7.  Viet Nam's strategy for sustaining its high growth into the future relies on attaining high \ninvestment, of as much as 40% of GDP, including public investment. Viet Nam's aggregate \nsavings rate, about 36% of GDP in 2006, is lower than in some of the economies in the region \nbut rising.2 Savings are likely to continue increasing in view of the favorable demographic profile \nof the country, which has one of the youngest populations in Asia with more than 65% of the \npopulation below 65 years of age. The median age of the population is expected to be only 29 \nyears in 2015 (compared with 37 years in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)), and the ratio \nof working to dependent population is expected to continue rising in the medium term, with a \nfavorable impact on aggregate savings ratios.  \n                                                 \n2  The savings to GDP ratio in 2006 was about 47% in the People's Republic of China and 40% in Malaysia. However \nViet Nam's savings rate was comparable to India (33%) and higher than Thailand (30%), Indonesia (29%), and \nPhilippines (21%).  \n ", "    3 \n \n8.  Although  domestic  savings  rates are  likely  to  rise,  and  foreign  direct  investment  is \nincreasing, the ability of the economy to sustain high growth will require increased financial \nintermediation and improved efficiency of resource allocation. The banking system, which still \ndominates the financial sector, will need to be complemented by growth in the capital markets, \nparticularly to finance needed medium- and long-term infrastructure investments by both the \npublic  and  private  sectors.  The  increased  role  of  nonbank  financial  intermediation  in  the \neconomy will be essential to help the country reach its investment and growth objectives in a \nsustainable manner. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n9.  The financial sector is still underdeveloped, inefficient, fragmented, and dominated by \nthe state. Financial deepening, measured by the ratio of broad money, or M2, to GDP has \npicked pace in the past decade, rising from about one quarter in 1997 to more than 80 percent \nin 2007. Nonetheless much of the non-bank financial sector exists in the penumbra of the \nbanking system, which in turn is dominated by the public sector. The formal financial system is \nyet to go beyond the early stages of development and cash is even now the most commonly \nused payment instrument across the economy, with US dollars widely used for payments of \ngoods and services. More detailed analysis of the financial sector is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n10.  Banking sector remains underdeveloped, though cautious and persistent reforms \ncontinue. The banking sector has grown significantly since the adoption of the Law on Credit \nInstitutions in 1998. The law allowed a variety of products to be offered by credit institutions and \nintroduced  prudential  provisions  including  capital  norms,  restrictions  on  asset/liability \nmanagement, deposit insurance and limits on investments by credit institutions in real estate. \nThe number of banks increased due to lowered entry barriers: there are currently 37 joint stock \nbanks, 5 joint venture banks and 31 foreign banks in addition to 5 state-owned commercial \nbanks (SOCBs) and two development and policy banks. Both loans and deposits of the banking \nsector have grown rapidly since 1998, at average annual growth rates exceeding 25 percent. \nThe  share  of  SOCBs  has  been  declining,  though  they  still  dominate  the  banking  sector, \naccounting for nearly 70 percent of all deposits, and 69 percent of total lending in 2005; by way \nof comparison, SOCB share in total lending was 73 percent in 2001. The share of SOCB \nlending  going  to  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  has  also  been  declining,  as  has  the \nimportance of policy-based lending in their operations. \n \n11.  Restructuring of the banking subsector has sought to improve the legal, regulatory, and \nsupervisory  framework  of  banking,  and  to  address  problems  of  nonperforming  assets, \nparticularly of SOCBs, by enhancement of capital and enlarging the scope of SOCBs to operate \non sound market principles.3 Banking reforms have acquired added urgency given Viet Nam's \ncommitment under WTO accession to liberalize foreign entry into its banking system from 2007. \nA banking system reform road map has been developed under which all SOCBs will gradually \nbe equitized and international prudential standards applied by 2010. In preparation for the \nequitization  of  the  SOCBs,  the  standards  for  financial  disclosure  for  SOCBs  have  been \nimproved closer to international standards and the equity stake allowed to foreign strategic \n                                                 \n3  Banking sector reforms are also supported by the aid community through the World Bank's Poverty Reduction \nSupport Credit (PRSC).

Maturing  insurance  sector  needs  to  build  on  achievements.  The  commercial \ninsurance industry is relatively young, having been established in December 1994. It has grown \nrapidly in the past 5 years, with high double-digit annual growth in premiums between 2002 and \n2004, followed by slower growth of 8.8% in 2005 and 9.9% in 2006. Eight licensed life insurers \nand 15 licensed nonlife insurers are currently operating. In 2006, the insurance industry had \nwritten insurance premiums, net of reinsurance, amounting to D14.9 trillion ($930 million), split \nroughly in proportions of 60%:40% between life insurance and nonlife insurance premiums. The \ngrowth  in  insurance  premiums  represents  an  increase  of  92%  over  the  past  5  years,  yet \namounts to only 1.65% of GDP.  \n \n13.  High growth of the industry primarily reflects the low base at the start. The industry is still \nunderdeveloped in terms of premium penetration (which is half that of the PRC and India,5 and \nfar from the Government's target of 4.2% of GDP by 2010) and product range. In non-life \ninsurance, a level-playing field seems not to exist, with combined share of international insurers \nonly about 5 percent. International insurers face restrictions insuring SOEs or Vietnamese \nnationals though, with accession to the WTO, many of these licensing restrictions will likely be \nlifted in 2008. The life insurance subsector is concentrated in a single product, the endowment \npolicy, which accounted for 87% of all new life insurance premiums in 2006. The limited product \nrange  also  reflects  inability  of  the  industry  to  offer  genuine  long-term  risk  cover  due  to \nunderdeveloped capital markets, which do not yet allow for insurance companies to match long-\nterm  liability  with  comparably  long-term  assets.  The  industry  is  now  exploring  sale  of \ninvestment-linked products, whose approval process along with relevant regulations is expected \nto be completed in the latter half of 2008.  \n \n14.  Leasing industry is constrained by financial capacity, limited public awareness \nand enforcement. The nascent leasing sector in the country is supervised by the SBV and has \n12 finance leasing companies, 3 of which are joint ventures and 5 are subsidiaries of SOCBs.6 \nThe activities of financial leasing companies are confined to (i) financial leasing for machinery, \nequipment,  vehicles,  and  other  movable  assets;  (ii)  advising  clients on  matters  relating  to \nfinancial leasing operations; and (ii) other services related to financial leasing. Leased assets at \nthe end of 2006 are estimated at about $577 million. Leasing is still a new product in Viet Nam, \nand awareness of its special security features is limited. Growth of the leasing industry is also \nconstrained by lack of adequate financing. Finance leasing companies are permitted to mobilize \nfinancial resources from (i) short-, medium-, and long-term borrowing from credit institutions in \nViet Nam and abroad; (ii) issuance of bonds with a term of more than 1 year (subject to SBV \napproval); and (iii) other means as stipulated in Article 16 of Decree 16. Leasing companies that \nare subsidiaries of SOCBs, currently source all or most of their funds from their parent banks. \n                                                 \n4  Financial consultants for the valuation process for two of the SOCBs have already been hired, with initial public \nofferings scheduled in 2007 and 2008, while the process for the others is ongoing. However, on 10 July 2007, the \nPrime Minister directed government officials to \"re-examine the equitization plan of state-run enterprises in 200.7. \nThe directive followed negative market sentiment in the wake of the initial public offering of Bao Viet Insurance, the \nstate-run insurance company, and may delay some large equitizations planned for 2007. \n5  All three countries, Viet Nam, PRC, and India, had a single state-owned insurance entity for decades before \nopening their doors to competition (India in the 1980s, Viet Nam and the PRC in the early 1990s); all three \neconomies are among the most rapidly growing in the world with similar consumer profiles. \n6  The leasing industry in Viet Nam is governed by Decree 16 (May 2001) as amended by Decree 65 (June 2005), \nCircular No. 8/2001 (September 2001), and Circular No. 6/2005 (June 2005). \n ", "    5 \nUnless  supervised,  this  can  lead  to  excessive  lending  by  banks  through  these  leasing \nsubsidiaries to related parties, and the possibility of regulatory arbitrage on the part of banks. \n \n15.  Capital  Markets:  Heterogeneous  Growth,  Uniformly  Underdeveloped.  Securities \ntrading centers (STCs) were established in 2000 in Ho Chi Minh City (HSTC), and in 2005 in \nHanoi (HaSTC). HaSTC was intended to serve small- and medium-sized enterprises, and will \nbe the official over-the-counter market in the country; while HSTC will be the stock exchange. \nStarting with only five listed companies, HSTC grew modestly to 26 listed companies by late \n2004. Since then, with growing interest from international investors, both exchanges have grown \nrapidly, particularly in 2006; the index for HSTC (VNINDEX) rose from 307.5 in 2005 to 751.8 at \nthe end of 2006, an increase of 144%; the index for HaSTC, which is much smaller, rose by \n152% from 96.2 to 242.9 during the same period. Total company listings at the two trading \ncenters have increased four fold, from 44 to 193, between the end of 2005 and end 2006, while \ntotal market capitalization increased by almost 21 times (from D11 trillion to D231 trillion), or to \n25.0%  of  GDP  in  2006  compared  with  1.3%  at  the  end  of  2005.  The  extent  of  market \nexuberance is evident from noting that the Government had initially set a target for combined \nmarket capitalization of the two exchanges at 10 percent of GDP by 2010, which has been far \nexceeded  already.  The  country  now  has  55  securities  firms  and  18  fund  management \ncompanies. The regulated equity markets are, however, still among the smallest in the region7 \nand small compared with the unregulated market for trading equity in Viet Nam. The latter grew \nout of the ambitious equitization program of SOEs, only a few of which listed in the formal \nexchanges.  \n \n16.  The underdevelopment of capital markets is particularly manifest in the markets for \ngovernment debt, and even more so in case of the corporate debt market. Outstanding bonds \nissued by the State Treasury, Vietnam Development Bank, and municipal governments totaled \nabout D125 trillion at the start of 2007, an increase of almost 635% over the corresponding \nvalue for 2002.8 Nonetheless, outstanding government debt represents only about 13% of GDP. \nThe primary market for government securities is highly segmented due to multiple issues and \ndifferentiated channels of distribution. The State Treasury of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has \nmore than 100 issues per year of dong-denominated treasury bills of 6-, 9-, and 12-month \nmaturity, and bonds with maturity of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years. These are issued through four \nchannels: (i) treasury-bill auctions through SBV, with SBV as the registrar; (ii) bond auctions \nthrough the STCs with the State Securities Commission (SSC) as the registrar, (iii) underwriting \nthrough  syndicates  of designated banks  and securities  firms  with  each  underwriter  as  the \nregistrar, and (iv) direct placement or retails sales of bonds to the public through the national \nnetwork of 600 offices of the State Treasury with each office as the registrar. In addition, SBV \nissues its own short-term securities for purposes of liquidity management. Banks are the largest \ninvestors in the primary debt market; insurance companies have a significant presence in \nlonger-term bonds.  \n \n17.  Although nearly three quarters of outstanding bonds are accounted for by 2\u2013 to 5-year \nnotes, the small volume with a large number of issues and absence of benchmark issues \nreduces the liquidity of any given issue. The primary debt market is characterized by more than \n400 issues listed on the STCs. Illiquidity of the issues is reflected in the secondary market that is \nyet to develop, with most investors buying debt and holding it to maturity. The market for \n                                                 \n7  Market  capitalization  as  percent  to  GDP  in  March  2007  was  higher  in  all  other  countries  in  the  region,  \ne.g., Indonesia (37%), Thailand (65%), Philippines (124%), and Malaysia (180%). \n8  Compared with total outstanding debt of approximately $7.8 billion in Viet Nam, debt outstanding was $75 billion in \nPhilippines, $91 billion in Indonesia, $121 billion in Thailand, and $167 billion in Malaysia. \n ", "6   \ncorporate debt is also quite rudimentary, with only four large companies having issued debt by  6\n \nthe end of 2006 with total outstanding corporate debt at D9.6 trillion or 8% of public debt (one \nfirm had issued debt in 2007 as of October).9 Issuances of debt by subnational entities are also \nextremely limited, with only three municipalities having issued debt to date, including Hanoi and \nHo Chi Minh City.  \n  \n18.  Interbank transactions in the money markets are also still in the rudimentary stage of \ndevelopment, with banks more likely to transact with SBV than with one another and the \ndomestic interbank deposit rate (VNIBOR) carrying bid/ask spreads as high as 0.20%\u20130.25%. \nThe SOCBs that dominate the banking system, in terms of deposits, have been parking their \nexcess liquidity at SBV through open market operations, at interest rates much lower (e.g., more \nthan 350 basis points in May 2007) than those prevailing in the interbank transactions among \njoint stock and other banks. The interbank repurchase (repo) market is constrained by lack of \nsupporting infrastructure as well as absence of standard conventions and contracts. Under \ncurrent regulations banks cannot be members of the Viet Nam Securities Depository (VSD), and \nhave to undertake payment and settlement of securities through securities firms, thus increasing \nthe cost and time of transactions, and the settlement risk. \n \n19.  Market infrastructure is improving but needs substantial further enhancement. \nBasic financial sector infrastructure, such as accounting and auditing, clearance and settlement, \nand payment systems, has been improving, but the process needs to be accelerated. The \nAccounting  Law,  approved  in  2003  and  effective  since  January  2004,  provides  the  legal \nframework for accounting and auditing, along with three implementing decrees: Decree 128 on \npublic  sector  accounting,  Decree  129  on  corporate  accounting,  and  Decree  185  on \nadministrative  penalties  for  accounting  violations.  In  addition,  Decree  105  on  independent \nauditing regulates auditing firms and independent auditors, including professional qualification \nand certification. As of October 2007, MOF has issued 26 accounting standards and 37 auditing \nstandards  in  line  with  international  accounting  standards  (IAS),  but  more  will  be  needed, \nincluding, for example, for different financial instruments. Self-regulating organizations, such as \nprofessional associations of accountants, have a limited role in monitoring and maintaining \nstandards in accounting and auditing practices. \n \n20.  Accounting and auditing have grown rapidly in the past 5 years: the number of auditing \nfirms grew from 9 to 140. Of these, about a dozen are licensed by MOF to provide services to \nlisted  companies  based  on  meeting  a  set  of  threshold  criteria,  including  minimum  capital \nrequirements, number of served clients, number of certified public accountants, and number of \nyears  in  operation.  While  the  number  of  auditors  has  grown,  rapid  economic  growth  has \ncontributed to demand for their services exceeding current capacity. The country currently has \nabout 900\u20131000 certified public accountants and this is expected to increase by about 50% in \nthe next 3 years. Requirements for certification currently include a relevant university degree, 4\u2013\n5 years of work experience, and completion of the qualifying examination conducted by MOF, \nalthough the required industry experience is being beneficially reduced. Foreign qualifications \nfrom  selected  countries  are  recognized  and  individuals  possessing  such  credentials  can \npractice provided they pass the examination. \n \n                                                 \n9  Corporate bond issuance is governed by Decree 52 of 2006 on Public Offering of Corporate Bonds, which requires \na minimum of 100 buyers; and that the issuer have a minimum charter capital of D10 billion, be profitable in the \npreceding year, have no carry-over loss or overdues of more than a year, and offer a clear plan for utilizing the \nissuance proceeds.  \n ", "    7 \n21.  The Government\u2019s Action Plan for Securities Market Development 2006-2010, provides \nthe strategy for securities market development, as approved in the Prime Minister Decision No. \n163/2003/QD\u2013TTg of August 2003. The plan calls for accelerating and coordinating securities \nissuance and listing through promulgation of new Enterprise and Securities Laws, continued \nequitization of SOEs, and tax incentives for companies listing before 2007. The plan also calls \nfor development of bond markets; encouraging general corporations and large firms to issue \ncorporate bonds; establishing credit-rating agencies; and transforming STCs from government-\nowned administrative organizations to privately owned, self-regulating organizations under SSC \nsupervision.  Expansion  of  the  investor  base,  including  through  development  of  fund \nmanagement companies, enhancement of information technology infrastructure of securities \nmarkets, and greater international integration are also addressed. FSPL III, developed through \nwide-ranging  consultations,  is  consistent  with  and  builds  upon  the  approach  of  the \nGovernment's plan for developing securities markets in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n22.  A primary constraint to the development of the financial sector is the absence of well-\ndeveloped capital markets. Development of capital markets will lead to improved allocation of \nresources, enable a wider variety of projects to be financed, provide government and private \nsector access to longer-term funds at lower costs, and improve banking efficiency. More liquid \nmarkets for government debt in particular will facilitate pricing of other riskier financial assets \nwith a direct impact on the degree to which other segments of financial markets can develop risk \nallocation functions. The depth of money and bond markets is an important determinant of the \ntransmission mechanism of monetary policy and of central bank effectiveness. Development of \nthe financial sector in Viet Nam therefore needs growth of deep and liquid capital markets, in \nterms of reduced costs of transacting in these markets, greater breadth of the markets, and \nenhanced participation of investors.  \n \n1.  High Transaction Costs \n23.  Transaction  costs  in  Viet  Nam's  capital  markets  are  high:  the  bid-ask  spread,  for \nexample, for 10-year government bonds was 22.5 basis points in 2006, compared with 2 basis \npoints in Malaysia, 3 in Thailand, and 17 in Indonesia.10 Reduction in costs of transacting, in \nterms of costs of arranging, executing, and settling a transaction, is an important objective. To \nthe extent capital markets trade financial claims on future cash flows, transaction costs are \nstrongly affected by the quality and scope of information available to market participants, and \nthe efficiency of the market infrastructure to ensure prompt and reliable settlement of the trades. \n \na.  Market Information \n \n24.  Greater information availability in the public domain at the levels of markets, participants, \nand products is necessary for lowering information barriers that raise the costs of transacting. \nThis includes market indices; volumes traded for listed securities; daily high and low prices; as \nwell as information on securities intermediaries and on listed companies, such as company \nownership and changes therein (by significant shareholders and company insiders), and audited \nfinancial  statements.  Over  all,  levels  of  transparency  and  disclosure  in  Viet  Nam's  capital \nmarkets need to converge to international standards. The need for greater price transparency \n                                                 \n10  AsianBondsonline. 2006. Local Currency Bond Market Liquidity Survey.  Available: \nhttp://asianbondsonline.adb.org/documents/abm_nov2006.pdf \n ", "8   \nranks among the top three constraints in debt markets according to a 2006 survey of market  8\nmakers in Viet Nam (footnote 10).11   \n \nb.  Accounting, Auditing, and Public Disclosure \n \n25.  The quality of information made available is also important. The increased presence and \nrole of foreign companies and investors that has accompanied Viet Nam's economic reforms \nhave  increased  the  demand  for  improved  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Customers, \nlenders, bankers, and investors increasingly seek information that is truly transparent. The \nGovernment too has recognized the importance of accounting regulations and disclosure of \nfinancial statements to steadily, albeit cautiously, adopt international standards.  \n \n26.  As a result, both auditing and public disclosure requirements and standards have risen \nsubstantially in the recent past. All public companies are now required to publicly disclose \nannually audited financial statements, and the Government issued regulations on uniform format \nfor financial reporting by public companies. A new general accounting system was adopted on \n20 March 2006, with MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. Standards of accounting and auditing \nhowever  need  to  improve  substantially  to  catch  up  with  the  growing  complexity  of  an \nincreasingly  market-based,  rapidly  growing  economy.  Financial  status  and  performance  of \nbanks and other financial companies still lack adequate transparency due to use of historical \ncost-based accounting for investments, classification of loans, and fixed-asset depreciation. \nRegulations for mark-to-market accounting consistent with international accounting standards \n(IAS 32) need to be phased in. Accounting guidelines for several areas of the financial sector, \nsuch as stock exchanges, securities firms, and repo transactions, have yet to be developed. \nIncreasing the standards of accounting and audit requires that the quality of small- and medium-\nsized auditing firms is improved, including by upgrading the quality of examination used for \ncertifying public accountants, and by increasing the monitoring role and responsibilities of self-\nregulating  professional  bodies,  such  as  the  Vietnamese  Association  of  Chartered  Public \nAccountants. \n \nc.  Trading, Clearing, and Settlement Technology \n \n27.  Until 2006, the two STCs in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi provided independent trading \nfloors as well as separate clearing and settlement systems. Since then the institutional and \ntechnological  architecture  of  trading,  clearing,  and  settlement  has  been  improving  with \nintroduction of a central registry\u2014VSD\u2014along with ownership evidenced by book entry and \nconsolidation  under  VSD  of  depository,  clearing,  and  settlement  functions.  However,  VSD \ninherited two separate and different systems that are yet to be integrated within a technically \nunified framework that can interface directly with both the STCs and the auction house (for \ntreasury bills) at SBV. Payment settlement currently is often on a T+2 or a T+3 basis12, and \nneeds to be made more efficient. Both the STCs and VSD were established as part of SSC, the \nmarket regulator, which itself is part of MOF. Their governance needs to be improved by \ntransforming the STCs and VSD into legally separate entities, with a view eventually to allow \ntransfer of ownership to the private sector. \n \n                                                 \n11  The other two factors were identified as improving repurchase agreements (repo transactions), and increasing the \ndiversity of investors, which are both covered in the two following sections.  \n12 The period of time between the settlement date and the transaction date that is allotted to the parties of a \ntransaction to satisfy the transaction's obligations; measured as transaction date plus number of days. \n ", "    9 \n2.  Ineffective Issuance Framework \n28.  Further development of deep and liquid debt markets in Viet Nam will require substantial \nimprovements  in  the  framework  for  debt  issuance.  The  primary  market  for  government \nsecurities is highly segmented due to multiple issues and channels of distribution, and there are \ntoo many issues relative to the total volume of debt, resulting in more than 400 outstanding \nissues listed. Benchmark issues of sufficient volume need to be developed to enhance liquidity. \nThis will require amendments to existing government regulations that constrain buyback of \ngovernment securities as well as reopening of issues, in order to start issuing benchmark issues \nand consolidate and restructure the large number of outstanding debt issues into fewer and \nmore liquid securities. \n \n29.  The excessive number of issuances is accompanied by lack of adequate predictability \nabout the schedule of debt issues, constraining planning by market participants. Although the \ntotal amount of new debt planned is evident at the start of the fiscal year from the Government's \nannual budget, planning by market participants is constrained due to the limited information \nabout planned issuances during the year. MOF provides an issuance calendar with a horizon of \nonly one quarter; however its credibility is affected by the Government not always sticking to the \nannounced calendar if market conditions appear adverse. Predictability of issuances needs to \nbe improved both in terms of reliability of the schedule and its time horizon.  \n \n30.  Development of the primary debt market is further compounded by government efforts to \nsimultaneously control the quantity and price of debt issued by imposing interest ceilings on \neach issuance. In part this reflects government concerns about possible collusion among limited \nbidders in the market, but the price controls are blatantly harmful to market development and \nneed to be removed as early as possible. Elimination of price controls and thence artificially low \nborrowing costs for government will be a potent signal of government commitment to further \ndevelopment of bond markets.  \n \n31.  The underdeveloped primary debt market and the stunted secondary markets ensure \nthat no meaningful benchmark yield curve is available to help price other, riskier assets in the \neconomy.  Developing  this  benchmark  yield  curve  will  require  time,  but  needs  to  start  by \nensuring a healthy market at the short end of the yield curve. A focus on developing the \ninterbank money and repo markets is therefore necessary. Transactions among banks are \nconstrained by lack of adequate trust among participants, and segmentation between the public \nsector banks (SOCBs) and remaining banks. Segmentation and heterogeneity in the money \nmarkets  is  also  manifest  in  the  use  of  different  contracts  among  participants  for  repo \ntransactions. Adoption of a standardized repo contract is important to further development of the \ninterbank repo market. There is also need to allow banks to become full members of VSD so \nthey can reduce transactions costs and settlement risks by settling transactions directly.  \n \n32.  One of the constraints to development of secondary markets for government debt is the \nabsence of a system of primary dealers who will be market makers to enhance secondary \nmarket liquidity. The Government needs to study and evaluate the preferred design of a primary \ndealer system, and prepare a plan for introducing it. Development of an active market for \ncorporate bonds will be facilitated by active primary and secondary markets for government \ndebt, but will need SSC to streamline its approval process for public offerings. In addition, \nimproved disclosure standards will need to be accompanied over time with development of \nindependent credit-rating and bond-pricing agencies, which currently do not exist due to the \nextremely limited market size. An improved framework for corporate debt issuance will lead to \n ", "10   \ngreater  participation  of  other  issuers  in  capital  markets,  including,  for  example,  leasing  1\n0\ncompanies.    \n \n3.  Weak Investor and Consumer Protection Framework \n33.  A  key  to  development  of  capital  markets  in  Viet  Nam  is  enhancing  the  size  and \nheterogeneity of the investors' pool; this is currently constrained by a weak framework for \ninvestor and consumer protection. Despite rapid recent growth, the formal or regulated stock \nexchanges  are  still  substantially  smaller  than  the  unregulated  market  and  strong  investor \nprotection in the regulated markets will help redress the balance. Growing interest from foreign \ninvestors  will  also  entail  improving  the  framework  for  investor  protection.  This  will  require \nregulatory  and  institutional  changes  towards  adoption  of  high  levels  of  transparency  and \ninformation  disclosure,  as  well  as  a  framework  for  investor  protection  consistent  with \ninternational  norms  (standards  of  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions \n[IOSCO]). \n \n34.  Improving  the  investor  protection  framework  will  also  require  an  effective  market \nregulator  with  capabilities  for  high-quality  inspection,  investigation,  surveillance,  and \nenforcement; as well as development of an effective compliance program. The capabilities of \nSSC for undertaking market surveillance and monitoring need to be strengthened, including by \nexpanding and clarifying the role of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) in surveillance and \nmonitoring, and developing operating procedures specifying respective roles and responsibilities \nof the SROs and the market regulator. \n \n35.  The  regulator  also  needs  to  integrate  greater  use  of  information  technology  in  its \nfunctions, and develop a web-based system to facilitate lodgment, monitoring, and resolution of \ninvestor complaints. To enhance transparency and credibility of the market, the regulator should \nalso  make  public  through  its  website  cases  of  regulatory  noncompliance,  along  with  the \nidentities of the parties concerned and the penalties imposed. While ignorance of law is not an \nexcuse,  the  Government  needs  to  expand  over  time  awareness  on  part  of  all  market \nparticipants of the improved regulatory framework, rights of concerned entities, and penalties for \nnoncompliance.  \n \n36.  The  framework  for  consumer  protection  also  needs  to  be  enhanced  in  the  rapidly \nexpanding insurance subsector that will increasingly grow in the complexity of products offered \nand of the resulting regulatory requirements to ensure sound financial status of insurance \ncompanies. As insurance companies seek expansion into new products, such as investment-\nlinked  insurance  plans,  new  regulations  will  need  to  be  developed.  Risk-based  regulatory \noversight  will  need  to  be  introduced;  accounting  standards  and  information  exchange  of \ncompanies with regulators will have to be strengthened. Current laws discriminating against \ntreatment of group life insurance premiums as business deductibles constrain growth of the \ninsurance subsector and will need to be revised.  \n \n37.  ADB has consistently supported, through both the Second Financial Sector Program \n(FSPL II)13 and its predecessor (FSPL I),14 consumer protection through strengthening anti-\nmoney-laundering and consumer deposit insurance. Notwithstanding progress in both areas, \nthere is a need to further consolidate on the gains. The Anti-Money Laundering Information \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2002.

Guidelines will need to be developed and issued to \nfinancial institutions on transaction reporting and know-your-customer requirements, and on \ndevelopment of internal anti-money-laundering procedures. The significance of the Deposit \nInsurance of Viet Nam (DIV) will increase with greater divestment of SOCBs and financial \nliberalization in the banking subsector. The Government is developing a new law on bankruptcy \nof credit institutions and the respective roles of SBV and DIV in the resolution process of such \ninstitutions need to be clarified.  \n \n38.  Growing liberalization and sophistication of the financial sector in Viet Nam is increasing \nthe  urgency  to  shift  away  from  current  institution-based  supervision  towards  functional \nsupervision, as larger financial institutions expand their activities into new areas of operation. In \naddition, the need to improve and increase regulatory coordination among various financial \nsector regulatory agencies is also growing. The Government needs to develop a longer-term \nperspective on structure of financial sector regulatory supervision and assess the relevance of \ndifferent models of supervision and regulation, from a unified financial sector regulator, to \nmultiple but coordinating regulators.  \n \n4.  Inadequate Cooperation with Foreign Securities Regulators \n39.  According to the Government\u2019s action plan for securities market development, Viet Nam \nseeks to integrate with the global financial markets, and has undertaken several commitments \nto liberalize the financial sector in the process of its accession to the WTO. Its regulatory \nhorizon needs to be widened to encompass greater coordination with regional and international \nsecurities regulators and markets, including harmonizing criteria for securities issuing, listing, \ninformation  disclosure,  and  cross-listing  between  ASEAN  (Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations) stock exchanges. With greater liberalization and integration of stock markets, firms \nfrom one country may list to raise capital in securities markets in another. Currently the market \nregulator has limited capacity to monitor foreign investments in the equity markets, and with \neasing of outward capital flows over time, the ability to monitor outward investments will also be \nimportant. Further cooperation with securities regulators in the region in terms of information \nexchange, cooperation in inspections, surveillance over cross-border activities, and cooperation \nin training and capacity building should be developed. Viet Nam also needs to develop a \nstrategy to upgrade its financial system regulatory framework to benchmarks under the IOSCO \nMultilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMOU), and become a signatory to the MMOU. 15 \n \n5.  Lessons  \n40.  ADB has actively supported financial sector reforms in Viet Nam over a decade through \ntwo program loans in 1996 and 2002: FSPL I  and FSPL II. During this period, the nature of Viet \nNam\u2019s  financial  sector  has  transformed  radically  from  the  earlier  system  predicated  on \ngovernment allocation of funds via a single state-owned bank (SBV) to a market-based system \nwhere SOCBs were established and are currently in the process of privatization, foreign banks \nhave entered and are operating, and the Government is increasingly focusing its attention on \ncapital market development. The continuous support has enabled ADB to maintain ongoing \npolicy dialogue with the Government, regulatory agencies, industry associations, and market \n                                                 \n15 IOSCO  adopted  the  IOSCO  Multilateral  Memorandum  Concerning  Consultation  and  Cooperation  and  the \nExchange of Information (MMOU) in May 2002. Currently 34 IOSCO members have signed the MMOU. Regulators \nwho are able to share public and nonpublic information are eligible to sign Appendix A of the MMOU, while \nregulators  that  face  impediments  to  information  sharing  are  eligible  to  sign  Appendix  B.  For  Appendix  B \nsignatories, IOSCO will monitor progress in addressing these impediments. \n ", "12   \nplayers. Reforms under FSPL III, subprogram 1 have likewise been supported by close policy  1\n2\ndialogue as well as TA support.  ADB has also consulted with other development partners   \nsupporting reforms in the financial sector in Viet Nam. The development coordination matrix is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n41.  The  first  program,  FSPL  I,  sought  principally  to  lay  the  legal  and  regulatory \nunderpinnings  for  commercial  banking  while  promoting  the  development  of  more  diverse \ninstitutions, instruments, and markets. FSPL II sought to strengthen alternative channels for \nmarket-based financial intermediation by (i) establishing and strengthening a regulatory and \nsupervisory framework for the insurance industry; (ii) developing a legal framework for the \nleasing  industry;  (iii)  promoting  interbank  and  money  market  development  by  deregulating \ninterest  rates  and  increasing  the  number  of  instruments;  (iv)  fostering  capital  market \ndevelopment by increasing the number of quality shares in the market, strengthening market \nsurveillance, and increasing participation by institutional investors; and (v) improving financial \ninfrastructure such as audit and accounting systems and secured transactions systems. \n \n42.  A key lesson emerging from these programs and reinforced in the program performance \naudit report16 for FSPL I and subsequent reports17 on FSPL II is that financial sector reforms are \ncomplex, involving major changes to the legal and institutional infrastructure, and thus need to \nallow for adequate time and flexibility in design. Designs of earlier programs recognized the far-\nreaching and medium- to long-term nature of these reforms to various extents; this has been \nreflected in continuity of support in key areas over several programs. In addition, program \ndesign  should  incorporate  deep  consultative  processes  and  focus  on  reforms  where \ngovernment  commitment  is  strong.  Given  that  sometimes  the  reform  process  is  long, \nestablishing  and  maintaining  the  reform  process  may  in  some  cases  be  as  important  as \nimmediate program outcomes. The current program has also adopted a cluster approach (like \nthe predecessor FSPL II), over a projected time frame of about 5 years in recognition of the \nneed for flexibility as well as continuity of support over the medium term.  \n \n43.  Effective technical and capacity building support for implementation of reforms as well as \nproject management can also be identified from earlier programs as important to achieving \nsuccessful outcomes. A separate TA is being processed for approval in early 2008 that will \ncontinue building on ADB's ongoing support for the financial sector, through policy development \nand improved regulation in key reform areas, including those identified in the FSPL III program, \nas well as provide for building capacity for project implementation in the Implementing Agencies \nfor the loan. The proposed TA will focus on improving market liquidity in key areas, widening \nproduct and participant range in the markets, and enhanced transparency with diminished \nregulatory interventions, as also strengthening of regulation and supervision. The FSPL III \nprogram and the TA will thus together provide continuity to ADB support to Viet Nam in its \nefforts to develop a modern financial. \n \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003.

FSPL II was characterized by timely completion of policy actions and initial assessments of its \nimplementation are positive. \n ", "    13 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n44.  FSPL III has the objective of creating a more diversified, deeper, and more resilient \nfinancial sector in Viet Nam. The financial sector is currently dominated by the banking system, \nwhich is structurally limited in transforming short-term liabilities (deposits) into loans to finance \nlonger-term investments needed by the economy. By increasing the share of nonbank financial \nmarkets in financing investment, FSPL III will contribute to enabling sustained high growth in the \neconomy with reduced risks. The national development strategy (SEDP) seeks to sustain high \neconomic growth through increased investment, which will require a growing role for capital \nmarkets in providing medium- and long-term funding in a sustainable manner. Development of \ndiversified capital markets will contribute to sustained growth through increased efficiency of \nfinancial  intermediation  in  the  economy,  more  efficient  allocation  of  resources,  and  sound \nmacroeconomic environment that is more resilient to external and regional shocks. FSPL III is \nconsistent with and supports the Government's Action Plan for Securities Market Development \n2006\u20132010, which implements the SEDP 2006\u20132010 and the commitments of the Government \nunder bilateral and multilateral (WTO) agreements. It is also aligned with the country strategy \nand program 2007\u20132010, which highlights the need for supporting financial sector development \nto promote Viet Nam's economic growth. \n \n45.  Capital markets trade financial claims across different points in time and states of nature \nand are therefore extremely information intensive. FSPL III encompasses components aimed at \npromoting the creation and dissemination of information required to enhance price discovery, as \nwell as to improve the quality of the information available, to enable better informed market \ndecisions. The ability of the markets to transact financial claims at low cost is also affected by \nthe market infrastructure for prompt and final settlement of trades. The institutional framework \nfor securities issuance will require coordinated efforts between key government agencies and \nmarket participants to enhance the supply of assets in the capital markets. Enhancing the legal \nand regulatory framework to improve supervision of market conduct, promote transparency, and \nstrengthen investor protection will be key to developing and expanding safe capital markets. \nThe scope of FSPL III also includes strengthening the capacity and functioning of regulators. \nGiven growing integration of global financial markets, and Viet Nam's commitments towards \nfinancial liberalization, greater cross-border regulatory cooperation will promote development of \ncapital markets over the longer term. \n \n46.  Development of capital markets is a complex process, including within its ambit legal, \nregulatory, and institutional reforms, and may thus take time and entail flexibility in adapting to \nchanging circumstances in the reform process. FSPL III therefore proposes use of the cluster \nmodality. The program cluster would consist of two subprograms anchored on the Government's \nreform agenda. The program cluster period will be from January 2006 to September 2010. As \nshown in FSPL III policy matrix (Appendix 4), the actions are undertaken in two phases under \nsubprogram 1, namely, Jan 2006\u2013September 2007 for the first tranche and October 2007\u2013\nFebruary 2009 for the second tranche.  \n \n ", "   \nOverview of FSPLIII and Evolution of Capital Markets In Viet Nam \n11\n44\n  \n \n ", "15 \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n47.  The organizing conceptual framework of FSPL III and its policy actions is development \nof deep and liquid capital markets in Viet Nam. Capital market liquidity has many dimensions \nand varying definitions, but three elements are central to it: ability to transact quickly at low cost, \nacross a wide range of assets, with little impact on market prices.18 The importance of greater \nregional cooperation in the financial sector as articulated in ADB's Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Strategy seamlessly supplements this framework in the context of rapidly integrating \nglobal financial markets.19 The financial sector development and reform agenda of FSPL III is \nthus structured around the following four components:  \n   \n(i)  enhanced market liquidity by lowering of transaction costs, \n(ii)  institutional framework for securities issuance, \n(iii)  investor and consumer protection, and \n(iv)  improved regional cooperation in securities market regulation. \n \n1.  Enhanced Market Liquidity by Lowering of Transaction Costs \n48.  Development  of  information-intensive  capital  markets  is  critically  dependent  on  the \nscope and quality of information available to the market participants. FSPL III encompasses \ncomponents  aimed  at  promoting  the  creation  and  dissemination  of  information  required  to \nenhance price discovery, and promotes the ability of the markets to transact financial claims at \nlow cost by increasing the efficiency of market infrastructure to ensure prompt and reliable \nsettlement of trades. FSPL III supports enhanced market liquidity by lowering transactions costs \nthrough (i) greater market disclosure and dissemination of information, (ii) improved market \ninformation standards, and (iii) better market infrastructure for secondary trading of securities.  \n \na.  Market Disclosure and Dissemination of Information \n49.  Securities Law. The Government has initiated several important initiatives in moving to \na disclosure-based regime for securities markets by adopting a comprehensive new Securities \nLaw in June 2006, which became effective on 1 January 2007, and is a key component of FSPL \nIII. The law expands the jurisdiction of SSC, the market regulator, to include unlisted securities; \nclarifies public offering procedures; codifies the disclosure approach to regulation; and includes \na  framework  for  a  centralized  securities  depository,  investment  funds,  and  self-regulatory \norganizations (SROs). Prior to the new Securities Law, the regulatory framework was based on \ndecrees that defined securities markets quite narrowly in terms of institutions, products offered, \nand  activities  specifically  in  the  securities  trading  centers  (STCs).20 As  noted  earlier,  the \nregulated stock exchanges in Viet Nam are still much smaller than the unregulated markets that \n                                                 \n18  The definition of market liquidity adopted by the study group on market liquidity established by the Committee on \nthe Global Financial System in December 1997 says \"A liquid market is a market where a large volume of trades \ncan be immediately executed with minimum effect on prices.\u201d Market liquidity is also described as including \n\u201ctightness (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), depth (the size of an order flow \ninnovation required to change prices a given amount) and resiliency (the speed with which prices recover from a \nrandom, uninformative shock;\" Kyle, A. 1985.

Manila. \n20 The decrees were Decree 90 of 2003 (Decree 90/2003/ND-CP of August 12, 2003 on functions, tasks, rights, and \norganizational structure of state securities companies), Decree 144 of 2003 (Decree No. 144/2003/ND-CP of \nNovember 28, 2003 on securities and securities markets) and Decree No. 66 of 2004 (Decree No. 66/2004/ND-CP \nof February 19 2004) that merged the SSC into the Ministry of Finance. \n ", "16   \ngrew with the equitization of SOEs, both before STCs were established in 2000, and also after \nwith equitized SOEs that did not list on the STCs. To encourage migration of companies and \ntheir shares into the regulated exchanges, the jurisdiction of the new Securities Law has been \nextended to regulate all public companies21 irrespective of whether or not they are listed.  \n \n50.  Disclosure  Requirements.  The  law  sets  forth  prospectus  disclosure  requirements, \nincluding financial statement requirements; and clarifies liability for prospectuses, the duty to \nupdate prospectus disclosure, and periodic reporting requirements. In addition to disclosure \nobligations,  public  companies  are  required  to  comply  with  principles  of  good  corporate \ngovernance under the law and centrally register and deposit their securities in the centralized \nsecurities depository (VSD). Holders of 5% or more of the voting shares of a public company \nare required to report such ownership to SSC and the exchange on which they are listed, and \nany changes in such ownership exceeding 1% of the total amount of the same class of shares \nin circulation.  \n \n51.  The disclosure requirements under the new law were further clarified by MOF through a \ncircular noting that information disclosure be made in a complete, accurate and timely manner in \naccordance  with  the  law  by  the  General  Directors,  who  are  responsible  for  confirming  or \ncorrecting any information disclosure made by any other person of the Company that may affect \nthe company\u2019s securities price within 24 hours of such disclosure.22 Listed companies are \nrequired to set up their own websites and update information disclosure on a regular basis in \ncompliance with the circular, and to report such information to SSC. The circular also clarifies \nfinancial statement reporting requirements, including timing of submission, and reporting of \nshare  transactions  of  inside  shareholders  of  listed  issuers  (management,  board,  general \ndirector, deputy general director, and chief accountant). \n \n52.  The circular also clarified disclosure requirements of STCs (and stock exchanges). They \nare  required  to  disclose,  among  others,  information  on  securities  transactions  (number  of \nsecurities traded, prices, indices, price fluctuations, orders, and volume). Currently many over-\nthe-counter transactions do not get reported to the STCs. To widen the reach of the new \ndisclosure-based regime in the financial sector, SSC will require traders in 2008 to promptly \nreport over-the-counter transactions in securities registered with VSD to the STCs, including \nprice, volume, and bid/offer spreads. \n \nb.  Improved Market Information Standards \n53.  Accounting Standards. Viet Nam\u2019s accounting standards are based on a gradual and \ncautious adoption of international standards with adjustments for local conditions and capacity \nfor effective implementation. MOF has issued 26 accounting and 37 auditing internationally \nbased  standards.  FSPL  III  will  support  further  enhancement  of  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards  in  Viet  Nam,  including  phasing  in  regulations  for  mark-to-market  accounting \nconsistent with IAS 32 (financial instruments: disclosures and presentation) and, subsequently, \nIAS 39 (financial instruments: recognition and measurement) under the Viet Nam accounting \nsystem. Since implementation of the mark-to-market accounting standards relies on existence \n                                                 \n21  A public company is defined as a joint stock company that has a paid up charter capital of D10 billion or more and \nhas offered shares to the public, i.e., is listed or/and has at least 100 investors (excluding professional securities \ninvestors  defined  as  commercial  banks,  insurance  and  financial  leasing  companies,  and  securities  trading \ninstitutions). \n22  The circular includes forms for disclosing information and provides that information disclosure may be made via \nmass media, including websites of the organization making the disclosure, and may be submitted electronically to \nSSC or the STCs in accordance with SSC and STC rules. \n ", "17 \nof reasonably developed and active markets, MOF will phase in the new accounting standards \n(IAS  32)  in  a  step-by-step  manner  consistent  with  market  development  for  the  asset(s) \nconcerned. MOF will also develop and issue accounting guidelines that currently do not exist for \nthe operation of stock exchanges and securities firms, and for repurchase agreements (repo \ntransactions).  \n \n54.  Accounting and Auditing Services. With the growing complexity of the accounting and \nauditing standards, small- and medium-sized firms are having increasing difficulty effectively \nresponding to their customers\u2019 accounting and auditing needs, especially in areas that involve \ninternational best practice issues. The standards of these accounting and audit firms are still \nlow, and need to be enhanced through issuance of guiding procedures and training. MOF is \ncurrently developing, with ADB assistance, a basic audit program for small- and medium-sized \naudits and training materials for Vietnamese Associations of Chartered Public Accountants to \nuse in training courses for auditors. The standards of accounting and audit services in the \neconomy is monitored by MOF, which has not only issued regulation for controlling the quality, \nbut also issued regulation (revising Decision 59) to upgrade the quality of examination used for \ncertifying public accountants, revising it to be more consistent with the requirements of the \nchanging economy. While the regulating and monitoring of professional standards and quality is \nstill directly under MOF, the role of SROs, such as the Vietnamese Associations of Chartered \nPublic Accountants, needs to be strengthened and greater responsibilities delegated to them. \nSpecification of roles and responsibilities of business associations as SROs and a road map for \ndelegation of such responsibilities from MOF will be included in the new Law on Independent \nAudit to be prepared by MOF and submitted to the Government Office in 2008, which will further \nenhance the legal framework for accounting and auditing services. \n \nc.  Better Market Infrastructure for Secondary Trading of Securities \n55.  Securities Depository. FSPL III addresses the need for improved market infrastructure. \nTo strengthen market infrastructure for secondary trading of securities, the Government has \nestablished VSD as the central registry for listed securities with ownership evidenced by book \nentry. In addition, the Government has consolidated depository, clearing, and settlement under \na single entity, VSD, which is legally separate from the STCs. VSD will serve as a single \ndepository  for  all  tradable  securities,  including  government  securities  and  both  listed  and \nunlisted securities of public companies.  \n \n56.  The market infrastructure will need to continue improving with upgrading required on the \npart of the STCs, VSD, as well as private market participants. Systems of depository members \nwill gradually need to be linked with both the STCs and with VSD itself, and the VSD system will \nin the future need to be linked to the designated settlement bank (currently an SOCB, but \nexpected  to  be  the  SBV  following  equitization  of  the  SOCBs).  The  volume  and  speed  of \ntransactions is constrained at the moment by dependency on a manual upload of orders at the \nSTCs. In addition, VSD reporting of settlement vouchers to the depository members is also \npaper  based,  which  are  then  manually  uploaded  in  the  internal  systems  of  the  market \nparticipant. Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support full implementation of automatic \nsynchronization of records between the VSD offices in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. \n \n57.  Governance: Exchange and Depository Institution. Both the STCs as well as VSD \nwere established as part of the securities market regulator SSC, which in turn is part of MOF. \nFSPL III will support the process of separating the STCs and VSD into legally separate and \ndistinct entities. HSTC has recently become an exchange incorporated as a limited liability \ncompany.  SSC  has  subsequently  approved  the  exchange  rules  relating  to  listing,  trading, \n ", "18   \nmembership, and information disclosure; and required HSTC to enforce these. Both HaSTC and \nVSD will become limited liability companies, with approval from SSC for their relevant rules. The \nprocess will continue to be supported by subprogram 2 of the program cluster, in the form of \npreparation by both STCs (exchanges) for ownership diversification and plans to address issues \nof ownership and good governance.  \n \n58.  Trading Platform: Government Bonds. Since 2006, no new bonds have been listed at \nHSTC;  all  primary  auctions  of  government  bonds  are  to  be  undertaken  at  HaSTC.  The \nGovernment is considering also moving the auction of treasury bills, currently undertaken by \nSBV, to HaSTC. However, the trading platform at HaSTC has limited capacity and currently \nboth stocks and bonds are traded on the same platform. In view of developing the secondary \nmarket  for  government  bonds,  HaSTC  has  submitted  a  plan  to  MOF  for  establishing  a \nspecialized bond trading platform. HaSTC will establish the platform, following Government \napproval and identification of appropriate technical system specifications. \n \n59.  Under the new Securities Law, SSC is to seek to modernize information technology for \nthe securities market, and will in the process develop an information technology plan to enable \nelectronic filings by regulated parties (issuers, public companies, regulated intermediaries), \nsome of whom currently prepare paper-based disclosure filings for submission to SSC for \nreview.  Implementation  of  the  information  technology  plan,  supported  by  subprogram  2  of  \nthe program cluster, will enhance SSC's supervision of securities markets and improve SSC \ncapability to publicly disseminate information.  \n \n2.  Institutional Framework for Securities Issuance \n60.  FSPL III will support policy actions to broaden the capital markets by promoting an \nenhanced  framework  for  securities  issuance,  increasing  the  supply  and  quality  of  assets \navailable to investors.23 Central to this, in the short and medium term, is development of debt \nmarkets, starting with the market for government debt, and leading in turn to an improved \nframework for subnational and corporate debt issuance. Development of a government bond \nmarket is in itself a complex process, and will require continued government commitment as \nwell as strong support by both subprograms of the program cluster. Illiquidity due to multiple \nchannels  and  methods  of  issue,  poor  predictability  of  expected  issuances  and  market \nconditions, excessive  number  of  issues  and  absence  of benchmark  issues,  and  lack  of  a \nbenchmark yield curve are prime characteristics of the debt markets in Viet Nam. Key elements \nof support in subprogram 1 are therefore enhancing government securities issuance, creating \nbenchmark issues, developing the short end of the bond market, and promoting supply of other \nsecurities. \n \na.  Government Securities Issuance to Support the Capital Markets \n61.  Policy Coordination: MOF and SBV. Increased coordination between MOF and SBV is \ncentral to improving securities issuance by minimizing conflict between the Government's cash \nand debt management needs and the central bank's open market operations. The timing and \namounts of government securities issuance may not always coincide with SBV's needs for \nmonetary  policy  management.  Improved  coordination  between  government  debt  and  cash \nmanagement and monetary policy can assist monetary authorities through improved information \n                                                 \n23 Progress with ongoing equitization of SOEs will also affect development of capital markets and in turn be affected \nby it, in terms of ability and willingness of SOEs to list and raise capital in these markets. SOE reform is included in \nthe program loan proposed for 2007 to support implementation of Poverty Reduction Program IV. Another loan \nproposed for 2008 would focus on SOE reforms and corporate governance. \n ", "19 \non intentions of the major issuer of debt in the economy, and also help the Government better \nadjust timing and amount of borrowing based on expected market conditions.  \n \n62.  FSPL III will support the formation of a department-level working group between MOF \nand SBV to improve policy coordination for production of liquidity forecasts and designing of \ngovernment securities issuance. The working group, to be set up by March 2008 following the \nreorganization of MOF, will agree on concrete steps to produce regular liquidity forecasts by \nSBV with inputs from MOF on expected government expenditures and receipts, and issuance \nschedules by MOF for government securities, to improve the flow and predictability of assets to \nthe market. Subprogram 2 will support assessment of the feasibility of institutionalizing a public \ndebt management agency, and promote increasing the length of the government debt issuance \ncalendar to up to 1 year.  \n \n63.  Information Dissemination: Informing the Market. In parallel, efforts will be made to \nimprove the production, dissemination, and quality of debt and budgetary information relevant to \ndebt markets. An internal task force will be set up in MOF to improve coordination within MOF \ndepartments on debt issuance, and to coordinate development of a credible government bond \nissuing strategy that will provide a clear picture of planned portfolio structure and instruments to \nobtain that structure, including identification of benchmark issues. The internal task force will \ndetermine  necessary  steps  to  undertake  government  securities  issuance  in  line  with  the \nobjective  of  promoting  capital  markets,  and  publish  a  calendar  of  issuance,  initially  on  a \nquarterly basis. MOF will introduce quarterly meetings with market participants to exchange \ninformation on debt issuance and the debt markets, and to solicit investors' views on improving \nmarket efficiency. \n \n64.  Development  of  Primary  Dealers.  Current  government  auctions  of  bonds  are \nconstrained by interest ceilings, which reflect a concern against collusion among the few bidders \nparticipating in the auctions. Under FSPL III, the Government will undertake a study of the \nauctioning procedure to identify alternative auctioning mechanisms that are more robust against \ncollusive  bidding  and  develop  a  schedule  for  elimination  of  price  ceilings  on  government \nsecurities  auctions  as  well  as  the  framework  of  monthly  ceilings.  To  promote  market \ndevelopment, the Government will also prepare a study for establishing a system of primary \ndealers in the debt market. \n \nb.  Create Benchmark Issues for Government Securities \n65.  The underdeveloped primary debt market and the stunted secondary markets ensure no \nmeaningful benchmark yield curve is available to help price other, riskier assets in the economy. \nDeveloping benchmark issues will help promote increased liquidity in the secondary market for \ngovernment debt. Under FSPL III, the Government has undertaken three benchmark issues, \nincluding  one  in  May  2007,  on  a  pilot  basis  to  draw  lessons  in  broader  development  of \nbenchmark securities. In particular, the Government has reviewed its Decision No. 46/2006/QD-\nBTC to permit large-size issues and reopening of bond issues, and will revisit Decree 141 to \nissue  guidelines  that  allow  for  buyback  of  government  securities.  These  will  enable  the \nconsolidation  and  restructuring  of  outstanding  debt  securities  to  create  fewer  issues  of \nbenchmark size in the market, to be supported in subprogram 2.  \n \nc.  Develop Short End of the Bond Market \n66.  Interbank  Money  Markets.  Developing  a  benchmark  yield  curve  will  also  require \nstrengthening the short end of the yield curve, by promoting development of the interbank \n ", "20   \nmoney  and  repo  markets.  Activity  in  the  interbank  money  market  is  constrained  by  weak \nincentives for liquidity management on part of banks due to factors such as monthly and \naverage reserve requirements, and high levels of funding liquidity resulting from incomplete \nsterilization against surging capital inflows into the economy. To enhance the incentives for \nincreased liquidity  management  by  banks,  it is  important  to  ensure excess  liquidity  in  the \neconomy is soaked up.24 As part of first tranche actions of subprogram 1, SBV has used open-\nmarket operations to sell treasury bills and SBV bills to absorb excess liquidity. For example, \nbetween January and June 2007, SBV continued to issue SBV bills to sterilize 80 percent of \nnearly VND 100 trillion equivalent of foreign exchange purchases during the year. Combined \nwith increased reserve requirements for banks these actions have helped absorb the excess \nliquidity, and the short term rates in the money market were fully realigned as of August 2007.  \nAt a structural level, segmentation in the money market, between SOCBs on the one hand and \nthe other banks on the other, needs to be eliminated. The segmentation is attributed to lack of \ncredibility  amongst  participating  banks,  a  problem  related  in  part  to  inadequate  quality  of \ndisclosure of financial data by banks, and also to strategic considerations on part of SOCBs to \nconstrain  the  rapid  expansion  of  balance  sheet  and  growth  of  non-state  owned  banks. \nInadequate profit motive of SOCBs, who hold the preponderance of liquidity in the system due \nto extensive branch network, is also a factor. This will be addressed gradually by the ongoing \nprocess of equitization of the SOCBs, who may in their new form seek profits from greater \nliquidity access in the interbank market. Segmentation and heterogeneity in the money markets \nis  also  manifest  in  use  of  different  contracts  amongst  participants  for  repo  transactions. \nDevelopment  of  interbank  repo  markets  will  benefit  from  adoption  of  a  standardized  repo \ncontract for all transactions, and SBV will initiate the process by guiding development of a \nmaster repurchase agreement and using it for all SBV repo . \n \nd.  Enhance Supply of Other Securities \n67.  A well-developed government bond market is typically a forerunner of corporate bond \nmarket development, providing institutional and operational infrastructure that can also help \ndevelop  corporate  bond  issuance.  Experience  with  benchmark  issues  and  development  of \ndealer communities and knowledgeable investors provide a useful base for issue and trading of \ncorporate as well as subnational debt. The Government has issued decrees guiding issuance of \ncorporate bonds, including issuance of debt by equitized enterprises. Over time, promoting \ncorporate and subnational debt issuance will require growth of credit-rating and bond-pricing \nservices in the market, although currently the market is too small to viably sustain such entities. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  the  Government  in  establishing  a  framework  for  promoting \ndevelopment of an independent credit-rating agency and an independent bond-pricing agency.  \n \n68.  Development of the leasing sector, supported by FSPL III, will result in evolution of \nfinancially strong leasing companies that can contribute to and gain from issuing debt for both \nshort and long term. Leasing companies that are subsidiaries of SOCBs currently source all or \nmost of their funds from their respective parent banks; SBV has imposed a prudential ceiling on \n                                                 \n24  During the first 9 months of 2006, SBV made foreign exchange reserve purchases of $2.9 billion and at end of \nSeptember 2006 foreign exchange reserves amounted to $12.1 billion. Each purchase of foreign exchange by SBV \nresults in the creation of an equivalent amount of dong liquidity. To eliminate the inflationary implications from this \ndong liquidity arising from the inflow of foreign exchange, that is to sterilize these inflows, SBV should have issued \nan equivalent amount of additional securities, namely D46 trillion up to September 2006. However the outstanding \namounts of SBV bills and treasury bills during 2006 rose by at most D10 trillion. As such the liquidity of the system \nhad increased substantially. Until the end of 2005, overnight interbank rates and treasury-bill rates were roughly \naligned with one another at about 6% but since then, with increased liquidity, the treasury-bill rates declined to less \nthan 4% while the interbank overnight rates were at or above 6%. See Dickie, P. 2007. Foreign Capital Inflows to \nViet Nam, mimeo, Victoria University and Southeast Asia Department, ADB, Manila.  \n ", "21 \nthis access in terms of 10% of paid-up capital of the parent bank. However, SBV will need to \nreview the prudential requirements as leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term \nloans of more than 1 year at viable interest rates, and relatively few have been successful in \nissuing medium- or long-term debentures. Leasing is a still a new product in Viet Nam, and \nawareness of its special security features is limited. The ability to swiftly enforce ownership \nrights  through  a  summary  process  is  key  to  growth  of  the  industry,  particularly  self-help \nrepossession of leased equipment in cases of contract default. This right is already included in \ncurrent legislation, but has been difficult to enforce due to the relative novelty of the industry. \nImplementing rules and regulations may need to be refined further to improve enforcement of \nlease contracts in cases of default. At the same time, raising public awareness of the rights and \nobligations established under a lease contract and enhancing technical knowledge of leasing \ncontracts  among  judges  in  economic  courts  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  will  be \nimportant to developing the industry. FSPL III support for the leasing sector will complement \ninvestment lending by ADB to support selected leasing companies in Viet Nam.25 \n \n3.  Strengthened Investor and Consumer Protection \na.  Improve Investor Protection \n69.  Adopting IOSCO Standards. The new Securities Law adopted by the Government and \neffective from January 2007 is consistent with international best practice (IOSCO standards) for \nprotecting the lawful rights and interests of investors. Section 28 of the law provides MOF with \nthe power to adopt corporate governance principles for companies traded on the STCs. To \naddress the potential for insider trading, the law contains a short swing profit prohibition against \ninsiders (members of management, general director, deputy general director, financial manager, \naccountant, and other management officers) who are prohibited from buying and selling shares \nof that public company within a 6-month period. Under Section 31, shareholders can recover \nprofits gained from these transactions, which are deemed illegal. The law contains provisions to \nprotect shareholders during a takeover (defined as the offer to buy voting shares resulting in \nownership of 25% or more of a public company\u2019s outstanding shares). The new law also has \nprovisions for securities firms for enhancing investor protection.26 \n \n70.  Strengthening  Surveillance  and  Enforcement.  The challenge now is to maximize \nsound implementation of the new framework for investor protection by a strong and effective \nmarket regulator. FSPL III has supported SSC in developing and implementing a master plan for \nimproving its capabilities for market surveillance and monitoring. Under the new plan, SSC is \nundergoing  restructuring,  including  the  establishment  of  a  new  Department  of  Market \nSurveillance and Compliance. This newly-created department will need substantial capacity \nbuilding  and  training,  supported  by  ADB  TA,  and  will  need  to  develop  a  framework  for \nmonitoring STCs and clarifying their monitoring, surveillance, and enforcement activities. In \nstrengthening its role as regulator and promoting good market conduct to increase investor \n                                                 \n25  ADB is proposing a nonsovereign loan in 2007 to an SOCBs that is parent of a leasing company. \n26  Article 62 of the law requires the general director and staff in charge of securities dealing operations of a securities \ncompany to be certified as securities practitioners. To become a securities practitioner, candidates must hold a \nuniversity degree and have expertise in securities and securities markets, have passed an exam organized by \nSSC, and be employed by a securities company (foreign specialists in securities markets can also apply for the \nsecurities  practitioner  certificate  under  Article  79).  Licensing  applications  are  required  to  include  copies  of \nsecurities practitioner certificate and, under Article 71, securities companies are required to set up a system of \ninternal  control,  risk  management,  and  monitoring  to  prevent  conflict  of  interest  within  the  company  or  in \ntransactions with customers. Article 71 also sets requirements and prohibitions in line with best practice principles \nrelating to customer priority, segregation of customer funds, know your customer, and capital adequacy. \n ", "22   \nconfidence, SSC will adopt and implement a web-based system to facilitate the lodging of \ninvestor complaints, which will be monitored and addressed in line with current procedures. \n \n71.  To  strengthen  compliance,  the  Government  has  issued  a  decree  on  penalties  for \nadministrative  offences  under  the  new  Securities  Law.  SSC  is  promoting  transparency  by \npublishing  on  its  websites  all  cases  of  penalties  imposed  on  regulated  persons,  including \nidentification of parties sanctioned, sanctions imposed, amount and type of sanctions, and \ndescription of violations. This information will be made more user-friendly by consolidating and \ntabulating all information on cases and penalties imposed on regulated persons. After a period \nof implementation, subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support SSC in assessing its \nimplementation  of  the  IOSCO  principles  for  investor  protection,  in  undertaking  identified \nremedial actions including using information technology more effectively to monitor compliance, \nand in implementing a public awareness program as needed on investor rights.  \n \n72.  Deposit Insurance. To protect the rights and interests of small depositors in banking, \nADB supported Deposit Insurance of Viet Nam (DIV) in both FSPL I and II. DIV was established \nin June 2000, and has since grown significantly, including in its role in monitoring banking \nactivities supervised by SBV. FSPL III will continue ADB's involvement with deposit insurance \nand DIV by supporting drafting by SBV of a new decree on bankruptcy of credit institutions, \nincluding the role of DIV in the resolution process. \n \nb.  Strengthen Anti-Money-Laundering Regime \n73.  The Government recognizes the importance of combating money laundering and Viet \nNam has now become a member of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering.27 ADB has \nprovided  sustained  support  to  the  Government  on  strengthening  its  anti-money-laundering \nregime, and a financial intelligence unit, the Anti-Money Laundering Information Center (AMLIC) \nwas set up under FSPL II, which also promoted adoption of standard operating procedures for \nAMLIC.  FSPL  III  will  sustain  ADB's  deep  engagement  with  strengthening  the  anti-money-\nlaundering regime in Viet Nam by supporting further development and operationalization of \nAMLIC  through  strengthening  implementation  of  AMLIC  procedures  and  activities  by \nestablishing the prerequisite information technology system. The information technology system \nwill  be  used  to  collect,  process,  and  record  information  on  relevant  financial  transactions. \nFollowing approval of a feasibility study, AMLIC will establish the information technology system \nand also increase staff to effectively implement Decree 74 and its related regulations for anti-\nmoney-laundering. \n \n74.  FSPL III will also support continued efforts to enhance awareness of money-laundering \nactivities  in  the  economy  and  strengthen  guidelines  for  implementing  the  existing  legal \nframework. Under subprogram 2, AMLIC will coordinate with regulatory authorities to develop \nguidelines on transaction reporting requirements and needed internal procedures to strengthen \neffective supervision and implementation of anti-money-laundering regulations.  \n \nc.  Enhance Consumer Protection in Insurance Markets \n75.  The insurance industry has seen considerable growth and important achievements since \n2002,  including  a  legal  framework  specific  to  the  industry.  The  industry  has  witnessed \n                                                 \n27  Set up in 1997, the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering facilitates the adoption, implementation, and \nenforcement of internationally accepted anti-money-laundering standards as set out in the recommendations of the \nFinancial Actions Task Force. \n ", "23 \nimprovement in the expertise and effectiveness of the regulator, development of a pool of \nexperienced insurance professionals through training and education of staff of both insurance \ncompanies and the regulator, and increasing acceptance of good corporate governance on the \npart of the regulator and the insurance companies. Two important decrees (decrees 42 and 43) \nhave  been  replaced  by  new  decrees  45  and  46,  which  deal  with  all  practical  aspects  of \noperating insurance companies in Viet Nam, from license applications and market conduct to \nsolvency and reserving. The new decrees need to be supported by detailed circulars and \nregulations that have not yet been written. These will include a wide range of issues from \nstrengthening  prudential  regulations,  improving  the  quality  of  information  flows  between \nregulator and companies, and improving and promoting risk-based supervision. Two circulars, \ncirculars 98 and 99, need to be revised.  \n \n76.  To broaden their portfolio of products offered, which is currently adversely affected by \ntheir inability to acquire long-term assets in the capital markets, insurance companies are now \nproposing new investment-linked insurance products. FSPL III will support the Government in \ndeveloping and adopting new regulations on investment-linked products to address consumer \nprotection by regulating selling practices, fund accounting, reserving, and solvency related to \nthe  new  products.  As  the  industry  moves  further  towards  risk-based  capital-adequacy \nsupervision, the existing law on insurance will ultimately need to be amended to be better \naligned with evolving industry circumstances and requirements. Subprogram 2 will support such \nefforts as well as initiatives to establish more equitable treatment for foreign and domestic \ninsurance companies, particularly in the non-life-insurance sector. \n \nd.  Regulatory Coordination to Improve Market Oversight \n77.  As the financial sector in Viet Nam continues to grow in sophistication and become \nincreasingly market based, the Government will need to develop a comprehensive framework \nfor regulation and supervision. The financial industry is operating in a conglomerate form, while \nthe regulatory framework is based on entity regulation, whereby a particular regulatory agency \nsupervises only particular type(s) of institutions instead of particular types of functions. A more \nfunction-based approach to supervision is needed, as well as a shift to risk-based supervision \nmethods, and to adoption of common risk-based capital adequacy approaches that minimize the \npossibility of regulatory arbitrage. Vigilance is needed as (i) different types of intermediaries \nbegin to target the same market; and (ii) one type of intermediary (e.g., banks) begins to \ndevelop subsidiaries to enable it to serve different (e.g., securities) markets. The regulatory and \nsupervisory framework must allow both kinds of innovations to take place, but consolidated \nsupervision is needed to mitigate risks. A variety of institutional forms can be envisioned for \nconsolidated supervision, and the Government will need to assess possible choices. \n \n78.  FSPL  III  will  support  the  Government  in  improving  financial  markets  oversight  by \npromoting increased coordination among the existing financial sector regulators, adoption of \nrisk-based norms and supervision, and functional approach to supervision. The Government is \nconsidering developing a view on the appropriate structure of financial sector supervision, in \nterms  of  choosing  between  a  single  financial  sector  regulatory  authority  (as  in  the  United \nKingdom), or several independent specialist regulators, or another model that may be more \nappropriate for Viet Nam. The Government has issued a directive aimed at improving the \nstructure of financial markets' oversight and, with ADB technical assistance, will study the \ninstitutional framework and arrangements to strengthen cooperation and coordination between \nregulators to enhance financial sector supervision.  \n \n ", "24   \n4.  Improved Regional Cooperation in Securities Markets Regulation \n79.  Consistent with the objectives of the Government to expand cooperation with securities \nmarket  regulators  in  the  region  and  elsewhere,  Viet  Nam  entered  into  memorandums  of \nunderstanding with securities regulators in three countries in 2006: Malaysia, Singapore, and \nThailand. 28  This  will  enable  greater  exchange  of  information  between  the  regulators, \ncooperation in surveillance of cross-border activities, and cooperation in training and capacity \nbuilding. To expand SSC's capacity for better tracking of foreign capital inflows into domestic \ncapital  markets,  SSC  will  develop  regulation  and  guidelines  for  foreign  individuals  and \ninstitutions on investing and on providing services in securities markets in Viet Nam. \n \n80.  FSPL III will also support Viet Nam's participation in the IOSCO MMOU. The MMOU \nestablishes  an  international  benchmark  for  cooperation  and  information  sharing  among \nsecurities regulators. Prior to signing the MMOU, member regulators must establish through a \nfair and stringent process that they have the legal and regulatory capacity to fulfill the MMOU\u2019s \nterms and conditions. This process requires an extensive review of the potential legislative, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  obstacles  that  prevent  a  full  exchange  of  information  among \nsecurities regulatory agencies. Additionally, this exercise\u2014through its identification process\u2014is \nexpected to provide incentives for members to raise their respective national standards. SSC \nwill conduct an assessment of its ability to meet benchmarks under the IOSCO MMOU and \nidentify impediments. Subprogram 2 will support Viet Nam to become a signatory to Appendix B \nof the MMOU. \n \nC.  Important Features \n81.  FSPL III has a number of distinct features, starting with its strong alignment with the \nGovernment's  own  action  plan  for  development  of  the  securities  markets.  In  addition  to \nreinforcing Government ownership and commitment to FSPL III, this also reiterates ADB's role \nas a consistent development partner in promoting financial sector growth and development in \nthe country. Viet Nam's financial sector has been transforming at a rapid pace for a decade and, \nthrough its past and current financial sector programs, ADB continues an active role in both \npolicy dialogue and promotion of reforms.  \n \n82.  Second, the program cluster modality allows substantial flexibility to be built into the \ndesign,  while  also  acknowledging  the  importance  of  predictable  program  support  over  the \nmedium term. Recognizing that institutional change and market development are complex, time-\nconsuming, and nonlinear processes, the program design encompasses extreme vigilance to \nthe need for realistic targets achievable in the time frame of FSPL III. Subprogram 1 of the \ncluster supports policy actions that will seek to jump-start qualitative changes and processes to \nincrease coordination between different agencies and institutions. These may be particularly \nsusceptible in Viet Nam to plain institutional inertia and, possibly, vested interests. The impetus \nfor reforms would benefit substantially in such a context from invocation of external factors such \nas publicly announced policy commitments.29 Once initiated, the benefits of the institutional \nreforms are expected to be relatively easy to build upon by generating their own momentum. \nFollowing consultations with the Government, therefore, the program cluster adopts an eclectic \ndesign of a two-tranche subprogram 1 to be followed by a single-tranche subprogram 2. The \ntwo-tranche design of subprogram 1 is also motivated by the fact that the policy matrix for this \n                                                 \n28  A memorandum of understanding was signed with the Republic of Korea in 2002, and the PRC in 2005. \n29  Two other examples of such exogenous factors that are playing an important role in helping promote liberalization \nand reforms in Viet Nam are the bilateral trade agreement signed with the United States and the commitments \nmade by the Government under its accession to the WTO. \n ", "25 \nsubprogram can be viewed as consisting of three broad elements namely (i) improved levels of \ntransparency, disclosure, and information standards; (ii) enhanced investor protection; and (iii) \nimproved  issuance  framework  including  development  of  the  bond  markets.  The  first  two \ncomponents are front loaded within the program and are thus reflected in the first tranche policy \nactions that have already been completed, while the third component will need more time and is \nmore prominent in the second tranche actions of subprogram 1. \n \n83.  Aid  coordination  and  harmonization  is  also  furthered  by  FSPL  III,  which  effectively \ncomplements other aid programs to support the financial sector in Viet Nam. Activities of other \ndevelopment  partners,  summarized  in  Appendix  3,  are  primarily  centered  on  supporting \nbanking, and rural and microfinance. The World Bank in particular has provided two loans for \npayment systems and bank modernization to develop the national payment system and the core \nbanking systems of the largest banks; the second loan for $49 million is ongoing. It has also \nprovided TA to improve banking supervision, accelerate SOCB restructuring, and strengthen the \nregulatory framework in key areas such as asset classification and prudential norms for banks. \nThe World Bank is currently proposing a Financial Market Infrastructure Development project \nthat will complement FSPL III by supporting a comprehensive set of information technology \ninfrastructure for SSC, Insurance Department in MOF, and financial markets more generally. \n \n84.  FSPL III is classified as category C under ADB's environmental classification system, \nwith no significant adverse impact identified. It will not have any involuntary resettlement impact \nas it has no investment component. None of the policy actions associated with it will trigger any \nactivities related to indigenous people during implementation. Summary poverty reduction and \nsocial analysis of FSPL III is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n85.  The lending modality for FSPL III will be two back-to-back subprogram loans amounting \nto a total of $135 million equivalent. The Government has requested a loan of $75,000,000 \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 1 of the program \ncluster. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% during the amortization period, and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board.  The \nsubprogram 1 loan is expected to be utilized over 3 years and will be disbursed in two tranches: \na first tranche of $30,000,000 equivalent and a second tranche of $45,000,000 equivalent. An \nestimated $60,000,000 equivalent is expected to be needed to finance subprogram 2. \n \n86.  The overall loan size as well as tranching arrangements are determined by the strength \nof  the  associated  policy  actions,  their  development  impact,  the  importance  of  the  sectors \ncovered,  and  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government  as  indicated  by  MOF. \nAccording  to  MOF  budget  reports,  the  Government's  aggregate  financing  gap  for  2007  is \napproximately $3.47 billion, of which it will finance $2.64 billion through domestic borrowings \nand the remaining $830 million from external sources. The political costs of implementing the \nreforms are considerable, with vested interests benefiting from weak enforcement of regulations \nin financial markets and from the absence of adequate risk-management, supervision, and \ntransparency. Although the benefits of the reforms will far outweigh the costs, the benefits will \nmaterialize only over time, while the costs are front loaded. In the absence of timely reforms, the \nfinancial  sector  will  continue  to  be  ineffective  in  intermediating  resources  efficiently  into \ninvestments, the financial sector and the economy will be vulnerable to systemic risks, perhaps \nmost importantly currency and maturity mismatches, and investors will be left vulnerable to \nmarket misconduct and fraud. \n ", "26   \n \n87.  FSPL III implementation will imply some short-term, direct adjustment costs, including \nthe following costs: (i) restructuring and related capacity building for SSC and capital market \nSROs  (i.e.,  HaSTC,  HSTC,  and  VSD);  (ii)  operationalizing  new  institutions  (e.g.,  AMLIC);  \n(iii) establishing/upgrading market-related information technology infrastructure in supervisory \nagencies as well as SROs, which ADB and World Bank staff estimates place at approximately \n$30 million (a part of which may be covered by a proposed World Bank loan developed in \nconsultation with ADB (para. 83)); and (iv) strengthening the accounting and auditing regime \nincluding the development of capacity in supervisory authorities and SROs, introduction of new \nstandards, and consolidation and strengthening of the legislative and regulatory framework. The \nshort-term, direct costs however do not incorporate the full impact of the policy package, which \nincludes longer-term changes at the level of institutions and processes. \n \n88.  Each subprogram will be processed sequentially, with subprogram 2 to be processed \nupon completion of subprogram 1. Subprogram 1 has two tranches and is expected to be \ncompleted  14  months  after  loan  effectiveness.  Subprogram  2  will  be  presented  for  Board \nconsideration and approval based on the progress achieved in implementing subprogram 1, and \nthe readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding policy reform measures. The \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 will be within 36 months from subprogram 1 loan \neffectiveness.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n89.  SBV  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  MOF,  including  SSC,  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency. SBV will be responsible for overall program implementation, including administration \nand  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and  preparation  of \nsemiannual progress reports on program implementation.  \n \n90.  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  different  Government  ministries  and \nagencies concerned, a program steering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by \nSBV, will comprise senior officers from all government agencies concerned, including SBV and \nMOF, which includes SSC. The PSC will meet on a semiannual and ad hoc (when necessary) \nbasis to review pending issues and propose concrete actions for their resolution to ensure \ntimely program implementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will be formed \nwithin SBV, headed by a senior SBV officer, to assist the PSC and ADB, and have responsibility \nfor day-to-day program implementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n91.  The implementation period for the program cluster is from January 2006 to September \n2010. Subprogram 1 consists of tranche 1 (January 2006 to September 2007) and tranche 2 \n(October 2007 to February 2009) actions. All actions included in tranche 1 were completed by \n30 September 2007. Subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented during March 2009 to \nSeptember 2010. \n \n ", "27 \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n92.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,30 goods and services produced in and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with standard \npublic procedures in Viet Nam, and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to \nADB. In the case of goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets, they will \nbe procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. \n \n93.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 6) and subject to expenditures not being incurred more than \n180  days  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of \ncertification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the loan proceeds \nare expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official  development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. \nFSPL III recognizes policy measures and relevant eligible costs already undertaken by the \nGovernment prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n94.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  SBV.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to FSPL III. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to FSPL III. \n \n95.  The Government is taking an active approach against corruption, and recently adopted \nseveral  legal  changes,  including  the  Anti-Corruption  Law.  A  steering  committee  against \ncorruption has also been set up, headed by the Prime Minister. The committee, which has the \npower to suspend officials suspected of wrongdoing, is already engaged in several high-profile \ninvestigations whose findings will be made public. Results of investigations against corruption \noverseen  by  the  Government  Inspectorate  have  been  disclosed,  and  a  legal  framework \nestablished to protect and reward whistle-blowers against corruption. \n \n96.  Increased  transparency  and  focus  on  investor  and  consumer  protection  are  core \ncomponents of FSPL III that will contribute to lowering corruption in the financial sector and \ncapital markets. Introduction of improved standards of disclosure and quality of accounting and \nauditing  services  will  increase  transparency  against  corruption.  In  addition,  FSPL  III\u2019s \nanticorruption features include strengthening regulators to enhance surveillance and monitoring \nof securities markets, and increased coordination among regulatory agencies. \n \n97.  The  Government  has  made  progress  in  improving  its  management  of  public \nexpenditures. The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for the country was \nundertaken in 2000/01. A Public Expenditure Review \u2013 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-\n                                                 \n30  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "28   \nIFA) was subsequently conducted in 2004, which updated and reviewed implementation of the \nrecommendations of the 2001 CFAA, and also suggested reforms in other areas. Following \nthese, the National Assembly was empowered to ensure increased government accountability \nfor use of public resources, and to seek greater transparency from all agencies using budget \nresources, including SOEs, public investment projects, and statutory funds.  \n \n98.  The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management system are assessed as \nmoderate. ADB is participating with the World Bank, MOF, and other development partners in \npreparing an update of the Country Financial Accountability Assessment that commenced in \nApril 2007. The final report is expected at the end of 2007, and will provide an assessment of \npublic financial management by examining budget development, execution and accounting; \ninternal and external reporting; internal controls; internal and external auditing; monitoring and \nlegislative oversight and scrutiny; and financial accountability risks.  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n99.  The Government will prepare and provide progress reports on FSPL III implementation. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment's withdrawal application. \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review  \n100.  ADB will, in cooperation with SBV, carry out periodic reviews of progress with program \nimplementation, and assess the impact of FSPL III on the sector. The implementing TA to \nstrengthen  program  implementation  will  also  be  used  to  continue  consultations  with  the \nGovernment on the program cluster and the financial sector. The Government will keep ADB \ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave implications for program implementation, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n101.  The development of capital markets and a diversified financial sector will help mobilize \nresources and allocate them efficiently; the increased financial intermediation will help Viet Nam \nachieve and sustain its ambitious growth program. Well-developed capital markets will provide \ngovernment and private sector with access to medium- and long-term funds, thus enabling a \nwider variety of projects to be financed in the economy. They will also provide competition to \nbanking, thus contributing to increased efficiency of banking and of the financial sector as a \nwhole. Government debt market development will help the economy by providing a benchmark \nyield curve that can help pricing of other, riskier assets, and contribute to development of \nmarkets  for  other  assets.  Successful  development  of  debt  markets will  also  help  increase \neffectiveness of the monetary policy and facilitate improved monetary policy  management. \nIncreased investor protection in securities markets will benefit large as well as small investors, \nand provide households with mechanisms to invest savings safely. Stronger protection for \nconsumers in insurance will benefit all consumers, while enabling new insurance products to be \nintroduced  to  the  market.  Development  of  the  leasing  sector  will  provide  access  of  firms, \nincluding small- and medium-sized firms, to alternative sources of financing for their capital \nrequirement.  \n \n ", "29 \n102.  FSPL III will also have the benefit of contributing to improved institutional coordination in \nthe economy, particularly between MOF and SBV, as also between various regulatory agencies \ninvolved in supervising the financial sector. The emphasis of FSPL III on creation and large-\nscale,  web-based  dissemination  of  information  across  the  financial  markets  is  another \nsignificant aspect of institutional change, given the historical context of Viet Nam as an economy \nin  transition.  By  encouraging  a  movement  away  from  hoarding  data  on  presumption  of \nsensitivity, the implementation of FSPL III will help contribute to institutionalizing enhanced data \nand information availability, and transparency across other markets and sectors of the economy, \nas well as government agencies. Equally, the benefits of FSPL III will be spread across all \nsectors  of  the  economy,  given  the  role  of  the  financial  sector  in  modern  market-based \neconomies. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n103.  FSPL III assumes political stability in the country, and continued adoption of sound \nmacroeconomic policies by the Government. Given the track record of Viet Nam, both these \nassumptions are sound and defensible. Nonetheless, program implementation is still subject to \nthe following potential risks: \n \n(i)  Exogenous regional financial shock. The first risk is the possibility of a large \nexogenous  shock  in  the  form  of  a  regional  financial  crisis.  The  economy  is \nbenefiting from its growing integration with global trade and financial flows, but \nthis also leaves it more vulnerable to such shocks. However, the region as a \nwhole has rebounded successfully from the last crisis, whose 10th anniversary \non July 2 this year saw stock markets soaring across the region, and high rates \nof export and GDP growth. Concerns at this stage are not regional per se but \nmore  related  to  global  imbalances  in  savings  between  Asian  countries  and \nothers, and spillover effects from the crisis in markets for subprime mortgage \nlending. Viet Nam, for its part, has a very sound external outlook with modest \ncurrent  account  deficits/surplus,  a  managed  float  of  the  Dong,  and  limited \nexternal  borrowing.  The  international  liquidity  crisis  that  evolved  from  the \nmortgage  market  in  the  United  States  has  also  not  had  any  major  adverse \nimpacts on Viet Nam. \n(ii)  Equity market may have an unsustainable asset price bubble. A second \npotential risk relates to the rapid growth in Viet Nam's equity markets, and the \nlikelihood that an asset bubble has developed that may not be sustained. A \nrecent  calculation  estimated  the  price-earning  multiple  in  HSTC  as  45.2, \ncompared with 14.5 for Europe, 16 for Indonesia, 17.2 for the United States, 17.8 \nfor the Philippines, 18.1 for the PRC, 20.6 for Japan, and 23.6 for India. Even \ndiscounting for possible limitations in data quality, the concern of high price-\nearning multiples in the market is a concern. However, this has not deterred \ninvestors,  including  foreign  investors,  who  are  more  concerned  about  the \nappropriateness of valuations at initial public offerings (of SOEs) than the price-\nearning multiples per se. Nonetheless, SSC is quite aware of this risk and is \nseeking to increase investor awareness. Of course, minor market corrections, if \nany,  would  help  strengthen  program  implementation  by  underlining  the \nimportance of high transparency and investor protection in capital markets. \n(iii)  Political resistance and vested interests may slow reform. Implementation of \nprogram  initiatives  may  get  delayed  due  to  resistance  from  vested  interests \nopposed to the reforms. This risk is considered slight since the Government has \n ", "30   \nshown  immense  resolve  and  commitment  to  pursuing  the  reform  agenda, \nincluding  its  action  plan  for  development  of  securities  markets.  Government \ncommitment is also manifest in the scope of legal and regulatory changes it has \nalready implemented in the financial sector, as well as of proposed reforms for \nbanking and nonbanking financial subsectors. \n(iv)  Protectionist  backlash  against  liberalization  and  increased  foreign \ncompetition.  The  urgency  of  reforms  is  in  some  cases  associated  with \ncommitments made by the Government in the process of WTO accession; for \nexample,  liberalization  of  foreign  entry  into  banking  has  focused  energy  on \nreforming and strengthening state-owned banks and partially privatizing their \nownership. Similarly, entry into nonlife insurance will be substantially liberalized \nin 2008. If domestic firms are unable to withstand the competition, including in \nnonfinancial areas of the economy, such reform could face organized opposition \nand a slowdown or even reversal in some cases. However, the economy has \nbeen growing fast through the decade, and export growth is strong; the risk of \nperceived vulnerability to foreign competition appears low. \n(v)  Poor  governance  and  corruption.  This  could  erode  effectiveness  and \nimplementation of the reform initiatives. However, the Government is increasingly \nadopting a tougher stance against corruption and recently undertook several \nlegal reforms, including enactment of the Anti-Corruption Law, and setting up of a \nsteering  committee  against  corruption,  headed  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The \nGovernment  has  also  established  a  legal  framework  to  protect  and  reward \nwhistle-blowers against corruption. Specific components of the program will also \ncontribute to reduction of corruption (paras. 54, 70, 78). \n(vi)  Insufficient  technical  capacity  of  government  agencies.  The  last  risk \nconcerns technical capacities of SBV and MOF, including SSC, which as the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  managing  complex  institutional \nchange. However, the Government's record and ADB experience in the country \nsuggests that these constraints are substantially ameliorated given adequate \nsupport and technical assistance. To reduce this risk, extensive discussions have \nbeen undertaken with the relevant agencies and specific areas of assistance \nidentified. An ADB TA will be proposed early in 2008 to help strengthen program \nimplementation. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n104.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nand described in the development policy letter (including the policy matrix) will \ncontinue to be in effect. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded in FSPL III subprogram 1 and specified in the development policy letter \n(including  the  policy  matrix),  and  will  ensure  the  said  policies  and  actions \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of FSPL III. \n \n ", "31 \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n105.  The  disbursement  of  each  tranche  under  subprogram  1  is  subject  to  fulfillment  of \nspecified first and second tranche release conditions, as set out in the policy matrix. \n \nVII.

Perspective on Transition \n \n1.  Viet Nam's financial sector reform is ongoing. It has a history of almost two decades, \nemanating  from  a  simple  monobank  financial  system  where  the  central  bank  did  all  the \ncommercial banking in the economy, and capital markets were virtually nonexistent. The reform \nprocess also has a complex canvas, as would be expected for economic activities that involve \ntrading risky financial claims across time. The complexity is compounded by Viet Nam\u2019s later \narrival in the rapidly globalizing financial markets, even as the country's reformist ambitions \nencompass rapid integration into the global economy in its drive to reach industrialized country \nstatus by 2020.   \n \n2.  While  Viet  Nam's  financial  sector  transition  is  not  necessarily  sui  generis,  sharing \nsimilarities  with  developments  in  the  PRC  for  example,  a  long-term  view  provides  useful \nperspective. Table A1 below summarizes the various stages in financial sector reforms in Viet \nNam and identifies key issues. \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of Financial Reform Process and Direction \n \nPeriod  Reform Focus  Comments \n1986  The \"Doi-Moi\u201c reform process launched to   \nmove the centrally planned economy to a \nmultisector market economy \n  \nUp to first  Initiating development of private   \nhalf of 1990s  enterprise.

Viet Nam's economic transition since the late 1980s is characterized by cautious yet \npersistent reform initiatives, sequenced in terms of a focus initially on the needs of the domestic \nreal  sector,  followed  later  by  more  complex  financial  sector  reforms.  Financial  reforms  for \nbanking  started  in  the  mid-1990s,  at  the  same  time  as  development  of  capital  markets. \nHowever, the pace of reforms across the financial sector has picked up considerably during this \ndecade. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for financial sector development in Viet \nNam comprises long-term commitment through the finance sector program loans (FSPLs) and \nadvisory technical assistance with a focus initially on establishing the financial infrastructure and \nlegal and regulatory framework. \n \n4.  The  current  state  of  financial  sector  development  and  reform  indicates  continued \nmodernization  of  banking  and  a  transition  to  the  intermediate  stage  of  capital  market \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \ndevelopment in the medium term. By the end of the third FSPL (FSPL III), the capital markets \nare expected to be characterized by improved liquidity in key areas, extended product range, \nbeginnings of active secondary markets, expanded institutional demand through insurance and \npensions, increased domestic players including joint ventures, and enhanced transparency with \ndiminished regulatory interventions. \n \n5.  Over the longer term, Viet Nam needs to continue reforms to move to the mature stage \nof capital market development, with liquidity in many areas of the market, extended product \nrange  including  complex  derivatives  and  asset  backed  securities,  secondary  mortgages, \npresence of global players, and full transparency. In the process, the Government needs to \ndevelop a vision of a prospective structure of the financial sector over a longer term, and to \ndesign  an  appropriate  regulatory  and  supervisory  structure.  In  particular,  regulation  and \nsupervision need to be consolidated to remove any opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The \nfinancial industry is operating in a conglomerate form, while the regulatory framework has been \nbased on entity regulation, whereby a particular regulatory agency supervises only particular \ntypes of institutions instead of particular types of functions. For example, the State Securities \nCommission (SSC) regulates a brokerage subsidiary of a bank, but not the bank itself. Similarly, \ninsurance companies are regulated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and are planning to start \nissuing  investment-linked  products  similar  to  mutual  funds,  which  would  fall  under  the \njurisdiction of the securities regulator. With greater financial sophistication, different types of \nfinancial institutions may move into a specific type of financial activity, and regulation needs to \nbe  function  based.  Regulations  should  also  ensure  prudential  management,  governance, \ntransparent trade, and fair competition within and between different conglomerates. To increase \ncoordination  between  different  regulators,  the  Government  may  need  to  assess  choices \nbetween a unified regulatory agency and specialist agencies with coordinating mechanisms.  \n \nB.  Performance of the Sector \n \n6.  Viet Nam's financial sector has seen remarkable growth and transformation, but is still \nsmall and relatively underdeveloped in comparison to many economies in the region. Despite \nfinancial deepening in terms of higher levels of credit to gross domestic product (GDP) and \nbroad  money  or  M2  to  GDP  ratios,  banking  continues  to  be  dominated  by  state-owned \ncommercial banks (SOCBs); cash is still the dominant mode of transaction; and capital markets \nare  small  with  underdeveloped  regulatory  framework,  governance,  and  transparency.  The \nmarket capitalization as percent of GDP in 2007 is 35%, and less than all the other economies \nshown in Figure A2.1. Government debt outstanding in Viet Nam is less than a tenth of that in \nthe Philippines, while debt outstanding in Malaysia is more than 25 times that in Viet Nam.    \n \n7.  The  sector  continues  to  transform  and  grow,  with  the  Government  committed  to \ncomprehensive economic reforms, which have tended to be persistent albeit cautious. Financial \nsector reforms are now gathering momentum, driven in part by increasing interest of foreign \ninvestors and clear recognition by the Government that efficient financial intermediation is key to \nsustained high growth rates in the economy. Government commitment to real and substantive \nreforms in the financial sector is greatly reinforced by commitments already undertaken under \nagreements leading to Viet Nam's accession to the World Trade Organization.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \n  \nFigure A2.1: Market Capitalization and Debt Outstanding, March 2007 \n1400 200\n180\n1200\ns 160\non 1000 140\nbilli 800 110200 GDP\nbt $  460000 6800 %  \ne\nD 40\n200\n20\n0 0\nViet NamPhilippinesIndonesia Thailand Malaysia India PRC\nDebt Mkt Cap\n \nSource: CEIC Data Company and Asian Development Bank Database System. \n \n \n1.  Banking  \n8.  Starting  in  1989,  banking,  with  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV)  as  the  monobank \nconducting  both  central  and  commercial  banking,  was  changed  into  a  two-tier  system \ncomprising SBV and a system of credit institutions. The separation of central banking from \ncommercial banking led to the creation of SOCBs followed later by establishment of joint stock \nbanks; foreign banks were allowed to establish branches starting in 1994. The sector now \ncomprises 5 state-owned banks, 37 joint stock banks, 5 joint venture banks, 31 foreign banks \n(branch offices), and two development and policy banks. In addition, nonbank credit institutions \ninclude finance companies; financial leasing companies; and the People's Credit Fund, which \nfocuses primarily on rural areas and provides credit and deposit services with a limited scope. \n \n9.  The Law on Credit Institutions, adopted in 1998, provides the legal basis for operations \nof  both  local  and  foreign  credit  institutions,  and  provides  detailed  operating  guidance  to \nauthorized bodies. The law provides detailed stipulations on licensing and regulations for the \nbanking  businesses  such  as  refunding,  internal  audit  and  inspection,  SBV  supervision, \nprudential requirements, dissolution, bankruptcy, and liquidation. The law specifies powers and \nresponsibilities  of  credit  institutions  as  a  legal  basis  to  conduct  banking  operations.  The \nGovernment is planning to develop a new law on bankruptcy of credit institutions to refine the \nprocess of dissolution, bankruptcy, and liquidation of credit institutions. \n \n10.  Although the number of banks has increased and lending in the economy has grown at \n29% annually since 1998, banking is still overwhelmingly dominated by the SOCBs although the \nextent of SOCB dominance is declining marginally. The share of SOCBs in total lending was \n69% in 2005, down from 73% in 2001 and 83% in 1994. The SOCBs accounted for 72% of all \ndeposits in 2005. The transformation in banking is also reflected in the declining share of SOCB \nlending going to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as well as expanded scope of their operations \nin  undertaking  market-driven  lending.  The  SOCBs  have  diversified  lending  to  other  large \ncorporations, while joint stock banks cater mainly to small- and medium-sized enterprises and \nthe retail market. Nonperforming loans in the banking system are still high, although the exact \nmagnitude  is  not  obvious  due  to  existing  differences  between  the  Vietnamese  accounting \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \nstandards and international standards. Using the former, nonperforming assets account for less \nthan 5% of banking loans, while other estimates place the nonperforming share at 5%\u201310%. \n \n11.  The  Government  has  undertaken  several  measures  to  reform  banking  since  2001, \nparticularly focusing on addressing the issue of nonperforming loans, increasing the capital \nbase of the SOCBs, and improving the accounting standards for increased transparency of \nbanking financial statements. A credit information center was established to rate clients' credit \nrisk,  although  it  is  still  at  a  relatively  new  stage.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to \neliminating SBV ownership of the SOCBs through equitization. The fact that the SOCBs are \nseeking  strategic  foreign  investors  that  can  bring  in  technical  and  managerial  expertise  is \nencouraging. Financial consultants for the valuation of two SOCBs have already been hired and \nthe process for the others is ongoing. Two SOCBs are scheduled for equitization during 2007 \nand 2008, but on 10 July 2007, the Prime Minister directed Government officials to \"re-examine\" \nthe equitization plan of state-run enterprises in 2007, following a drop in price following an initial \npublic offer by Bao Viet, a large state-run insurance company. As a result, some of the large \nequitizations scheduled for 2007 may be delayed. \n \nFigure A2.2: Domestic Credit and Liquid Liabilities to GDP in Selected Countries \n \nDomestic Credit by the Banking Sector Liquid Liabilities (M3) as % of GDP\n200 160\n180\n140\n160\n120\n140 DP\nof GDP 120 e of G 100\npercentage  10800 percentag 6800\n60\n40\n40\n20\n20\n0\n0\n1993 19941995 19961997 1998 19992000 20012002 20032004 2005 1993199419951996199719981999200020012002200320042005\nCambodia East Asia and Pacific Cambodia East Asia and Pacific\nLow income Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic Low income Lao Peoples' Democratic Republic\nViet Nam Thailand Viet Nam Thailand  \nSource: World Development Indicators. \n \n \n \n12.  Foreign credit institutions are operating in the market as well (branches of foreign banks \nor  joint-venture  banks),  jointly  accounting  for  just  10%  of  banking  credit;  their  licensing \narrangements restrict the range of services they could otherwise provide. These barriers to \nentry are expected to be relaxed. Entry of foreign banks, as happened elsewhere in Asia, will \nhelp the sector's long-term development, but in the short term may cause increased competition \nto lend and hence lower credit-assessment standards in other banks. Indeed, even if wide \nreforms  in  banking  licensing  and  supervision  are  successful  in  improving  soundness  and \ncompetition, prudential supervision and surveillance institutions will need to continue playing a \n ", "  Appendix 2  41 \ncrucial role.1 Banking development is expected to continue, especially if boosted by the gradual \nliberalization of the business foreign banks can conduct.2 \n \n13.  The Government is considering developing a new law on the central bank to strengthen \nSBV\u2019s supervisory function by setting up of a separate supervisory department that will be \nheaded by a committee, and increase its operating autonomy. Currently, SBV is considered a \npart of the Government, which sets the annual targets; the SBV governor also sits on the \ncabinet. \n \n2.  Nonbank Financial Sector \n14.  In nonbanking services, insurance and leasing, although small, have grown quickly in \nrecent years. \n \na.  Insurance \n15.  The country currently has 8 licensed life insurers and 15 licensed nonlife insurers, with \nabout  half  the  business  going  to  Bao  Viet,  one  of  four  state-owned  companies.  Although \naccumulated insurance premiums are still below 2% of GDP, they have grown very fast in \nrecent years (at an annual average of 35.5% in 2003 and 18.5% in 2004, before slowing, Table \nA2.2). In 2006, life insurance premiums, in particular, only grew by 5.5%, whereas nonlife \ninsurance grew by a more significant 16.4% over the previous year.   \n \n16.  The commercial insurance industry was established in December 1994. The initial rapid \ngrowth  has  slowed  in  the  past  2  years.  In  2006,  total  gross  written  premiums  grew  to  \nD14.9 trillion ($930 million), a growth factor of 9.9% over the previous year. The rough split of \npremiums  received  is  life  insurance  premiums  57%  and nonlife insurance  premiums  43%. \nCommensurate with this activity, the insurance regulator has become increasingly educated and \nexperienced, and strengthened supervision and prudential regulations. A major task has just \nbeen completed: decrees 42 and 43 have been replaced with the new decrees 45 and 46. \nThese decrees deal in principle with all the practical aspects of operating insurance companies \nin Viet Nam, from license applications and market conduct to solvency and reserving. \n \nTable A2.2: Insurance Subsector in Viet Nam \nItem  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nGDP (D billion)  535.7 613.4 715.3 837.9  904.9\nGDP per Capita (D million)  6.72  7.58  8.72  10.08  10.89 \nGDP per Capita ($)  $439 $489 $559 $642  $680\nAnnual GDP per Capita Growth ($)  9.8% 12.8% 15.0% 15.6%  5.9%\nInsurance Premiums (D billion):           \nLife Insurance  4,616  6,575  7,711  8,044  8,483 \nNonlife Insurance  3,153  3,952  4,767  5,535  6,445 \n                                                 \n1  Viet Nam\u2019s banks suffer from low public confidence, regulatory and managerial weakness, high nonperforming \nloans, noncompliance with the Basel capital standards, and absence of international auditing. \n2  Initially, the regulation on foreign bank entry was restrictive. Licenses given for foreign bank branches were limited \nin time and these branches were required to have a minimum local capitalization of $15 million. These branches \nwere allowed to take dong deposits, but limited to $1.5 million. Foreign banks were also limited on their lending \namounts to a single project; this was progressively lifted afterward. On 1 October 1998, SBV harmonized these \nlimits across the sector imposing a rule that limited commercial banks, both foreign and domestic, to maximum \nloans to single customers equivalent to 15% of their registered capital (now clearly interpreted as actual capital). \nLarge foreign banks are balancing their strong interest in serving multinationals in Viet Nam and their frustration \nwith continuing restrictions on their activities. \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nTotal Direct Insurance  7,769 10,527 12,478 13,579  14,928\nAnnual Premium Growth  57.3% 35.5% 18.5% 8.8%  9.9%\nPremiums per Capita \u2013 D  96,667  130,120  152,087  162,350  179,600 \nPremiums per Capita \u2013 $  $6.31  $8.39  $9.75  $10.35  $11.22 \nPremiums/GDP  1.44% 1.72% 1.74% 1.62%  1.65%\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Insurance Department, Ministry of Finance, Viet Nam and Vinare. \n \n17.  In terms of nonlife insurance, Viet Nam has yet to establish equal opportunities for \ndomestic and foreign companies. Currently international insurers only represent around 5% of \nthe market. International insurers are restricted from insuring SOEs or Vietnamese nationals, as \nis reflected in the licensing agreement for international insurers. This is likely to change over the \nnext year or so, largely as a result of Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization: \nmost of the license restrictions are expected to be lifted in 2008. In terms of the life insurance \nsubsector, the mainstay product has been endowment insurance. In 2006, 87% of all new life \ninsurance premiums derived from the sale of these products. The industry is now actively \nexploring the design of investment-linked products that would need to be approved by the \nregulator. This approval depends on a regulation being written, which is estimated to take about \n12 months.  \n \n18.  These products do not represent traditional risk insurance, and need to be treated as \ninvestment products rather than insurance under international accounting standards (IFRS 4). \nInsurance companies have recently begun making long-term investments, and the authorities \nare now studying the introduction of investment trusts. Rapid changes are taking place in the \ninsurance subsector, which continues to thrive and become increasingly sophisticated. This puts \nincreasing  weight  on  the  role  of  the  regulator.  Effective  regulation  and  supervision  of  the \ninsurance industry will play a crucial role in promoting its primary role of effectively managing \nrisks for the economy, and its important byproduct of long-term savings mobilization. The latter \nis particularly relevant to life insurance markets. \n \n19.  Further development of the capacity of the wider insurance subsector to take on the \nrisks from the economy also depends on the availability of sound and liquid long-term fixed \ninterest and equity investment opportunities. At this stage of development, the development of \nliquid capital markets is perceived to be crucial. This needs to be accompanied by effective \nstrengthening of regulation and supervision to ensure a sound operating sector that protects \nand  keeps  the  confidence  of  policyholders.  The  new  decrees  45  and  46  will  need  to  be \nunderpinned with detailed circulars and regulations. A wide range of subject matter will need to \nbe covered, ranging from providing mechanisms for substantial market growth (a regulation \nauthorizing insurance companies to sell investment-linked policies), to strengthening prudential \nregulations, such as publishing and enforcing \u201cfit and proper\u201d requirements for directors and \nsenior managers of insurance companies. \n \nb.  Leasing \n20.  The leasing industry is another potential channel for financing investment, especially \nwhen leasing companies have access to long-term funding sources such as a liquid capital \nmarket. This access considerably expands the scope for growth as it makes the leasing industry \nless dependent on its own capital and on bank loans, which often constitute a prudential \nconcern. The advantages of leasing over alternative forms of finance, such as secured lending, \ncan be identified with lower working capital generation needs, simple security arrangements, \n ", "  Appendix 2  43 \nand a higher match of finance contract term with the economic life of financed equipment. Viet \nNam has 11 finance leasing companies: 3 are joint ventures and 5 are subsidiaries of SOCBs.  \n \n21.  Financial leasing operations are governed by Decree 16 (May 2001), as amended by \nDecree 65 (June 2005), Circular No. 8/2001 (September 2001) and Circular No. 6/2005 (June \n2005), both issued by SBV. The activities of financial leasing companies are confined to (i) \nfinancial leasing for machinery, equipment, vehicles, and other movable assets; (ii) advising \nclients on matters relating to financial leasing operations; and (ii) other services related to \nfinancial leasing. Preliminary market assessment indicates that the leasing market grew at an \nannual rate of 50% during 2002\u20132004, before slowing down to annual growth of 10% per annum \nduring  2005\u20132006.  Leased  assets  at  the  end  of  2006  are  estimated  at  about  \n$577 million. Leasing is still a new product, and enforcement of its special security features still \nneeds to be improved, in what seems to currently be the most pressing issue on the product \nside. Basically, the ability to swiftly enforce ownership rights through a summary process is \nimportant for leasing as a product to overcome the usual barriers that stall bank loans. The right \nof self-help repossession of leased equipment in cases of contract default is awarded in current \nlegislation, but has been difficult to enforce in Viet Nam due to its novelty. Several implementing \nrules and regulations may be necessary to make this key security feature clearer. Increasing \ngeneral public awareness of the rights and obligations established under a lease contract, and \nthe technical proficiency of judges in economic courts on this matter is crucial \n \n22.  Gaps in the legal framework still need to be closed and some of its aspects need \nstreamlining. Decree 65 permits sale and leaseback transactions and syndicated leasing, but \nimplementing  regulations  are  still  in  the  process  of  being  issued.  The  absence  of  these \nimplementing regulations constrains leasing companies from offering a wider product range \ntailored to enterprises\u2019 needs. These legal and institutional shortcomings do restrict product \ndevelopment activities. The other major constraint to growth of the leasing industry is funding. \n \n23.  Transactions  in  foreign  currency  are  subject  to  SBV\u2019s  foreign  exchange  control \nregulations.  Finance  leasing  companies  are  permitted  to  mobilize  financial  resources  from  \n(i) short-, medium-, and long-term borrowing from credit institutions in Viet Nam and abroad;  \n(ii) issuance of bonds with a term of more than 1 year (subject to SBV approval); and (iii) other \nmeans  as stipulated  in  Article  16  of  Decree  16.  In  addition,  long-term  funding  constraints \ndisproportionately bind leasing companies that are SOCB subsidiaries, because they source all \nor most of their funds from their respective parent banks, which are subject to prudential \nregulations. Thus, in general, leasing companies have cited difficulties in attracting term loans of \nmore than 1 year at viable interest rates, and relatively few have been successful in issuing \nmedium- or long-term debentures. Opening access of the finance leasing companies to a liquid \ncapital market (stock and debt exchange) would lift the most significant limitation on leasing \nindustry growth. Meeting the expectations of capital market investors in terms of information \nquality  and  public  disclosure  standards  would  also  trigger  considerable  upgrades  in \nmanagement quality. \n \nc.  Capital Markets \n24.  Securities  markets  were  initially  regulated  under  Decree  90  of  2003  (Decree \n90/2003/ND-CP of 12 August 2003 on functions, tasks, rights, and organizational structure of \nstate securities companies), Decree 144 of 2003 (Decree 144/2003/ND-CP of 28 November \n2003 on securities and securities markets) and Decree 66 of 2004 (Decree 66/2004/ND-CP of \n19 February 2004 on joining SSC into MOF. These decrees narrowly define securities markets \nin terms of institutions, activities, and products offered in the STCs. On 29 June 2006, the \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nGovernment adopted the new Securities Law (Law 70/2006/QHII), which became effective on  \n1 January 2007. The law expands SSC jurisdiction to include unlisted securities; clarifies public \noffering procedures; codifies the disclosure approach to regulation; and includes a framework \nfor  a  central  securities  depository,  investment  funds,  and  investment  advisory  and  self-\nregulatory organizations. \n \ni.  Stock Exchanges \n \n25.  The Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center (HSTC) was established in 2000, and \nthe  Hanoi  Securities  Trading  Center  (HaSTC)  in  2005.  They  were  created  primarily  as  a \nmechanism  to  equitize  the  large-pool  of  SOEs  in  need  of  fresh  capital  and  governance \nrenovation. Both exchanges started operating as nonbusiness units attached to SSC. HSTC \nstarted its operations with just five companies listed. By late 2004, it still only had 26 companies \nlisted with a total market capitalization of D3.8 trillion. All companies listed were former SOEs, \nwhich had issued public shares as part of the equitization program, before actually being listed. \nIn other words, very few companies had used the stock market as a platform for raising funds \nthrough an initial public offering. HaSTC was intended to serve SMEs. It was opened for listing \nof firms with at least D5 billion dong in chartered capital and 50 shareholders. In time this \nobjective was superseded by the goal of turning it into the main debt market exchange for the \ncountry. \n \n26.  With growing interest from international investors, both exchanges have grown rapidly, \nparticularly in 2006; the index for HSTC (VNINDEX) rose from 307.5 in 2005 to 751.8 at the end \nof 2006, an increase of 144%, while the index for HaSTC, which is much smaller, rose by 152% \nfrom 96.2 to 242.9. Total company listings at the two trading centers have increased four fold, \nfrom 44 to 193, between the end of 2005 and end of 2006. During the same period, total market \ncapitalization increased by almost 21 times (from D11 trillion to D231 trillion), or to 25.0% of \nGDP in 2006 compared with 1.3% at the end of 2005. The extent of market exuberance is \nevident from noting that the Government initially set a target for combined market capitalization \nof the two exchanges at 10% of GDP by 2010; this has already been significantly exceeded. \nThe country now has 55 securities firms and 18 fund management companies. The regulated \nequity markets are, however, still among the smallest in the region3 and substantially small \ncompared with the unregulated market for trading equity. The latter grew out of the ambitious \nequitization program of SOEs, only a few of which listed in the formal exchanges.  \n \nii.  Debt Exchanges \n \n27.  The underdevelopment of capital markets is particularly manifest in the markets for \ngovernment debt, and even more so for the corporate debt market. Outstanding bonds issued \nby the State Treasury, Vietnam Development Bank, and municipal governments totaled about \nD125 trillion at the start of 2007, which is an increase of almost 635% over the corresponding \nvalue for 2002.4 Nonetheless, the outstanding government debt represents only about 13% of \nGDP.  The  primary  market  for  government  securities  is  highly  segmented  due  to  multiple \nchannels of issue and methods. The State Treasury of MOF issues more than 100 issues per \nyear of dong-denominated treasury bills of 6-, 9-, and 12-month maturity, and bonds with \nmaturity of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 years through four channels. These are (i) treasury-bill auctions \n                                                 \n3  Market capitalization as percent of GDP in March 2007 was higher in all other countries in the region, e.g., \nIndonesia (37%), Thailand (65%), Philippines (124%), and Malaysia (180%). \n4  Compared with total outstanding debt of approximately $7.8 billion in Viet Nam, debt outstanding was $75 billion in \nPhilippines, $91 billion in Indonesia, $121 billion in Thailand, and $167 billion in Malaysia. \n ", "  Appendix 2  45 \nthrough SBV with SBV as the registrar; (ii) bond auctions through the STCs with SSC as the \nregistrar; (iii) underwriting through syndicates of designated banks and securities firms with \neach underwriter as the registrar; and (iv) direct placement or retails sales of bonds to the public \nthrough the national network of 600 offices of the State Treasury with each office as the \nregistrar. In addition, SBV issues its own short-term securities for liquidity management. Banks \nare  the  largest  investors  in  the  primary  debt  market,  while  insurance  companies  have  a \nsignificant presence in longer-term bonds.  \n \n28.  Although nearly three quarters of outstanding bonds are accounted for by 2- to 5-year \nnotes, the small volume with large number of issues and absence of benchmark issues reduces \nliquidity of any given issue. The primary debt market is characterized by more than 400 issues \nlisted on the STCs. Illiquidity of the issues is reflected in an undeveloped secondary market, \nwith most investors buying debt and holding it to maturity. The market for corporate debt is also \nquite rudimentary, with only four large companies having issued debt until the end of 2006 with \ntotal outstanding corporate debt of D9.6 trillion, or 8% of public debt (one firm has issued debt \nas of October 2007). Issuances of debt by subnational entities are also extremely limited, with \nonly three municipalities having issued debt to date, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  \n \n29.  Interbank transactions in the money markets are also still in the rudimentary stage of \ndevelopment, with banks more likely to transact with SBV than with one another. The SOCBs \nthat dominate the banking system, in terms of deposits, have been placing their excess liquidity \nat SBV through open market operations, at interest rates much lower (e.g., more than 350 basis \npoints in May 2007) than those prevailing in the interbank transactions among joint stock and \nother banks.  \n \nd.  Market Infrastructure: Accounting and Auditing \n30.  The accounting system, under development since 1996, is relatively young. Currently, \nthe legal framework for accounting and auditing is the Accounting Law, approved in 2003 and \neffective since January 2004. It has three implementing decrees: Decree 128 on public sector \naccounting, Decree 129 on corporate accounting, and Decree 185 on administrative penalties \nfor accounting violations. In addition, Decree 105 on independent auditing regulates auditing \nfirms  and  independent  auditors,  including  professional  qualification  and  certification.  As  of \nOctober 2007, MOF has issued 26 accounting standards and 37 auditing standards in line with \nthe IAS, but more will be needed, including for different financial instruments. Self-regulating \norganizations such as professional associations of accountants have a limited role in monitoring \nand maintaining standards in accounting and auditing practices \n \n31.  The accounting standards are being revamped to conform to the IAS, with 26 accounting \nstandards being created so far.5 A new general accounting system was adopted on 20 March \n2006, with MOF Decision 15/2006/QD-BTC. These are natural developments in consequence of \nthe very successfully backed open-door economic policies to attract foreign investment. With \nforeign companies now doing business in Viet Nam, internal institutional information practices \nwill be driven by the need for internationalization and standardization. Policy-making in this \ncontext  recognizes  the  importance  for  accounting  regulations  and  financial  statement \ndisclosures to steadily, albeit cautiously, adopt international standards. Customers, lenders, \nbankers, and investors increasingly require information that is truly transparent. Viet Nam\u2019s \n                                                 \n5  Viet Nam\u2019s accounting standards are based on selective adoption of international standards with adjustments being \nmade when the standards are not considered relevant to the current economic context or where local institutions \ncurrently lack the capacity for effective implementation. MOF has issued 26 accounting and 33 auditing standards. \n ", "46  Appendix 2 \naccounting methodology may no longer be appropriate for financial reporting, particularly when \ndealing with international suppliers, bankers, and financiers. Understanding the financial status \nand performance of a bank is difficult if only such historical cost-based accounting is available. \nAccounting practice for banks should be revised in favor of more market-price-based accounting \nfor bank investments, standardized practices in the allocation of expenses, classification of \nloans, and fixed-asset depreciation. \n \n32.  Both auditing and public disclosure requirements in the economy have substantially \nbeen raised in the last few years. All public companies have been required to publicly disclose \nannually audited financial statements. For listed companies, these requirements are coupled \nwith  additional  requirements  for  mid-year  disclosure  of  cash-flow  information.  One  recent \nupgrade in this framework requires all public companies to meet the same public disclosure \nrequirements as listed companies. Of course, the effectiveness of accounting and disclosure \nrules in sustaining a market economy is crucially dependent on the development of the country\u2019s \naccounting and auditing profession, and its capacity to respond to the needs. \n \n33.  The accounting and auditing profession, although still at an early stage of formation of its \ncertification process of certified public accountants (CPAs) and with limited effectiveness, has \ndisplayed  impressive  growth  in  the  past  5\u20136  years.  Together  with  the  country\u2019s  booming \neconomy, the profession has grown dramatically in the past 5 years with the number of auditing \nfirms increasing from 9 (4 international, 4 state-owned, 1 private) to 140. Auditing firms are \nrequired to have a minimum of three CPAs and fall into two main categories: (i) a dozen or so \nfirms licensed by MOF to provide services to listed companies based on meeting a set of \nthreshold criteria, and (ii) many smaller firms. Criteria to qualify for providing services to listed \ncompanies include minimum capital requirements (about $300,000), number of clients (30 or \nmore), number of CPAs (30 or more), and number of years in operation (3 or more). At least 12 \nfirms  have  more  than  12  CPA  employees.  These  larger  are  particularly  important  for  the \nfunctioning of capital markets due to high accounting and auditing requirements.6 Demand for \nrecent graduates is very high; they are employed as accounting technicians in firms immediately \nafter graduation. Many do pursue the certification process to become a CPA after the 5 years of \nrequired experience. The cost of certification is affordable (roughly $300), and professional \nperspectives are very attractive. The country now has more than 900 CPAs, with more than 100 \nnew CPAs passing the certification exam every year. The Government targets to have 1,500 by \n2010. Accounting and auditing firms can be formed by at least three CPAs.7 \n \n34.  Although quality and capacity differ significantly in the profession, the increased number \nof CPAs is a very important achievement. Also, mechanisms are now in place for (i) continuous \nand compulsory upgrade of skills and certification, and (ii) sanctioning of malpractice. As the \nVietnamese  Association  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  and  Auditors  is  strengthened  and \n                                                 \n6  All of the \u201cbig-4\u201d international accounting firms have a presence in Viet Nam and have played an important role in \nproviding services to the larger companies, and in providing the industry with a source of well-trained professionals \n(a number of the larger local auditing firms were founded by former big-4 staff). As accounting and auditing \nstandards grow in complexity, however, many of the smaller firms are finding that effectively responding to their \ncustomer needs is becoming increasingly difficulty, especially in areas that involve international best practice \nissues. This is exacerbated by the fact that many CPAs lack sufficient command of English to take advantage of \nbackground materials available to help clarify interpretation issues.  \n7  While the number of auditors has grown significantly, demands for their services exceed current capacity. The \ncurrent number of 900\u20131000 CPAs is expected to increase by about 50% in the next 3 years with some 150 new \nCPAs currently qualifying each year. Requirements for a CPA include a relevant university degree, 4\u20135 years of \nwork experience, and passage of the CPA examination. Continuing professional education is required. Foreign \nqualifications from selected countries are recognized and individuals possessing such credentials can practice \nprovided they pass the exam. \n ", "  Appendix 2  47 \nturned into a self-regulated organization, these mechanisms are expected to be more effective \nin raising the standards of professional practice. One such rule for example that will likely \nbecome more effective as a result of a stronger Vietnamese Associations of Chartered Public \nAccountants is the requirement for rotation of auditors dictated by Circular 64, Decree 105.8 \n \n35.  Supervision of the profession is done primarily through the firm rather than by individuals \n(CPAs can only practice through a firm) and auditing firms are required to annually reregister \nwith both MOF and Vietnam Association of CPAs. Quality control over auditing services is being \ntightened, and MOF and SSC have developed procedures for and begun implementation of \nregular  on-site  and  off-site  examinations  of  audit  firms.  The  legal  framework  for  auditing \ncurrently contained in a number of decrees and decisions is expected to be consolidated and \nstrengthened through enactment of a law on independent audit. The audit partner is required to \nrotate every 3 years. MOF is preparing and will shortly issue accounting guidelines for STCs, \nsecurities firms, and fund management companies. It is also planning to realign the accounting \nsystem for credit institutions with international norms, including the leasing subsector; and \nefforts are under way to adopt the concepts under IAS 32 (financial instruments: disclosure and \npresentation) and IAS 39 (financial instruments: recognition and measurement) in a phased \nmanner. \n \n36.  Further financial sector development to enhance capital markets is currently in early \nstages of development, with substantial illiquidity; limited range of products; a poor base of long-\nterm institutional investors comprising primarily insurance companies and domestic participant;, \nan underdeveloped infrastructure; and poor transparency and investor protection. Development \nof the capital markets will need to increase the supply of assets available in the markets, as well \nas deepen them by increasing the investor pool through increased investor and consumer \nprotection. In addition, the price discovery role of the markets will need to be enhanced by \nlowering information and trading costs, and improving transparency (Figure A2.3). \n \n                                                 \n8  Responsibility  for  regulation  and  supervision  of  the  profession  is  shared  between  MOF  and  the  Vietnam \nAssociation of CPAs (VACPA). MOF\u2019s Accounting Department is responsible for issuance of standards and \nregulations, while SSC has supervisory responsibility over auditing firms licensed to provide services to listed \ncompanies, and VACPA is responsible for supervision of other firms. VACPA is a relatively young organization  \n(2 years old) and is in the process of building its own capacity (it currently has 14 full-time staff in Ho Chi Minh City \nand 8 in Hanoi, in addition to 20 part-time staff). As international accounting and auditing standards grow in \ncomplexity, MOF and VACPA must ensure they have sufficient capacity to develop appropriate local standards and \nguidelines and effectively supervise their implementation. \n \n ", "48  Appendix 2 \n \nFigure A2.3: Development of Securities Markets in Viet Nam \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  49 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nBanking and Formal Credit  Capital Markets, Corporate  Rural and Microfinance \n(including SME and trade  Governance, and Nonbank \nfinance)  Financial Institutions \nA.

Growth, however, is not necessarily pro-poor and entails change, which the poor may \noften not be well-equipped to cope with. A well-governed financial sector that facilitates competition can \nhelp  make  growth  more  user\u2013friendly  by  (i)  improving  access  to  savings,  credit,  and  insurance \ninstruments, which enable the poor to cushion shocks as well as take advantage of opportunities created \nby change; and (ii) allowing for better terms on those instruments. \n \nA well-governed financial sector also reduces the likelihood and severity of financial and economic crises \nand consequently helps safeguard against a corresponding marked increase in the incidence of poverty. \nBalanced  financial  sector  development  can  promote  financial  system  stability  and  strengthening  by \nallowing risks to be more evenly spread among types of financial institutions and spurring competition \nbetween them. \n \n \nB.
