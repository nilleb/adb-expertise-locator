THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Strengthening Public Finance Management Program and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram \n1 of the Strengthening Public Finance Management Program. \n \n2.  The program will help the Government of the Lao PDR achieve fiscal consolidation and \nadvance public finance management (PFM) by (i) strengthening public debt management and \nreforming tax administration, (ii) improving medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting, and  \n(iii) enhancing governance and budget credibility. The program will support the government\u2019s \nVision to 2030 and Public Finance Development Strategy to 2025 (Strategy 2025), 1 and help the \ngovernment  realize  its  development  priorities  in  the  Eighth  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (NSEDP) 2016\u20132020.2 The program has been classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming and contributes to gender equality (operational priority 2) under Strategy 2030 of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). It will build the foundations for gender-responsive budgeting, \nincluding  gender  capacity  assessments  to  strengthen  organizational  structures  and  ensure \ngreater representation of gender stakeholders in key PFM reform structures. The program also \ncontributes to Strategy 2030 by strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational \npriority 6).3 The program addresses Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 by strengthening \ngovernance and inclusive institutions, and SDG 17 by enhancing domestic revenue mobilization \nand  building  capacity.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  \n2017\u20132020,4 and is included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for the Lao \nPDR.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The Lao PDR is currently one of the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia and \nhas made substantial progress towards graduating from least-developed country (LDC) status by \n2020. A resource boom and strong foreign direct investment in resource sectors resulted in robust \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP), which averaged 7.4% during 2010\u20132018. Gross national \nincome per capita reached $2,599 in 2018. Strong growth has alleviated poverty, and the Lao \nPDR\u2019s poverty rate declined from 27.6% in 2008 to 23.2% in 2013. The Lao PDR met the criteria \nfor graduation from LDC status for the first time in 2018.6 \n \n                                                \n1  Government of the Lao PDR. 2018.

If progress continues until the subsequent 2021 review, the Lao PDR will graduate \nfrom  LDC  status  in  2024,  following  a  3-year  implementation  period.  Further  information  can  be  found  at: \nhttp://www.la.undp.org/content/lao_pdr/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2018/3/19/lao-pdr_s-eligibility-for-grad-\nfrom-least-developed-countr/. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Despite strong economic performance, the Lao PDR\u2019s social development indicators have \nfallen well behind regional averages; inequality widened between 1993 and 2013, and the Gini \ncoefficient increased from 0.31 to 0.36. The Lao PDR is also increasingly vulnerable to revenue \nvolatility resulting from its dependence on natural resources with fluctuating commodity prices \nand exacerbated by weak tax administration. This has led to a growing fiscal deficit and high \npublic debt levels, which have increased the Lao PDR\u2019s exposure to macroeconomic shocks. This \ncould undermine sustainable financing of services and derail the country\u2019s poverty reduction and \ndevelopment goals under the Vision to 2030 (footnote 1).7 In addition, the Lao PDR\u2019s susceptibility \nto disasters triggered by natural hazards, such as drought and landslides, can also have a \ndevastating impact on an agrarian economy and hinder long-term growth prospects.8 To reduce \nthe Lao PDR\u2019s vulnerability to economic shocks, and to maintain growth and improve social \noutcomes, more must be done to strengthen PFM. The government has identified three primary \ndevelopment constraints: (i) lack of comprehensive debt management and tax reform strategies; \n(ii) absence of medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting; and (iii) weak governance and budget \noversight.9 \n  \n  \n \nFigure 1: Tax and Non-tax  Revenue (% of GDP)\n \n \n  16.2\n \n  16.0\n \n  15.8\n \n  16.1 16.1\n15.6\n \n \n15.4   15.5\n15.2  \n2010-2016 (average) 20 17 2018\n \nFigure 2: Fiscal Deficit (% of GDP)   Figure 3: Public and Publicly \n     Guaranteed Debt (% o f GDP)\n6  \n5.6 5.5\n5 5.1  100\n  4 4.3 4.4 56.2 57.9 57.7 58.5 55.8 57.2\n \n  3 3.2 2.8 50 45.8 45.6 45.4 46.2 49.6 51.4\n2\n  1.7\n  1 0.5 0\n  0 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n \n  Total External\n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and International Monetary Fund.  \n \n5.  Lack of comprehensive debt management and tax reform strategies. Government \ndebt has increased because of rising government expenditures and investments in large public \nprojects, amplified by declining tax and nontax revenues. The tax base is narrow, compliance is \nlow, tax administration is inefficient, and revenues are reliant on natural resources. Ineffective tax \nadministration has resulted in the Lao PDR ranking 155th out of 190 economies for paying taxes \n                                                \n7  IMF. 2019. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: 2019 Article IV Consultation. Washington, D.C; and Sector \nAssessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  In 2018, floods caused by heavy monsoon rain affected 15 provinces and Vientiane (the capital). \n9  These three development constraints are consolidated from the eight challenges of PFM reforms recognized in the \nVision to 2030 and Public Finance Development Strategy to 2025 (footnote 1). \n \n ", "3 \nin the 2019 Doing Business Indicators.10 Tax and nontax revenues declined from an average of \n16.1% in 2010\u20132016 and 16.1% in 2017 to 15.5% of GDP in 2018 (Figure 1).11 These factors \nincreased the fiscal deficit to 4.4% of GDP in 2018 from 3.0% in 2010\u20132016 (Figure 2), which is \none of the highest levels among the Lao PDR\u2019s regional and structural peers.12 The absence of a \ncomprehensive legal framework for effective debt management leaves the government lacking \nthe  necessary  tools  to  systematically  address  its  deteriorating  debt  situation  including  its \nincreasing risk from contingent liabilities.13 Outdated debt reporting systems and the absence of \nan integrated external and domestic debt framework contribute to a fragmented approach to debt \nmanagement practices, and public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt remains high at 57.2% of \nGDP in 2018 (Figure 3)\u2015a high level by frontier market standards.14 The external PPG debt, which \naccounted for 51.4% of GDP in 2018, is increasingly from bilateral creditors.15 As a result, the \n2019 debt sustainability analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed the Lao PDR \nat high risk for external debt distress (unchanged from the previous ratings in 2018).16 It also \nunderlines the country\u2019s high exposure to contingent liability risks, especially those related to \nstate-owned enterprises in the power sector.17 \n \n6.  Absence of medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting. The weak strategic link \nbetween  policy,  planning,  and  budgeting  undermines  overall fiscal  discipline  in  the  budget \nprocess. This  contributes  to  large  budget  deficits and  ineffective financing  of  development \npriorities, placing the achievement of the NSEDP priorities at risk.18 The Ministry of Finance (MOF) \ndoes not provide indicative budget ceilings to line ministries to guide their budget preparation \nprocess. The absence of a medium-term framework weakens the link between budget allocation \nand estimated funding needs at the line ministry level, causing budget unpredictability and weak \nbudget preparation and execution, and ultimately hampering public service delivery and poverty \nreduction objectives. Finally, the Lao PDR also attained low scores in the 2018 Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability Assessment for key PFM indicators, such as a multiyear perspective \nin  expenditure  budgeting  (rated  D),  and  orderliness  in  the  budget  preparation  process  \n(rated C+).19  \n \n7.  Weak governance and oversight of budget. This constraint relates to the government\u2019s \nefforts to effectively implement its PFM reform strategy and improve oversight. The State Budget \nLaw, revised in 2015, provides the legal and institutional framework for a budget preparation \nprocess and gives the MOF a strengthened mandate for negotiating budget allocations with line \nministries. However, much of the existing legislation has yet to be fully implemented because of \nthe lack of relevant regulations and the limited oversight of implementing agencies. In addition, \n                                                \n10 World Bank. Doing Business 2019: Training for Reform.

Coupled with weak capacity at the National Assembly, there is little meaningful \noversight of the annual budget. The core budget documents, such as the annual approved budget, \nquarterly fiscal reports, and public finance annual reports, are not accessible to the public. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n8.  Government reform program. In June 2016, the government launched the Eighth \nNSEDP  2016\u20132020  (footnote  2),  which  aims  to  pursue  continued  economic  growth  and \nmacroeconomic  stability,  while  reducing  the  poverty  rate  and  economic  vulnerability,  and \nimproving service delivery in health and education. The NSEDP focuses on the need for a \nmacroeconomic framework to provide information in a responsive, timely, and accurate manner. \nThe NSEDP also aims to improve revenue and expenditure management by strengthening \nrevenue collection and ensuring that expenditure management is in line with a financial plan \napproved by the National Assembly. Strategy 2025 (footnote 1) further articulates the need for a \nstrong, transparent, and modern public finance system in line with international standards. The \nstrategy includes goals and priorities in four areas: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability, \nincluding control of the budget deficit; (ii) maximizing revenue collection; (iii) developing a sound \nexpenditure policy in line with rationalizing spending; and (iv) prudent debt management. To \nimplement this, the government has developed the Implementation Plan for Public Finance \nManagement Reform, Step 1 (2018\u20132020) of Phase II (2018\u20132025) (PFM implementation plan) \nunder direct responsibility of the MOF and relevant line ministries.20 The government\u2019s fiscal \nconsolidation efforts are expected to gradually lower fiscal deficit from 4.4% of GDP in 2018 to \n4.3% of GDP in 2019, and 3.7% in 2020 (footnote 12). \n  \n9.  Programmatic  Approach.  The  program  employs  a  programmatic  approach,  which \nrecognizes the need for long-term engagement and strategic sequencing of policy actions to \nstrengthen PFM. A programmatic approach also enables ADB to align its support with the \ngovernment\u2019s PFM reform priorities over a medium- to long-term horizon. Strengthened PFM \nsystems, together with carefully managed fiscal policy, will support macroeconomic stability and \nensure that  public resources  are  efficiently  transformed  into  public  investments  and  social \nservices. The program includes two subprograms to be implemented over 2018\u20132021, covered \nby a medium-term results framework to ensure the long-term engagement necessary for PFM \nreforms. The program will focus on three key reform areas: (i) public debt management and tax \nreform, (ii) medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting, and (iii) budget governance and credibility \n(Appendix 4). Subprogram 1 consists of eight policy actions, all of which have been accomplished, \nand three of which are pertinent to gender mainstreaming. They are closely aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s PFM reform implementation plan (footnote 18). This will provide the foundation for \nthe ensuing, more targeted policy actions to push forward the three program reform areas in \nsubprogram 2. It will deepen the reforms further through support in the implementation phases of \nthe reform areas, including development of regulations and institutional strengthening. \n \n10.  Strengthening public debt management and tax reform. This reform area will improve \npublic debt management and revenue collections. It addresses the widening fiscal deficits without \ncompromising sound public spending to achieve the NSEDP goals, and ensures that financing \nconstraints do not lead to sharp reversals in fiscal policy. Under subprogram 1, there are three \npolicy actions. First, the MOF adopted the 2018 Public Debt Management Law to rationalize the \nuse of debt instruments and to cap the rise in public debts. The law, which became effective from \n                                                \n20 Government of the Lao PDR. 2018.

Vientiane. \n ", "5 \nAugust 2018, requires the National Assembly to approve all investment projects that exceed  \n$50 million. It also sets out provisions on the public debt management strategic plan, establishes \ndirect  borrowing  procedures,  defines  criteria  for  government  borrowing,  and  provides  the \nguidelines for government bond issuance. Moreover, the law aims to optimize debt management \nand gradually reduce the debt burden to 50% of GDP by 2025, and guide prudent spending \ndecisions in the medium term. The law also better defines the criteria and approval procedures \nfor infrastructure investments to ensure that future investments have high social returns and are \nclosely aligned to NSEDP objectives.21 Debt reporting and consolidation of domestic and external \ndebt have been further strengthened through an integrated approach. Under subprogram 2, the \nMOF will implement the Public Debt Management Law by establishing a fully functioning public \ndebt management unit, with a 30% female staff requirement and a clear regulatory framework.  \nThe Debt Management Unit will be strengthened to monitor potential fiscal risks and impacts of \ncontingent liabilities. \n \n11.  Second, the tax system has been strengthened and modernized through both tax policy \nand administrative measures. The government has finalized the drafts of new laws on tax \nadministration, income tax, and excise tax. Together, they will considerably strengthen tax policy \nand administration by addressing the need for a broader tax base and modernized tax system. \nAn organizational restructuring has placed local tax authorities under the MOF\u2019s Tax Department \nto improve revenue collection coordination and oversight between central and provincial levels \nand ensure that all revenues collected at the local level are returned to the consolidated fund. The \nTax Department has also established a Revenue Collection Division (responsible for large \ntaxpayers, who account for 40% of total tax revenues) to improve tax compliance by large \nbusinesses.  Third,  the  government  has  completed  the  Tax  Sector  Development  Plan  for  \n2018\u20132020 to reform the tax system by strengthening the legislative framework, improving \nrevenue collection, and enhancing institutional capacity. It has also incorporated a gender action \nplan to address priorities under its strategic goal to build staff and institutional capacity in the Tax \nDepartment.22 Under subprogram 2, the government will enact tax laws on tax administration, \nexcise taxes, and income taxes for improved transparency and compliance. The MOF will also \nconduct a social impact assessment of the new laws with an emphasis on impacts on small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (including those headed by women), and low-income families. The \npost-program partnership framework (PPPF) may include ADB support to deepen reforms in \npublic debt management by improving coordination with subnational governments for effective \npublic debt management and strengthening the capacity of relevant agencies to implement the \nnew tax laws. \n \n12.  Improving medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting. This reform area will enable \nthe government to finance its priorities and contain its fiscal deficit by effectively managing \nexpenditures and revenues over the medium term. With its PFM reform implementation plan, the \ngovernment has included a target for fiscal deficits of between 3\u20135% in 2020 and less than 3% \nby 2025 (footnote 18). Under subprogram 1, there are two policy actions. First, with support from \nthe  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization  Trust  Fund  administered  by  ADB,  the  government \nimplemented  medium-term  fiscal  planning,  which  determines  the  overall  envelopes  for \nexpenditures in line with a fiscally sustainable budget and greater predictability and transparency. \nThis policy action has improved the budget process and development outcomes through greater \nclarity of policy objectives, predictability in budget allocations, and transparency in the use of \n                                                \n21 The new projects need to have clear links to poverty reduction and/or disaster risk reduction. Infrastructure projects \nthat exceed $50 million will need to be presented to and approved by the National Assembly. A project approval \nmanual has been developed to streamline project submissions by line ministries. \n22 Government of the Lao PDR. Ministry of Finance, Tax Department. 2019. Gender Action Plan for Staff and \nInstitutional Capacity Building. Vientiane. \n ", "6 \nresources. The MOF strengthened its guidance to line ministries in the budget process by \nproviding a budget ceiling to ensure that overall fiscal deficit targets are met. A series of capacity \nbuilding  programs  on  gender-responsive  budgeting  have  been  provided  to  high-level  and \ntechnical  government  officials  in  the  MOF  and  relevant  line  ministries  to  foster  gender \nconsiderations in budget planning. Second, the MOF implemented tax and nontax revenue \nplanning to establish clear revenue targets and improve tax and nontax revenue administration. \nThe  revenue  planning  was  also  integrated  into  the  medium-term  fiscal  planning.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will align fiscal policy with the NSEDP goals by establishing a \nfiscal policy and budget statement to line ministries. This will provide fiscal and contingent liability \nrisk assessments and detailed budget ceilings to individual line ministries for the following budget \nyear,  plus  indicative  ceilings  for  two  additional  years  to  enable  line  ministries  to  prioritize \nexpenditures to maintain overall targets. The government will ensure public expenditures are \nefficiently allocated to priority NSEDP sectors (especially health and education) within the overall \nbudget ceilings to enable the government\u2019s long-term fiscal deficit target (reducing the budget \ndeficit to 2.5% by 2022) to be met. The PPPF may include ADB support on improving medium-\nterm expenditure planning and budget submissions among line ministries. \n \n13.  Enhancing governance and budget credibility. This reform area will foster governance, \ntransparency, and credibility of the government\u2019s PFM reform agenda and budgeting processes \nto ensure that public resources are effectively overseen and channeled towards realization of the \nNSEDP goals. Under subprogram 1, there are three policy actions. First, in March 2018, the \ngovernment operationalized its Strategy 2025 through the PFM implementation plan (footnote 18) \nto implement the six priority programs.23 This includes priority areas for (i) improving fiscal policy, \n(ii) developing a legal framework for the finance sector, (iii) reforming revenue management,  \n(iv)  strengthening  expenditure  management,  (v)  modernizing  PFM,  and  (vi)  improving  the \norganizational  structure  and  human  resource  development.  Second,  a  national  steering \ncommittee was appointed to ensure continuity and oversight of the PFM reform agenda in line \nwith  Strategy  2025,  with  representatives  from  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  the  National \nCommittee for Advancement of Women included in the implementation committee. Third, to \nimprove  transparency,  the  MOF  adopted  standards  in  line  with  the  International  Budget \nPartnership  and  published  core  budget  documents,24 particularly  the  Government  Finance \nStatistics Annual Reports for Fiscal Years 2015, 2016, 2017, and mid 2018 on revenues,  \nexpenditures, and revenue collection. Under subprogram 2, the MOF will strengthen budget \nplanning, preparation, and execution in compliance with the State Budget Law by establishing \nrelevant budget regulations and legal frameworks. The PPPF may include ADB support to the \nnext generation of the PFM reform agenda, including fiscal transparency and credibility. \n \n14.  ADB experience. ADB has been a key long-term reform partner in the Lao PDR, providing \nloans, grants, and technical assistance (TA) to support PFM reforms since the Public Finance \nManagement Strengthening Program was approved in 2005 (Figure 4). In 2005\u20132014, ADB \nfocused on selected areas of public expenditure management, including efficiency, planning and \nbudgeting, and accountability, to enable the government to successfully integrate national poverty \nreduction strategies into budgetary priorities and implementation.25 This support helped the \n                                                \n23 The government in July 2017 approved the Vision to 2030 and Public Finance Development Strategy to 2025 \n(footnote 1), which assigns the MOF to coordinate with line agencies for implementation of the comprehensive PFM \nreform. It also provides the road map for the second generation of PFM reforms and defines the government\u2019s \npriorities for strengthening its PFM systems. \n24 International Budget Partnership. 2010.

First,  long-term \nengagement is essential to push through complex public finance reforms in a weak capacity \nenvironment. The crosscutting nature of PFM reform programs requires a programmatic approach \nand policy sequencing to enable flexibility and responsiveness to the government\u2019s PFM reform \nagenda. Second, the leading role of the MOF in driving the PFM reform agenda and embedding \nkey planning processes as part of the core budget process is key. Previous ADB support \ndeveloped the necessary tools for the reforms, but may have underestimated the need for strong \nleadership and ownership by MOF of these reforms. This will be important for the Lao PDR to \nachieve fiscal consolidation. Finally, the program will benefit from strong coordination with ADB \nsector teams, such as health and education, to ensure that efficiency gains in PFM strengthen \nimplementation at the sector level. \n \nFigure 4: ADB Engagement with Public Finance Management Reform Agenda in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic \n   \n  2015\u20132019:\n  TA to bring in the \n2012\u20132014: medium-term budget \nTA supported the state  and public expenditure \naudit agencies for  planning \ngreater governance, \n \n2008\u20132011: transparency, and \n \nTA continued to foster  accountability\nefficiency and \naccountability of \nbudgeting and public \n \nexpenditures\n2013\u20132018:  2018\u20132021: Strengthening \nHealth Sector  Public Finance Managament \nGovernance Program  Subprograms 1\u20132 to support \n2010\u20132014: Governance and  Subprograms 1\u20132  the government\u2019s PFM reform \nCapacity Development in  (footnote 25) improved  agendas and implementation \nPublic Sector Management  efficiency of budget  strategies aligned with the \nSubprograms 1\u20132 (footnote  allocations to the health  Vision to 2030 and Public \n2005\u20132008:Initial  24) focused on PFM reforms  sectors and  Finance Development Strategy \nefforts to improve  targeting at governance,  achievements of health  to 2025 (footnote 1)\nfiscal planning  transparency, and capacity of  outcomes under MDGs \nand budgeting  MOF and relevant agencies and SDGs \nthrough TA\n \nMDG  =  Millennium  Development  Goal;  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance;  PFM  =  public  finance  management;  \nSDG = Sustainable Development Goal; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \nDemocratic Republic for Strengthening Public Financial Management.

ADB experience underlines that successful PFM reforms in the Lao \nPDR require a long-term, multipronged approach to developing sequenced and demand-driven \nreform agendas in line with government priorities. ADB engagement in the sector has prepared \nthe way for reforms and generated important lessons. The recent TA has strengthened planning \nby establishing a comprehensive revenue and fiscal planning tool to generate overall budget \nceilings and better use limited fiscal resources, consistent with a sustainable macroeconomic \nframework.28 This program will offer value addition to the Lao PDR\u2019s PFM reforms in two ways. \nFirst, the programmatic approach will enable ADB to both deepen its engagement in these PFM \nagendas and provide more comprehensive and systematic support that (i) builds on past ADB \nassistance and (ii) is aligned with the government\u2019s Strategy 2025 and the PFM implementation \nplan (footnote 18). More importantly, the program recognizes that successful PFM reforms require \nsustained efforts by the MOF to lead the complex reform process and coordinate with relevant \nministries and stakeholders. Therefore, through ADB\u2019s long-term engagement, the program is \ndesigned to foster leadership and ownership by the MOF of the reform agendas. This will help \nsustain the momentum of the reform process, thereby achieving more meaningful, sustainable \nreform outcomes. \n \n16.  Development partner coordination. The development partner coordination mechanism \nis well institutionalized and led by the government. It is embedded in the government-owned \nreform program, as articulated in Strategy 2025. The government leads development partner \ncoordination through the recently established PFM steering committee group. Development \npartners in the sector also meet on a quarterly basis to share progress in ongoing PFM reform \nareas. Close policy coordination and dialogue with the government and development partners will \ncontinue through participation in government-led coordination platforms. ADB has coordinated \nwith key development partners active in PFM reforms in the Lao PDR throughout the program \ndesign, including the European Union, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the IMF, and \nthe World Bank.29 ADB also coordinated with the IMF to assess fiscal outlook and risks and \ncontinued to monitor the public debt situation. The policy actions in the program are consistent \nwith IMF\u2019s 2019 Article IV Consultation assessment and recommendations for the Lao PDR. IMF \nhas provided guidance to the Lao PDR, under which the Lao PDR is expected to initiate fiscal \nreforms and expenditure rationalization. IMF is also providing technical assistance support, which \nfocuses on medium-term revenue strategy, customs reforms, and development of a unified chart \nof accounts for improved expenditure tracking. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n17.  Economic impacts of the program. The impact of the program is sustainable financing \nof public services for achieving the NSEDP goals (footnote 1). The effect of the program is PFM \nand fiscal position strengthened. The program supports the Lao PDR\u2019s capability to develop and \nimplement a clear fiscal strategy, grounded in a macroeconomic framework and closely aligned \nto its NSEDP priorities, in order to meet its fiscal deficit targets in the medium term. The program \nimpact assessment estimates the gross benefits from the policy actions in the three reform areas \nat approximately $4.5 billion accrued over a 10-year period.30 A significant proportion of the gross \nbenefits stem from efficiency gains from improved fiscal planning and governance of the budget \n                                                \n28 ADB. 2015.

Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n18.  The Government of the Lao PDR has requested a programmatic approach, comprising \ntwo subprograms and a concessional loan of $45 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto finance subprogram 1.31 The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; \nan interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. There is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. The indicative amount of the loan under subprogram 2 is $40 million. The loan \nsize is based on the Lao PDR\u2019s financing needs, the development impact of the policy actions, \nand development spending in conjunction with the reform. In 2019, the government\u2019s gross \nfinancing need is $811.65 million, equivalent to a projected budget deficit of 4.2% of GDP. To \nfinance the deficit, the government plans to raise $591.3 million from foreign financing including \nborrowings and grants. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  MOF  is  both  the  executing  and  implementing  agency  for  the  program  and  is \nresponsible for coordinating program-related reforms and driving reforms at the line ministry level. \nThe implementation period is from March 2018 to June 2019 for subprogram 1 and from July 2019 \nto March 2021 for subprogram 2. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n20.  Safeguards. Following evaluation of the policy actions, subprogram 1 is classified as \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Subprogram \n2 is also anticipated to be classified category C, which will be confirmed at a later stage. \n \n21.  Poverty and social. This program will help maintain macroeconomic stability, support \nprudent fiscal management, and help improve fiscal predictability through medium-term budgeting \nin key social and economic sectors. This will allow the government to gradually achieve a more \nfocused approach to budgeting for the social sectors, the SDGs, and its targeted poverty \nprograms, such as the Poverty Reduction Fund, to directly benefit the poor and vulnerable. This \nwill support the government\u2019s focus on poverty reduction by channeling resources into policy \npriorities, as reflected in the NSEDP and the Vision to 2030. Subprogram 1 is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming. The program has helped the government address the need to \nbuild a foundation for gender-responsive budgeting, undertake gender capacity assessments in \nstrengthening  organizational  structures,  and  ensure  greater  representation  of  gender \nstakeholders in key PFM reform structures. Improved PFM will ultimately improve service delivery \nand  access,  and thereby  benefit  the  poor,  women,  children,  and  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. Implementation of medium-term fiscal planning and budgeting will also allow the MOF \nto more systematically integrate gender concerns into their budget process.32 \n \n22.  Governance. The government has made gradual, consistent progress in improving the \nregulatory environment for developing PFM. Since the enactment of the 2006 State Budget Law, \n                                                \n31 Subprogram 3 may be added during processing of subprogram 2, subject to further discussion with the government. \n32 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nwhich was revised in 2015, PFM policies and reforms have focused on enhancing budget \ntransparency, developing a framework for medium-term planning, increasing the authority of the \nMOF in public finance and budget, and increasing budget stability. While more strengthening is \nneeded, ADB has reinforced this momentum with continuing support to improve governance, \naccountability, and predictability of fiscal and budget planning.33 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n23.  Risk and mitigation measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 The expected net benefits and impacts \nof the program are expected to outweigh the risks. Political resistance to the reform initiatives may \nretard progress on policy actions or full realization of the program benefits. However, the risks are \nmoderate because of the government\u2019s strong commitment to and ownership of the reform \nactions. The risks are also mitigated by ADB\u2019s TA, which targeted MOF\u2019s implementation of \nmedium-term fiscal planning and budgeting (footnote 32).  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n24.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Strengthening Public Finance Management \nProgram, and \n(ii)  the loan of $45,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for subprogram \n1 of the Strengthening Public Finance Management Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of  \n1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of  \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n3 September 2019 \n                                                \n33 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in  \nAppendix 2). \n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nPublic services for achieving the NSEDP goals sustainably financed (The Eighth National Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2016\u20132020).a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with \nResults Chain  Reporting  Risks \nTargets and Baselines \nMechanisms \nEffect of the  By March 2022 :    Changes in \nReform  a.
