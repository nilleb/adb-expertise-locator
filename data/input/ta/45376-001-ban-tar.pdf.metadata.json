The  Government  of  Bangladesh  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to support governance and capacity building to enhance the \noperational efficiency of the ADB Bangladesh portfolio. During the fact-finding mission in June \n2013, ADB and the government reached an agreement on all aspects of the TA including the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consulting services. The TA was included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for 2013\u20132015.1 The concept paper was approved by the director general of \nADB\u2019s South Asia Department on 24 June 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   The TA builds on the successful implementation of the completed TA for Knowledge \nManagement for Enhanced Operational Effectiveness and the ongoing TA for Governance and \nCapacity Development (to be completed by August 2013).3 These TA projects have contributed \nto the enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB\u2019s Bangladesh portfolio by providing training \nand  capacity  building  of  government  staff  in  the  fields  of  governance  (audit,  financial \nmanagement, project management, procurement, and recruitment, including cross-learning in \nthe  fields  of  audit  and  portfolio  management)  and  crosscutting  issues  (climate  change, \nemergency assistance, environmental and social safeguards, and gender). The TA projects also \nsupported the development of knowledge products. While implementing the TA projects, the \nstaff at ADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident Mission concluded that support needs to be available over \na longer period, be more targeted than general, and involve ADB staff as much as possible in \nthe capacity building and training activities. \n \n3.  Bangladesh continues to face major governance challenges. Weak governance and \ncorruption reduce the development impact of government investments and add to investors\u2019 \ncost of doing business. In line with the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan of \nADB,4 the governance risk assessment and risk management plan were prepared at both the \nnational and sector level as part of the country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2011\u20132015.5 The \nCPS notes that auditing capacity has been strengthened and performance auditing introduced; \nhowever,  despite  the  progress  made,  government  accounting  and  auditing  do  not  meet \ninternational standards, and updated standards need to be introduced and enforced. \n \n4.  The CPS further notes that public procurement standards have improved since the \nintroduction of the Public Procurement Regulations in 2003, the Public Procurement Act of 2006, \nand the Public Procurement Rules of 2008. Still, public procurement is the major source of \nfinancial irregularities and corruption in Bangladesh. Greater financial delegation and simplified \napproval processes are needed, as are intensive oversight and more effective accounting and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

The foregoing analyses, along with the tripartite portfolio review meetings (TPRMs) in \nAugust 2012 and March and July 2013 and the country portfolio review mission (CPRM) in \nNovember  2012,  identified  the  need  for  further  improvement  in  several  areas  to  enhance \ngovernance and portfolio performance and to strengthen results focus, risk management, and \naid effectiveness.6 These areas include (i) improving project readiness and promptness in the \ngovernment approval of new projects to reduce current start-up delays;7 (ii) reducing lengthy \nprocurement and recruitment approval processes to raise the disbursement ratio and reduce the \nlarge,  uncommitted,  and  undisbursed  balance  for  approved  projects;8 (iii)  enhancing  the \ncapacity and improving internal control mechanisms of the line ministries, executing agencies, \nand  auditing  agencies  in  the  areas  of  financial  and  performance  audits  and  financial \nmanagement to ensure timely and quality audits and financial management consistent with ADB \nrequirements;  and (iv) addressing  weak  implementation  capacity  related  to general  project \nmanagement, project administration, procurement and recruitment, and ADB safeguard and \ngender requirements through targeted intervention addressing proposed or ongoing projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The  impact  will  be  the  enhanced  operational  effectiveness  of  ADB\u2019s  Bangladesh \nportfolio. The outcome will be the satisfactory implementation of projects in full compliance with \nADB guidelines. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA has four outputs, namely, improved (i) capacity in procurement and governance \nin executing agencies and line ministries implementing ADB projects; (ii) readiness of ADB \nprojects; (iii) financial reporting and auditing of ADB projects; and (iv) results-based monitoring \nof ADB projects, sharing of best practices, and knowledge management. The identified risks \ninclude (i) political processes (general strikes, political stalemate, and unrest) disrupting or \ndelaying the delivery of results; and (ii) the government not providing adequate resources or \nadopting new tools and procedures in portfolio operations. No major turnover of trained staff is \nidentified as a key assumption to the success of the TA. The TA will be implemented across \nthree  dimensions:  strengthening  implementation  capacity,  project  preparatory  capacities \n(readiness), and governance. The proposed methodology described in para. 8\u201313 below will \nensure that available TA resources are used in the most efficient and targeted way, and that \nthere is synergy among consulting outputs. \n \n8.  Implementation capacity. The TA will support CPRMs and TPRMs, which are both \ngood platforms for discussion, knowledge sharing, and cross-learning on operational issues. \nThe TA will also support (i) procurement clinics for executing agency staff; (ii) the introduction \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Portfolio Review Mission, Aide Memoire. Dhaka; ADB. 2012 and 2013. Tripartite Portfolio \nReview Meetings, Memorandums of Understandings. Dhaka. \n7  A recent study conducted by ADB under TA 7928 (presented in the Final Report of International Public Sector \nPlanning Consultant, June 2013, Dhaka) has estimated that for ADB projects approved in 2010\u20132012, the average \ntime taken to approve a development project proposal was about 200 days.  \n8  As of 31 July 2013, the uncontracted balance of the $5.24 billion loan and grant portfolio in Bangladesh is $3.08 \nbillion (59%) and the undisbursed balance is $3.37 billion (64%).  \n ", "  3\nand implementation of electronic government procurement in ADB-funded projects to the extent \napproved  by  ADB;  and  (iii)  open  days  for  contractors  and  consultants,  which  will  present \nupcoming business opportunities under ADB projects, best practices, lessons learned, ADB \nprocurement and recruitment procedures, and discuss specific questions and concerns from the \ncontractors and consultants industry. The open days will encourage increased participation and \ncompetition in bidding processes and improved quality of bids, reducing instances of rebidding \n(resulting in fewer delays in procurement and recruitment) and improving the quality of delivered \ngoods, civil works, and consulting services.  \n \n9.  The TA  will  continue  the  capacity  development  program  started  under  the  recently \ncompleted and ongoing TA projects (footnote 5) in the fields of governance (audit, financial \nmanagement, portfolio management, procurement, and recruitment) and crosscutting issues \n(climate change, environmental and social safeguards, and gender). It will also support general \nproject  management,  project  administration,  and  results-based  management,  including \nmonitoring and evaluation training. Resource persons and consultants will collate the outcomes \nof learning events for broader dissemination and prepare knowledge products for future use. \nThe capacity building program under the TA will be managed to ensure that all government staff \nimplementing ADB projects are included, and that training activities are thoroughly prepared in \nconsultation with the government, and planned well in advance to ensure good participation. To \nthis end, the resident mission will prepare longer-term and quarterly capacity building programs \nto be published and updated regularly. The developed training modules will be kept for future \nuse.  Experiences from the  implementation  of the  aforementioned TA projects  confirm that \ncapacity building and training should be targeted interventions addressing both staff of ongoing \nprojects and staff involved in the early stages of project processing. Impact of broad-based \ntraining of government staff is short-term. To enhance skills and harness them for immediate \npractical use, the TA will combine targeted training sessions with on-the-job training. Further, \nbased on the lessons learned, training will make use of qualified government staff and ADB staff \nas resource persons.  \n \n10.  Project administration experiences reveal insufficient knowledge in the government both \nabout ADB policies and guidelines; and government regulations and policies related to project \nadministration, financial management and accounting, audit, procurement and recruitment, and \nsafeguard and gender. Further, the slow incorporation of lessons learned and the slow adoption \nof best practices from past project implementation are recurrent issues. These issues will be \naddressed mainly through a capacity building program (para. 8\u20139) but also by (i) developing, \npublishing and disseminating knowledge products and tools, including completion reports of \nhighly successful or failed projects and TA projects, highlights of the learning events where staff \nparticipated,  tools  to  support  review  of  bid  evaluation  reports  and  annual  project  financial \nstatements; (ii) conducting random procurement audits as part of missions; (iii) supporting \npublications and knowledge events including the learning event \u201c40 Years of Bangladesh\u2013ADB \nCooperation\u201d in 2013 and regional cross-learning events and government staff training events in \nthe region and at ADB headquarters, and (iv) the systematic preparation and use of training \nmodules. An increased use of materials written in Bangla that includes both ADB requirements \nand government regulations and policies will enhance the outcome.  \n \n11.  Project readiness. The lack of project readiness and effectiveness is causing startup \ndelays in project implementation.9 The TA will support the implementation of the actions agreed \nupon during the November 2012 CPRM and the March and July 2013 TPRMs to improve \n                                                \n9  Time from approval to 10% disbursement is 25 months on average in Bangladesh. The acceptable time from \napproval to effectiveness is set at 6 months. \n ", "4  \nproject readiness, including (i) training government staff and providing support in the preparation \nof government project approval documents to ensure that they are completed at the project \npreparatory stage; (ii) monitoring the effective implementation of agreed project readiness filters \nto  better  address  critical  issues  causing  startup  delays,  and  supporting  necessary  policy \ndialogue  with  facts  and  data;  (iii)  monitoring  the  full  implementation  of  the  \u201cno  objection\u201d \nprocedure for the confirmation of the TA letter; and (iv) providing support for policy dialogue to (a) \nintroduce fast-track procedures for government approval of projects, (b) increase line ministry \nproject approval thresholds, (c) increase line ministry approval thresholds for procurement of \ngoods and works and recruitment of consultants, and (d) promote and monitor the reduction in \nnumber of contract packages by enlarging the contract size where feasible. \n \n12.  Governance. The TA will address the needs identified by ADB and the government for \nbetter  governance  and  internal  control  mechanisms  in  the  areas  of  internal  financial  and \nprocurement audits, financial management, procurement of goods and civil works, recruitment \nof consultants, and contract administration. This will be done through training and participation \nof government counterparts in national and regional conferences, seminars, procurement clinics, \nand ADB open days for contractors and consultants. The activities will support the capacity \nenhancement of executing agencies, line ministries, local government institutions, the Planning \nCommission,  the  Foreign  Aided  Projects  Audit  Directorate  (FAPAD),  and  the  Economic \nRelations Division (ERD). Further, the feedback from ADB review missions, ADB Operations \nServices and Financial Management Department, and ADB Office of Anticorruption and Integrity \nwill be used both as input for the training and for preparing related knowledge products. The \nexperience from the implemented training and capacity building has confirmed the importance \nof comparing ADB policies and procedures with the corresponding government regulations and \npolicies to better understand commonalities and differences, making training targeted to the \nstaff involved, and conducting training in the early phase of projects.  \n \n13.  The TA will support (i) the FAPAD and the Central Procurement Technical Unit to further \ndevelop  governance  tools;  (ii)  line  ministries  and  executing  agencies  to  enhance  the \nmanagement  and  monitoring  of  audits,  the  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works,  the \nrecruitment of consultants, and contract administration; and (iii) ADB project officers to provide a \nsustainable oversight and monitoring base with the use of the tools developed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $460,000, of which $400,000 equivalent will be financed on \na grant basis from ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will \nprovide the remaining balance in kind, including data, meeting rooms and event venues, review \nof the recommendations and tools provided by the consultants, and adequate participation in \ntrainings, workshops and knowledge sessions under the TA. The cost estimate and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ERD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  ERD  and  the  ADB  resident  mission  will  jointly \nimplement the TA. Quarterly meetings chaired by ERD will be held to monitor progress and \nguide implementation. \n \n16.   The  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  international  and  national  individual  consultants  and \nresource persons (around 3 person-months of international and 18 person-months of national \nconsultant  inputs)  who  will  be  engaged  following  procedures  for  recruitment  of  individual \n ", "  5\nconsultants or resource persons as applicable on an as-needed basis for studies, training, or \ncapacity development. The consultants engaged under the TA will be recruited by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment will be procured using shopping procedures in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and will be turned over to the government \nafter completion of the TA. Consulting services will commence in August 2013 and continue on \nan intermittent basis until August 2015. More information on consulting services is in the outline \nterms of reference in Appendix 3. In addition, ADB staff will be involved in the delivery of the TA \nas resource persons. \n \n17.    ERD  will  nominate  government  staff  for  participation  in  the  activities,  for  ADB \nconsideration. The resident mission country director will be responsible for the endorsement and \napproval of activities. No objection of ERD will be obtained for the recruitment of consultants. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.   The  TA  outputs  will  be  spread  over  a  24-month  period  of  implementation,  from \n15 August 2013 to 15 August 2015. TA deliverables will be disseminated through quarterly \nreports; through briefs posted on the websites of the resident mission, executing agencies, line \nministries,  ERD;  the  ADB  South  Asia  Department  intranet;  and  through  sector-wise  local \nconsultative groups involving development partners. Some knowledge products may also be \ntranslated into the local language as appropriate for wider dissemination. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Capacity Building for Portfolio Management, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact       \nEnhanced  By end of 2017:    Risks \noperational  20% of completed sovereign  Project and TA  Political processes \neffectiveness of  operations (projects and TA)  completion reports  (general strikes, \nADB\u2019s Bangladesh  rated highly successful and    political stalemate, and \nportfolio   80% rated successful (2011\u2013 unrest) disrupt or delay \n2012 baselines: 9% and 91%,  the delivery of results \nrespectively)  \nOutcome       \nSatisfactory  By 2015:    Risks  \nimplementation of  90% of sovereign operations  eOperations data   Government does not  \nprojects in full  at implementation rated on    provide adequate \ncompliance with  track (2012 baseline: 85%)    resources or adopt new \n \nADB guidelines     tools and procedures in \neOperations data \nContract award and \nportfolio operations \n \ndisbursement ratios both \n \nreach 22% (2012 baseline: \n \n16.3% and 16.4%, \nrespectively) \nOutputs       \n1.
