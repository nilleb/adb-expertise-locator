In September 2011, the Government of the Philippines, through its Climate Change \nCommission (CCC), requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  conduct  pilot  studies  on  green  growth  and  climate  resilience  in  selected  critical \nwatersheds. The  objective  is  to  strengthen  institutional  and  technical capacity for  effective \nintegration of climate change concerns into development plans at the local government unit \n(LGU) level, which would yield multiple benefits in terms of environmental sustainability, job \ncreation, and long-term economic growth.  \n \n2.  In response, ADB mobilized $450,000 from its Climate Change Fund and initiated TA1 \non  19  November  2012  to  conduct  a  study  on  the  Upper  Marikina  River  Basin  Protected \nLandscape. The CCC requested further support to strengthen the capacity of at least three \nLGUs in each of three watersheds\u2014in the lower Marikina River basin, Camarines Sur, and \nDavao Oriental.2 A series of meetings took place from October 2012 to May 2013 between the \nCCC  and  ADB  to  discuss  the  proposed  TA.3 Consultations  with  stakeholders,  including \nrepresentatives from priority watersheds, were held during this period. ADB circulated a draft TA \nconcept paper for comment by government agencies and other stakeholders. Following a fact-\nfinding mission, and reflecting feedback from the Department of Finance and the National \nEconomic Development Authority, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the vice-\nchair of the CCC on 5 July 2013, agreeing to the core elements of the TA (impact, outcome, \noutputs, cost, financing, implementation arrangements, and consultant terms of reference). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The country is \nranked highest in the world in terms of vulnerability to tropical cyclones and third in terms of the \npopulation\u2019s exposure to floods and droughts.4 Increasing the climate resilience of the economy \nand  the  adaptive  capacity  of  the  populations  is  thus  crucial  for  sustainable  development. \nClimate-change-induced economic losses are expected to become particularly high in urban \nand peri-urban areas. The need to develop ecologically stable and economically resilient urban \nareas has been recognized, but the concept has not been widely demonstrated. \n \n4.  To address climate change, the government enacted the Climate Change Act of 2009 \n(Republic Act 9729) which established the CCC as the government\u2019s sole policy-making body \ntasked  with  coordinating, monitoring,  and  evaluating  programs  and  action  plans  related  to \nclimate change.5 The Climate Change Act provided the principles guiding the formulation of the \nNational  Climate  Change  Action  Plan,  2011\u20132028,  which  supports  gender-responsive  and \nrights-based sustainable development through seven strategic priorities: (i) food security, (ii) \nwater sufficiency, (iii) ecosystem and environmental stability, (iv) human security, (v) climate-\nsmart industries and services, (vi) sustainable energy, and (vii) capacity development.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Philippines for Climate Resilience and Green Growth in the Upper Marikina \nRiver Basin Protected Landscape: Demonstrating the Eco-town Framework. Manila (TA 8111). Because of the \ntiming, the TA has not yet produced significant findings that would affect the design of the proposed TA. \n2  The LGUs participating in the TA are Bombon, Calabanga, and Naga City in Camarines Sur; Baganga, Boston, and \nCateel in Davao Oriental; and Cainta, Marikina City, and Quezon City in the lower Marikina River basin. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 February 2013.  \n4  Climate Change Commission. 2010. National Framework Strategy on Climate Change, 2010\u20132022. Manila.  \n5  The Climate Change Act was subsequently amended by Republic Act 10174, known as the People\u2019s Survival Fund \nLaw, to make budgetary provision for climate-change-related activities of the government.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Pursuing green growth and climate resilience strategies through LGUs will address both \nthe causes and the consequences of climate change. Further, carbon intensity and resource \nefficiency are significant in determining the economic competitiveness of LGUs. However, the \ncapacity of LGUs to integrate climate change concerns into development planning is generally \nlimited. The proposed TA seeks to demonstrate climate-resilient green growth options in critical \nwatersheds in the lower Marikina River basin, Camarines Sur, and Davao Oriental. Priority is \ngiven to watersheds because of their role as water support systems for both upstream and \ndownstream communities such as domestic water consumers, irrigation water users, and hydro \npower companies. The watersheds are chosen based on their (i) high biophysical vulnerability \nto climate change, (ii) high levels of urban poverty and population density with settlements in \nvulnerable locations, and (iii) high demonstration potential for integrating climate resilience and \ngreen growth into local development at both policy and operational levels.  \n \n6.  The TA supports the implementation of the National Climate Change Action Plan and the \nClimate Change Act, which aims to integrate climate change and disaster risk reduction and \nmanagement (DRRM) into national, sector, and local development plans and programs. It has \nstrong links to the Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016, especially with regard to goal 3 \n(enhanced resilience of natural systems and improved adaptive capacities of communities to \ncope with environmental hazards including climate-related risks) of the strategic framework for \nconservation, protection, and rehabilitation of the environment and natural resources.6  \n \n7.  The TA has robust links to the ADB country partnership strategy, 2011\u201320167 and its \nthematic paper on climate change and DRRM, which recognizes the need to increase the \nresilience to climate change and disasters while harnessing opportunities for greenhouse gas \nmitigation. In addition to contributing to the objective of strengthening institutional capacity, the \nTA closely aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020;8 the Southeast Asia Department\u2019s climate change \nimplementation plan;9 ADB\u2019s Water for All policy; ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020; \nand various sector assessments, strategies, and road maps in terms of increasing resilience to \nclimate stresses (agriculture and natural resources sector), promoting the use of renewable \nenergy (energy sector), and enhancing water sanitation through effective waste management \n(water supply and other municipal infrastructure and services sector).  \n \n8.  The TA builds on vulnerability assessment methodologies developed under ADB-funded \nregional TA on adaptation10 and DRRM projects undertaken in Manila and other areas. It will \npromote synergies with ADB lending programs such as the Integrated Natural Resources and \nEnvironmental Management project,11 and benefit from other climate change projects funded by \ndevelopment partners12 in terms of exchange of data sets and information on good practices for \ngreen growth and climate resilience. \n                                                \n6  National Economic and Development Authority. 2011:  Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be enhanced climate resilience and green growth in selected critical \nwatersheds. Improvements will be monitored through (i) a reduction in economic losses due to \nflooding and landslides and in the rate of growth in greenhouse gas emissions (target of 15% \nreduction by 2023 from the 2013 baseline); and (ii) an increase in (a) adaptive capacity through \nimproved  income  levels  of  vulnerable  communities,  including  women;  and  (b)  the  amount \nbudgeted for climate change and DRRM by participating LGUs (target of 15% increase). \n \n10.  The outcome will be that, by the end of the TA in July 2016, LGUs in critical watersheds \nwill  have  increased  capacity  to  integrate  climate-resilient  and  green  growth  options  into \ndevelopment  plans,  programs,  policies,  and  projects.  The  capacity  to  bring  together  the \nconcepts of low-carbon development, resource efficiency, and adaptation to climate change will \nbe strengthened. By doing so, LGUs can significantly contribute to the achievement of the \nMillennium  Development  Goals,  particularly  in  regard  to  poverty  alleviation  (goal  1)  and \nenvironmental  sustainability  (goal  7).  Successful  demonstration  and  implementation  of \nmeasures  for  green  growth  and  resilience  will  reduce  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on \nvulnerable communities and advance the pursuit of low-carbon development at the LGU level, \nwhile contributing to sustainable urban development and poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The proposed TA will create plans for green growth and resilience in each of three \ncritical watersheds by considering five dimensions: (i) economic development; (ii) resilience to \nclimate change; (iii) biodiversity, ecosystems, and social development; (iv) greenhouse gas \nemissions; and (v) poverty alleviation. It will deliver four outputs. Staff from national agencies \nwill collaborate with LGUs and other stakeholders on the development and delivery of outputs \nthrough  participation  in  dialogues  and  training  activities.  Through  increased  awareness  of \npotential benefits of climate actions, funding opportunities, and other incentives, it is expected \nthat the national agencies and participating LGUs will remain committed to implementing locally \nappropriate measures for green growth and resilience and integrate them into development \nplans. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Current  and  future  vulnerabilities  to  climate  change  assessed  and \ngreenhouse gas inventory prepared. This will involve stocktaking and vision setting for each \nwatershed  based  on  socioeconomic  profiling  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  including \nvulnerable communities, women, and the private sector. It will include (i) collection of baseline \ndata through reviews of development plans and surveys of local institutions, governments, and \nbusinesses; (ii) assessment of vulnerability to current and future impacts of climate change; (iii) \neconomic  valuation  of  natural  resources  and  ecosystem  services;  and  (iv)  preparation  of \ngreenhouse gas inventories following the global protocol for community-scale greenhouse gas \nemissions.13 Scenario  setting  will  involve  projection  of  future  trends  in  the  use  of  natural \nresources and associated impacts.  \n \n                                                \n13 International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives \u2013 Local Governments for Sustainability, C40 Cities Climate \nLeadership Group and World Resources Institute (2012). Global Protocol for Community Scale Greenhouse Gas \nEmissions http://www.ghgprotocol.org/city-accounting \n ", "4   \n \n13.  Output 2: Gender-responsive and locally appropriate adaptation and greenhouse \ngas mitigation measures identified and prioritized. An inventory of climate change actions \nwith the most significant impact across the five dimensions relevant to green growth will be \nprepared  at  the  watershed  level.  Based  on  feedback  from  local  stakeholders\u2014including \nvulnerable communities, women, and the private sector\u2014on the feasibility and potential costs \nand benefits of implementing such actions, a short list will be prepared. Cost\u2013benefit analysis of \na few priority actions will also be conducted at the LGU level. Such efforts to increase the \nunderstanding of stakeholders of the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of climate actions will be \ncritical  for  effective  integration  of  climate  change  into  comprehensive  development  plans, \ninvestment plans, and DRRM plans of the participating LGUs. \n \n14.  Output 3: Gender-responsive priority climate change actions demonstrated. Based \non specific criteria, priority adaptation and mitigation measures\u2014such as promoting renewable \nenergy, forest rehabilitation and reforestation, community-based DRRM, and other measures \nfocusing on sustainable management of natural resources\u2014will be demonstrated.14 The primary \nfocus  of  the TA  will  be  on  nonstructural  measures,15 which  will  increase  the resilience  of \ncommunities to climate change and improve economic well-being. Community-based measures \nthat improve the resilience of women, children, and marginalized groups will be prioritized.  \n \n15.  Output  4:  Knowledge  products  disseminated  and  stakeholder  capacities \nstrengthened.  This  will  involve  (i)  disseminating  the  TA  findings  to  national  and  local \ngovernments, the private sector, and civil society through workshops, seminars, and knowledge \nproducts; (ii) documenting the process of integrating climate change into local development \nplanning  for  future  reference  of  stakeholders  in  other  areas;  (iii)  preparing  guidelines  for \neffective integration of climate concerns in local development plans; and (iv) strengthening the \ncapacity of key stakeholders including women in vulnerability assessment, economic analyses, \nand piloting of climate change actions. Such efforts will strengthen the understanding and \ncapacity of LGUs and national agencies to implement climate actions beyond the TA period.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,850,000 equivalent, of which $1,750,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months from 16 January 2014 to 15 July 2016. ADB \nwill  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  CCC  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  in  close \ncollaboration  with  participating  LGUs  and  national  agencies  including  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources and the Department of Interior and Local Government. The \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  which  collaborates  with  the  LGUs  on \nnatural resource management, and the Department of Interior and Local Government, which \ndirectly oversees the LGUs, are both members of the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation \n                                                \n14 The climate actions to be short listed and piloted vary with LGU and ecosystem characteristics. The final choice \ndepends on cost-effectiveness, potential for scaling up, mitigation potential, adaptive capacity, and other criteria.  \n15 Nonstructural measures do not involve physical construction; instead, they use knowledge, practice, or agreement \nto reduce risks and impacts through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training, and education (United \nNations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. 2009. UNISDR Terminology on Disaster Risk Reduction. \nhttp://www.preventionweb.net/files/7817_UNISDR Terminology English.pdf). \n ", "5 \n \nCabinet Cluster.16 The national agencies shall provide technical assistance in accordance with \nthe mandate specified under Republic Act 10174 (People\u2019s Survival Fund Law). \n \n18.  The TA will finance an estimated 14 person-months of international consultant inputs \nand 200 person-months of national consultant inputs, to be engaged through a consulting firm in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will recruit the consulting firm following the quality- and cost-based selection method \n(90:10) and full technical proposal procedures. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. Procurement and disbursement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procured items will be turned \nover to the implementing agency upon TA completion. \n \n19.  The  CCC  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  and  implementing  all  TA  activities, \nincluding effective monitoring of the work progress of consultants. The CCC will assign a senior \nstaff member as the focal person to coordinate project activities and delivery outputs of the TA. \nADB will accept the consulting firm\u2019s claims upon receipt of CCC endorsement certifying that the \nwork has been done satisfactorily for the period, with the corresponding reports attached.  \n \n20.  The  CCC  will  serve  as  the  focal  organization  among  involved  LGUs  and  national \nagencies. The commission will organize a project technical working group with representatives \nfrom  participating  LGUs;  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Energy, Department \nof  Science  and  Technology,  Department  of  Transport  and  Communications,  and  National \nDisaster Risk Reduction and Management Council; development partners such as ADB and the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency; academia; civil society organizations; and the private \nsector.  The  CCC  will  work  with  the  LGUs  in  formulating,  signing,  and  implementing  the \nmemorandum of agreement between the CCC and the LGUs stipulating that (i) the CCC will \nprovide  the  necessary  technical  and  financial  support  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction; and (ii) the LGUs will (a) provide free access to data, information, and facilities; (b) \nensure the safety and security of the project personnel; and (c) facilitate effective coordination \namong stakeholders in implementing the local climate change action plans and demonstration \nof green growth and climate resilience measures. \n \n21.  Progress of the TA will be monitored through the outcomes and outputs described in the \ndesign and monitoring framework. The consulting firm will submit progress reports, knowledge \nproducts, and other key deliverables to ADB after getting endorsement from the CCC. The \ncommission  will  monitor  project  progress  in  accordance  with  the  project  implementation \nschedule, and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the schedule. Within 3 \nmonths of the TA\u2019s completion, the CCC will submit a project completion report to ADB. The \nform and content of the reports will be agreed upon during the TA inception mission.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n22.
