Rapid economic growth of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has lifted about 700 \nmillion people out of poverty in the past 2 decades but has been resource and energy intensive \nbecause  of  heavily  polluting  industries,  coal-fired  energy  production,  and  an  explosion  in \nautomobile use. Air quality, in particular, has suffered. The Government of the PRC has made \nsignificant efforts to control environmental pollution by improving energy efficiency and resource \nutilization  and  increasing  pollution  reduction  measures.  However,  environmental  pollution \nremains a concern and will ultimately negatively impact the PRC\u2019s balanced socioeconomic \ngrowth.  \n \n2.  Shandong Province is one of the most important regional economies in the PRC. Its \nprovincial capital, Jinan, is a key economic, political, and transportation center in northern PRC. \nShandong Province\u2019s economy depends heavily on coal, especially for heavy industry and winter \nheating. The province alone accounts for 10% of the PRC\u2019s total energy consumption. Coal is the \nsource of 79.3% of Shandong\u2019s primary energy mix, making it the PRC\u2019s largest consumer of \ncoal. As a result, the province is a substantial contributor to air pollution in the country. In 2016, \nJinan city had the highest concentration of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in \ndiameter attributable to coal use among 74 major cities in the PRC and ranked ninth in Shandong \nProvince for the poorest air quality. Coal-based heating is the major cause of rising levels of \noutdoor and indoor air pollution during the winter. Development of reliable, cleaner, innovative \nresidential heating and cooling systems will accelerate air pollution abatement in Shandong \nProvince. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  In 2017, the Ministry of Environmental Protection introduced the Work Program for Air \nPollution Control in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) Region and Its Surrounding Areas. The \nprogram aims to implement strict pollution control measures in 28 cities, 7 of which are in \nShandong Province. The program emphasizes the importance reducing raw coal burning for \nheating supply in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas of the BTH region during winter.  \n \n4.  To help the heating and cooling sector become cleaner and more efficient in Shandong \nProvince, the Government of the PRC has requested its fourth loan of \u20ac350 million from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) under the BTH Air Quality Improvement Program. The proposed \nordinary capital resources loan will finance (i) clean heating systems that combine renewable \nenergy technologies and waste heat recovered from industry and power plants, and (ii) the \napplication of supply- and demand-side energy efficiency measures to reduce the energy and \ncarbon  intensity  of  heat  production  and  refrigeration,  thereby  reducing  air  pollution  and \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The proposed clean heating and cooling solutions will be a pilot in \nthe PRC, with a large potential to be scaled up and duplicated in similar regions within and outside \nthe country. In particular, the proposed clean heating systems for the rural areas of Shanghe \nCounty will play an important demonstration role for other rural areas in the PRC. The proposed \nclean heating systems (i) respond directly to the urgent national, provincial, and municipal \ngovernment priorities to reduce raw coal burning and improve air quality; and (ii) will provide \naffordable and clean energy to the project area, thereby addressing Sustainable Development \nGoal 7. \n ", "2  \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) aims to (i) develop a road map for rural clean \nheating in northern PRC to provide integrated solutions that combine advanced technologies, \ninnovative  financing,  and  appropriate  business  models;  (ii)  measure  air  pollution  in  rural \nhouseholds before and after the installation of clean heating systems in the project areas; (iii) \nundertake an awareness campaign on the environmental and health benefits of clean heating; \n(iv) conduct participant feedback surveys in project areas to verify the benefits of clean heating, \nincluding time saved in the preparation of household energy for heating; and (v) enhance the \nimplementing  agencies\u2019  knowledge  and  understanding  of  advanced  heating  and  cooling \ntechnologies.1 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The attached TA is aligned with the following project impact: air pollution reduced and \npublic health in the BTH region improved (consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan). \nIn  addition,  the  attached  TA  will  contribute  to  the  following  project  output:  Clean  heating \nawareness  and  capacity  to  install  and  maintain  clean  heating  and  cooling  technologies \nstrengthened.  \n \n7.  Output 1: Rural clean heating road map developed. As living standards have improved \nin the rural areas, households have transitioned from direct burning of traditional, low-quality \nfuels\u2014straw,  fuelwood,  and  other  biomass\u2014to  raw  coal  in  household  stoves  and  heating \nfacilities. Raw coal combustion, especially low-quality coal combustion, produces a large amount \nof particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and carbon monoxide.2 Therefore, the \ndevelopment of a road map to help rural residents transition to clean heating is very important to \naddress air pollution in northern PRC. \n \n8.  Output 2: Air pollution reduction measured. ADB will procure appropriate portable air \nquality monitoring devices and train local women residents in their operation and maintenance. \nThe consultants will measure and report indoor air pollution reduction in the rural households \nbefore and after the installation of clean heating systems in the project areas. Use of the solid fuel \nas supplementary will also be checked and verified if there is a coalition between the air quality \nand solid fuel use.   \n \n9.  Output 3: Awareness program designed and implemented. Lack of awareness of the \nhealth and environmental impacts of air pollution and lack of knowledge, willingness, and access \nto cleaner and energy efficient technologies are obstacles to the adoption of cleaner heating, \nespecially in rural areas. The consultant will design and implement an awareness-raising program \non the impacts of air pollution and the environmental and health benefits of clean heating. It will \nsupport gender mainstreaming by ensuring that at least 40% of participants in the awareness \nbuilding programs are women. \n \n10.  Output 4: Participant feedback survey conducted. During project preparation a social \nsurvey was designed and conducted in the project areas to collect the baseline information, \nunderstand the current heating system, gauge the residents\u2019 willingness and ability to pay. The \nconsultants will conduct a participant feedback survey after the clean heating systems have been \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 June 2018. \n2  J.

Output  5:  Gender-inclusive  capacity  development  program  implemented.  The \nheating and cooling sector of Shandong Province faces challenges in (i) meeting the growing \ndemand for heating; (ii) ensuring the reliability of the heating supply; (iii) adopting new clean \nheating and cooling technologies including installing, operating, and maintaining the facilities that \nuse  the  new  technologies;  and  (iv)  maintaining  reasonable  and  affordable  tariffs  for  end \nconsumers. Addressing these challenges will require skills development. The gender inclusive \ncapacity development will enable male and women professionals to upgrade their technical skills \nto help build core competence in the heating and cooling sector in Shandong Province. The \nsocially inclusive capacity development program will also address the needs for skilled male and \nwomen professionals to operate and maintain the new technologies, thereby helping the sector \nto adopt greener pathways. \n \n12.  The proposed clean heating and cooling systems will improve local women\u2019s access to \nclean heating supply through (i) switching energy used in cooking and heating; (ii) providing \nreliable heating, which would reduce the likelihood of becoming sick and improve quality of life; \nand (iii) relieving women from housework related to using, maintaining, and cleaning coal stoves, \nallowing them to spend more time on production, training, and self-development, resulting in \nincreased incomes. Outputs 2, 3, and 5 will directly address Sustainable Development Goal 5: \nachieving gender equality. \n \n13.
