INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission to India in 2010 \nmade provision for technical assistance (TA) in septage management,1 in response to a request \nfrom the government for assistance in urban sanitation. The country operations business plan \nfor 2011\u20132013 confirmed the processing of the TA.2 \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission discussed the TA with the Ministry of Urban Development \n(MOUD) from 30 June to 12 July 2011. This report is based on the understandings reached \nregarding  the  impact,  outcome,  output,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Better access to adequate sanitation is a national priority of the government. Inadequate \nsanitation costs the economy about $53.8 billion a year, according to a recent study.4 The \nimpact manifests itself mainly in health problems, in the extra time that goes into meeting \nsanitation needs, in potential service revenues lost, and in the negative economic impact on \ntourism. The Millennium Development Goal for sanitation enjoins governments to extend access \nto improved sanitation to at least 50% of the urban population by 2015 and to the entire urban \npopulation by 2025. The National Urban Sanitation Policy (NUSP) issued by MOUD in 2008 \nidentifies the following key policy issues: (i) low awareness of the links between sanitation and \npublic health; (ii) considerable gaps and overlaps in institutional roles and responsibilities at the \nnational,  state,  and  city  levels;  (iii) lack  of  an  integrated  citywide  approach;  (iv) limited \ntechnology choices;5 and (v) unresponsiveness to demand, especially from the unserved and \nthe poor. To transform urban India into community-driven, totally sanitary, healthy, and livable \ncities and towns, the NUSP defines these specific policy goals: (i) generating awareness and \nbehavioral  change,  (ii) achieving  open-defecation-free  cities,  and  (iii) integrating  sanitation \ncitywide. \n \n4.  On-site  sanitation.  Improving  and  maintaining  the  level  of  sanitation  services  has \nbecome increasingly challenging. Historically, the government focused on centralized sewerage \nsystems and wastewater treatment plants, and did not prioritize on-site sanitation. Wastewater \ndisposal through conventional sewerage, however, is not always the technically best solution or \nthe most cost effective. Demographic and geographic constraints make conventional sewerage \ntechnically unfeasible and financially unaffordable. Particularly in peri-urban and tourist sites \naway from densely populated developed areas, on-site sanitation, including proper septage \nmanagement, is an alternative. One study of urban areas in India showed that a significant part \nof  the  population  relies  on  on-site  sanitation  and  proper  septage  management;  29%  of \nhouseholds are connected to a septic tank, while 17% use other on-site sanitation systems like \npit or vault latrines.6 The NUSP has changed the country\u2019s approach to urban sanitation, and \n                                                \n1  \u2015Septage management\u2016 often refers to management of on-site sewage facility. \n2   ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 March 2011. \n4  The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Sanitation in India, Water and Sanitation Program, ADB, Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development,  and  Department  for  International  Development  (United  Kingdom).  2010. The \nEconomic Impacts of Inadequate Sanitation in India: Water and Sanitation Program. \n5  The NUSP statement that \u2015Technologies have been focused on limited options that have not been cost-effective, \nand sustainability of investments has been in question\u2016 suggests that on-site sanitation was not prioritized. \n6  United States Agency for International Development. 2010.

Collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal. The NUSP emphasizes the need \nfor adequate septage management to achieve the goal of 100% safe sanitation. Urban local \nbodies (ULBs) are expected to develop strategies for full access to improved sanitation, through \ntheir city sanitation plans (CSPs), that address the technical issues and are associated with \nfinancially implementable plans. If a centralized sewerage system is not technically or financially \njustified, even for limited areas, the NUSP calls for ULBs and states to issue policies and \nprovide technical solutions to on-site sanitation and septage management. Very few cities in \nIndia, however, have the physical capacity to safely collect, transport, and treat urban human \nwaste. As a result, septic tanks and latrines in urban areas have become major sources of \ngroundwater and surface water pollution, with significant negative impact on the environment, \npublic health, and the economy. Appropriate policy and technical guidelines are needed to \npromote the use of such systems and extend the benefits of improved sanitation and better \npublic health to more people. The Technical Guidance Note on Septage Management in Indian \nCities,  now  being  prepared  by  MOUD,  explicitly  requires  all  ULBs  to  prepare  a  septage \nmanagement plan (SMP) as part of their CSP. \n \n6.  The need for proper septage management has been confirmed during the preparation \nand implementation of ADB-funded loan projects. Sewerage development does not always \ncover the entire ULB area, and the remaining non-sewered areas have demanded improved \non-site sanitation, despite its not being part of the scope of the projects. Septage treatment is \none of the on-site sanitation options, and it requires proper management. Also, ULBs need \nsupport in putting a septage management service into operation by developing management \nplans  and  implementation  schemes  for  on-site  sanitation.  The  proposed  TA  will  therefore \nsupport the pilot ULBs in Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh in developing SMPs with CSPs and in \nimplementing, on a pilot scale, on-site sanitation systems using international best practices,7 \nparticularly in tourist destinations. ADB supported the development of infrastructure in the two \nstates under the North-Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program and the \nInfrastructure Development Investment Program for Tourism.8 It has been recognized that the \nprovision of sanitation facilities such as public toilets under the ADB-funded tourism project has \ndemanded proper operation and management, which requires the concerned ULBs to conduct \nappropriate septage management. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  access  to  proper  sanitation  facilities  for \nnon-sewered  urban  areas,  as  measured  by  the  number  of  ULBs  implementing  adequate \nseptage management practices according to an acceptable SMP. The target number is 10. The \noutcome will be the recognition by the four selected ULBs of the importance of appropriate \nsanitation  and  septage  management  incorporating  best  practices.  Such  recognition  will  be \nmeasured by the quality of the CSPs and SMPs approved by the four ULBs and the urban \ndevelopment departments of the states of Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh. \n                                                \n7  From European countries, such as Germany and France, and from Japan. \n8  ADB. 2009.

The TA will support the development of draft CSPs for four ULBs in the states of \nMizoram and Himachal Pradesh. The output will comprise the following: (i) situation analysis, \n(ii) draft CSPs, and (iii) CSPs upgraded through consultations. The four ULBs\u2014Aizawl and \nLunglei in Mizoram, and Mandi and Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh\u2014were identified at the \ninitiative of the urban development departments of the states, which expect the benefits to \ncomplement those from  ongoing  projects  such  as  the  North-Eastern Region  Capital  Cities \nDevelopment Investment Program and the Infrastructure Development Investment Program for \nTourism  (footnote 8).  Aizawl\u2019s  draft  CSP  needs  to  be  updated  and  strengthened  for \nnon-sewered  areas.  The  three  other  ULBs  will  need  comprehensive  situation  analysis  in \npreparation for CSP development. \n \n9.  A citywide, total-sanitation, and inclusive approach to CSP preparation will be taken. A \ncity-level implementation committee will be established to oversee the activities. The members \nof the committee will be government officials and representatives of business and commercial \ncommunities, academe, civil society, nongovernment organizations, industry, and residents. \nConsultations will be managed by the committee with the support of consultants. \n \n2.  Development of Draft Septage Management Plans for Pilot Cities or Areas \n10.  The TA will also support the drafting of an SMP with a manual of practice for one ULB in \neach  of  the  two  states.  The  ULBs  will  be  selected  during  the  preparation  of  the  CSPs, \nconsidering the need for septage management. Links to ongoing projects will be considered as \nwell.  The  management  plans  might  be  citywide  or  area-wide,  depending  on  the  need  for \nseptage management and its feasibility, as determined in the CSPs. During this exercise, \nappropriate  performance  indicators  will  be  scrutinized,  in  addition  to  the  service-level \nbenchmarks being developed by MOUD.  \n \n3.  Support for Septage Management Plan Implementation in the Pilot Areas \n11.  This TA will carry out a pilot scheme to verify the feasibility of the SMPs, with a manual \nof practice also to be developed under this TA. The pilot implementation may be done at sites of \nnew investment in ongoing projects. Since the private sector has a critical role in septage \nmanagement,  a  public\u2013private  partnership  scheme  will  be  explored.  In  addition,  pilot \ndemonstration of the johkasou system9 may be considered for any tourist destination if feasibility \nis confirmed through an SMP. \n \n4.  Conduct of Training and Workshops \n12.  A series of consultations will be held with relevant stakeholders in the course of CSP \ndevelopment. In addition, training and workshops will be provided in the two pilot cities to \ndisseminate the essence of the SMPs, and to implement the plan in a sustainable manner. \n                                                \n9  The johkasou (anaerobic filtration) system is an on-site sanitation technology option commonly used in sparsely \npopulated areas in Japan where sewerage is not viable or cost effective. Each compact package unit (per house or \nper small community) carries out both anaerobic and aerobic treatment and final disinfection, with the final effluent \nbeing discharged directly into local drains. System operation requires some power consumption. \n ", "4 \nJapanese  best  practices  in  septage  management  at  remote  tourist  destinations  will  be \ndisseminated through workshops in both states and in New Delhi. \n \nC.  Assumptions and Risks \n13.  As mentioned, the NUSP requires all ULBs to draw up adequate septage management \nstrategies through their CSPs. The TA assumes that the pilot ULBs are eager to fulfill the \nrequirements  and  exercise  adequate  ownership. On  the  other  hand,  there  is  the  risk that \nstakeholders, including residents, may be unwilling to accept a septage management option, \nthough  it  is  technically  justified.  A  centralized  sewerage  system  might  be  deemed  more \nattractive because of its convenience. The consultations for CSP preparation and the proposed \npilot schemes will demonstrate the feasibility of the on-site sanitation option, to make the public \nmore  aware  of  the  effectiveness  of  this  option  when  combined  with  appropriate  septage \nmanagement. The social development and communication specialist will identify the target \nstakeholders, as well as the need of training for the purpose. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \n$700,000  equivalent,  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of office space, the remuneration of counterpart staff, including field per \ndiems and transportation costs, and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOUD will be the executing agency for the TA. The urban development departments of \nMizoram  and  Himachal  Pradesh  will  be  the  implementing  agencies,  and  will  support  the \nsuccessful completion of the TA. Four ULBs\u2014Mandi and Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh, and \nAizawl and Lunglei in Mizoram\u2014have been identified for the study. \n \n16.  The government will provide (i) all relevant documents, data, statistics, information, and \nmaps that are at its disposal; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff, including their field \nper diems and transportation costs; (iii) a project director from MOUD, to be assigned before the \nconsultants mobilize; (iv) office accommodation and office equipment, including desks, chairs, \nlocal communication, and water and electricity costs; (v) logistic assistance in the training and \nworkshops; and (vi) facilitation of communication support from the participating ULBs. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2012 to December 2013, \nincluding the recruitment of consultants but not financial closure. It is assumed that 3 months \nwill be required to obtain confirmation from the government after approval. The TA will use \n48 person-months  of  national  consultants\u2019  input,  and  2 person-months  of  input  from  an \ninternational expert to introduce international best practices in septage management, focusing \non remote areas such as tourist destinations. The international expert will be provided by the \nJapan Sanitation Consortium under a separate (partnership) agreement to be entered into with \nADB once the TA is approved. The outline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix \n3. \n \n18.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  by  ADB  according  to  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Two teams of consultants will be hired for \nthe states of Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram, mostly through a firm and through quality- and \ncost-based selection (at an 80:20 ratio) using biodata technical proposals. Other consultants will \n ", "5 \nbe  hired  individually,  also  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Upon  TA  completion,  all  equipment \npurchased under the TA will be handed over to MOUD or to the implementing agencies through \nMOUD. \n \n19.  Workshops  and  training  sessions  for  relevant  government  officials,  nongovernment \norganizations, civil society groups, and local business communities\u2014the main stakeholders\u2014 \nwill be an important component of this TA. The workshops and training will be held to improve \nawareness and understanding of septage management. TA findings will be disseminated during \nthe workshops and training sessions, as well as during the consultations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Introducing \nBest Practices for Septage Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved access to  Ten ULBs implement  MOUD report  Service-level \nproper sanitation  adequate septage  benchmarks are \nfacilities for the urban  management practices  implemented over \npopulation of  according to acceptable  time. \nnon-sewered areas.

The  objective  of  the  assignment  is  to  assist  the  government  in  establishing  an \nappropriate  implementation  scheme for  septage  management  through  the  provision  of  city \nsanitation plans (CSPs) with septage management plans (SMPs) and manuals of practice, \nfocusing  on  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal,  as  well  as  introducing  international  best \npractices in septage management. In addition, this technical assistance (TA) will explore the \ndevelopment  of  performance  indicators,  which  are  supposed  to  be  used  as  service-level \nbenchmarks for septage. Specific output will comprise: (i) draft CSPs for pilot cities, (ii) draft \nSMPs,  (iii) the  implementation  of  a  pilot  scheme  in  pilot  areas,  (iv) training  for  relevant \nstakeholders, and (v) workshops to disseminate the lessons learned from the pilot schemes and \ninternational best practices. The scope of works for consultants and terms of reference for each \nconsultant are presented below. \n \n2.  The  TA  will  require  about  48  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The \nconsultants will be hired by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) according to its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Separate sets of consultants will \nrecruited for Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram states, through a firm or individually, except for the \nknowledge management and training specialist and the technical adviser, who will work for both \nstates. In addition to these consultants, an international expert in sanitation will be hired to \nintroduce international best practices in septage management in Japan, by agreement with the \nJapan Sanitation Consortium. \n \nA.  Specific Tasks of Consultants \n \n1.  Draft City Sanitation Plan \n \n3.  The consultants will develop CSPs for selected cities in consultation with the Ministry of \nUrban Development (MOUD) and urban local bodies (ULBs). First, the consultants will review \nthe current status of planning and implementation of sanitation improvement programs in the \nfour pilot cities\u2014Aizawl and Lunglei in Mizoram, and Mandi and Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh. \nThe consultants are expected to communicate with consultants working under two ADB-funded \nprojects, namely, the North-Eastern Region Capital Cities Development Investment Program, \nand Infrastructure Development Investment Program for Tourism.1 Once the status of sanitation \nimprovement in the two ULBs in each state is confirmed (possibly suggesting that a sewerage \ndevelopment plan may exist but may not cover the entire area, and that on-site sanitation may \nbe considered), the consultants will prepare the draft CSPs. Then appropriate consultation \nprocedures will be carried out to accommodate the needs of stakeholders and to finalize the \nCSP. The detailed procedures should be confirmed before implementation in accordance with \nthe  procedures  executed  by  other  development  partners  such  as  the  World  Bank,  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom, the United States Agency for \nInternational  Development,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA).  The \nconsultants may coordinate with the JICA sanitation expert in MOUD. \n \n   \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.
