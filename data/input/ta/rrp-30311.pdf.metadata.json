About 73 percent of the\npeople in the project area are estimated to be poor. This\nlevel of poverty is higher than that in the country as a\nwhole.  The  Project  will  (i)  rehabilitate  sections  of  the\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road;  (ii)  improve  secondary  roads  in  the\nproject  area;  (iii)  provide  consulting  services  for\nconstruction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and\nimplementation of reformed road maintenance practices;\nand (iv) procure light equipment for road maintenance. The\nProject will reduce poverty by lowering transport costs for\nroad  users  and  by  improving  access  to  markets  and\nemployment opportunities. Improving the secondary roads\nwill also improve access to more comprehensive health\nfacilities.\nClassification Poverty: Other\nThematic: Economic growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken, and\na summary is a core appendix.\nRationale The Project will continue the rehabilitation program for the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road, which (i) is the most important transport\ncorridor in the country, providing the only internal surface\nconnection  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic's  two  most\nimportant commercial and political centers; and (ii) forms\npart  of  an  important  regional  corridor.  The  Project  will\nrehabilitate the most deteriorated of the remaining sections\nof the road in Jalal\u2013Abad and Osh provinces, as well as\nsecondary roads providing access to poor villages and rural\nareas. About 73 percent of the people in the project area\nare  estimated  to  be  poor\u2014a  figure  substantially  higher\nthan  the  national  level\u2014and  about  28  percent  are\nestimated  to  be  extremely  poor.  The  Project  will  reduce\npoverty in the project area by lowering transport costs for\nroad  users  and  by  improving  access  to  markets,\nemployment  opportunities,  and  more  comprehensive\nhealth facilities for a large number of poor people.\nObjectives and Scope The objective is to reduce poverty and promote sustainable\neconomic growth by reducing the cost of road transport\nand  improving  access  to  markets  in  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh\ncorridor. Specifically, the Project will (i) reduce transport", "iii\ncosts  by  rehabilitating  the  most  deteriorated  of  the\nremaining sections of the road linking Bishkek and Osh; (ii)\nreduce transport costs and improve access to markets and\nhealth facilities by improving secondary roads in the project\narea; (iii) support regulatory reform in the road sector; and\n(iv) assist in improving road maintenance practices and\nensuring a sustainable and adequate level of financing for\nroad maintenance. The Project comprises (i) rehabilitation\nof about 120 kilometers of the two\u2013lane national highway\nfrom Bishkek to Osh, in particular, km 427\u2013498 in Jalal\u2013\nAbad  province,  and  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section  in  Osh\nprovince,  including  provision  of  safety  features;  (ii)\nimprovement of about 125 km of secondary roads in Jalal\u2013\nAbad feeding into the Bishkek\u2013Osh road; (iii) consulting\nservices  for  construction  supervision,  monitoring  and\nevaluation,  and  implementation  of  reformed  road\nmaintenance  practices;  and  (iv)  procurement  of  light,\nhand\u2013operated equipment and truck\u2013mounted cranes for\nroutine maintenance of selected secondary roads and the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $50 million\nequivalent,  including  physical  contingencies,  price\nescalation,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during\nconstruction, but excluding Value Added Tax and other\ntaxes. Of the total cost, $30.6 million (61.2 percent) is the\nforeign exchange cost and $19.4 million equivalent (38.8\npercent) is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan\n     ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Percent\nExchange Currency Cost\nAsian 30.6 9.4 40.0 80\nDevelopment\nBank\nGovernment 0.0 10.0 10.0 20\nTotal 30.6 19.4 50.0 100\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of SDR 31,778,000 ($40 million equivalent) from the\nAsian  Development  Bank's  (ADB's)  Special  Funds\nresources  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nstandard terms and conditions for loans from its Special\nFunds resources.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Third Road Rehabilitation Project. The report also describes\nproposed advisory technical assistance for Institutional Support in the Transport Sector, and if\nthe proposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated by the\nBoard, shall approve the technical assistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\nI. \n2. During the Asian Development Bank's (ADB's) 2000 Country Programming Mission, the\nGovernment of the Kyrgyz Republic reconfirmed its request for further ADB assistance to\ndevelop the country\u2019s road sector and to implement the Third Road Rehabilitation Project. The\nProject  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  regional  cooperation.  The  Government\nreceived a project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to update the transport sector profile\u2014\nincluding an assessment of the priority needs of the sector\u2014and prepare the feasibility study for\nthe proposed Project. Fact\u2013finding for the Project was undertaken and a tripartite meeting to\ndiscuss the findings of the Third Road Rehabilitation TA was held during 27 February\u201313 March\n2001,  and  loan  appraisal  was  conducted  during  24  May\u20136  June  2001.2  The  Project  was\nformulated  from  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,\ndiscussions with other funding agencies and road sector representatives, and the findings of the\nThird Road Rehabilitation TA (footnote 1). If approved, the proposed loan will be ADB's fourth to\nthe transport sector of the Kyrgyz Republic. The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. The Transport Sector\n1. General\n3. The  transport  infrastructure  inherited  by  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  was\ndesigned to facilitate integration of the republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU) with Russia,\nrather than to serve the needs of independent countries. As a result, the transport networks of\nthe CARs often do not meet their domestic and international transport requirements. The Kyrgyz\nRepublic is a mountainous, landlocked country, and road transport dominates the country's\ntransport sector. Road transport accounted for about 97 percent of freight tonnage movements\nand almost all passenger traffic in 1999 (Appendix 2). Railways carry most of the remaining\nfreight, including a substantial part of the cross\u2013border traffic, by means of separate branch\nlines that link the north of the country to the Kazakh rail system, and the south of the country to\nthe Uzbek system, with no direct connection between the two links. Due to longer average\nhaulage, railways account for about 21 percent of the total freight in terms of ton\u2013kilometers\n(ton\u2013km). Air transport accounts for less than 1 percent of passenger movements, mainly on\nroutes between Bishkek and Osh. Water transport is confined to a few small vessels on Lake\nIssyk\u2013Kul.\n                  \n1 TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.\n2 The Missions comprised J. Miller, Mission Leader/Project Economist; F. Agnello, Poverty Reduction Specialist; L.\nNazarbekova, Counsel; and K. Saari, Transport Specialist.", "2\n4. As with most other republics of the FSU, the economic crisis stemming from the breakup\nof the FSU resulted in a decline in economic activity and disrupted customary trading patterns.\nThe demand for transport has fallen dramatically since independence. The lowest levels were\nreached in 1995 when the volumes of freight in ton\u2013km and passenger movements were only\n14 percent and 33 percent of their respective 1990 levels, reflecting a sharp decline in real\nincomes and output. The gross domestic product (GDP) and demand for freight and passenger\ntransport grew substantially in 1996 and 1997; however, GDP growth slowed in 1998 because\nof (i) the impact of the economic crisis in Russia, (ii) damage to the infrastructure caused by\nflooding in the Fergana valley, and (iii) a substantial reduction in tourism revenue caused by\nadverse publicity concerning the cyanide spill at Lake Issyk\u2013Kul. Accordingly, the transport\ndemand for freight tons and ton\u2013km in 1999 was unchanged and lower, respectively, compared\nwith the 1997 levels. Since most of the roads were designed for higher traffic capacities and are\nunderutilized, the existing basic transport infrastructure is adequate for the level of economic\nactivity likely to occur in the medium term. Consequently, the primary concern is not expansion\nor  major  upgrading  of  the  transport  system,  but  proper  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  to\npreserve the existing network.\n5. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is responsible for policymaking\nin and regulating, planning, and developing the transport and communications sectors in the\nKyrgyz Republic. In conjunction with the policy dialogue under the Second Road Rehabilitation\nProject3 and following the passage of Law No. 8 on Transport and issuance of Decree No. 419\nin  1998,  MOTC  was  restructured  to  improve  its  efficiency  (Appendix  3).  As  part  of  the\nrestructuring, a Government decree was issued in January 1999 requiring consolidation of the\nadministration of transport\u2013related activities. This resulted in a restructuring of responsibilities\namong the Ministry of Architecture and Construction, Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), and\nMOTC (para. 21).\n6. Railway  and  air  transport  are  under  MOTC's  jurisdiction.  MOTC  exercises  both\nregulatory and operational functions for the railway network, which has a combined length of\n424  km.  Railways  are  expected  to  remain  under  Government  ownership.  A  joint\u2013stock\ncompany,  National  Aircompany  Kyrgyzstan  Aba  Joldory,  serves  as  the  Kyrgyz  Republic's\nnational airline and also operates the country's airports. The Government plans to separate\noperations of the airline and airports in the future. MOTC also exercises general regulatory and\nmonitoring functions for the operations of road transport for freight and passengers.\n2. The Road Sector\na. The Road Network\n7. The road network in the Kyrgyz Republic covers all seven provinces (oblasts), and\nprovides connections to far\u2013flung communities and links to neighboring countries. The Bishkek\u2013\nOsh road provides links between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the south and Kazakhstan and\nRussia in the north. There are 18,876 km of roads under MOTC jurisdiction: 9,803 km of state\nroads and 9,073 km of local roads. Roads are divided into five design categories, distinguished\nmainly by carriageway width. About 15 percent of the roads are in category I (15 meters [m] or\nwider), category II (9\u201311.5 m), and category III (7.5 m); 85 percent are in category IV (6 m) and\ncategory V (4.5 m). About 40 percent of the roads are sealed, including some with gravel mixed\nwith bitumen binder. Over 50 percent are gravel and less than 10 percent are earth roads. The\n                  \n3 Loan 1630\u2013KGZ(SF): Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 10 September 1998.", "3\ncoverage of the road network is generally adequate for the developmental needs of the country.\nOf primary concern is the deteriorating state of the roads at all levels; over 60 percent now\nrequire periodic maintenance or rehabilitation.\n8. There are 15,000 km of roads outside MOTC's jurisdiction, mainly rural and farm roads.\nMost  were  formerly  the  responsibility  of  state  and  collective  farms.  The  responsibility  for\nmaintaining rural and farm roads is now with the local district administrations following the\nprogressive breakup of the state and collective farming system.\nb.  Road Standards and Safety\n9. The  FSU's  road  standards  and  specifications  continue  to  be  used  in  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic. A number of studies have indicated that the design standards of FSU state roads are\ngenerally comparable with those of the United States or Western Europe, but do not always\nresult  in  optimum  road  design.  Roads  constructed  during  the  FSU  period  were  generally\ndesigned for axle loads of 6\u20138 tons (t). Since independence, axle loads of 10\u201312 t and even\nhigher have become common, which has considerably reduced the residual design life of\npavements. Unlike the design standards, the quality of road construction during the FSU was\nrarely  acceptable,  mainly  because  of  lack  of  cost\u2013effective  construction  techniques,  and\ninadequate  independent  construction  supervision  and  quality  control.  Road  design  and\nconstruction  standards  were  reviewed  through  an  ADB\u2013financed  TA4  for  three  CARs\n(Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan) and Mongolia to prepare road design and\nconstruction standards that are suitable for market\u2013oriented operations. These standards will be\napplied to the civil works in the Project.\n 10. ADB  is  also  significantly  involved  in  improving  road  safety  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,\nthrough the Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3) and the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional\nRoad Rehabilitation Project.5 The Second Road Rehabilitation Project prepared a time\u2013bound\nroad  safety  program  to  reduce  the  accident  rate.  Under  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Project,  the\nGovernment agreed to establish the National Road Safety Council (NRSC) with a full\u2013time\nsecretariat  to  coordinate  road  safety  activities  and  involve  the  various  stakeholders.  The\nGovernment also agreed to update the Road Safety Act (RSA) for submission to parliament.\nThe RSA will include legislation concerning safe driving, safety audit of road designs, safety\neducation, road safety publicity, vehicle safety standards, road safety research, and emergency\nassistance to accident victims. An advisory TA attached to the Almaty\u2013Bishkek Project will help\nthe Government to establish the NRSC, update the RSA, prepare a Russian version of the\nRoad Safety Guidelines prepared under an earlier TA,6 and conduct road safety seminars to\nimplement the Road Safety Guidelines.\nc.  Vehicle Traffic and Fleet\n11. The busiest roads on the outskirts of Bishkek typically carry an average annual daily\ntraffic (AADT) of about 10,000 vehicles, while traffic levels on similar roads around Osh reach\nabout 4,500 AADT. Sections of main roads farther away from the larger towns, such as the\ncentral sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, now carry about 1,000\u20131,500 AADT. Cars and vans\ngenerally comprise the majority of traffic on these roads. Prior to the economic crisis, traffic\n                  \n4  TA 5733\u2013REG: A Review of Road Design and Construction Standards, for $600,000, approved on 3 April 1997.\n5  Loan 1774\u2013KAZ: Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, for $65 million, approved on 31 October\n2000; Loan 1775\u2013KGZ: Almaty\u2013Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project, for $5 million, approved on 31 October\n2000.\n6 TA 5620\u2013REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.", "4\nvolumes  on  some  road  sections  were  three  and  six  times  higher  in  terms  of  freight  and\npassengers, respectively. Seasonal variations, reflecting both changes in transport demand and\nweather\u2013related constraints, are significant on roads crossing the central mountainous areas of\nthe country.\n12. In  1998,  the  country's  vehicle  fleet  comprised  about  56,500  trucks,  13,200  buses,\n197,100  cars,  and  39,900  other  vehicles.  Since  1993,  the  number  of  cars  has  increased\nsubstantially, buses have increased by a small amount, and trucks and other vehicles have\ndecreased substantially. The fleet is aging, since few companies have been in a position to buy\nmodern vehicles. Over half the truck fleet has a capacity of less than 7 t, with a predominance of\n5\u2013t trucks. Longer distance interurban freight movements are handled mainly by three\u2013axle\nvehicles and semi\u2013trailers with average payloads in the range of 8\u201315 t. About 5 percent of the\nfleet has a capacity of 15 t or more.\n13. Vehicle ownership patterns have changed dramatically since independence, when there\nwas almost no private ownership of vehicles. About 95 percent of cars are privately owned.\nPreviously,  state  organizations  owned  and  operated  most  trucks  and  buses.  With  the\nintroduction of the privatization program and auctions, individuals now own 26 percent of the\ntrucks and 23 percent of the buses. The rest are owned and operated by transport companies.\nThe majority of the fleet is still made up of vehicles manufactured in the FSU. Some trucking\ncompanies have procured secondhand trucks of larger capacity and of more modern design,\nmainly for use on international routes. A significant number of cars, most of them secondhand,\nare now being imported from Western Europe for private use.\nd. Road Transport Industry\n14. Transport companies were controlled by a joint\u2013stock holding company, Kyrgyz Auto\nTransport until 1994, when Decree No. 61 abolished the company and transferred its functions\nto MOTC. Of the total 251 transport sector enterprises in the Kyrgyz Republic, 126 have been\nprivatized,  primarily  through  conversion  to  joint\u2013stock  companies.  Currently  86  companies\nprovide road transport services, and 74 of them have been privatized. The companies that have\nnot  been  privatized  comprise  urban  bus  enterprises  in  major  cities  and  some  enterprises\nconnected with state security. The transport companies employ about 25,000 people. Most of\nthe freight and passenger transport companies operate at the provincial and district (raion) level,\nwith a small number of national\u2013level operators. As a result of measures that the Government\nintroduced in 1994 to increase competition, most of the national and provincial holding companies\nand  associations  (which  had  continued  to  exercise  control  over  the  operations  of  individual\ntransport companies) were abolished.\n15. Through ownership and regulation the Government continues to have a strong influence in\nthe market for intercity passenger transport. The Government maintains large holdings in the\njoint\u2013stock companies operating transport services. Buses must travel designated routes and\noperate out of Government\u2013owned bus stations. Kyrgyz Transport Inspection, created in MOTC in\n1994, issues transport licenses and regulates transport services. The Project will address these\nand other issues affecting competitiveness of the market for passenger transport services through\npolicy dialogue (para. 34).\n16. The market for freight transport services is more competitive than that for passenger\ntransport. Freight transport customers are free to negotiate conditions of price and quality of\nservice directly with the operators. Freight forwarders are encouraged to negotiate and arrange\nintermodal transport services, thus facilitating door\u2013to\u2013door transport arrangements, and to offer", "5\nservices  directly  themselves.  However,  the  Government  also  plays  a  large  role  in  freight\ntransport,  through  its  holdings  in  joint\u2013stock  companies  and  through  regulation.  MOTC  is\nresponsible for monitoring and regulation, including licensing, inspection, and safety audits.\nCompetitiveness of the market for freight transport services is also being addressed by the\nProject through policy dialogue (para. 34).\ne.  Road Sector Revenue and Expenditure\n17. The Kyrgyz Republic is recovering from the adverse impact of the 1998 Russian crisis\nand registered GDP growth of 5 percent in 2000. However, the Government is still facing a\ndifficult fiscal situation and high external debt burden, and the IMF's current PRGF has lapsed.\nDespite fiscal restraint, the fiscal deficit of 10.2 percent of GDP for 2000 was much higher than\nthe target (para 25).\n18. Financing for the road sector suffers from the overall fiscal constraints and is inadequate\nfor the country\u2019s needs. In 1999, MOTC estimated the annual requirement for the road sector\n(including  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  administration,  and  design)  at  about  Som700\nmillion. Total road\u2013sector\u2013related revenues comprised Som492 million; however, only Som343\nmillion  was  allocated  to  MOTC,  and  only  Som142  million  of  that  was  allocated  for  road\nmaintenance.\n19. With  the  assistance  of  an  ADB\u2013financed  TA  for  institutional  strengthening,7  the\nGovernment passed the Road Fund Act in 1998 and, as specified in the loan covenants for the\nSecond Road Rehabilitation Project, is collecting road user charges prescribed under the act.\nAccording to the Road Fund Act, a portion of the road sector revenues should be deposited into\na separate road fund account. The specific sources of revenue for the road fund are (i) 50\npercent of the excise taxes on fuel, (ii) 100 percent of the 0.8 percent tax on enterprises, (iii) 100\npercent of the tax on vehicle owners, (iv) 90 percent of vehicle registration fees, (v) charges for\nthe use of toll roads and tunnels, (vi) charges for oversize and overweight vehicles, (vii) state\nbudget  allocations,  and  (viii)  foreign  loans  and  grants.  In  1999,  collections  of  revenues\ndesignated by statute for deposit in the road fund, excluding state budget allocations and foreign\nloans and grants, totaled approximately Som415 million. However, due to the severe fiscal\nproblems faced by the Kyrgyz Republic (para. 17), a separate account for the road fund has not\nbeen established. Instead the Ministry of Finance (MOF) makes annual allocations for road\nmaintenance and other road sector expenditures based on overall budget considerations. The\nallocations  have  been  inadequate  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  needs  (para.  18).  The  Project  is\naddressing  the  issue  of  ensuring  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance  through  policy\ndialogue (paras. 35\u201336).\nf. Road Administration\n20. Organizational Structure. The Automobile Roads Act gives the main responsibility for\nplanning  and  administering  road  sector  policies,  programs,  and  projects  to  MOTC.  The\nDepartment of Roads (DOR) under MOTC is responsible for managing the road sector. MOTC's\nseven regional road maintenance agencies (RRMAs), one in each province, plus the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh Road Division are responsible for maintaining the state and local roads under MOTC's\njurisdiction. The RRMAs and Bishkek\u2013Osh Road Division are composed of 82 local maintenance\nunits (LMUs) that carry out actual maintenance works. Other important agencies in the road\n                  \n7  TA 2587\u2013KGZ: Institutional Strengthening of the Road Sector, for $800,000, approved on 13 June 1996.", "6\nsector are (i) KyrgyzIntrans, a holding agency for six freight transport companies and forwarding\nagencies engaged mainly in international trade; and (ii) technical agencies in various stages of\ndivestment from MOTC\u2019s control, including the Road Design Institute (Kyrgyzdortransproect)\nand a small agency responsible for developing and testing new road construction techniques\nand equipment (Kyrgyztranstekhnika).\n21. ADB has assisted MOTC in streamlining management of the road sector. In 1998, the\nDirectorate General for Rehabilitation and Maintenance of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, established\nthrough Decree No. 45 of 4 March 1996 under the Office of the Prime Minister, was integrated\ninto DOR. The Government has completed the transfer of responsibilities for developing road\ndesign and construction standards from the Ministry of Architecture and Construction to MOTC.\nOn 30 November 1999 MIA and MOTC agreed to jointly administer the functions of road safety\nand traffic management, while leaving the responsibility for vehicle inspection with MIA.\n22. Planning  and  Budgeting.  In  the  past,  road  expenditure  plans  and  budgets  were\nprepared on the basis of periodic assessments of road conditions, using norms and technical\njudgment to decide the level of required interventions and their priority. Neither an economic\noptimization of investments nor a correlation of expenditures to user charges was undertaken.\nWith the drastic reduction in road financing and the restructuring of the road sector institutions,\nthe planning and budgeting system collapsed. To determine the broad expenditure priorities in\naccordance with road traffic, road conditions, and possible types of intervention, ADB assisted\nMOTC through the Institutional Strengthening TA (footnote 7) in reviewing the existing planning\nand  budgeting  practices  for  road  maintenance  and  in  preparing  preliminary  estimates  of\nrehabilitation and maintenance needs for the national road network, including the Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad. The TA on Policy Support in the Transport Sector8 gave recommendations for improving\nfinancial  management  in  MOTC.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  implement  the\nrecommendations (para. 80).\n23. Construction  and  Maintenance.  The  Government  has  made  substantial  efforts  to\nprivatize  road  construction  and  maintenance  operations.  All  of  the  29  road  construction\nenterprises have been privatized. The uncertainty relating to DOR's road construction program\nhas hindered developing the private road construction industry. However, ADB's ongoing road\nrehabilitation projects have assisted in developing the privatized road construction enterprises\nthrough extensive subcontracting by the civil works contractors.\n24. The RRMAs of MOTC have overall responsibility for carrying out road maintenance. At\nthe operational level, the 82 LMUs under the RRMAs maintain 18,876 km of state and local\nroads under MOTC jurisdiction (para. 7). Local authorities maintain roads not under MOTC\njurisdiction (para. 8). The total staff of the RRMAs and LMUs is around 3,000 people. Through\nits ongoing projects, ADB has been working with MOTC to improve the equipment and methods\nused for road maintenance. Under the Second Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 3), a\nmaintenance manual was prepared, and training of maintenance personnel is now under way.\nMaintenance equipment for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road is being purchased through the cofinanced\nportion of the first Road Rehabilitation Project.9 With ADB assistance, MOTC also established\nthe equipment pool, which is now leasing equipment to contractors for road sector activities. In\nthe future, this equipment can be used by contractors to conduct road maintenance. While the\nGovernment wants to retain the LMUs as part of MOTC, it has undertaken measures, with ADB\nassistance, to contract out road maintenance activities. Under the Second Road Rehabilitation\n                  \n8  TA 3065\u2013KGZ: Policy Support in the Transport Sector, for $600,000, approved on 10 September 1998.\n9  Loan 1444\u2013KGZ(SF): Road Rehabilitation Project, for $50 million, approved on 13 June 1996.", "7\nProject,  the  Government  has  invited  bids  from  local  contractors  to  undertake  routine\nmaintenance on a section of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. Under the proposed Project, the contracting\nout of road maintenance will be expanded (para. 37).\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n25. Public investment in the transport sector dropped from about 2 percent of the gross\nnational product (GNP) in 1990 to near zero during 1995. As a result, the transport infrastructure\nhas deteriorated to a point where major reconstruction will be required unless adequate funds are\nallocated for rehabilitation and maintenance. Transport investment needs to increase to about 4\npercent of GDP to avoid major reconstruction in the future. In 1998 and 1999, expenditures in the\ntransport sector were, respectively, Som751 million (2.2 percent of GDP), and Som800 million\n(2.3 percent of GDP), of which Som273 million was for roads. Increased investment in the\ntransport sector is dependent on continued economic growth. However, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s\nhigh external public debt burden, at $1.24 billion or 95 percent of GDP, poses a substantial threat\nto economic growth. The IMF and the Government are preparing a detailed strategy to address\nthe debt situation, including the Government reaching agreement with the Paris Club on debt\nrescheduling.10  Subject  to  the  Government  and  IMF  reaching  agreement  on  the  economic\nprogram shortly, a new three\u2013year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) could be in\nplace before the end of 2001. The new PRGF program is expected to include limits on Public\nInvestment Program (PIP) disbursements and thus external borrowing. Under the lapsed PRGF,\nthe Government and the IMF agreed that PIP disbursements would be limited to 6.0 percent of\nGDP in 2001 and 5.5 percent in 2002, and would progressively fall to 3.0 percent by 2005. To\nmeet these limits, the Government has prioritized ongoing projects in the PIP; prioritization of\nfuture projects is still ongoing. The Government has assured ADB that the PIP gives highest\npriority to rehabilitation of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.\n26. The Government's transport sector strategy and plans are included in the Transport and\nRoad Sector Policy Statement prepared under the institutional strengthening TA (footnote 7)\nand issued by MOTC in 1997, and in the PIP being prepared by MOF. The Government's\noverall policy objectives for the transport sector were developed with ADB assistance and\ninclude (i) adequately maintaining transport infrastructure to support the reform of the economy;\n(ii)  privatizing  transport  operations  and  promoting  competition  among  operators,  while\naddressing safety and environmental concerns; and (iii) increasing cost recovery from the users\nof transport infrastructure. To achieve these objectives, the Government's strategy includes (i)\nincreasing  the  financial  provision  for  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  the  road  network;  (ii)\nconsolidating  road  sector  responsibilities  under  MOTC;  (iii)  promoting  private  sector\nparticipation in road maintenance; (iv) completing the privatization of road transport operations\nand dismantling of licensing controls, which hinder competition; (v) promoting, in collaboration\nwith neighboring countries, rail transport as the most efficient means of transporting bulk loads\nover  long  distances;  (vi)  privatizing  lake  shipping  services;  (vii)  promoting  civil  aviation\ninfrastructure and supporting services that encourage foreign and local airline operations; and\n(viii) increasing road sector revenues through appropriate pricing and taxation.\n                  \n10 The  19  permanent  members  of  the  Paris  Club  comprise  governments  holding  large  debt  owed  by  other\ngovernments. All Paris Club decisions on debt rescheduling require a consensus among the participating debtor and\ncreditor countries. Debt rescheduling agreements also require debtor countries to implement reforms to prevent\nfuture debt repayment difficulties.", "8\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n27. ADB is playing a leading role in providing policy advice, capacity building, and capital\nfinancing for the Kyrgyz road sector. ADB\u2019s first and second loans of $50 million each, with\ncofinancing  of  about  $28  million  and  $41  million,  respectively,  from  the  Japan  Bank  for\nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), have helped the Government rehabilitate part of the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh road (footnotes 3 and 9). In addition, ADB has provided six TA grants totaling $3.64\nmillion.11 The World Bank approved a $22 million loan for the Urban Transport Project in August\n2000 to rehabilitate urban roads in Bishkek, Jalal\u2013Abad, and Osh. The Islamic Development\nBank (IDB) approved $9 million in 1998 to rehabilitate the Jalal\u2013Abad\u2013Uzgen section of the\nBishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  a  short  bypass,  and  grant  assistance  for  a  feasibility  study  of\nrehabilitating a section of the Bishkek\u2013Naryn\u2013Torugart road. ADB, JBIC, and IDB complement\neach other in rehabilitating the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, and this cooperation will continue under the\nProject.\nD. Lessons Learned\n28. For the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, ADB has financed two projects that are rehabilitating priority\nsections of the road and have supported policy reform and institutional strengthening, thereby\nimproving the efficiency and safety of the country\u2019s principal road transport corridor. The civil\nworks for the first project began in September 1996, and the project was physically completed in\nJuly 2001, or 21 months later than the original project completion date. The overall delay is due to\na nine\u2013month delay in procuring and awarding the civil works contract, and to a one\u2013year delay in\nexecuting the works. All the loan covenants for the first project have been fully or partly complied\nwith. The civil works for the second project began in March 1999, and overall progress of the\nADB\u2013financed civil works is about 60 percent. The original loan closing date has not been\nextended; however, physical completion may not occur until three months after the original project\ncompletion  date,  due  to  the  delay  in  the  detailed  design  of  the  tunnel  works.  All  the  loan\ncovenants have been complied with, except for the loan covenant that requires establishing a\nseparate road fund account, which was waived by ADB on 14 July 2001 (para. 35).\n29. ADB's experience with the ongoing road rehabilitation projects in the Kyrgyz Republic\ndemonstrates  that  skills  are  available  to  implement  technically  uncomplicated  infrastructure\nprojects supervised by international consultants, and highlights the need for investments to be\naccompanied  by  comprehensive  support  for  policy  reform,  institutional  strengthening,  and\nsignificant consultant assistance. These lessons have been taken into account in designing the\nproposed Project.\nE. ADB's Operational and Sector Strategy\n30. The main objectives of ADB's strategy12 for the Kyrgyz Republic are to (i) support the\nGovernment\u2019s reform activities and strengthen its development management by encouraging\ninstitutional change, strengthening institutional capacity, and improving the provision of public\nservices; (ii) encourage the creation of a new structure for output and capacity by the private\nsector through investment and job creation; and (iii) enhance the long\u2013term potential of the\ncountry by investing in physical infrastructure and human development as well as selective\n                  \n11 TA 2256\u2013KGZ: Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 21 December 1994; TA 2587\u2013KGZ\n(footnote 7) TA 2760\u2013KGZ: Second Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 11 February 1997; TA\n3065\u2013KGZ: (footnote 8); TA 3335\u2013KGZ (footnote 1), and TA 3531-KGZ: Improvement of the Road Sector Efficiency,\nfor $440,000, approved on 31 October 2000.\n12 Country Assistance Plan: Kyrgyz Republic (2001\u20132003), December 2000.", "9\ninterventions to protect and rehabilitate the environment. To maximize the impact of ADB\u2019s\nlimited resources and in consultation with the Government and other aid agencies, ADB\u2019s\nactivities are focusing on (i) improved provision of public services, particularly those provided by\nlocal governments; (ii) agriculture, including rural finance; (iii) human development; and (iv)\ninfrastructure,  especially  rehabilitation  projects  to  preserve  the  economic  utility  of  the  past\ninvestment in the road sector.\n31. ADB\u2019s transport sector strategy supports the Government\u2019s ongoing economic transition\nto a market\u2013driven economy by assisting in (i) developing an efficient policy and regulatory\nframework; (ii) corporatizing/commercializing and, where appropriate, privatizing operations of\nstate\u2013owned  enterprises;  (iii)  promoting  competition  and  private  sector  participation  in  the\nproviding and operating of road infrastructure facilities and services; (iv) improving road funding\nby improving tax and duties collection, developing a user\u2013pays approach to road funding, and\nremoving subsidy\u2013induced distortions in pricing of transport services; (v) rehabilitating and\nimproving operation, maintenance, and safety standards of the road network; (vi) developing\nhuman resources; and (vii) improving environmental standards. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road\nsector since 1996 through the first and second road rehabilitation projects has been guided by\nits sector strategy and has been instrumental in improving the policy and regulatory framework,\ninstitutional strengthening of MOTC and other sector institutions, preparing a road maintenance\nplan, and mobilizing additional resources from other agencies.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n32. ADB's ongoing projects have helped the Government implement reforms in the areas of\npolicy and regulatory framework, institutional strengthening and capacity development, road\nsector  funding  and  cost  recovery,  road  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  The  policy  issues\ndiscussed and agreed upon with the Government during project processing strengthen and\ncomplement  the  earlier  initiatives  (Appendix  4).  The  policy  dialogue  focused  on  poverty\nreduction, competitiveness of markets for transport services, financing of road maintenance,\nroad maintenance practices, and MOTC financial management reform.\n1.  Poverty Reduction\n33. Poverty  has  been  a  major  issue  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  since  independence.  The\nGovernment is committed to reducing poverty, and the national strategy for poverty reduction is\nbeing prepared with ADB assistance. In addition to improving the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, the Project\nwill also improve secondary roads in areas with high poverty levels.13 MOTC was extensively\ninvolved in selecting the secondary roads for the Project. The Government agreed to provide its\nshare of funds for the secondary road component of the Project and to encourage the active\nparticipation  of  the  project  beneficiaries,  e.g.,  through  community\u2013based  maintenance  of\nsecondary roads.\n2.  Competitiveness of Markets for Transport Services\n34. The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  made  substantial  progress  over  the  last  few  years  in\ncommercializing transport enterprises; however, the Government still has substantial influence\nin  the  markets  for  transport  services,  for  example,  through  Government  ownership  of  bus\n                  \n13  The secondary roads included in the Project connect the Bishkek\u2013Osh road with poor villages that are primarily\ndependent on agriculture. These roads have a mix of earth, gravel, and deteriorated pavement surfaces. In terms of\nwidth, they are classified as categories IV and V (para. 7).", "10\nstations and licensing and other regulations (paras. 14\u201316). Increased competitiveness of the\nmarkets for transport services is necessary to improve transport services for all inhabitants of\nthe project area and ensure that the reductions in transport costs are passed on to transport\nusers. The Government has agreed that the TA associated with the Project will include a\ncomponent to analyze the markets for transport services and give recommendations to improve\nthe competitiveness of the markets so as to maximize the poverty reduction impact of the\nProject. The TA will also study the impact of the measures to increase competitiveness on the\npoorest part of the population, and any additional measures to ensure that the poorest are not\nnegatively  affected  by  regulatory  changes  or  other  proposed  measures.  The  Government\nagreed  to  implement  the  regulatory  changes  recommended  by  the  TA,  and  which  are\nacceptable to ADB, for improving the competitiveness of the markets for transport services to\nensure that the project benefits are passed on to the poor (para. 80).\n3.  Financing of Road Maintenance\n35. The  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  included  loan  covenants  related  to  the\noperation of the road fund, which were designed to ensure adequate and sustainable financing\nof  road  maintenance.  The  Government  has  made  significant  progress  on  this  issue,  i.e.,\ncollecting road user charges specified in the Road Fund Act and hiring independent auditors to\naudit  collection  of  these  revenues.  However,  the  covenant  requiring  establishment  of  a\nseparate,  dedicated  account  for  the  road  fund  has  not  been  complied  with.  While  the\nGovernment is aware of the importance of this issue, it is presently unable to comply with the\ncovenant. Establishing dedicated accounts outside the Government's consolidated budget will\nnot be prudent in light of the Government's current fiscal difficulties (para. 17). In view of this, a\nseparate dedicated road fund account is considered premature and accordingly ADB waived\nthis covenant. The collection of road user charges in accordance with the Road Fund Act will\ncontinue.\n36. To provide for adequate financing of road maintenance, the Government has agreed to\nloan covenants mandating specific budget allocations for maintaining (i) the Bishkek\u2013Osh road,\nand  (ii)  all  other  roads  under  the  jurisdiction  of  MOTC.14  These  covenants  indicate  the\nGovernment's  commitment  to  provide  adequate  financing  for  road  maintenance.  MOF  will\nestablish a separate budget item for maintaining the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and will allocate funding\nfor  maintaining  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  other  roads  under  MOTC  administration  in  the\namounts shown in Table 1. The amounts are sufficient for conducting routine maintenance on\nthe  rehabilitated  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  and  other  MOTC  roads  and  represent\nsubstantial increases over current levels. MOF will adjust these allocations to compensate for\nthe effects of inflation and depreciation of the som against the dollar. Independent auditors will\naudit the expenditures for road maintenance annually.\nTable 1: Allocations for Maintenance\n(Som million)\nRoads 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n1.

Road Maintenance Practices\n37. Under  the  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project,  MOTC  prepared  and  began\nimplementing the road maintenance system for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, invited bids from local\ncontractors to undertake routine road maintenance on a section of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, and\nestablished the equipment pool (para. 24). The Government recognizes the need to give high\npriority to road maintenance and has agreed to expand road maintenance capacity building.\nUnder the proposed Project, MOTC will invite bids from contractors, regardless of ownership, for\nroutine  maintenance  on  all  sections  of  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  for  which  the  construction\ncontractor's  warranty  period  has  expired.  Policy  dialogue  under  the  ongoing  projects  has\nfocused on maintaining national roads. The proposed Project will improve secondary roads\nalong with sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, and will extend improved road maintenance\npractices to secondary roads as well. The advisory TA will develop a system for maintaining\nsecondary roads based on collaboration between the LMUs and local communities, which will\nhelp ensure that the poverty\u2013reduction benefits of improving secondary roads will be sustained.\nMOTC has agreed to ensure the maintenance of secondary roads rehabilitated under the\nProject by preparing the LMUs assigned to the Project\u2019s secondary roads to operate the new\nmaintenance system, including procuring appropriate maintenance equipment and enacting or\nmodifying any necessary regulations (para. 80).\n5.  MOTC Financial Management Reform\n38. ADB's ongoing projects have assisted the Government in making substantial progress in\nrestructuring MOTC to improve its efficiency in managing the transport sector. However, there\nremains  additional  scope  for  institutional  reform  to  further  improve  efficiency.  The  current\norganizational structure of financial management in MOTC is designed for historical functions of\noversight, rather than the needs of management in a market environment. MOTC's current\nfinancial management structure was studied under the TA for Policy Support in the Transport\nSector (footnote 8). Recommendations for improvement include appointing a chief financial\nofficer to head MOTC\u2019s financial management and planning functions, integrating the financial\nplanning and management functions of MOTC and the RRMAs, and starting implementation of\ninternational accounting standards. MOTC has agreed to implement these changes, which will\nintegrate and ensure the consistency of its financial reporting; improve the effectiveness of\nfinancial  management;  and  increase  the  usefulness  of  financial  reporting  for  planning,\nbudgeting, and other management decision making (para. 80).\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n39. The Kyrgyz Republic has two main centers of population, trade, and industrial activity:\nBishkek, the capital, in the north of the country, and Osh, in the southwest, at the eastern end of\nthe  Fergana  valley.  The  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  provides  the  only  internal  surface  connection\nbetween these two national centers. The road passes through four of the country's seven\nregions and serves over two million people, almost half the country's population. The Bishkek\u2013\nOsh road is vital for integrating the Kyrgyz economy, providing markets for agricultural produce\nfrom Osh and Jalal\u2013Abad provinces, and strengthening social and cultural links among the Kyrgyz\nRepublic's population groups. In addition to being the most important domestic transport corridor,\nthe road is also important from a regional perspective: it comprises part of the transnational route\nlinking Tajikistan and the agriculturally productive Fergana valley in Uzbekistan to Almaty and", "12\nRussia. In addition, the northernmost section forms part of the Almaty\u2013Bishkek\u2013Tashkent road,\nwhich is also an important regional transport corridor.\n40. ADB has been involved in the Kyrgyz road sector since 1996. The Project would be the\nthird phase of a rehabilitation program for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road,15 which has a total length of\nabout 650 km. The two ongoing projects are rehabilitating the central, mountainous sections of\nthe road (from km 81 to km 426), which are in the most advanced state of deterioration and\nhave the worst safety conditions. The proposed Project will rehabilitate the most deteriorated of\nthe remaining sections of the road in the project area in Jalal\u2013Abad and Osh provinces, as well as\nsecondary roads.\n41. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest of the CARs. About 52 percent of the\npopulation are estimated to be living in poverty (unable to afford a minimum consumption\nbasket), and about 18 percent are estimated to be living in extreme poverty (unable to obtain a\nminimum diet). About 73 percent of people in the project area are estimated to be poor, and\nabout 28 percent are estimated to be extremely poor. The Project will reduce poverty by\nlowering transport costs for road users and by improving market access for farmers in Jalal\u2013\nAbad,  who  no  longer  have  access  to  their  traditional  markets  in  Uzbekistan.  In  addition,\nimproving the secondary roads will improve access to markets, employment opportunities, and\nmore  comprehensive  health  facilities  for  a  large  number  of  people.  The  Project  will  also\ngenerate employment for local poor people during the rehabilitation works.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n42. The  Project  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  by\nreducing the cost of road transport and improving access to markets in the Bishkek\u2013Osh\ncorridor. The Project will rehabilitate the most deteriorated of the remaining sections of the road\nlinking Bishkek and Osh and will improve market access for agricultural producers in Jalal\u2013Abad\nprovince. The Project will support reforms in the road sector to improve road maintenance and\nto provide a sustainable source and adequate level of financing for road maintenance.\n2.  Scope\n43. The Project comprises\n(i) rehabilitation of about 120 km of the 650 km two\u2013lane national highway from\nBishkek to Osh, in particular, km 427\u2013498 in Jalal\u2013Abad province (72 km) and\nthe Uzgen\u2013Osh section in Osh province (48 km), including safety features;\n(ii) improvement of about 125 km of secondary roads in Jalal\u2013Abad (Tash Kumyr\u2013\nKara  Djigadz  and  Bazar  Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\u2013Kyzyl  Ungkur)  feeding  into  the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road;\n                  \n15 The Road Rehabilitation Project (footnote 9) assisted the Government in rehabilitating 135 km of key sections of the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road. JBIC provided parallel cofinancing of $28 million for civil works, consulting services, and\nmaintenance  equipment.  The  Second  Road  Rehabilitation  Project  (footnote  3)  assisted  the  Government  in\nrehabilitating another 208 km of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. JBIC again provided parallel cofinancing of $40.8 million for\ncivil works and consulting services.", "13\n(iii) consulting services for construction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and\nimplementation of reforms in road maintenance practices; and\n(iv) procurement of light, hand\u2013operated equipment and truck\u2013mounted cranes for\nroutine maintenance of the selected secondary roads and the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.\n44. In  addition,  an  accompanying  advisory  TA  will  develop  a  system  for  maintaining\nsecondary  roads  through  the  collaboration  of  the  LMUs  and  local  communities  and  will\nrecommend measures to improve the competitiveness of markets for transport services (paras.\n68\u201370).\nC. Technical Justification\n45. The existing Bishkek\u2013Osh road was designed and constructed mostly during the 1960s\naccording to FSU standards; however, construction of the road did not strictly follow the design\nand the quality was substandard. As a result, the road suffers from frost damage, and the\nasphalt pavement has worn out. The road has further deteriorated with the collapse of the FSU\nand subsequent disintegration of the road maintenance organizations. Safety conditions on the\nroad  are  poor.  The  road  passes  through  many  villages  in  which  there  are  no  pedestrian\nwalkways or facilities for nonmotorized and light vehicles.\n46. The sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be included in the Project consist of two lanes\nand are the most deteriorated of the sections not covered by other projects. The first 30 km of\nthe km 427\u2013498 section pass through steep slopes along the Naryn River and are prone to\nlandslides, flash floods, and severe erosion. Many existing culverts on this section are too small\nto ensure sufficient drainage and become clogged during heavy rains. The works for the first 30\nkm of the km 427\u2013498 section include rehabilitating the pavement structures (base course and\npavement), improving the drainage structures, repairing damaged culverts and bridges, and\nconstructing protective structures against rockfalls, landslides, and erosion. The works on the\nrest of the km 427\u2013498 section consist of rehabilitating the pavement and repairing drainage\nstructures. On the Uzgen\u2013Osh section, similar pavement rehabilitation and drainage repair\nworks will be implemented. In addition, pedestrian walkways will be added and traffic safety\ninstallations will be improved.\n47. The present traffic levels on the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be rehabilitated\nunder the Project vary from a low of about 1,300 vehicles per day in the km 427\u2013498 section to\na high of about 4,600 vehicles per day in the Uzgen\u2013Osh section. Traffic levels for heavy\nvehicles range from a low of about 470 trucks per day in the km 427\u2013498 section to a high of\nabout 670 trucks per day in the Uzgen\u2013Osh section. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type have been\nprepared for the 2002\u20132024 period for the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be rehabilitated\n(Appendix 5). The forecasts are based on expected growth in GDP and population and the\nelasticity of demand for freight and passenger traffic. Some additional traffic is expected to be\ngenerated as a result of lower transport costs arising from the Project. The projected average\nannual growth rates for passenger traffic are 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 7.0 percent during\n2006\u20132010, and 6.5 percent for the remaining project period. Freight traffic is expected to grow\nat rates of 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 6.5 percent during 2006\u20132010, and 6.0 percent during\nthe remaining project period.\n48. The two secondary roads included in the Project are in poor condition and will be\nrehabilitated  to  different  standards  appropriate  to  each  section.  On  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013Kara\nDjigadz road (53 km), the first 15 km will be rehabilitated by repairing the existing bituminous", "14\npavement. The works on the km 16\u201353 section of this road will comprise building a proper\nembankment and constructing a bituminous gravel pavement. The Bazar Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\nroad (52 km) and its branch to Kyzyl Ungkur (20 km) will be rehabilitated by repairing the\nbituminous pavement of the first 10 km and laying a gravel surface on the remainder of the road\nto Arslanbob, with improvements to the earth road and bridge on the branch to Kyzyl Ungkur. In\naddition, damaged culverts and bridges along the length of this road will be repaired or rebuilt.\nD. Cost Estimates\n49. The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $50  million  equivalent  (including  physical\ncontingencies, price escalation, interest and other charges during construction, but excluding\nthe VAT and other taxes, of which $30.6 million (61.2 percent) is the foreign exchange cost. The\nlocal currency costs are estimated at $19.4 million equivalent, or 38.8 percent of the total cost.\nThe cost estimates are summarized in Table 2, with details in Appendix 6.\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n50. The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan from its Special Funds resources\nin an amount equivalent to $40 million to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $9.4\nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB financing of a portion of the local currency cost\nis justified due to the Government's budget constraints, the heavy external debt burden, and the\ncountry's severe poverty. The Project will have a strong pro\u2013poor growth impact. In view of\nthese reasons, provision of local cost financing for this Project is reasonable. The ADB loan will\nrepresent 80 percent of the total cost of the Project including contingencies and interest charge\non the loan during construction. The terms and conditions of the loan will be ADB\u2019s standard\nterms and conditions for loans from its Special Funds resources. The ADB loan will have a\nmaturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0 percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  during  the  remaining  period.  The\nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost. The Borrower will be the Kyrgyz", "15\nRepublic. The Government has given its assurance that adequate local counterpart funds will be\nmade available from the State budget or other sources as necessary to enable the Project to be\nimplemented in a timely manner. In case of escalation of prices or required quantities covered\nby contingencies, the increase will be shared by the Government and ADB according to the\nfinancing percentages of the overall project cost, with ADB's share in the total cost limited to the\nmaximum loan amount. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 3 with details in\nAppendix 6.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 30.6   9.4 40.0   80\nGovernment   0.0 10.0 10.0   20\nTotal 30.6 19.4 50.0 100\nF. The Executing Agency\n51. MOTC will be the Executing Agency for the Project and will be responsible for overall\nproject  management,  including  planning,  managing,  supervising,  and  coordinating\nimplementation.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Organization and Management\n52. The project steering committee (PSC) overseeing the work for the two ongoing projects\nwill also oversee the work for the proposed Project. The PSC will (i) oversee and coordinate all\nproject activities, including liaison among the consultants and the agencies involved in project\nimplementation and sector reforms, as agreed upon during policy dialogue with ADB; (ii) review\nthe status of the implementation of project components; (iii) monitor the progress achieved and\nresolve difficulties encountered; and (iv) serve as a forum for discussions on, and review of, the\nProject's impact on poverty reduction and economic development. The PSC is chaired by the\nminister of MOTC. Its members include the project manager and representatives from the Prime\nMinister's Office, MOF, and MOTC. The PSC will meet at least four times a year, and more\noften if required.\n53. The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  presently  administering  ADB's  ongoing  road\nprojects will also be responsible for implementing the proposed Project. As both the first and\nsecond projects should be completed by the end of 2002, the PIU will have sufficient capacity to\nimplement  the  proposed  Project.  The  PIU,  assisted  by  the  international  and  domestic\nconsultants to be recruited for construction supervision, will undertake day\u2013to\u2013day supervision\nof  project  implementation  and  provide  the  necessary  liaison  among  MOTC,  contractors,\nsuppliers, and ADB. In particular, the PIU will be responsible for procuring goods and services,\nrecruiting consultants, making disbursements, and reporting.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n54. The Project will be implemented in a little more than three years. Advance procurement\nactivities are expected to begin in September 2001, and construction completed by 31 October\n2004. The secondary road improvement component will be implemented over a period of 1.5", "16\nyears during the last two years of the Project. The proposed implementation schedule is in\nAppendix 7. This schedule is considered attainable as only a small section of the project road is\nin mountainous terrain and subject to severe winter weather limitations.\n3.  Procurement\n55. All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All contracts for civil works and contracts valued in excess\nof $500,000 for goods will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). Supply\ncontracts not exceeding $500,000 will be procured through international shopping. Civil works\nfor rehabilitating the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and the secondary roads will be packaged into three\ncontracts  each.  All  six  civil  works  contracts  will  follow  ICB  procedures  to  encourage  the\nparticipation  of  international  competitors  and  joint  ventures  by  international  and  domestic\ncontractors. Supply contracts for the equipment will be grouped into three packages based on\nthe technical requirements. These packages will be finalized during project implementation. The\ntentative contract packages are listed in Appendix 8.\n4.  Consulting Services\n56. International consulting services totaling 51 person\u2013months will be provided for (person\u2013\nmonths are in parentheses) construction supervision (47) and project impact monitoring and\nevaluation (4). The international consultants will give on\u2013the\u2013job training to the counterpart staff\nand  domestic  consultants.  In  association  with  the  international  consultant  inputs,  domestic\nconsulting services (300) will be provided for construction supervision, contract management,\nand  other  technical  advisory  assistance  (270);  as  well  as  for  assisting  the  international\nconsultants in monitoring the social and poverty impact of the Project through household survey\nand data analysis (30). The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants. The terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 9.\n5.  Advance Procurement and Recruitment Action\n57. During project processing, the Government requested ADB approval for advance action\nin  view  of  the  high  priority  the  Government  accords  to  the  Project  and  to  minimize\nimplementation  delays  and  ensure  timely  project  completion.  Advance  procurement  and\nrecruitment action was approved on 18 May 2001 and covers (i) prequalification of contractors,\ntendering, and bid evaluation for the civil works contract packages; and (ii) recruitment of\ninternational consultants to help implement the Project. However, it does not include the signing\nof contracts. The advance action will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government has been advised\nthat approval of the advance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n6.  Midterm Review\n58. ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review of project implementation in\n2003. The objectives will be to (i) evaluate the Government's progress in implementing policy\nreforms; (ii) examine project implementation and determine whether any adjustments to the\nscope and implementation arrangements are warranted; (iii) determine compliance with relevant\nstandards; (iv) address any potential procurement, financing, and scheduling issues; and (v)\nexamine compliance with the loan covenants.", "17\n7.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n59. MOTC  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project\nimplementation. MOTC will maintain separate accounts for all project components financed by\nADB and the Government and have them audited by an independent auditor, acceptable to\nADB, with adequate knowledge of and experience with international accounting practices. The\naudited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports will be submitted to ADB within nine months\nafter the end of each financial year. The Government has been informed of ADB\u2019s requirement\nof  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  including  the\nsuspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. The auditing services may be financed\nthrough the loan proceeds as part of project management costs (Appendix 6). To facilitate\npostevaluation of the Project, the Government has agreed to submit a project completion report\nto ADB, within three months of physical completion of the Project.\n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n60. A set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project performance in relation to its\ngoals and purposes, with emphasis on poverty reduction, has been agreed upon with MOTC\n(Appendix 10). At the start of project implementation, MOTC will establish baseline values for\nsocial, environmental, and poverty reduction impact indicators. Monitoring indicators will be\nmeasured at the necessary frequency during project implementation. Comments and findings\nregarding these project indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In\naddition to indicators for monitoring implementation, indicators for project evaluation will be\nmeasured at project completion and three years after completion. Where relevant, indicators will\nbe  disaggregated  by  gender.  Participatory  surveys  will  take  place,  and  the  results  will  be\ncompared with the baseline. A final report will evaluate the changes that occurred in the three\npreceding years. To facilitate assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impact of\nthe Project, an international consultant will be recruited to monitor and evaluate all relevant\nproject impacts. The consultant will also work with MOTC to ensure the continued monitoring of\nthe first and second projects.\n9. Anticorruption Measures\n61. The Mission explained ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy to the officials of the Government.\nThe Government is committed to creating and sustaining a corruption\u2013free environment, and\nhas agreed to abide by the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy in preparing all\ndocuments and contracts during the bidding process and during project implementation.\n10. Capacity Building and Human Resource Development\n62. The Project will build capacity and develop human resources within MOTC in the area of\nmaintenance of secondary roads. Under the advisory TA, consultants will develop a system for\nmaintaining secondary roads and will conduct workshops on the system. Subsequently, the\nsupervision  consultants  will  give  training  and  other  assistance  to  the  LMUs  and  local\ncommunities to help implement the system.", "18\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Aspects\n63. The Project is in environmental category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE)\nwas carried out under the project preparatory TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental\nAssessment  Requirements  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Projects. The IEE indicated that the Project will have no significant adverse\nenvironmental impact and that an environmental impact assessment is not necessary because\nthe Project involves mainly rehabilitation of roads on the existing alignment (except for minor\nrealignments to improve road safety) and requires no land acquisition. The Summary IEE\n(SIEE) has been prepared (Appendix 11). The Project will not have any significant negative\nimpact on the two protected nature areas located in the project area. Appropriate mitigation\nmeasures have been incorporated in the project design including adequate drainage facilities,\nerosion prevention measures, and traffic management facilities. The consultants for construction\nsupervision will assist MOTC to supervise and monitor the (i) selection and restoration of borrow\nareas and quarries, (ii) extraction of water for construction, (iii) waste management, (iv) control\nof hazardous and toxic materials, and (v) prevention of impairment of downstream water quality.\nAll the environmental mitigation measures recommended in the IEE will be implemented. The\nrelevant mitigation costs are reflected in the project costs. The Government has agreed that the\nProject will be implemented following the environmental laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines, as specified in the loan covenants (para. 80).\n2. Social Issues\n64. The sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road to be rehabilitated are located in two provinces\n(Jalal\u2013Abad and Osh) and directly affect six districts (Ak\u2013Syi, Nooken, Bazar Korgon, Suzak,\nUzgen, and Kara\u2013Suu) and four cities (Jalal\u2013Abad, Tash Kumyr, Mayluu\u2013Suu, and Osh). The\ndistricts and cities have a population of approximately 1.3 million inhabitants, of which about 73\npercent are living in poverty. This figure is much higher than the national level of 52 percent.\nThe unemployment rate is also high, and the annual per capita income is approximately $102\nequivalent,  substantially  lower  than  the  national  average  of  $124  equivalent.  Farming  and\nlivestock raising account for about one half of employment and about 40 percent of the country\u2019s\nGDP. The project area accounts for about 33 percent of the country\u2019s agricultural output and\nabout 29 percent of the industrial output.\n65. A social impact assessment was prepared, and a summary is attached as Appendix 12.\nThe Project will exclude bypasses or realignments (except for minor realignments to improve\nroad safety, which will not entail resettlement) or development of new alignments in previously\nundisturbed areas. No land will be acquired. No people will be involuntarily relocated; therefore,\nno  resettlement  action  plan  is  needed.  Ethnic  minorities  will  not  be  severely  or  adversely\naffected by the Project because of their separate cultural identity. The overall impact of the\nproject will be essentially gender neutral. Although women in construction works account for a\nvery small percentage of the overall labor employment, they will be given equal opportunity and\npay for construction and operation work during project implementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nPolicy on Gender and Development.\n66. From the conclusions of the social impact assessment, a number of measures were\nidentified to maximize the social benefits of the Project. These specific measures have been\nincorporated  in  the  project  design:  (i)  enhancing  roadside  social  infrastructure,  including", "19\nrehabilitation  of  existing  bus  shelters  and  roadside  amenities  that  come  under  MOTC's\njurisdiction; (ii) constructing pedestrian walkways and improving traffic safety installations in\nvillages  through  which  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  passes;  and  (iii)  implementing  precautionary\nmeasures against socially transmitted diseases. The rehabilitation works will also generate an\nestimated 903 person\u2013years of direct employment, including 624 person\u2013years (69 percent) for\nunskilled labor. It is expected that local residents will provide all the unskilled labor and part of\nthe skilled labor required. The Project will also stimulate the local construction materials industry\nthrough purchase of locally produced construction materials.\n67. Project impacts, particularly those relating to poverty reduction, social development, and\ngender  issues,  will  be  monitored  during  and  after  project  implementation.  The  monitoring\nsystem  will  specifically  focus  on  the  social  and  poverty  impact  of  road  rehabilitation  and\nimprovement of the secondary roads, and will provide quantitative and qualitative analyses of\nthe income levels of the poor and the distribution of project benefits to them. The monitoring\nsystem will be implemented through social and household surveys, public consultation, and\nparticipation of the project beneficiaries. A set of baseline indicators for monitoring the project\nimpacts has been agreed upon with MOTC (para. 60).\nI. Technical Assistance\n68. The Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory TA focusing on institutional\ncapacity building to maintain secondary roads and for policy support focusing on the transport\nservices markets. The TA attached to the Project will (i) assist the Government in developing\nthe capacity for maintaining secondary roads using community maintenance techniques; and (ii)\ndevelop a set of specific measures for regulatory reforms to increase the competitiveness of the\nmarkets for transport services. These measures will be based on the findings of the Policy\nSupport for the Transport Sector TA (footnote 8) and will be consistent with the national strategy\nfor poverty reduction.\n69. The  TA  will  require  17  person\u2013months  of  international  and  40  person\u2013months  of\ndomestic consulting services with expertise in road maintenance engineering, financing, and\ntraining; and also in economics of transport markets and transport sector policy reform. The total\ncost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $770,000  equivalent  including  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n$505,500 and a local currency cost of $264,500 equivalent. The Government has requested\nADB  to  provide  $650,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  local\ncurrency cost of $144,500 equivalent. The Government will finance the balance of the local\ncurrency cost of $120,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The terms of reference for the\nconsultants and the cost estimates are in Appendix 13.\n70. MOTC will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will be responsible for the day\u2013to\u2013\nday  implementation  activities  including  liaison  and  coordination  with  other  concerned\nGovernment departments or agencies. The TA will be implemented in nine months starting from\nJuly 2002. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.", "20\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n71. Economic analysis for the project road sections was carried out by comparing with\u2013 and\nwithout\u2013project scenarios (Appendix 14). The principal sources of economic benefits for the\nProject are the savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs), time savings, benefits arising from\ngenerated traffic, and economic value added. VOC savings account for the bulk of total benefits\nand arise from the improved road surface resulting from the civil works carried out under the\nProject. The VOCs are calculated for each vehicle type comprising traffic on the road sections.\nThe Project will also improve safety conditions and induce economic development by improving\naccess to and lowering the costs of transport to the principal domestic markets for agricultural\nand industrial goods produced in the project area. By improving secondary roads, the Project\nwill improve the access of the poor to markets and health services. Improved access to markets\nwill generate economic value added in the form of increased agricultural production in the areas\nalong the secondary roads. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is\nestimated at 19.3 percent and the net present value at $28.2 million. The Project will also\nbenefit road users in other countries of the region, for example, through reduced transport costs\nfor shipments of fresh produce from Uzbekistan to Russia. Since these benefits do not accrue to\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, they are not included in the EIRR. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to\ntest the effects of negative changes in the key parameters that determine the costs and benefits\nof the Project. The analysis indicates that costs would have to increase by 77 percent or\nbenefits decrease by 43.5 percent to bring the EIRR down to the cutoff level of 12 percent.\nGiven MOTC's experience with similar projects and the relatively straightforward nature of the\nrehabilitation works, such changes are unlikely to occur.\nB. Impact on Poverty\n72. A poverty impact assessment comprising a detailed analysis of the poverty situation in\nthe  project  area  and  the  project  impact  on  poverty  was  prepared  (Appendix  15).  Using\nparticipatory  rapid  appraisal  techniques,  surveys  of  passengers,  drivers  of  freight  and\npassenger vehicles, households, and local officials were conducted in the six districts of the\nproject area. Agriculture is the primary economic activity although there is some concentrated\nindustrial activity, primarily hydroelectric power stations and minerals extraction and processing.\nAgriculture, including harvesting of natural resources, is also the primary economic activity\nalong the secondary roads included in the Project, with some tourism and mining activity in\nspcecific locations.\n73. Both provinces comprising the project area have levels of per capita income lower than\nthe  national  average.  Poverty  incidence  in  Jalal\u2013Abad  is  substantially  above  the  national\naverage, while in Osh it is about the same as the national average. Poverty incidence in the six\ndistricts ranges from 46 percent to 95 percent, with poverty in five of the six above the national\nlevel of 52 percent. Poverty incidence in the four cities in the project area ranges from 38\npercent to 85 percent; with two above and two below the national level. Overall, about 73\npercent (almost 1.0 million) of the approximately 1.3 million inhabitants in the project area are\nliving  in  poverty.  This  percentage  is  substantially  higher  than  the  national  average  of  52.\nApproximately 28 percent of the project area inhabitants are classified as extremely poor,\ncompared with 18 percent nationally. Surveys show that 73 percent of the passengers using the\nproject sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are poor.", "21\n74. The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  by  rehabilitating  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  improving\nsecondary roads, and introducing policy and regulatory reforms. VOCs contribute to the high\ntransport fares charged on the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and the project secondary roads. The largest\nsource of direct economic benefits will be the reduced VOCs on the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. The\nadvisory TA accompanying the Project will develop recommendations for regulatory reforms to\nincrease  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport  services  and  ensure  that  the  VOC\nreductions will be substantially passed on to the road users. The Government has agreed to\nimplement the TA recommendations (para. 80).\n75. The Project will improve secondary roads providing access from the Bishkek\u2013Osh road\nto adjacent areas with high incidence of poverty. Two secondary roads with a total length of 125\nkm  will  be  improved:  (i)  the  Tash  Kumyr\u2013Kara  Djigadz  road,  and  (ii)  the  Bazar  Korgon\u2013\nArslanbob road and its branch to Kyzyl Ungkur. The secondary roads were carefully selected\nfrom  an  initial  group  of  approximately  2,000  km  through  an  evaluation  process  involving\nextensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders during site visits. The criteria for\nselecting the secondary roads included (i) population density and number of settlements served\nby the roads, (ii) poverty incidence, (iii) economic potential, (iv) potential improvement of access\nto social services and employment opportunities, (v) traffic volume, and (vi) environmental\nimpact. Improving these secondary roads will improve the poor inhabitants' access to markets\nfor  their  agricultural  produce,  employment  opportunities,  and  more  comprehensive  health\nfacilities. Improved access to markets is particularly important as it will enable farmers to\nincrease agricultural production for sale in markets that require travel on the project roads.\n76. The project design has specific measures to maximize the poverty reduction impact. To\nensure that the reduced VOC savings are passed on to the poor, the Project will increase the\ncompetitiveness of markets for transport services by implementing regulatory reforms to be\nidentified under the advisory TA. The TA will also recommend measures to ensure that these\nreforms do not adversely affect the poorest segment of the population. The Project will support\nlocal procurement of goods and services as well as local employment generation for skilled and\nunskilled labor, and will ensure that local employees receive wages above the poverty level. The\nProject  will  also  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  poor  through  employment  generation.  The\nrehabilitation works will generate substantial employment for local labor services during the\nimplementation period (para. 66). The Project will also stimulate the local construction materials\nindustry by locally procuring construction materials for the civil works.\n77. The Project benefits were analyzed to determine the poverty reduction impact. The\npoverty impact ratio for the quantifiable benefits of the rehabilitated Bishkek\u2013Osh road and\nsecondary roads was calculated at 53 percent. However, due to the non\u2013specific nature of the\nbeneficiaries and the inability to guarantee that the Project's benefits will be passed on to the\npoor, the Project's poverty classification is other with a thematic priority of economic growth.\nC. Project Risks\n78. The risks to achieving the road rehabilitation targets include (i) delay in implementation,\n(ii) inadequate capacity for implementation such as weak technical and managerial expertise,\n(iii) poor construction quality, (iv) safety risks during and after project implementation, and (v)\ninadequate provision of counterpart funds. The Project has been formulated to reduce these\npotential risks through use of advance procurement and recruitment action, preparation of\ndetailed design prior to project inception, use of ICB procedures for all contract packages,\nmonitoring  and  testing  by  the  international  supervision  consultants,  and  policy  dialogue  to\nensure  the  provision  of  the  budget  allocations  required  for  project  implementation.  The", "22\nGovernment has agreed that MOTC and MIA will take all necessary measures to ensure the\nsafety of project workers and road users, including implementation of proper traffic management\nprocedures,  and  will  implement  in  a  timely  manner  all  agreed\u2013upon  recommendations  for\nmaintaining safety made by the contractor, supervision consultant, and ADB (para. 80).\n79. The poverty reduction aspects of the Project are also subject to risks: (i) savings in\ntransport costs may not be passed on to the transport users, especially the poor; (ii) access to\ntransport services in poor areas may not improve; (iii) local labor may not be employed to the\nextent anticipated; and (iv) the secondary roads may not be properly maintained. The project\ndesign includes measures to address these potential risks. The advisory TA will recommend\nspecific measures to improve the competitiveness of markets for transport services to ensure\nthat savings in transport costs are passed on to the users. The loan covenants require that\nthese measures be implemented. The TA recommendations will also include measures to\nstimulate increased frequency of transport services to poor areas, especially those along the\nsecondary roads. The consulting services under the Project will monitor the use of local labor by\ncontractors to ensure that it is used to the extent possible. The advisory TA will prepare a road\nmaintenance system based on collaboration between the LMUs and local communities. The\nloan covenants will require implementation of this system on the secondary roads rehabilitated\nby the Project.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nII. \n80. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Project  counterpart  funding.  The  Government  will  provide  all  funds  and\nresources necessary for rehabilitating, operating and maintaining, and managing\nthe Bishkek\u2013Osh road and the secondary roads included in the Project.

Estimates of current traffic levels are based on data from the Ministry of Transport and\nCommunications and on the consultant's moving-observer counts during the project preparatory\ntechnical assistance.1 Average annual daily traffic (AADT) is estimated at about 1,300 vehicles\nper  day  on  the  km  427\u2013498  section  and  about  4,600  on  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section.  Traffic\ncomprises seven vehicle types: cars, pickups, buses, and four types of trucks. Cars are the\nmajority accounting for 50 percent on the km 427\u2013498 section and 69 percent on the Uzgen\u2013\nOsh section.\n2. Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2001\u2013\n2024 (Table A5). The forecasts are based on expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand population, and on income elasticities of demand for freight and passenger traffic. The\npopulation is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 1.7 percent per year during the\nproject period. GDP is forecast to grow at annual rates of 4.5 percent through 2005, and 5.0\npercent thereafter. The values of income elasticity of demand used for passenger traffic are 1.5\nduring 2001\u20132005, 1.4 during 2006\u20132010, and 1.3 for the remaining project period. For freight\ntraffic, the values used are 1.5 during 2001\u20132005, 1.3 during 2006\u20132010, and 1.2 during the\nremaining project period.\n3. The average annual growth rates for passenger traffic are 6.8 percent during 2001\u2013\n2005, 7.0 percent during 2006\u20132010, and 6.5 percent for the remaining project period. For\nfreight traffic, the average annual growth rates are 6.8 percent during 2001\u20132005, 6.5 percent\nduring 2006\u20132010, and 6.0 percent for the remaining project period. Traffic levels on the km\n427\u2013498 section are forecast to increase to an AADT of about 5,300 in 2024, while AADT on\nthe Uzgen\u2013Osh section will increase to almost 21,000 by 2024. Generated traffic resulting from\nlower transport costs comprises approximately 10 percent of total traffic. International transit\ntraffic is forecast to comprise approximately 5 percent of total traffic.\nTable A5: Traffic Forecast for the Project\n(Average Annual Daily Traffic)\nRoad Section Light Medium Heavy Articulated\nand Year Car Pickup Bus Truck Truck Truck Truck Total\nKm 427-498\n2001         663      146 47 20 60 312 80     1,328\n2005         644      201 85 30 80 414 103     1,557\n2010         926      288 123 30 111 579 145     2,202\n2015      1,290      400 170 40 150 785 197     3,032\n2020      1,788      554 233 54 203 1,062 266     4,160\n2024      2,316      716 301 68 258 1,348 338     5,345\nUzgen-Osh\n2001      3,169      509 277 46 139 333 153     4,626\n2005      3,968      649 380 76 188 447 195     5,903\n2010      5,692      931 544 76 263 626 272     8,404\n2015      7,917  1,294 756 103 357 848 368   11,643\n2020   10,964  1,793    1,046 139 482 1,146 498   16,068\n2024   14,195  2,321    1,353 177 612 1,455 634   20,747\n                  \n1 TA 3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($ million)\nCost Estimates Financing Plan\n    Asian Development Bank Government\nItem Foreign Local Total Foreign Local Total Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Introduction\n1. This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) report is based primarily on the\ninformation in the initial environmental examination (IEE). The IEE was prepared under the\nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) TA 3335\u2013KGZ1 in accordance with the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB\u2019s) Environmental Assessment Requirements  and Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects. The IEE was prepared in four\nsteps:  (i)  secondary  data  and  reports  on  relevant  previous  projects  were  analyzed,  and\ndiscussions were held with the representatives of the local environmental authorities, road\nmaintenance units, and road design organizations; (ii) field investigations were conducted to\ncollect data for the Project; (iii) the data were reviewed and possible environmental impacts\nwere analyzed; and (iv) mitigation measures were designed to minimize adverse effects during\nand after construction. Additional information was obtained through a series of meetings with\ndomestic specialists, local authorities and road maintenance units, and site inspection during\nthe fact\u2013finding mission.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. The Project will rehabilitate about 120 kilometers (km) of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road and 125\nkm of secondary roads feeding into the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. The first 30 km of the km 427\u2013498\nsection pass through steep slopes along the Naryn River and are prone to landslides, flash\nfloods, and severe erosion. Many of the existing culverts on this section are too small to ensure\nsufficient drainage and become clogged during heavy rains. The works for the first 30 km of the\nkm  427\u2013498  section  include  rehabilitating  the  pavement  structures  (base  course  and\npavement), improving the drainage structures, repairing damaged culverts and bridges, and\nconstructing protective structures against rockfalls, landslides, and erosion. The works on the\nrest of the section consist of rehabilitating the pavement and repairing drainage structures. On\nthe  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section,  similar  pavement  rehabilitation  and  drainage  repair  works  will  be\nconstructed.  In  addition,  as  the  Uzgen\u2013Osh  section  passes  through  villages,  pedestrian\nwalkways will be added and traffic safety installations will be improved.\n3. The two secondary roads will be rehabilitated to different standards appropriate to each\nroad section. On the Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz road, the existing bituminous pavement of the\nfirst 15 km will be repaired. The works on the km 15\u201353 section of this road will comprise\nbuilding a proper embankment and constructing a bituminous gravel pavement. The Bazar\nKorgon\u2013Arslanbob road (52 km) and its branch to Kyzyl Ungkur (20 km) will be rehabilitated by\nrepairing  the  bituminous  pavement  of  the  first  10  km  and  laying  a  gravel  surface  on  the\nremainder of the road to Arslanbob, with improvements to the earth road and bridge on the\nbranch to Kyzyl Ungkur. In addition, damaged culverts and bridges along this road will be\nrepaired or rebuilt.\n                  \n1 TA  3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "48\nAppendix 11, page 2\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Project Area\n4. The Kyrgyz Republic is extremely mountainous and contains some of the highest and\nmost  dramatic  parts  of  the  Tien  Shan  and  Pamir  Alay  Ranges.  Its  average  elevation  is\napproximately 2,750 meters (m). The project area covers km 427\u2013498 and the section Uzgen\u2013\nOsh of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road with the Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz and Bazar Korgon\u2013Arslanbob\nsecondary roads. From km 427 to km 457, the road follows the Naryn River that descends from\nthe Toktogul reservoir toward the Fergana valley. Up to km 436 the road is carved in the steep\nand high slope above the reservoir near Tash Kumyr. In that section the road is subject to rock\nand  mud  slides  and  prone  to  erosion.  Due  to  inadequate  drainage  structures  (too  small\nculverts), the road embankment has been eroded up to km 457. The rest of the road runs over\nthe rolling foothills surrounding the Fergana valley. The secondary roads lead from Tash Kumyr\nand Bazar Korgon to the mountain villages Kara Djigadz and Arslanbob, which are popular\nrecreational areas during the summer months. Tash Kumyr is a mining town with a coal mine,\nwhich is presently working at only minimum capacity. Investigations are under way to find\ndeposits of gold and other precious metals.\n5. Soil erosion is a major environmental concern throughout the country due to seismic\nactivity, steep slopes, fragile soils, and human activities. Soil disturbance activities must also\ntake into account the fact that old biologically active disposal sites used for anthrax\u2013infected\nanimals may be unearthed during construction. Approximately 700 such sites are registered and\nmost are believed to be adjacent to the international trade roads, including the Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad.\n6. The potentially affected environment is defined as an area approximately 10 km on\neither  side  of  the  project  roads,  with  appropriate  adjustments  for  intervening  mountainous\nconditions,  international  boundaries,  and  similar  constraints,  and  with  due  consideration  of\npotential  environmental  effects  at  greater  distances  (downstream  hydrological  effects,  for\nexample). Pursuant to the ADB guidelines, the potentially affected environment is described in\nterms of its physical, biological, and human resources; economic development; and quality of\nlife characteristics.\n2.  Protected Nature Areas\n7. The two protected nature areas in the project area are the Sary Chelek Strict Nature\nPreserve  and  the  Dashman  Forest  Protected  Area.  They  are  in  the  area  defined  by  the\nsecondary roads, but remain some distance from the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road being\nrehabilitated. The protected areas are under the administrative oversight of the Department of\nProtected  Areas  within  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Emergency  Situations,  although  the\nDepartment is reported to have little actual authority over the areas compared to the regional\nauthorities through which the budgets are channeled.\n8. The Sary Chelek Strict Nature Preserve is in the most highly protected class of protected\nnature areas in the Kyrgyz Republic. Sary Chelek is 60 km from Tash Kumyr (and the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh road sections being rehabilitated) and 30 km from the closest point of the Tash Kumyr\u2013\nKara Djigadz secondary road. The preserve covers 23,868 hectares (ha), of which a section of\n18,080 ha is considered core area, and consists primarily of alpine forest. Some endangered\nspecies of flora and fauna are reported to inhabit the preserve. While there is not much tourism\nin  the  preserve  at  present,  in  the  1980s  as  many  as  10,000  tourists  visited  Sary  Chelek", "49\nAppendix 11, page 3\nannually. The village of Arkyt is located within the boundaries, and the population of 850 carry\nout economic activities such as grazing their animals within the preserve.\n9. The Dashman Forest Protected Area is in the least protected class of protected nature\nareas  in  the  country,  specifically,  a  protected  area  in  which  limited  economic  activity  is\npermitted. The Dashman forest is about 35 km from the sections of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road being\nrehabilitated and 3 km from the Arslanbob end of the Bazar Korgan\u2013Arslanbob\u2013Kyzyl Ungkur\nsecondary road. The only road connection to the forest from that point is almost completely\neroded. The Dashman forest covers 3,095 ha and comprises primarily a walnut forest (70\npercent) with apple (20 percent) and other trees. Sustainable economic activities are allowed\nwithin the forest, including raising of sunflowers by 185 landless people from nearby villages\nwho lease the land. More than 500 people from nearby villages have smallholdings within the\nforest and are allowed to collect walnuts during one month every year. Very few tourists visit the\nforest.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location\n10. No impacts on archaeological and historic resources; no significant adverse impacts on\nsettlement patterns, provinces, and communities; and no significant adverse impacts to aquatic\nor terrestrial ecosystems are anticipated. Little or no agricultural displacement will occur. Access\nto markets will be enhanced. Construction materials except special ones such as cable strands,\nadmixtures,  etc.,  will  be  obtained  in  and  around  the  project  area.  Embankment  soil,  fine\naggregates, coarse aggregates, and cement sources are available in or near the project area.\nThe Project will have an impact on the mineral and building material resources of the area by\nincreasing  the  rate  at  which  these  resources  are  consumed,  but  is  unlikely  to  cause  or\ncontribute significantly to their depletion. The area's potential for economic development will be\nenhanced. No adverse socioeconomic impacts on employment and income trends, or on ethnic\nminorities  within  the  area  are  foreseen.  The  Project  is  expected  to  enhance  commercial\nactivities adjacent to the existing roadways.\n2.  Environmental Impact on Protected Nature Areas\n11. The Project is not expected to have any direct impact on either the Sary Chelek Strict\nNature Preserve or the Dashman Forest Protected Area, although some indirect impacts are\nexpected. The rehabilitation of the Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz secondary road may lead to\nincreased tourism in the Sary Chelek Preserve; however, any increases are expected to be\nminor as approximately 30 km of unimproved road lies between the secondary road and the\npreserve. Any increases in tourism are expected to be within the environmental management\ncapacity of the preserve\u2019s administration, as the tourism levels would still remain well below\nthose during the 1980s. The risk of increased exploitation is expected to be minor as well, due\nto the 30 km of unimproved road, and to be within the management capacity of the preserve\u2019s\nadministration.\n12. As for the Dashman Forest Protected Area, the rehabilitation of the Bazar Korgon\u2013\nArslanbob\u2013Kyzyl  Ungkur  secondary  road  raises  issues  of  increased  tourism,  additional\nexploitation of timber, and conversion to other uses. Any increase in tourism is expected to be\nvery small, as the forest has never been a major tourist destination and the road linking the\nsecondary road to the forest is in a very bad condition. There may be some risk of additional\nexploitation of timber; however, the very poor condition of the road link from the end of the", "50\nAppendix 11, page 4\nproject road to the forest may be a deterrent. The Government is aware of this issue, and in\nrecognition of the exploitation in Dashman and other areas, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s parliament\nenacted in December 2000 a resolution proposing the suspension of walnut timber extraction\nuntil effective measures can be taken to control exports. The pressure to convert forestlands to\nother uses, e.g., agriculture, is also an issue at Dashman; however, the Project is not expected\nto increase this pressure and may in fact alleviate it by improving access to other economic\nopportunities.\n3. Environmental Problems Associated with Construction\n13. Detours and traffic inconveniences will occur during construction. After construction, the\nprimary transport impact of the Project will be to improve the performance of the transport sector\nand  greatly  facilitate  the  flow  of  traffic,  goods,  and  travelers.  Care  will  be  taken  during\nconstruction to minimize traffic disruptions. No mitigating actions related to transport, other than\nthose actions already incorporated in the Project, are considered warranted.\n14. Topographic and soil impacts could occur due to altered road embankments, borrow pit\nexcavations, and quarry operations. No significant cut\u2013and\u2013fill operations are anticipated. No\nlong\u2013term impacts to the area's soils due to increased pollutant levels are anticipated. No\nsignificant changes in hydrological characteristics are likely and no significant adverse impacts\nto surface hydrology, wetlands, groundwater characteristics, or flood/inundation characteristics\nare anticipated. Air quality impacts could occur in both the construction and operational phases,\nbut no significant violations of standards are anticipated in light of the contractual provisions\nnoted in para. 26.\n15. The feasibility study recommends that contracts include provisions to mitigate adverse\nimpacts due to altered road embankments, borrow pits, and provisions for quarry operations.\nThe Project will install drainage facilities of adequate size to accommodate foreseeable flood\nlevels and will stabilize downstream slopes with concrete, or rock gabions, or walls to prevent\nerosion. Contracts will require asphalt and hot\u2013mix plants to be located at least 500 m away\nfrom the nearest sensitive receptor (e.g., schools and hospitals). Operators will be required to\ninstall emission controls. Blasting will be carried out using carefully designed charges, and dust\u2013\ngenerating  items  will  be  conveyed  under  cover.  Road  surfaces,  excavation  areas,  and\nconstruction sites will be sprayed with water to control dust. Trucks carrying earth, sand, or\nstone will be covered with tarps to prevent spilling. Contracts will require preconstruction and\nroutine air quality monitoring.\n16. Worker camps could constitute a temporary land use change and raise issues related to\nthe maintenance of healthy living conditions and control of off\u2013site impacts, hazardous traffic\nflows at construction sites, disposal of human and construction waste, and similar issues.\n17. The feasibility study recommends that contracts require construction operators to attend\nto the health and safety of their workers, maintain and clean up campsites, and respect the\nrights  of  local  landowners.  For  land  located  outside  the  right\u2013of\u2013way  (ROW),  written\nagreements with local landowners for temporary property use will specify that sites will be\nrestored to an acceptable level within a predetermined period.\n18. Human  health  risks  associated  with  road  projects  typically  involve  issues  such  as\ntransmission of diseases along previously undeveloped corridors. In this instance, however, the\nProject involves only existing ROWs and will not open any additional corridors. Contamination", "51\nAppendix 11, page 5\nof local water supplies, air and noise pollution, and issues related to road safety and accidents\nare often associated with road projects. The improved road conditions could lead to increased\nspeeds and more severe accidents.\n19. The proposed contract specifications will prevent contamination of local water supplies\nand will control air and noise pollution. Road safety will be enhanced as a result of the road\nimprovements, improved signage, and other features incorporated in the Project. The possibility\nof higher accident rates will require greater enforcement of traffic controls and placement of\nappropriate devices such as speed bumps and traffic lights.\n20. Temporary  noise  impacts  in  the  immediate  vicinity  may  occur  due  to  construction.\nImpacts to sensitive receptors during the operational phase of the Project are expected to be\nminimal. Noise impacts during the construction phase will be mitigated through the use of\nsource controls, site controls, time and activity constraints, community awareness initiatives,\nand related activities.\n4. Environmental Problems Due to Project Operations\n21. The Project will have no direct impact on area water supply systems, raw water supplies,\narea  sewerage  systems,  energy  systems,  or  waste  disposal.  Coordination  with  concerned\nofficials and agencies is required. The Project will enhance access to recreational areas within\nthe potentially affected areas, but will have no adverse impacts on such resources.\nE. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n22. The  Ministry  of  Transportation  and  Communications  (MOTC)  will  ensure  that\nenvironmental procedures are incorporated at each stage of the work, specifically:\n(i) preparation of tender documents and contracts,\n(ii) bid reviews and awards,\n(iii) supervision of preconstruction baseline monitoring, and\n(iv)  construction supervision.\n23. MOTC  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  following  laws  of  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic are complied with:\n(i) Law on Environmental Protection,\n(ii) Law on Environmental Expertise (Environmental Assessment),\n(iii) Law on Specially Protected Nature Territories,\n(iv) Law on Animal World,\n(v) Law on Atmosphere Protection,\n(vi) Forest Code,\n(vii) Law on Highways, and\n(viii)  Law on Protection and Usage of Historical and Cultural Heritage.\n24. The feasibility study includes a recommendation for an environment/social officer for\neach rehabilitation package to ensure that environmental contract provisions are enforced.\n25. The environmental monitoring program incorporated in the project recommendations\nincludes routine site inspection and reporting related to soil and erosion control, embankment\nand erosion protection, borrow pit restoration, and water quality monitoring (including baseline", "52\nAppendix 11, page 6\nand routine periodic water quality monitoring).\nF. Findings and recommendations\n1.  Recommended Contract Provisions\n26. It is recommended that specific environmental provisions related to the following topics\nbe included in the contract documents:\n(i)  embankments and erosion prevention measures;\n(ii)  borrow pit restoration;\n(iii)  mining/quarry activities;\n(iv)  siting of construction camps and related facilities;\n(v)  siting of asphalt plants;\n(vi)  baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring;\n(vii)  other  air  quality  provisions:  open  burning  is  prohibited;  use  of  solvents  and\nvolatile  materials  will  be  approved  by  the  project\u2019s  construction  supervision\nconsultants (CSC); blasting will be carried out using controlled charges; dust\u2013\ngenerating items will be conveyed under cover; road surfaces, excavation and\nconstruction sites will be sprayed with water to control dust if deemed advisable\nby the CSC; and trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be covered with tarps\nto avoid spilling;\n(viii)  baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring;\n(ix)  baseline and routine periodic noise monitoring;\n(x)  other noise\u2013related provisions: source controls, time\u2013of\u2013day restrictions, time\nand activity constraints, and community awareness activities;\n(xi)  safety  provisions:  provisions  for  detours  and  traffic  interruptions,  blasting\nprocedures, and emergency response procedures in the event of accidents or\nnatural disasters; and\n(xii)  community relations.\n2.  Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Management\n27. The following measures for institutional strengthening to ensure sound environmental\nmanagement are recommended:\n(i)  Selected  staff  will  undergo  a  training  program  addressing  the  goals  and\ntechniques of environmental management activities in road projects. The training\nshould  be  given,  but  not  necessarily  limited,  to  contract  and  construction\nsupervision personnel at the central and provincial levels and MOTC construction\nsupervision staff, including those monitoring environmental impacts. In\u2013country,\non\u2013the\u2013job  training  is  preferred  to  external  training  to  take  into  account  the\nKyrgyz Republic's physical and administrative circumstances. The cost of training\nhas been incorporated in the project costs.\n(ii)  Staff from MOTC and the Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations should\nregularly undertake joint inspection of the environmental aspects of the Project,\nincluding  erosion  control,  and  include  the  results  of  the  inspections  in  the\nquarterly reports submitted by MOTC to ADB.", "53\nAppendix 11, page 7\nG. Conclusions\n28. The  road  works  will  have  no  adverse  environmental  consequences  if  the\nrecommendations  presented  in  the  IEE  are  complied  with,  and  an  environmental  impact\nassessment is not necessary. The road works will actually alleviate some current environmental\nproblems  affecting  the  Naryn  River  by  reducing  floods,  rockfalls,  and  mudflows  in  the\nmountainous areas along km 427\u2013457. Detailed, site\u2013specific environmental action plans will be\nincluded in each construction package under Government regulations. The action plans will be\nprepared after the tender and award of the construction contracts and will specify the locations\nof  construction  camps,  asphalt  plants,  and  other  environmentally  sensitive  aspects  of  the\nconstruction program.\n29. The following recommendations result from the IEE:\n(i) The design of the rehabilitated road will be followed, and any deviations that\noccur should consider the associated potential environmental impacts.\n (ii) The  designs  will  make  full  provision  for  incorporating  the  various  mitigation\nmeasures indicated in para. 26.\n (iii) Contract documents will include, but will not be limited to, all the appropriate\nclauses to cover the environmental protection requirements.\n (iv) Through loan covenants, provision will be made for adequate maintenance of the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road and the secondary roads.\n (v) The critical activities that have environmental impacts during project construction\nand operation should be closely monitored.\n30. The Project will not have any significant adverse environmental impacts, and all potential\nminor impacts can be mitigated to insignificant levels. The Government has agreed that the\nProject will be implemented following the environmental laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines, as specified in the loan covenants for the Project.", "54\nAppendix 12, page 1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nA.  Introduction\n1. The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  mountainous,  landlocked  country,  covering  an  area  of\napproximately 198,500 square kilometers (km2). The transition to a market economy following the\ncollapse  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  (FSU)  has  seen  increasing  levels  of  poverty,  increased\nunemployment, and decreased access to social services. Most recently the financial crisis in\nRussia in 1998 brought even greater increases in poverty levels and worsened the living standards\nof the population.\n2. The Bishkek\u2013Osh road in the southwestern part of the country links the two most important\ncities and economic centers. The Project will rehabilitate sections of the road from Bishkek to Osh\nand improve two secondary roads connecting poor villages to the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. Although the\nProject will affect much of the country directly or indirectly, the project roads are limited to Jalal\u2013\nAbad and Osh provinces. In Jalal\u2013Abad, four districts and three cities will be directly affected. The\ndistricts are Bazar Korgon, Ak\u2013Syi, Nooken, and Suzak, and the cities are Jalal\u2013Abad, Tash\nKumyr, and Mayluu\u2013Suu. In Osh, two districts (Kara Suu and Uzgen) and one city (Osh) will be\ndirectly affected. The Project will directly affect 27 percent of the total population, or about 1.3\nmillion out of 4.9 million people.\nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Country and the Project Area\n1. The Economy\n3. Even before the breakup of the FSU, the Kyrgyz Republic was one of the poorest of the\nFSU republics.  Following independence, the gross domestic product (GDP) declined by over 50\npercent in a very short time. While some economic growth resumed in 1996\u20131997, the country was\nagain  set  back  by  the  region\u2019s  financial  crisis  in  1998.  The  GDP  growth  rate  has  gradually\nincreased since then, however, and reached 5.0 percent in 2000. Economic activity is curtailed by\nUzbekistan  and  Tajikistan  closing  their  borders  at  times,  and  by  Kazakhstan  imposing  trade\nbarriers on Kyrgyz exports.\n4. Most residents of the Kyrgyz Republic derive their livelihoods from the agriculture and\nforestry  sector.  Agriculture  and  forestry  accounted  for  more  than  51  percent  of  the  Kyrgyz\nRepublic\u2019s employment in 1999, a figure that increased from about 47 percent in 1995. During the\nsame period, the sector\u2019s percentage of contribution to GDP varied considerably, ranging from a\nhigh of 46.2 in 1996 to a low of 35.9 in 1998. Employment in the industry sector, which stood at\nmore than 33 percent of total employment in 1993, fell to 17 percent in 1996.  Since that time it has\nrebounded to a 1999 level of more than 22 percent of total employment.\n5. Jalal\u2013Abad province occupies approximately 17 percent of the country, has a population\ndensity of 26 persons/km2, and comprises approximately 18 percent of the country\u2019s population.\nJalal\u2013Abad is part of the Fergana valley with a long history of agricultural productivity. The province\nhas significant industries, including the largest hydroelectric stations in the country and nearly all of\nthe oil and gas extraction and oil processing enterprises. The area is subject to frequent natural\ndisasters, particularly floods and landslides. Osh province occupies approximately 15 percent of\nthe country, has a population density of 42 persons/km2, and comprises approximately one fourth\nof  the  country\u2019s  population.  Osh  is  also  in  the  Fergana  valley  and  is  known  as  a  center  of\nagriculture (cotton, fruits, and vegetables). Its industrial output is considerably lower than that of\nJalal\u2013Abad province, while its agricultural production is higher (Table A12.1).", "55\nAppendix 12, page 2\nTable A12.1: Main Economic Indicators of Project Provinces, 2000\nIndicator Jalal\u2013Abad Osh\nRegional Population\nTotal 893,900 1,211,700\nAs percent of country 18.1 24.5\nUnemployed Population (percent) 3.3 1.8\nPer Capita Income (Som, current prices) 4,179 5,457\nAgricultural Output (percent of country) a 14.4 18.5\nIndustrial Output (percent of country) 23.2 5.7\nRegional Imports (percent of country imports) a 5.0 4.5\nRegional Exports(percent of country exports) a 7.2 6.8\na  Data are for 1999.\nSource:  National Statistics Committee, Kyrgyz Republic, 1999, 2000.\n6. Providing the Kyrgyz Republic's population with the basic minimum food requirements is an\nacute problem. The cost of food products makes up a significant part of consumer expenditures.\nThe poor, the majority of the population, spend 50 percent of their income on food. Generally, food\nexpenditures as a share of the family budget have risen because the prices of food products,\nparticularly meat and milk products and fruit, have risen more quickly than income.  As a result of\nhigh  prices,  food  consumption  by  the  population  is  insufficient  and  lower  than  established\nstandards.\n2. Ethnic Groups\n7. The Kyrgyz Republic is a multiethnic country and the project area reflects much of the\nethnic diversity. More than 100 ethnic groups are variously represented in the national population;\na dozen major groups have populations greater than 20,000. The main ethnic groups are Kyrgyz,\nRussians, and Uzbeks (Table A12.2). Other ethnic groups with substantial representation are\nGermans, Ukrainians, Tatars, Dungans, Uighurs, Kazakhs, and Tajiks. The country\u2019s changing\nethnic structure corresponds to shifts in the national economy associated with the decline of\nindustrial production. There has been an outflow of ethnic groups traditionally involved in industrial\nproduction, as well as those migrating to countries with living standards higher than those of the\nKyrgyz Republic.\nTable A12.2:  Ethnic Composition\nEthnic Groups\nLocation Kyrgyz (%) Russian (%) Uzbek (%)\nJalal\u2013Abad Province 68.9 1.3 30.7\nAk\u2013Syi District 93.3 0.4 4.9\nTash\u2013Kumyr City 82.2 4.0 8.5\nNooken District 65.1 1.1 30.5\nBazar\u2013Korgon District 57.7 0.3 40.6\nSuzak District 58.9 0.5 35.1\nJalal\u2013Abad City 44.0 7.4 37.4\nMayluu\u2013Suu City \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nOsh  Province 62.9 2.0 24.1\nUzgen District 73.0 0.6 21.7\nKara\u2013Suu District 54.2 0.3 37.2\nOsh City 43.0 5.3 43.3\nKyrgyz Republic 63.9 12.3 13.6\n\u2014 = not available.\nSource: TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "56\nAppendix 12, page 3\nC. Social Analysis\n8. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 tried to determine the priority that the\npoor place on the road rehabilitation Project among their many needs, and reached the following\nconclusions.\n1. Needs Assessment\n9. The surveys, workshops, and focus group interviews indicate that stakeholders perceive\nimprovement of the project roads as being critically important in addressing the underlying causes\nof  poverty  and  increasing  economic  development  in  the  area  and  the  country.  All  sectors\nrecognized the Bishkek\u2013Osh road as the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s premier highway and its rehabilitation\nhas flagship status among other national development projects. As the road is a vital link between\nnorth and south, stakeholders perceive its improvement as strategic and essential to promote\nnational  integration,  consolidation,  and  political  stability.  Stakeholders  regard  the  following  as\nimpact areas of the Project:\n10. Employment. Stakeholders regard the Project as a major opportunity to address in part the\nunemployment problems of local communities in the project area. The Project will generate an\nestimated 903 person\u2013years of direct employment, including 624 person\u2013years (69 percent) for\nunskilled labor for roadworks. It is expected that local residents will supply all of the unskilled labor\nand part of the skilled labor requirements of the Project. In addition to employment in roadworks,\nroad improvements are expected to create jobs through the expansion of roadside trade and\nservices, including camping and rest areas for transiting passengers and tourists and catering\nestablishments.\n11. Agricultural Benefits. Stakeholders see poor road conditions as a large problem for local\nfarmers who want to get their products to city markets. High transport costs and loss of agricultural\nproduce restrict market access and inhibit full production. The reductions in product damage\nanticipated from road improvements will provide significant savings. Lower production costs and\nexpanded marketing opportunities are also expected.\n12. Education and Health Care Services. Deficiencies in the provision of health care services\nand education exist, but mainly in terms of services and staffing. Physical facilities such as schools\nand hospitals are generally adequate. But the ability to maintain, staff, and support such facilities is\nnot adequate due to the fact that the area is still recovering from the collapse of the FSU and the\ndislocations  that  followed.  Road  improvements  are  perceived  as  contributing  to  economic\ndevelopment  and  thus  addressing  the  root  cause  of  the  problems.  The  proposed  road\nimprovements  will  contribute  to  mitigating  the  underlying  causes  of  poverty  in  the  area  by\nfacilitating economic recovery and allowing continued access to existing medical facilities and\nschools.  In the areas of the secondary roads to be improved under the Project, residents have\naccess to basic health facilities; however, improvement of the secondary roads will facilitate access\nto more comprehensive health facilities.\n13. Complement to Ongoing Poverty\u2013Reduction Efforts. Road improvements are also seen\nto  complement  ongoing  development  efforts  in  the  project  area.  Other  aid  agency  programs\nincluding microfinance, agricultural extension services, tourism development, and NGO support are\nactive in the area and will benefit from the improved roads.\n                                                \n1  TA 3335\u2013KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "57\nAppendix 12, page 4\n14. Other Development Benefits. Project stakeholders anticipate that improving the Bishkek\u2013\nOsh road will result in increased household income, family budget savings from lower transport\ncosts, enhanced labor mobility, improved access to services, increased practice of family planning,\nand a wider range and better quality of goods available at central markets. Road improvements are\nalso expected to facilitate civil activity and the dissemination of information. Some stakeholders\nemphasized  the  need  to  complement  road  improvements  with  other  measures  such  as\nmicrofinance activities to support small and medium\u2013scale enterprise development and agriculture\nso as to realize full benefits from the Project and maximize its contribution to poverty reduction.\n2. Adverse Impacts\n15. Ethnic  Groups.  The  TA\u2019s  social  assessment  concluded  that  the  Project  would  not\nsignificantly  affect  ethnic  minorities.  Although  the  findings  identified  interethnic  relations  as  a\nsensitive  social  concern,  the  social  assessment  concluded  that  (i)  ethnic  groups  that  could\npotentially be adversely affected by the Project would not be affected on the basis of their ethnic\nidentity, and (ii) that access to project benefits would not be conditioned by ethnicity. The social\nassessment found no reason to conclude that ethnic minorities would be inherently more affected\nby the potentially adverse impacts of road rehabilitation than would other groups. The rehabilitated\nroads will be open to all groups, and not restricted or constrained on an ethnic basis.\n16. Resettlement. No resettlement, relocation activities, or land acquisition are anticipated. As\ncurrently proposed, the project activities will include no bypasses, significant realignments, or\ndevelopment of new alignments in previously undisturbed areas. However, in case the detailed\ndesign reveals that people need to be resettled or land has to be acquired, the Executing Agency\nwill comply with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines.\n17. Women. Through participatory rapid appraisal and other project\u2013design activities, it was\nconcluded that women do not face any special obstacle in accessing and benefiting from transport\nservices, nor are there apparent gender issues that might arise during implementation of the\nProject.  Consultations  also  indicate  that  women  are  likely  to  participate  in  the  employment\ngenerated by the proposed rehabilitation activities to some degree, although probably not to a\nlarge extent, especially for certain manual jobs.\n18. Other Vulnerable Groups. Vulnerable groups are perceived as the small\u2013scale farmers,\nthe unemployed and underemployed urban poor, pensioners, female heads of households, and\nothers who are vulnerable to changes in current economic conditions, including ethnic minorities.\nNone of these groups are perceived as vulnerable to adverse impacts resulting from the Project,\nhowever, and no adverse impacts to them are anticipated. The Project is not expected to entail\ninvoluntary resettlement, loss of livelihood, or price changes.\nD. Incorporation of Social Dimensions into the Project Design\n19. The social analysis indicates a need for activities to complement the road rehabilitation.\nAdditional components have been identified, and activities will be incorporated in the Project\nconsistent with ADB's guidelines.\n1. Rehabilitation of Roadside Social Infrastructure\n20. Pullover  areas  and  bus  shelters  exist  at  adequate  intervals  along  the  roadway,  but\ngenerally need repair. Sidewalks and pedestrian facilities in villages through which the road passes\nwill be restored and improved.", "58\nAppendix 12, page 5\n2.  Targeted Labor Recruitment\n21. Employment was widely identified as one of the major development benefits likely to be\ngained from the Project. Stakeholders argued that the most important way to maximize project\nbenefits was to give more attention to local employment. Recruitment should be targeted so that\nmaximum benefit goes to the most disadvantaged and impoverished members of the community.\nThe project design incorporates measures to improve local recruitment. Benefits resulting from this\ncomponent will be evaluated through the project performance management system (PPMS) by the\nproject implementation unit. Several stakeholders also drew attention to salary issues, alleging that\nlocal employees of foreign contractors and subcontractors are underpaid and that salaries are not\ngiven on time. Late payments to subcontractors and employees reportedly cause hardships to local\ncommunities and affected households.\n3.  Participation of Local Contractors\n22. A number of complaints touch on the participation of local contractors in the project road\nconstruction and their ability to compete with foreign firms in contract awards; fairness of contracts\nand contracting procedures; delayed payments for works; and the need to give preference to local\ncompanies. Citing experience in the ongoing road rehabilitation projects, several stakeholders\nrecommended that steps be taken to consolidate experience gained by local subcontractors and to\nstrengthen and prepare them for participation in the proposed Project. This is being done by the\ninternational consultants for the Second Road Rehabilitation Project.\n4. Targeted Procurement of Goods and Services\n23. The Project will also generate a considerable demand for goods and services that can be\npurchased, as much as possible, within the project area. Benefits resulting from this component\nwill also be evaluated as a part of the PPMS.\n5. Socially Transmitted Diseases\n24. The contractors will be required to distribute to all employees and casual laborers, and\ndisplay in prominent places, advice concerning the nature, dangers, and transmission of socially\ntransmitted  diseases  and  information  concerning  precautionary  measures.  Similar  material\nconcerning the dangers of drug use and the penalties associated with possession of and trafficking\nin drugs should also be distributed.", "59\nAppendix 13, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\n INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR\nA.  Objectives\n1. The technical assistance (TA) has two objectives. First, the consultants will help\nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) strengthen the management of\nthe secondary road network and give training to the maintenance organizations and the\nlocal communities. In performing their task, the consultants will work in cooperation with\ncommunity-based  organizations  or  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the\nsupervision consultants of the Project, who will supervise the implementation of the\nmaintenance operations after completion of the TA. Second, the consultants will study\nthe markets for transport services in the Kyrgyz Republic and recommend regulatory and\nother changes to increase their competitiveness. The cost estimates and financing plan\nare in Table A13.\nB.  Scope of Consulting Services\n2. It is estimated that about 17 person\u2013months of international and 40 person\u2013\nmonths of domestic consulting services will be required to implement the TA.\n1. Manual for Maintenance of Secondary Roads\n3. Using a participatory approach the consultants will\n(i)  discuss the methodologies of community\u2013based maintenance techniques\nwith local communities along the secondary roads included in the Project;\nand\n(ii)  prepare a manual for maintenance of the secondary roads, taking into\naccount the results of the discussions with the relevant local communities.\nThe manual will cover management of the roads, participation of the local\nroad  maintenance  units,  community\u2013based  maintenance,  maintenance\ntechniques, maintenance schedules, and financing of the maintenance\noperations.\n2. Training of Road Maintenance Personnel\n4. The consultants will\n(i)  give  the  personnel  of  MOTC  training  in  managing  and  financing\nconstruction,  rehabilitation,  and  maintenance  of  secondary  roads  by\norganizing seminars and workshops in the Kyrgyz Republic and designing\nspecialized  training  for  key  personnel  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nMOTC;\n(ii)  train the chief engineers of the road maintenance units to train the road\nmaintenance organizations of the local residents to undertake routine\nmaintenance of secondary roads supported by the maintenance units,\nwhich will assist the maintenance organizations with equipment; and", "60\nAppendix 13, page 2\n(iii)  develop, in cooperation with MOTC, a financing mechanism to enable the\nmaintenance organizations to finance the equipment, materials, and work\nneeded beyond their local resources.\n3.  Competitiveness of the Markets for Transport Services\n5. The consultants will\n(i)  survey passenger and freight vehicle drivers, owners, and users, and\nconduct interviews with Government officials and transport agencies and\ncompanies  to  confirm  the  findings  of  TA  3335-KGZ:  Third  Road\nRehabilitation Project and TA 3065-KGZ: Policy Support for the Transport\nSector  regarding  the  competitiveness  of  the  markets  for  transport\nservices;\n(ii)  based  on  the  surveys  and  previous  TAs,  prepare  an  analysis  of  the\nstructure  of  the  markets  for  passenger  and  freight  transport  services\n(excluding  urban  transport),  including  (a)  ownership  of  services,  (b)\ndegree of competition in the markets, (c) role played by and influence of\nthe Government in the markets, and (d) regulatory and other practices\nthat restrict competition and lead to higher fares for transport services;\n(iii)  determine the impact of the structure of the transport services markets on\nthe poor and very poor segments of the population, including the degree\nto which reductions in transport costs due to rehabilitation of the project\nroads are likely to be passed on to transport users and the extent to\nwhich  the  frequency  and  quality  of  transport  services  are  likely  to\nimprove; and\n(iv)  make  specific  recommendations  for  regulatory  changes  or  other\nmeasures  that  will  result  in  greater  competitiveness  in  the  transport\nservices markets; reduce Government influence in these markets; ensure\nthat reductions in transport costs are passed on to transport users; and\nstimulate  increased  frequency  of  transport  services  to  poor  areas,\nespecially those along the secondary roads; recommendations should\nalso consider the impact on the poorest part of the population and include\nmeasures to address any negative impact on that group.\nC.  Required Expertise\n6. Maintenance for secondary roads will require expertise in road maintenance\nengineering, financing, and training. Competitiveness of markets for transport services\nwill require expertise in economics of transport markets and transport sector policy\nreform.\nD.  Schedule and Reporting\n7. The consulting assignment is expected to start in July 2002 and be completed by\nMarch 2003.", "61\nAppendix 13, page 3\n8. The Government will provide office space for the consultants. The consultants\nwill hire the local administrative staff, equip their office, and provide local transportation.\n9. The consultants will provide the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with all papers\nand reports prepared under the TA, particularly policy recommendations and guidelines\nprepared for the studies and training programs. The consultants will submit brief monthly\nreports to ADB. Upon completion of their services, the consultants will prepare a draft\nfinal report covering all subjects and requirements under the TA. A final report will be\nprepared four weeks after the tripartite review meeting with the Government, ADB, and\nthe  consultants  and  the  receipt  of  comments  from  ADB  and  the  Government.

General\n1. The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  by  comparing  with\u2013  and  without\u2013project\nscenarios.  Economic  prices  are  expressed  using  the  world  price  numeraire.  The  Project\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  approximately  120  kilometers  (km)  of  the  Bishkek-Osh  road  and\nimprovement of approximately 125 km of secondary roads. In the without\u2013project scenario, the\nroad would receive only minimal maintenance and continue to deteriorate. The with-project\nscenario includes routine and periodic maintenance according to international standards. The\neconomic analysis covers a period of 23 years (2002-2024), including about 3 years for project\nimplementation. All benefits and costs are in constant 2001 prices.\nB. Costs\n2. Project  economic  costs  include  the  cost  of  resources  for  road  improvement  and\nmaintenance, as well as rural road improvement, equipment, and consulting services. Costs\nwere divided into tradable and nontradable. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was then\napplied to the nontradable portion.\nC. Benefits\n3. The principal sources of economic benefits from the Project are savings in vehicle\noperating costs (VOCs), passenger and  freight time savings, benefits arising from generated\ntraffic, and economic value added. Economic benefits were calculated with the same method\nused for costs. Improving the secondary roads will improve the access of the rural poor to\nmarkets  and  health  services.  Under  present  conditions,  transport  services  are  somewhat\nlimited, relative to potential demand, as vehicle owners and drivers are reluctant to drive on the\nmost deteriorated sections of the secondary roads. With improved conditions on these roads, it\nis expected that the frequency of service will increase, and fares and freight rates will decrease.\nThis will facilitate greater use of transport by local residents to markets, for example. Economic\nvalue added arises from the improved market access with improvement of secondary roads.\nThe benefits of improved access to health services or of improved safety conditions on the\nBishkek-Osh road were not included in the analysis as data to quantify them was insufficient.\n4. Savings in VOCs (Table A14.1) comprise the largest category of benefits, accounting for\nabout 76 percent of total benefits, and arise from the improved road conditions resulting from\nthe civil works carried out under the Project. The VOCs are calculated for each vehicle type.\nUnit economic VOCs for passenger and freight vehicles were estimated using the highway\ndesign  and  maintenance  model  (HDM-IV).  VOC  savings  will  accrue  primarily  from\nimprovements on the road surface, horizontal and vertical alignment, and increased average\nspeed on some sections. Generated traffic is expected to arise from the reduced VOCs. With a\n20 percent reduction in VOCs and a price elasticity of transport demand of 0.5, generated traffic\nis estimated at 10 percent of total traffic. Benefits from VOC savings for generated traffic are\nestimated at half the value for normal traffic. Benefits from international transit traffic, which\ncomprises about 5 percent of total traffic, are not included in the economic analysis as they do\nnot accrue to the Kyrgyz Republic.\n5. Rehabilitating the Bishkek-Osh road will result in time savings due to the improved road\nconditions. The value of time for passengers is calculated at $0.28 per working hour and $0.08\nper  nonworking  hour.  The  value  of  time  for  freight  traffic  was  estimated  based  on  the", "64\nAppendix 14, page 2\ncomposition of commodities transported by vehicle type and the value of the commodities. The\nvalues range from $0.05 per hour for light trucks to $0.22 per hour for articulated trucks.\nTable A14.1: Representative Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n($ per \u2018000 vehicle-km)\nLight Medium- Heavy Articulated\nScenario a Cars Pickups Buses Trucks size Trucks Trucks\nTrucks\nWithout Project 80 70 215 140 170 400 475\nWith Project 60 50 150 100 130 290 375\nVOC Savings 20 20 65 40 40 110 100\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\na  For Uzgen-Osh road section in 2005.\n6. Economic value added comprises the generated agricultural production resulting from\nimproved access to markets provided by the improved secondary roads. Surveys of residents in\nthe areas of the secondary roads indicate that a large proportion of residents will increase\nagricultural production to sell in markets along the secondary roads and the Bishkek-Osh road.\nThe  surveys  also  indicate  that  significant  numbers  of  residents  will  shift  to  higher  value\nagricultural crops to take advantage of the improved access to markets. The economic value\nadded is calculated at 60 percent of the value of agricultural production.\nD. Results of Economic Analysis\n7. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 19.3 percent (Table A14.2),\nand the net present value is $28.2 million. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects\nof negative changes in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project.\nThe sensitivity analysis (Table A14.3) indicates that costs would have to increase by 77 percent\nor benefits decrease by 43.5 percent for the EIRR to reach the cutoff level of 12 percent. Given\nthe straightforward nature of the rehabilitation works and the executing agency\u2019s experience\nwith similar projects, such changes are unlikely to occur.\n8. Distribution analysis was carried out for the net economic benefits arising from the\nProject.  The  benefits  were  distributed  among  (i)  passengers,  (ii)  freight  users,  (iii)  vehicle\nowners, (iv) direct labor, and (v) the Government/economy (Table A14.4). The distribution is\nbased on the development of increased competitiveness of transport services in the project\narea, as a result of the policy reforms to be implemented as part of the Project. The increased\ncompetitiveness will result in a higher proportion of  VOC savings being passed on to passenger\nand freight transport users than would be the case without the Project. It is assumed that vehicle\nowners will pass on 50 percent of VOC savings to users in the form of lower fares and freight\nrates. The benefits from the economic value added from generated agricultural production\naccrue  to  direct  labor,  based  on  poverty  incidence  in  the  areas  of  the  secondary  roads.\nPassenger users receive the largest proportion of benefits at 46 percent, followed by labor at 33\npercent.", " 65 Appendix 14, page 3\nTable A14.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n($ million)\nCosts Benefits\nVOC  Time  Generated  Economic  Total  Net \nYear Capital Maintenance Total \nSavings Savings Traffic Value  Benefits\n2002 13.475 13.475 (13.475)\n2003 17.966 17.966 0.550 0.056 0.039 0.644 (17.322)\n2004 13.475 13.475 1.576 0.178 0.113 1.866 (11.609)\n2005 0.000 0.014 0.014 3.021 0.418 0.216 0.410 4.065 4.051\n2006 0.000 0.014 0.014 4.670 0.808 0.334 0.820 6.632 6.618\n2007 0.000 0.014 0.014 5.888 1.114 0.421 1.230 8.652 8.638\n2008 0.000 0.014 0.014 6.324 1.211 0.452 1.640 9.627 9.613\n2009 0.000 0.014 0.014 6.815 1.327 0.487 2.050 10.679 10.665\n2010 0.000 0.014 0.014 7.380 1.461 0.527 2.050 11.418 11.404\n2011 0.345 0.014 0.359 7.923 1.597 0.566 2.050 12.136 11.777\n2012 0.419 0.014 0.433 8.458 1.737 0.604 2.050 12.848 12.415\n2013 0.000 0.014 0.014 8.803 1.863 0.629 2.050 13.345 13.331\n2014 0.000 0.014 0.014 9.506 2.047 0.679 2.050 14.283 14.269\n2015 0.000 0.014 0.014 10.267 2.239 0.733 2.050 15.289 15.275\n2016 0.070 0.014 0.084 11.001 2.416 0.786 2.050 16.253 16.169\n2017 1.110 0.014 1.124 11.745 2.597 0.839 2.050 17.231 16.107\n2018 0.000 0.014 0.014 12.917 2.844 0.923 2.050 18.733 18.719\n2019 0.983 0.014 0.997 13.765 3.053 0.983 2.050 19.851 18.854\n2020 0.000 0.014 0.014 14.894 3.286 1.064 2.050 21.294 21.280\n2021 0.000 0.014 0.014 15.894 3.519 1.135 2.050 22.599 22.584\n2022 0.345 0.014 0.359 16.826 3.740 1.202 2.050 23.818 23.459\n2023 0.419 0.014 0.433 17.666 3.934 1.262 2.050 24.912 24.479\n2024 0.000 0.014 0.014 18.368 4.093 1.312 2.050 25.822 25.808\nVOC = vehicle operating costs.\nSource: ADB estimates.

Introduction\n1. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 consultants prepared a poverty impact\nanalysis (PIA) of the proposed Third Road Rehabilitation Project. The PIA\n(i)  assessed the extent to which transport cost reductions will be passed on to users of\npassenger and freight transport services;\n(ii)  assessed the distribution of the net benefits between users of transport services and\nother groups;\n(iii)  identified the proportion of poor and very poor beneficiaries and the net benefits\nthey will receive;\n(iv)  clarified the assumptions and analysis behind the distribution analysis and poverty\nimpact assessment; and\n(v)  identified complementary activities to help reduce poverty in the project area.\n2. The main finding is that the Project will directly benefit the poor and very poor people in the\nproject area. It will give them a substantial share of the net benefits from the Bishkek\u2013Osh road\nand secondary roads by decreasing vehicle operating costs and improving access to markets,\nemployment opportunities, and health facilities.\nB. Poverty\n1.  Definition of Poverty\n3. The Kyrgyz National Statistics Committee in conjunction with the World Bank set two\npoverty lines for the Kyrgyz Republic: the first or the \"food\" poverty line measures \u201cextreme\npoverty\u201d and is set at the level of consumption below which, even if all resources were devoted to\nfood, the minimum caloric requirement would not be met. The other, or the \u201cgeneral\u201d poverty line,\nrepresents a minimum per capita consumption basket that includes food and nonfood items. The\nvalue of the general poverty line for the year 2000 is Som7,580 (equivalent to approximately $158)\nand that of the extreme poverty line is Som4,563 (equivalent to approximately $95). These have\nbeen adopted by all international agencies and Government offices to define poverty in the Kyrgyz\nRepublic.\n2.  The Policy Environment\n4. The comprehensive development framework (CDF) is the Government\u2019s framework for the\ncountry\u2019s development over the period 2000\u20132010. A key element of the CDF is the national\nstrategy for poverty reduction (NSPR). The premises and key features of the CDF are\n(i)  growth and development of the private sector,\n(ii)  growth of employment and reduction of unemployment,\n(iii)  growth of Government revenues,\n(iv)  improving the tax system, and\n(v)  providing targeted assistance to vulnerable groups.\n                                                \n1 TA  3335-KGZ: Third Road Rehabilitation Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 December 1999.", "68\nAppendix 15, page 2\n5. The Government, with the support of the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and\nthe United Nations Development Programme, is currently drafting the NSPR. The strategy will\ndefine the priority areas of intervention for each sector and also geographically so as to maximize\nthe poverty reduction impact of foreign and domestic investments. The NSPR has highlighted the\nimportance of the transport sector principally for promoting political stability, economic growth, and\ntrade as a necessary step in reaching the country's development and poverty\u2013reduction goals.\n3.  Poverty Profile\n6. At the national level, the proportion of households living in poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic\nincreased from 43.5 percent in 1996 to 54.9 percent in 1998. Similarly, the incidence of extreme\npoverty increased from 19.1 percent in 1996 to 23.0 percent in 1998. With the increased economic\ngrowth since 1998, the overall poverty incidence dropped to 52.0 percent in 2000 (Table A15.1),\nwhile the percentage of the extremely poor decreased to 17.8 percent.\nTable A15.1:  Kyrgyz Republic Poverty Incidence and Per Capita Income, by Province \u2013 2000\nPer Capita Total\nPoor Extremely Non\u2013Poor\nLocation Income Population\n% Poor % %\n(Som) (thousands)\nChuy 8,056 28.1 4.5 71.9 767.1\nJalal\u2013Abada 4,179 67.9 15.1 32.1 893.9\nOsha 5,457 51.6 19.8 48.4 1,211.7\nTalas 4,041 72.7 36.6 27.3 204.1\nNaryn 3,155 81.4 37.6 18.6 254.2\nIssyk\u2013Kul 4,631 60.9 27.6 39.1 420.2\nBatken 4,125 69.0 34.3 31.0 390.8\nBishkek 9,644 29.9 5.8 70.1 793.4\nNational Average 5,945 52.0 17.8 48.0 4,935.4\naProvinces traversed by the project roads.\nSource: 1996\u20131998 Kyrgyz Poverty Monitoring Surveys, World Bank, and National Statistics Committee, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, 2000.\n7. Within a country in which more than half of the population is classified as poor, the data\nindicate that in the project area2 there are extremely high poverty rates (ranging roughly from 46 to\n95 percent) and that five of the six districts (Table A15.2) directly affected by the proposed Project\nhave a poverty incidence above the national average. The Project will directly affect 1.3 million\npeople (27 percent of the total population) of which 963,000 are poor, resulting in a poverty\nincidence of 73 percent.\n                                                \n2  The Project area is four districts and three cities in Jalal-Abad Province (Bazar Korgon, Ak-Syi, Nooken, Suzak, Jalal-\nAbad City, Tash Kumyr City, and Mayluu-Suu City), and two districts and one city in Osh Province (Kara Suu, Uzgen,\nand Osh City). The populations of these districts will be directly affected by the project roads.", "69\nAppendix 15, page 3\nTable A15.2: Poverty Incidence Percentages and Absolute Numbers for\nProject Area Districts \u2013 1998a\nPercentage Absolute Numbers\nOf which, Of which,\nAffected District/City Non\u2013\nPoor extremely Poor extremely Non\u2013 Total\nPoor\npoor poor poor\nJalal\u2013Abad Province\nBazar Korgon District 95 70 5 112,669 83,727 6,431 119,100\nAk\u2013Syi District 57 13 43 54,130 12,484 41,170 95,300\nNooken District 86 30 14 22,994 7,933 3,806 26,800\nSuzak District 46 8 54 87,406 15,560 104,695 192,100\nJalal\u2013Abad City 41 12 59 33,128 9,696 47,672 80,800\nTash Kumyr City 61 \u2014 39 24,583 \u2014 15,717 40,300\nMayluu\u2013Suu City 38 \u2014 62 8,816 \u2014 14,384 23,200\nOsh Province\nKara Suu District 84 23 16 249,816 68,402 47,584 297,400\nUzgen District 84 20 16 164,640 39,200 31,360 196,000\nOsh City 85 56 15 204,875 134,584 35,025 239,900\nTotal Project Area 73 28 27 963,057 371,586 347,844 1,310,900\nNational Averageb 52 18 48\n\u2014  = no available data.\naData on poverty incidence by district and city are only available through 1998.\nbData for 2000.\nSource:  1998 Poverty Monitoring Survey by the World Bank and National Statistics Committee.\nB.  The Poor and the Transport Sector\n8. Through household surveys and focus groups, the TA gathered information on various\nissues regarding the poor and the transport sector.\n1.  The Passenger Transportation Market\n9. Vehicle Ownership. The results for the provinces in the project area are very similar to the\naggregate for the country. The poor and very poor do not own motor vehicles. Given the breadth of\npoverty, the ownership rates are somewhat higher than expected for the middle\u2013income quintiles\n(Table A15.3).\nTable A15.3: Percent of Households Reporting Ownership of a Motor Vehicle, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, by Total Per Capita Household Expenditure Quintile\nTotal Per Capita\nYes No\nExpenditure Quintile\n81\u2013100% 9 91\n61\u201380% 5 95\n41\u201360% 4 96\n21\u201340 % 3 97\n0\u201320% 2 98\nSource: Poverty Monitoring Survey.\n10. Income Levels and Transport Expenses. The Project\u2019s household survey results show\nhow expenditures for transport and gasoline vary by per capita income levels  (Table A.15.4). The\ndisparity between expenditures for transporting farm produce to market suggests that only the\nbetter\u2013off farmers travel to more distant markets.", "70\nAppendix 15, page 4\nTable A15.4: Households in the Project Area and Transportation Expenditure (Som), 2000\nAverage Total Average Per Capita Average Per Capita\nTotal Per Capita Monthly Per Monthly Monthly Expenditure\nExpenditure Quintile Capita  Income Expenditure on all to Transport  Farm\nTransportation Producea\n81 \u2013 100% 1,508 169 36\n61 \u2013 80% 763 77 4\n41 \u2013 60% 611 51 3\n21 \u2013 40 % 443 36 3\n0 \u2013 20% 391 25 2\naFor those engaged in farming or marketing farm produce.\nSource: Consultant Household Survey, The Kyrgyz Republic, 2000.\n11. Competitiveness of Transport Services. Results of the surveys suggest that the market\nfor passenger transport on the Bishkek\u2013Osh road is somewhat competitive, but the public sector\nstill  has  a  large  influence.  While  the  Government  has  privatized  the  majority  of  transport\nenterprises, it still maintains large holdings in the joint\u2013stock companies, which comprise the\nlargest share of privatized enterprises. The surveys confirmed the Government\u2019s presence in the\ntransport market. Of the drivers of passenger vehicles surveyed, a third are employed by the\nGovernment or lease their vehicles from the Government. The remainder of the passenger vehicles\nare driven by owner/operators, almost all of whom own only one vehicle. Fares vary by vehicle type\nand distance, as is to be expected in a competitive market. About 15 percent of passenger drivers\nsaid they would reduce the fares they charged based on the vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings\nthey would realize from the rehabilitated project roads.\n12. The Government owns the bus stations along the Bishkek\u2013Osh road. The bus terminal\noperators require large bus operators to travel previously approved routes. The bus terminals also\nset the fares that the drivers can charge. Each driver is issued a document approving each trip\nfrom  origin  to  final  destination.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs,  through  its  own  checkpoints,\nroutinely  stops  large  bus  drivers  to  check  their  papers.  Large  bus  drivers  without  the\ndocumentation issued by the bus terminal must make frequent unofficial payments to proceed to\ntheir destinations. Moreover, these unofficial payments are large so that such trips are not very\nprofitable and are thus a relatively rare event. The survey indicates that unofficial payments are\nmade at various checkpoints set up by Government agencies. These informal tolls run as high as\nSom1,500 per vehicle per checkpoint for drivers of freight vehicles and Som200 per vehicle per\ncheckpoint for drivers of passenger vehicles.\n2.  Poor People\u2019s Use of the Project Roads\n13. The surveys show that the users of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are predominantly poor. Of the\n113 passengers surveyed, 73 percent were below the poverty line, and 52 percent were below the\nextreme poverty line.3 People engaged in nonfarm commerce make up about a third of the road\nusers surveyed. The other large group of users (35 percent) comprises professionals who are\nprimarily in the public sector. Of the passengers using the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, 70 percent live in\nrural areas. They tend to use the road for local as opposed to long\u2013distance trips.\n                                                \n3  As was done for the Poverty Monitoring Survey (PMS) and all of the consultant\u2019s surveys, reported expenditures were\nadjusted upward to take into account people's noncash incomes. Using the PMS method, an estimated 26 percent of\nrural household income is produced on land near the home. For urban households, the PMS estimated that 5 percent\nof household income was produced via noncash means. Even with these upward adjustments, the results show that\nthe poor and extremely poor comprise very large proportions of the project road users.", "71\nAppendix 15, page 5\n3. Access to Social Services\n14. As with most countries of the former Soviet Union, access to lower\u2013level schools and\nhospitals/health facilities generally is not a major issue. The vast majority of passengers with\nschool\u2013age children reported that the school is less than a kilometer from their residence and that\nall the children walk to school. Over three quarters of them said that it takes their children less than\n30 minutes to reach school. The results are nearly the same for hospitals/clinics. About two thirds\nsay they walk to the nearest hospital or clinic, and about 80 percent say that the trip takes less\nthan 30 minutes. The only access problem occurs when there is a health emergency situation, a\nneed for more comprehensive health facilities, or when one wants to reach higher education\nfacilities that are found in the district center. Men and women use the road with equal frequency.\nThe average age of the passengers on the road is 38. The profile of household size fits the\nnational  pattern,  with  rural  households  approaching  six  persons  and  urban  households\napproaching three persons.\nC.  The Secondary Road Network\n15. Evaluation criteria and an evaluation system were developed to identify secondary roads to be\nimproved by the Project. The system incorporated inputs from MOTC, as well as from MOTC provincial\noffices and local maintenance units in the project area. Inputs from other local government units at the\nprovincial and district levels, and other stakeholders, including prospective beneficiaries, were also\nsolicited and their road nominations considered.\n16. The following criteria were used to form the shortlist:\n(i)  population and population density within the road area of influence;\n(ii)  extent and degree of poverty within the beneficiary population;\n(iii)  cash crop production and potential of the agricultural areas to be served by the\nsecondary roads;\n(iv)  extent to which the roads would improve access to employment, health, education,\nand other services (i.e., number of schools and clinics served);\n(v)  existing and potential traffic volumes on the roads; and\n(vi)  environmental assessment.\n17. The selected secondary roads are listed in Table A15.5.\nTable A15.5: Selected Secondary Roads\nRoad Length To Be Population Served\nRehabilitated (km)\nBazar Korgon\u2013Arslanbob 72 37,400\n(including Kyzyl Ungkur\nbranch)\nTash  Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz 53 102,000\n(i)  The  Bazar  Korgon\u2013Arslanbob  road  connects  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road  to  the  Kyzyl\nUngkur road segment. The valley\u2019s economic potential lies in its rich agricultural\nresource base\u2013cotton, tobacco, and rice, as well as orchards and livestock. Farmers\nalso tend walnut trees along the productive segments of this road. The Government\npermits, but regulates, selective harvesting of wood. Walnut wood is a high\u2013value\ncommodity  and  an  appropriate  extension  program  could  help  farmers  expand", "72\nAppendix 15, page 6\nproduction of the nuts and the wood. The Kyzyl Ungkur branch is 35 km from the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road. According to the social, economic, and environmental criteria, this\nroad segment is the top priority road requiring improvement. The population of the valley\nis served by a hospital that has 6 doctors and 42 nurses. The hospital seems in good\ncondition although patients have to buy their own medicine in order to be treated and\npurchase fuel if they need to be transported to the main hospital in Jalal\u2013Abad.\n(ii)  The Tash Kumyr\u2013Kara Djigadz road has become, due to the border controls imposed\nby Uzbekistan, the only outlet to markets for people living along the road. At the\nbeginning  of  the  road,  just  off  the  Bishkek\u2013Osh  road,  coal  mining  still  provides\nminimal economic activity. In the relatively poorer areas of the district, economic\npotential is limited to sheep and goat husbandry. However, for the town and the\nsurrounding valley the outlook will be much better with improved access. This area is\nbetter endowed with agricultural potential, with cotton and tobacco being prominent\ncrops. Improving the road will help facilitate economic growth and reduce poverty\ncaused by the cessation of access to markets in Uzbekistan.\nD.  Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio\n18. The estimated direct benefits to the economy as a whole of rehabilitating the Bishkek\u2013Osh\nroad and the secondary roads are $28.2 million in present value (PV). This is a conservative\nestimate, because only direct benefits are considered, and represents the sum of the PV of\nbenefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, labor, and the Government or the economy.\nThe distribution of net benefits (Table A15.6) is based on increased competitiveness of markets for\ntransport services in the project area, which will result from the policy reforms to be implemented\nas part of the Project. As a result of increased competitiveness, a higher proportion of VOC\nsavings will be passed on to the poor than would be the case without the Project. It is assumed\nthat vehicle owners will pass on 50 percent of VOC savings to users in the form of lower fares and\nfreight rates.\nTable A15.6: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio\n($ million)\nFinancial Economic Economic \u2013 Passengers Freight Vehicle Labor Govt/ Net Lender\nItem Present Present Financial Users Owners Economy National Foreign\nValue Value Benefits\nNet Project Benefits 28.220 28.220 12.933 5.493 0.736 9.207 -0.150\nNet Loan Flows -21.980 21.980 21.980 -21.980\nGovernment's\nFinancial Revenues -4.132 4.132 4.132\nNet Present Value 28.220 54.332 12.933 5.493 0.736 9.207 25.962 -21.980\nGains and Losses 12.933 5.493 0.736 9.207 25.962 54.332\nProportion of the\nPoor (%) 73 60 5 80 33\nNet Benefits for the\nPoor 9.441 3.296 0.037 7.365 8.568 28.707\nPoverty Impact Ratio 53%\n19. The Project will also provide indirect benefits, such as the increased trade and economic\nactivity induced by the improved road, in addition to the generated agricultural production included\nin the economic analysis. The size of the indirect benefits will depend on how the regional and\nnational economies grow over the Project's time horizon. The indirect benefits will affect the poor in", "73\nAppendix 15, page 7\ntwo ways: first, jobs and other economic opportunities will be created; and second, the tax revenue\narising from the generated economic activity will provide more funding for social services.\n20. To assess the poverty impact of the Project, the proportion of the poor in each category of\nbeneficiary was determined, based on extensive surveys in the project area carried out by the TA\nconsultants and by analysis of Government expenditures. The surveys indicated that 73 percent of\npassengers using the Bishkek\u2013Osh road are poor (which corresponds to poverty incidence in the\nproject area), while 60 percent of freight users are poor. Among the users of freight services are\nsmall farmers sending their goods to market as well as individuals engaged in small\u2013scale trading\nactivities. The Project will use a high level of unskilled labor, and the proportion of the poor for\nlabor is estimated at 80 percent. Benefits from the economic value added from the generated\nagricultural production have been distributed to labor, in accordance with poverty incidence in the\nareas along the secondary roads. For benefits accruing to the Government or the economy, it was\ncalculated that 33 percent will go to the poor, based on the proportion of Government spending\ndirected to the poor, and determined through analysis of Government expenditure data.\n21. As part of the benefits analysis, the poverty impact ratio (PIR) was computed for the\nBishkek\u2013Osh road and the secondary roads, based on the present value of the benefits. The PIR\nrepresents the proportion of project benefits that accrue to the poor. The PIR is 0.53, indicating that\n53 percent of the net project benefits reach poor users. With the 73 percent proportion of the poor\namong project beneficiaries and the PIR of 53 percent, the Project is expected to have a significant\npoverty\u2013reduction impact. However, since the Project is beneficiary non\u2013specific and it cannot be\nguaranteed that the Projects benefits will be passed on to the poor, by ADB's poverty classification\ncriteria the Project is classified as other, with a thematic priority of economic growth.\n22. Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  the  effect  of  reduced  competition  for\ntransport services on the poverty reduction impact of the Project. The analysis was conducted for a\nscenario of reduced competition in which it is assumed that vehicle owners pass on only 5 percent\nof reductions in VOCs to road users, compared with 50 percent in the base case. In the reduced\ncompetition scenario, the PIR is estimated to be 44 percent (Table A15.7), versus 53 percent in the\nbase case. This demonstrates that increased competition in the transport market is an important\nfactor in ensuring that benefits are passed on to the poor, and reinforces the importance of the\nProject\u2019s policy dialogue on this issue.\nTable A15.7: Sensitivity Analysis: Distribution of Net Benefits and Poverty Impact Ratio with\nLess Competitive Transport Markets\n($ million)\nFinancial Economic Economic Passengers Freight Vehicle Labor Govt/ Net Lender\nPresent Present \u2013Financial Users Owners Economy National Foreign\nItem Value Value Benefits\nNet Project Benefits 28.220 28.220 4.963 2.107 6.995 11.047 3.108\nNet Financial Flows -21.980 0.000 21.980 21.980 -21.980\nGovernment's\nFinancial Revenues -4.132 0.000 4.132 4.132\nNet Present Value 28.220 54.332 4.963 2.107 6.995 11.047 29.220 0.000 -21.980\nGains and Losses 4.963 2.107 6.995 11.047 29.220 54.332\nProportion of the\nPoor (%) 73 60 5 80 33\nNet Benefits for the\nPoor 3.623 1.264 0.350 8.837 9.643 23.717\nPoverty Impact Ratio 44%"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011012145929", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R175-01.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011114171550+08'00'"}}
