The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will help  align  Government  of\nIndonesia and Asian Development Bank (ADB) systems\u2014social and environmental safeguards,\nprocurement,  and  project  preparation  and  start-up\u2014to  improve project  performance.1 The\ngovernment requested the TA through dialogue between the National Development Planning\nAgency (BAPPENAS) and ADB. The concept paper for the TA was approved on 6 November\n2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.\nII. ISSUES\n2. ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  portfolio  in  Indonesia  is  growing, and its  performance  can  be\nenhanced if project preparation  and  implementation challenges  can  be  overcome. Better\nalignment of ADB and government systems and procedures will expedite and improve project\nreadiness and quality at entry, strengthen performance during administration, and increase\ndevelopment effectiveness. Safeguards and procurement activities are the two largest project\npreparation and implementation concerns, and they would benefit from greater harmonization.\nThe government has its ownlaws, regulations,andinstitutional arrangements for safeguardsand\nprocurement. ADB also has its own policies and procedures. The dissonance between ADB and\ngovernment systems and the resulting complications lead to  project  preparation  and\nimplementation delays,  which reduce development effectiveness. Indonesia\u2019s recent\nachievements in strengthening its own safeguard and procurement frameworks also provide a\ncompelling rationalefor greater alignment of ADB and government systems.\n3. A high level of project readiness not only for safeguards and procurement, but also\nimplementation arrangements, financing, budgeting, and many other activities is essential to\ncreate a seamless flow between project preparation, approval, start-up, and implementation.\nGreater alignment of ADB and government project cycles and business processes will boost\npreparation efficiency and the ability to meet project readiness criteria, and accelerate project\napprovals, start-up, and implementation, which will all result in stronger development impact.\n4. Country safeguard systems. To support its infrastructure development, Indonesia has\nits own country safeguard systems (CSS) for involuntary resettlement and the environment.\nNotably in January 2012, the government promulgated Law No. 2/2012 on Land Acquisition for\nDevelopment  in  the  Public  Interest (Land  Acquisition  Law) and  subsequently  prepared  its\nimplementing regulations.2 TheLand Acquisition Lawprovides clear, time-bound procedureswith\nthe objective to accelerate land acquisition through eminent domain. The law has significantly\nimprovedtheCSS forresettlement with greater protectionofthe rights of property ownersthrough\nconsultation and fair compensation, and it also deals with compensation for non-titled property\nholders. The provisions under the Land Acquisition Law are substantiallymore aligned withADB\u2019s\nSafeguard Policy Statement (SPS, 2009) than the previous government resettlement policy\nframework. Yet several gaps between the Land Acquisition Law and the SPS remain with regard\nto the law\u2019s application to ADB-financed projects.\n5. The CSS for a project-specific environmental impact assessment (AMDAL) and related\nactivitiesin Indonesia are more developed thanforresettlement and are aligned to a large degree\n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 November 2013. A fact-finding\nmissionwas conductedfrom7 October to 5 November 2013(intermittent).\n2 CSS  means  a  country\u2019s  legal  and  institutional  framework,  consisting  of  its national,  subnational,  or sector\nimplementing institutions and relevant laws, regulations, rules, and procedures that pertain to the policy areas of\nenvironmental and social safeguards.ADB. 2009.Safeguard Policy Statement.Manila.", "2\nwith  ADB  safeguards.  The  primary  policy  provision  for AMDAL  is Law  No.32/2009 on\nEnvironmental Protection and Management under the Ministry of Environment. A well-developed\nconsulting  practice  exists to  support  preparation  and  execution  of  required  environmental\nactivities, andgovernment capacity formanagement andregulationis improving. Scope exists to\nuse environmental CSS in ADB-financed projects.\n6. ADB has supported the government in strengthening safeguards through dedicated TA\nprojects and project-oriented capacity building during project preparation and implementation.\nTheseTAprojects include (i) EnhancingtheLegal and Administrative Frameworkfor Land,which\nsupported preparation of the Land Acquisition Law,3 and the ongoing (ii) Strengthening and Use\nof  Country  Safeguard  Systems with two  subprojects:  (a)  Strengthening the Capacity  of\nIndonesia\u2019sAMDALSystem; and (b) Capacity Development for Social Safeguard Preparation and\nImplementation  in  Water  Resources and  Energy  in  Indonesia. 4 This latter,  ongoing TA\nstrengthensthecapacityof Indonesian agenciesfor usingtheir existing CSS. Building onthisTA\nsupport and on improvements to Indonesia\u2019s own CSS, BAPPENAS requested the use of CSS\nfor ADB-financed projects.5 ADB\u2019s SPS endorses the use of CSS supported by a country\nsafeguard review (CSR) through equivalence (legal and policy) and acceptability (capacity)\nassessments todetectgaps and to prepare time-bound action plans with remedial measures and\ncapacity building to ensure compliance with the SPS.\n7. Country procurement systems. ADB requires that ADB-financed projects follow ADB\nprocurement procedures. Under national competitive bidding, ADB allows the use of national\nprocurement systems provided that the national procedures are consistent with ADB procurement\nguidelines. Both ADB and the government have well-developed procurement procedures that are\nstandardized  for  public  sector  agencies.  However, project-specific practice  often  indicates\ninadequate understanding of and ability to execute procurement activities. This is often due to\ndifferent procedures and practices applied between ADB and government procurementsystems.\nThese differences often delay project implementation and result in inefficient public expenditure\nand diminished development impact.\n8. ADB proposes to carry out a country and sector procurement risk assessment to identify\nprocurement processes (including e-procurement) that could undermine project implementation\nand/or achievement of project outcomes. This approach is designed to yield recommendations\nthat strengthen national procurement systems and improve the use of ADB resources. An\nimportant part of it is to assess government procurement regulations so as to improve alignment\nbetween ADB and government procurement procedures for better use of country procurement\nsystems. ADB has helped strengthen government procurement systems through earlier TA\nprojects, such as (i) Procurement Policies, Legal Framework, and Institutions, which assisted\nBAPPENAS in establishing the National Public Procurement Agency with capacity building,6 and\n(ii) Support for the State Audit Reform Sector Program, which helped the procurement agency\ndevelop the government\u2019s e-procurement system.7\n3 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Enhancing the Legal and Administrative\nFramework for Land.Manila (TA 7038-INO).\n4 ADB. 2011.Technical AssistanceforStrengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems.Manila (TA 7566-REG).\n5 BAPPENAS requested the use of CSS for ADB-financed projects in correspondence to ADB on 23 July 2013.\n6 ADB. 2001.Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia forStrengthening ProcurementPolicies, Framework,\nand Institutions.Manila (TA 3720-INO).\n7 ADB. 2004.Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for State Audit Reform Sector Program.\nManila (TA 4474-INO).", "3\n9. Project readiness and start-up. BAPPENAS plays a key role in the selection, approval,\nand implementation of projects financed by ADB and other development partners. Instrumental\nto BAPPENAS\u2019 programming are the Blue Book, which contains all the projects for foreign-\nassisted funding under the national government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN),\nand the Green Book, which confirms the readiness oftheprojects in a given year that can proceed\nto  loan  negotiations.8 To  help  screen  projects  for  the  Green  Book  and progress to loan\nnegotiations, BAPPENAS has a set of readiness criteria that includes preparation of AMDAL,\nresettlement plans, implementation plans, financing, and disbursement plans.9 Many of the\nreadiness criteria are consistent with ADB business processes, yetbetteralignment of scheduling,\nresources, and outputs for project preparation and start-up would bolster the ability to meet\nreadiness criteria and improve implementation.\n10. To meet BAPPENAS\u2019 readiness criteria and strengthen project preparation and start-up,\ngreater alignment is also needed between the ADB project cycle and business processes and\nother government procedures, including annual line agency planning, budgeting, counterpart\nstaffing, preparation of detailed engineering design, and recruitment of project management\nconsultants. In many cases, local government involvement also needs to be coordinated and\nintegrated with ADB  project  preparation  and  start-up  activities.  Improving  ADB\u2019s  and the\ngovernment\u2019s ability to work together effectively within existing cycles and processes, as well as\nexploring options to advance preparation and start-up activities (such as detailed engineering\ndesign), will  reduce project  delays,  accelerate  progress  and  disbursement,  and deepen\ndevelopment impact. A comprehensive assessment of theactivitiesandproceduresrelated to the\nBAPPENAS readiness criteriaandother government processesforproject preparation and start-\nup is neededto achieve all this.\n11. Capacity building. While analysis of how to align ADB and government procedures is\nrequired to improve project performance, capacity building for counterparts is also necessary.\nOften the capacity of the implementing agencies is still insufficient to effectively execute actions\nrelated  to  safeguards  and  procurement, and  project  preparation  and start-up  activities.  An\neffective approach to capacity development is to carry out capacity assessments, draft capacity\ndevelopment plans, and pilot activities that can be scaled up in a larger dedicated effort once\nlessons aregarnered and methods confirmed.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n12. The impact will be greater efficiency and effectiveness in preparing and implementing\nADB-financed infrastructure projects in Indonesia. The outcome will be increased alignment of\nADB and government systems and proceduresto prepare and implement projects.\nB. Methodology and Key Activities\n13. The proposed TA is innovative in its approach to improving project performance through\n(i) the use of CSS for the first time with an ADB developing member country, (ii) the use ofADB\u2019s\nrisk-based approach to adopting country procurement systems, and (iii) better alignment of ADB\nand government business systems for project preparation and start-up.\n8 The RPJMN and Blue Book will be updated in 2014 for2015\u20132019. ADB is providing assistance to the government\nfor infrastructure sector studies to support preparation of the RPJMN update.\n9 BAPPENASdefines its readiness criteria inRegulation 4 of 2011 on Procedures for Planning, Proposing, Assessing,\nandMonitoring and Evaluating Activities Financed by Foreign Loans and Grants.", "4\n14. Output 1: Countrysafeguard systems reviewed. Output 1 will support the CSR for the\nassessments and action plans to apply CSS for environment and resettlement in ADB-financed\nprojects in the energy, transport, water resources,and water supply and sanitation sectors. ADB\u2019s\nSPS provides guidance to assess and strengthen CSS for application to ADB-financed projects.\nFirst, output 1 will support an equivalence assessment that examines the national, sector, and\nselected  subnational  legal,  regulatory, and  administrative  frameworks  for  environment  and\nresettlement CSS. The equivalence assessment will provide the basis for remedial measures to\nensure compliance withthe SPS. The subprojects under theongoingTA (footnote 4) will support\nthe  equivalence  assessment  and  have already  sensitized the government  to  ADB\u2019s  CSS\napproach.\n15. Second, the TA will support the CSR in an acceptability assessment to review the\ngovernment\u2019s implementation practice, capacity, and track record in implementing existing CSS\nunder national, sector, and selected subnational agencies. The acceptability assessment will\nconfirm if implementation is consistent with CSS procedures for Indonesia and with those under\nADB\u2019s SPS. The CSR will provide remedial measures to strengthen the performance of CSS\nagencies to ensure compliance with the SPS. Based on the equivalence and acceptability\nassessments, the TA will prepare a time-bound action plan(s) to be agreed by ADB and the\ngovernmentthat will(i) defineremedial measures to ensure consistency between CSSandSPS,\nand (ii) specify  capacity  development  activities  to  ensure  acceptable  implementation.\nConsultations will be held with the government and other stakeholders (including civil society) to\nvalidate the equivalence and acceptability assessments andthesubsequent action plan(s).\n16. Output 2: Harmonized procurement. Output 2 from the TA will provide a gap analysis\nof government and ADB procurement guidelines to identify differences such as provisions in\nbidding documents for procurement of goods, works, and consultants. This analysis will review\nnational  competitive  bidding documents  and  their annexes  and  make  recommendations  to\nimprove current Indonesian national competitive bidding procedures and documents for more\ncompatible use with ADB-financed projects. The analysis will reviewthegovernment\u2019sguidelines\nfor international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures to assess their alignment with ADB\u2019s ICB\nprocedures,andprovide recommendations to harmonize government and ADB definitionsof ICB\nand develop mutually acceptable ICB documents. The analysis will include country and sector\nprocurement risk  assessments and generate  recommendations  to  improve  government\nprocurement systems with an emphasis on efficiency and transparency.10\n17. Output  3: Improved project  readiness  and  start-up. Output  3  will analyze the\nintersection ofBAPPENASprocedures andprojectreadiness criteriawithADB\u2019sproject cycle and\nbusiness processes. This analysis will evaluate the backward links to line agency activities\nrequired to prepare projects and meetthereadiness criteria. This would include reviewof budget\ncycles, line agency planning, counterpart staffing, involvement of local governments, and other\ngovernmentactionsaffecting project preparation. Output 3 will also analyze government and ADB\nprocedures related to project start-up to (i) optimize sequencing and (ii) develop options to\naccelerate project start-up for such things as feasibility studies, detailed engineering design,\nconsultant  recruitment, procurement, and  safeguards. More  programmatic  approaches  and\nvehicles such as project development facilities will also be developed. Output 3 will further draw\non best practices from ADB\u2019s institutional experience. It will prepare recommendations for (i) an\noperationalguideline withachecklistthat alignsexistinggovernment and ADBcycles,resources,\nand outputs for project preparation, approval, and start-up, and (ii) ways to improve existing\n10The risk assessments will be based on the Approach to Assessing Country and Sector Procurement Risk (September\n2013 draft) of ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department.", "5\nprocesses.11 Output  3 will optimize ADB's  and the  government's preparation and  start-up\nschedules for infrastructure projects.\n18. Output 4: Capacity development. The TA will provide capacity development for all\noutputs. For the use of CSS, capacity building is an integral part of the time-bound action plan(s)\nand will be targeted at national, subnational, and sector agencies. The approach to CSS will be\nto develop the most effective capacity development methods, which can then be scaled up. For\noutput 2, targeted capacity building will clarify and promote the use of harmonized procurement\nsystems. Capacity building related tooutput 3 will target BAPPENAS and line agencies.\nC. Cost and Financing\n19. The TA is estimated to cost $1,600,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant\nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The government will provide\ncounterpartsupport in the form of counterpartstaff,review of outputs,office space,workshop and\nconsultation support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are\nin Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n20. BAPPENAS will be the executing agency. Implementing agencies will include the Ministry\nof Public Works (Directorates of Human Settlements, Transport, and Water Resources), State-\nowned Power Company, National Public Procurement Agency, the National Land Agency, and\nthe Ministry of Environment. For the CSR, an ADB working group has been established.12The\ngovernment will set up (i) a TA steering committee for overall TA policy guidance, (ii) a CSS\nworking groupto assistthe CSR process, and(iii) technical working groups for outputs 2 and 3.\n21. The  TA  will  require  105 person-months  of  consulting  services (21 person-months\ninternational and 84 person-months national) over an implementation period of 19 months (6\nJanuary 2014 to 31 July 2015). Consultant recruitment will be through individuals and, for output\n1, throughthe combination of individuals and a firm using (i) quality- and cost-based selection at\na ratio of80:20 and (ii) a simplifiedtechnical proposal.Consultants will be engaged in accordance\nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The terms\nof reference are in Appendix 3. Procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement\nGuidelines(2013, as amended from time to time), andthe procuredequipment will be turned over\nto the government upon TA completion. TA funds will support workshops, capacity development\nactivities, and ADB CSR staff as resource  persons for  CSS  workshops  and  training.  All\ndisbursements  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Disbursement\nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to\nthe Government of Indonesia for Aligning Asian Development Bank and Country Systems for\nImproved Project Performance, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n11The recommendations and operations manual would also include relevant findingsfrom outputs1 and 2.Output 3\nwill also provide support to BAPPENAS with procedural recommendations to improve processes related to the Blue\nand Green Books duringthe RPJMN updating period.\n12In line with ADB\u2019s SPS, the CSR working group includes representatives from the Southeast Asia Department, Office\nof the General Counsel, and Regional Sustainable Development Department.", "6 Appendix 1\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK\nData Sourcesand\nDesign Performance Targetsand Reporting Assumptions and\nSummary IndicatorswithBaselines Mechanisms Risks\nImpact Assumption\nGreater By 2018.
