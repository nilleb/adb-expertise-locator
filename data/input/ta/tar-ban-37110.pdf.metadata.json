Although Bangladesh has significantly reduced poverty over the past decades, half of \nthe country\u2019s population \u2014some 63 million people\u2014 still live in poverty. The Government and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a partnership agreement on poverty reduction \n(PAPR) in April 2000, under which the Government adopted challenging targets in reduction of \nincome and human poverty. The Government also reiterated its commitment to achieve the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  by  completing  the  National  Strategy  for  Economic \nGrowth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development, or the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy \n(IPRS) in March 2003. Monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the strategy is an \nimportant component of the IPRS, which defines a matrix of poverty reduction tracking and \nmonitoring  indicators.    A  full-fledged  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (PRS)  is  scheduled  for \ncompletion by end-2004. \n \n2.  The Government has requested ADB to assist in establishing a poverty-monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) system, and strengthen government capacities for poverty M&E since the \nsigning of the PAPR, to ensure that its targets are being. In September 2002, the Department \nfor International Development (DFID, United Kingdom) endorsed the technical assistance (TA) \nconcept  for  funding  from  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  administered  by  ADB, \nincluding  assistance  in  developing  an  integrated  and  coordinated  framework  for  M&E  of \nprogress in implementing the PRS. Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken during January to \nMarch  2003  to  discuss  with  the  Government  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  financing  and \nimplementation arrangements.1 Further consultations with the Government to refine the TA \nscope were held thereafter. Other consulted key stakeholders included representatives of civil \nsociety, the private sector, and development partners. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The IPRS, envisages the establishment of an institutionally effective and technically \ncompetent poverty-monitoring unit (PMU) to monitor and assess poverty reduction goals.  The \nGovernment thus established a National Poverty Focal Point (NPFP) in the General Economics \nDivision (GED) of the Planning Commission in April 2003. The NPFP is designed to grow and \nfunction  as  an  institutionally  effective  and  technically  competent  PMU,  with  strong \ninterministerial linkages and interactions with various stakeholders outside the Government to \nmonitor and track the progress of PRS implementation. The PMU will also be the key agency in \npreparing  the  full-fledged  PRS  and  in  periodically  revising  the  medium-term  agenda. \nInstitutionalizing  the  NPFP,  and  ultimately  the  PMU,  and  establishing  a  sound  poverty-\nmonitoring framework will require sustained efforts of capacity building both within and outside \nthe Government. \n \n4.  The National Poverty Reduction Council (NPRC), chaired by the Prime Minister, has \nalso  been  formed  with  participation  of  ministers  and  secretaries  of  line  ministries  and \nrepresentatives of the civil society and the private sector, including academia and research \ninstitutes. NPRC\u2019s key objective is to address strategy and policy issues relating to the poverty \nM&E  work  of  NPFP,  which  is  the  NPRC  Secretariat.    Implementing  NPRC,  including \nestablishing the links and relationships with other institutions with similar mandates will also \nrequire capacity building and coordination among the relevant agencies and departments. \n \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 May 2003.  ", "2  \n5.  A recent institutional assessment2 of the poverty monitoring and coordination functions in \nBangladesh and lessons learned from similar ADB-supported initiatives provide the context and \nanalysis of the key challenges facing the Government in operationalizing the NPFP. First, \nestablishing  sound  systems  and  processes  to  regularly  integrate  and  publish  poverty \ninformation  will  require  capacity  building.  The  Bangladesh  Bureau  of  Statistics  (BBS)  is \nconducting several regular and ad hoc surveys, depending on needs and financing availability. \nHowever, these surveys are not based on comprehensive need assessments. Second, the \nroles,  responsibilities,  and  relationships  between  the  various  institutions  that  monitor  and \ncoordinate  poverty-related  functions  should  be  clarified.  The  NPFP\u2019s  smooth  functioning \nrequires  effective  links  and  coordination,  including  with:  (i)  other  ministries/agencies,  (ii) \nBangladesh Bank, (iii) BBS, (iv) Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, and (v) local \nconsultative group or sub-groups (LCGs).3 An incentive structure is also required to attract and \nretain GED staff, while the organizational structure within GED and the Planning Commission \nneed to be addressed in the longer term.  \n \n6.  To  ensure  that  the  poverty  targets  are  effectively  tracked,  IPRS  input,  output,  and \noutcome  indicators  need  to  be  incorporated  into  sector  agencies\u2019  strategic  framework. \nParticipatory consultations will be an integral part of the work of the NPFP\u2019s work before and \nafter the preparation of the full-fledged PRS and periodic revision of the medium-term agenda. \nGED\u2019s  capacity  to  design  and  mainstream  participatory  processes  is,  however,  extremely \nlimited. Consequently, capacity building for M&E of poverty trends will need to include: (i) \nassistance to clearly define NPFP\u2019s role; (ii) pilot-testing mechanisms to link NPFP with other \nstakeholders of the poverty reduction program, including the BBS; and (iii) support to the non-\ngovernment sector to conduct independent surveys to monitor, assess, and analyze poverty \ntrends.  The  TA  is  intended  to  be  the  first  part  of  a  medium-term  process  of  activities  to \nstrengthen NPFP capacity. Further support is expected from other development partners, while \nsome have already indicated interest in helping the Planning Commission, including the GED, \nmonitor and evaluate the national poverty reduction programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to strengthen the institutional capacity to monitoring and evaluate \nnational poverty reduction programs to make government poverty reduction measures more \neffective.  The TA will help the NPFP set up and implement an M&E framework, based on a \nclear  understanding  of  the  NPFP\u2019s  roles,  responsibilities,  and  relationship  with  other \nstakeholders, particularly NPRC, BBS, and key sector agencies, to help policymakers monitor \nprogress and make actions more effective and efficient.  \n \n8.  The TA outputs will be (i) institutional and coordination framework for poverty monitoring \nestablished, (ii) interim participatory poverty-monitoring mechanism (IPPMM) developed and \nimplemented, (iii) interim human resources development plan for the NPFP formulated and \nimplemented,  (iv)  participatory  consultation  process  developed  and  implemented  to  deliver \nIPPMM,  and  (v)  suitable  mechanism  for  civil-society  engagement  in  poverty  monitoring \ndeveloped and implemented. \n                                                           \n2  DFID.  2003.

The  TA  comprises  five  interrelated  key  activities  that  allow  for  consultation  and \nparticipation of stakeholders to implement NPFP and make it effective.  A mixture of specialist \nsupport  and  capacity-building  instruments  will  be  used  to  help  achieve  key  institutional \nmilestones. The approach will encourage ownership and accountability and create incentives for \ngood performance. The TA key-activities are described below. \n \n1.  Develop an Institutional and Coordination Framework \n \n10.  Key activities include the following: (i) define the core functions and levels of authority for \nthe  NPFP  to  allow  it  to  take  decisions  and  work  independently;  (ii)  establish  coordination \nfunctions for poverty monitoring with other agencies; (iii) implement NPRC and clarify its links \nand relationships with other institutions with similar mandates; (iv) develop mechanisms to \nmeasure and track NPFP and NPRC performance in the short and medium term, and suggest \nways to strengthening the NPFP and, ultimately, PMU in staffing, institutional arrangements, \nand logistics; and  (v) design and implement a system of working groups to deal with specific \nissues and establish interactive links with the LCGs on relevant areas.  \n \n11.  Assistance will initially be provided to identify and prioritize the NPFP\u2019s scope of work \nincluding preparation of the PRS, as the NPFP is the key agency to ensure timely preparation of \nthe PRS under the overall guidance of a national steering committee. The component will help \nthe NPFP, GED and NPFP national steering committee design and implement its activities in \nthe formative stage of its operation, and in coordinate and document meetings with ministerial \nthematic groups and civil-society groups to prepare a PRS. Initial support will include assistance \nto identify additional needs and develop a macro framework of actions to meet these needs with \nfurther external assistance. Successful implementation of these initial activities is instrumental to \ndevelop and institutionalize a comprehensive and efficient mechanism to ensure timely M&E of \nprogress.  \n \n2.   Develop an interim Participatory Poverty Monitoring Mechanism  \n \n12.  This component will include the following key activities: (i) produce a road map of key \nactions to conceptualize, refine, and develop implementable input, output and intermediate \nindicators, and outcome indicators to measure poverty trends and track progress; (ii) develop \nmechanisms in consultation with the relevant stakeholders to take stock of poverty data, take \nshort-term measures to meet the need for critical data to track key indicators, develop a data \ncollection strategy by identifying the most simple and effective  instruments, and design an \ninterim framework to monitor poverty; and (iii) prepare an outline of an annual report on poverty \nreduction and social development and analysis of observed trends and their policy implications. \n \n3.  Human Resources Capacity Building of National Poverty Focal Point \n \n13.  This component assumes that NPFP roles, responsibilities, and functions are clear, and \nincludes: (i) building consensus among the relevant decision-making authorities on the posts, \njob descriptions, skills mix, and recruitment plan of key personnel in line with the agreed-on \nmandate,  core  functions,  and  short-  to  medium-term  institutional  set-up  of  the  NPFP;  (ii) \nestablishing a core team of professionals for poverty analyses and monitoring, and an incentive \nstructure to encourage professionals to work in NPFP, including a simple and effective system \n ", "4  \nto monitor achievement of objectives for key personnel; and (iii) developing and implementing \nphase 1 of a capacity-building program to empower key personnel to meet their objectives, and \nidentify areas where external expertise and funding are required. \n \n \n \n4.  Develop and Implement Participatory Consultation Processes \n \n14.  This  component  will  include  the  following  activities:  (i)  develop  and  implement \nmechanisms for listening to the 'voices of the poor' on trends, possible impacts of pro-poor \nprojects, and policy support; (ii) developing NPFP capacity to undertake stakeholder analysis \nand participatory and consultation processes, and establish a consultation calendar by type of \nstakeholder  consultation,  purpose,  and  expected  output;  and  (iii)  establish  mechanisms  to \nsensitize key policymakers and development partners on the Government\u2019s PRS and progress \nmade through policy dialogues and interactions. \n \n5.  Encourage Civic Initiatives for Monitoring Poverty \n  \n15.  The component will include the following: (i) assess and develop suitable institutional \nmechanisms and funding arrangements for civil-society groups to monitor poverty trends and \nimpact; (ii) help organize civil-society groups engaged by NPRC to monitor poverty trends and \nimpact; and (iii) design and implement a capacity-building program for civil society groups. The \ncomponent  should  be  administered  by  a  working  group comprising  representatives  of  the \nGovernment and civil society, including academia and research institutes, to ensure that civic \ninitiatives  are  identified,  developed,  implemented  through  continued  civic  engagement  in \nmonitoring poverty. Costs associated with delivery of services provided by civil-society groups \nwill need to be assessed, and systems for sustainable civic engagement developed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, comprising $144,000 in foreign exchange cost \nand $296,000 equivalent in local currency cost.  ADB will administer a grant of $350,000 \nequivalent from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the \nbalance of $90,000 equivalent of the local currency cost by providing counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other related services and facilities. The detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  GED will be the TA Executing Agency.  NPFP will be the implementing agency. The \nGED member responsible for overall TA implementation will appoint a TA project manager, who \nis expected to be a senior GED officer, to oversee day-to-day TA activities. A TA project \nsteering committee will be established consisting of senior officials (from GED Bangladesh \nBank, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, BBS, External Relations Division, NPRC, \nFinance  Division,  and  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation  Division)  to  guide  and \ncoordinate on TA implementation. The TA manager will be assisted by qualified technical and \nsupport staff from GED.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over two years, from the first quarter of 2004 \nto March 2006. A team of three individual domestic consultants will be engaged for 6 person- ", "  5\nmonths  each  for  phase  I  (paragraph  10  under  component  1).  The  consultants  will  have \nbackground  in  development  economics,  social  science  and  political  science,  with  good \nknowledge of staff and institutional development in PRS design, implementation, and M&E in \nother  countries.  Research  assistants  will  also  be  engaged  under  the  TA  as  and  when \nnecessary,  to  assist  the  local  consultants  in  performing  the  assigned  tasks.  For  phase  2, \nmultidisciplinary  consultant  services  (8  person-months  international,  20  person-months \ndomestic) will be required. The team of consultants will have expertise in participatory poverty \nM&E  framework  establishment;  institutional  appraisal  and  institutional  development; \norganizational development; data analysis and data collection, and information management \nand reporting; and capacity building of civil-society groups. The consultants will be selected on \nan individual basis and will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  Equipment will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.  In phase I the consultants will submit a report at the end of the first quarter outlining the \ndetailed  activity,  and  a  final  report,  including  preliminary  analysis  of  each  task  and  likely \ndirections for the next phase at the end of the 6 months.  In phase 2 the consultants will submit \n(i) an inception report within 1 month after the TA starts, outlining key activities; (ii) six monthly \nprogress reports thereafter, summarizing key issues and outputs; and (iii) a draft final report, \nincluding recommendations for follow-up activities, 8 weeks before TA completion. The final \nreport will be prepared only after a tripartite review meeting of the Government, consultants and \nADB.  Consultants will procure equipment such as computers, software, audio-visual equipment \nand  other  training  materials  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  turn  over  the \nequipment to GED at the end of the consulting assignment. \n \nIV.

General \n \n1.  The main purpose of the two-year technical assistance (TA) is to help the Government \nestablish  an  interim  poverty  reduction  monitoring  framework  and  build  capacity  in  the \nGovernment,  civil  society,  and  other  institutions  to  monitor  and  evaluate  national  poverty \nreduction programs and associated efforts. The TA will be implemented in two phases. In phase \n1 (6 months), a team of three domestic consultants will help undertake initial activities to \noperationalize the National Poverty Focal Point (NPFP) of the General Economics Division \n(GED). In phase 2 (18 months), a team of international and domestic consultants will help the \nNational Poverty Reduction Council (NPRC) and the NPFP to establish and deliver an interim \npoverty monitoring framework (IPMF), comprising a coordinated cluster of poverty-monitoring \nsystems to monitor and evaluate the progress in implementing the national poverty reduction \nstrategy (PRS).  \n \n2.  The team of consultants for phase 2 will help stakeholders use a capacity-building and \nempowerment approach and ensure that the NPFP owns the project. The consultants are \nexpected to draw on international and regional good practices to establish a national IPMF and \nprovide direction and guidance on making it permanent.  The consultants must have experience \nin  helping  governments  and  stakeholders  design  and  implement  all  aspects  of  poverty \nmonitoring  through  a  national  framework  using  participatory  tools  and  processes.  The \nconsultants must also have experience in establishing relevant institutional, organizational and \nhuman resources systems, structures, and procedures to support the interim poverty-monitoring \nframework. One domestic consultant must have the skill to include civil-society organizations in \nthe design and implementation of national IPMF.  \n \n3.  The team will utilize process-consulting skills to ensure the NPRC, NPFP and other \nstakeholders are accountable for and own the IPMF.  The team will be required to empower \ncounterparts, NPRC members and NPFP staff using techniques and tools that will encourage \nlearning by performing core functions. The TA will focus on producing working models and not \njust a series of consultants\u2019 reports.  The team comprising international and national consultants \nmust be in country throughout the assignment through at least three in-country trips.  When not \nin the country, the international consultant must be able to provide ad hoc advice through E-mail \nand  Internet  facilities.    The  team  leader  (international  consultant)  will  monitor  and  report \nprogress every 2 months. \n \n4.  During the project\u2019s inception phase (up to two months) at the start of phase 2, the team \nof consultants will establish the working and reporting arrangements, including the counterpart \nstaff and nodal officers to deliver key TA components. The inception phase will set out the key \nhuman resource inputs from Government, civil society, and other relevant agencies required to \nensure that project outputs can be developed and delivered within the project time frame.  The \nfollow-up to the inception phase will begin when the human resource inputs are available for TA \nimplementation.  During the inception phase a process supported by a timetable of milestones \nwill  be  set  out,  process  management  and  flexibility  facilitated,  and  frequent  and  regular \nmonitoring ensured.  Government should agree on a timetable to establishing the NPRC and \nNPFP, and on a process to mitigate risks and save resources (including TA resources) should \nestablishment be delayed.  The precise team inputs will be developed for the first 9 months and \nupdated monthly to become a rolling annual consultant team resource and activity plan. Similar \nresources plans will also be required for government and civil society inputs.   ", "10   Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Consultants \n \n1.  Domestic Consultants (three, a total of 18 person-months for phase I)  \n \n5.  The consultants must have a background in development economics, social science, \npolitical science, and/or public administration, and preferably some knowledge of human and \ninstitutional development needed for developing a macro framework of actions to develop, \nimplement,  monitor,  and  evaluate a  full  poverty  reduction  strategy  (PRS).  The  consultants \nshould  be  familiar  with  poverty  diagnostics  and  strategies  of  poverty  reduction  in  different \ncountries and with institutional arrangements in the Government, and have skills in conducting \nand coordinating dialogues with different stakeholders, including civil societies. \n \n6.
