INTRODUCTION \n1.  During fact-finding for the project preparatory technical assistance to prepare the Tonle \nSap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project (the Project), the Government of \nCambodia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide complementary capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  technology  demonstrations  and  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  application  for  accelerated  growth  and  diversification  of \nagricultural production and improved access to markets. The ADB TA fact-finding mission visited \nCambodia from 25 February to 7 March 2008, and discussed the proposed TA for Tonle Sap \nTechnology Demonstrations for Productivity Enhancement. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2009 \nassistance program for Cambodia.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Agriculture  is  one  of  the  most  important  economic  sectors  in  Cambodia.  The  sector \ncontributed 30% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 and grew at an average \nrate of 7.7% per annum during 2005\u20132008. Although the sector\u2019s share in GDP has declined from \nan average of 38% over the past 4 years and the annual growth rate declined from 15.7% in 2005 \nto 5.0% in 2008, agriculture remains the primary source of employment and income for the vast \nmajority of the rural population, which makes up about 85% of the country\u2019s population. The sector \nis particularly significant for the Tonle Sap Basin, which is home to one-third of the country\u2019s \npopulation and covers 42% of the land area in Cambodia. \n \n3.  In the mid-1990s, the Government started to reform the  agriculture sector, when the \ncountry was transitioning from a centrally planned to a market economy. The sector\u2019s important \nrole in the national economy was enshrined in the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy2 that \nemphasizes  (i)  enhancement  of  the  agricultural  sector,  covering  improved  productivity  and \ndiversification of agriculture, land reform and clearing of mines, fisheries reform, and forestry \nreform;  together  with  (ii)  continued  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  physical  infrastructure; \n(iii) private  sector  growth  and  employment;  and  (iv)  capacity  building  and  human  resource \ndevelopment.  Sustainable  agriculture  and  rural  sector  development  has  been  at  the  core  of \npoverty reduction and economic growth in Cambodia and is in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic \nframework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 20203) and Operation Plan for Agriculture and Rural Development \nunder Strategy 2020,4 which support inclusive economic growth and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth.  \n \n4.  The  reforms  have,  so  far,  helped  Cambodia  to  achieve  food  self-sufficiency,  price \nliberalization, and an improved land law. The ongoing agriculture sector reform and development \naim  at  promoting  sustainable  growth  of  market-based  agriculture,  improving  agricultural \nproductivity, and divesting state-owned enterprises in the sector. However, the agriculture sector \nis still lagging behind because of interlinked binding constraints: (i) lack of secure and clear \nproperty  rights  (land  titles,  rule  of  law,  and  policy  transparency);  (ii) limited  access  to  good \npractices in agricultural production, markets, and timely and relevant information; and (iii) absence \nof proper irrigation and extension services. To intensify the agriculture sector, these constraints \nmust be addressed in the medium and long term.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 17 March 2008. \n2  Government of Cambodia. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The  TA  addresses  constraints  in  accessing  good  practices  in  agricultural  production, \nmarkets, and information. Traditional farming and production are carried out at the household level \nbecause of limited access to good practices in agricultural production, markets, as well as timely \nand  relevant  information  that  provide  a  useful  incentive  for  investment.  Together  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  initiatives  to  enhance  agricultural  productivity  from  various  perspectives,  as \nenshrined  in  the  Rectangular  Strategy,  improving  access  of  rural  households  to  production \ntechnologies and increasing access to information on technology, markets, socioeconomic, health, \nand environmental concerns through application of rural ICT will contribute to unleash the potential \nof smallholders and marginal farmers. In addition, these will help optimize economic and financial \nbenefits of current and future investment originating from both the public and private sectors, \nincluding rural households. \n  \n6.  Limited Access of Rural Households to Production Technologies. A significant part of \nthe rural poverty is caused by low agricultural productivity. This is being reinforced by the recent \nsoaring food, energy, and input prices that have further reduced the viability of the smallholder and \nmarginal farmers who are also net food buyers.5 Rural households continue to use low levels of \nproduction and processing technology that are familiar to them. Rural households\u2019 links with \nmarkets are weak. Farmers\u2019 knowledge of diversified farming technologies is also limited. The \nCambodia Agricultural Research and Development Institute; the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand Fisheries (MAFF); and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and several other public and \nprivate  organizations  are  the  main  source  of  rural  technologies.  Weak  capacity  and  lack  of \nresources have hindered the dissemination of many new technologies, so rural areas have not \nkept  pace  with  the  changing  demand  and  market  environment.  Farmers\u2019  limited  and  poor \nknowledge, in the absence of modern means of accessing information such as ICT, has hindered \nagricultural and rural growth and the advancement of Cambodian farmers compared with most of \nthe neighboring countries. The need to accelerate technology adoption is urgent to improve \nproduction and post-harvest management, covering new seed technology, cropping patterns, land \nand  soil  fertility  management,  water  management,  pesticide  and  fertilizer  management,  and \nproduct processing and marketing. \n \n7.  Lack of Access to Rural ICT. Best practices in rural ICT development and application\u2014in \ncountries  such  as  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  India,  Malaysia,  Viet Nam,  and \nelsewhere in the world\u2014have documented that improved access to ICT has been an important \ntool to alleviate poverty, especially for rural areas, where a very small percentage of the population \ncan enjoy its services. Through the use of ICT services, rural communities can find new income-\nearning opportunities, improve the delivery of basic services, and enhance their participation in \ndecision-making processes. Experiences in the PRC, Malaysia, and Viet Nam have indicated that \napplication  of  rural  ICT  using  the  model  of  community-based  e-centers  (CeCs)  has  been \nextremely  productive  as  public-access  facilities  providing  electronic  communication  services, \nespecially in marginalized or remote areas where ICT is not prevalent. They serve as avenues for \nproviding universal access communications and multimedia services to rural communities since \nthey  provide  access  to  telephones,  faxes,  computers,  the  internet,  photocopiers,  and  other \nequipment and services.  \n \n8.  Access of Cambodian farmers and rural people to information is essential to benefit from \nknowledge-intensive  production,  processing,  and  marketing  systems;  and  to  improve  their \ncompetitive advantage. By accessing timely and quality information, the entire production process \ncould be planned better based on market demand, thereby minimizing the risk of market failures. \nEffectively, the total cost of production could be minimized and competitive advantage achieved. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Manila. ", "  3\nDevelopment of rural ICT networks and support for rural people\u2019s access to ICT will, however, \nrequire  involvement  by  a  number  of  agencies,  including  NGOs  and  the  private  sector.  The \nNational Information Communications Technology Development Authority (NIDA), established in \nAugust 2000, coordinates ICT policy development and application. Mobile phone and internet \naccess have shown impressive growth, although most ICT infrastructure is concentrated around \nthe capital city of Phnom Penh; the provinces of Battambang, Kratie, and Kampong Cham; and \nrural areas along the Thailand and Viet Nam borders. The Government recognizes the importance \nand the need to support rural Cambodia access to ICT. The private sector and other development \npartners have pilot tested various initiatives to bridge the rural\u2013urban digital divide. The Ministry of \nPost and Telecommunications is implementing a World Bank-supported pilot ICT project to bring \nvoice telephone services to low-income families in remote areas of Banteay Meanchay, Odor \nMeanchay, and Preah Vihear provinces. All of these are expected to provide valuable learning \nexperiences.  However,  productive  use  of  ICT  in  rural  Cambodia  can  only  happen  when  (i) \navailability and access to digital technologies and voice and data communication infrastructure are \nensured; (ii) information contents are enhanced; and (iii) training, mobilization, and awareness \nbuilding are implemented through sound and viable partnerships among the public sector, private \nsector, and communities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The main impact of the TA is diversified and improved income of smallholders, marginal \nfarmers, and poor households in the Tonle Sap Basin. The expected outcome of the TA will be \nincreased access of smallholders, marginal farmers, and poor households to good agricultural \npractices, technologies, and information. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA is expected to produce two main outputs: (i) good agricultural practices and \ntechnologies demonstrated and training provided; and (ii) physical rural ICT facilities established \nfor pilot testing. The TA covers four provinces\u2014Banteay Meanchay, Kampong Cham, Kampong \nThom, and Siem Reap\u2014since they play a significant role in economic development of the Tonle \nSap Basin and the national economy. The upcoming Project6 will target these same provinces in \nits community interventions to improve rural livelihoods in the Tonle Sap Basin. Operational and \neconomic synergies, therefore, provide a strong rationale for the TA to cover the same provinces \nas the Project. In operational terms, the TA will put technologies in place for replication and \nscaling up under the Project. Detailed TA activities and criteria for selection of demonstration sites \nare in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n11.  Output 1: Good Agricultural Practices and Technologies Demonstrated and Training \nProvided. The TA will support demonstrations and training of good practices and technologies in \nagricultural production for (i) selected food crops, including long bean, mung bean, and tomato; (ii) \nenergy  crops  (Jatropha);  (iii)  selected  livestock,  including  cattle,  buffalo,  pigs,  and  poultry; \n(iv) selected fisheries, including rice fish together with pond aquaculture of tilapia, silver carp, \ncommon carp, and a small endogenous nutritive species; and (v) water management technologies \n(e.g., for farmer-owned and managed small-scale irrigation scheme). \n \n12.  Output 2: Physical Rural ICT Facilities Established for Pilot Testing. The TA will \nsupport pilot application of ICT in rural areas by establishing physical facilities, including e-kiosks \n                                                 \n6 The Project will be submitted for consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in the third quarter of 2009. \n ", "4   \n \nand CeCs and/or village information centers (VICs) with connectivity and content in selected \ncommunes.  \n \n13.  The TA support to rural ICT application will complement the first output, and facilitate \naccess to updated information and technologies\u2014including updates on new varieties; techniques \non crops, livestock, and aquaculture; disease outbreaks and prevention; and other socioeconomic, \nhealth,  and  environmental  concerns.  Moreover,  the  TA  support  to  rural  ICT  application  will \npromote universal access to communications and multimedia services for rural communities, and \ntrigger the development of the rural ICT market in the medium and long term. At the full-fledged \ndevelopment stage, physical facilities such as community e-kiosks, CeCs, and/or VICs will serve \nas virtual roads or communication highways that can benefit the rural communities as a whole. \n \n14.  The TA will develop and pilot test innovative approaches to public, private, and community \npartnerships in agricultural technologies and rural ICT development, with potential for replication \nand scaling up.7 The TA will review and incorporate lessons learnt from past and ongoing ADB \nassistance,  including  the  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program 8 to  ensure  appropriate \nselection  of  technologies  and  their  sustainability.  The  TA  will  also  support  monitoring  and \nevaluation (M&E) activities covering (i) collection of baseline data on performance indicators and \ntheir  monitoring;  (ii) documentation  of  lessons  during  TA  implementation;  and  (iii)  an  impact \nevaluation survey at the end of the TA. The executing agency is responsible for the M&E activities \nand will ensure the M&E results provide relevant lessons and experiences for replication and \nscaling up. The executing agency will also ensure that the M&E results complement design and \nimplementation of the (i) subprojects under the Project; (ii) regional TA on Rural ICT Policy \nAdvocacy, Knowledge Sharing, and Capacity Building;9 (iii) other projects in the ADB pipeline; and \n(iv) subsequent dissemination in other provinces. The TA will seek complementary assistance and \nalliance  with  NGOs  and  private  sector  entities,  especially  in  the  rural  ICT  development  and \nbioenergy (Jathropa) technology demonstration.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost an equivalent of $3,650,000, of which $250,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program (TASF-IV). The TA will be cofinanced \non a grant basis by the Government of Finland10 ($2,700,000 equivalent) and the Republic of \nKorea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund ($500,000 equivalent), and administered by ADB. \nThe Government of Cambodia will provide in-kind contribution of $200,000 through provision of \noffice accommodations, counterpart staff support, facilities for meetings, and part of local transport \ncosts. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from September 2009 to August 2012. The \nMAFF, the executing agency, will be responsible for overall coordination, reporting of the TA and \nimplementation of Output 1. NIDA will be the implementing agency for Output 2. An interagency \nTA coordinating committee (TCC), chaired by a designated MAFF secretary of state, will be \nestablished  and  will  convene  quarterly  to  provide  overall  policy  guidance  on  the  TA \n                                                 \n7  A number of private ICT companies have shown interest in participating in the Government\u2019s effort to develop rural \nICT services. \n8  ADB. 2003.
