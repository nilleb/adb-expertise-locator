The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested that the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  a  railway  emergency \nmanagement  system  study.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  PRC  in  June  2007  and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  terms  of \nreference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA is included \nin the ADB 2007 country program for the PRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2006, \nthe PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth, which resulted in a corresponding rapid \nincrease in demand for transportation. The annual growth of passenger transport was 9% and \nthat of freight transport was 7.6% during the 1978\u20132005 period. In 2005, road traffic accounted \nfor 53.2% of total passenger-kilometers (km), followed by railways with 34.7%, civil aviation with \n11.7%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%. The modal split for freight ton-km was \n61.3% for coastal and inland waterways, 26.5% for railways, 11% for roads, 1.1% for pipelines, \nand 0.1% for civil aviation. \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport in the \nPRC, and the rapid economic growth has resulted in a corresponding high demand for railway \ntransportation. At the end of 2006, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised 77,000 route-km and \nannually carries about one third of the total freight and passenger traffic in the PRC. Between \n1978 and 2006, railway freight grew from 535 billion ton-km to 2,172 billion ton-km, equivalent to \nan  annual  growth  rate  of  5.1%.  Passenger  traffic  grew  at  6.6%  annually,  increasing  from \n109 billion passenger-km to 666.2 billion passenger-km.  \n \n4.  The Government's policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the capacity of the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-venture local \nrailways to promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety \nof the existing system by using new technology and modern management tools in planning and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  the \ncommercialization  of  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related  services.  \n \n5.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) identified railway development as a priority. By \nthe end of the Plan, an investment of CNY308 billion had been made for capital construction, \nwhich included (i) constructing 6,458 km of new lines; (ii) providing 3,275 km of double lines; \nand (iii) electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. The Railway Development Plan (2004) seeks to expand \nthe railway network to 100,000 km by 2020. \n \n6.  The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) continues to emphasize railway development, \nand seeks to speed up railway construction. The plan envisages (i) constructing 17,000 km of \nnew lines with the network length reaching over 90,000 route-km; and (ii) increasing the length \nof the double lines and electrified lines to reach 45% of the network length. The plan seeks to (i) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 January 2007. \n ", " 2 \nbuild a dedicated passenger railway network by constructing passenger dedicated lines, (ii) \ndevelop coal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of existing lines, (iii) expand the \nrailway network to 34,000 km in the poor western region, (iv) build international corridors at the \nborders in the southwest and northwest, and (v) develop a countrywide intermodal container \nnetwork. The total estimated investments are CNY1.5 trillion or about $190 billion over the next \n5-year period. \n \n7.  ADB's strategy for the PRC railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system \nby constructing new lines in unserved areas that are less-developed and poor; (ii) promoting \nenergy conservation and environmental sustainability and/or promoting regional cooperation; \n(iii) modernizing equipment, enhancing safety, and increasing the capacity to improve transport \nefficiency on key routes of the national railway system; (iv) commercializing railway operations \nto sustain efficient operations; and (v) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport sector \nthrough restructuring and reform.  \n \n8.  ADB,  the  lead  development  partner  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  has  focused  on \ndeveloping railways in less-developed inland provinces to promote growth and reduce poverty. \nADB provided 14 loans, totaling about $2.9 billion, to finance the construction of about 1,921 km \nof provincial railways and 5,541 km of national railway projects. The World Bank has provided \n11 loans totaling over $2.6 billion since 1984 for (i) 10 national railway projects to expand \nrailway capacity on high-priority corridors, modernize system-wide technology, and strengthen \ninstitutional capabilities; and (ii) one local railway project. Japan is the major source of external \nfinancing in the PRC railway sector. Since 1979, it has provided about Y558 billion for 15 \nrailway projects to expand rail transportation capacity.   \n \n9.  Policy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway \nsector and has effectively complemented the lending operations. Since 2002, there has been an \nactive engagement in policy dialogue and discussion with the Ministry of Railways (MOR), \nNational Development Reform Commission (NDRC), and Ministry of Finance (MOF) and there \nis a broad agreement  on reforms as an engine to further development of railways in the \ntransport sector. Thirteen TA grants to PRC railways since 1989 have been for policy reforms, \ninstitutional  development  (local  railways,  dedicated  passenger  lines),  strengthening  of \ncommercial and business operations, marketing and business development, tariff setting with \nimproved cost recovery, developing human resources, and improving financial management \nand accounting systems. ADB policy dialogue continues to emphasize further progress in those \nareas.  In  recent  years,  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  been  emphasizing  enhanced  safety, \nenvironmental sustainability, and energy conservation.  \n \n10.  Safety  is  an  important  aspect  of  reliable  transportation  and  critical  to  providing  a \ncompetitive, high-quality, and safe mode of transport to people and goods. As PRC railways \nhave modernized and introduced new concepts and technologies, safety needs have changed. \nADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  emphasizes  the  need  for  higher  standards  of  safety  in \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  Since  2003,  ADB  has  supported  investments  in \nrailway safety as part of ADB financing. ADB initiated dialogue on adopting a sector-wide \napproach on safety rather than a project-based approach. Adopting a sector-wide approach is \nconsistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in the PRC and helps in \nproviding economies of scale, and better management of emergencies, preventive maintenance \nand accidents. ADB is working closely with MOR to develop a comprehensive plan emphasizing \n ", "    3 \ninstitutional, investment, and training needs of MOR. ADB is proposing to finance a Railway \nSafety Enhancement Project ($100 million) in 20072.  \n \n11.  An important element of the sector-wide approach to safety is the management of \nvarious  kinds  of  emergencies,  disasters,  and  accidents  at  different  levels  of  management \n(ministry,  railway  administration,  and  railway  station).  MOR  has  an  established  system  of \nhandling railway accidents at the three levels. However, the system to deal with emergencies \nand natural disasters like earthquakes, typhoons, or other natural calamities is in a nascent \nstage. It was only after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 that \nMOR for the first time planned the setting up at the national level of a mechanism to deal with \nnatural disasters and major emergencies such as earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural \ncalamities. MOR made a beginning in 2005 by establishing an emergency management office \ndirectly under the control of the Minister (as part of the Minister\u2019s office). In 2006, an emergency \nmanagement center was established under the transportation department.  \n \n12.  Simultaneously,  the  pace  of  modernization  and  technological  development  in  PRC \nrailways has quickened. In April 2007, train speeds were raised to 200 km/hour (h) and 250 \nkm/h after the sixth speedup. In 2008, the Beijing\u2013Tianjin dedicated passenger line, with a \nspeed of 300km/h, will be put into operation. Train speeds on dedicated passenger lines will be \nincreased to 300\u2013350 km/h by 2010. Trains with higher trailing loads have been introduced on \nthe  Daqin  railway  line.  MOR  seeks  to  introduce  double-stack  container  operation  under \nelectrified traction on the Shanghai\u2013Chengdu corridor by 2012.  \n \n13.  All  these  developments,  combined  with  the  critical  role  played  by  railways  in  the \neconomic  development  of  the  country  and  the  demand  for  high  standards  of  safety  and \nreliability, have imposed new challenges for MOR. Managing emergencies and crises on a \ntechnologically advanced high-speed railway system is a new concept for PRC railways, and \nmanaging such a network is different from managing the conventional railway system. MOR has \nlittle or no experience in emergency and crisis management and therefore seeks to learn from \ninternational experience and best practices. Given this background, the Government and MOR \nrequested ADB assistance in researching and learning from best international practices on \nemergency management systems in advanced railway systems in developed countries and help \nin adapting them to PRC railways.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the proposed TA is an efficient, safe, reliable, and competitive railway \ntransport system developed in the PRC.  The outcome of the TA will be a plan for an efficient \nand effective railway emergency management system (EMS) that can be adopted by MOR. The \nTA will (i) review the current practices adopted by MOR for managing railway emergencies; (ii) \nresearch best international practices and experiences in railway EMSs; and (iii) recommend \nactions for developing an efficient and effective railway EMS, which should be realistic for the \nGovernment and MOR to implement. Appendix 1 gives the design and monitoring framework.  \n                                                 \n2  This is part of Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway and Railway Safety Enhancement Project ($250 million) included in the \nADB 2007 country program for the People\u2019s Republic of China. ", " 4 \nThe study will make use of experience in other railways and involve the active participation of \nrailway management.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  To achieve the objective, the consultants will (i) compare and analyze the EMS in \ndeveloped  countries  such  as  Japan,  France,  and  Germany  by  (a)  reviewing  the  working \nprinciples, mechanism, system, institutional structure, and methodology of EMS in each of those \ncountries, and (b) identifying the comparative advantages of each system through a strengths \nand weaknesses analysis that will include reviewing the features, performance, and experience \nof  using  these  systems;  (ii)  recommend  regulations,  rules,  working  principles,  mechanism, \ninstitutional  structure,  methodology,  technology,  maintenance  practices  and  needs,  and \npersonnel and training needs for an EMS that can be adopted in the PRC; and (iii) provide \ncapacity-building support through international and domestic training and knowledge transfer. \nThe consultants will make use of experience in other railways (international), involve active \nparticipation of railway management, implement domestic and international training programs, \nand recommend a set of actions that can help MOR to set up an efficient and effective EMS for \nPRC railways. The recommendations should be realistic for the Government and MOR to \nimplement.  \n \n16.  The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, MOR, and other \nrelevant agencies. The study will build on ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue. It will consider all \nprevious  studies  by  the  Government,  ADB,  World  Bank,  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development, other multilateral agencies, and bilateral agencies. The TA will \ninvolve research; fieldwork; training; and stakeholder consultations with the Government, the \nprivate sector, user groups, and international development partners. \n \n17.  Key activities will include a review of existing studies by MOR, the Government, and \nother multilateral institutions; data analysis; and consultation with other stakeholders. Capacity- \nbuilding support will be provided through an international training program and a domestic \ntraining  program,  with  participation  from  relevant  departments,  to  learn  from  international \nexperiences  and  best  practices  of  railways  overseas.  Workshops,  one  each  at  inception, \ninterim, and draft final report stages of TA implementation, will be organized to discuss and \nreview the findings of the study, and a seminar will be organized at the final report stage to \ndisseminate TA findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program \nwill finance the TA on a grant basis in the amount of $500,000. MOR will finance the remaining \n$130,000 equivalent, which will be used to cover office accommodation and the counterpart \nstaff required to implement the TA. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MOR, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. A leading group comprising representatives of relevant departments of MOR will be \nset up to oversee implementation and provide guidance and direction to the consultants. In \naddition, MOR will appoint a project coordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-day \n ", "    5 \nTA  activities,  including  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and \nliaising with the government agencies concerned. To facilitate the work of the consultants, and \nto ensure that MOR benefits from their experience, MOR will provide adequate counterpart staff \nwith relevant work experience during TA implementation. MOR will also provide policy guidance \nto the consultants. Workshops and a seminar will be held to review findings at the inception, \ninterim, and final stages of the TA. These meetings will include representatives of MOR, MOF, \nother  relevant  agencies,  ADB,  and  the  consultants.  A  final  report  will  be  published  at  TA \ncompletion. \n \n20.  A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB using simplified technical proposal procedures \nand the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for engaging national consultants. The TA will require about 14 person-months of \ninternational and about 9 person-months of national consulting services to carry out the terms of \nreference (Appendix 3). The international consultants will have expertise and experience in the \nfollowing fields of railway transport relating to emergency and crisis management systems: (i) the \nconcept, organization, working principles, mechanism, design and implementation; (ii) network \ndevelopment and management, information and communication systems, and technical issues; \nand (iii) regulation, rules, and institutional issues. The national consultants will have expertise and \nexperience in the following fields of railway transport relating to emergency management and \ncrisis  management  systems  in  the  PRC:  (i)  concept,  organization,  working  mechanism;  (ii) \nnetwork management, information and communication systems, and technical issues in the PRC; \nand (iii) regulation, rules, and institutional issues. The TA is expected to begin in November 2007 \nand  be  completed  by  May  2008.  Procurement  of  equipment,  supplies,  and  materials  by \nconsultants under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The equipment will be turned over to MOR after TA completion. \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
