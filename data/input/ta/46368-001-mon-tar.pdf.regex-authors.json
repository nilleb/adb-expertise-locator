INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) was developed following initial discussions between the \nGovernment of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in November 2011 and May \n2012, and the receipt of a formal request from the Bank of Mongolia on 31 May 2012. Pursuant \nto consultations between the East Asia Department and the Office of the General Counsel, a \nreconnaissance mission was fielded on 3\u20135 July 2012 and a fact-finding mission was fielded on \n5\u20136 September 2012. The aide-m\u00e9moire of the fact-finding mission has been confirmed by the \ngovernment. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A key constraint in the anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism \n(AML/CFT)  regime  in  Mongolia  is  the  level  of  capacity  in  its  law  enforcement  agencies, \nprosecutors,  and  judiciary  in  the  investigation  and  prosecution  of  money  laundering  and \nterrorism financing offenses.  \n3.  Based on discussions with the various authorities, first, it is noted that concerns exist \nregarding  the  influx  of  illegal  money  from  abroad  during  the  current  vibrant  economic \ndevelopment. The authorities are generally concerned about the need to address the new \ntrends  and  typologies  of  potential  illegal  activities  in  Mongolia  in  addition  to  the  range  of \nproceeds of illegal activities that may be laundered in Mongolia, such as corruption, smuggling, \nand tax evasion.2  \n4.  Second, a lack of a common understanding appears to exist on how to approach money \nlaundering offenses. This is due to uncertainty regarding the elements of the money laundering \noffense in the criminal code. While work is ongoing on the revision of the money laundering \noffense, the general view of the authorities is that a common understanding of the approach to \nthe  money  laundering  offense  is  important  for  investigation  and  prosecution  of  money \nlaundering activities detected by the authorities. The authorities have fewer concerns about the \nterrorism financing offense, as terrorism financing activities appear to be less prevalent in \nMongolia. Capacity constraints remain, given the nature of terrorism financing (which is different \nfrom traditional crimes) and the proposed TA will take this into account.  \n5.  Third, some of the authorities recognize that there should be specialized investigators \nand  prosecutors  for  economic  crimes,  including  money  laundering  and  terrorism  financing \noffenses. There should, at any rate, be training for officers engaged in these activities, as the \nlegal and evidentiary issues and investigation techniques involved are different from those for \ntraditional crimes. Moreover, such training should be systematic given the capacity constraints \nacross the authorities.  \n6.  More generally, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has identified Mongolia as a \ncountry with strategic deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime, given its level of compliance with \nAML/CFT international standards. Other areas of weakness are deficiencies in the formulation \nof the money laundering and terrorism financing offenses in the criminal law and the capacity of \nthe  financial  regulators  in  overseeing  AML/CFT  compliance,  for  which  the  government  is \nreceiving  support  from  other  development  partners  and  donors.  Mongolia  is  one  of  the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2012.  \n2  Asia/Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering.  2007.  APG  Mutual  Evaluation  Report  on  Mongolia. \nhttp://www.apgml.org/documents/docs/17/Mongolia%20Mutual%20Evaluation%202007%20-%20Final%20.pdf \n(para. 44). \n ", "2   \n22 countries on the so-called \u201cgrey list\u201d issued by the FATF3, which means that parties wishing \nto do business in Mongolia are required to pay special attention to risks related to money \nlaundering and terrorism financing, which increase the transaction costs. It has also agreed an \naction plan with the FATF for addressing the deficiencies. \n7.  The weaknesses in Mongolia\u2019s AML/CFT regime are material, as it is regarded as a \ncountry with significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks (footnote 2, paras. 39\u2013\n59).  For  example,  corruption,  smuggling,  and  tax  evasion  have  been  identified  as  crimes \ngenerating significant proceeds in Mongolia. Similarly, there were suggestions that Mongolia \nmay be a staging post for drug trafficking in the region. Mongolia also has a predominantly \ncash-based economy and a large informal sector, which makes it more vulnerable to money \nlaundering and terrorism financing risks.   \n8.  There  have  been  some  investigations  of  money  laundering  and  terrorism  financing \noffenses, but no successful prosecution to date. This is why the broad range of authorities that \nhave responsibilities for AML/CFT think that systematic capacity development in investigation \nand prosecution is important for Mongolia at this stage. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will provide systematic capacity development for the authorities responsible for \ninvestigation and prosecution of money laundering and terrorism financing offenses. These \nauthorities are primarily the Bank of Mongolia, the General Police Department, the General \nIntelligence Agency, the Independent Authority Against Corruption, the General Prosecutor\u2019s \nOffice, and the judiciary. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be an enhanced AML/CFT regime for Mongolia. This will \ncontribute  to  Mongolia  being  taken  off  the  FATF  \u201cgrey  list,\u201d  provided  that  other  areas  of \nweakness are addressed. The outcome of the TA will be government authorities with better \ncapacity, both within individual authorities as well as part of the national AML/CFT efforts, to \ncarry out investigation and prosecution of money laundering and terrorism financing offenses. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support capacity development for about 40 officers from the participating \nauthorities over 2 years. These officers will be trained in  money laundering and terrorism \nfinancing trends and typologies, investigation techniques, legal and evidentiary issues, and case \npreparation for investigation and prosecution, which will be applied in their operational work. \nAbout 10 such officers (selected based on good performance on the program) will participate in \na short secondment to their counterpart agencies in a suitable ADB member country. The TA \nwill  also  support  preparation  of  a  paper  on  the  issues  and  challenges  in  the  design  and \nimplementation of an AML/CFT capacity development program using Mongolia as an example.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 equivalent, of which $360,000 will be financed on \n                                                \n3  Financial Action Task Force. 2012.

The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, organization of \nconferences  and  workshops  (including  the  costs  of  venues  and  meals  as  well  as  the \naccommodation and transport costs of the participants) and printing of training materials, and \nother in-kind contributions. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Bank of Mongolia will be the executing agency and responsible for coordinating with \nthe other participating authorities in the implementation of the TA. \n15.  The TA will support the use of four individual consultants for a total of about 9 person-\nmonths (two international consultants) and 4 person-months (two national consultants). A pair of \ninternational and national consultants will cover the legal aspects of the capacity development \nprogram. A pair of international and national consultants will cover the law enforcement aspects \nof the capacity development program. These consultants will design the capacity development \nprogram in consultation with the government and ADB. Training and hands-on mentoring will be \ndelivered by the consultants in Mongolia. The international consultants will also prepare a paper \non  the  issues  and  challenges  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  AML/CFT  capacity \ndevelopment program using Mongolia as an example. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. These consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n16.  The TA will also support a short secondment for 10 participants (selected based on good \nperformance on the program) to their counterpart agencies in a suitable ADB member country. It \nwill  also  cover  the  costs  of  interpretation  and  translation,  and  other  miscellaneous  costs. \nDisbursement under the TA will be in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n18.
