With the enactment of the new Electricity Law in November 2004, the Government of \nViet  Nam  initiated  a  far-reaching  power  sector  reform  program.  The  Government  has \nincorporated the key recommendations of TA 3763-VIE1 into the reform strategy and has \nrequested  further  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nimplement the initial steps of the reform strategy. The proposed TA was included in the Viet \nNam Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132006) as the Power Sector Restructuring \nAdvisory TA, and at the request of the Government it has been replaced by the Power Market \nDesign Advisory TA.2 Fact-finding was undertaken in May 2005, and the mission reached \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  scope,  approach,  cost  estimates,  and \nimplementation arrangement for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As  a  result  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  of  more  than  7%  per  year, \nincreasing industrialization, and low initial per capita consumption of electricity, the growth in \ndemand for electricity has averaged more than 14% per year during the past decade and a \nsimilar growth rate is expected in the medium term. Electricity sales in 2010 are forecast to be \n100 to 112 terawatt-hours, with peak demand of 17.5 to 19.5 gigawatts (GW), compared with \nelectricity sales of 40 gigawatt-hours and peak demand of 8.3 GW in 2004. To meet this rapid \nincrease in the demand for power, installed capacity needs to be increased from 10.8 GW in \n2004 to 22.6 GW by 2010. The total investment requirement for the power sector for 2004\u20132010 \nis estimated to be $19.0 billion, with power generation alone requiring $11.8 billion. The main \nchallenge facing the power sector is mobilizing adequate financial resources without adversely \naffecting the sector\u2019s financial viability.  \n \n3.  State policy for the sector as enunciated in the new Electricity Law is to develop a power \nmarket based on principles of transparency and competition to achieve economic efficiency, to \nattract investments from both state and nonstate sectors to the sector, and to ensure legitimate \nrights for the sector\u2019s consumers and investors. The law further states that the state\u2019s monopoly \nin the sector will be limited to power transmission, national load dispatch, and strategically \nimportant large power plants, leaving power distribution and nonstrategic power generation to \npotential  private  sector  investors.  The  law  specifically  encourages  investments  by  foreign \nprivate sector investors and joint ventures between foreign investors and domestic enterprises \nin the power sector. To give effect to these objectives, the Ministry of Industry (MOI) is entrusted \nwith establishing a competitive power market.  \n \n4.  The power sector is currently dominated by Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN), a state-owned \ncooperation that accounts for more than 85% of power generation, bulk power transmission, \nand power distribution either directly or through intermediaries in some rural areas. EVN is \norganized into strategic business units, with the units engaged in power distribution considered \nto be independent accounting units, that is, profit centers, while transmission and generation \nunits  are  viewed  as  dependent  accounting  units,  that  is,  cost  centers.  Private  sector \nparticipation in the sector is limited to a couple of large natural gas-based thermal power plants \nand several small oil-fired thermal and hydropower plants. Several other power generation \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Roadmap for Power Sector Reform. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 20 May 2005. \n ", " 2   \nprojects are under construction that have been developed by state-owned enterprises other \nthan EVN.  \n \n5.  According to EVN\u2019s draft corporate restructuring plan,3 EVN-owned power plants would \nbe converted into independent accounting units, that is, profit centers, and some EVN-owned \npower plants would be equitized, namely, partially privatized. The Government is contemplating \npublic offerings through the stock market as well as direct sales to strategic investors. However, \nEVN is proposing to retain three large, multipurpose hydropower projects with a combined \ncapacity of 3,000 MW (30% of installed capacity at present) as dependent units. The four \ntransmission units currently structured as dependent units of EVN would be merged to form a \nwholly-owned EVN subsidiary that would own and operate the transmission network. EVN\u2019s \nstakes in the equitized provincial distribution utilities would be held through the seven existing \nregional  power  companies.  These  regional  power  companies  would  be  converted  from \nindependent  accounting  units  to  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of  EVN.  EVN\u2019s  cooperate \nrestructuring program is expected to be completed by 2008. \n \n6.  The road map for electricity market establishment and development prepared by MOI for \nthe prime minister\u2019s approval envisages that the corporate restructuring of EVN will establish the \nnecessary conditions for initiating of the power market. The first phase of the proposed road \nmap is to set up an internal pilot market for EVN-owned power plants and the power plants in \nwhich EVN holds a dominant share. Existing independent power producers (IPPs) and the three \nstrategic multipurpose hydropower plants will not take part in the internal market. The IPPs will \nbe dispatched according to the power purchase agreements between EVN and the IPPs. During \nthe first phase, the market rules as well as the regulatory, technical, and commercial institutions \nand capacity required for operating the second phase of the proposed power market (a single \nbuyer-based competitive generation market with the participation of non-EVN power plants) \nwould be developed and pilot tested.  \n \n7.  The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) for the power sector would be established \nwithin MOI as a separate institution. The key functions of the ERA during the first and second \nstages will include (i) issuing licenses to sector entities and enforcing them; (ii) advising the \nminister of industry on market structure and industry restructuring policy; (iii) establishing the \ntariff-setting principles, including transfer pricing between sector entities; (iv) developing tariffs \nfor regulated activities; (v) approving the power purchase agreements of the single buyer; (vi) \nensuring  the  procurement  of  adequate  new  generation  and  transmission  capacity;  (vii) \nmonitoring the progress of implementation of new generation and transmission projects; and \n(viii) monitoring the functioning of the power market. The Electricity Law does not clearly define \nthe enforcement mechanism for regulatory actions and expectations are that the official decision \nestablishing the regulator will clarify the enforcement powers of the ERA. \n \n8.  During the first and second phases of the proposed power market, the competition will \nbe  only  among  the  sellers,  that  is,  power  plants.  The  single  buyer  will  sell  electricity  to \ndistribution companies and large consumers at regulated prices. EVN\u2019s internal power market \nhas started in the second half of 2005, with the competitive generation market starting in 2009. \nOne of the key issues is the degree of independence of the single buyer and the system \noperator from the rest of EVN in the event that EVN continues to own and control a significant \nstake in equitized power plants. This will require transparent rules for market operation, for \n                                                 \n3  ADB loan covenants pertain to the EVN corporate restructuring. ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Northern \nPower Transmission Sector Project. Manila. (Loan 2128-VIE, approved on 13 December 2004, for $120,000,000.) \n ", "                        3\ndispatching of power plants, and for settlement and appropriate regulatory oversight. If these \nconditions cannot be guaranteed, the single buyer and the system operator will have to be \nseparated from EVN.  \n \n9.  The responsibility for planning and procuring new generation capacity will be transferred \nto the newly set up single buyer and ERA. As the agency responsible for steering the reform \nprocess and for managing the sector on behalf of the state, MOI is expected to ensure that \nadequate generation capacity is procured to keep pace with the rapid increase in the demand \nfor power. The contractual arrangements for the new generation capacity to be procured during \nthe first phase from the state as well as from nonstate entities will have to be consistent with the \nfunctioning of the proposed competitive generation market in the second phase. One of the key \nchallenges is to provide adequate reassurance to potential investors in the context of ongoing \nreforms and an incipient power market without compromising the flexibility required in power \npurchase agreements for effective functioning of the proposed power market. \n \n10.  The power sector is a key area for ADB assistance to Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s past investments \nin  the  sector  focused  on  power  transmission  and  distribution,  whereas  future  investment \nprojects are likely to be in power generation. These investment loans have been accompanied \nby TA and policy dialogue to improve the sector\u2019s efficiency and the investment climate for \nprivate sector investors. The proposed TA will provide strategic advice to the Government \nduring the initial phase of implementation of the road map, which was prepared based on ADB \nTA  3763.4 It  is  envisaged  to  provide  further  assistance as  the  Government  proceeds  with \nestablishing the power market. It will aim at developing market instruments for the evolving \npower market and at institutional capacity building for market entities such as the regulatory \nagency, the system and market operator, and others.  \n \n11.  The power market reform program during 2006\u20132010 consists of (i) setting up the power \nmarket and designing market rules for a single buyer market, (ii) establishing the regulating \nagency  for  the  sector,  (iii)  undertaking  the  corporate  restructuring  of  EVN  to  meet  the \nrequirements of a single buyer market, and (iv) procuring new generation capacity consistent \nwith a least-cost power development plan. These activities need to be carried out in a consistent \nand coherent manner, and slippage in any of these activities would affect the effectiveness of \nthe reform program.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed TA focuses on (i) designing the market structure, (ii) devising a framework \nfor regulatory instruments and market rules, and (iii) preparing guidelines for procuring new \ngeneration capacity. The main purpose of the TA is to provide guidance to the Government in \nmaking strategic decisions regarding the market structure, the role of EVN and its subsidiaries \nand  the  relationship  among  these  entities,  the  nature  of  the  regulatory  regime  and  key \nregulatory mechanisms, and the terms of power purchase arrangements for new power plants \nand equitized power plants. \n \n13.  The main outcome of the TA would be a series of technical papers addressing these \nissues in the context of Viet Nam\u2019s specific circumstances and current Government policy for \nthe  sector.  These  papers  will  be  discussed  with  relevant  Government  counterparts  and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Road Map for Power Sector Reform. \nManila. (TA 3763-VIE, approved on 6 November 2004, for $400,000.) \n ", " 4   \nstakeholders, including international development agencies active in the sector, before they are \nfinalized.  The  TA  will  (i)  recommend  general  structuring  of  the  power  sector  to  meet  the \nrequirements of a competitive generation market, (ii) design the market structure for competitive \ngeneration market, and (iii) design the regulatory framework for the competitive generation \nmarket.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The structure of the electricity sector industry in the future will depend largely on the \nproposed restructuring of EVN, because EVN is currently the dominant entity in the industry. \nHence the proposed strategy for the corporate restructuring of EVN is critically important to the \nsuccess of the proposed electricity market. The consultants will propose the extent to which \nEVN\u2019s generation assets should be separated from the rest of EVN; the maximum equity stake \nEVN should have in the nonstrategic generation units, if any; and the number of generation \ncompanies to be set up to own power plants currently owned by EVN prior to the establishment \nof  the  competitive  generation  market.  These  proposals  will  take  Viet  Nam\u2019s  specific \ncircumstances  into  account.  The  ownership  and  management  structures  for  the  strategic \nmultipurpose hydropower projects such as Hoa Binh will be proposed taking specifics of these \nprojects  into  account  and  the  concerns  of  relevant  nonpower  stakeholders.  The  proposed \nprogram for equitizing EVN\u2019s generation assets will be reviewed in the context of investors\u2019 \ninterest in sector and capital market development in Viet Nam.  \n \n15.  EVN\u2019s National Load Dispatch Center and Power Market Department are expected to \nevolve into the system operator and market operator and the single buyer, respectively. The \nconsultants will make recommendations regarding the structure and ownership of the single \nbuyer and the system operator and market operator and whether these entities could remain \nwithin EVN or whether they should be independent of EVN. In the event of the Government \ndeciding to keep the single buyer and the system operator and market operator as part of EVN, \nthe consultants will make recommendations for addressing the potential conflicts of interest \ncaused by EVN\u2019s ownership stakes in power generation through regulatory oversight, firewalls, \nand other measures.  \n \n16.  The consultants will review experience with EVN\u2019s internal market, which was set up in \nJuly 2005, and draw lessons that could be helpful in the design of the competitive generation \nmarket with the participation of non-EVN power plants. The consultants will determine the \ndetailed set of prerequisites required to move from the EVN internal market to the competitive \ngeneration market. This will include (i) the progress of EVN\u2019s restructuring program; (ii) the \nprogress in establishing key market entities, such as the regulatory agency, the single buyer, \nand the system operator; and (iii) the finalization of the basic framework for key market tools, \nsuch  as  grid,  settlement,  and  bidding  codes.  The  consultants  will  identify  the  additional \nrequirements to be met before a balancing market, that is, a spot market,5 is introduced to the \ncompetitive generation market. \n  \n17.  ERA is expected to be adequately staffed with competent personnel, and the regulatory \ninstruments  will  be  prepared  prior  to  the  transition  to  the  competitive  generation  market \nsupported by follow-up TAs. The TA will also recommend key aspects of the regulatory regime \nfor  the  competitive  generation  market.  This  will  involve  defining  how  the  regulator  should \nexercise  its  powers  under  the  Electricity  Law  and  the  relevant  decrees  for  regulating  the \n                                                 \n5  A market mechanism whereby generators submit bids on a daily basis to supply electricity and meet the demand \nnot covered by long-term contracts between generators and the single buyer.  \n ", "                        5\nfunctioning of the market and the performance of key market institutions, such as the single \nbuyer, the system operator, and the transmission company. The intent is to provide a level \nplaying field for the competing generators, including regulatory oversight in monitoring the \ndispatching of power plants. The framework for information flow between market players and \nthe regulator and the templates for licenses to be issued to market players will be developed \nunder the TA. The TA will also define mechanisms for regulatory approval of power purchase \nagreements for new plants and for power plants that are being equitized. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is $420,000 and the local currency cost is $205,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost \nand $80,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent of \nlocal currency costs through in-kind contributions by the executing and implementing agencies \nof office accommodation and facilities, local communication facilities, and counterpart staff. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will require about 18 person-months of international consulting services and 18 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. An international consulting firm will be recruited \nby MOI using the quality- and cost-based selection method based on a simplified technical \nproposal in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. This TA is not envisaged to involve any procurement. The TA will be \nimplemented over an 8-month period commencing in March 2006 and ending in October 2006. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. MOI will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA and ERA, when established, will be the implementing agency. The \nGovernment and ADB have agreed to include this TA as one of the projects under the pilot \nstudy for the delegation of consultant recruitment and supervision to MOI.6  \n20.  MOI will set up a working group consisting of representatives of the main stakeholders \nand a donor coordinating committee to provide feedback on the main outputs of the consultants. \nThe key outputs of the TA will be presented to the stakeholders in the form of a series of \nworkshops and the feedback received will be incorporated into the final recommendations. The \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has offered to finance a resident adviser to help MOI \nimplement the initial work program to set up market institutions and undertake capacity building \nand training of employees of key institutions involved in the proposed power market. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.

Implementation of the technical assistance (TA) will require the services of a team of \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  power  system  operation,  power  markets,  regulation  of  power \nmarkets, and Viet Nam\u2019s commercial law. An international firm of consultants will be engaged for \nthis assignment and will be expected to work with the domestic consultants to be recruited by the \nMinistry of Industry. The international firm of consultants will propose the international experts for \nthe assignment and the domestic consultants to be recruited by the Ministry of Industry. The \nconsultants are expected to undertake consultations with Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) and with \nnon-EVN stakeholders in the sector, which consist of independent power producers (IPPs) and \ndevelopers of new IPPs, fuel suppliers, domestic and international financiers of IPPs, and large \nconsumers. The feedback received will be discussed with policy makers and will be included in \nthe consultants\u2019 recommendations as appropriate.  \n \n \nA.   Recommendation  on  General  Structuring  of  the  Power  Sector  to  Meet  the \nRequirements  of  a  Competitive  Generation  Market  (international consultant: senior \npower sector reform specialist and team leader [4 person-months]; domestic consultant: \nViet Nam power sector expert [4 person-months]) \n \n2.
