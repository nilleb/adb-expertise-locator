THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The project will support rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation and drainage \nnetworks serving about 23,230 ha of land in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic (NAR) of \nAzerbaijan. The project will also help strengthen institutional capacity of the irrigation system \nmanagement and operators. The project will include two indicative outputs: (i) irrigation and \ndrainage infrastructure improved and/or constructed; and (ii) capacity of the State Amelioration \nand Water Management Committee (SAWMC) and water users associations in irrigation and \nproject management improved. These outputs will result in the following outcome: irrigation and \ndrainage system performance in NAR improved. The project will be aligned with the following \nimpact: agriculture production and productivity increased as outlined in the strategic agriculture \nsector roadmap of the Government of Azerbaijan.1  \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost about $100.0 million, of which Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is requested to finance $85.0 million through its ordinary capital resources in regular terms, \nor 85% of the total project cost; and the balance is expected to be contributed by the government. \nThe  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  the  ensuing  loan  were  not  included  in  the \nAzerbaijan country operations business plan, 2020-2022, but will be included in the next country \noperations business plan for Azerbaijan.2 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The  transaction  TA  will  support  the  government  to  conduct  sector  and  capacity \nassessment, and to prepare feasibility studies and implementation startup for the ensuing project. \nThese studies will include technical, environmental, social, gender, and economic and financial \ndue diligence assessments. The feasibility study report for the entire project and advance design \nfor the irrigation and drainage schemes for the first-year implementation will be prepared in \naccordance with the format and content that satisfy the requirements of ADB and the government \nin loan processing and approval. A TA grant of $1.2 million and about 18 person-months staff \ntime will be required to prepare the ensuing loan project.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1  Center for Analysis of Economic Reforms and Communication. 2017. Strategic Roadmap on Production and \nProcessing of Agricultural Products in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Baku. \n2  The project has been included in the COBP under the title of Integrated Infrastructure Development Project (on standby \nin 2022). Subsequent discussions with the government led to a revision of the project scope that resulted in the change \nof the project title and the possible advancing of the delivery of the ensuing loan to 2021. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 September 2019. \n ", "2 \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.

Cost and Financing \n \n5.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,335,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). Key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  1.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office space and access to internet, necessary data and information, facilitation \n ", "3 \nof liaison with stakeholders during project preparation, and other in-kind contributions. The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n6.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  will  select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants. SAWMC will be the executing agency responsible for overall \ncoordination and management of the TA implementation and provide necessary counterpart \nsupport to the TA consultants. SAWMC will establish a project management office to take care of \ndaily administration of TA activities and preparation of ensuing investment project.  \n \n7.  The overall TA implementation period will be about 22 months from February 2020 to \nDecember 2021. The TA consulting services will be implemented in two phases from May 2020 \nto December 2021. The first phase, from May to August 2020, will (i) conduct rapid performance \nassessment of the current irrigation system and identify key weaknesses and constraints in the \nNAR; (ii) carry out hydrologic and hydraulic modelling to assess various water sources and \nwhether remodeling of the canal networks is required; (iii) assess whether there is a need to \nincrease pumping capacity and/or canal flow capacity; and (iv) recommend project scope for \ndetailed feasibility studies. The second phase, from September 2020 to December 2021, will then \nconduct full-fledged feasibility studies for irrigation and drainage schemes identified in the first \nphase to meet both government and ADB requirements, advance design of the irrigation and \ndrainage  schemes  for  the  first-year  implementation,  and  first  year  project  implementation \npreparation support. \n  \n8.
