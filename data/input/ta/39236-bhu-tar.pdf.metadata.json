INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Bhutan (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  provide  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (the  TA)  project  to  assist  the \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) in formulating new approaches to accelerate rural electrification \n(RE). The TA is included in Bhutan: Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010).1 A mission \nvisited Bhutan on 9\u201316 November 2005 to formulate the TA and reach an understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  With a total installed capacity of about 468 megawatts (MW)3 and a maximum domestic \ndemand of 116 MW, Bhutan is a net power exporter. The energy sector accounts for about 12% \nof gross domestic product (GDP) and provides the Government with about 45% of its total \nrevenue.  An  additional  1,020  MW  is  expected  to  be  produced  in  2006  following  the \ncommissioning of the Tala hydropower project; it is therefore expected that, by the end of 2007, \nthe  energy  sector  will  be  responsible  for  more  than  60%  of  the  Government\u2019s  revenue. \nHowever, Bhutan\u2019s mountainous terrain and the difficulty in expanding the RE network have \nheld the country\u2019s electrification rate to only about 50%. Since so much of Bhutan\u2019s revenue \ncomes from electricity sales to India, the Government is strongly committed to expanding RE so \nthat all of Bhutan\u2019s citizens can benefit from it. The Vision 2020 policy document has a target of \n100% electrification by 2020. Accordingly, under the current Ninth Five-Year Plan, 2002\u20132007, \nthe Government intends to electrify 15,000 households. This will increase the total number of \nconsumers by about 20% and the percentage of the national population with electricity by 8%, \nto 53%. An even more ambitious program of rural electrification is expected in the Tenth Five-\nYear Plan, where a target of 25,000 households has been set.  \n \n3.  Currently, DOE is the government agency charged with planning and coordinating RE. \nDOE also plays a small role in RE implementation, overseeing the implementation of off-grid \nrenewable energy systems (e.g., solar photovoltaic [PV] systems, micro and small hydropower \nstations with small grids). The Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) is the main implementer of RE \nthrough the expansion of the national grid, but other government agencies, the private sector, \nand the communities themselves will need to be involved if the objective of 100% electrification \nby 2020 is to be met. \n \n4.  In fact, several acts call on various government agencies, as well as the private sector, \nto be involved in RE. The Electricity Act 2001 dictates that \u201cthe Minister shall undertake to \npromote,  support  and  provide  rural  electrification  through  public  and  private  participation\u201d \n(Article  61.1).  The  Decentralization  Act  2002  (Chhatrim  2002)  calls  for  the  gewog  yargay \ntshogchu  (GYT)  (block  development  committee)  to  \u201cadminister,  monitor,  and  review  the \nmaintenance of community micro hydels\u201d (Article 9.2) and invests the GYT with \u201cfinancial power \nto  approve  of  rates  of  locally  generated  power\u201d  (Article  10.7).  The  Chhatrim  2002  further \nrequires the dzongkag yargay tshogdu (DYT) (district development committee) \u201cto give direction \nand  approve  rural  electrification  schemes  in  accordance  with  the  Electricity  Act  2001\u201d \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

BPC runs several mini hydro stations and \ndiesel generation stations. \n ", "2   \n(Article 10.9)  and  the  dzongkag  (district)  administration  to  \u201cimplement  rural  electrification \nschemes\u201d (Article 13.7). \n \n5.  Recent developments have shown that this may be the right time to increase the number \nof entities involved in RE implementation. An RE master plan4 completed in November 2005 \nclearly identifies the villages where the provision of electricity via grid extension is technically \nand economically feasible, and the villages that are good candidates for renewable energy such \nas  community-based  micro  hydropower  and  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  systems.  With  the  RE \nmaster  plan  in  place,  the  job  of  parceling  out  responsibilities  for  the  expansion  of  RE \nimplementation  has  been  made  much  easier.  Efforts  to  engage  the  private  sector  and \ncommunities have also started. However, the RE master plan, greater use of renewable energy, \nand the use of the private sector and communities for RE are just the first steps in accelerating \nthe implementation of RE. A more comprehensive and structured strategy and action plan is \nneeded. DOE is especially looking for ways to engage the dzongkags and gewogs (blocks or \ngroups of villages) as partners in RE implementation. This TA is expected to provide valuable \ninput on RE for the Tenth Five-Year Plan and for future ADB loans for RE. \n \n6.  ADB is Bhutan\u2019s main development partner in power sector restructuring, distribution \nreforms, and rural electrification expansion. ADB strongly supports the Government\u2019s efforts to \nexpand rural electrification and ensure the overall efficiency of the power sector, and has been \nassociated with power sector reforms in Bhutan from the start (1993\u20131994). These reforms \nhave been rated \u201cvery successful.\u201d5 In 1998, the Government and ADB agreed to implement a \nseries of TA projects to restructure and strengthen the power sector over 8 years. In 2002, the \nGovernment  unbundled  the  Department  of  Power  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  sector \nagencies. Under the present structure, (i) DOE is the policy-making and planning body of the \nGovernment, (ii) Bhutan Electricity Authority (BEA) is the sector regulator, and (iii) BPC is the \ntransmission, distribution, and supply company. This reorganization was a significant step in \nimproving sector efficiency and service delivery. ADB is now engaged in building the capacity of \nthe sector agencies. A recently completed TA explored the possibility of establishing the Druk \nHydropower Corporation,6 an umbrella company that would own all the hydropower stations, \nthus creating significant economies of scale. Two ongoing TAs are concerned with the capacity \nbuilding of BEA and BPC.7 In addition, under the Ninth Five-Year Plan, 8,000 households will be \nequipped with electricity with the help of a loan from ADB. \n \n7.   Besides ADB, the Sustainable Development Secretariat (funded by the Government of \nthe Netherlands) is assisting the electrification of about 3,000 rural households, and the Austrian \nCoordination  Bureau,  about  1,000  rural  households.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency supported the preparation of the RE master plan. The Japan Bank for International \nCooperation  has  expressed  interest  in  rural  electrification.  The  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment Cooperation is helping the DOE strengthen BEA. The Government of India is \nsupporting the development of an integrated energy master plan with emphasis on renewable \nenergy, and is the primary source of assistance in tapping Bhutan\u2019s hydropower potential, \nfinancing the Chukkha, Kurichhu, and Tala hydropower projects. \n \n                                                 \n4  Fukuchi, Tomoyasu. 2005.

The TA is designed to improve the overall efficiency of the power sector and expand the \ncoverage of rural electrification. It will achieve this goal by (i) developing new approaches to \naccelerating RE through the involvement of other government agencies, the private sector, and \ncommunities;  (ii)  pilot-testing  private  sector  or  community-based  models  for  RE;  and \n(iii) conducting training, building capacity, and raising awareness of how they may be involved in \nRE  among  district  and  block  development  planners,  development  consultants,  private \nentrepreneurs, and contractors. The TA will develop the necessary policies and institutional \nframework to expand rural electrification, and help prepare a sector loan for rural electrification \nand renewable energy that is programmed for 2008. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  In line with these expected outcomes, the TA will have three components.  \n \n(i)  Component 1: New approaches to accelerating RE through grid expansion. \nIn  this  component  the  TA  consultants  will  study  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization  policies,  as  well  as  its  plans  for  enabling  district  and  block \ndevelopment entities, rural communities, and the private sector to take on the \nchallenges of development, especially rural electrification. The consultants will \nthen  recommend  models  for  involving  the  various  levels  of  government,  the \nprivate sector, and communities in RE, specifying the roles of these entities and \ntheir motives for participation. These models should include a wide range of \noptions including but not limited to, cooperatives, energy supply services for solar \nPV and micro hydro power, outsourcing of billing and collection, and operation \nand maintenance of distribution systems (up to 11 kilovolts). The activities in this \ncomponent  will  lead  to  recommendations  on  how  the  various  levels  of \ngovernment, the private sector, and communities can be involved in RE. The new \napproaches will be pilot-tested, and then adopted and replicated, taking into \nconsideration the lessons learned.  \n \n(ii)  Component  2:  New  approaches  to  accelerating  RE  through  off-grid \nrenewable energy use. In the past, Bhutan\u2019s efforts to expand RE were biased \nin favor of grid extension. DOE now wants to use more off-grid renewable energy \nfor  RE,  and  needs  to  develop  the  policies,  institutional  arrangements,  and \napproaches for this. The TA consultants will therefore review the RE master plan \nand integrated energy master plan, and assess ongoing activities related to the \nuse of renewable energy for RE. They will then recommend models for using \nrenewable energy (solar PV, micro hydro, biomass, and other forms) in RE, and \nspecific policies, incentives, institutional arrangements, etc., that must be put in \nplace to facilitate such use. The new approaches will be pilot-tested.  \n \n(iii)  Component  3:  Training,  capacity  building,  and  awareness-raising.  The \nactivities  in  this  component  will  pertain  to  raising  awareness  of  how  other \ngovernment agencies (especially district and block governments), development \nconsultants,  private  entrepreneurs  and  contractors,  and  communities  can  be \ninvolved in RE. Targeted workshops and seminars will be held to present the \nfindings  of  component  1.  Study  tours  will  also  be  made  to  observe  rural \n ", "4   \nelectrification programs in neighboring countries like Nepal, with its community-\nbased renewable energy program, and Bangladesh, with its rural electrification \ncooperatives. These study tours will be specifically for local government officials \nand community leaders. The private sector will be invited to participate but those \nwho join will be required to cover their own expenses. Apart from this awareness-\nraising program, the TA consultants will develop a regular outreach program for \nDOE to keep up the awareness-raising activities even after the TA. \n \n10.  The main role of the international consultants will be to bring knowledge, experience, \nand international best practices to Bhutan. Their main responsibilities will be in situation analysis \nand program formulation. They are expected to transfer their knowledge and experience to the \ndomestic consultants. The main responsibilities of the domestic consultants will be to (i) collect \ndata, (ii) organize and lead the consultations with the stakeholders, (iii) ensure that stakeholder \ninputs are included in program formulation, (iv) oversee the implementation and monitoring of \nthe outcomes of the pilot projects, and (v) ensure that the recommended programs are realistic \nand can be implemented. \n \n11.  All components will be carried out in consultation with the various stakeholders to ensure \nthat their inputs are considered in formulating and implementing models for participation in RE. \nIn components 1 and 2, the consultants will suggest several models and present these to the \nrelevant stakeholders (government agencies and various levels of government, private sector, \nand communities) in separate groups. Once the models have been thoroughly discussed and \nthe stakeholders\u2019 inputs obtained, the consultants will formulate specific models in greater detail. \nConsultation with the stakeholders will continue during the detailed design. The consultants will \nthen prepare a framework for the expansion of RE, which will include the new approaches, \ninstitutional requirements, and economic and financial analyses of sustainability.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is about $875,000 equivalent. Part of this cost will be financed \non a grant basis as follows: (i) $300,000 from the Government of Finland, and (ii) $400,000 from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will administer the grant from the Government of Finland. The \nremaining  $175,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  will  be  contributed  in  kind  by  the \nGovernment of Bhutan. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  DOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and a steering committee will be formed \nbefore  the TA,  with  senior  representatives  from  relevant  ministries and  agencies  from  the \nnational, district, and block levels of government, the private sector, and communities. The \nsteering committee, to be chaired by the director general of DOE, will provide overall direction. \nThe planning and coordination head of DOE will be the project director and will oversee the day-\nto-day implementation of the TA. A task force will be formed for each of the three components. \nThe task forces will be made up of staff from relevant ministries and agencies from the national, \ndistrict,  and  block  levels  of  government,  the  private  sector,  and  communities.  The  project \ndirector  will  appoint  three  senior  DOE  officers  to  be  the  project  managers  for  the  TA \ncomponents. The DOE director general will see to it that these senior DOE officers are made \navailable. DOE will also provide office space and coordination support to the consultants.  \n \n14.  The formation of the steering committee and task forces is essential to the success of \nthe TA. Since the main output of the TA is the involvement of other government agencies, the \n ", "  5\nprivate sector, and communities in RE, these stakeholders must provide inputs on how this \npartnership is to be formed and carried out. The steering committee will meet every 6 months. \nThe task forces will meet at least every 3 months, or more often if needed. \n \n15.  The consultants are expected to implement the TA in four phases.  \n \n(i)  Phase 1. The consultants will work closely with the task forces in developing \ndetailed  implementation  plans.  The  detailed  implementation  plan  for  each \ncomponent will be part of the inception report and should be completed within 3 \nweeks of project start-up. The consultants will also (a) review relevant legislation \nand  policy  documents;  (b) assess  the  capabilities  of  DOE,  BPC,  and  other \nrelevant government agencies; and (c) look into ongoing efforts by DOE and \nBPC to engage other government agencies, the private sector, and communities \nin RE.  \n \n(ii)  Phase 2. The consultants will formulate various models for RE and the outreach \nand  awareness-raising  program.  Consultations  will  be  held  with  various \nstakeholders in Thimphu and elsewhere in the country. Phase 2 will result in a \nset of recommendations for expanding RE.  \n \n(iii)  Phase 3 will consist of the implementation of the pilot projects and study tours.  \n \n(iv)  Phase 4 will involve assessing the lessons learned from the pilot projects and \nmaking the necessary changes in the models.  \n \n16.  The consultants will also prepare a report every 6 months to (i) document the work done; \n(ii) discuss any significant issues; and (iii) make the necessary changes in the implementation \nschedule. After completing their tasks under the TA, they will prepare a final report giving details \nof the implementation and outputs. All reports will be submitted to DOE and ADB in draft form \nfor review and comment, and the final report incorporating the comments will be submitted in \nelectronic and hard copies. \n    \n17.  The TA will be carried out over 24 months, from July 2006 to June 2008. It will require 14 \nperson-months of international and 36 person-months of domestic consulting services. The \ninternational consultants will be expected to spend 90% of their time in the field. The expertise \nrequired and outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be required to submit \nsimplified technical proposals and will be selected using the quality- and cost-based method. \nProcurement of any equipment under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Bhutan for \nAccelerated Rural Electrification, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved energy sector efficiency  25,000 households  Department of  \u2022  Continued \nand expanded coverage of rural  electrified under the Tenth  Energy (DOE)  commitment by the \nelectrification  Five-Year Plan   statistics  Government to \n       power sector \n  RE expansion and  DOE and Bhutan  reforms including \noperation and  Power Corporation  power sector \nmaintenance costing less  (BPC) data  restructuring for \nthan $2,000 per    greatest efficiency \nhousehold   \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nMore entities engaged in rural  Other government entities  DOE data  \u2022  Interest of other \nelectrification (RE) to accelerate  (besides DOE) involved    government \nits expansion  in implementing RE   agencies, private \n    sector, and \nNumber of private  communities in \nentrepreneurs involved in  implementing RE \nRE   \n \nNumber of community-\nbased RE schemes \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
