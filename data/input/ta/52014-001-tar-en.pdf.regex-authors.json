INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the design and \nimplementation of integrated flood risk management (IFRM) solutions and enhance knowledge \nand application of IFRM strategies in Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member \ncountries (DMCs).1 The TA will provide targeted support for program and project preparation, and \npromote more holistic, basin-scale IFRM solutions that incorporate nonstructural and nature-\nbased solutions (NBSs).2 These will deliver greater sustainability and long-term effectiveness, \nincluding adaptive capacity to climate change, urbanization, and human interventions, thereby \nincreasing resilience. \n \n2.  The TA is included as a firm 2018 project in the Water Sector Group (WSG) 2018\u20132019 \nwork plan approved by ADB Management.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Increasing flood risks. Asia and the Pacific faces increasing risks from water-related \ndisasters such as floods, droughts, rainstorms, and landslides. Frequent and severe floods are \nalready  causing  significant  loss  of  life  and  property.4 In  2017  alone, Asia  and  the  Pacific \nexperienced 5,125 flood and storm-related deaths, and reported $35 billion in losses from \ndisasters,  of which 96% are flood and storm-related.5 About 13% of the world\u2019s urban population \nlive in large cities in low-elevation coastal zones, rendering them highly exposed to floods; Asia \nhas an even higher concentration.6 Many Asian coastal cities are also confronted with land \nsubsidence from uncontrolled water abstraction for water supply, storm surges, and probable \nclimate-change-induced sea-level rise. \n \n4.  Without improved institutional coordination, proper responses, and suitable investments, \neconomic losses from floods in key areas such as agriculture, energy, transport, health, water, \nand tourism are expected to increase significantly, making poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment more difficult to achieve. \n \n5.  Traditional responses. Flood mitigation civil works have been the primary focus of flood \nrisk management, with an emphasis on evacuating floodwater as quickly as possible or storing it \ntemporarily by protecting developed areas through structural measures such as dams or levees. \nHowever, complete flood mitigation is not always technically feasible, desirable, or economically \njustified, and localized structural solutions without a wider basin approach can also exacerbate \nflooding in other parts of the basin. Piecemeal flood risk reduction approaches can also create \nimpact inequalities, contribute to ecological degradation, and may be less adaptable to new \ncircumstances induced by land-use and climate changes. \n \n \n                                                \n1  IFRM\u2014a specific focus within integrated water resources management\u2014is a process that promotes the coordinated \ndevelopment and management of water resources to maximize economic and social welfare equitably without \ncompromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. \n2  NBSs means using nature in tackling environmental and societal challenges. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 June 2018. \n4  2017.

Global Report on Human Settlements 2011: Cities and \nClimate Change. London: Earthscan. \n ", "2 \n6.  New approaches. A more comprehensive and integrated approach, taking a basin or \ncatchment perspective that includes NBSs is gaining conceptual acceptance among flood risk \nand water management professionals.7 This IFRM approach incorporates social, economic, \nfinancial, environmental, and institutional aspects, as well as engineering, disaster preparedness, \ninsurance, and emergency response requirements. IFRM rests on the principle that land use \nplanning and water management should combine structural and nonstructural measures to \nmanage water and achieve flood mitigation together with other benefits. This approach (i) reduces \nflood hazards by managing water using a basin-wide approach and integrating NBSs where \nappropriate;  (ii)  mixes  strategies  to  limit  exposure  to  floods,  combining  infrastructure  with \nnonstructural and nature-based or climate-resilient and -adaptive solutions; (iii) regulates land use \nto integrate land and water management into a single plan; (iv) raises awareness among \nstakeholders to ensure a participatory approach; (v) includes flood preparedness measures; and \n(vi) reduces residual risk through response and recovery plans and ex ante IFRM financing \ninstruments. This integrated approach may also consider the flood, wastewater, and solid-waste \nmanagement nexus. \n \n7.  While recognizing the need to adopt such approaches in rural and urban areas, some \nDMCs still need technical support for introducing integrated approaches and international best \npractices in their flood risk management and climate change adaptation strategies. IFRM is also \nan area where innovation is needed to meet increasing investment demand from DMCs. \n \n8.  Lessons learned. Multiple regional and national capacity development TA projects have \nlaid the groundwork for IFRM implementation in several countries.8 ADB support has included (i) \nbroad capacity and institutional development activities in Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Nepal; (ii) \ninterventions  related  to  disaster  risk  management  in  Armenia,  Bangladesh,  Fiji,  and  the \nPhilippines; and (iii) sponge city approaches in the People\u2019s Republic of China.9 Overall findings \nsuggest  that  continuous  efforts  are  needed  to  promote  and  integrate  innovative  flood  risk \nmanagement approaches into ADB operations to effectively reduce flood risks in its DMCs. \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly for the operational priorities that \ninvolve (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; (ii) making cities more livable; and (iii) promoting rural development \nand food security.10 It supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020, \nwhich identifies flood resilience as a key priority; Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020; Operational \nPlan for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020; and Climate Change Operational \nFramework, 2017\u20132030.11 The TA will contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \n                                                \n7  World Wildlife Fund. 2017.

The evaluations will seek to assess \nthe effectiveness and sustainability of current structural and nonstructural interventions. Output 2 \nwill (i) conduct an analysis to fill existing gaps; (ii) engage and train national and local stakeholders \nduring the analyses, modeling, and assessments as part of the broader program of work identified \nto strengthen IFRM; and (iii) assess options to establish accessible and reliable data platforms \nthat support the use of the required data by all relevant stakeholders. These could cover data, \nmethodologies,  and  mapping  requirements  for  risk  levels,  emergency  planning,  community \npreparedness,  institutional  arrangements  and  relevant  policies,  and  engagement  with \ndevelopment partners. Climate risk and vulnerability assessments will be conducted as necessary. \n \n14.  The geographic scope of the evaluations in the eligible DMCs17 will be selected based on \nthe ADB operations departments\u2019 initial assessment of flood vulnerability and potential flood \nlosses, the relevance of pipeline projects, government interest, and the priorities of the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF).18 Potential opportunities for ADB engagement \nin IFRM in each DMC will be identified. In collaboration with ADB operations departments and \nDMCs, the TA will carry out (i) an IFRM analysis for selected basins and areas in the participating \nDMCs, including flood hazard mapping, if feasible; and (ii) economic analyses of structural and \nnonstructural interventions to develop an IFRM-based program of interventions and policy reforms \nfor the selected basins and areas.19 \n \n15.  Output  3:  Integrated  flood  risk  management  concepts  integrated  into  ADB \ninvestments. Output 3 covers technical support to integrate innovative IFRM approaches into the \ndesign of at least three integrated flood management investment projects to be selected from the \nassessment  conducted  in  output  2.  The  projects  will  be  identified  with  ADB  operations \ndepartments,  based  on  demand  from  the  DMCs.  Output  3  deliverables  are  expected  to \ncomplement ongoing or planned transaction TA projects from the operations departments that \nwill help prepare and integrate the IFRM interventions.20 IFRM solutions will cover structural and \nnonstructural measures, with emphasis on resilience and NBSs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $3.0 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUCCRTF under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB.21 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The WSG Secretariat of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will lead TA administration in coordination with \nADB operations departments, including team membership in the selected countries. ADB will \nobtain written no-objection from the relevant DMC before conducting or financing any TA activities \n                                                \n17 These are Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n18 Study areas will be decided with the DMC and may cover catchment, city, or country. Preference will be given to \nareas associated with the 25 UCCRTF priority cities. ADB proposes to use the Spatial Data Analysis Explorer, a \nweb-based geospatial data repository, in support of the TA outputs. The repository was developed under ADB TA \n(ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Promoting Urban Climate Change Resilience in Selected Asian Cities. Manila). \n19 An appropriately leveled IFRM analysis must take into consideration data availability and resolution, as well as a \nDMC\u2019s ability to mainstream the IFRM methodology into government policies and strategies. \n20 The TA will make sure that traditional local methods of flood risk adaptation are considered to promote their \nacceptability and ownership by affected communities. \n21 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n ", "5 \nin that DMC\u2019s territory.
