Demand  for  electricity  in  Thailand  increased  by  an  average  of \n3.6% per year during 2005\u20132016. Total electricity consumption was 182,846 gigawatt-hours in \n2016, up 4.6% from 174,834 gigawatt-hours in 2015. As of April 2017, Thailand\u2019s installed power \ngeneration capacity was 41,393 megawatts (MW). Production of electricity depends heavily on \nfossil fuels:  60%  is generated from  natural gas, 10% from  lignite,  and  8% from  coal.  Although \nrenewable energy sources currently contribute only 8%, the Government of Thailand\u2019s promotion \nof alternative energy under the Alternative Energy Development Plan, 2015\u20132036 is expected to \nincrease renewable energy capacity to 19,684 MW (30% of total capacity) by 2036, with 6,000 \nMW coming from solar power and 3,002 MW from wind power.3 The plan, prepared as part of the \ngovernment\u2019s  strategy  to  diversify  the  energy  mix  and  promote  renewable  energy,  notes  the \nsignificant  potential  of renewable  energy  in Thailand  and  indicates  that  energy  imports  can  be \navoided by developing domestic renewable energy projects with private investment. \n \n3. \nCountries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) face a rapid increase \nin energy demand, driven by socioeconomic factors such as rapid population growth, sustained \neconomic  growth,  growing  urbanization,  an  expanding  middle  class  population,  and  increased \naccess to electricity. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \nelectricity consumption by countries in the ASEAN region will grow 8.04% per year during 2009\u2013\n2030.  This  poses  major  challenges  to  achieving  and  balancing  energy  policy  objectives  in  the \nregion, including energy security, sustainable development, energy access, and affordability. \n \n4. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  opportunity  of  providing  financial \nassistance to B.Grimm through close cooperation and strong relationships built over the last ten \nyears with key players in Thailand\u2019s energy sector, with the goal of (i) implementing the Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 and its country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Thailand, which \nemphasize  support  for  clean  energy  and  environmentally  sustainable  growth;4 and  (ii)  helping \nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which seek to substantially increase the share of \nrenewable energy in the global energy mix.5  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n5. \n \n \n\nProject design.

The outcome will be: sustained operation of private sector power projects in \n\n7. \nImpacts.  The  project  will  contribute  to:  (i)  regional  progress  ensured  in  increasing  the \nshare of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030;6 and (ii) the energy mix diversified \nthrough  the  addition  of  alternative  energy  capacity  and  more  electricity  consumption  from \nrenewable sources.7 \n \n8. \nthe ASEAN region and other DMCs. \n \n9.  \nand other DMCs. \n \nC. \n\nOutput. The output will be the rollout and operation of power projects in the ASEAN region \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n10. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 (footnote 4) in promoting environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment, assisting the private sector in meeting growing energy demand in the region, and \ncapitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in infrastructure development, finance, and other areas. \nThe midterm review also supported the expansion of environment-friendly technologies for clean \nand efficient energy generation and use, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of \ninfrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for various ADB DMCs echo the themes of \nthe energy policy, including the promotion of environmentally sustainable economic development \nand energy security. \n \n11. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.8 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of \n$6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources in the clean energy segment. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n\n12. \n                                                 \n6  In support of Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (footnote 5). \n7  In support of the Alternative Energy Development Plan (para. 2). \n8  ADB. 2009.

By  working  with  a  well-established  energy \ncompany with a strong track record of successful execution, ADB will be able to extend its reach \nto multiple energy and renewable power projects that would be difficult to assist directly. ADB\u2019s \nassistance will play an important role not only in providing direct financing but also in attracting \nthird-party  investors  and  establishing  more  confidence  in  B.Grimm\u2019s  future  access  to  capital \nmarkets.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  also  ensure  that  B.Grimm  fully  adopts  and  implements  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards standards. \n \nADB\u2019s assistance will help the company establish renewable energy solutions in DMCs \n14. \nwith more challenging legal and regulatory contexts. Countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, and Viet Nam have only recently begun to develop \ndistributed renewable power options such as solar and wind, and new developers face multiple \ntechnical,  legal,  regulatory,  and  financing  challenges.  Through  ADB\u2019s  loan  facility  and \nconcessional  finance,  ADB  will  help  demonstrate  a  track  record  of  successful  financing  to \nencourage private sector developers to take on the higher risk associated with these projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n4\n \n\n \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  (phase  2)  is \n\n15. \nclassified as category B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nB.Grimm was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \n16. \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
