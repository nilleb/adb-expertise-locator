The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Gender-\nFocused Capacity Building in Clean Energy, and if the Board approves the proposed loan and \ngrant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  reliability  of  energy  supply  in  Nepal  and  strengthen  the \ntransmission infrastructure needed to promote Nepal\u2019s capacity for cross-border energy trade. It \nwill  provide  support  in  three  critical  areas  in  the  electricity  supply  industry,  which  has \ntransmission  capacity  expansion, \nexperienced  severe  underinvestment: \n(ii) strengthening  of  distribution  systems  including  those  along  the  Tamakoshi  (Khimti)\u2013\nKathmandu transmission line, and (iii) rehabilitation of selected small hydropower plants.2 \n \n\n(i)  electricity \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  current  available  generating  capacity  of  705  megawatts  (MW)  in  Nepal  comes \n3. \npredominantly  from  hydropower.  At  system  peak  time,  up  to  400  MW  of  load  is  shed 3 \ncountrywide, depending on variations in available water resources and transmission limitations. \nSix hydropower projects totaling 592 MW are presently under construction.  Another six projects \nwith a total capacity of 1,335 MW are planned or proposed in the near to medium term. Limited \ntransmission  capacity  in  western  region  of  Nepal  has  restricted  additional  electricity  imports \nthrough the western border with India. The first large-scale cross-border transmission line with \nIndia between Dhalkebar (Nepal) and Muzarffarpur (India), with a capacity of 1,000 MW, is at an \nadvanced stage of preparation. This will enable Nepal to import electricity from India initially and \nlater  facilitate  hydropower  export.  However,  the  full  benefits  of  this  critical  regional  connection \ncan be harnessed only when adequate strengthening of the related transmission infrastructure \nwithin Nepal is undertaken. \n  \n4. \nA total of 16 Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)-owned small hydropower stations with an \noverall  capacity  of  13.84  MW  are  connected  to  the  national  grid.  Another  23  isolated  power \nplants with a total capacity of 4.54 MW are owned by the NEA; some of them are operated by \nthe  communities.  In  addition,  21  small  hydropower  plants  established  by  the  private  sector \nunder the small power purchase agreements provide 78.5 MW of electricity to the national grid. \nThe  NEA  has  been  implementing  a  plan  to  rehabilitate  aging  small  hydropower  plants  to \nenhance their output. Under the Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement project4, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is assisting the rehabilitation of two such plants. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory  TA. ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Nepal \n\nfor Preparing the Second Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n3  Load  shedding  (also  called  rolling  blackouts)  is  the  practice  of  using  intentionally  engineered  electrical  power \noutages where electricity delivery is stopped for non-overlapping periods over geographical regions. Typically, this \npractice  arises  where  demand  for  electricity  exceeds  the  power  supply  capability  of  the  network  as  a  result  of \ninsufficient  generation  capacity  or  inadequate  transmission  infrastructure  to  deliver  sufficient  power  to  the  area \nwhere it is needed. \n\n4 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Nepal for the \n\nEnergy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  interim  plan  of  Nepal5 sets  out  the  Government  of  Nepal\u2019s  long-term  vision  (up  to \n5. \n2027) for the energy sector. The related targets include (i) developing 4,000 MW of generation \nfor domestic use, (ii) providing electricity to 70% of the population through the national grid and \n25%  through  other  sources,  (iii)  increasing  per  capita  consumption  to  400  kilowatt-hours,  and \n(iv)  exporting  electricity.  Achieving  these  targets  requires  rapid  expansion  of  the  electricity \nsupply  industry.  To  help  attain  the  government\u2019s  objectives  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Nepal,6 ADB continues to focus on (i) improving access to electricity in \nrural  areas,  (ii)  increasing  energy  efficiency,  (iii)  clean  energy  development,  (iv) regional \ncooperation,  (v)  strengthening  sector  governance,  and  (vi)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation. \n \n6. \nIn  2009,  ADB  approved  the  Energy  Access  and  Efficiency  Improvement  Project  to \naddress  immediate  needs  for  improvement  of  electricity  supply  capacity.  Implementation  is \nprogressing as scheduled. The project emphasized a financial restructuring plan for the NEA, its \ninternal restructuring, improved revenue collection, effective tariff regulation, and loss reduction. \nThe  NEA  has  prepared  and  approved  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  which  is  awaiting \ngovernmental  adoption.  During  its  policy  dialogue  with  the  government,  ADB  underscored  the \nneed to implement the FRP, including average upward tariff revisions, to ensure the long-term \nfinancial sustainability of the sector. In line with the release of project funds is conditioned on the \nadoption  of  the  FRP  and  the  announcement  of  a  tariff  rise.  Further,  the  government \nreconstituted  the  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation  Commission 7  as  an  essential  step  toward  the \nproposed  tariff  increases.    Over  the medium term, the  project  design  aims  at  NEA  operational \nsolvency by mid-2015 through multiple measures in the FRP such as reduction of indebtedness, \ntariff  revisions,  and  curtailment  of  interest  on  government  financing  to  NEA.    ADB  will  reserve \nthe right to suspend further disbursements if substantial progress toward this target is not being \nmade.    Under  new  management,  the  NEA  has  instituted  substantial  reform  efforts,  including \ninternal restructuring, demonstrably improved revenue collection, and the development of a loss \nreduction plan, including short-term year-end reduction targets. \n \n7. \nLarge-scale  hydropower  development  is  under  way  in  the  Tamakoshi  Valley,  targeting \nboth  domestic  consumption  and  export  to  India.  The  Tamakoshi\u2013Kathmandu  400-kilovolt  (kV) \nline  under  the  project  will  give  increased  evacuation  capacity  from  the  Tamakoshi  Valley \nthrough  an  alternative  route  to  the  Dhalkebar\u2013Muzaffarpur  cross-border  line  via  Kathmandu. \nThis  transmission  system  configuration  will  accommodate  and  improve  the  reliability  of \nexporting  the  planned  generation.  The  government  is  promoting  the  development  of  small \nhydropower for domestic use, with a standard power purchase tariff provided to the developers. \nThe  government  is  also  encouraging  such  small  hydropower  development  with  people\u2019s \nparticipation  through  village  development  and  district  development  committees.  The  NEA  has \nstarted  a  program  to  provide  electricity  access  to  the  communities  affected  by  greenfield \ntransmission line projects.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  targets  the  strengthening  and  expansion  of  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems,  and  enables  Nepal  to  make  further  use  of  its  abundant  hydropower  resources. \nTransmission network strengthening, in conjunction with current hydropower development, is a \nprecondition  to  reducing  load  shedding  and  technical  losses  and  increased  cross-border \nelectricity trade. The project is designed to address these needs of Nepal\u2019s power system. The \nNEA  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  a  short  list  of  priority  subprojects  for  inclusion  in  the  project. \n\n                                                \n5  Government of Nepal. 2008.

Manila. \n7  The ETFC is an independent body operating under the Electricity Act, 1992 and the Electricity Tariff Fixation Rules, \n\n1993. \n\n \n\n\fThese  subprojects  contribute  to  inclusive  growth  through  increased  income-generating \nopportunities  for  the  poor  with  increased  access  to  electricity,  pro-poor  and  gender  focused \ninterventions,  and  regional  energy  trade.  In  addition,  the  project  supports  improved  project \nmanagement through the training of NEA staff and provision of implementation consultants. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n9. \nThe impact of the project will be increased access to reliable supply of electricity through \nimproved  electricity  supplies  and  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The  outcome  of  the \nproject  will  be  improved  electricity  supply  through  improved  connectivity  between  generation \nand load centers, distribution strengthening, and enhanced small hydropower capacity. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nOutput  A:  Increased  electricity  transmission.  Output  A  will  include  (i)  stringing  a \nsecond  circuit  on  the  132  kV  transmission  line  between  Kohalpur  and  Mahendranagar, \n(ii) construction of the 220 kV or 400 kV Tamakoshi (Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu transmission line and \nrelated facilities, and (iii) expansion of the Chapali grid substation. \n \n11. \nOutput  B:  Expanded  electricity  distribution.

Consequently, the project design envisages \nproviding this required experience through the engagement of an international consulting firm to \nact  as  the  owner\u2019s  engineer  for  output  A.  Additional  demands  on  the  NEA  will  be  due  to  the \nincreases  in  line  lengths,  additional  hardware,  and  resources  to  maintain  transmission  lines \nrated for  400 kV. Where  any  specific  training  on  hardware  items  is required,  the  NEA  has the \ncapacity  to  facilitate  this,  either  through  in-house  training  or  through  manufacturer\u2019s  training \ncommitments, which will be incorporated into hardware supply contracts where necessary. The \nsupply  contracts  will  include  sufficient  spare  parts  plus  quality  and  performance  guarantees.  \nBest  practice  design  standards  and  construction  techniques\u2014including  adaptations  to  counter \nclimate change incidents, e.g., flood and extreme weather\u2014will be applied to all investments \n \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nFinancial  analysis  of  the  project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \n24. \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 13  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2011 prices. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the NEA was evaluated \nto  be  0.75%  per  year.  Project  financial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing  the  financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  WACC.  The  costs  of  the  project  were  evaluated  on  the \nbasis  of  NEA  initial  assessments,  and  were  verified  and  compared  with  industry  norms.  The \ncapital investments, O&M costs, and taxes incurred to install and operate the project were used \nas  costs.  The  benefits  were  evaluated  in  the  following  manner.  For  output  A:  increased \nelectricity  transmission,  the  benefits  are  through  serving  additional  customer  demand,  and \nevacuation  of  hydropower  from  existing  and  new  power  plants.  For  output  B:  expanded \nelectricity  distribution,  the  benefits  arise  through  the  increased  electricity  sales,  which  have \nlargely  reached  the  limits  of  the  existing  distribution  substations  and  lines.  For  output  C: \nenhanced electricity generation, the benefits arise from additional generation from rehabilitation \nof two aging small hydropower plants, which are presently providing only a small portion of their \npotential  electricity  generation.  The  FIRR  of  output  A  is  7.0%  while  that  of  output  B  is  25.0%. \nThe  FIRR  for  part  C  is  6.4%.  These  values  compare  well  with  the  WACC.  The  FIRR  for  the \nentire  project  is  11%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  drops  only  to  6.8%  when \nadverse changes are introduced to all the critical variables. \n \n25. \nEach  project  component  has  been  analyzed  for  economic  viability  using  a  with-  and \nwithout-project  approach.  Without  the  project,  it  is  assumed  that  bottlenecks  will  continue  to \ncause disruption,  and  that  newly  available generation will  not  be  delivered to final consumers. \nWith the project, it is assumed that there will be increased capacity to evacuate newly available \ngeneration  and  to  reduce  system  losses,  resulting  in  increases  in  both  non-incremental  and \nincremental  electricity  consumption.  Economic  evaluation  indicates  that  the  project  will  deliver \nan attractive economic return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the overall project \nis 25.7%. The EIRR is 23.2% for output A while the EIRR is 40.2% for output B and 18.8% for \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

The sensitivity analysis shows that the project returns are robust against changes to \ncritical variables and the project will have a minimum EIRR of 18%. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance  \n\n26. \nThe  government  will  ensure  that  the  NEA  has  operational  autonomy  and  that  no \norganizational  changes  will  affect  its  ability  to  perform  its  obligations  under  the  project.14 A \nfinancial  management  assessment  and  a  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  the  NEA  were \nalso conducted during due diligence. The NEA has defined policies and procedures in place for \naccounting,  budgeting,  and  auditing  activities.  The  NEA  is  required  to  prepare  annual  audited \nfinancial  reports  under  the  NEA  Act  and  in  compliance  with  accounting  requirements  of  the \nCompanies  Act  2007.  The  NEA  has  sufficient  experience  in  local  and  foreign  procurement, \nincluding  ADB  standard  bidding  procedures,under  domestic  projects  and  external  assistance \nfrom  international  development  partners.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  NEA.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nNepal has made considerable progress in reducing poverty. Poverty rates declined in all \nof Nepal\u2019s development regions and ecological belts. More than 80% of the country\u2019s population \nlives  in  rural  areas  where  poverty  is  more  prevalent.  People  who  tend  to  remain  poor  are \nhouseholds  of  agricultural  wage  earners,  those  who  are  landless  or  have  small  land  holdings, \nthose of lower castes, those with illiterate household heads, and those living in large households \nwith more than seven members. The poverty classification of the project is general intervention, \nwith  rural  economic  growth  as  a  theme.  The  project  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  are \nconsistent  with  Nepal\u2019s  tenth  plan  for  poverty  reduction.  Project  interventions  are  designed  to \nbenefit  the  poor  through  increased  economic  opportunity,  knowledge,  and  rights.  The  project \nhas been designed to be classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It includes a gender and \nsocial  inclusion  action  plan  with  integrated  indicators  and  targets  in  the  project  design  and \nmonitoring  framework.  The  gender  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  ensures  that  women  are \nempowered through their participation and representation in a range of project- and nonproject-\nspecific  activities.  Activities  include  partnering with local  electricity  user  cooperatives  in  project \norientation and education awareness, enhancement of livelihoods through skills training, small-\nscale  enterprise  development,  NEA  capacity  building  on  gender  equity,  and  gender-based \ndevelopment  activities  in  the  project  areas.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  with  data \ndisaggregated  by  sex,  caste,  and  ethnicity  will  be  developed  by  the  NEA  and  the  project \nmanagement  unit  to  track  social  inclusive  and  gender-based  achievements  of  the  project. \nFinancing of effective gender mainstreaming activities will be from a combination of Government \nof Nepal counterpart funds and ADB\u2019s TASF-IV, complemented by previously approved Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction grant assistance funds.15  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  environment  category  B  and  the  initial \nenvironment examinations were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \n\n                                                \n14 As part of the NEA financial restructuring plan, the NEA has proposed for government approval the establishment \nof  a  rural  electrification  entity,  and  will  undertake  to  keep  ADB  informed  of  any  effect  this  could  have  on  (i)  the \nownership and management of assets of the NEA, which are involved in the project; and (ii) the implementation of \nthe project and obligations of the NEA as executing agency. \n\n15  ADB. 2010.

Public  consultation  and  information  disclosure  requirements  have  been  met. \nAlignment  of  transmission  lines  has  avoided  any  environmentally  and  ecologically  sensitive \nareas. Out of the total length of the Tamakoshi (Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu line, 16 kilometers will pass \nthrough  some  forest  areas  in  Chanrawati  Watershed16,  which  is  host  to  ecosystem  services \ntransaction17 but  is  not  a  legally  protected  area.  Any  loss  of  vegetation  within  the  right-of-way \nwill  be  directly  offset  by  reforestation  activities  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the \ngovernment.  The  NEA  and  ADB  will  provide  oversight  to  ensure  that  ongoing  reforestation \ninitiatives within the Chanrawati Watershed will not be affected. Installation of the second circuit \nfor  the Kohalpur\u2013Mahendranagar  line  will  not  have  any  significant  impacts  as  no  new \ntransmission  towers  will  be  required  and  the  existing  right-of-way  will  be  maintained. \nDecommissioned equipment and materials from the rehabilitation of distribution substations and \nthe small hydropower plants are not expected to cause any risk to community health and safety \nas  these  will  be  stored  on  site  until  they  can  be  safely  reused  and  redistributed  to  other \nsubstations.  Disposal  of  unusable  equipment  will  comply  with  national  and  international \nrequirements such as the Stockholm Convention.18 \n \n29. \nThe  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  includes  mitigation  measures,  monitoring, \nand adequate budgetary provisions for its implementation. The EMP will be part of the bidding \ndocuments  and  the  NEA  will  supervise  the  construction  contracts  and  EMP  implementation. \nMonitoring reports will be submitted semiannually by the NEA to ADB. EMPs will be updated if \nunanticipated  impacts  are identified  during  implementation. The  NEA has  sufficient capacity  in \nits  Environmental  and  Social  Studies  Department  to  implement  the  EMP.  Third-party  services \nwill be utilized for monitoring and mitigation activities as necessary. \n \n30. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The project will \nhave  limited  resettlement  impacts  and  no  adverse  impacts  on  indigenous  groups. 19  An \nestimated 39 households, with about 195 people, will lose an estimated 15 hectares of land as a \nresult  of  the  construction  of  three  new  substations  (Laipur,  Kohalpur,  and  Moolpani)  and  the \nupgrading of one existing substation (Barhabise). No landowner or household will lose 10% or \nmore  of  their  productive  assets.  People  using  or  living  along  the  transmission  line  will  be \ntemporarily  impacted  and  restricted  to  using  affected  land  for  agricultural  purposes.  Affected \npersons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. No further clearance or acquisition of land will be required for the project. \n \nThe  NEA  is  considered  to  have  adequate  institutional  capacity  to  implement,  manage, \n31. \nand  monitor  all  activities.  In  contributing  to  poverty  reduction  and  alleviation,  the  NEA  and \ncontractors will ensure that 30% of the workforce originates from the local area and that priority \nand  preference  is  given  to  women,  the  poor,  and  marginalized  ethnic  groups.  The  project  will \npromote  and  advocate  for  a  socially  inclusive,  gender  equitable,  and  nondiscriminatory  work \n\n                                                \n16 The watershed area was declared in 2010 after the licensing in 2007 of the Tamakoshi hydropower facilities within \nits  boundaries;  it  was  acknowledged  that  hydropower  development  would  occur  in  this  area  which  does  not \nconstitute a critical habitat.  \n\n17 Payments  to  land  managers  and  others  to  undertake  actions  that  increase  the  quantity  and  quality  of  benefits \n\npeople gain from ecosystems such as food and water and regulation of floods, drought and land degradation. \n\n18 United  Nations  Environment  Programme..  2004.  Stockholm  Convention  on  Persistent  Organic  Pollutants. \n\nStockholm. \n\n19 No  impacts  are  foreseen  on  indigenous  peoples  groups.  If  impacts  are  identified,  the  NEA  will  be  required  to \nprepare an indigenous peoples plan identifying fair and inclusive compensation and rehabilitation measures, in line \nwith  host  country  laws,  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement requirements. \n\n\fenvironment and practices. Practices will be consistent with core labor standards, which among \nother  things,  prohibit  the  use  of  child  laborers,  forced,  bonded,  or  compulsory  labor  practices; \nand  seek  to  ensure  fair  treatment,  good  working  conditions,  and  safe  working  practices  for  all \nworkers.  Where  worker  migration  is  required,  the  project  will  minimize  the  risk  of  HIV/AIDS \nthrough information dissemination at project areas. Social safeguards shall be achieved in line \nwith the provisions stated in the PAM.20 \n \n32. \nA detailed resettlement plan will guide the resettlement process and describe the nature \nof  impacts,  range  of  and  eligibility  for  entitlements,  income  and  livelihood  restoration, \nrehabilitation  assistance,  and  compensation  for  losses  incurred.  The  resettlement  plan  details \nthe institutional arrangements for implementation, a procedure for grievance redress, a structure \nfor periodic and regular monitoring and reporting of project activities, detailed cost and budget \nestimates, and a time-bound implementation schedule. The resettlement plan will be updated as \nneeded  and  publicly  disclosed  to  interested  stakeholders  on  the  ADB  and  NEA  websites. \nProject-affected  peoples  will  be  consulted  on  a  regular  basis  as  needed,  in  a  timely,  open, \ntransparent, and culturally sensitive manner and in the local language. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nThe  project  does  not  have  unusual  technical  risks.  Each  subproject  will  use  standard \ntechnologies  used  in  Nepal  and  will  be  designed  and  selected  according  to  international \nstandards. The risk of weak technical supervision capacity of the NEA will be addressed by the \nuse of a specialist firm to perform the role of owner\u2019s engineer for the 400 kV rated Tamakoshi \n(Khimti)\u2013Kathmandu line and related transmission substations, which will be at a higher voltage \nthan other existing lines in Nepal.
