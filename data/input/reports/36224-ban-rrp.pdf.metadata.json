The 23 \ndistricts  are  (i)  in  Rajshahi  Division:  Dinajpur,  Thakurgaon,  Panchagar, \nRangpur,  Nilphamari,  Gaibandha,  Kurigram,  and  Lalmonirhat;  (ii)  in \nDhaka  Division:  Mymensingh,  Kishoreganj,  Netrokona,  Jamalpur, \nSherpur, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, Narsingdi, Manikganj, Munshiganj, and \nNarayanganj; and (iii) in Chittagong Division: Comilla, Brahmanbaria, and \nChandpur. Poverty reduction will be realized by expanding the economic \nopportunities of the rural poor by improving rural infrastructure (roads and \ngrowth center markets [GCMs]), gender development, and improved local \ngovernance.  Poverty  reduction  will  be  achieved  by  targeting  poor  areas, \nclosely  involving  the  poor  and  other  stakeholders  in  implementing \nsubprojects  and  maintaining  rural  infrastructure,  and  strengthening  the \ncapability of local institutions. \n \nEfficient  rural  transport  and  supporting  infrastructure  are  indispensable \nto  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  rapid  economic  development  in \nBangladesh. Investments in rural infrastructure have been made by the \nGovernment with substantial assistance from external funding agencies \nincluding  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project  draws  on \nexperience and lessons identified from previous projects, particularly in \nmainstreaming \nlocal \ngovernment.  The  Project  area  consists  of  23  districts  in  Rajshahi, \nDhaka,  and  Chittagong  divisions  that  were  selected  for  their  poverty, \npoorly  developed  road  infrastructure,  and  need  for  strengthened  local \ngovernance.  Improving  rural  roads  and  associated  infrastructure  will \nprovide  local  inhabitants  with  efficient  transport  to  markets  and  trading \ncenters and access to social and welfare services. These improvements \nwill  lay  the  foundation  for  better  economic  opportunities  and  assist  in \nreducing poverty. Strengthening local government units will enable them \nto  plan,  manage,  and  maintain  the  local  infrastructure.  Stakeholders \nfrom  the  private  sector\u2014such  as  bus  owners  and  operators,  rickshaw \ndrivers,  farmers,  and  local  traders\u2014will  be  consulted  on  their  transport \nneeds.  Local  participation  will  create  a  sense  of  ownership  and  focus \ngreater attention to effective maintenance. \n\nthe  participatory  approach  and  empowering \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject \nDescription \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nProject \nInvestment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgency \n\n \n\nthe  capability  of \n\ninfrastructure  will  provide \n\nThe  Project  will  upgrade  about  1,360  kilometers  (km)  of  subdistrict \nroads,  780  km  of  union  roads,  7,780  km  of  village  roads,  370  rural \nmarkets,  and  190  union  council  complexes.  It  will  also  provide  for \nlocal  government  units.  These \nstrengthening \nlocal \ncomplementary  elements  of  rural \ncommunities  with  effective  transport  to  markets  and  access  to  social \nservices.  Investments  in  the  Project  will  effectively  reduce  poverty  by \nabout 7%, as small farmers and the functionally landless will gain from \nadditional  employment,  particularly  of  women.  Additional  employment \nwill  mean  increased  household  income.  The  improved  rural  road \nnetwork  will  bring  increased  motorized  and  other  transport  services, \nlower  transport  costs  for  goods  and  passengers,  allow  substantial \nsavings  in  vehicle  operating  costs,  and  catalyze  an  overall  increase  in \ntraffic  volume  by  about  70%.  The  Project  will  improve  the  environment \nby  planting  and  maintaining  trees  along  the  roads  and  building  more \neffective drainage infrastructure.  \n  \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $260.5  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $20.1 million. \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nA.

A  full-time  project  director  will  head  the  PMO \nand be responsible for overall project implementation and coordination, \nreporting  to  the  chief  engineer  of  LGED.  The  PMO  will  establish  three \nregional  offices\u2014one  each  in  LGED\u2019s    district    offices    in    Dhaka,  \nRangpur,  and  Mymensingh\u2014each headed by a deputy project director. \nThe  deputy  project  directors  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation  and  supervision  of  project  activities  in  their  respective \nregions. The office of the deputy project director for Dhaka Division will \nbe  based  at  the  PMO.  A  project  steering  committee,  established  under \nthe  first  Rural  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  and  comprising  the \nline agencies concerned, local government bodies, and nongovernment \nand  private  sector  representatives,  will  provide  overall  policy  guidance \nfor project implementation. \n \nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  All  civil  works  will  be  procured  from  among  qualified  local \ncontractors  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  prescribed \nby  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulation  (2003)  and \nacceptable to ADB. Civil works for improving infrastructure will comprise \nmany  small  contracts  scattered  over  a  large  area.  The  procurement  of \nequipment,  including  vehicles,  will  be  by  international  competitive \nbidding  for  contracts  above  $500,000,  limited  international  bidding  for \ncontracts  between  $300,000  and  $500,000,  and  national  competitive \nbidding for contracts below $300,000. \n \nConsultants will assist LGED in project implementation. Three groups of \nin  (i)  project  design, \nconsulting  services  are  required \nsupervision, and monitoring, (ii) institutional strengthening and training of \nlocal  government  institutions,  and  (iii)  improving  LGED  capacity. \nConsultants under (i) and (ii) will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Consultants  under  (iii)  financed \nby GTZ will be recruited according to its own procedures.  \n \nThe  directly  quantifiable  benefits  of  the  Project  consist  of  savings  in \nvehicle operating costs on the improved subdistrict and union roads. The \nbeneficiaries  are  various  road  users:  bus  and  truck  owners  and \noperators, passengers, cargo movers, and the general population in the \narea of influence, estimated at about 6 million people, 50% of whom live \nbelow the poverty line. Improvements in growth center markets (GCMs) \nwill  enable  more  efficient  trading.  About  52,800  person-years  of \nemployment  will  be  generated  during \nthe  construction  period. \nPermanent  employment  of  women  (about  7,000  new  jobs)  will  be \ngenerated  by  retail  areas  in  GCMs,  the  maintenance  of  completed \nroads, and the maintenance of trees planted along subdistrict and union \nroads.  \n \n\nto  assist \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n \n \n\n \n\nThe Project\u2019s overall economic rate of return is quite robust at 36% for \nsubdistrict roads, with individual subprojects\u2019 EIRR ranging from 12% to \nover 50%. The Project will reduce poverty by (i) enabling poor people to \nparticipate in economic activities and gain access to social services and \n(ii)  creating  additional  employment  opportunities  by  stimulating \neconomic  growth.  Beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  the  general \npopulation  in  the  23  districts,  who will  experience  shorter travel  time  at \nreduced  cost,  as  well  as  transport  operators,  traders,  and  consumers \nwho  directly  use  the  goods  and  services  transported  in  and  out  of  the \narea. \n \nThe  Project  has  been  carefully  prepared  to  mitigate  risks.  To  avoid \ndelays  in  start-up,  advance  action  for  recruiting  consultants  has  been \ntaken. The preparation of the Government development project proposal \nwas  advanced  for  the  same  reason.  Risks  from  the  use  of  local \ncontractors  will  be  mitigated  through  actions  taken  in  earlier  projects, \nsuch  as  training  them  on  construction  quality  control.  Participatory \nprocesses  involving  stakeholders  at  all  levels  will  foster  a  sense  of \nownership  and  minimize  delays  caused  by  lack  of  involvement  in \ndecision-making.  Environmental  and  social  processes,  including  a \nresettlement framework formulated for the Project, will address issues of \nlocal  sensitivity  and  minimize  adverse  effects.  Careful  attention  to \nmonitoring  mechanisms  during  implementation  will  ensure  that  gender \nconsiderations  and  measures  to  prevent  child  labor  are  properly \nimplemented during construction.  \n\n

(ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a grant to be \nprovided  by  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  through  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) to the Government of Bangladesh (the Government) for the Second Rural \nInfrastructure Improvement Project (the Project).1 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe economic development strategy of Bangladesh is closely linked to the improvement \nof  existing  rural  infrastructure.  Efforts  in  this  regard  were  initially  taken  in  1984  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s formulation of its National Strategy for Rural Development. The strategy focused \non  channeling  financial  resources  toward  developing  1,400  \u201cgrowth  centers\u201d  where  physical \ninfrastructure  such  as  roads,  markets,  and  storage  facilities  would  be  developed  as  a  major \nelement  of  rural  development.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  of  the  Government  have \nsupported  the  strategy  since  its  formulation  and  have  made  substantial  investments  in  rural \ninfrastructure  development  through  the  years.  Appendix  2  presents  the  externally  funded \nprojects in rural infrastructure. Improving rural infrastructure has also been a key element in the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty. The national poverty reduction strategy2 (NPRS) aims \nto \u201creduce poverty within the shortest possible time so as to gradually lift the vast majority of the \npeople above the poverty line and improve their quality of life.\u201d More specifically, the country\u2019s \nMillennium Development Goal is to reduce poverty incidence in Bangladesh by half (to 25%) by \nthe year 2015. ADB\u2019s lending program to Bangladesh3 recognizes this linkage as it identifies the \nmajor causes of poverty in Bangladesh as \u201cliving in remote and unfavorable environments with \nlimited  transport  and  other  infrastructure.\u201d  The  Project  addresses  the  problem  of  isolation-\ninduced  poverty  by  expanding  the  economic  opportunities  available  to  the  rural  poor  through \nimproved rural infrastructure. \n \n3. \nThe  road  transport  system  of  Bangladesh  is  an  extensive  network  with  a  total  length  of \n272,208 kilometers (km). The primary road network connecting the major cities to the 64 districts \nof  the  country  is  8,555  km  long,  while  the  secondary  road  network\u2014i.e.,  district  roads  (formerly \nknown  as  feeder  road  type  A,  or  FRA)  connecting  the  subdistricts4  to  the  national  and  regional \ngrid\u2014is  13,823  km  long.  The  Roads  and  Highways  Department,  under  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, administers the national and the regional grid together with district roads. The \nLocal  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment,  and  Cooperatives  (MLGRDC)  is  responsible  for  tertiary  roads  (the  rural  road \nnetwork),  namely  the  36,166  km  of  subdistrict  roads  (formerly  known  as  feeder  road  type  B  or \nFRB), 42,329 km of union5 roads (formerly called rural road, type 1 or RR1) and, together with the \nunion councils (UCs), the 171,335 km of village roads (formerly rural road types 2 and 3 or RR2 \nand  RR3).  Of  the  36,116  km  of  subdistrict  roads,  about  50%  are  paved,  leaving  18,277  km  in \nneed of improvement. The need is even greater for union roads, of which only 20% (or 8,513 km) \nof the total are paved. The scope for investment in rural road development is quite substantial.  \n\n                                                 \n1  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  provided  under  ADB.  2005.

Manila.  \n4   Subdistricts (upazila) are local government units at the third level of administration below divisions and districts. \n5   Unions are the next level of government below the subdistricts. A union typically covers about 30 square kilometers \n\nand has a population of about 27,000. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe volume of traffic in the country has been growing at about 7.3% a year, faster than the \n4. \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) of about 5.5%. Both freight and passenger traffic have \nshifted significantly from rail and water transport systems. From 1975 to 1997, the percentage of \nfreight  transported  over  roads  increased  from  35%  to  63%,  while  that  of  passenger  traffic \nincreased  from  54%  to  73%.  Improved  roads  provide  more  comfortable  travel,  lower  transport \ncosts, and significant savings in vehicle operating costs for all vehicles. With further upgrading of \nthe country\u2019s road network, the demand for road transport will continue to rise. \n \nFunds for maintaining rural roads have been provided by the Government to LGED on a \n5. \nsustained basis since LGED assumed this responsibility in 1993. The Government\u2019s allocation \nfor  this  purpose  has  increased  from  Tk300  million  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  1993  to  Tk4.0  billion  in \nFY2006. Apart from these direct allocations, LGED also receive direct assistance from external \nfunding agencies, including ADB. For instance, in recently concluded FY2005, the total amount \nallocated by the Government for maintenance amounted to Tk4.8 billion, of which Tk1.1 billion \nwas  contributed  by  external  funding  agencies.  Taking  account  of  funds  from  various  sources, \nthe  allocation  for  maintenance  invariably  falls  below  the  annual  requirements.  The  gap \n(averaging about 10\u201315% in recent years) is likely to widen as more roads are improved. The \nRural  Roads  Master  Plan  (July  2005)  indicates  that  by  2015  no  new  improvements  on \nsubdistrict roads will be pursued and that, thereafter, as the need for maintenance rises rapidly, \nfunds  for  development  will  be  shifted  to  maintenance.  The  estimated  funding  requirement  for \nrural road maintenance from FY2016 to FY2020, when no new road improvement is envisaged, \nis  Tk104.7 billion,  or  about  Tk21  billion a  year.  An  analysis  of  the  rural  infrastructure  sector is \nsummarized in Appendix 1. \n  \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nThe  NPRS  has  provided  the  needed  direction  to  guide  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners  in  developing  rural  infrastructure  through  the  years.  Investments  in  the \nsector have been shown to result in higher farm productivity and income, particularly among the \nrural poor and women. The strategy has proven to be particularly effective in reducing poverty \nnationwide. The percentage of the population below the poverty line fell from 58.8% in 1991 to \n49.8% in 2000, or a decline of about 1% per year. A recent poverty monitoring report indicated a \nfurther decline of 5% over the 5-year period ending in 2004.  \n \n7. \nThe  NPRS  has  been  implemented  through  a  series  of  rural  infrastructure  development \nprojects  (RIDP-1,  RIDP-2,  and  RIDP-3)  and  a  rural  infrastructure  improvement  project  (RIIP-I) \nassisted  by  the  ADB.6  The  Project  completion  reports  for  the  RIDPs  showed  that  the  projects \ncontributed significantly to the strategy, particularly by generating employment for the rural poor \nthrough  labor-intensive  constructions.  The  lessons  learned  from  previous  projects  favor  (i) \nemphasizing  the  pro-poor  bias  in  the  selection  of  areas  to  be  covered  under  the  Project;  (ii) \nputting  greater  emphasis  on  stakeholders\u2019  participation  in  project  design  and  implementation; \n(iii)  strengthening  local  government  capacity  to  manage  and  maintain  rural  infrastructure;  (iv) \ncontinuing  the  hiring  of  local  contracting  societies  for  maintenance  to  provide  employment  for \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB.  1988.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ndestitute rural women; (v) continuing the use and training of local contractors who provide cost-\neffective,  labor-intensive  skills;  and  (vi)  the  institutional  strengthening  of  LGED,  particularly  in \nthe  areas  of  participatory  development,  contract  management,  and  financial  management. \nLessons learned from previous projects in the sector are summarized in Appendix 8. \n \n8. \nLGED\u2019s  organizational  structure  has  been  undergoing  changes  to  accommodate  its \nexpanding  responsibilities  for  assisting  the  development  of  the  country\u2019s  rural  infrastructure. \nRecent efforts to enhance its capability for planning, managing, and implementing projects were \ntaken  under  an  ADB-funded  technical  assistance  study  completed  in  1998.7  The  study \nconcluded that LGED\u2019s responsibilities have expanded more quickly than the capabilities of its \nstaff and that LGED should focus on consolidating and improving its internal efficiency. While a \nnumber of new staff have been recruited by LGED, including two additional chief engineers and \nsix  new  executive  engineers,  the  number  of  vacant  posts  remains  at  about  10%  of  total \napproved posts. Among the major recommendations of the technical assistance study are that \n(i) LGED develop a scientific organizational structure and install proper management systems at \nall  levels  and  (ii)  LGED  upgrade  its  financial  management  system  and  fully  implement  the \nstandard  system  of  accounts.  Implementation  of  these  recommendations  is  being  carried  out \nthrough  a  number  foreign-assisted  projects8  and  will  continue  under  the  Project.  In  addition, \nLGED  staff  have  been  undergoing  training  in  participatory  approaches,  project  planning  and \nmanagement, and social analysis.  \n \n9. \nTo reach a greater proportion of the population who would benefit from its development \nefforts, the Government has devolved to local government units responsibility for planning and \nexecuting various investment projects. In rural Bangladesh, the UC has been identified as the \nfocal point for infrastructure development, in addition to its major responsibilities for maintaining \npeace  and  order  and  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  health  and  family-planning  programs. \nUCs  receive  allocations  from  the  Government\u2019s  annual  development  programs  and  are  also \nempowered to raise revenues locally to meet part of their financial needs. Assistance given in \nthe  past  has  generally  been  meager;  as  a  result,  the  UCs  remain  weak  organizationally  and \nfinancially.  They  also  lack  the  technical  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  projects  effectively.  A \ncontinuing need is to strengthen the UCs and prepare them to assume greater responsibility for \ngovernance  and  to  make  them  effective  channels  for  delivering  services  from  the  central \nGovernment. Strengthening measures and project funds will be provided to the UCs under the \nProject to address this problem. \n \n10. \nIn its continuing efforts to pursue the NPRS, the Government added another 700 growth \ncenters in 1994 to the 1,400 identified earlier, in which rural investments are to be concentrated. \nThe  growth  centers  were  selected  based  on  the  size  of  population  and  area  served  and  their \nrevenue  potential,  trading  volume,  and  distance  from  neighboring  growth  centers.  They  are \ntherefore the locations for trade and commercial activities, so improving the facilities of growth \ncenter markets (GCMs) is seen as the key element of the country\u2019s rural development strategy. \nPursuit  of  the  strategy  has  proven  effective  in  rationally  distributing  public  investments. \nHowever, the need remains to introduce tighter regulations and encourage greater transparency \nin the management and operation of GCMs. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1998.

Manila. \n\n8    An  institutional  strengthening  action  plan  that  seeks  to  enhance  LGED  capabilities  in  planning,  monitoring,  and \nasset  management  is  supported  under  IDA.  2003.  Project  Appraisal  Document  on  a  Proposed  Credit  to  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Rural Transport Improvement Project. Washington DC (Report No. 25853-\nBD). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImproving rural infrastructure like roads, markets, jetties, and the physical facilities of the \n11. \nUCs  can  contribute  to  reducing  poverty.  Improved  roads  and  markets  lower  vehicle  operating \ncosts  and  marketing  costs  while  facilitating  access  to  such  public  services  as  healthcare, \neducation,  and  agricultural  extension.  A  study  carried  out  in  19949  showed  that,  in  the \ncatchment area of improved facilities, transport charges dropped by 19% for cargo and 23% for \npassengers, while the volume traded in the improved markets increased by 100%. Substantial \ngrowth  was  achieved  in  motorized  and  other  traffic,  which  increased  by  135%  and  85%, \nrespectively, after the roads were widened and paved. \n \n12. \nIn preparing the Project, stakeholder workshops were held at the union and the division \nlevels.  The  workshops  confirmed  the  high  expectations  among  local  communities  about  the \nbenefits  from  improved  rural  infrastructure.  The  workshops  also  helped  to  identify  issues  that \nbear on the construction of specific works under the Project. The issues included the need for (i) \nmainstreaming  the  participatory  approach  and  improving  local  government  units,  (ii)  providing \nUCs with a sustainable source of revenue to finance their activities and services, (iii) improving \ntransparency and strict enforcement of existing procedures in the operation of rural markets, (iv) \nspecifying the roles of the local institutions in the sustained maintenance of completed facilities, \nand (v) improving the safety of rural roads. The lessons learned at these workshops have been \nincorporated in the design of the Project.    \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe Project impact will be to help reduce poverty by about 7% in the rural communities of \n23  districts  in  north  and  central  Bangladesh.  The  impact  will  be  realized  through  (i)  enhanced \naccess for the rural communities to basic services, (ii) increased on-farm income from the greater \navailability  of  agriculture  inputs  such  as  fertilizer  and  high-yielding  seed  varieties,  (iii)  enhanced \nwomen empowerment through improved access to social services and higher family income, and \n(iv) improved local governance. The project area, totaling 47,152 square kilometers (km2), has a \npopulation of 55.9 million, accounting for 45% of the country\u2019s total population. The project area \nwas chosen because of its extensive poverty and low level of development. In the three divisions \nof  Rajshahi,  Dhaka,  and  Chittagong  where  the  23  districts  are  located,  about  55%  of  rural \nresidents  live  below  the  poverty  line,  a  percentage  higher  than  the  national  average  of  nearly \n50%.  Of  the  existing  subdistrict  roads,  only  30%  are  in  good  condition,  and  of  the  806  GCMs, \nabout 50% need to be improved. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \n14.  More than 6 million people will gain all-weather access to GCMs and social services at \nUC offices. The direct impact of providing these physical facilities and strengthening institutions \nwill be (i) an estimated reduction in poverty in the project area by about 7%, (ii) an increase in \nthe  average  farm  family  income  by  about  20%,  (iii)  an  additional  52,800  person-years  of \nunskilled employment during construction, and (iv) the employment of about 7,000 women in the \nnew GCMs, tree planting and care, and infrastructure maintenance.  \n \nB. \n \n15. \n\nThe Project will include the following components:  \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n9  KfW. 1994. Socioeconomic Impact of Tangail Infrastructure Development Project. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\n \n\n1.  \n\nImproved Rural Roads \n\na. \n\nSubdistrict and Union Roads \n\n16. \nThe  Project  will  upgrade  1,360  km  of  subdistrict  roads  and  780  km  of  union  roads  to \nbitumen-surfaced  standard  and  to  provide  year-round  connectivity  between  agricultural \nproduction areas and GCMs. The Project will add about 7.6% to the current stock of improved \nsubdistrict roads (17,889 km) and 6.4% to the existing improved union roads (8,513 km). Each \nroad was selected through a participatory process with stakeholders. Structures such as bridges \nand culverts with a total length of 5,470 meters will be provided. Provisions for road safety such \nas road signs and loading and unloading zones will be incorporated into the design of subdistrict \nroads.  Women  belonging  to  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs)10  will  be  engaged  to  improve \nroad shoulders, plant trees on roadsides, and maintain roads. \n \n \n \n17. \nThe Project will provide for resectioning 7,780 km of village roads with earthworks to link \nthe villages more closely with markets and other vital services. The roads will be selected through \nparticipatory  development.  Each  UC  will  be  asked  to  prepare  a  proposal  to  the  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  to  improve  village  roads  in  its  jurisdiction.  The  PMO  will  review  the \nproposals and, if warranted, grant them approval. Each road will connect the selected villages with \na higher-order road or GCM. Suitable structures such as bridges and culverts will be provided to \nclose any existing gap on the road. The UC will be responsible for maintaining village roads. \n \n   \n\nSubmersible Roads \n\nVillage Roads \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\n \n\n18.  A  total  of  60  km  of  submersible  roads  will  be  improved  in  areas  that  are  rendered \ninaccessible  due  to  total  submergence  6  months  a  year,  i.e.,  in  the  haor11  areas.  While \ntransport  needs  in  these  areas  are  met  by  boats  during  the  wet  monsoon,  boat  services  are \ngreatly reduced during the dry season, isolating large populated areas. The submersible roads \nwill  facilitate  dry  season  transport  and  communications  and  open  up  the  haor  areas  to  the \ndelivery  of  economic  and  social  services.  The  submersible  roads  will  have  a  rigid  surface  to \nbetter  withstand  prolonged  submergence.  The  district  office  of  LGED  will  be  responsible  for \nmaintaining submersible roads. \n\nd. \n\nRoad Safety Improvements \n\n19. \nThe Project will improve the safety provisions for roads constructed under the Project, as \nwell as roads built under previous projects that do not have such features but require them now \ndue  to  higher  traffic  volume.  Adequate  road  signs,  markings,  safety  barriers,  and  loading  and \nunloading zones near schools and markets will be built to make the roads safe. Safety manuals \nand posters will be printed, and awareness campaigns mounted, to further enhance road safety. \n\n2. \n\nImproved Rural Infrastructure \n\n \n\na. \n\nGrowth Center Markets \n\n   \n \nA total of 370 markets will be improved under the Project, including (i) 52 GCMs located \n20. \nat subdistrict headquarters, (ii) 130 GCMs located in other subdistrict areas, and (iii) 188 major \nvillage markets. Each GCM will be connected either to an existing paved road or to one of those \n                                                 \n10  LCSs  comprise  poor  women  with  limited  income-earning  capabilities  who  carry  out  routine  maintenance  on  rural \n\nroads using basic hand tools and materials supplied by LGED. \n\n11 Haors are wetland basin depressions that get flooded during the monsoon season to as much as 6 meters above \nthe dry season water level. The haors perform an important ecological function, acting as natural water reservoirs.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nto be improved under the Project. Each GCM will be provided with paved trading areas, sheds, \na water supply system, adequate drainage facilities, sanitation facilities, and market offices. At \neach  GCM,  a  market  management  committee  will  be  responsible  for ensuring  proper  physical \nand  financial  maintenance.  Each  village  market  will  be  provided  with  an  access  road,  paved \nselling areas, sheds, and sanitary facilities.  \n \n21.  While the project GCMs designs call for each to include an average 12 shops for women \nvenders, the existing GCMs had been built exclusively for men. Accordingly, based on demand \nshown  during  participatory  discussions,  additional  shops  will  be  constructed  to  accommodate \nwomen  traders.  Each  shop  will  measure  about  6  square  meters,  have  a  roll-up  door,  and  be \nconstructed in line with LGED\u2019s gender-sensitive design standard for these facilities. The added \nfacilities will provide more economic opportunities for women to contribute to the family income \nand to enhance their empowerment.  \n \n\nb. \n\nUnion Council Complexes  \n\n \nTo  enhance  the  effective  delivery  of  public  services,  the  offices  and  facilities  of  union \n22. \ncouncil complexes (UCCs) in 190 locations will be improved. The improved facilities will serve \nas  a  one-stop  center  to  provide  the  local  population  with  ready  access  to social and  technical \nservices for healthcare, education, agricultural and livestock extension, and land administration \nat  the  union  level.  Needed  office  furniture  and  equipment  will  also  be  provided  to  the  UCCs. \nRoads to the UCCs will be improved to permit year-round access. The UC will be responsible \nfor maintaining UCCs using their own funds. \n\nc. \n\nJetties  \n\n \n \n23. \nTo  complement  the  connectivity  afforded  by  rural  roads  and  integrate  land  transport \nservices with water transport, 25 jetties will be improved in areas selected through participatory \nconsultation  based  on  agreed  selection  criteria  such  as  their  proximity  to  GCMs  and  the \navailability of land. Jetty improvement will involve installing mooring facilities at a cleared area of \nthe  riverbank  near  the  main  loading  and  unloading  zone,  where  boats  can  be  securely  tied. \nJetties will be linked to a paved road and located in the immediate vicinity of a GCM. Necessary \nsanitary  facilities  will  be  provided  at  each  jetty  site.  A  jetty  management  committee  will  be \nresponsible for its day-to-day operation and maintenance.  \n\n \nd.  \n \n\nFlood Refuge Shelters \n\nTo  provide  emergency  relief  for  victims  of  floods,  six  flood  refuge  shelters  will  be \n24. \nconstructed. Each shelter will provide accommodation for people and have a separate section \nfor  livestock.  A  typical  shelter  will  have  an  area  of  150  square  meters,  including  sanitary \nfacilities. Each shelter will be designed as a multipurpose building and located close to the UCC \nto maximize its use year-round. \n\nImproved Local Governance and LGED Capacity \n\na. \n \n\nLocal Governance \n\n25. \nTo  enhance  the  capability  of  local  government  units  to  plan  and  implement  rural \ninfrastructure  works,  the  Project  will  implement  various  training  programs  and  awareness \ncampaigns for members and officers of 1,832 UCs, local women leaders, and members of the \nmanagement committees of GCMs and jetties. Training program topics will include the roles and \nresponsibilities  of  the  UC,  financial  management,  poor  people\u2019s  participation  in  local  decision \nmaking,  and  participatory  planning.  The  training  programs  will  be  supplemented  by  on-the-job \n\n \n \n\n \n3.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ntraining and awareness campaigns using posters, comic books, and short radio and television \nprograms  focusing  on  issues  including  governance  (transparency,  accountability,  and  efficient \nadministration), health, and sanitation. Selected young people, both male and female, will also \nreceive  skills  training  on  livelihood  projects.  Project  consultants  will  assist  in  packaging  the \ntraining programs and implementing the awareness campaigns. \n\n \n\n26. \nResource  mobilization  by  the  unions  will  be  enhanced  by  full  implementation  of  an \nexisting  Government  regulation  assigning  the  collection  of  specific  taxes  to  UCs,  including \nassessments on homes and residential lots, taxes on professionals and owners of businesses, \nfees  for  birth  and  death  certificates,  and  many  others.  To  help  UCs  properly  maintain  various \nrecords and accounts, as well as manage its resource mobilization efforts, the Government will \nappoint, by 31 December 2008, an accountant at each union. In line with the newly established \nregulations  governing  the  management  of  GCMs,  members  of  UCs  (including  women)  will  be \nappointed as members of market management committees (MMCs). Guidelines on MMCs are \nbeing  revised  to  regulate  the  award  and  management  of  new  leases  and  provide  for  a  higher \nshare of the income from market leases to UCs. \n \n\nb. \n\nLGED Capacity Building \n\n \nThe Project will provide training to LGED staff both locally and overseas. Local training12 \n27. \nwill be given in contract management, financial management, participatory methods, construction \nsupervision and quality control, the application of information technology in project design, gender \nand development, and monitoring and evaluation. Overseas training  will be given to LGED staff \nselected  through  transparent  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  areas  of  training  will  include \nsafe road design, rural road technology, field and laboratory tests for road engineers, and project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  LGED  will  further  strengthen  its  procurement  unit  by  recruiting  four \nadditional  engineers  and  five  additional  support  staff.  The  Project  will  include  an  internship \nprogram  whereby  senior  engineering  students  gain  practical  work  experience  in  LGED  to \ncomplement their formal education. In addition, the physical facilities of LGED in four regions will \nbe improved by constructing new offices-cum-housing compounds for the regional superintending \nengineers and staff. Dilapidated furniture in subdistrict engineers\u2019 offices will be replaced. Project \nconsultants  will  provide  on-the-job  training  to  LGED  staff  in  road  safety,  road  maintenance \nplanning, social assessments, gender development, and impact monitoring.  \n\n \n\n4.  \n\nSupport for Project Management  \n\n \n28. \nTo ensure the efficient implementation and management of project activities, incremental \nstaff will be provided to districts and subdistricts together with needed logistics. A combination of \ninternational  and  national  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  to  support  project  design, \nsupervision, management, and capacity building. A series of socioeconomic studies that focus \non evaluating the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction and its strengthening of the capacity of \nUCs will be carried out to assist LGED in managing the Project. A benchmark study will be carried \nout at the start of the Project, followed by study on the third year and the final study at the end of \nproject implementation. LGED will undertake an evaluation study 5 years after project completion. \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  local  governance  by  providing  additional  staff  to  UCs  and \ntraining  to  local  officials,  and  by  mounting  wide-ranging  awareness  campaigns  directed  at  the \n\nSpecial Features \n\n                                                 \n12    This  part  of  capacity  building  will  be  implemented  and  financed  in  parallel  by  the  German  Development \n\nCooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nrural  population.  The  capacity  of  UCs  to  plan  and  execute  local  projects  through  the \nparticipatory  approach  will  be  sharpened  as  officers  and  members  of  the  council  initiate \nproposals  for  improving  and  maintaining  village roads  in  their  jurisdiction.  Based  on  proposals \ndeveloped  by  the  UCs  for  village  road  improvement,  they  will  be  allocated  project  funds  to \nmanage  directly  at  the  local  level with  appropriate  guidelines  and  safeguards.  The  capacity  of \nUCs  for  resource  management  will  be  further  enhanced  by  employing  an  accountant  at  each \nunion.  Tri-media  campaigns  explaining  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  UC  officials  will  be \nlaunched.  Diverse  issues  related  to  local  governance  such  as  transparency,  resource \nmobilization, cleanliness and hygiene, and law and order will be covered in TV and radio spots, \nand in posters and comic books to be distributed in villages.  \n \n30. \nTo  ensure  that  project  outputs  and  outcomes  are  achieved,  the  Project  has  created  a \nresults-based  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  that  will  allow  LGED  to  use  data  relating  to \nproject  results  to  support  more  effective  project  management.  This  results-based  management \n(RBM)  approach  will  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  Project  by  using  data  collected  by  project \nmonitoring and evaluation activities to allow the PMO and LGED to make management decisions in \na timely way and increase the likelihood of meeting output and outcome targets. \n \nD. \n \nThe estimated project investment cost is $260.5 million equivalent, inclusive of physical \n31. \nand price contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and service charges during construction. \nThe project investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nThe Government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to $96.1 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance 36.9% of the project cost. ADB financing of \nthe  Project  will  be  done  in  a  variety  of  financing  options.13  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncofinanced  by  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  in \nthe amount of up to $60.9 million equivalent and by the Government of the Federal Republic of \nGermany \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) in the amounts $3.6 million equivalent (in kind), and $21.6 \nmillion  equivalent,  respectively,  subject  to  the  approval  of  their  higher  authorities.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  equivalent  of  $78.3  million  (30.0%  of  the  project  cost),  including \ntaxes  and  duties.  A  part  of  the  DFID  grant  ($56.7  million  equivalent)  is  on  a  joint  basis  to  be \nadministered by ADB. The GTZ and KfW grants and a remaining portion of DFID grant are on a \nparallel basis. The Government has agreed to scale down the scope of the Project if cofinancing \ndoes not materialize. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2.  \n \n33. \nThe ADB loan of SDR64.766 million will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years. The loan will carry an interest of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. Interest during construction will be capitalized. \n \nF. \n \n\nthrough  Deutsche  Gesellschaft \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2006.

The project director will report to the chief engineer of LGED, \ncoordinate  all  project  activities,  and  be  directly  responsible  for  overall  implementation, \nmonitoring, and supervision. In addition to the project director, LGED will appoint three qualified \ndeputy  project  directors  (DPDs),  along  with  other  qualified  PMO  administrative  and  support \nstaff. Two of the deputy project directors will be posted in LGED\u2019s divisional offices in Rangpur \nand Mymensingh, while the DPD for Dhaka Division will be based in the PMO. The organization \nchart for project implementation is in Appendix 4. \n \n35. \nThe PMO will (i) prepare an overall project implementation plan and detailed designs; (ii)  \nsupervise  various  civil  works;  (iii)  organize  and  maintain  the  project  financial  accounts;  (iv) \nimplement the gender action, resettlement, and environmental management plans; (v) organize \nmonitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (vi)  prepare  progress  reports  and  a  project  completion  report. \nThe PMO will be assisted by consultants with expertise in engineering design and supervision, \neconomics  and \nfinance,  social  and  gender  development,  participatory  approaches, \nenvironmental  assessment,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  local  governance.  The  PMO  will \nwork  closely  with  the  staff  of  LGED  in  district  and  subdistrict  offices  and  coordinate  with  UCs \nand the management committees of the GCMs and the jetties in implementing relevant project \nactivities.  In  coordination  with  the  National  Institute  of  Local  Government,  the  PMO  will \nimplement capacity building for local government institutions (LGIs). \n\n2. \n\nImplementation of Subprojects \n\n \n \n36. \nThe  LGED  district  offices,  headed  by  executive  engineers,  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  subprojects  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO.  In  the  course  of  its  feasibility  study, \nLGED  has  carried  out  the  appraisal  of  434  subproject  roads,  167  GCMs,  and  a  sample  of  25 \nunion  roads.  Besides  technical  and  economic  viability,  the  subprojects  included  in  the  Project \nwere  prioritized  based  on  such  social  indicators  as  poverty,  gender  disparity,  environmental \nconditions, requirements for land acquisition and resettlement, and, in the case of subdistrict and \nunion roads, connectivity to markets and higher-order roads. Prior to detailed design, the selection \nof  the  roads  will  be  confirmed  with  the  local  community.  As  the  socioeconomic  conditions  are \ngenerally  homogeneous  among  subproject  areas  within  a  district,  the  social  analyses  will  be \ncarried out district-wide. The results will be submitted to ADB and the cofinanciers concerned. All \nsubprojects  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  and  requirements. \nDetails on the selection and prioritization of subprojects are set out in Appendix 7. \n \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n \n37. \nThe Project will be implemented over 5 years from the second half of 2006 and to the first \nhalf of 2011. The activities during the first year include recruiting consultants, preparing detailed \ndesigns  for  the  subprojects  to  be  implemented  in  Year  1,  and  procuring  office  and  construction \nequipment  and  vehicles.  Civil  works  are  expected  to  begin  during  the  first  quarter  of  2007  to \npermit  adequate  time  for  preparing  detailed  field  surveys  and  designs.  The  PMO  will  not  award \nany construction contract until the land and rights of way are available, free of encumbrances, for \nexecuting  them  and  necessary  resettlement  activities  and  appropriate  compensation  payments \nhave been completed. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\n4.  \n\nProcurement \n\n \n38. \n Goods,  services,  and  civil  works  financed  by  ADB  and  KfW  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Since the civil works will be small and widely dispersed, foreign \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ncontractors are unlikely to be interested in bidding. Consequently, all civil work contracts will be \nprocured  by  national  competitive  bidding  among  qualified  contractors  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contract  awards  for  all  works \nestimated to cost more than $300,000 equivalent will require prior approval of ADB and KfW, as \nappropriate.  Bid  evaluation  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  KfW  for  approval  only  for \ncontracts  above  $300,000.  Contracts  for  rural  roads  (excepting  village  roads),  structures  on \nsubdistrict and union roads, GCMs, UCCs, jetties, functional buildings, and flood refuge centers \nwill  generally  be  awarded  by  the  LGED  executive  engineer  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO, \nwhile  the  contracts  for  structures  on  village  roads  will  be  awarded  by  the  LGED  subdistrict \nengineer  concerned,  under  the  guidance  of  the  PMO  and  executive  engineer.  UCs  will \nimplement  resectioning  of  the  village  roads  with  LCSs  and  with  the  assistance  of  LGED \nsubdistrict  engineers.  Contract  documents  for  procuring  these  works  will  be  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  guidelines  on  LCSs  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  ensure  efficiency  and  economy  in \ncontract  administration,  small  contracts  for  roads  and  related  improvement  works  at  various \nconstruction sites can be grouped together to obtain higher value. The construction of roads and \nassociated structures such as bridges and culverts will be closely coordinated to maximize the \nutilization  of  the  completed  facilities.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  award  one  contract  for  the \nconstruction of each subdistrict road. Efforts will also be made to limit the number of contracts \nand  engage  larger  contractors.  This  approach  will  shorten  the  construction  period  and  ensure \naccountability  and  a  higher  quality  of  work.  LGED  will  award  contracts  for  infrastructure \nconstruction that prioritize the involvement of poor people, particularly women. Contractors will \nbe  required  to  achieve  parity  in  the  payment  of  wages  to  men  and  women  for  work  of  equal \nvalue and regularly pay their construction workers, both women and men. Contractors who fail \nto perform satisfactorily  will not be allowed to participate in the bidding for subsequent contracts \nunder the Project. \n \n39. \n Equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured,  depending  on  the  contract  value,  by  (i) \ninternational  competitive  bidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000  equivalent,  (ii) \nlimited International bidding when the estimated cost is $300,000 to $500,000 equivalent, and (iii) \nnational competitive bidding when the estimated cost is $300,000 or less. The PMO will procure \nequipment and vehicles. LGED prepared a procurement plan for the initial 18 months, included as \nAppendix 6 and in greater detail in Supplementary Appendix X. The procurement plan includes (i) \nparticular contracts for the goods, works, and services required to carry out the Project during the \ninitial  18  months,  (ii)  proposed  methods  for  procuring  contracts  that  are  permitted  under  the \nfinancing  agreement,  and  (iii)  related  ADB  review  procedures.  LGED  has  agreed  to  update  the \nprocurement plan annually or as needed throughout project implementation. \n \n\n5.  Consulting Services  \n \nThree  packages  of  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  support  project  management \n\n40. \nand strengthen the capacity of LGED and LGIs: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe first package will consist of design, supervision, and monitoring consultants \nservices, including 152 person-months of international and 1,504 person-months \nof national consultancy. Consultant services will be provided by an international \nfirm  in  association  with  a  national  firm(s)  and  will  be  selected  by  quality-  and \ncost-based selection.   \nThe second package will provide institutional strengthening and training support \nto LGIs, consisting of 138 person-months of national consultancy. The consultant \nfirm  will  be  selected  and  engaged  on  the  basis  of  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection and a full technical proposal. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  third  package  will  consist  of  36  person-months  of  international  and  552 \nperson-months of national consultancy to assist in building LGED capacity. GTZ \nwill provide these consulting services under the parallel cofinancing arrangement.  \n\n \nThe  consultants  mentioned  in  (i)  and  (ii)  above  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  LGED  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference \nand a personnel schedule for the project consultants are in Appendix 9.   \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n \n6. \n \n41. \nLand  acquisition  requirements  for  subdistrict  roads  under  the  Project  will  be  minimal. \nLand  required  for  the  road  and  other  infrastructure  improvement  is  mainly  within  the  existing \nright  of  way  or  owned  by  the  Government.  In  the  course  of  the  consultations  held  with \nstakeholders, landowners along the road alignments indicated their willingness to donate narrow \nstrips of their land to expedite road upgrading. To minimize delays due to land acquisition, the \nlocation  of  project  infrastructure  will  be  carefully  selected.  LGED,  in  cooperation  with  the  UC \nconcerned, will complete the preparatory work for land acquisition in line with the provisions of \nthe country\u2019s Land Acquisition Law of 1982. Actual land acquisition under each subproject will \nbe completed by LGED  within 1.5 years following the completion of the detailed design of the \nrespective civil work activity, or else the civil work activity will be excluded from the subproject. \nShould any subproject require resettlement, a district-level social analyses will be prepared and \nsubmitted  to  ADB,  including  (i)  an  initial  environmental  examination  as  required  under  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy16 and (ii) a resettlement plan as required under ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement.17  LGED  will  disclose  resettlement  plans  to  affected  people.  Land  acquisition, \npayment  of  compensation,  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  completed  before  LGED  awards \nany contract for the subproject. \n \nMaintenance \n \n\n7. \n\nThe district office of LGED will be responsible for routine and periodic maintenance as \n42. \nwell  as  for  repairs  necessitated  by  recurring  flood  damage.  Historically,  funds  allocated  for \nmaintenance have fallen short of requirements, but the financing gap has narrowed. In FY2002, \na  gap  of  about  Tk1.4  billion,  representing  43%  of  the  requirement,  was  reported.  By  FY2005, \nthe  gap  had  fallen  to  Tk436  million,  or  8%  of  the  requirement.  By  ensuring  the  high  quality  of \nconstruction and following design specifications strictly, the need for road maintenance will be \nminimized.  With  the  assistance  of  UCs,  LGED  subdistrict  engineers  will  engage  LCSs, \nconsisting  mostly  of  poor  women,  to  undertake  routine  off-pavement  maintenance,  planting \ntrees,  and  caring  for  them.  On-pavement  maintenance  will  be  carried  out  by  LGED  district \nteams.  LGED  will  field  at  least  two  additional  mobile  teams  per  district  to  meet  expanded \nrequirements. In line with existing practice, periodic maintenance, carried out every 5 years on \naverage, will be executed by the contractors engaged by LGED. Consultants will prepare site-\nspecific  maintenance  manuals  that  describe  the  maintenance  procedures  to  be  followed  by \nsubdistrict engineers, LCSs, and local contractors. Consultants will conduct on-the-job training \nto  ensure  that  subdistrict  engineers,  LCSs,  and  local  contractors  are  familiar  with  their \nresponsibilities.  The  Government  undertakes  to  provide  adequate  funds  to  LGED  to  cover  the \nannual maintenance requirements of the infrastructure completed under the Project. UCs will be \nresponsible  for  maintaining  village  roads.  Using  part  of  their  budgetary  allocations  from  the \ncentral Government, UCs will engage LCSs for restoring with earthworks the alignment of any \ndamaged village road.  \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2002.

Payments  for  eligible  items  will  be  made  through  this \naccount.  A  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  adopted \nfacilitate \nreimbursement and the liquidation of small contracts. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The ceiling \nof  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  ADB-financed  expenditures  for  6  months,  or \n10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The SOE procedure will be used for reimbursing \nand liquidating eligible expenditures for single transactions below $100,000 equivalent. German \nfinancing  through  KfW  will  be  implemented  as  parallel  financing,  covering  the  four  districts  of \nGaibanda, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, and Nilphamari. KfW grant funds will be disbursed in a similar \nway under the KfW\u2019s Disposition Fund Procedure. \n \n \n \n44. \nThe PMO will prepare quarterly progress reports on project implementation and submit \nthe  reports  to  ADB  and  the  project  cofinanciers.  The  report  will  focus  on  RBM,  including  the \nphysical progress of works and the status of poverty reduction, gender empowerment, and local \ngovernance  improvement  activities,  as  well  as  addressing  the  progress  in  meeting  the  project \noutcome and outputs. Within 3 months of substantial physical completion of the Project, LGED \nwill  submit  to  ADB  and  the  project  cofinanciers  a  project  completion  report  that  will  cover  the \ndetails  of  project  implementation,  cost,  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  and \nimprovements in local governance. \n \n45. \nLGED  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to  facilitate  the  identification  of \nexpenditures and income related to the Project. Sufficient and qualified accounting staff will be \nassigned to the PMO. External auditors acceptable to the ADB and DFID will annually audit all \naccounts  and  statements  of  expenditures  and  revenues  related  to  the  Project.  The  Foreign \nAided Project Audit Directorate is considered acceptable for this purpose. The annual audit will \ninclude an audit of imprest accounts and SOE procedures. The annual audit report will include a \nseparate audit opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and SOE procedure. Audited financial \nstatements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  will  be  submitted  to \nADB and the project cofinanciers within 6 months of the close of the financial year.  \n \n \n \n46. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  will  be  strictly  applied  under  the  Project.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and  LGED. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  related  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and DFID in connection \nwith  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of the LGED and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  Anticorruption  and  fiduciary  risk  measures  will  meet  or \nexceed  DFID\u2019s  requirements.  The  Project  will  incorporate  the  following  measures  to  foster \nanticorruption efforts:  \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n10. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTo strengthen internal control, 10 regional superintending engineer positions will \nbe established as permanent positions, to be funded under the revenue budget, \nwhose  role  is  to  in  enhance  construction  quality  control  and  supervise  effective \nwork. \nConstruction supervision consultants will support LGED\u2019s regional offices\u2019 efforts \nto  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and \nin  project \noperations. \nAn external performance-audit team acceptable to the ADB will be engaged by the \nGovernment to monitor and report on physical performance under the Project.  \n\ntransparency \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation      \n\n \nAs  one  anticorruption  measure,  LGED  will,  in  consultation  with  the  National  Institute  of  Local \nGovernment,  implement  the  action  plan  for  local  governance  and  so  empower  UCs,  update \nrules  and  regulations,  and  enhance  transparency  in  UC  operations.  The  PMO  will  make \navailable on the LGED\u2019s website the detailed information on the use of project funds. \n \n \n \n47. \nA  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  will  be  established  and  operated \nunder  the  Project.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  support  the  data  requirements  of  a  fully \nintegrated RBM system. Using the RBM system will ensure that deviations between the project \nplan  and  achieved  results  (outputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts)  are  recognized  by  project \nmanagement  in  a  timely  manner,  thereby  allowing  effective  corrective  actions  and  decisions. \nThe  PMO  will,  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  conduct  benchmark  physical  and \nsocioeconomic surveys in each project district and submit to ADB and the project cofinanciers, \nfor  their  review  and  approval,  a  detailed  PPMS  implementation  plan.  Throughout  project \nimplementation, the PMO will submit annual monitoring reports to ADB and the cofinanciers.  \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Reviews  \n\n \nRegular  reviews  conducted  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the  cofinanciers  will  cover \n48. \nphysical  implementation,  financial  performance,  the  implementation  of  action  plans,  and  the \nidentification of problems that may require early attention. The Government, ADB, DFID, GTZ, \nand KfW will jointly conduct a comprehensive midterm review (MTR) in the third year of project \nimplementation.  The  MTR  will  evaluate  (i)  project  design,  (ii)  stakeholder  participation,  (iii)  the \nquality  of  works,  (iv)  social  and  environmental  impacts,  (v)  capacity  building,  (vi)  compliance \nwith  loan  covenants,  (vii)  the  improvement  of  local  governance,  (viii)  the  effectiveness  of \nimplementation  arrangements  and  project  management  structures,  (ix)  the  attainment  of \noperation and maintenance budget for sustainable maintenance, and (x) future implementation \nplans for the remaining works. The results of the MTR will guide modifications to the scope and \ndesign of the Project and, if needed, the reallocation of funds among the loan categories.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nThe  results  of  the  economic  analyses  show  that  the  Project  is  economically  viable.  The \n49. \ntwo  major  components  (roads  and  markets),  accounting  for  about  80%  of  project  costs,  were \nevaluated  separately.  The  combined  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  all  subdistrict \nroads is 28.4%, with a range of 12-50% for individual roads. The combined EIRR for all markets is \n51%. The summary economic analysis is in Appendix 10. In addition to the quantifiable benefits of \nthe  two  components,  other  nonquantified  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  are  time  savings  for \nroad  users,  better  access  to  markets  and  essential  services,  lower  prices  for  farm  inputs  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nconsumable  goods,  better  marketing  opportunities,  and  increased  employment  opportunities  in \nroad and market construction, maintenance, and roadside tree plantation programs.  \n \n50. \nRoad improvement will permit more reliable access to social and financial services and \nagricultural and livestock extension. Providing submersible roads will reduce travel time during \nthe  dry  season  in  low-lying  areas.  Constructing  jetties  will  facilitate  the  safe  loading  and \nunloading of goods and passengers. Constructing flood refuge shelters will save the lives and \nproperty  of  rural  people  living  in  areas  prone  to  flash  floods.  Constructing  UCCs  will  provide \none-stop centers for various services for rural people. The program to develop human resources \nproposed  under  various  components  of  the  Project  will  expand  the  knowledge  and  skills  of \nproject personnel and enhance how efficiently they perform their day-to-day activities.  \n \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impacts \n\n51. \nThe  Project  will  help  reduce  poverty  by  about  7%  in  the  rural  communities  it  covers.  The \nbeneficiaries  will  be  road  users\u2014bus  and  truck  owners  and  operators,  passengers,  and  cargo \nmovers\u2014as well as the general population in the area of influence, numbering about 6 million, 50% \nof  whom  live  below  the  poverty  line.  Direct  employment  generated  by  the  construction  of  project \nfacilities  is  estimated  at  52,800  person-years.  After  project  completion,  3,200  new  jobs  will  be \ncreated for maintaining the roads, with 30% of the labor for road maintenance provided by women.  \nIn  addition,  2,600  new  jobs  will  be  created  for  poor  women  who  will  plant  trees  along  subdistrict \nroads and then care for them, along with another 1,200 new jobs for women in operating retail areas \nassigned  to  them  at  GCMs.  Indirect  project  benefits  likely  to  facilitate  poverty  reduction  are \nincreases  in  farm  income,  estimated  at  about  20%,  largely  from  15%  higher  crop  yields  resulting \nfrom a 45% improvement in the availability and use of fertilizer and other inputs. \n \n52. \nThe  Project  will  also  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  a  number  of  indirect, \nunquantifiable  ways:  (i)  the  availability  of  improved  transport  will  facilitate  the  migration  of \nunderemployed  farm  labor  to  alternative  employment  opportunities;  (ii)  the  cost-effective \ntransport  of  produce  will  help  farm  producers  realize  higher  farm  gate  prices;  (iii)  improved \nroads  will  enable  easy  access  to  rural  areas  for  service  providers  including  healthcare, \neducation,  and  agricultural  extension  workers,  as  well  as  nongovernment  organization \npersonnel;  and  (iv)  the  additional  traffic  volume  will  give  rise  to  transport-related  small \nbusinesses such as service stations, repair shops, food stalls, and guesthouses. Thus, on the \nwhole,  the  Project  will  not  only  reduce  poverty  but  also  improve  the  people\u2019s  prospects  for  a \nbetter life. Appendix 11 gives the summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n53. \nImprovements in the rural transport and trading systems, along with the development of \nthe  UCCs  for  delivering  social  services  to  rural  people,  will  yield  significant  positive  social \nimpacts, particularly for women and children. The participatory approach to development will be \ninstitutionalized in LGED as a standard procedure for packaging projects. This will maximize the \ninputs from all stakeholders in the Project and ensure consensus. The mobility of rural women \nwill increase, which will help them to participate in local governance and decision making and to \nraise  their  voices  to  demand  their  rights  and  access  to  resources.  This  will  improve  poor \nwomen\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  household  income  and  increase  awareness  regarding  health, \nhygiene,  sanitation,  and  the  importance  of  education  for  their  children,  thereby  discouraging \nchild  labor.  Flood  refuge  shelters  will  reduce  the  loss  of  valuable  household  assets  during \nserious  flash  floods.  This  will  especially  benefit  the  poor,  who  have  only  a  few  essential \npossessions.  The  submersible  roads  will  overcome  dry-season  isolation  of  haor  areas,  which \nlimits  social,  cultural,  and  economic  development.  Safer  loading  and  unloading  facilities  at  the \njetties will reduce injuries and accidents where most of the victims are poor. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nResettlement \n\nD. \n \n54. \nAdverse  socioeconomic  impacts  may  result  from  land  acquisition  and  the  relocation  of \nstructures  from  the  proposed  right  of  way.  The  acquisition  of  narrow  strips  of  land  required  for \nwidening  and  straightening  existing  roads  will  have  minimum  impact  on  individuals.  Growth \ncenters will be developed on available government land, and UCCs on land already donated by \ncommunity  residents.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  (Appendix  12)  covering \ninvoluntary resettlement for road improvement and voluntary relocation for developing GCMs and \nUCCs following ADB resettlement policies. In line with the resettlement impact assessment of the \nthree  core  subprojects,  one  full  resettlement  plan  and  two  short  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared.  To  the  extent  that  the  detailed  design  for  the  subprojects  confirm  the  need  for \nresettlement  plans,  the  resettlement  framework  and  plans  will  be  followed  when  preparing  and \nimplementing  specific  resettlement  plans  that  may  be  required  under  the  Project.  Indigenous \npeoples are not found in the core subproject areas. Any impact on indigenous peoples in non-core \nsubproject areas will be mitigated through specific action embedded in the resettlement plan.  \n \nE. \n \n55.  Women  in  the  project  area  are  mostly  engaged  in  household  and  farming  activities. \nUnder the Project, the following activities will be pursued to empower rural women:  \n\nGender and Development Issues \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ninvolving \n\nfor  women  by \n\nincreasing  women\u2019s  participation  to  at  least  30%  of  total  membership  in  project \nplanning implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and maintenance;  \ngenerating  employment  opportunities \nin \nconstruction,  maintenance,  and  tree  plantation  activities  through  LCSs  and  by \nensuring  that,  during  construction,  female  laborers  are  provided  with  temporary \nsheds, water, and sanitary facilities;  \nfacilitating  rural  female  beneficiaries\u2019  links  to  different  support  resources  to \nsustain their livelihood; \ndeveloping the entrepreneurship of women by reserving for them market sections \nin GCMs (female shop owners will be linked with microfinance institutions so that \nthey can run their business and contribute to the rural economy); and  \npromoting \nmanagement of UCs. \n\nfemale  members\u2019  participation \n\nlocal  governance  and \n\nthem \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n56. \nThe  capacity-building  component  of  the  Project  will  incorporate  gender  concerns  by \ninvolving women and training them in (i) skills for income-generating activities, (ii) off-pavement \nmaintenance, tree planting, and tree care as members of LCSs, and (iii) shop management and \ntrade  skills  development.  Under  the  Project,  15%  of  the  space  for  trading  will  be  reserved  for \nwomen (Appendix 13). The female shop owners will form an association and will be represented \nin  MMCs  and  citizen  forums.  Through  a  series  of  workshops,  female  UC  members  will  learn \nhow  to  prepare  budgets,  keep  accounts,  conduct  meetings,  and  participate  in  social  activities. \nThis  will  develop  their  capacity  and  enhance  efficiency.  The  Project  will  considerably  facilitate \nchild development by (i) increasing family income and so reducing the incidence of child labor, \n(ii)  increasing  access  for  the  children  of  disadvantaged  families  and  for  youths  to  skills \ndevelopment; and (iii) ensuring greater health benefits through improving access for the poor to \nhealth  services.  Over  the  long-run,  activities  addressing  women\u2019s  empowerment  will  help  to \nnarrow the gender gap in Bangladesh. \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n57. \nAs  the  interventions  under  this  Project  deal  primarily  with  road  improvement,  no  new \nroad construction is envisaged, so adverse environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nThey  can  be  reduced  further  through  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  The  potential \nenvironmental impacts are either short term in the construction stage or long term in the post-\nintervention  stage.  Potential  short-term  adverse  impacts  include  soil  erosion,  water  pollution, \nblocked drainage, traffic disruption and accident hazards, and dust and noise pollution. These \ncan  be  minimized  by  (i)  limiting  earthworks  to  the  dry  season,  (ii)  carefully  planning  drainage \ndiversions,  (iii)  restoring  and  rehabilitating  borrow  pits,  (iv)  safely  transporting  and  storing \nconstruction materials, (v) spraying water to reduce dust hazards, and (vi) prohibiting the use of \nmachinery after sunset to reduce noise pollution. \n \n58. \nIn  the  long  run,  the  Project  will  (i)  benefit  the  environment  by  planting  trees  along \nroadsides,  which  will  also  prevent  soil  erosion  from  embankment  slopes;  (ii)  improve  regional \nhydrology  by  reconstructing  and  rehabilitating  cross-drainage  structures,  (iii)  reduce  dust \npollution  and  improve  water  quality  by  bituminizing  the  pavement,  (iv)  facilitate  and  improve \naccess to markets for trade and income generation, (v) allow easy movement of motorized and \nother  traffic,  and  (vi)  generally  improve  the  aesthetic  quality  of  the  region.  In  addition,  market \nimprovement  measures  will  enhance \nthe  environmental  quality  of  GCMs.  Community \nmanagement  and  ownership  of  planted  trees  has  been  used  in  other  projects,  including  rural \ninfrastructure-development projects, and the lessons learned in those projects suggest that the \napproach taken under the Project should be effective.   \n \nThe  potential  adverse  impacts  from  project  interventions  may  include  disrupted  fishing \n59. \nactivities, flooding from drain congestion, the loss of trees, and the loss of agricultural land and \nother assets from road widening. The only ecologically sensitive area in the project area is the \nMadhupur Forest. The Project includes no intervention in this zone that may adversely affect its \necology.  Likewise,  careful  planning  will  be  done  during  the  design  and  construction  of \nsubmersible  roads  in  the  haor  areas  in  Netrokona  and  Kishoreganj  districts.  All  potential \nnegative impacts will be minimized by adopting such mitigation measures as (i) tree planting on \nroadsides  to  stabilize  soil  and  compensate  for  tree  removal;  (ii)  providing  adequate,  and \nsufficient  numbers  of,  cross-drainage  structures  to  facilitate  fish  migration  and  flood  passage; \nand  (iii)  careful  road  alignment  during  road  widening  to  minimize  farmland  and  asset  loss.  A \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) for the project area was undertaken with a focus on three core \nsubprojects  that  identifies  both  positive  and  negative  impacts,  suggests  mitigation  measures, \nand outlines monitoring needs. Recruiting additional expertise in environmental assessment and \nmonitoring will help enhance the capability of the environmental unit of LGED. \n \nG. \n \n60. \nThe Project will strengthen local government institutions such as UCs, not only through a \nseries  of  training  programs  for  UC  members  and  staff  but  also  by  providing  them  with  project \nfunds. Under the Project, UCs will gain, through a participatory approach, hands-on experience in \npreparing small projects, in this case to improve village roads, and seeing to their implementation \nunder transparent procedures with technical guidance from LGED. The UCs that perform credibly \nin  this  regard  will  receive  additional  funds  for  a  second  project.  This  process  will  show  UC \nmembers  that  good  performance  is  rewarded,  thus  preparing  them  to  take  on  greater \nresponsibilities in the future. An action plan for improving local governance is in Appendix 14. \n\nImpact on Local Governance \n\nH. \n\n \nRisks  \n\nThe risks faced by the Project are manageable and will be largely mitigated in the course \n61. \nof project implementation. Potential delays in project start-up will be reduced by taking advance \naction to recruit consultants. Some contractors\u2019 limited experience in implementing foreign-aided \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nthem  under \n\nto  strengthening \n\nthe  current  drive \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  standard \n\nprojects  will  be  remedied  by  their  participation  in  training  programs  under  the  Project.  Using \nADB\u2019s  and \ntender  procedures  will  minimize  delays.  The \nGovernment commitment of counterpart funding through budgetary allocations will be required \nbefore ADB approves contract awards. \n \n62.  While  local  government  institutions  have  some  organizational  weaknesses,  the  central \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment \ntoward \ndecentralization  will  mitigate  this  risk.  Furthermore,  the  provisions  under  the  Project  for \naugmenting  the  capabilities  of  the  officers  and  members  of  UCs  will  reduce  the  risk.  Training \nprograms  under  the  Project  will  raise  the  level  of  awareness  among  stakeholders  about  local \ngovernance issues. \n \nThe fiscal sustainability of previous projects has been an issue in respect to financing road \n63. \nmaintenance. Although the funds made available have historically fallen short of requirements, the \ngap  has  narrowed  considerably.  The  gap  between  total  requirements  and  actual  allocation \ndropped from 43% in 2002 to less than 10% in 2005. The Government has agreed to close the \ngap by increasing budgetary allocations to LGED. The Government\u2019s commitment to development \npartners to introduce a mechanism for assured funding of road maintenance will reduce this risk \nsignificantly. Another dimension of fiscal sustainability that is specific to the Project pertains to the \nparticipation of UCs in implementing the village road component. This is a new activity that has \nbeen included in the Project following the central Government\u2019s grant  of an annual allocation to \neach UC (amounting to Tk646,000 in 2005) to meet developmental and operational needs. Using \npart  of  the  annual  budget,  UCs  will  contribute  10%  of  the  cost  of  improving  village  roads, \nestimated  at  Tk18,300  per  km.  Implementing  village  road  components  will  gradually  empower \nUCs  in  project  planning  and  design  after  UC  members  and  staff  have  undertaken  intensive \ntraining in these fields. Considering the low cost of labor-intensive maintenance of village roads, \nthe  funding  needs  can  be  met  from  the  UCs  annual  budgetary  allocation.  Under  these \narrangements,  and  given  the  regular  budgetary  allocations  to  UCs,  the  risks  associated  with \nimplementing the village road component are considered to be minimal. \n \n64. \nDuring  construction,  the  incidence  of  direct  and  indirect  child  labor  in  the  Project  may \nincrease,  especially  in  construction  support  services  such  as  stone-  and  brick-breaking,  non-\nmotorized transportation, brick manufacturing, and other service industries that tend to employ \nchild labor. Encouraging income-generating schemes and micro-enterprises may also result in \nincreased child labor. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  LGED  have  given  the \n\n \n65. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  shall  approve  by  31  December  2009  the  revised  GCM \nmanagement  committee  guidelines  that  cover  the  increased  responsibility  of  the \nUCs  and  their  increased  share  from  the  market  lease  income  to  cover  the  cost  of \noperation and maintenance of GCMs. \nThe Government shall undertake all necessary actions so that,  \n(a) \n\nby  31  December  2007,  (i)  10  permanent  positions  of  superintending \nengineers  funded  from  the  revenue  budget  are  established  at  LGED  to \nenhance  construction  quality  control  and  supervision,  and  oversee \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nregional  training  programs,  (ii)  10  additional  permanent  positions  of \nexecutive  engineers  funded  from  the  revenue  budget  are  established  at \nthe regional offices of LGED to conduct and implement necessary training \nprograms,  both  on-the-job  training  and  through  workshops,  and  (iii)  64 \nsocial scientists for the approved positions are appointed, one for each of \nthe district offices of LGED; and,  \nby 31 December 2008,  (i) an accountant assistant is appointed for each \nUC  to  strengthen  its  financial  transparency;  (ii)  LGED  has  a  fully \noperational design and planning unit staffed with full-time personnel; and \n(iii) an additional four engineers and five supporting staff are recruited for \nthe procurement unit of the LGED. \n\n(b) \n\n(v) \n\n(iii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(iv) \n\n(vii) \n\nBefore 30 June of each year during project implementation, LGED and ADB shall \nagree  on  the  annual  maintenance  program,  including  the  required  budget,  for \nsubdistrict and union roads in the project area for the following year.

The rural economy accounts for about 60% \nof  GDP.  Over  the  past  decade,  the  development  of  rural  transport  and  communications \nnetworks and widespread access to primary education and basic health facilities have enabled \nrural Bangladesh to emerge from its isolation. A more mobile, healthier, and more literate rural \npopulation has taken advantage of a wide range of off-farm employment opportunities, including \nsome linked to the farm sector and others located in the urban and peri-urban areas of the main \ncities.  Some  3  million  Bangladeshis  now  work  abroad,  and  their  remittances  have  financed  a \nvast  array  of  new  rural  businesses.  Developing  the  infrastructure  and  institutions  to  support \nbroad-based  rural  development  is  essential  to  generating  employment  and  livelihoods  for  the \nrural poor.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nMany  rural  communities  lack  road  links,  while  others  suffer  from  underinvestment  in \noperation  and  maintenance.  Local  governments  have  had  limited  involvement  in  the  design, \nimplementation,  and  management  of  rural  infrastructure.  Greater  local  participation  in  the \nprovision of local infrastructure is necessary to ensure that (i) what is constructed improves rural \nmarket  access;  (ii)  rural  infrastructure  development  creates  opportunities  for  the  poor, \nparticularly  women,  to  access  the  core  economic  and  local  governance  infrastructure;  and \n(iii) what is built can be used effectively and sustained in the long run. \n \nGovernment\u2019s Strategy \nC. \n \n \n3. \nThe national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) emphasizes that rural development will \ngenerate  employment  and  sustainable  livelihood  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor.  The  NPRS \nprioritizes  (i)  accelerated  growth  in  rural  areas,  and  development  of  agriculture  and  nonfarm \neconomic  activities;  (ii)  fostering  the  growth  of  rural  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs); (iii) rural infrastructure improvements, including measures to reduce natural and human \ninduced shocks; and (iv) improved access to information and communications technology (ICT). \nDiversification  and  off-farm  employment  promotion  are  the  two  pillars  of  the  Government\u2019s \nagriculture and rural development strategy.  \n \nD. \n  \n4. \nTo  foster  a  diversified  rural  economy  and  reduce  rural  poverty,  more  attention  will  be \npaid  to  improving  rural  roads  and  waterways  to  connect  poor  rural  communities  to  major \nmarkets. Assistance will be provided to fund the maintenance of feeder roads and rural roads. \nLow-cost  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  schemes  will  be  promoted  actively  and  included, \nwhere  feasible.  Transfer  of  ownership  and  responsibility  for  maintenance  will  be  delegated  to \nlocal governments, where possible. Adoption of sustainable rural road sector policies targeting \nthe  needs  of  the  poor,  women,  excluded  groups,  and  persons  with  special  needs  will  be \nsupported actively. \n \nE. \n \n5. \nPublic  investment  in  rural  development  must  be  planned  in  a  coordinated  and  holistic \nmanner.  Wherever  possible,  public and  private  partnerships will  be  promoted  in  recognition  of \n\nImplementation and Monitoring \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22          Appendix 1 \n\nthe  key  role  of  the  private  sector  in  fostering  rural  development.  Current  levels  of  community \nparticipation, women\u2019s empowerment, local cofinancing, and project ownership are inadequate \nand need to be strengthened. More effective local governance will be stressed by boosting the \ncapabilities, financing, and authorities of local bodies. Effective and participatory monitoring and \nevaluation  of  development  interventions  are  essential  to  ensure  that  investments  in  rural \ndevelopment achieve desired results. \n \n\n \n\nTable A1: Sector Roadmap \n\nItem \n  \n1.

Subdistrict  engineers  consulted  with  the  members  of  union  councils  regarding \nrural  roads  and  markets  that  need  improvement  in  their  respective  jurisdictions.  The  country\u2019s \nrural  road  network  was  initially  constructed  as  embankments  under  food-for-work  programs  in \nthe 1960s and 1970s. The alignments of all proposed roads already exist, and selection of the \nproject  roads  is  confined  to  these  alignments.  Due  to  the  serious  problems  associated  with \nacquiring new rights of way, no new road alignment wills be built apart from those on existing \nembankments. \n \n2. \nAfter a list of possible subprojects had been prepared, the proposals are then ranked in \naccordance  with  agreed  criteria.  The  prioritization  criteria  apply  to  the  following  works:  \nsubdistrict  and  union  roads,  village  roads,  growth  center  markets,  jetties,  and  union  council \ncomplexes.  The  criteria  were  used  in  preparing  the  final  list  of  subprojects  included  in  the \nProject. \n \n3. \nThe  prioritizing  criteria  fall  under  the  following  five  main  aspects:  (i)  economic,  (ii) \ntechnical/engineering, (iii) equity, (iv) environmental, and (v) social. These are discussed below. \nEconomic. The overarching criterion is that the economic internal rate of return \nfor the selected subproject should be at least 12%. \nTechnical/engineering  criteria. These criteria establish the technical feasibility \nof constructing the subproject.   \nEquity. Each subdistrict should have at least one subdistrict road and/or growth \ncenter market. This criteria ensures that the development assistance is equitably \ndistributed to all parts of the project area. \nEnvironmental criteria. Drawn mainly from the Government\u2019s own guidelines in \nproject preparation, these criteria include the following: (a) no subproject will be \nimplemented in the Sundarbans or similarly protected area; (b) the extent of no \nperennial water body is to be reduced below that of February 1995 as a result of \nthe Project; (c) no registered historic building or cultural sites would be adversely \naffected; and (d) land acquisition should be minimal. \nSocial criteria. Subprojects that qualify on the basis of the first four criteria are \nthen  screened  further  based  each  subproject\u2018s  contribution  to  achieving  the \nbroad  goals  of  the  Project  in  (a)  poverty  reduction,  (b)  expanding  opportunities \nfor women, and (c) minimizing land acquisition and resettlement. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\nThe applicable criteria for each of the major project components are listed below. \n(i) \n\nSubdistrict and union roads. These should \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\nhave a high degree of connectivity; \nhave an existing crest width of at least 4 meters for their entire length; \nserve  educational  institutions,  village  markets,  banks,  and  other  social \ninstitutions; \ncreate  opportunities  for  marketing  the  hinterland\u2019s  agricultural,  fishery, \nand other products; \nhave  high  potential  for  generating  the  employment  of  poor  men  and \nwomen; \nserve people living in relatively inaccessible, remote, and poor areas; \nconnect the hinterlands with healthcare and other daily facilities; \n\n(f) \n(g) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n  \n\n \n4. \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(i) \nVillage roads. These should \n(a) \n(b) \n\nAppendix 7          33 \n\n(h) \n\nimprove linkage with the regional transport network including railways and \nwaterways; and \nhave minimal requirements for land allocation and resettlement. \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\nhave a minimum crest width of 2.5 meters, \nhave an existing minimum height that exceeds the highest recorded flood \nin the village and nearby areas, \nnot require land acquisition and resettlement, \nconnect to either a higher-order road that is paved and/or a growth center \nmarket, \nserve people living in relatively poor and remote areas, and \nserve people who are willing to participate in the long-term maintenance \nof the road. \nStructures on rural roads. \n(a) \n\nAll  damaged  bridges  and  culverts  on  selected  subdistrict,  union,  and \nvillage roads will be upgraded. \nAll other existing gaps in the selected subdistrict, union, and village roads \nwill be closed. \n\n(e) \n(f) \n\n(b) \n\nGrowth centers. These should \n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\nserve relatively large populations and areas, \nbe  situated  relatively  distant  from  subdistrict  towns  and  other  growth \ncenters, \nhave relatively high concentrations of permanent shops, \nserve significant education, health and other social institutions, \nhave hinterlands with diversified agriculture and various cash crops, \nhave  relatively  high  potential  for  generating  employment  outside  of \nagriculture, \nhave good communication systems and electricity connections, \nhave scope for physical expansion, \nhave relatively high lease value, \nbe connected to the proposed project road or any other paved road, and \nhave available land for constructing improved market facilities. \n\n(g) \n(h) \n(i) \n(j) \n(k) \nJetties. These should \n(a) \n(b) \n\nbe attached to a growth center; \nconnect  roads,  preferably  paved  roads,  and  preferably  proposed  project \nroads; \nbe used for landing river-borne passengers and goods; \nbe used for multiple purposes; \nhandle a large variety of commodities for in-bound and out-bound traffic; \nhave relatively low vulnerability to river erosion; and \nhave high lease revenue. \n\n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \nUnion council complexes. These should  \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n\nbe connected to the project road system, \nbe centrally located in the union area, \nhave no existing premises or old, damaged office buildings, \nbe located in a market place and served by other offices, \nhave an electricity connection, and \nbe ready to contribute the equivalent of 5% of the construction cost  to be \nused for complex maintenance. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34          Appendix 8 \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nLESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS ADB-ASSISTED PROJECTS \n\nIN THE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR \n \n\n1. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  direct  financial  assistance  to  the  rural  infrastructure \nsector  of  Bangladesh  started  in  1988  with  the  approval  of  Loan  No.  908-BAN  (SF),  the  (first) \nRural  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  also  known  as  RDP-13  in  the  Government  official \nrecords1  and  RIDP-1  in  ADB.

Even among \nthe civil works items, the development of physical infrastructure that would help strengthen local \ngovernance came somewhat later.

The \nLocal  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  capability  in  this  regard \nneeds to be enhanced. \nTo increase the revenue available for operating and maintaining rural markets, the \nleasing  procedures  currently  used  for  rural  markets  should  be  strengthened  to \nallow for greater transparency, competition, and beneficiary participation.  \n\nThe project completion report of RIDP-2,5 lists the following lessons learned: \n(i) \n\nThe local people were not fully aware of the use of the office buildings provided \nfor  the  union  market  management  committee.  Involving  local  government \ninstitutions  (LGIs)  and  local  residents  in  project  design  and  implementation  is \nrequisite to the sustainability of project facilities. \nAn adequate number of local contractors is not available in rural areas. Providing \nrepeated  training  for  contractors  effectively  enhances  their  capability  and \nimproves  the  quality  of  their  work.  The  lease  rates  for  construction  equipment \nwere low relative to prevailing market rates, prompting some contractors to keep \nthe  leased  equipment  on  site  without  using  it.  The  equipment  would  be  better \nutilized and maintained if owned by contractors. \nThe  involvement  of  labor  contracting  societies  (LCSs)  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  helped  increase  participation  and  users\u2019  responsibility  in \nconstructing  and  maintaining  rural  infrastructure.  This  provided  employment \nopportunities  to  destitute  rural  women  and  encouraged  many  of  them  to \nparticipate in the development work \nLengthy internal Government procedures contributed to delays in project start up, \nparticularly in regard to recruiting consultants and procuring equipment. \n\n                                                 \n3 The specific lessons learned were drawn from the respective project completion reports. While the reports for RDP-\n1 and -2 have been published, the report for RIDP-3 is under preparation. RIIP-1 is still under implementation.  \n4  ADB.  1999.

Responses to Lessons Learned \n \n6. \nIn the course of packaging its development assistance to the rural infrastructure sector, \nADB has endeavored to work with LGED and other agencies concerned to carry out most of the \nrecommendations implied in the lessons above. Among the relevant steps taken by LGED and \nother agencies concerned are the following: \n\nto  project  planning  and \n\nthe  participatory  approach \n\nEstablishing a number of soil laboratories in LGED regional offices has enabled \nadequate soil and material testing prior to actual construction. \nTraining  contractors  on  contract  management  and  financial  management  has \nbeen incorporated in every subproject. \nLGED  has  adopted \nimplementation as a  standard practice. \nLCSs  have  been  engaged  to  maintain  rural  roads,  plant  trees  along  them,  and \nmaintain the trees. \nGovernment processing of documents such as the development project proposal \n(formerly called the project proforma) has been advanced to secure counterpart \nfinancing for projects on a timely basis.    \nGender and development principles have been institutionalized in LGED. This is \nmanifested in LGED\u2019s development of gender-sensitive designs for rural markets \nand  union  council  complexes,  in  which  separate  sanitary  facilities  are  provided \nfor  men  and  women.  LGED  has  also  mandated  that  contractors  pay  men  and \nwomen  laborers  equally  for  equal  work.  At  growth  center  markets,  specialized \nsections  averaging  12  stalls  per  market  have  been  set  aside  exclusively  for \nwomen. \nPoverty  reduction  measures  in  project  design  include  the  direct  employment  of \npoor unskilled workers from the immediate vicinity of the project and training local \nyouths of both sexes on livelihood projects, handicrafts, and future employment \nopportunities. \n\n \n7. \nTo prepare local government units to assume greater responsibility in governance, rural \ninfrastructure projects implemented after RIDP-2 invariably include provisions for enhancing the \nphysical facilities of LGIs, as well as training for members and officials of union councils on their \nresponsibilities,  financial  management,  participatory  approaches  to  project  planning  and \nimplementation, and poor people\u2019s participation in local decision making. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9          37 \n\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n\nConsultants for Project Design, Supervision, and Management \n\nA. \n \nA  team  of  consultants  will  be  employed  to  assist  the  Local  Government  Engineering \n1. \nDepartment (LGED) in implementing the Second Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (the \nProject).

The national strategy for poverty reduction in Bangladesh gives high \npriority  to  developing  roads  and  related  infrastructure.  The  Second  Rural  Infrastructure \nImprovement  Project  (the  Project)  directly  addresses  the  problem  associated  with  the  lack  of \nconnectivity between the rural areas where most people live and the areas that offer economic \nopportunities to the rural poor. \n\nB. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n2. \nThe  project  benefits  will  be  generated  from  (i)  the  directly  quantifiable  benefits  arising \nfrom savings in vehicle operating costs, discussed in part C below, and (ii) the indirect benefits \nthat  are  not  quantified  in  the  economic  evaluation  but  are  likely  to  be  quite  significant.  These \nbenefits are discussed below. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nImproved Access and Reduced Poverty \n\n3. \n Like  many  rural  areas  in  Bangladesh,  the  project  area  suffers  from  general  isolation.  \nAreas  of  agricultural  production  have  no  year-round  access  to  either  markets  or  sources  of \ntechnical services. Bringing produce to an existing paved road typically takes hours of travel on \nfoot  or  by  bullock  cart.  Visits  by  agricultural  extension  services  are  few  and  far  between.  \nWomen  and  children  in  particular  suffer  from  the  lack  of  access  to  health  and  education \nservices, which are reliably available only in larger towns. Although some available rural labor \nmay  be  willing  to  undertake  off-farm  activities,  the  lack  of  access  to  alternative  employment \nprevents  them  from  engaging  in  any  such  gainful  jobs.  Largely  due  to  the  lack  of  access  to \neconomic opportunities, the project area suffers from a high incidence of poverty (about 55% of \nrural population in 2000, the latest year for which data exists) and child labor. With the Project, \nthe level of poverty is expected to drop by 7%, with child labor declining considerably. \n\n4. \nThe Project aims to improve the network of rural roads, rural markets, and union council \noffices  in  23  districts  of  Bangladesh.  These  physical  works  will  link  the  rural  population  and \nagricultural  production  areas  with  places  offering  broader  economic  and  social  opportunities. \nThe economic opportunities have the following dimensions: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRural labor will become more mobile and able to combine farm employment with \noff-farm work in nearby urban communities. \nAgricultural producers  will  become more  market  oriented  and  adjust  agricultural \nproduction decisions in line with the goal of maximizing profits. \nGreater  access  for  poor  children  to  education,  and  of  poor  youths  to  skills-\ndevelopment programs, will build the foundation for forming a skilled labor force \nwith long-term benefits for the economy and labor market. \nSocial  services,  such  as  education  and  healthcare,  and  technical services  such \nas  agricultural  extension  and  access  to  new  technology  (including  high-yielding \nseed varieties and fertilizers) will be more easily available.  \n\n(v)  With  improved  market  facilities,  fresh  produce  will  be  more  readily  available  at \nmarket centers with minimal spoilage. The expanding economic opportunities will \nhelp in sustaining poverty-reduction efforts in the project area. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10          41 \n\n2. \n\nLocal Governance Improvement \n\n \n \n5. \nThe  improvement  of  local  governance  under  the  Project  will  be  achieved  by  (i) \nempowering  women  and  (ii)  giving  greater  responsibility  to  the  local  government  units  (union \ncouncils,  or  UCs)  and,  through  them,  to  the  people.  The  empowerment  of  women  will  be \nattained  by  first  providing  them  needed  skills  (e.g.,  in  management  and  retail  trade)  and  then \ngiving them the opportunity to apply those skills (e.g., in managing their own shops in the rural \nmarkets). Apart from this, women members of UCs will be trained in development planning and \nfinancial  management  to  make  them  better  able  to  contribute  to  decision-making  in  UCs, \nparticularly on issues involving women. Women will also be given training on income-generating \nactivities to expand their opportunities to earn family income. This assistance to women in the \nproject area, along with the requirement that contractors pay equal wages to men and women \nfor the same work value, will gradually narrow the gender gap in Bangladesh. \n\nthe  decentralization  of \n\nin  participatory  governance  and \n\nStrengthening the capacity of UCs will, in the long run, prepare them to assume broader \n6. \nresponsibilities \nfinancial  and \nadministrative authority. Under the Project, following a series of training programs for members \nand officers of UCs, they will be tasked with preparing proposals for improving village roads in \ntheir  respective  jurisdictions.  Funds  will  be  made  available  under  the  Project  for  this  purpose.  \nUCs that perform well in implementing their first village road will be entitled to additional funds to \nimprove more village roads. The performance-based incentive will be institutionalized under the \nProject to encourage UCs to improve the quality of their work. Emulating best practices will be \nencouraged  by  inviting  neighboring  UCs  to  visit  and  learn  from  each  other.  On  the  whole,  the \nimprovement  in  local  governance  under  the  Project  will  enhance  its  pro-poor  focus.  The \nstronger local government units, along with their clear ownership of the Project, will help ensure \nthe sustainability of project facilities. \n\n3. \n\nOther Benefits \n\n \n \n7. \nApart  from  the  benefits  from  the  rural  roads  and  markets,  the  Project  will  contribute  to \nthe  general  well-being  of  rural  populations  in  various  ways.  Providing  submersible  roads  will \nreduce the travel time during the dry season in low-lying areas. Constructing jetties will facilitate \nthe  safe  loading  and  unloading  of  goods  and  passengers.  The  construction  of  flood  refuge \nshelters will save the lives and property of the rural people living in the flood-prone areas. The \nconstruction  of  UC  complexes  will  provide  one-stop  services  to  rural  people.  The  human \nresource development program proposed under various components of the Project will increase \nthe knowledge and skills of various population groups, particularly women. \n \nC. \n \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis of Rural Roads \n\n8. \n\nIn conducting an economic analysis of roads, the following steps were taken:  \n \n\na. \n\nAssessment of Road Condition, Existing Traffic, and Traffic Growth \n\n \n9. \nRoad  roughness  is  measured  by  the  international  roughness  index  in  meters  per \nkilometer (m/km). For economic analysis, the difference between earth and paved roads in their \nexisting  condition  has  been  taken  into  account.  For  bitumen-surfaced  roads,  the  international \nroughness  index  (IRI)  is  10  m/km;  on  herringbone  bond  roads,  the  IRI  is  14  m/km;  and  for \nearthen roads, 18 m/km. These IRI values were assumed under the \u201cwithout project\u201d condition \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42          Appendix 10 \n\nover the project period. For \u201cwith Project\u201d roads, an average lifetime IRI pf 4 m/km is assumed. \nAverage annual daily traffic was calculated considering the number of  market and non-market \ndays  in  a  year  and  adjusted  for  seasonal  changes.  Traffic  growth  is  assumed  to  be  6.50%  a \nyear, somewhat less than the national traffic growth rate of 7.34% per year.1 The existing traffic \nis assumed to represent traffic volume without the Project. Traffic volume with the Project was \nset  as  equivalent  to  the  existing  traffic  plus  generated  traffic,  the  latter  being  assumed  to  be \n50%  of  traffic  volume  without  project.  This  level  of  generated  traffic  is  considered  to  be \nconservative since additional traffic volume in recently completed projects similar to the Project \nhas ranged from about 70% to over 100%.2 \n \n\nb. \n\nEstimation of Costs  \n\nThe  economic  costs  of  rural  roads  under  the  Project  include  the  cost  of  upgrading \n10. \nexisting, generally earthen roads to bitumen-paved condition in line with LGED standards. The \ninvestment  cost,  annual  routine  cost  of  maintenance,  and  the  cost  of  periodic  maintenance \ncarried out every 5 years were included in the costs estimates. Physical contingencies, but not \nprice  escalation,  were  included  in  the  economic  costs.  The  financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic  costs  by  first  deducting  taxes  and  duties,  adding  physical  contingency  and \nmanagement costs, and then applying the standard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n \n\n   \n\nc. \n\nEstimation of Benefits \n\n \n11.  The  major  source  of  benefits  from  improving  rural  roads  is  savings  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts  (VOC)  over  the  smoother  road  surface  for  vehicles  of  all  types.  The  incremental  benefit \nincreases at the rate corresponding to the traffic growth rate of 6.5 percent. The normal benefit \n(i.e., the benefit accruing from the existing traffic due to VOC reduction) is estimated to be 40% \nof  the  total  benefits  in  the  third  year,  70%  in  the  fourth  year,  and  full  from  the  fifth  year. \nAdditional benefits that will be realized but not quantified in the present analyses are increased \nagricultural income arising from higher fertilizer use due to its lower delivered price, greater use \nof high-yielding crop varieties, and higher market prices for agricultural produce.  \n \n\n   \n\nd.  \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n\n \n12. \nThe  economic  analysis  takes  account  of  the  different  times  at  which  project  costs  are \nincurred and benefits accrue. For any given subproject, the costs are mainly incurred during the \nfirst 2\u20135 years, while benefits start to flow in the third year, as indicated above, and achieve their \nfull level by the fifth year of the Project. The period of analyses is set at 20 years. The economic \ncosts are compared with the economic benefits, and the net benefits are used to calculate the \nEIRR. \n \n \n\n2. \n \n13. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  three  core  subdistrict  roads  was  performed  using  the \nprocedures  discussed  above.  EIRR  analysis  found  all  three  roads  to  be  economically  viable. \nThe  Churkhi\u2013Dapunia  road  will  generate  the  highest  benefit,  followed  by  the  Tarakanda\u2013\nShyamgonj road. The Mominpur\u2013Keranirhat road will generate the least benefit among the three \nsample subdistrict roads but will still generate a rate of return of more than 12%. The results of \nalternative scenarios showed the changes in EIRR to be minimal.  \n\nResults of Economic Analysis of Roads \n\n                                                 \n1 Roads and Highways Department, Government of Bangladesh. 2003.

In  addition  to  GCMs  there  are  also  other  small  rural \nmarkets. Unimproved markets are congested, unhygienic, dusty in the dry season, and muddy \nin  the  wet  season.  Improved  markets  provide  clean,  uncongested,  and  efficient  places  for \ntrading  farm  and  other  products.  In  the  present  Project,  three  types  of  markets  will  be \ndeveloped:  (i)  GCMs  located  at  subdistrict  headquarters,  (ii)  GCMs  not  located  at  subdistrict \nheadquarters, and (iii) small rural markets not designated as GCMs. Due to population growth \nand  the  increased  trading  of  farm  and  other  goods  in  the  rural  areas,  demand  for  the  third \ncategory of local markets has increased.  \n \n \n\nMethodology of Economic Analysis  \n\nb. \n\n15. \n\n \n \nEconomic analysis of GCMs was as followed: \n \n\ni. \n\nEstimating the Costs \n\n \n16. \nThe  economic  costs  of  GCMs  under  the  Project  include  the  cost  of  construction, \nincluding  of  women\u2019s  market  section.  Along  with  the  investment  cost,  operation  and \nmaintenance  costs  were  included  in  the  estimates.  Physical  contingencies,  but  not  price \nescalation,  were  included  in  the  economic  costs.  The  financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic  costs  by  first  deducting  taxes  and  duties,  adding  physical  contingency  and \nmanagement costs, and then applying the standard conversion factor of 0.80.  \n\n \n \n   \n\n \n\nii. \n\nEstimation of Benefits \n\n \n17. \nA  spoilage  savings  approach  was  used  to  quantify  benefits.  Spoilage  savings  are  the \nportion of revenue lost to the seller as a result of product quality deterioration. The benefit is the \ndifference  in  spoilage  savings  of  perishable  goods  in  the  market  with  and  without  the  Project \nand calculated on the basis of number of peak and off-peak days in a year. It is assumed that \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44          Appendix 10 \n\nspoilage  will  reduce  by  60%  with  the  Project.3  The  remaining  40%  of  the  benefits  will  accrue \nfrom population growth and improved transport facilities. Benefits are expected to be generated \nfrom  the  second  year  of  the  improvement  on  the  markets,  with  benefits  increasing  at  a \ncompounded rate of 8% per year. \n \n \n \n18. \nThe  results  of  the  economic  analysis  of  the  core  subproject  GCM,  GCMs  located  at \nsubdistrict  headquarters,  and  GCMs  located  outside  of subdistrict  headquarters  are  discussed \nbelow. \n \n\nResults of Economic Analysis  \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni. \n\nThe Core Subproject Growth Center Market \n\n \n19. \nOne  GCM\u2014Mominpur,  located  at  Rangpur  Sadar\u2014was  selected  to  illustrate  the \nprocedure for economic analysis. A market survey was conducted at this site, annual spoilage \nsavings  calculated,  and  benefits  estimated,  yielding  an  EIRR  of  17.87%.  This  is  quite \nsatisfactory  and  justifies  investments  in  this  component  of  the  Project.  Sensitivity  analysis \nshowed  that,  if  maintenance  cost  was  doubled,  the  EIRR  decreased  to  12.57%.  If  averted \nspoilage was reduced to 45% from the assumed 60%, the EIRR fell to 12.08.    \n \n\nTable A10.2: Results of Economic Analysis of 10 GCMs Located at Subdistrict \nHeadquarters \n\n \n\nName of the Market \n\nSubdistrict \n\nDistrict \n 1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty \nanalysis? \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Bangladesh:  \n \nPoverty is widespread in Bangladesh. As mentioned in the draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), improved \ninfrastructure is critical to poverty reduction, as physical infrastructure services enhance the capabilities of the poor and help \nthem avail themselves of the economic opportunities of growth. Constructing and improving roads, growth center markets \n(GCMs), and jetties\u2014and improving their operation and maintenance\u2014play important roles in reducing rural poverty by \ncreating new employment opportunities for poor men and women and so enhancing incomes for the poor, facilitating quick \nand cost-effective transportation of perishable agricultural commodities to urban markets, and enabling the easy availability \nof agricultural inputs at reasonable prices. Improved Union Council complexes (UCCs) are expected to bring central \nGovernment services closer to the people. The Project will help reduce poverty by creating sustainable seasonal and long-\nterm employment opportunities for the poor. Paved roads will encourage the start of bus and truck services in which the poor \nwill find employment as drivers, conductors, and helpers. Some new employment will also be created in non-motorized \ntransport. The improved growth centers and small markets along the improved roads are expected to serve landless and \nmarginal farmers by making daily necessities available to those who have earned wages. The Project will benefit other \nsegments of the population, including small traders. Infrastructure construction and improvement undertaken by the Project \nwill directly generate about 52,830 person-years of employment for the poor, 30% of them for women.  \n \nB.      Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe overall objective of the Project is poverty reduction. The impact of the Project on poverty will be measured using some \neconomic and social indicators: (i) changes in household well-being (income, consumption expenditure, and household \nassets); (ii) changes in work, employment, and wages (type of work, employment, job turnover, and average daily wage); (iii) \nchanges in production (crops, small business, prices, etc.); (iv) changes in social structure, status, and behavior (family size, \noccupation of household head, mobility, migration, and community activity); and (v) changes in health and educational \noutcomes. The benchmark poverty situation will be assessed with a baseline survey before the Project begins. Follow-up \nsurveys will be carried out for comparison with the benchmark situation.   \n \nAlthough in decline, the incidence of poverty is still very high in Bangladesh. According to the household income and \nexpenditure survey of 2000, about 50% of the population in the countryside live below the upper poverty line, and 34% live \nbelow the lower poverty line. Both measures are higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The incidence of poverty nationally \ndeclined by about 1% annually in the 1990s; further declines of the same magnitude were reported from 1999 to 2004. The \ndistribution of poverty by division, as estimated by both the measures using head-counts, shows Rajshahi Division with the \nhighest poverty incidence, followed by Khulna and Dhaka. The incidence of poverty was lowest in Barisal and Chittagong.   \n \nAnalyses of poverty in the project districts shows the highest incidence in the districts in Rajshahi Division. Compared with \nthe national average of 34% in 2000, more than 38% of the people in these districts were found to live below the lower \npoverty line. In the districts of Gaibandha and Kurigram, the rate was even higher, at more than 40%. Factors responsible for \nhigh poverty in these areas are (i) sandy soils, as substantial areas of Gaibandha and Kurigram are char (accreted) land, \nwhere about 2 million people live; (ii) low crop yields and limited scope for double or triple cropping; (iii) slow adoption of \ntechnology due to low literacy; (iv) seasonal joblessness with limited off-farm activities; (v) excessive flooding and river bank \nerosion; and (vi) limited infrastructure.  \n \nThe incidence of poverty is also high in several districts of Dhaka Division, particularly Netrokona, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, \nSherpur, and Kishoregonj, where 32% to 38% of the people live below the lower poverty line (Bangladesh Planning \nCommission and World Food Program). The districts bordering India (Sherpur, Jamalpur, Mymensingh, and Netrokona) are \nfrequently affected by flash floods.  Moreover, a sizable area of Netrokona and Kishoregonj districts are located in haor \n(perennial wetland) areas, which remain under water for about 8 months and allow only one crop to be grown. These areas \nmay also be affected by early floods. Except three urbanized districts\u2014Dhaka, Narayanganj, and Gazipur, where the \nincidence of poverty is less than 20%\u2014the poverty in other districts is moderate, at 20\u201330%. The low incidence of poverty in \nthe urbanized districts is due to relatively good infrastructure and other facilities. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11          47\n\nThe Project will create substantial economic opportunities for the rural poor, who will get employment opportunities in \ninfrastructure construction and maintenance. A total of 52,830 person-years of employment opportunities will be created for \nunskilled laborers, of which 30% will be women. \n \nRoad networks will create employment for many poor people, including transport workers (operators, drivers, and helpers), \nancillary support and service providers, and small traders. When roads are improved, vehicle operating costs for motorized \nand other vehicles will decline. The operators are poor, especially those of non-motorized vehicles. Their journeys will \nbecome more frequent, enhancing their income. \n \nThe general population, particularly women and children, will have better access to social service facilities and institutions \nincluding education, healthcare, microfinance and small enterprises. Travel time will shorten. With improved transport \nfacilities, farm gate prices for agricultural commodities will increase, and farmers will be able to get agricultural inputs at \nreasonable prices. Environmental conditions in GCM areas will significantly improve. Microfinance agencies, including \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), will be encouraged to expand their credit and other income-generating activities in the \nproject areas. This will benefit the poor immensely. \n \nC.      Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n \n\u22a0 Yes  \u25a1 No \n\n \n\u22a0 Yes  \u25a1 No \n\nA stakeholder analysis was conducted through a series of regional and union-level workshops, as well as through focus \ngroup discussions with groups of stakeholders at three core subproject sites. The consultations helped to identify both the \nsupply side (service providers) and demand side (beneficiaries) stakeholders. The former group includes funding agencies; \nLocal Government Engineering Department (LGED) staff; administrative staff; government workers in different departments \nat the district, subdistrict, and union level; NGOs and community-based organizations; and contractors and local government \nofficials. The demand group includes farmers, retail traders and businessmen, small entrepreneurs, wholesale traders, \nwoman traders, poor and vulnerable women, rickshaw pullers and van drivers, transport owners, school and college \nteachers, and students. The proposed participation strategy includes  \n\n(i)  mobilizing community groups concerned, including women, through extensive campaigns about the project \n\ncomponents and the accruable benefits, as well as their roles and responsibilities, so that they can develop a sense \nof ownership toward the project;  \n\n(ii)  provisions to build the capacity of officers and members of local government units on participatory approaches and \n\nparticipatory supervision and monitoring of project activities; \n\n(iii)  provision for women\u2019s representation in all project management committees; \n(iv)  provision of appropriate facilities for women in union council (UC) complexes that will facilitate their participation in \n\nlocal governance; \n\nplanting, and tree maintenance; \n\n(v)  arrangements for poor women, through labor contracting societies (LCSs) to participate in road maintenance, tree \n\n(vi)  provision of training LCS members on income-generating skills; \n(vii)  instituting and strengthening the participatory skills and capabilities of the staff members of LGED, the Executing \n\nAgency, by imparting training on participatory tools and techniques, so that they can effectively promote and guide \nparticipatory practices under the Project; and \n\n(viii) provision for developing a sustainable monitoring and evaluation mechanism in LGED to periodically assess the \n\nimpact of the Project on the livelihood of the targeted poor community members.     \n\nD.      Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n\nThe major infrastructure developed under the Project will empower women. Constructing rural roads will improve the mobility \nof women and benefit them as users of markets, UCCs and roads. Short-term and seasonal employment in improving and \nmaintaining infrastructure will be created. Employment generation for women will take place in women market sections, in \nopen sheds of GCMs, and in construction work as laborers. The extensive participation of poor women under the Project is \nlargely in line with the national policy of the Government in reducing poverty highlighted in the PRSP. The Project will \npromote the effective participation of women in governance and facilitate strengthening the role of female UC members by \nproviding training and capacity building to plan and coordinate different activities. The Project will help female UC members \nbecome involved in development activities and union development coordination committees, as they will receive training to \nbetter understand their roles and responsibilities. The Project will continue to mainstream gender issues in LGED. \nHas an output been prepared?                        \u22a0 Yes          \u25a1  No  \n \nA detailed gender action plan has been prepared. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48          Appendix 11 \n\nE.

One \nfull and two short \nresettlement plans have \nbeen prepared to guide \nthe preparation and \nimplementation of \nresettlement plans for all \nthe subprojects. If there \nis impact on the \nindigenous population, \nindigenous peoples \naction will be \nrecommended in the \nresettlement plans.  \n\nA resettlement impact assessment has been carried in three \ncore subprojects of Project based on surveys and \nconsultation with affected people. About 0.8 ha land per \nkilometer of road will be needed for road improvement. \nSome structures will need partial or full relocation, and some \ntrees must be felled. Narrow strips of additional land required \non both the sides of existing roads will touch many plots, but \nthe impact on the individual households will be minimum \n(less than 10% of the households income). Impacts on \nindigenous people is unlikely. The growth centers and the \nUC complexes will be built on land already donated or \nacquired, while the improvement of subdistrict roads will be \ncarried out on acquired land. As a result, the Project will \ninvolve both voluntary and involuntary resettlement. \n \n1. Subproject resettlement impacts should be assessed \n\nthrough surveys and consultation, and negative impacts \nminimized by all possible measures. \n\n2. If required, short and full resettlement plans will be \n\nprepared to mitigate impacts, with special emphasis on \nwomen and vulnerable people, so that no one will be \nworse off. \n\n3. Timely implementation of resettlement plans will be \n\ncarried out through appropriate organizational, \ninstitutional, and financial arrangements. \n\n4. Internal and independent monitoring and evaluation will \nbe maintained to monitor the progress and impact of the \nProject. \n\nThe Project will improve access to goods and services for \nthe poor or otherwise vulnerable groups because it will \nimprove their opportunities for income-generation. \nImproved infrastructure will lower transportation costs, \nincreasing mobility.  In addition, UCs will be able to \nimprove their GCMs, UC complexes, and jetties by \ncontributing only 10% of the total cost. \nNo adverse impact is anticipated. During implementation, \npoor men and women will get employment. After \nimplementation, women will get jobs maintaining roads, \nplanting trees and caring for the trees. A substantial \nnumber of jobs will be created in other off-farm activities. \nNo indigenous people live on the roadsides of the core \nsubproject area. \n \nThe Project will ensure that, if indigenous people live in the \nother subproject areas, they will be properly identified. As \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are unlikely to be \nsignificant, addressing any impacts on them will be \nintegrated in the resettlement plan. \nThere can be obstruction in the movement of country boats \nunder the bridges to be built on the navigable canals due to \nlack of free port. \n \nCattle will not be allowed on the improved roads, so some \npeople who grazing cattle on the roadside will be affected. \n \nThe increased mobility may encourage the harmful \nmigration of men, women, and children. \n\n \n\n\u25a1 Yes \n\u22a0 No \n\n \n \n\u25a1 Yes \n\u22a0 No \n\n \n\u25a1 Yes \n\u22a0 No \n\n \n \n\u25a1 Yes \n\u22a0 No \n\nAffordability  \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n\u25a1 Significant \n\u22a0 Not Significant  \n\u25a1 None \n \n\n\u25a1 Significant \n\u22a0 Not Significant  \n\u25a1 None \n\n\u25a1 Significant \n\u25a1 Not Significant \n\u22a0 Uncertain \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n \n \n          \n\n\u25a1 Significant \n\u22a0 Not Significant  \n\u25a1 None \n\n\fAppendix 12          49           \n\nRESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nIntroduction \n\nResettlement Framework \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  resettlement  framework  provides  the  basis  for  preparing  resettlement  plans  for \n1. \nspecific  subprojects  as  may  be  required  under  the  Second  Rural  Infrastructure  Improvement \nProject  (the  Project).  It  identifies  the  broad  scope  of  the  Project  and  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures, and institutional requirements for formulating resettlement plans for subprojects. As \nthe Executing Agency for the Project, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is \nresponsible  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  resettlement  plans  in  line  with  the  resettlement \nframework. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  in  Bangladesh  is  the  Acquisition  and \nRequisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  1982  and  subsequent  amendments.  The  1982 \nordinance  recognizes  only  the  legal  owners  of  land  and  property  but  does  not  cover  project-\naffected people without formal title, such as squatters, occupiers, and informal tenants and lease-\nholders without registered deeds. The law also does not ensure compensating the replacement \nvalue of the property acquired. \n \n3. \nIn  the  absence  of  a  national  resettlement  policy  in  Bangladesh,  the  Government  has \nadopted  the  policy  of  funding  agencies  on  involuntary  resettlement.  This  ensures  that  people \naffected  by  land  acquisition  will  be  eligible  for  appropriate  compensation  and  resettlement \nbenefits. People with no legal title who lose land to the project will be provided with compensation \nand resettlement benefits. Customary rights to land and physical property will also be recognized, \nincluding leases on homestead, commercial and agricultural land, sharecroppers, and renters of \nland and structures.  \n \n4. \nThe  framework  bridges  the  gaps  between  Government  and  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  policies  and  endorses  an  income-restoration  strategy  for  vulnerable  affected  people, \nincluding squatters, irrespective of legal title to the affected property. \n \n\nTable A12: Measures for Compliance with ADB Policy and Government Laws \n\nAssessment \n\nLoss of land/ \nstructure/tree/ crops/ \nincome and the \nowners \n\nValuation of affected \nproperty \n\n1982 Land Acquisition Act and Subsequent \nAmendments (Government Policy) \nLoss of land, structure, tree/crop is assessed \nand the title holders are identified as per legal \nprovisions of law and through joint \nverification.a \n\nCompensation as per sale value of land \nrecorded in the sub-registrars' office and rate \nfixed by Public Works Departmentc for \nstructures and by Department of Forests and \nDepartment of Agricultural Extension for \ntrees/crops, with a 50% premium in all cases.  \n\nAsian Development Bank Policy \n\nLoss of land, structure, tree/crop, and \nincome of the title and non-title holders \nare identified by socioeconomic survey \nand verified by a joint verification team \n(JVT).b \nReplacement value at current market \nprice is recommended by the project-\nspecific VAT.d Non-asset losses (viz. \nincome and dislocation) are also \nassessed, and restoration supports are \nprovided. \n\nJVT = joint verification team, VAT = valuation advisory team. \na Joint verification of affected property by acquiring and requiring bodies. \nb Joint verification team formed by the Ministry of LGRD. \nc Public Works Department maintains updated rates of different structure items.  \nd Project-specific property valuation advisory team is formed by the line Ministry. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\f50          Appendix 12 \n\nPreparation and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n\nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  of  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \n5. \nconsultation with the affected people and other stakeholders. All efforts will be made to minimize \ndisplacement  during  subproject  planning  and  implementation,  and  the  preferences  of  affected \npeople will be taken into account. An entitlement matrix (Supplementary Appendix Y), prepared \non the basis of potential resettlement impacts at three core subprojects, identifies the categories \nof impact based on surveys carried out on the tentative right of way and shows the entitlements \nfor  each  type  of  loss.  If  new  impacts  are  subsequently  identified  during  detailed  design,  these \nlosses  will  be  included  in  the  entitlement  matrix,  and  the  resettlement  plan  will  be  appropriately \nrevised.  \n \nC. \n \nResettlement plans for selected subprojects will be prepared and implemented as needed. \n6. \nThe  resettlement  plans  will  be  reviewed  by  LGED  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence.  If  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  identified  in  any  of  the  subproject  areas,  the \nresettlement plan for the subproject will include special action for affected indigenous people. The \nresettlement plan prepared for the sample subproject will be used as a model for the preparation \nof  subsequent  resettlement  plans.  Resettlement  plans  must  comply  with  ADB  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  other  social  safeguard  policies,  including  consultation  with  the \npeople  affected,  which  will  provide  local  insights  for  establishing  safety  net  mechanisms. \nPreparation of a resettlement plan involves the following procedures: (i) collecting socioeconomic \ninformation, (ii) valuating affected property, (iii) assessing gender impacts, (iv) disclosing the plan \nto  stakeholders,  (v)  redressing  grievances  if  any,  and  (vi)  paying  actual  compensation.  These \nprocedures are described below. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCollection of Socioeconomic Data \n\n7. \nWith  the  help  of  the  resettlement  specialist,  LGED  will  undertake  social  surveys  of  \nsubproject areas, including a full census of the households and physical establishments requiring \nrelocation.  An  agricultural  land  survey  will  study  a  20%  sample  of  plots,  and  a  detailed \nsocioeconomic survey of 20% of the households and other establishments to be relocated will be \ncarried out. The socioeconomic survey will establish baseline information on household incomes, \noccupational  and  livelihood  patterns,  resettlement  needs  and  responses,  social  organization, \ncommunity  organization,  and  cultural  parameters  in  the  subproject  area.  LGED  will  ensure  that \nappropriate  entitlements  and  mitigation  measure  are  established  in  the  resettlement  plans  in \naccordance  with  the  resettlement  framework.  If  the  impact  is  significant\u2014i.e.,  the  number  of \npeople  physically  displaced  or  losing  10%  or  more  of  their  income  is  200  or  more\u2014a  full \nresettlement plan will be prepared. If the impact is insignificant, affecting fewer than 200 people, a \nshort  resettlement  plan  will  be  sufficient.  If  no  involuntary  resettlement  effects  are  foreseen,  no \nresettlement plan will be prepared.1  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nValuation of Property \n\n8. \nLosses and impacts on affected people due to land acquisition and involuntary relocation \nwill be assessed by LGED through a resettlement survey covering titled and non-titled owners of \nthe  affected  property,  including  their  loss  of  income  and  employment.  Affected  property  will  be \nquantified through joint verification carried out by the acquiring and requiring parties, and the date \nof  verification  will  be  considered  the  cut  off  date  for  physical  losses  eligible  for  compensation \nunder  law.

Since legal ownership of land does not reflect gender compliance \nin  case  of  spouses,  sufficient  measures  should  be  included  in  the  resettlement  plans  to  ensure \nspouses rights and social safety. The measures should (i) identify the socioeconomic condition, \nneeds,  and  priorities  of  women  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the  impact  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement on women separately; (ii) identify female-headed households to be affected and set \nentitlement criteria to recognize them; (iii) provide resources in kind (land, structures, etc.) in the \nname  of  both  spouses  of  the  households  to  be  affected;  and  (iv)  involve  women's  groups  in \nresettlement planning, management, and operations and in job creation and income generation.  \n\n4. \n\nDisclosing and Consultation    \n\n10. \nThe  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders. The resettlement framework will be made available in Bangla for affected people in \nthe planning phase, so that their views on the Project, its resettlement impact, and the mitigation \nmeasures  are  known  to  the  planners  and  incorporated  into  the  planning  documents.  The \nresettlement plans will be translated into Bangla and disclosed to affected people at the start of \nresettlement implementation. Affected people (including the women and vulnerable groups), local \ngovernment, and civil society representatives will participate in assessing the resettlement impact \nand mitigating measures.  \n\n5. \n\nGrievance Redress \n\n11. \nPrimary responsibility for addressing grievances rests with LGED. In the event that LGED \nis  unable  to  resolve  a  complaint,  it  might  be  referred  to  the  grievance  redress  committee \nestablished  for  each  subproject,  with  representatives  from  LGED,  affected  people,  women  and \nlocal  government  and  nongovernment  organizations.  A  contractor \nvulnerable  groups, \nrepresentative  should  attend  hearings  of  the  grievance  redress  committee.  The  resettlement \nofficer or his nominee will chair the grievance redress committee. Other than disputes related to \nownership  rights,  the  committee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits, \nrelocation,  and  relevant  assistance.  Grievances  will  be  redressed  within  2\u20134  weeks  from  the \ncomplaint being lodged.  \n\n \n\n6. \n\nCompensation \n\nthe  sub-registrars.  District  LGED \n\nFor  the  purpose  of  compensating  affected  persons,  LGED  will  prepare  land  acquisition \n12. \nproposals with the help of consultants and submit them to the respective deputy commissioners \nfor processing. The market price from the sub-registrar's office will be collected in a pre-designed \nformat  certified  by \nrepresentatives  will  accompany \nrepresentatives  from  the  consultants  in  the  joint  verification  and  price  fixing  process  led  by  the \ndeputy  commissioner.  With  representatives  from  LGED  and  the  deputy  commissioners,  PVATs \nwill determine the replacement market price of land, structures, and trees and will recommend the \nreplacement price for approval by LGED. The recommendation will ensure the replacement price \nof  land  and  property  at  current  market  value.  The  resettlement  framework  includes  an  income-\nrestoration strategy for vulnerable affected people, including squatters, irrespective of their legal \ntitle  to  affected  property.  People  involuntarily  separated  from  their  homes,  assets,  or  income \nsources, as well as non-titled people affected by the Project, will receive a subsistence allowance \nand priority access to income-generating programs.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52          Appendix 12 \n\nthrough \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nif  needed,  which  will  be  disbursed \n\nD. \n \n13. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  budget  includes  the  costs  of  acquiring  assets \nassociated  with  involuntary  resettlement.

The \nresettlement specialist will provide technical support to LGED and supervise and review the field \nactivities.  Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  from  the  first  year  of  the  Project  through  its  fifth \nyear. \n\nImplementing the Resettlement Plans \n\nfor  overall  coordination,  planning, \n\nimplementation,  and \n\nfinancing  of \n\n15. \nThe  deputy  commissioner  has  the  power  to  acquire  land  and  assess  compensation  of \nproperties thus acquired. The deputy commissioner acquires the land through the officer or staff \nof  the  land  acquisition  office.  Along  with  LGED,  the  land  acquisition  officer  will  conduct  joint \nphysical verification of property in accordance with the approved land acquisition proposal to be \nsubmitted  by  LGED  as  soon  as  the  detailed  design  and  alignments  for  the  subprojects  are \nfinalized. The deputy commissioner offices are responsible for the entire acquisition process, from \nnotification to affected people to awarding of compensation to owners of properties and payments \nof  compensation.  LGED  will  liaise  with  the  deputy  commissioner  offices  concerned  to  complete \nthe land acquisition process in a timely fashion.  \n \nF. \n \n16. \nAs  a  part  of  its  overall  monitoring  system,  the  PMO  will  monitor  the  progress  of  land \nacquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.

This gender action plan will equally promote the \nparticipation  of  men  and  women  stakeholders  as  change  agents  and  as  beneficiaries  in  the \nproject\u2019s development process with particular attention to (a) women\u2019s poverty reduction and (b) \nwomen\u2019s empowerment to participate in decision making and in public life.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  infrastructure  activities,  as  users,  as \nconstruction  labor  and  in  management  and  maintenance  of  infrastructures.  It  will  promote \nequality in wage for women and men for equal work. Women\u2019s equal participation in public life, \nin  social  and  environmental  management  and  in  local  governance  will  also  be  promoted  with \ngreater attention. The GAP attempts to ensure participation of women citizens, adolescent girls, \nstaff of the project, and elected women representatives in project activities at relevant levels. It \nalso  provides  women  to  equally  access  to  resources  and  services,  derive  benefits  from  the \nproject  services  as  well  as  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  community.  A  summary  of \nGender Action Plan is given below: \n \n3. \n \n\nSpecifically, in the Project, the gender issues will be addressed in the following manner: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIn  each  grown  center  market  (GCM)  space  will  be  allocated  for  construction  of \nwomen  market  section (WMS)  where  the  female  traders  will  run  their  business. \nThey will be supported to collect and store the homestead products in the WMS \nfor sale. \nFor the destitute and vulnerable women 15% space at the improved platform will \nbe earmarked for selling their products.  \nEmployment  of  poor  women  especially  the  project  affected  women  will  be \nensured  in  construction  works  through  labor  contracting  society  (LCS)  and \ncontractors. \nThe  poor  women  will  be  employed  in  road  maintenance  and  tree  plantation \nactivities. \nAs  a  part  of  institutional  capacity  building,  the  women  shop  owners  will  be \nencouraged  to  form  an  association  namely  Female  Shop  Owners  Association \n(FSOA)  so  that  they  can  be  represented  in  the  Traders\u2019  Association  (TA)  and \nMarket Management Committee (MMC). This association will also help women to \nbe represented in the forums related to women\u2019s business and entrepreneurship. \nThe  project  will  organize  skill  development  training,  create  scope  for  wider \nparticipation  in  trading  for  potential  shop  owners,  facilitate  to  establish  linkages \nwith different credit-providing agencies. \nThe  project  will  ensure  elimination  of  wage  differences  between  men  and \nwomen, aiming at the equal working opportunities.  \n\n(vii)  Micro-financing  agencies \n\nlike  Palli  Karma  Shahayak  Foundation  (PKSF), \nBangladesh  Rural  Development  Board  (BRDB),  Bangladesh  Krishi  Bank  (BKB) \nand other commercial banks and NGOs will be encouraged to extend their credit \n\n                                                 \n1   The  GAP  (2006-2011)  for  the  Project  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  development \npartners, in particular DFID. The detailed actions of the GAP are provided in Supplementary Appendix F, that will \nbe made available upon request. \n\n \n\n\f54          Appendix 13 \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nprogram in the project areas to support the LCS members in income generating \nactivities and female shop owners. \nInstitutional  linkages  for  the  concerned  stakeholders  will  be  established  to \nsupport  women  in  various  issues.  These  institutions  include:  (a)  Department  of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs (DWA) (b) Department of Social Services (DSS) (c) Department \nof  Youth  Development  (DoYD)  (d)  Department  of  Agricultural  Extension  (DAE) \n(e)  Bangladesh  Rural  Development  Board  (BRDB)  (f)  Department  of  Livestock \n(DOL)  (g)  Department  of  Fisheries  (DF)  (h)  Department  of  Forestry  (DoF)  (i) \nDepartment  of  Health  and  Family  Planning  (DHFP)  (j)  Department  of  Public \nHealth Engineering (DPHE) (k) Department of Agriculture Marketing (DAM) and \ndifferent  non  government  organizations.  These  offices  will  be  encouraged  to \nextend their cooperation for women\u2019s access to extension, technologies, market \n(GAD),  good \npromotion,  credit,  environment,  gender  and  development \ngovernance, legal aid, social security and other services.  \nThe project will help promote and build the capacity of Union Council, especially \nof  the  female  members  so  that  they  are  able  to  plan,  coordinate  and  monitor \nsocial and gender related development activities at the project area and can play \nan  effective  role  assigned  through  the  various  government  circulars.  Programs \nwill be undertaken like conducting training, organizing rallies on different issues, \ninvolving  them  in  different  committees  including  the  construction  supervision \ncommittees  (CSC),  union  development  coordination  committees  (UDCC), \nbuilding  network  with  different  government,  non  government  organizations  and \nprivate sectors, organizing inter-school/ inter-union debate or essay competitions \netc. These will help in creating and raising awareness among the public. \nThe female union council members will be supported to establish linkage with the \nline  agencies  in  order  to  increase  poor  women\u2019s  access  to  different  extension \nprograms.  These  programs  may  include  demonstration  of  agricultural  products, \ntraining  and  extension  visits  for  new  innovation,  technology  on  agriculture, \npoultry,  livestock,  fishery,  food  processing,  seed  production,  mini  nursery \ndevelopment,  health  and  nutrition,  use  of  safe  water,  proper  sanitation,  family \nplanning  and  immunization.  The  concerned  agencies  will  be  encouraged  to \nprovide their services by using newly constructed UCCs. \nFemale  union  council  members  will  be  encouraged  to  facilitate  and  involve \nmothers in ensuring children\u2019s rights with emphasis on girl child, women\u2019s rights \nand family development issues in the community focusing on LCS members and \nother disadvantaged women groups. Female  UC members will also monitor the \nactivities  undertaken  by  union  council  for  holding  awareness  raising  rallies  and \nother related programs. \nAs per policy matrix under PRSP for achieving women\u2019s advancement and rights \nawareness raising campaigns will be organized for improving women\u2019s efficiency \nby reducing time use in household and reproductive roles. \n\n(xiii)  All  necessary  institutional  supports  will  be  provided  to  the  female  construction \nlaborers including resting shed for lactating women, water and sanitation facilities \nfor  all  female  laborers  and  female  shop  owners.  The  contractors  appointed  for \nconstruction will be informed before bidding the facilities to be ensured for female \nlaborers  and  shop  owners.  Failing  to  ensure  the  facilities  their  contracts  will  be \nterminated. \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13          55 \n\nComponent \n\nRural Roads \n\n\u2022  Ensure  consultation  with  women  for  participation  in  planning,  design  and \n\nActivity and Target \n\nimplementation; \n\nconstruction laborers; \n\n\u2022  Create  employment  opportunities  for  poor  women  by  engaging  them  as \n\n\u2022  Ensure women\u2019s participation in operation and maintenance of roads; \n\u2022  Promote wage parity of women and men for similar work; \n\u2022  Orient contractors to employ women laborers and pay equal wage for women \n\n\u2022 \n\nand men; \nForm  women  LCS  groups  and  engage  them  in  tree  plantation  and  routine \nmaintenance;; \nTrain  LCS  women  on  off-pavement  maintenance,  tree  plantation  and  care \ntaking,  leadership  development,  skill  development  on  some  trades  and \nprofitable income generating  activities. \n\u2022  Establish  women  market  sections \n\nin  growth  center  markets \n\n\u2022 \n\nfor   \n\naccommodating  women  traders  and  mainstreaming  rural  women  in  rural \neconomy; \n\n\u2022  Keep 15% space earmarked for women vendors in open sheds of GCM; \n\u2022  Provide  one  stop  services  to  rural  people  specially  women  by  providing \nfacilities at the UC complex to representatives of various ministries of GoB and \nNGOs; \n\n\u2022  Establish support services (separate toilets, waiting rooms etc.) for women in \n\njetties, flood refuge shelters and women market sections; \n\n\u2022  Establish network for female UC members and female shop owners for voicing \ntheir rights and participating in public life and  decision making processes; \n\u2022  Ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  Market  Management  Committee  (MMC)  and \n\nOperation and Maintenance (O & M)   committee of infrastructures; \n\n\u2022  Provide skills development and shop management training to the female shop \n\nowners through selected NGOs. \n \n\n\u2022  Organize  workshops/training \n\nfor  UC  members  on  preparing  budget, \n\nconducting meetings, accounts keeping, participating  in public life etc; \n\n\u2022  Ensure women\u2019s access to resources; \n\u2022  Organize rallies and meetings on different issues like health, family planning, \nsanitation,  CEDAW,  protection  against  dowry,  early  marriage,  acid  throwing, \nregistration of birth, marriage and death etc; \n\n\u2022  Encourage  adolescent  girls\u2019  participation  in  monthly  ward  level  meetings  in \n\n\u2022  Promote citizen\u2019s awareness including women and adolescent   girls on social \n\nUCC;  \n\nand gender related issues; \n\n\u2022  Ensure participation of female UC members in local governance. \n\u2022 \n\nThe  district  sociologist  will  be  assigned  on  a  permanent  basis  by  LGED  to \nassist the community organizers in implementing gender-related activities; \n\u2022  Build  capacity  of  LGED  personnel  by  organizing  different  in  country  \u2013  out \n\ncountry training/workshops; \n\n\u2022  A  GAD  specialist  will  be  engaged \n\nto  ensure  mainstreaming  and \n\nimplementation of gender \u2013 related activities and oversee training programs; \n\u2022  Conduct socio-economic studies to evaluate poverty reduction of women and \n\nparticipation of female UC members in local governance; \n\n\u2022  Establish gender based data and monitoring system; \n\u2022 \n\nInclude  female  UC  member  in  construction  supervision  committee  at  union \nlevel.  \n\nCEDAW  =  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  Against  Women,  GAD  =  gender  and \ndevelopment, GCM = growth center market, LCS = labor contracting society, LGED = Local Government Engineering \nDepartment,  MMC  =  market  management  committee,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance, UC = Union Council, UCC = UC Complex. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nRural Infrastructure \n\nLocal Governance and \nLGED Capacity Building \n\nSupport for Project \nManagement \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fArea of Focus \n\nObjectives \n\nActivities \n\nIndicators \n\nAction By \n\nACTION PLAN FOR IMPROVEMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNANCE  \n\n1.
