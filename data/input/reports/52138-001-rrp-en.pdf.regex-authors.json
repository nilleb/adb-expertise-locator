THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nsecured debt financing of up to $150,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) to Fullerton India Credit \nCompany Limited (FICC) for the Expanding Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Lending \nProject in India. \n \n2.  The debt financing will support the growth of FICC\u2019s financing portfolio for micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), providing needed financial products and services to this \nunderserved segment. At least 50% of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) facility will be for loans \nin lagging states.1 As a result of the ADB intervention, FICC will also implement a gender action \nplan (GAP) to expand its lending to women-led MSMEs in India. At least 60% of the ADB facility \nwill finance loans to women MSME borrowers.2 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. Based on the findings of the 2018 \nreport of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the MSME sector in India, the country \nhad an estimated 55.8 million (nonagricultural) MSMEs in fiscal year (FY) 2017, operating (top 5 \nindustries) in retail (46.0%), food products and beverages (6.0%), apparel (5.0%), motor vehicle \nrepair  (4.0%),  and  textiles  (3.0%).3  Predominately  unregistered,  94.9%  of  MSMEs  were \nmicroenterprises,  4.9% were  small  enterprises,  and  0.2%  were  medium-sized  enterprises.4 \nMSMEs accounted for about 31% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 45% of exports, and \nemployed more than 124 million people. Approximately 59.5% of MSMEs are located in rural \nareas and 40.5% are in urban areas. For MSMEs the lack of adequate access to finance is seen \nas a major obstacle to growth, with 84% of all MSMEs self-financing or using informal finance \nsources and only 16% of MSMEs accessing credit from formal financial institutions. The lack of \nreadily accessible finance is even more acute for women-led MSMEs. \n \n4.  Women in the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises sector. MSMEs owned by \nwomen accounted for 14.0%\u201320.4% of all MSMEs in FY2017.5 Based on a 2014 IFC study, \napproximately 78% of enterprises owned by women are in the services sector.6 For this and other \nreasons, women entrepreneurship is largely skewed toward smaller firms, with almost 98% of \nbusinesses owned by women categorized as microenterprises. Low levels of women-ownership \nof small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are common in many countries in the region. In \nSouth Asia, only 9% of SMEs are owned by women.7 Access to formal finance is one key barrier \n \n1  Government of India, Ministry of Finance. 2013. Report of the Committee for Evolving a Composite Development \nIndex of States. New Delhi. The report identified India\u2019s lagging states, low-income states with high poverty incidence, \nand special category states. These include Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya \nPradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, \nand West Bengal. \n2  The terms \u201cwomen-led\u201d and \u201cwomen MSME borrowers\u201d include women borrowers and co-borrowers. \n3  IFC. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nto the growth of women-owned businesses, leading to more than 90% of finance requirements \nbeing met through informal sources. The financing gap for women-owned MSMEs totaled \u20b96.37 \ntrillion or roughly 73% of total demand in FY2012. Women have more difficulties than men in \naccessing credit for a variety of reasons, including limited awareness and understanding of \nfinancial products because of their lack of financial education and unfamiliarity with formal banking \ninstitutions, lack of collateral to guarantee credit, difficulty in presenting their personal profiles and \ntrack records, the requirement for support from male family members for loan applications, and \nother discriminatory practices by loan officers (footnote 7). In recognition of the difficulties faced \nby MSMEs, particularly those owned by women, the Government of India has launched several \ninitiatives  designed  to  achieve  greater  participation  of  women  in  the  sector  and  enhance \nenterprise growth.8 \n \n5.  Rationale. Notwithstanding the size of the financial sector and the significant strides the \ngovernment is making in its financial inclusion strategy, access to finance in India remains a key \nissue, with fewer than 7% of adults accessing loans through formal channels.9 In rural areas, \naccess to finance is even more scarce, with only 5% of rural residents reporting having borrowed \nto start, operate, or expand a business (footnote 3). The 2018 IFC report on India\u2019s MSME sector \nidentified MSMEs\u2019 lack of adequate access to finance as the biggest challenge to further growth \nand underlies the reason why most micro and small enterprises do not graduate to become formal \njob-making SMEs (footnote 3). Banks have typically limited exposure to MSMEs because of a \nhigher risk perception and MSMEs\u2019 limited access to immovable collateral. Given the continued \nneed to address credit access issues and to support the government\u2019s financial inclusion efforts, \nADB has identified financial institution partners that have demonstrated the ability to reach \nunderbanked segments on a profitable and sustainable basis and support the development of \nIndia\u2019s  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  \u2013  SMEs  and  the  lower  middle-income  segment  \u2013  through  their \ninvolvement with MSMEs. One such institution is FICC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fullerton \nFinancial Holdings (FFH). Incorporated as a nonbank finance institution (NBFI) in India in 2005, \nFICC  targets  the  lower-income  and  emerging  middle-income  segments,  providing  MSME \nbusiness credit in rural and urban India. Over the past several years, FICC has become an \nimportant institution in the market, with total assets under management (AUM) of \u20b9194.7 billion \nas of the end of the first 9 months of FY2019 (9MFY2019). Present across 22 states and 3 union \nterritories, FICC has 616 branches that cover more than 600 towns and 55,000 villages, staffed \nby over 13,600 employees who serve 3 million customers. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n6.  Overview. FICC has established a core market niche serving the customer segment with \nan income range that is below the level traditionally targeted by banks and above the level served \nby microfinance institutions. FICC estimates that nearly 75 million households in India fall within \nthis category, comprised of self-employed and salaried individuals with incomes that range \nbetween \u20b9200,000\u2013\u20b9450,000 per annum (approximately $2,800\u2013$6,400) in rural areas and \n\u20b9450,000\u2013\u20b91.1 million (approximately $6,400-$15,800) in urban areas. To address the unmet and \nunderserved needs of this segment for tailored financial services, FICC has adopted differentiated \nrural (includes semi-urban) and urban strategies to engage efficiently across the customers\u2019 \nbusiness and income growth life cycles, with deliberate and distinct product and strategy mixes. \nFICC\u2019s rural business products are marketed under the Gramshakti brand and include group \n \n8  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex: India. World Bank financial inclusion data for 2017, the latest \nyear reported in its database, show only 8% of males and 5% of females over the age of 15 in India borrowed from \na financial institution. \n ", "3 \nloans to women borrowers, MSME working capital loans, loans against property (LAP), and two-\nwheeler loans. The product mix for urban clients includes SME and commercial vehicle loans, the \nlatter of which is a new product with demonstrated high growth potential.10 \n \n7.  Business strategy. FICC seeks to build on its market position as a financial services \ncompany  focused  on  MSMEs  and  other  underserved  low-income  segments  and  scale  its \noperations across India. Specific plans include expanding its branch network from 616 as of \n9MFY2019 to 790 as of fiscal year end (FYE) 2021, opening most of these new branches in rural \nareas, in line with the demand\u2013supply dynamics of the market. During this period, FICC targets \nincreasing the contribution of rural segment loans from 33% to 40% of the portfolio. Beyond its \ngeographical expansion, the company also aims to expand its product portfolio in new secured \nbusiness segments, such as consumer durable loans, dairy loans, and loans against shares. \nComplementing the \u201chigh touch\u201d aspects of FICC\u2019s business strategy is the use of high-tech digital \ntechnology. FICC has invested considerably in the development of its digital technology platform \nto leverage multichannel availability of lending solutions. FICC also uses digital tools to assist in \nits business decision-making process, including using analytics to better target clients, automating \npart of the credit approval process, managing return volatility, identifying early indications of \nstress, and guiding deployment of collection resources based on score cards. In time, FICC seeks \nto  provide  a fully  digitized  onboarding  process,  starting  from  biometric-enabled  know-your-\ncustomer forms to digitally accepted electronic agreements, using geo-location and electronic \ndata validation of application information, and finally to online platforms for customer servicing \nthrough web- and mobile-based self-service. This will be complemented by mobile wallets and \nonline payment platforms to improve the effectiveness of collections processes. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n8.  Ownership. FICC is a wholly owned subsidiary of FFH. FFH has 4.31% direct ownership \nof FICC, while the remaining 95.69% is indirectly held through Angelica Investments Pte. Ltd., a \nSingapore-based  asset  management  company  and  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  FFH. \nEstablished in 2003, FFH is a long-term strategic and operating investor in financial and related \nservices in emerging markets throughout Asia. FFH is wholly owned by Temasek Holdings \n(Private)  Limited,  a  Singapore-based  global  investment  company.  FFH  provides  financial \nproducts and services to the lower-income and emerging middle-class customer segments, and \nMSMEs through its various holdings across the region. Integrity due diligence was conducted, \nand no significant or potentially significant integrity risks were found.11 The beneficial owners do \nnot appear to constitute a significant or potentially significant integrity risk, in the absence of any \nunresolved or substantiated adverse media or other information related to the individuals.12 \n \n9.  Corporate governance. FICC has a robust and experienced board of directors, following \nthe regulatory requirements of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India, the country\u2019s capital markets regulator. The nine-member board is comprised of \nfive independent directors with expertise in the financial services industry, FFH\u2019s chief executive \nofficer (CEO), FICC\u2019s managing director, and two nonexecutive directors representing FFH. The \nboard\u2019s committee structure includes the audit, risk oversight, nomination and remuneration, \ncorporate social responsibility, and information technology strategy committees, as well as a \n \n10 FICC also launched a housing finance business in December 2015 through the creation of the wholly owned \nsubsidiary Fullerton India Home Finance Company, which operates through 82 branches in 13 states. \n11 ADB. 2003.

Membership of each committee is majority held \nby independent directors along with one nonexecutive director. FICC also has four operational \nmanagement committees\u2014for assets and liabilities, operational risk, borrowings, and customer \nservice and grievances. The operating committees are supported by members of FFH as special \ninvitee members. \n \n10.  Management.  FICC  has  a  highly  experienced  management team  led  by  managing \ndirector and CEO Ms. Rajashree Nambiar. The former CEO and executive director of India \nInfoline Finance Ltd. (the NBFI arm of the IIFL Group), Ms. Nambiar has more than 25 years of \nbanking and financial sector experience. FICC\u2019s senior management team has more than 15 \nyears\u2019 experience on average and a strong track record of leading business  units in their \nrespective segments at various international and domestic banks as well as at other large \ncorporations. FICC also benefits from the strong support of its parent company, FFH, in terms of \ntechnical expertise. The senior management team from FFH regularly participates in FICC\u2019s \nmonthly asset\u2013liability and credit risk reviews through designated committees and continuously \nprovides support and guidance. \n \n11.  Risk management. FICC has a well-defined risk appetite framework that is approved by \nthe board of directors. The risk framework sets defined risk limits for each credit, liquidity, \noperational, and reputational risk to balance returns and earnings targets with core financial needs \nfor solvency and volatility management. In terms of organizational structure, FICC\u2019s chief risk \nofficer reports directly to the board of directors and to the board of director\u2019s risk oversight \ncommittee on a quarterly basis at a minimum. The four-member board risk oversight committee \nmaintains responsibility for oversight and monitoring of the company\u2019s risk framework, with \nprogram approval directly reviewed by FFH\u2019s risk management team. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s secured debt financing up to $150 million (in Indian rupee equivalent) will be \nprovided to FICC in one or both of the following modalities described in Table 1: \n \nTable 1: Financing Modalities \nBilateral External Commercial Borrowing \nNonconvertible Debentures  (ECB) Loan \nStructure Options  (8 years)  (8 years) \nOn or Offshore  Onshore domestic debenture\u2014senior  Onshore senior secured loan\u2014settled in \u20b9 \nsecured, settled in \u20b9 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n13.  Nonconvertible debentures, a bilateral loan, or a combination of these two modalities will \nbe considered, depending on market conditions and client needs. ADB\u2019s financing will be senior \nsecured, with recourse to FICC\u2019s balance sheet. ADB may enter into risk transfers with eligible \ncounterparties for a portion of the exposure. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Use of proceeds. FICC will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s facility to finance loans to MSMEs \nin India. At least 50% of the ADB facility will be for loans in lagging states, where financial inclusion \n ", "5 \nlevels are lower than elsewhere in the country. FICC will also implement a GAP to expand lending \nto women-led MSMEs across India. At least 60% of the ADB facility will finance loans to women \nMSME borrowers. \n \n15.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. FICC will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals \nand  as  requested,  including  (i)  quarterly  unaudited financial  statements,  (ii) annual  audited \nfinancial  statements,  (iii)  semiannual  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants,  (iv) \nsemiannual reports on the use of ADB proceeds for loans in lagging states and to women-led \nMSMEs, (v) annual reports on selected development indicators agreed by ADB and the borrower, \nand (vi) GAP implementation monitoring. \n \n16.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Provide access to longer tenor debt. The proposed transaction will support FICC\u2019s \ngrowth  as  it  further  builds  its  presence  in  rural  areas  and  provides  increasing  access  to \nunderserved clients in India\u2019s lagging states. ADB\u2019s longer -term debt financing will provide \nneeded resources to help FICC manage its longer-term loans in both rural and urban areas as \nthe  company  expands  its  secured  and  unsecured  MSME  business  loan  portfolios.  ADB\u2019s \nproposed loan facility will also support FICC\u2019s efforts to narrow the asset\u2013liability management \ngap in its 3\u20135-year and greater than 5 years duration buckets where local markets are unable to \nprovide reasonable funding sources. FICC estimates that it will need \u20b975 billion per annum of \nadditional debt funding during FY2019\u2013FY2021 to meet its overall growth targets. ADB\u2019s debt \nfinancing of up to $150 million (in Indian rupee equivalent) will support FICC\u2019s longer tenor \nfinancing and would be equivalent to 10% of this requirement for the next 12 months. \n \n18.  Support  the  growth  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  the \ndevelopment of the missing middle. ADB funding will support the growth of FICC\u2019s MSME \nfinancing portfolio, helping improve access to finance for the missing middle, specifically targeting \nthe  female  missing-middle,  and  providing  needed  financial  products  and  services  to  this \nunderserved segment. In addition to providing MSMEs\u2014many of which are in rural areas or \nlagging states and/or women-led\u2014with access to finance for working capital and investment \nneeds, this transaction will promote entrepreneurship and contribute to enterprise development. \n \n19.  Support Fullerton India Credit Company\u2019s gender action plan to increase access to \nfinance for women-led micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The full potential of \nwomen-led MSMEs is constrained by their limited access to finance and the credit needed to start \nand grow their businesses (para. 4). The situation is further compounded by the limited awareness \nand understanding of financial products by many women-led MSMEs, the lack of experience with \nbanking institutions; the lack of collateral with which to guarantee credit; and the requirement, in \nmany instances, of having a male family member cosign the loan application (footnote 6). FICC\u2019s \ntotal loan portfolio will more than double over the next 5 years; however, growth of the women \nMSME loan portfolio will increase by only 1.5 times because of the aforementioned issues, as \nwell as the challenges of outreach to women clients, especially in rural areas and lagging states \n(footnote 6). It is important to note, however, that FICC targets more than 60% of its borrowers to \nbe women, well above the national baseline in which only 5% of women borrowed from a formal \nfinancial institution in 2017. Therefore, ADB\u2019s funding of FICC will contribute to reducing gender \n ", "6 \nfinancing gaps. The size of a business can affect its capacity to access higher levels of credit. \nSince most women\u2019s businesses are microenterprises and men\u2019s businesses tend to be small or \nmedium-sized, the average size of loans to female borrowers is also significantly smaller than \nthat to male borrowers. The GAP developed through this transaction, especially the use of tools \nto target women borrowers and lagging regions, as well as the development of gender-inclusive \nfinancial products, will strengthen and expand FICC\u2019s effort to provide financial services to women \nentrepreneurs and contribute to the objective of increasing the participation of women-led MSMEs \nin the sector. This will be complemented by new activities committed to by FICC as part of this \nproject to provide women with relevant financial and digital literacy skills, access to leadership \npositions, and opportunities for young women to acquire new skills and employment. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n20.  Impact.  The  project  is aligned  with the  following  impact:  access to  finance for the \nunderserved enhanced in alignment with the Government of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, \nwhich highlights the delivery of affordable banking and other financial services to unserved or \nunderserved groups as a means to promote poverty reduction and inclusive growth through \nemployment generation.13 \n \n21.  Outcomes. The project will sustainably expand FICC\u2019s lending activities to MSMEs. \n \n22.  Outputs. The outputs will be that (i) FICC\u2019s capacity for MSME lending, particularly to \nwomen is increased; (ii) FICC\u2019s lending activities to rural and semi-urban segments is increased; \n(iii) that FICC\u2019s lending in lagging states is sustainably expanded; (iv) FICC\u2019s institutional capacity \nto  render  services  to  female  employees  is  enhanced;  and  (v)  FICC\u2019s  corporate  social \nresponsibility programs targeting female beneficiaries are sustained and expanded to new areas. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n23.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  ADB\u2019s  new  long-term \ninstitutional framework, Strategy 2030, emphasizes ADB support for the financial sector by \nhelping develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services.14 The transaction \nwill contribute to financial sector development by supporting the growth of an NBFI which is \nimportant to providing increased access to finance for MSMEs in India.15 According to ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue \nto support the three country partnership strategy strategic priorities in a crosscutting manner by \ncatalyzing financial sector development.16 The transaction will support the development of the \nMSME sector in India, particularly in rural areas, as part of one of the strategy\u2019s three key pillars \n \n13 Project defined based on the Government of India\u2019s financial inclusion agenda, which includes such initiatives as the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (Prime Minister\u2019s People Money Scheme), priority sector lending, and the digital \nIndia scheme; ADB. 2017.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n24.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).18 \n25.  The investments are classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and as \ncategory FI (treated as C) for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the proposed investments and associated risks have been \nassessed, as well as the company\u2019s commitment to and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement. FICC will not use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s funding to finance projects with category \nA impacts on the environment or category A or B impacts for involuntary settlement or indigenous \npeoples. FICC will apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, ensure that investments using \nADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and establish and maintain an environmental and social management system \nsatisfactory to ADB before the first disbursement of the loans.19 FICC\u2019s environmental and social \nmanagement system includes arrangements to comply with national labor laws, ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), and internationally recognized core labor standards. Since the project \ninvolves the financing of MSMEs with ADB proceeds, it will have very limited direct climate change \nimpact.  \n \n26.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development, \nFICC  will  commit  to  incorporating  measures  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the GAP proposed by ADB include targets \nto (i) increase access of women-led MSMEs to FICC\u2019s loan products, customized to address the \nneeds of women borrowers; (ii) increase the number of women employees in FICC as well as \nwomen representation in branches and senior management; (iii) improve the competency of FICC \nemployees to deliver services responsive to the needs of women borrowers; and (iv) strengthen \nits corporate social responsibility program by targeting women beneficiaries and introduce new \nwomen-focused initiatives that enhance the skills of women on computer literacy, online business, \nand entrepreneurship. FICC will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures \nto ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n27.  FICC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. FICC\u2019s know-your-\ncustomer and anti-money-laundering policies (subject to annual board approval in May of each \nyear), in addition to RBI requirements, mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing. ADB will ensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \n17 ADB. 2013.
