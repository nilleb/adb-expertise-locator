THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Science and Technology Human Resource \nDevelopment Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the government in developing the applied science and technology \nfaculties in four universities to nurture a new breed of technology-oriented graduates equipped \nwith market relevant skills and entrepreneurial spirit.1 It will address lack of financing for priority \ndegree programs, which are in high demand from students and industry. The project will provide \ninnovative  and  industry-relevant  technology  education  and  research  facilities,  help  quality \ncurriculum  design  and  academic  staffing  aligned  with  international  standards,  and  provide \ncompetitive grant scheme and capacity development opportunities.  \n   \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sri Lanka has recorded steady economic growth of 5.2% per annum for the last decade.2 \nPer capita gross national income was $3,840 in 2017, well on track to become an upper middle-\nincome country.3 To achieve higher incomes and better standards of living, the government \nenvisions transforming to a knowledge-based economy by 2025.4 Investment in human capital is \nprioritized for economic diversification and enhanced productivity.5 Sri Lanka ranked 73rd in the \nHuman Development Index, outperforming other lower middle-income countries, and this is \nattributed to good access to education.6 Challenges remain in quality of learning, particularly in \nscience,  technology,  and  engineering  subjects,  as  well  as  relevance  to  the  labor  market, \nespecially in the face of rapid technological changes. Higher education plays an instrumental role \nin producing a future-ready labor force, but Sri Lanka\u2019s higher education system is facing several \nchallenges. \n \n4.  Limited access. Higher education opportunities are limited. The gross enrollment rate is \n18.9%, which is far lower than that of the upper middle-income country average of 50.7%.7 \nIncreasing demand for higher education is evident from steep competition for public university \nadmission, the large number of external degree program students, and increasing numbers of \nstudents seeking private higher education. Disciplines offered are largely skewed toward liberal \narts, social studies, and management, and less than 20% of graduates are from science and \nengineering subjects. As a result, less than four science, technology, and engineering graduates \nare available for every 100 age cohort in Sri Lanka, compared with over 15 in Malaysia and 30 in \n                                                \n1  The proposed project will support new degree programs in engineering technology, biosystems technology, and \ninformation and communication technology under the newly introduced technology faculties, as well as degree \nprograms in engineering faculty at Sri Jayewardenepura University. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided \nproject preparatory support through ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Sri Lanka for Human Capital Development \nCapacity and Implementation Support.

", "2 \nthe Republic of Korea. Private higher education is focusing on management and information \ntechnology (IT), where capital investment is moderate. The main constraint is high upfront capital \ninvestment requirements for higher education in science, technology, and engineering disciplines. \n  \n5.  Quality  concerns.  Research  and  practical  learning  in  science,  technology,  and \nengineering are limited because of lack of laboratory facilities, researchers, and capital investment. \nLack of qualified academic staff constrains quality of teaching, learning, and research. There were \n5,440 academic staff in 2016, but less than 50% have a doctor of philosophy degree. Recruiting \nand retaining qualified academic staff is difficult because better working conditions (e.g., salary \nand organizational culture) offered in the private sector and overseas. The vacancy rate at \nuniversities was estimated to be 28% in 2014. The pedagogy should transform from an input-\nbased approach to outcome-based education and student-centered learning to foster critical \nthinking and problem-solving competencies as well as other modern job market requirements \nsuch as entrepreneurship and leadership, teamwork and collaboration, and communication.  \n \n6.  Areas of improvement for job market relevance. Job placement rates are high for \ngraduates in IT (92%), engineering (92%), and science (83%) compared with overall average \n(66%). However, even among science, technology, and engineering graduates, cognitive and \nnoncognitive skills, such as analytical thinking, problem solving, communications, and teamwork, \nneed further improvement. Degree programs are more theory-oriented and lack application or \npractical use of knowledge and skills. Such deficiency becomes evident in the skills gaps among \ncurrent industry managers from those disciplines. Flexibility and ability to continuously learn and \nupgrade skills are the competencies most needed for science, technology and engineering \ngraduates to survive and lead the rapid technological changes.  \n \n7.  Gender dimension. Over 60% of undergraduates are female students in Sri Lanka. \nHowever, female enrollment is more concentrated in liberal arts and social studies (82.4%) where \nunemployment is the highest. Gender parity in computer science or IT and technology faculties \n(50.4% and 45.6% female) is nearly achieved, and around 22.0% of engineering students are \nfemale. This is higher than the developed-country average. Encouraging more women to take \ntechnology disciplines will increase women\u2019s career opportunities in technical areas where wages \nare high. This would also help challenge stereotypical gender roles in the economy, and increase \nwomen\u2019s labor market participation in nontraditional areas.  \n \n8.  Opportunities  in  science,  technology,  and  engineering  education.  Despite \nimpressive employment outcomes, there were only 5,012 admissions for science, technology, \nand engineering in 2016, which is only 17.2% of total admissions. The main constraint is financing. \nThe  government  expects  that  priority  economic  development  initiatives,  like  the  Colombo\u2013\nTrincomalee Economic Corridor, would generate 580,000 incremental jobs in manufacturing \nbetween 2020 and 2032, and around 10%\u201315% of such job opportunities would require advanced \nskills in technology. One of the constraints to such development initiative would be the lack of a \nskilled workforce.  \n \n9.  Government  initiatives. In  response to  the  high  demand for  a  technically-oriented \nworkforce and the need for diversifying pathways for youth, the government introduced the \ntechnology stream to secondary education (grades 12 and 13) in 2013. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) supported this initiative through its Education Sector Development Program.8 Since \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Results-Based Loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila. \n \n ", "3 \n2015, around 7,000 technology stream students have become qualified for higher education \nannually. The government selected 11 public universities to open new technology faculties to offer \nhigher education for technology stream students.9 In 2016, 2,016 students were enrolled in \ntechnology faculties. With the support from the World Bank, the government has already provided \nfinancing to get the technology faculties started for 8 public universities.10 The government \nrequested ADB support for the remaining 3 universities\u2014Kelaniya, Rajarata, and Sabaragamuwa \nto develop their technology faculties. In addition, the government requested ADB to support \nestablishment of an engineering faculty at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura which is yet to \nbe supported by other development partners. \n \n10.  Lessons and project focus. In addition to very much needed modern facilities and \nqualified  faculty  members,  these  middle-tier  universities  should  introduce  new  practices  in \npedagogy, student guidance, and industry linkages. Lessons from previous development partner \nhigher education support indicate that developing new technology and engineering faculties in \nthese universities will result in opportunities to demonstrate strong industry linkages, employment \nfocus, and other innovative approaches, avoiding the accumulated inertia of past academic \nbureaucracy. Such approaches would set examples for other faculties within the universities to \nfollow. A competitive grant scheme will be used to encourage collaborations with industry and \ninternational university partners.11  \n \n11.  Alignment with country strategy. Increasing access to higher education, especially with \ntechnology  focus  and  industry  demand,  is  a  priority  in  the  government\u2019s  medium-term \ndevelopment strategy (footnote 5). The project is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka, and contributes to pillar 1 (promoting economic diversification \nand productivity enhancement) by upgrading human capital.12 The project is included in the \ncountry operations business plan 2018\u20132020.13 The project will support the government in \npreparing a new higher education project proposed for 2021 (output 5).  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB support brings additional value beyond infrastructure by (i) \nadopting the latest facility design features for higher technology education, green building, and \nrenewable energy solutions; (ii) supporting climate-proofing design in infrastructure to address \nvulnerability to climate change risk, especially floods from increased unpredictable precipitation \nand storm surges; (iii) mobilizing technical experts to support academic program design; (iv) \nsupporting  internationally  recognized  accreditation;  and  (v)  including  industry  collaboration, \ninternational university partnerships, and faculty staff capacity development. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: an educated and knowledgeable labor \nforce  for  accelerated  economic  growth  is  developed.14 The  project  will  have  the  following \noutcome: access to employment-oriented higher technology education improved.15  \n \n                                                \n9  These are the universities of Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kelaniya, Jaffna, Ruhuna, Eastern, South Eastern, \nRajarata, Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba, and Uva Wellessa.  \n10 The World Bank. 2017.

Output 1: Innovative technology learning and research environment established. \nThis output will address the main constraint in access by constructing well-equipped faculty \nbuildings following green building standards with climate proofing. Renewable energy systems \n(solar  and  wind)  will  be  incorporated  in  the  buildings. The facilities  will  support  the  latest \npedagogical approaches in higher education, such as project-based learning, peer learning, and \nstudent-centered learning, using flexibly adjustable spaces for different types of research and \nindustry collaborations. Each university will incorporate adequate laboratory facilities for practical \nlearning. All universities will include industry collaboration and innovation centers designed to \nmeet different industry demands.16 Operation of such industry collaboration facilities will also be \nsupported with a competitive grant scheme (output 3). The universities will carry out joint activities \nsuch as training and exchange programs to maximize the utilization of laboratories and industry \ncollaboration and innovation centers as well as peer-learning of good practices. The new faculties \nwill include facilities that empower female students and academic and nonacademic staff in the \nacademic and social life of the university such as a day care center. This will also help male staff \nshare the child care burden of working spouses and promote balanced gender roles.  \n \n15.  Output 2: Quality and industry-relevant higher technology education programs \nimplemented. This output will support development of new strains of technology and engineering \nprograms in four universities, differentiated based on industry demand, university strengths, and \nstrategic niches. The universities will develop complete degree program curricula up to fourth \nyear, incorporating industry inputs and aligned with international standards. The curricula will \ninclude subjects or modules to instill entrepreneurship in students, organize mentorship programs \nlinking students and entrepreneurs, and inspire students through career guidance centers (output \n4). Delivery of academic programs will also incorporate best practices in technical education \n(outputs 3 and 4). Bachelor of engineering technology degree programs will be aligned with the \nSydney Accord, and bachelor of engineering degrees with the Washington Accord, and both will \nbe accredited by the Sri Lanka Institution of Engineers as international standards. Other programs \nwill seek suitable international accreditation within the project period. This quality assurance \nmechanism through accreditation will ensure the graduates\u2019 qualifications are internationally \nrecognized, and maintain the quality of the program over time. This output will also ensure there \nare adequate qualified academic staff for the new technology programs. The project will support \nrecruitment and training of academic staff so that at least 90% of approved cadre positions are \nfilled, and at least 60% of those appointed are doctors of philosophy. The universities will recruit \nand retain qualified female academic staff.   \n \n16.  Output 3: Industry linkages and international collaborations strengthened. This \noutput will ensure the curricula developed and implemented under output 2 are well informed by \nindustry demand and international best practices, and the physical facilities established under \noutput 1 are fully utilized. The universities will develop joint proposals with industry partners for (i) \nresearch and development activities to resolve industry problems or come up with new products \nor services; (ii) customized training programs to meet industry demand in technology areas to \nimprove students\u2019 employability or upgrade existing workers\u2019 skills; and (iii) other innovations in \nindustry\u2013university linkages.

More models will be \nexplored through industry and international university partnerships (output 3).  \n ", "5 \nteaching and learning in higher education; and (iii) joint research activities, especially in industry-\nrelevant areas. The project will provide funding to support proposals competitively selected by a \ntechnical committee established by the Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs (MHECA) \nand University Grants Commission. \n \n17.  Output  4:  Faculty  management  capacity  strengthened. This  output  will  enhance \nfaculty staff capacity in creating a modern and dynamic academic culture focusing on developing \na  future-ready  workforce.  Staff  performance  management  systems  will  be  strengthened  to \ncontinuously improve teaching and learning practices of academic staff, and industry collaboration. \nFaculty staff will be trained in areas such as innovative teaching and learning, student services, \nand industry collaboration and services so that employment-oriented technology programs can \nbe  effectively  supported.  Non-academic  staff  capacity  will  be  also  strengthened  through \nstructured professional development programs in selected areas such as library management, \nstudent services and counseling, laboratory management, and project management. The output \nwill ensure that the universities have dedicated centers for career guidance that will facilitate \nindustry attachment programs for students, especially for the career progression of female \ngraduates, through mentoring and networking.  \n \n18.  Output 5: New higher education project preparation supported. This output will \nsupport new project development focusing on science and technology disciplines and research \nand development.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 12.3%, which \nis above the 6.0% threshold for social sector projects. The principal benefits considered in the \nanalysis were wages for technology and engineering program graduates. The principal costs are \nfor civil works, equipment, opportunity cost of attending universities (i.e., wages that can be \nearned by secondary education graduates), laboratory equipment replacement, and recurrent \ncosts including salaries and maintenance. A sensitivity analysis indicates that overall investment \nwould remain economically viable with a 10% capital cost overrun and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n25.  Financial sustainability. Despite limited fiscal resources in recent years, the government \nprioritizes higher education in Vision 2025 (footnote 5). Expenditure on higher education has \nincreased in recent years, and expected to increase or at least be maintained at the current level. \nThe unit recurrent cost of undergraduate students suggests that investment in engineering \neducation is lower than in other science disciplines. An expenditure analysis indicates that the \nfour universities manage their programs efficiently given the below-average unit recurrent cost of \nundergraduate students. The project will introduce a competitive grant scheme to promote \ninnovations, which will supplement the relatively small budget for research activities (6.0% of \ncapital expenditure or 2.3% of overall higher education budget). More budget allocation for \nrehabilitation and maintenance of capital assets (capital expenditure) and maintenance services \n(recurrent expenditure) will be required for the sustainability of the project. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial management. The financial management risk is substantial mainly because of \n(i) staff capacity constraints (vacant positions, capacity issues, and regular staff turn-over); (ii) \ngaps in fixed asset control, information systems, and internal auditor capacity; and (iii) delays in \nexternal audit. A project management unit (PMU) under MHECA and the project implementation \nunits (PIUs) at the four universities will effectively implement the project while mitigating identified \n ", "8 \nfiduciary risks. The PMU and PIUs will have dedicated procurement and financial management \nspecialists, and project accountants in addition to MHECA and university staff assigned to support \nthe project for effective segregation of duties and internal check. The PMU will hire a dedicated \ninternal auditor for the project to support the ministry and university internal auditors. The PMU \nwill also source accounting software to be used by all PIUs for efficient financial management and \nreporting, including fixed-asset inventories. A qualified external auditor, confirmed by the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department, will be appointed to audit consolidated project financial statements in a \ntimely manner so that audit findings and recommendations can improve project implementation.   \n \n27.  Procurement. The procurement capacity assessment concluded that MHECA and the \nfour universities have adequate capacity to carry out the project successfully, subject to enforcing \nfiduciary controls.18 PMU and PIU staff will be trained in overall procurement management, \nfocusing on the weaknesses in the current system and practices. Two universities with less \nexposure to large civil works and goods procurement will be given additional technical support \nand continuous monitoring to fill the identified gaps. All procurement of works, goods, and services \nwill  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB \nProcurement Regulations (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n28.  Anticorruption. The mechanisms to investigate and combat corruption in the public \nsector include the independent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption \nand the Financial Crimes Investigation Division under the Sri Lanka Police. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MHECA, \nand the universities. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the project administration manual (footnote 19). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  State universities offer undergraduate programs for free with merit-based (40% of seats) \nand regional quota (60%) admissions, allowing greater social inclusion. Increased enrollment in \nemployment-oriented higher education programs will reduce youth unemployment. The project is \ncategorized as gender equity, and the gender action plan has been prepared, informed by focus \ngroup discussions with faculty members and students.19 The project will provide adequate sex-\nsegregated and special-need toilets, and stairs, ramps, and lights will be made accessible to all, \nincluding people with special needs. Academic staff recruitment includes gender considerations. \nSpecial programs for training, mentoring, career guidance, and employment support will be \nprovided for female students.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows. \n \n31.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project  will  construct  new  faculty  facilities  to \naccommodate more than 5,000 students and faculty staff across four different locations. An initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared for each location, in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS and \nthe  government\u2019s  environmental  requirements  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website. 20 Public \nconsultations were carried out with local residents, university staff, and public and private sector \n                                                \n18 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nagencies. The initial environmental examinations identified environmental impacts by location and \ntime. Mitigation measures focus on (i) solid-waste management and wastewater drainage and \ntreatment, (ii) reservation limits to minimize project impact to a nearby water body, and (iii) \noccupational health and safety. The initial environmental examinations propose (i) capacity \nbuilding for the PMU and PIUs, (ii) inclusion of an environmental management plan in bidding \ndocuments, and (iii) inspection and supervision during construction. At the detailed engineering \ndesign stage, the PMU will update and finalize the environmental management plan. Estimated \ncosts to implement this plan were included in the project costs. The PMU will ensure effective \nenvironmental monitoring at all stages of subproject implementation. University management, \nsupported by PIUs, will be responsible for any grievances following the existing practices for \nuniversity-related matters.  \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). Three out of the four universities acquired lands \nfor the faculty facility development; and the fourth university already had its own land. No \nadditional land will be acquired under this project. The due diligence report confirms that there is \nno involuntary resettlement impact in the acquired land as per the SPS.  \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples within the project \narea as per the SPS.  \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.
