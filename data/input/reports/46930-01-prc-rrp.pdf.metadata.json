The country\u2019s urban population has more than tripled, from \n190 million in 1980 to 691 million in 2011, accounting for 51.3% of the national population; it is \nexpected to account for more than 60% of the total by 2030, an incremental increase of about \n200  million  people.  This  demographic  shift  has  led  to  significant  increases  in  municipal  solid-\nwaste (MSW) generation. Although the per capita production of solid waste in the PRC is only \nabout 21% of the average in industrialized nations, it is expected to grow considerably in small \nand medium-sized cities in particular where population growth of 24% by 2030 is expected. \n \n\nFigure 1: Urban Population Growth Projection by City Size \n in the PRC \n\n \n)\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nm\n\nl\n\n(\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\nu\np\no\nP\nn\na\nb\nr\nU\n\n \n\n1000 \n900 \n800 \n700 \n600 \n500 \n400 \n300 \n200 \n100 \n0 \n\n44 \n\n206 \n\n213 \n\n43 \n130 \n\n25 \n134 \n\n164 \n\n44 \n99 \n\n97 \n\n322 \n\n247 \n\n71 \n\n163 \n\n mega-city (> 10 \nmillion) \n\n large city (> 1 \nmillion\u201310 million) \n\n medium-sized city (> \n0.2 million\u20131 million) \n\n small city (20,000\u2013\n200,000) \n\n town (< 20,000) \n\n \n\n2000 \n\n2010 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n2030 \nProjection \n\n \n3.  \nIn the past, the provision of MSW treatment was considered a basic social right and was \nprovided  by  the  government  free  of  charge.  This  system  has  led  to  a  serious  environmental \nproblem in municipalities, where large quantities of waste are dumped in unengineered landfills. \nFurthermore,  an  imbalance  in  the  quality  of  project  development  has  been  observed  between \nlarge  and  small  cities,  with  only  a  limited  number  of  small  cities  having  appropriate  waste \ndisposal facilities.1  \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Urban Wastewater and Solid Waste Management for Small \n\nCities and Towns. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\nWaste-to-energy  (WTE)  is  recognized  as  the  single  most  effective  method  for  MSW \n4. \ntreatment,  as  it  reduces  waste  volume  by  90%  and  eliminates  methane  emissions.  WTE \ntechnologies  recover the  waste  heat from  the  incineration process  and  produce  electricity  and \nheat.  By  substituting  for  fossil  fuel  combustion  and  avoiding  methane,  it  reduces  greenhouse \ngas  emissions  and  mitigates  climate  change.  Under  its  12th  Five  Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015,  the \nGovernment of the PRC targets to (i) treat 100% of MSW in municipalities larger than province \ncapital cities, and the cities specifically designated in the state plan, and treat over 90% in other \nsmaller cities; and (ii) among waste treatment options, treat 35% through WTE technologies. It \nis estimated that investment of CNY173 billion ($27.3 billion) in MSW treatment facilities will be \nrequired.  The  government  has  further  issued  a  series  of  policies  and  regulations  to  support \nmunicipal  WTE,  such  as  (i)  full  offtake  of  electricity  generated  by  WTE  plants;  (ii) national \ntargets  by  2015,  including  20%  of  the  total  energy  to  be  generated  from  renewable  energy \nsources and municipal WTE capacity to reach 3 gigawatts; (iii) value-added tax refund; and (iv) \nelectricity  feed-in  tariff  of  CNY0.65  per  kilowatt-hour  for  municipal WTE  plants,  compared  with \nthe  nationwide  average  base  rate  tariff  of  CNY0.40  per  kilowatt-hour  from  coal-based  power \ngeneration. \n\n \n5. \nTo  achieve  these  national  targets  and  to  promote  cleaner  WTE  technologies  with \nsustainable financing and the timely delivery of public services, increasing numbers of municipal \ngovernments,  including  those  of  smaller  cities,  have  been  opening  the  sector  for  specialized \nWTE  companies  through  concession.  However,  a  lack  of  access  to  finance  has  been  a \nbottleneck to promoting cleaner waste management projects in smaller cities. \n \n6. \nIn response to the PRC\u2019s increasing challenges of ensuring livable cities and sustainable \ndevelopment,  sovereign  and  private  sector  operations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nhave  been  focusing  on  municipal  environmental  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Regional \nDepartment  has  been  supporting  broad-based  policy  and  regulatory  reforms  since  20002 and \nhas  identified  state-owned  enterprises  that  take  over  the  traditional  responsibility  of  municipal \ngovernments  in  providing  environmental  infrastructure.  Among  the  state-owned  enterprises, \nDynagreen\u2014the environmental infrastructure arm of  Beijing State-Owned Assets Management \nCompany  (BSAM)\u2014was  found  to  possess  a  desirable  business  model  that  can  leverage  its \noperational  experience  with  clean  technologies  to  pursue  new  ventures  in  small  and  medium-\nsized  cities,  which  are  often  too  small  to  attract  private  sector  participation.  Dynagreen \ndistinguishes  itself  from  its  peers 3  through  its  clear  focus  on  small  and  medium-sized \nsubprojects of 500\u20131,000 tons daily processing capacity. This is about half the average size of \nengagement of its peers. Unlike most plants in this size range, the technologies that Dynagreen \nemploys do not require coal as supplemental fuel to burn low-calorific-value waste. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  will  address  the  need  to  treat  MSW  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities  and \n7. \nsupply electricity to the local grid. The ADB loan will be channeled through Dynagreen to fund a \nseries  of  WTE  subprojects  with  total  capacity  of  up  to  6,300  tons  of  MSW  per  day  and  to \ngenerate  approximately  610  gigawatt-hours  of  electricity  annually  by  2018.  Each  subproject \nincinerates waste, recovers waste heat for power generation, purifies waste gas, and disposes \nof  ash.  The  criteria  used  in  selecting  municipalities  include  (i)  populations  of  more  than  0.5 \nmillion  generating  in  excess of  600  tons  of  MSW  per  day;  (ii) exclusive rights  to  operate WTE \n                                                \n2  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  Urban  Solid  Waste \n\nManagement. Manila. \n\n3  Private  sector  enterprises  such  as  China  Everbright  International;  and  nonsovereign  public  enterprises  such  as \n\nChongqing Sanfeng, Shanghai Environment, and Shenzhen Energy. \n\n\f3 \n\nplants  in  well-defined  areas  through  concession  agreements,  which  guarantees  a  minimum \nMSW supply; (iii) a clear and transparent municipal waste management policy; and (iv) sufficient \nfinancial capacity to uphold its end in the partnership. \n \nThe project is designed to be a least-cost solution to financing small and medium-sized \n8. \nWTE subprojects; such financing involves relatively high transaction costs. ADB aims to finance \nthe subprojects on a portfolio basis to reduce financing transaction costs and diversify risk. This \nportfolio  approach  is  broad  in  reach  and  will  enable  ADB  to  provide  financing  support  for \nmultiple WTE subprojects that are often too small and time-consuming for ADB or international \nbanks to finance on a stand-alone basis.  \n\n \n9. \nTo  achieve  long-term  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and  to  set  standards  in  the \nfast-growing  waste  management  industry,  the  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  incorporate  loan \nconditions such as maintenance of a transparent corporate governance structure and adoption \nand  maintenance  of  an  environmental  and  social  management  system  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). These components of the project are expected to serve as \nbest-practice  examples  to  Dynagreen\u2019s  peers  in  the  industry,  enhancing  its  demonstration \neffects. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Guarantor and the Borrower  \n\n10. \nBSAM will guarantee the payment obligations of the borrower under ADB\u2019s loan. Funded \nand  entrusted  by  the  Beijing  municipal  government,  BSAM  is  an  exclusively  state-invested \nlimited  liability  company  whose  subsidiaries  are  engaged  in  managing,  supervising,  and \noperating  state-owned  assets.  BSAM  focuses  its  business  investments  in four  major  fields:  (i) \nurban  development,  environmental  protection,  and  new  energies;  (ii)  financial  services;  (iii)  hi-\ntech manufacturing; and (iv) culture and sports infrastructure.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n11. \nThe borrower of the project is Dynagreen, which is the sole environmental infrastructure \nholding  company  in  the  BSAM  group.  The  scope  of  business  of  Dynagreen  and  its  project \ncompanies covers not only construction, operation, and management of WTE power plants, but \nalso  technology  research  and  development  in  relation  to  WTE  power  plants  and  consulting \nservices  on  overall  solutions  to  municipal  waste  treatment.  Since  its  incorporation  in  2000, \nDynagreen has successfully implemented municipal WTE plants and developed the proprietary \nthree-driving  and  reverse-feeding  reciprocating  grate  incineration  technology 4 based  on  the \ndesign of Martin Gmbh, one of the world's leading WTE technology providers.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n12. \nImproved  urban  solid-waste  management  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities.  The \nproject will contribute to improved municipal waste management in the PRC. The special focus \nof  the  project  is  on  small  and  medium-sized  cities  which  currently  have  significant  issues  with \nuntreated MSW, which in turn emit harmful gases and contaminate soil and groundwater. The \n\n                                                \n4  The patent was awarded by the PRC National Intellectual Property Bureau. \n\n\f4 \n\nimpact  of  deploying  effective  waste  management  technologies  such  as  incineration  under  the \nproject  is  to  catalyze  MSW  management  investments  that  treat  larger  volumes  of  municipal \nwaste in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.  \n \nIncreased renewable energy generation capacity from municipal waste. The project \n13. \nfeatures  an  innovative  model  for  state-owned  enterprises  to  take  part  in  municipal  WTE \ninfrastructure  development  on  a  concession  basis  for  multiple  subprojects.  The  demonstration \nimpact  of  the  project  is  expected  to  be  an  increase  in  similar  MSW  management  and  WTE \ninvestments  that  help  meet  the  government\u2019s  target  of  increasing  WTE-based  energy \ngeneration capacity to 3 gigawatts by 2020. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n14. \nThe  outcome  will  be  increased  production  of  energy  from  technically  efficient  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  WTE  power  plants  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities  in  the  PRC. \nThe WTE plants to be supported under the project  will treat 2.8 million tons of MSW annually, \ngenerate 610 gigawatt-hours of clean energy annually, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by \nabout  450,000  tons  per  year.  Energy  generation  from  municipal  WTE  plants  will  reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions by replacing electricity otherwise generated by coal-fired plants, and \navoiding methane otherwise generated from unsanitary landfills. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\n15. \nThe  output  will  be  the  construction  of  at  least  nine  WTE  plants  with  an  aggregate \ncapacity  of  120  megawatts.  All  the  plants  will  be  built  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009), and will also meet the national emissions standard of the PRC.     \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020  \n\n16. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  which  identified  infrastructure  and \nenvironment as two of the five core areas in which ADB will employ its financial and institutional \nresources to maximize results, efficiency, and impact.5 On infrastructure, the project will embody \nthe strategy, which sets forth that ADB will help expand the supply of energy, and support clean \nenergy.  With  respect  to  the  environment,  the  project  is  in  line  with  the  strategy's  focus  on \nclimate change and complementary actions.   \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Country Strategy \n\ntransport,  and  urban  development.  The  CPS  specifically  states \n\nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS)  for  the  PRC  is  based  on  three  development \n17. \npillars:  inclusive  growth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. 6 The  CPS  also  sets  out  four  priority  sectors:  natural  resources  and  agriculture, \nenergy, \nthat  ADB's \nnonsovereign  operations  will  continue  to  finance  catalytic  projects,  focusing  on  innovative \nfinancing solutions and demonstration projects for infrastructure investment, particularly in clean \nenergy,  urban  environmental  protection,  and  social  infrastructure.  The  project  will  address \nenergy and urban development sectors to leverage ADB\u2019s comparative strengths and expertise \n                                                \n5   ADB.  2008.

It  will  thus  contribute  to  the  CPS  objective  of  supporting  environmentally \nsustainable growth in the PRC. The project is fully consistent with the CPS and will complement \nADB\u2019s  overall  support  for  urban  development  in  the  PRC  through  investment  projects  and \nknowledge  products.  In  particular,  the  project  benefits  from  public  sector  operations\u2019  policy \nadvice and lessons learned from public sector waste management projects.   \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy \n\nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  Energy  Policy. 7  Under  the  policy,  ADB\u2019s \n18. \ninvestments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy  projects,  as  well  as \nexpansion of energy access. The policy states that support for renewable energy projects will be \nprioritized  and  broadened  with  the  objective  of  creating  a  framework  that  makes  investing  in \nrenewable energy commercially viable.  \n \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s efforts to strengthen nonsovereign operations8 and has \n19. \na significant demonstration impact as the first ADB intervention with a public enterprise to take \nover the municipal government responsibility of providing waste management infrastructure. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n20. \nDynagreen\u2019s  investment  plan  indicates  a  total  investment  of  $454  million  equivalent  to \ntreat  approximately  6,300  tons  of  waste  daily  with  installed  capacity  of  120  megawatts  to \ngenerate about 610 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually by 2018. The plan includes civil works, \nerection,  equipment  and  materials,  other  local  procurement,  and  working  capital  for  WTE \nsubprojects between 2013 and 2017.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.9 \n\n21. \n \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \nImplementation period \nConstruction arrangements \nType of arrangement \n\nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nEach project company will be awarded a concession of 25\u201330 years, and the \nconcession agreement sets out the municipal solid-waste treatment fee and the \nminimum amount of waste to be supplied by the municipal government.  \nAll WTE subprojects will be supervised and managed by Dynagreen. \nJanuary 2013\u2013January 2017 \n\nGoods and services will be procured adopting ADB\u2019s private sector procurement \nprocedures from ADB member countries in a transparent manner, through \ncompetitive bidding procedures and in accordance with Dynagreen\u2019s procurement \nguidelines.

The major costs consist of \nwaste treatment cost, maintenance expense, and administrative expense. \n\nOperation and maintenance  Operation and maintenance will generally be handled by each project company\u2019s \n\nPerformance monitoring \n\nstaff, who will be transferred from Dynagreen and/or recruited from outside.  \nKey performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, and \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, will be reported by Dynagreen. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WTE = waste-to-energy.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n22. \nThe project is financially viable as Dynagreen\u2019s expected financial internal rate of return \nis  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  and  economically  viable  as  the  economic \ninternal rate of return is higher than the social discount rate of 12%. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\n23. \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  up  to  $200  million  equivalent  in  yuan  to  Dynagreen, \ncomprising  an  A-loan  (of  up  to  $100  million  equivalent)  and  a  local  currency  complementary \nloan  (of  up  to  $100  million  equivalent).  ADB  will  fund  the  A-loan  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources  and  the  local  currency  complementary  loan  will  be  funded  by  commercial  banks. \nADB\u2019s loan will be supported by an unconditional, irrevocable payment guarantee from BSAM. \nThe proposed A-loan will have a maturity of up to 10 years, including a 4-year grace period on \nprincipal  repayments.  The  local  currency  complementary  loan  will  have  a  maturity  equal  to  or \nshorter than that of the A-loan.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Key Activities, and Output \n\n24. \nFor the project to succeed and for Dynagreen to cope with its rapid growth, well-defined, \ntransparent, effective, and efficient corporate governance is an indispensible prerequisite. Good \ngovernance  will  also  attract  commercial  lenders  and  support  Dynagreen\u2019s  plan  of  further \ncommercialization.  The  TA  will  have  two  components:  (i) assessment  and  evaluation  of \nDynagreen\u2019s  current  corporate  governance  framework  and  internal  risk  management,  and  (ii) \ncapacity building to enhance and consummate Dynagreen\u2019s corporate governance system. The \nTA  is  classified  as  capacity  development  technical  assistance  category  B  and  is  estimated  to \ncost $500,000. \n \n\n\f7 \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n\n \n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nADB will be responsible for all implementation issues but will have the full support of and \n25. \ncooperation  from  Dynagreen.  ADB  and  Dynagreen  will  form  a  TA  task  force  comprising \nrepresentatives at appropriate levels from ADB and Dynagreen, as well as the consultants to be \nhired. The task force will communicate regularly to assess needs, monitor progress, and discuss \nissues.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method \nwith  simplified  technical  proposals.  Recruitment  of  the  firm  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nC. \n\nValue-Added by ADB Assistance \n\n26. \n\nJustification for ADB\u2019s involvement in the proposed project is based on the following: \n(i) \n\nADB  will  be  catalytic  in  promoting  the  commercialization  of  MSW  treatment \nthrough a project that combines several innovative features in PRC infrastructure \nfinance. It is structured as a multiproject loan facility, in effect bundling small and \nmedium-sized  subprojects  to  avoid  the  high  transaction  costs  associated  with \nstand-alone project financing and to diversify risk. In addition, the local currency \ncomplementary  loan  will  mobilize  cofinancing  where  little  domestic  bank \nparticipation  has  been  evident  to  date,  given  the  high  transaction  costs  and \nupfront  capital  costs.  ADB\u2019s  loan  is  structured  to  provide  a  tenor  sufficient  to \nallow Dynagreen to amortize these upfront capital costs over the long life of the \nassets and ensure its investments are commercially viable. \nBy  promoting the know-how  transfer to smaller municipalities  under commercial \nconcessions,  ADB  will  be  supporting environmentally  sustainable improvements \nin  waste  treatment  and  contributing  to  the  PRC\u2019s  renewable  energy  generation \nactivities. The  project  builds on  ADB\u2019s  complementary  interventions  with  private \ncompanies in the areas of WTE projects in second-tier cities.10 ADB\u2019s experience \nwith the project can meaningfully contribute to the dialogue on regulations in the \nPRC and the region, and reflects a continuation of ADB\u2019s effort to help establish \neffective and efficient solutions for waste management.  \nADB\u2019s  requirements  will  ensure  that  Dynagreen  adheres  to  high  standards  of \ncorporate  governance  and  environmental  and  social  protection,  serving  as  a \nmodel  for  the  industry  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities.  ADB  will  support \nDynagreen\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  its  corporate  governance  in  alignment  with  the \nprinciples set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \nand  the  TA  will  advise  on  development  of  enhanced  corporate  governance, \nprivatization, and minority shareholding rights. \n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nD. \n\nRisks \n\n27. \nGuarantor credit risk. ADB\u2019s loan will be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by \nBSAM.  Detailed  analysis  shows  the  credit  strengths  of  BSAM  including  (a)  strong  market \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance  for  the  Municipal  Waste-to-Energy  Project  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  Manila;  ADB.  2012. \nReport  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loans  to  China  Everbright \nInternational Limited for the Agricultural and Municipal Waste-to-Energy Project in the PRC. Manila. \n\n\f8 \n\nposition  of  most  of  its  operating  subsidiaries  given  its  close  relationship  with  the  Beijing \nmunicipal government, (b) stable revenue growth, (c) good financial flexibility, and (d) moderate \nleverage position and strong equity base. These are constrained by BSAM\u2019s moderate earnings, \ncash flow coverage, and substantial exposure to high-tech industrial park development. BSAM\u2019s \noverall credit standing is assessed satisfactory and provides an adequate credit enhancement.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nAggressive expansion plan. Dynagreen\u2019s plan to develop up to nine plants with a total \n28. \ndaily capacity of up to 6,300 tons in four years\u2019 time requires significant management resources; \nand substantial capital funding.  This aggressive expansion plan involves execution and funding \nrisks  which  are  partially  mitigated  by:  (a)  Dynagreen\u2019s  technical  competence,  including  use  of \nstandardized  management  systems  across  its  subprojects,  use  of  industry  experts,  shared \ntechnical  resources  at  several  operational  hubs,  and  the  homogeneous  nature  of  the \nsubprojects, and (b) adoption of eligibility criteria in the selection of subprojects and monitoring \nof compliance with financial covenants to ensure project viability. \n \n29. \nCompletion  risk.  The  project  involves  high  capital  expenditure  for  the  construction  of \nWTE  plants,  making  cost  overrun  and  delay  a  potential  risk.  This  is  mitigated  by  Dynagreen\u2019s \ntechnical expertise and control measures, including progress payments with subcontractors. \n \n30. \nOperation  and  maintenance  risk.  Due  diligence  has  confirmed  Dynagreen\u2019s  reliable \ntrack  record  in  existing  WTE  plants  and  its  ability  to  increase  efficiency  and  meet  quality  and \nsafety  standards.  Dynagreen  also  implemented  standardized  control  systems  to  minimize \noperation risks and it has management expertise, strong technical training system, and rotation \nof senior engineers. \n \n31.  Waste  supply  and treatment  fee risk. Revenue risk may arise from low waste supply \nand  treatment  fees.  Mitigating  this  risk  are  (a)  large  latent  demand  for  waste  treatment  and \nDynagreen\u2019s  practice  of  selecting  subprojects  in  part  based  on  demand  potential;  (b) \ngovernment  policies  which  mandate  that  tariffs  provide  cost-recovery  and  adequate  returns  to \nutility  operators;  (c)  concession  agreements  with  guaranteed  minimum  waste  supply;  (d) \nDynagreen\u2019s  assessment  of  waste  treatment  fees  to  ensure  financial  viability  in  selecting \nsubprojects;  (e)  the  portfolio  nature  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance,  which  diversifies  risk  across \nsubprojects;  and  (f)  Dynagreen\u2019s  track  record,  which  will  assist  in  securing  the  support  of \nmunicipal governments in aggregating waste from surrounding smaller counties. \n\n \n32. \nRegulatory  risk.    It  is  unclear  whether  the  current  fixed  feed-in  tariff  will  remain \nunchanged during the life of ADB\u2019s loan as it appears that the regulator can change the tariff at \nits  discretion.  In  the  worst  case,  should  the  feed-in  tariff  be  abolished,  the  regulations  still \nsupport premium over the average coal-fired tariff applicable for 15 years from operation.   \n \n33. \nStructural  subordination.  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  be  structurally  subordinated  to  direct  loans \nraised  by  the  project  companies  from  local  banks.  This  risk  is  partially  mitigated  by  various \nmeasures employed by other ADB projects with similar project structure. \n\n \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n\f9 \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions  \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \n34. \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. Since 2002, WTE plants in the PRC have \nbeen  required  to  have  a  full  environmental  assessment.  The  sites  for  Dynagreen\u2019s  municipal \nWTE plants are selected in coordination with the respective municipal governments to minimize \nimpacts on the environment and nearby communities. Emission levels of major air pollutants are \nfound  to  comply  with  PRC  national  standards.  Dynagreen\u2019s  WTE  plants  meet  the  European \nUnion  2000  standard  for  dioxins,  which  is  10  times  more  stringent  than  the  PRC  national \nstandard. Fly ash is collected and cemented prior to disposal in a landfill. Bottom ash is reused \nin  various  ways  by  the  construction  industry. Wastewater  is  treated  onsite  and  is  both  reused \nand recycled. Land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation are expected not \nto be significant and, if needed, are normally carried out by the municipal governments. Since all \nsubprojects will be implemented in small and medium-sized cities, the project will not have any \nimpacts on ethnic minorities. \n \n35. \nDynagreen\u2019s  environmental  and  social  management  system  incorporates  measures  to \navoid,  minimize,  and  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  its \nsubprojects.  The  audit  of  Dynagreen\u2019s  implementation  of  its  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system is found to be satisfactory. Dynagreen\u2019s experience with its existing WTE \nplants  ensures  that  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  future  municipal  WTE  plants  will \nhave  adequate  mitigating  measures  and  monitoring  and  reporting  programs.  The  institutional \ncapacity  and  commitment  of  Dynagreen  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate and the company has committed to enhancing its environmental \nand  social  management  system  to  meet  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  To \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  Dynagreen  will  be  required  to \nprepare  an  initial  environmental  examination  and  a  resettlement  or  land  acquisition  planning \nreport for each subproject and submit these to ADB for review and approval, and implement the \napproved plans. Dynagreen will also be required to submit annual monitoring reports. ADB will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions requiring Dynagreen \nto  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures  (including  in  relation  to \ncontractors), in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.11 Dynagreen will be required \nto  report  to  ADB  on  compliance  with  such  measures.  A  no  gender  element  classification  is \nassigned for the proposed project.  \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\n36. \nDynagreen  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure \nincludes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\ninvestment  documentation \n\nInvestment Limitations  \n\nThe proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\n\n37. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.
