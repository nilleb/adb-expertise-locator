The  project  design  is  thus \nbased  on  least-cost  flood  mitigation  measures  coupled  with \nassistance  to  help  the  Government,  through  an  associated \ntechnical  assistance  (TA),  identify  and  initiate  medium-  to  long-\nterm comprehensive flood management. \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nfour \n\nflood \n\nfighting \n\nflood  zoning; \n\nflood-prone  areas \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  (i)  structural  measures  comprising  least-\ncost feasible solutions to protect villages and agricultural land on \nthe Araz, Ganikh, and Mazim rivers against floods, which occur on \naverage  once  in  10  years,  and  to  protect  other  areas  against \nfloods, which occur on average once in 50 years; (ii) nonstructural \nmeasures  constituting  pilot  community-based  afforestation,  flood \nforecasting  and  warning,  and \n(iii)  disaster \npreparedness  and \nfor  organizations,  physical \nfacilities, and residents through capacity building and procurement \nof  operation  and  maintenance  equipment;  and  (iv)  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring.  The  Project  will  cover  25  schemes \nin  12  districts \ninhabited \npredominantly by the poor. Poverty incidence in the project areas \nis 63% compared to 49% nationwide. \n \nMany areas are vulnerable to floods. They cause loss of life and \nproperty  and  reduce  income-earning  opportunities.  Impacts  are \nexacerbated by the inability of rural populations to afford personal, \ncrop,  and  livestock  insurance.  Floods  worsen  living  standards  of \nthe poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and can cause \nthe  non-poor \nfrom \nfloodwaters, the whole rural asset base is at risk in certain areas. \nFloods  not  only  threaten  settlements  but  also  leave  layers  of \nsediment  over  agricultural \nits \nproductivity.  Water  resources  control  and  management  are, \ntherefore,  the  critical  factors  underlying  efforts  to  promote  rural \ngrowth  and  raise  rural  incomes.  Improved  protection  provided  by \nthe  Project  will  not  only  secure  assets  but  will  also  allow \ndevelopment of knowledge to minimize flooding. \n\ninto  poverty.

Two PIUs will be established, one each at Sharur and \nSheki,  to  implement  works  in  Nakhchivan  and  greater  Caucasus \nareas,  respectively,  and  maintain  liaison  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration,  and  beneficiaries.  The  PMO  will  also  implement \nworks  in  Gusar  and  Astara  districts.  It  will  be  led  by  a  full-time \nproject manager, and the PIUs by deputy project managers. \n \nThe Project will procure machinery, civil works, services, vehicles, \noffice  equipment,  and  materials  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  45  person-months  of  international  and \n789 person-months of domestic consulting services to help SAIC \nmanage \ntender \nthe  Project,  prepare  detailed  design  and \ndocuments,  award  contracts,  and  supervise  construction.  The \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants,  using  the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  approval  of  advance  action  to \nrecruit  consultants  and  procure  equipment  and  civil  works  to \nexpedite  project  implementation,  considering  the  urgent  need  to \ncomplete the Project in 4 years.  \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  protection  to  5  major  towns  and  43 \nvillages, and support the livelihood of about 215,250 people living \non 76,790 ha of floodplains. The Project will enable communities \nto break out of the cycle of periodic asset replacement and move \nabove the poverty zone. This will be achieved by diminishing the \nrisk  and,  consequently,  losses  from  flood  damage,  and  by \nenhancing  development  opportunities  (e.g.,  higher  cropping \nintensities)  in  the  project  area  as  a  result  of  a  more  secure \nenvironment.  The  Project  will  prevent  average  annual  loss  of \n$4.83 million. Individual economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nfor 25 project schemes range from 11.3% to a 49.2%.

The  report  also  describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  River  Basin  and  Flood  Management \nPlanning, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nAt  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Azerbaijan,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  a  TA1  to  prepare  a  flood  mitigation  project.  The  project  preparatory  TA  (PPTA)  was \ncarried  out  from  February  to  August  2003.  This  document  is  based  on  consultants\u2019  reports; \nmissions\u2019  findings;  and  discussions  with  concerned  government  agencies,  potential  project \nbeneficiaries, and other external funding agencies. The project framework is in Appendix 1.  \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nAzerbaijan  has  a  population  of  8.11  million,  which  grows  at  0.38%  per  annum.  About \n56% lives in urban areas and 44% (about 3.6 million people) in rural areas. Life expectancy is \n72 years and the adult literacy rate is 97%. \n\n4. \nFrom  independence  in  1991  to  1995  the  country  experienced  considerable  political, \nsocial, and economic instability, one result of which was about 1 million refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons. Gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was only 44% of the 1990 level, and \nhousehold  expenditures  declined  by  50%.  In  1995  the  Government,  with  the  help  of  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank, \nto  achieve \nmacroeconomic stabilization, structural adjustment, and resumption of economic growth. These \nprograms  terminated  direct  credits  and  have  successfully  stabilized  the  economy.  The  budget \ndeficit has been reduced to less than 2% of GDP, borrowing costs cut to 7%, and inflation rate \nreduced  to  2%  per  annum.  GDP  has  increased  in  seven  successive  years  and  is  now  higher \nthan in 1990. Foreign exchange reserves amount to $1.2 billion. \n\ninitiated  several  programs \n\nADB2  notes  that  the  economy  continued  its  strong  growth  in  2002,  mainly  due  to  a \n5. \nrebound in foreign domestic investments in the oil sector. Since output growth resulted primarily \nfrom  an  increase  in  productivity,  wages  and  salaries  rose  substantially,  while  employment \nincreased  only  marginally.  The  average  wage  rose  by  20.3%  in  nominal  terms  (17.1%  in  real \nterms),  while  unemployment  is  reported  to  have  increased  from  1.2%  at  end-2001  to  1.3%  at \nend-2002. Results of recent labor market and household budget surveys, however, suggest that \ndespite the impressive economic growth of recent years, the actual unemployment rate remains \nat  15.8%  (14.2%  among  men;  18.6%  among  women).  Average  per  capita  income  is  $700. \nBased on the official absolute poverty line of equivalent to $24.5 per capita per month,3 some \n49% of the population is classified as poor. Using a relative poverty line of $14.7 based on 60% \n\n___________________________ \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Flood Mitigation Project. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2003. Asian Development Outlook. Manila.  \n3  This  is  based  on  the  cost  of  a  minimum  food  consumption  basket,  which  guarantees  a  daily  intake  of  2,200 \nkilocalories. The food share in the total minimum consumption basket is calculated at 70%, which corresponds to \nthe  actual  food  share  in  the  household  expenditure  structure  as  reported  in  the  Government\u2019s  household  budget \nsurvey results. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nof median per capita monthly consumption levels, about 17% of the population is classified as \nextremely poor. Poverty is more widespread in urban (55%) than rural areas (42%). \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nSector  Context.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy4  has  a  number  of \n6. \nelements  designed  to  make  income  distribution  equitable.  The  oil  sector  will  not  have  much \nimpact on rural income levels, and growth opportunities must be created in the non-oil sector. \nThe  agriculture  sector  is  the  primary  engine  of  rural  growth  but  is  highly  dependent  on  water \nresources control and management. Under Azerbaijan\u2019s climatic and topographic conditions, the \nability to manage water resources effectively and efficiently largely determines sector output and \nproductivity levels. Without well-managed irrigation facilities, crop yields have been halved, and \nwithout appropriate drainage systems, soils have become salinized and unable to grow crops. \nCrop production is highly dependent upon irrigation. Water losses are even higher than in the \nSoviet  period,  when  they  averaged  50%  of  supplies.  Higher  withdrawals  per  hectare  (ha)  are \nneeded  to  make  up  for  these  losses,  which,  in  turn,  overburden  systems  and  accelerate  their \ndeterioration.  Drainage  systems  were  never  adequately  developed,  and  salinization  appeared \nquickly  after  irrigation  networks  spread  in  the  1970s\u20131980s.  As  drainage  systems  failed,  the \nextent of heavily salinized areas doubled in the late 1990s. Tens of thousands of hectares have \nbeen  retired  in  Azerbaijan  because  they  no  longer  yield  crops.  A  detailed  water  sector \nassessment is in Appendix 2. \n\n7. \nRural  infrastructure  has  deteriorated  markedly  in  recent  years,  resulting  in  reduced \naccess  to  services,  lower  agricultural  productivity,  and  a  greater  risk  of  flood  damage  to \nsettlements and crops. While investment in physical infrastructure such as roads, irrigation and \ndrainage,  potable  water  supply,  power  supply,  telecommunications,  and  marketing  facilities  is \nessential to underpin rural growth strategies, investments in flood management are vital not only \nto protect these facilities and the associated settlement and agricultural lands but also to create \na secure environment to attract more investments. Thus, the Project will greatly facilitate rural \nand  agriculture  sector  growth  and  ensure  that  rural  populations  gain  secure  livelihoods  and \naccess to essential services. \n\nFlood Management. Floods generally occur in spring and early summer and are caused \n8. \nby snowmelt combined with heavy rainfall. Flooding is particularly acute in the greater Caucasus \narea, which is traversed by a series of hill torrents with steep slopes, causing high velocities and \nhuge amounts of bed-material movement. The catchment areas of these hill torrents vary from \nless  than  50  square  kilometers  (km2)  to  350  km2,  except  for  Goychay  (1,480  km2).  These  hill \ntorrents  are  generally  dry  or  have  insignificant  flow  during  the  non-flooding  season.  The \ntopography and hydrologic conditions of these hill torrents do not support feasible reservoirs to \nattenuate their short-lived flood peaks. The Araz and Ganikh, however, are perennial rivers with \ncatchment areas of more than 50,000 km2 each. They have multipurpose reservoirs built across \nthem  and  drain  into  the  Kur  River.  Samur,  another  perennial  river,  has  a  catchment  area  of \n3,620 km2. All rivers of Azerbaijan drain into Caspian Sea. \n\nMajor floods occurred in 1988, 1997, 1999, and 2002. Disastrous damage in the greater \n9. \nCaucasus  area  affected  public  buildings,  82  human  settlements  with  a  population  of  246,000, \n138,000 ha of cultivated area, 38 kilometers (km) of highway, 22 km of power line, 95 km of gas \n\n___________________________ \n4  State Programme for Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (2003-2005), approved Presidential Decree, \n\n20 February 2003. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\npipeline, and 65 km of irrigation canals and hydraulic structures. Average annual damage from \nfloods  over  1980\u20131990  is  estimated  at  $20  million.5  About  1.2  million  ha  are  prone  to  floods. \nThe value of business assets at risk from flooding is about $3.7 billion. \n\n10.  Many  areas  are  vulnerable  to  floods.  They  cause  loss  of  life  and  property,  and  flood \ndamage reduces income-earning opportunities. Impacts are exacerbated by the inability of rural \npopulations  to  afford  personal,  crop,  and  livestock  insurance.  Flood  protection  is  particularly \nimportant as the bulk of the rural population living in flood-prone areas has been rendered poor \nbecause  of loss  of  assets  and  has little capacity  to  rebound  after  losses.  Thus,  floods  worsen \nliving standards of the poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and can cause the non-\npoor to fall into poverty. Poor implementation of protected watershed area regulations results in \nillegal  tree  cutting  and  overgrazing,  leading  to  heavy  sediment  loads  after  floods,  seriously \ndiminishing agricultural productivity. Individuals and communities are also unwilling to invest in \nflood-prone areas. \n\n11. \nIn  1990  Azerbaijan  adopted  a  national  strategy  for  flood  protection  based  entirely  on \nstructural  measures.  The  approach  to  flood  management  is  so  limited  because  of  lack  of \ncoordination among agencies and absence of an interministerial coordination body.6 Because of \ndeep  involvement  in  structural  measures,  Azerbaijan  has  gained  invaluable  experience  in \ndesigning  and  constructing  flood  protection  walls,  and  many,  particularly  those  close  to  major \ncities,  have  been  properly  designed,  constructed,  and  maintained  and  are  still  serving  their \npurpose.  However,  examples  of  poor  construction  and  neglected  maintenance  are  also \nnumerous, and the huge fleet of machinery for river channeling and flood fighting has not been \nrecouped during the last couple of decades and is suffering from inefficiency, reduced capacity, \nand  increased  operational  costs.  The  inhabitants  of  flood-prone  areas consider structures  and \nchannelization as the most reliable flood protection measures. \n\nThe country has no concept of flood zoning. A law7 restricts encroachment on waterways \n12. \nand water bodies but only to protect water quality. Afforestation in watersheds\u20141,500\u20133,000 ha \nannually  nationwide\u2014consists  mainly  of  tree  planting  and  is  not  done  specifically  to  promote \nsustainability, reduce erosion, or improve the watershed hydrologic characteristics. The country \nhas no flood forecasting system, and the unreliable, ineffective flood warning system is based \non  voice  communication  from  some  ill-equipped  and  poorly  managed  hydrometeorological \nstations. \n\n13. \n\u201cDo nothing\u201d is clearly not the least-cost option and not acceptable. Leaving settlements \nand  croplands  at  risk  has  political,  economic,  and  social  consequences.  Politically,  such  a \nstrategy  would  only  highlight  how  rural  communities  receive  fewer  services  and  less  attention \nthan  urban  communities.  Economically,  analysis  of  the  project  area  concludes  that  the  likely \naverage  annual  cost  of  damage  is  about  $4.83  million.  Added  to  this  cost  is  the  foregone \ninvestment that would be made in the absence of risk to assets.  \n\nRelocating  settlements,  agricultural \n\n14. \nis  neither  socially \nacceptable nor economically feasible. In many parts of the world, watershed management has \nproved  effective  in  improving  rivers\u2019  hydrologic  characteristics,  including  reducing  flood  peaks \n\ninfrastructure \n\nlands,  and \n\n___________________________ \n5  World Bank. 2003. Water Resources in Europe and Central Asia. Washington DC. \n6   These agencies are State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, State \n\nCommittee for Land and Cartography, and Ministry of Fuel and Energy. \n\n7  Decree  56,  24  March  2000,  on  identification  of  water  protection  areas,  dimensions,  and  boundaries;  and \n\nmaintenance of protection lines. \n\n\f4 \n \n\nand sediment load, and stabilizing river channels. This option\u2019s success, however, is subject to \nagroclimatic  conditions  and  strict  enforcement  of  strong  legislative  instruments.  Above  all, \nwatershed  management  is  a  long  process,  requiring  more  than  a  decade  to  get  results.  Still, \nwatershed management may not completely solve the flood problem; some structural measures \nat  specific  locations  may  still  be  required.  Flood  zoning  is  a  nonstructural  measure  that \nregulates land use to minimize flood damage. However, flood zoning alone cannot provide flood \nprotection,  and  is  most  effective  when  combined  with  other  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures. \n\n15. \nThe  least-cost  solution,  therefore,  is  a  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures,  with  due  regard  to  the  local  conditions,  to  minimize  damage  and  implementation \ncost, which must be considerably lower than the saved cost of damage. \n\n16. \nInstitutional Context. The key agency associated with flood management is the State \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC), which manages all irrigation, drainage, and flood \ncontrol infrastructure and activities. SAIC has a number of departments that design, implement, \nand  manage  various  aspects  of  water  resources.  However,  the  departments  work  in  isolation, \nand an institutional arrangement to facilitate integrated water resources management is lacking. \nThe Government has thus requested ADB\u2019s assistance in this regard. \n\nAn irrigation systems department (ISD), subordinate to SAIC and the local government, \n17. \ncontrols  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  irrigation  and  flood  protection  facilities  in  each \ndistrict.  However,  a  more  holistic  view  of  flood  management  incorporating  nonstructural \nmeasures  requires  the  involvement  of  other  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and \nNatural  Resources  (MENR)  and  its  National  Meteorological  Department  (NMD)  as  well  as  the \nparticipation of affected communities. The Government has established the State Commission \nfor Emergency Situations to deal with disasters such as floods and drought but not to coordinate \nflood prevention or warning. \n\n18. \nSAIC\u2019s  2003  budget  is  about  $32.0  million,  of  which  about  $1.8  million  has  been \nallocated for flood protection in project districts, local staff salaries, equipment maintenance and \nuse,  and  flood  damage  repairs.  Allocation  is  about  50\u201360%  of  actual  requirements.  The \nGovernment does not charge specific fees for flood protection. Even for irrigation and drainage \nsystems,  the  irrigation  service  fee  covers  less  than  5%  of  SAIC\u2019s  total  irrigation  and  drainage \nbudget.8  The  low  level  of  cost  recovery  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  keep  costs  of \nagriculture  and  irrigation  to  the  farmers  to  a  minimum  until  they  can  afford  to  gradually  start \npaying higher fees. The Government has no plans to directly recover project investments from \nthe beneficiaries. \n\n19. \nGovernment  Plans  and  ADB  Operational  Strategy.  The  State  Program  on  Poverty \nReduction  and  Economic  Development,  approved  in  February  2003,  identified  a  number  of \npriorities  to  help  promote  economic  growth,  create  jobs,  and  reduce  poverty.  Particular \nimportance  is  attached  to  creating  jobs  in  the  non-oil  rural  and  agriculture  sectors,  which  are \nconsidered promising. However, they need investment in physical infrastructure such as roads, \nirrigation  systems,  potable  water  supply,  power  supply,  telecommunications,  flood  protection, \nand produce-marketing facilities. ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy is fully consistent with these \npriorities in its support for rural development and emphasis on physical infrastructure.  \n\n___________________________ \n8  World  Bank.  2003.

Washington DC. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nPolicy Dialogue. During project processing, the Government agreed to move away from \n20. \nthe  traditional  approach  of  structural  measures  for  flood  protection  and  to  consider  flood \nmanagement  as  a  component  of  holistic,  integrated  river  basin  management  with  strong \nbeneficiary  participation,  particularly  of  the  poor  and  women.  The  Government  agreed  to  (i) \ninclude nonstructural measures of watershed management, flood forecasting and warning, flood \nzoning, and capacity building for flood preparedness as project components; (ii) consult project \nbeneficiaries at all stages; (iii) engage local poor communities in afforestation and as unskilled \nlabor  for  civil  works;  (iv)  give  equal  employment  opportunities  to  women;  (v)  make  adequate \nresources  available  on  time  for  O&M  of  project  facilities;  and  (vi)  establish  a  river  basin  and \nflood management planning cell (RBFMPC) to initiate integrated river basin management. \n\n21. \nExternal  Assistance.  The  World  Bank  is  the  lead  agency  in  irrigation  and  drainage, \ndrinking  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  environmental  protection.9  Appendix 3  provides \ninformation  on  major  external  assistance  related  to  the  sector.  Other  multilaterals  include \nKreditanstalt  f\u1ee7r  Wiederaufbau  (KfW),  Islamic  Development  Bank,  and  European  Union.  The \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  Organization  for  Security  and \nCooperation in Europe, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have supported regional \nwatershed management. Some external funding agencies have also provided ad hoc assistance \nfor  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  flood  structures.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  would  be  the  first \nsystematic  assistance  to  reduce  flood  risk  and  simultaneously  provide  synergy  to  the \ninvestments by the other key agency, the World Bank.  \n\n22. \nLessons  Learned.  International  experience  suggests  that  floods  are  most  effectively \naddressed  using  an  optimal  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural  measures.  Structural \nmeasures  are  used  worldwide  as  the  most  effective  immediate  protection  from  floods,  and \nAzerbaijan has invaluable experience in designing walls to protect against hill torrents under a \nvariety of flow and sediment load conditions. The importance of sound watershed management \nhas  been  established  in  a  number  of  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  audit  reports.  Many \ncommunities  have  experienced  increasing  and  severe  flooding  after  storms  or  prolonged  rain \npartly due to denuded forested uplands and watersheds. Similarly, the sector synthesis of post-\nevaluation findings in the irrigation and rural development sectors pointed out how lack of proper \nirrigation  and  rural  development  projects.10  Flood \nwatershed  management  endangers \nforecasting and warning systems have established their usefulness during the last few decades \nand  are  now  being  used  to  efficiently  operate  water  resources  systems  of  Bangladesh,  India, \nMalaysia,  Pakistan,  Peoples\u2019  Republic  of  China,  Philippines,  and  a  number  of  other  ADB \nmember countries. Flood zoning is now an integral part of land-use planning in most developed \ncountries  and  is  becoming  increasingly  popular  among  developing  countries.  Post-evaluation \nexperience  in  flood  control  recommends  strengthening  integrated  river  basin  management. \nExperience  of  ongoing  World  Bank-financed  projects  in  Azerbaijan  suggests  that  projects \nshould (i) focus on one or few major activities; (ii) be flexible; and (iii) foster understanding and \nparticipation  of  all  stakeholders,  particularly  beneficiaries.  Projects  are  generally  on  schedule \nand  cover  areas  in  Sharur  and  Gusar,  where  local  agencies\u2019  capacity  has  been  found  to  be \nstrong. \n\nThe  Project  has  been  designed  on  the  basis  of  experience  of,  and  lessons  from, \n23. \nAzerbaijan and other countries. First, the overall design represents a balance between structural \n___________________________ \n9  The  Government  has  recently  requested  the  World  Bank  to  help  stop  serious  flooding  from  the  Kur  River.

Sector Synthesis of Post-Evaluation Findings in Irrigation and Rural Development. Manila. \n\n\f6 \n \n\nand  nonstructural  measures.  The  Azerbaijan  experience  has  guided  the  design  of  structural \nmeasures.  In  designing,  and  determining  the  scope  of,  the  nonstructural  measures,  due \nconsideration was given to immediate needs, the existing situation, local conditions, capacity of \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies,  and  what  can  be  reasonably  achieved  during \nimplementation.  Finally,  the  associated  TA  will  initiate  planning  by  using  the  concept  of \nintegrated river basin management. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n24. \nThe  project  objective  is  to  immediately  and  systematically  improve  security  against \nrecurring  floods  in  selected  areas.  The  Project  will  establish  and  support  sustainable  flood \nmanagement  infrastructure,  plans,  and  practices,  and  thus  significantly  reduce  recurring \neconomic  losses  and  help  increase  household  incomes  and  improve  living  standards  in  the \nproject area. About 63% of project area beneficiaries11 are below the poverty line. The Project is \nexpected to reduce the incidence of poverty to 57%.  \n\n25. \nThe  project  design  thus  focuses  on  least-cost  flood  mitigation  measures  coupled  with \ntangible assistance through an associated TA (para. 62) that will help the Government identify \nand initiate medium- to long-term comprehensive flood management. \n\n26. \nStarting with a list of 67 candidate flood protection schemes, the Government narrowed \nthem  down  to  27  for  PPTA,  excluding  the  floodplains  already  protected  by  embankments  and \nreservoirs, and the ones with committed funds. The consultant excluded from further study two \nschemes as they were downstream of a reservoir being constructed to have enough capacity to \nabsorb their flood peaks. For the remaining 25 schemes, the consultant confirmed the feasibility \nof  providing  flood  protection  using  the  criteria  of  historical  damage,  type  and  extent  of  threat, \nand potential for improvement. Thus, the Project will cover 25 schemes in 4 flood-prone areas in \n12  districts:  1  scheme  in  the  Araz  River  floodplain  in  Sharur,  Autonomous  Republic  of \nNakhchivan; 22 in 9 districts in the greater Caucasus area in the northwest; and 1 each in Gusar \nin the northeast and Astara in the southeast. While the greater Caucasus area is well known for \nflooding,  the  other  three  areas,  although  isolated,  offer  strong  justification,  including  higher \neconomic  returns,  for  their  inclusion  in  the  Project.  Sharur,  important  for  its  agricultural \nproduction and as a link for trade with Turkey, is threatened by floods from the Araz. Likewise, \nAstara is an important trade link with Iran, and floods from the Astara River threaten the safety \nof  the  bridge  on  the  highway  leading  to  Iran.  Flood  protection  in  the  Samur  River  in  Gusar  is \njustified to protect water resources projects funded by the World Bank and Islamic Development \nBank. Project districts are shown on the map. \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  project  components  are  structural  measures,  nonstructural  measures,  disaster \n\n27. \npreparedness and flood fighting, and project management and monitoring. \n\n___________________________ \n11 Poverty incidence is 49%. \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n1. \n\nStructural Measures \n\n28. \nThe  25  schemes  comprise  the  least-cost  feasible  solutions  to  protect  villages  and \nagricultural lands near the Araz, Ganikh, and Mazim rivers against floods occurring  on average \nonce in 10 years, and in other areas against floods occurring on average once in 50 years. The \nstructures\u2019  height  has  been  determined  by  providing  a  suitable  freeboard  over  the  estimated \nflood water level. The proposed measures will protect 5 major towns and 43 villages, covering \n76,790 ha and inhabited by 215,250 people. \n\nOn \n\nthe  Araz,  which  runs \n\n29. \nflood  protection  consists  of \nrehabilitation/construction of a 30 km embankment, with stone pitching in 10 km reaches which \nare under direct threat of erosion by an active channel too close to the embankment. \n\nthrough  a \n\nfloodplain, \n\n30. \nIn  the  case  of  hill  torrents,  structures  consist  of  the  shortest  feasible  protection  walls, \nvarying  from  50  to  2,690  meters  (m)  long  and  generally  on  one  side  of  the  active  channel  to \nprotect  specific  areas  without  constricting  the  flow,  altering  the  flow  regime,  or  aggravating \nflooding  upstream  or  downstream.  Protective  structures  include  concrete  gravity  walls,  stone \nconcrete walls, reinforced concrete walls, and stone filling. Selection of the type of structure for \na specific location was based on the least-cost solution, considering slope, velocity, discharge, \nquantity,  and  size  of  the  hill  torrents\u2019  bed  load,  and  availability  of  construction  materials.  All \ntogether,  the  38  protection  walls  in  22  schemes  in  11  districts  are  23.0  km  long,  while  stone \nfilling will be provided at two locations over 4.2 km. \n\n31. \nA list of the 25 schemes together with key design parameters and selection criteria is in \nAppendix 4. The total cost of the proposed structures, including the cost of a part of consulting \nservices for surveys, design, and construction supervision is estimated at $22.69 million. \n\n2. \n\nNonstructural Measures \n\nNonstructural  measures  constitute  watershed  management,  flood  forecasting  and \n\n32. \nwarning, and flood zoning. \n\na. \n\nWatershed Management \n\n33. \nDegradation of the catchments because of poor management during the last couple of \ndecades has led to higher flood peaks and larger sediment loads. To introduce afforestation as \na tool for long-term flood management, gully stabilization, and sediment control, the Project will \nset  up  a  pilot  scheme  for  community-based  afforestation  of  550  ha  of  degraded  areas  in  the \ncatchment of Kishchay hill torrent, where agroclimatic conditions are favorable and communities \nand  the  implementing  agency  are  already  familiar  with  and  involved  in  government-financed \nafforestation. Some nurseries have species suitable for planting in the pilot area. Of the 550 ha, \n275 ha will involve rehabilitation, and 275 ha, new afforestation. MENR\u2019s Forestry Development \nDepartment  (FDD)  will  be  the  subcomponent\u2019s  implementing  agency.  The  afforestation  target \nhas been limited to 550 ha, keeping in view the 4-year implementation period, and the fact that \nthis  is  the  first  project  of  its  type  in  the  country.  FDD,  with  project  consultants\u2019  guidance,  will \ndevelop  a  community-based  afforestation  program,  including  nursery  management.  As  trees \ntake  a  long  time  to  grow,  subcomponent  benefits  by  the  end  of  implementation  are  difficult  to \nquantify. Nonetheless, lessons and experience from this pilot project will be useful and can be \nreplicated  in  FDD\u2019s  afforestation  program  and  any  future  externally  financed  project.  The  total \nsubcomponent cost is estimated at $250,000. \n\n\f8 \n \n\nb. \n\nFlood Forecasting and Warning \n\ntorrents  and \n\ntelemetrically  connect \n\n34. \nAzerbaijan  has  no  flood  forecasting  system,  and  the  flood  warning  system  is  less \neffective  because  of  the  absence  of  meteorological  stations  at  2,000\u20132,500  m  altitude,  and \nmany  stations  and  telemetric  network  do  not  function.  To  develop  flood  forecasting,  improve \ndistrict administrations\u2019 warning capability, and facilitate earlier warning, the Project proposes to \nrehabilitate eight and establish five new meteorological stations in the catchment of the project \nhill \ntheir  respective  district  offices.  The \nthem \nmeteorological stations to be rehabilitated include Nakhchivan, Zagatala, Alibay, Sheki, Gabala, \nIsmailly, Quba, and Astara. They will be provided with barographs, hydrographs, thermographs, \nelectronic  barometers,  and  telemetric  systems.  The  new  stations  will  also  be  equipped  with \ntelemetric systems for automatic transmission of data and will be built at 2,000\u20132,500 m altitude \nin  the  catchments  of  Mazimchay,  Katekchay,  Talachay,  Kurmukhchay,  and  Kishchay  hill \ntorrents. NMD will help prepare specifications for procurement, evaluate the bids, and install the \nstations. They will be integrated into the NMD network for O&M. Using hydrometeorological data \ncollected from the network and an ADB-financed TA (para. 62), a suitable flood-routing model \nwill  be  selected  to  forecast  floods  and  guide  reservoir  operations.  The  total  cost  of  this \nsubcomponent is estimated at $250,000. \n\nto \n\nc. \n\nFlood Zoning \n\n35. \nFlood zoning is an important nonstructural measure, which, with hardly any investment \nin  physical  infrastructure,  helps  minimize  damage  even  from  extreme  flooding.  ADB  proposes \nthat the Government issue a resolution defining flood zones (such as prohibitive, restrictive, and \nwarning  zones)  and  specifying  land  uses  for  each.  SAIC  will  run  an  information  campaign  to \nraise  public  awareness  of  the  hazards  associated  with  land  uses  that  violate  the  resolution\u2019s \nregulations.  SAIC  will  also  be  required  to  demarcate  flood  zones  for  each  of  project  area \nriver/hill  torrent,  considering  existing  land  uses.  To  highlight  the  importance  of  flood  zoning  to \nmanage floods, the Government agreed to issue the resolution as a condition for loan effectivity. \nThe  Government  also  agreed  to  submit  to  ADB  a  time-bound  action  plan  to  implement  flood \nzones  in  the  project  area  rivers/hill  torrents  within  1  year  of  loan  effectivity.  SAIC  will  work \nclosely on flood zoning with ISDs, State Committee for Land and Cartography, and MENR. \n\n3. \n\nDisaster Preparedness and Flood Fighting \n\n36. \nTo  prepare  organizations,  physical  facilities,  and  residents  to  fight  floods,  the  Project \nproposes institutional streamlining, strengthening, and building capacity of SAIC and ISDs, and \nprocurement of O&M equipment. \n\n37. \nSAIC  will,  within  1  month  after  loan  effectivity,  establish  an  RBFMPC.  The  cell  will \ninitially  ensure  basin-wide  planning  and  management  of  water  resources  with  community \nparticipation;  assessment  or  water  resources;  and  development  of  a  strategic  planning \nframework,  national  water  policy,  and  cost  recovery  options.  Qualified  and  trained  staff  from \nvarious  SAIC  units  will  be  transferred  to  the  cell  and  their  capacity  enhanced  with  support  of \ninternational and domestic consultants provided under the associated TA discussed in para. 62. \nAs  the  capacity  of  the  cell  improves,  it  will  undertake  additional  associated  tasks  such  as \ncoordinating with international agencies; scrutinizing water resources projects, water allocation, \nand environmental protection and social measures; and addressing cost recovery. \n\n38. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  ISDs\u2019  O&M  capacity  by  providing  5  bulldozers  and  5 \nexcavators  to  maintain  the  active  river  channels  so  they  do  not  threaten  flood  protection  and \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nother important infrastructure and settlements. The total cost of this equipment is estimated at \n$1.76  million.  ISDs  will  use  their  O&M  staff  and  budget  to  operate  the  existing  and  new \nequipment and excavate 600,000 m3 during the first year, 1.7 million m3 during the second year, \nand 1.7 million m3 during the third year of implementation. \n\n4. \n\nProject Management and Monitoring \n\n39. \nThe Project will establish, and provide support to, the project management office (PMO) \nin SAIC, Baku; and two project implementation units (PIUs), one in Sharur, Nakhchivan, and the \nother in Sheki. Consultants will train, advise, and support PMO and PIU staff. A monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) unit will be established in the PMO within one month after the loan becomes \neffective  to  implement  the  environmental  monitoring  program  (EMP)  recommended  in  the \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE, Supplementary Appendix E) prepared under \nthe PPTA to monitor the Project\u2019s environmental and social impacts. Specifically, the M&E unit \nwill  (i)  collect,  collate,  and  analyze  baseline  data  on  economic,  social,  and  environmental \naspects within the project area; (ii) monitor benefits during project implementation; (iii) evaluate \nthe Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts within the selected systems; and (iv) \nmonitor  afforestation.  The  unit  will  particularly  monitor  (i)  income  opportunities  and  other \nresources  provided  under  the  Project  to  the  vulnerable,  poor,  and  women;  (ii)  reduction  in \nvulnerability  of  households  to  flood  damage;  and  (iii)  participation  of  women  in  community \nactivities. For environmental monitoring, data on the geography and morphology of active river \nchannels,  quality  of  water  and  soils,  and  groundwater  depth  and  quality  will  be  collected  and \nanalyzed. Project performance and M&E will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on \nproject performance management systems. The organization chart for project implementation is \nin Appendix 5. \n\n40. \nTo  monitor  the  Project\u2019s  social  and  poverty  impacts,  during  the  first  year  of  project \nimplementation  the  M&E  unit  will  compile  a  benchmark  database  to  provide  a  socioeconomic \nprofile of beneficiary communities. Key indicators will be tracked during project implementation, \nand  benchmark  and  project  completion  situations  compared.  The  total  cost  of  the  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  component  is  estimated  at  $0.868  million,  excluding  the  cost  of \nconsulting services. \n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n41. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $29.35 million equivalent, comprising $8.55 million \nin  foreign  exchange  (29%)  and  $20.80  million  equivalent  (71%)  in  local  currency.  Taxes  and \nduties included in the cost estimate are estimated at $1.03 million. The costs are summarized in \nTable  1  and  detailed  in  Appendix  6,  while  detailed  cost  and  financing  plan  tables  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n\nD. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n42. \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  equivalent  to  $22  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to \nfinance about 75% of the total project cost. The loan will finance the full amount of the foreign \nexchange costs estimated at $8.55 million, and about 65% of the local currency costs estimated \nat $13.45 million. The provision for local cost financing under the Loan is justified due to country \neconomic situation and project considerations. The bulk of ADB\u2019s local cost financing will be for \ncivil  works.  It  also  includes  local  consulting  services  (including  project  supervision  and \nmonitoring),  office  furniture  and  equipment,  and  recurrent  costs.  The  Government  will  provide \nthe remaining local currency costs estimated at $7.35 million equivalent. The Borrower will be \n\n\f10 \n \n\nComponent \n\nthe  Republic  of  Azerbaijan.

The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  make  counterpart  fund  allocations  to  SAIC  for  the \nProject on a grant basis. This is Azerbaijan\u2019s first ADB loan, and it will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n\n75  \n25  \n100  \n\n \n \n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\n44. \nSAIC  will  be  the  Project\u2019s  executing  agency,  and  the  SAIC  chair  will  be  designated \nproject director with overall responsibility for project implementation. A PMO will be established \nwithin  SAIC  to  manage  the  Project\u2019s  daily  activities,  and  to  liaise  with  ADB  and  coordinating \nbodies. The PMO will also implement project works in Gusar and Astara. The Nakhchivan and \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nSheki  PIUs  will  implement  the  Project  in  their  areas,  and  liaise  with  the  PMO,  local \nadministration, and beneficiaries. The PMO will be led by a full-time project manager, and the \nPIUs by deputy project managers. Key staff will be selected by a panel of experts appointed by \nthe Government and approved by ADB. Staff selected will need ADB\u2019s endorsement. \n\n45. \nThe  high-level  project  steering  committee  established  during  project  preparation  will \ncontinue  to  function  during  project  implementation  to  provide  policy  guidance  and  facilitate \ncentral interministerial coordination. A working group will be established to facilitate operational \ncoordination  of  interministerial  activities  at  the  district  level,  assist  the  PIUs,  and  coordinate \nactivities  involving  more  than  one  ministry.  FDD  will  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  pilot \ncommunity  afforestation  subcomponent  while  the  PMO  will  coordinate  with  NMD  to  prepare \nspecifications  and  evaluation  of  bids  for  procurement  of  meteorological  equipment.  The \norganization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 5. \n\nThe  project  will  be \n\n46. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n\nimplemented \n\nin  4  years  starting  April  2004.  The  project \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  costing  $500,000  equivalent  or  more  will  be \nawarded  through  ADB\u2019s  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Direct  purchase  will  be \nallowed for contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or less. \n\n48. \nCivil  works  contracts  costing  $1  million  equivalent  or  more  will  be  carried  out  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  those  valued  at  less  than  $1  million \nequivalent  will  be  carried  out  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nLocal contractors have the expertise, experience, and capacity to undertake these contracts. If \nworks\u2019 size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive bidding, and if the ISD \nhas the facilities and capacity to implement them expeditiously and at a reasonable cost, then \nADB may agree to force-account procedures. The upper limit for a force-account works package \nwill  be  $50,000.  The  award  of  all  civil  works  contracts  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The \nindicative list of the major contract packages is in Appendix 8, while the list of equipment to be \nprocured is in Appendix 9. \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n49. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  action  for  procurement  of \nequipment  and  civil  works  to  expedite  project  implementation.  Advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB, and advance procurement action will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  Government  was  informed  that  approval  of  advance \naction does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  finance  45  person-months  of  international  and  789  person-months  of \n50. \ndomestic  consulting  services  to  assist  SAIC,  in  project  management,  preparation  of  detailed \ndesign  and  tender  documents,  contract  awards,  construction  supervision,  and  M&E.  The \n\n\f12 \n \n\nGovernment will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  International  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  international  consulting \nfirms  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  while \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 10. The total \ncost of consulting services is estimated at $1.435 million. \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation  through  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds,  the \nGovernment will establish an imprest account promptly after the loan effectiveness with an initial \ndeposit of $1 million equivalent from loan proceeds. The imprest account will be established at a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \ndetailed  arrangements  agreed  on  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse \nexpenditures and liquidate the imprest account for payments, not exceeding $50,000 equivalent \nper  contract.  Force-account  work  procedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  expenditures  for  civil \nworks involving the use of Borrower\u2019s work force, equipment, and other resources. Although this \nwill be the first ADB-financed project to Azerbaijan, the Borrower is implementing a number of \nWorld Bank-financed projects and has acquired sufficient financial capabilities. \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n52. \nSAIC will submit brief quarterly and annual reports to ADB indicating progress made and \nproblems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy \nthe  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  following \nperiod.  Within  3  months  of  physical  project  completion,  the  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  a \ncompletion report providing details about implementation, costs, benefits, and other information \nrequested by ADB.  \n\n53. \nSAIC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  financial  statements,  which  will  be \naudited  annually  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the \nuse  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be  included  in  the \nannual  audit  report.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  an  audited  report,  together  with \naudited accounts and financial statements 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n\nAn  ADB-financed  study12  concluded  that  much  remains  to  be  done  to  align  Azerbaijan \n54. \naccounting  and  auditing  arrangements  with  international  practices,  and  that  internationally \ncompatible  arrangements  can  only  be  successfully  implemented  with  the  support  of  skilled \naccountancy  professionals.  In  view  of  this,  the  Chamber  of  Accounts  will  support  efforts  to \nimprove the Government\u2019s accounting and reduce corruption (para. 61). \n\n55. \nThe  Government  was  informed  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts, \nwhich covers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due date. If the \ndelay in submitting financial statement is more than 6 months, ADB will not issue a commitment \nletter  and  may  not  approve  new  contract  awards.  If  the  delay  is  more  than  12  months,  loan \n\n___________________________ \n12  ADB.  2002.

More  details  on  fiduciary \ncontrols are in Appendix 11. \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n56. \n\nThe Project provides for an elaborate system of performance M&E (paras. 39\u201340). \n\n57. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  the  Project  twice  yearly  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  the  Project  as  specified  in  paras.  39\u201340.  Particular  emphasis  will  be  given  to  project \nimplementation  monitoring,  including  (i)  implementation  status,  (ii)  design  and  construction \nstandards, (iii) physical progress and disbursements in relation to the implementation schedule, \n(iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  and  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants.  Detailed  technical  effectiveness  of  the  flood  mitigation  strategy  and  protection \nmeasures  will  be  assessed  during  midterm  review  proposed  during  the  second  year  of \nimplementation.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  this  review,  an  optimal  design  and  implementation \napproach will be identified for the remaining implementation period. The midterm review will also \nevaluate  (i)  project  progress,  including  design,  stakeholder  participation,  construction  quality, \nand possibilities of modifying the project scope; (ii) social and environmental impacts; (iii) future \nimplementation plans and targets; (iv) effectiveness of the project management structures and \nimplementation arrangements; and (v) institutional sustainability and progress on developing an \nadequate institutional framework. \n\n9. \n\nOperation and Maintenance, and Cost Recovery \n\nISDs  will  maintain  completed  civil  works,  and  O&M  of  project  machinery.  SAIC  will \n58. \nensure  availability  of  adequate  budgetary  resources  for  salaries  of  the  staff,  purchase  of \nrequired  materials,  maintenance  of  civil  works,  and  O&M  of  machinery.  FDD,  which  is \nresponsible for afforestation in the pilot area, will closely monitor the afforested project area for \nproper  upkeep  and  growth  of  trees  through  community  participation  management  after  project \ncompletion.  NMD  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  project  meteorological  stations  and  their \nintegration into the existing network. NMD will also ensure that data collected by these stations \nis readily available for flood forecasting and warning. \n\n59. \nThe  sustainability  of  flood  protection  infrastructure  depends  upon  the  quality  of  annual \nmaintenance.  The  additional  annual  O&M  cost  of  project  structures  is  estimated  at  $630,000, \nwhich  could  be  financed  by  (i)  increasing  the  SAIC  budget,  (ii)  using  the  current  SAIC  budget \nthrough  reallocations  as  the  additional  requirement  is  less  than  2%,  and  (iii)  adding  a  flood \nprotection supplement to the basic land tax in affected districts. Given the public-good nature of \nthe  benefits,  the  Government  has  assured  that  it  will  provide  resources  for  adequate  O&M  of \nproject facilities. The imposition of a surcharge to the basic land tax was considered but was not \nfound practical now. Project districts contribute about $1.2 million annually in land tax, which is \nlevied at a variable rate ranging from $1.50/ha to $12.00/ha depending upon the quality/value of \nthe land. This tax revenue is retained by the local authorities and is not used for flood protection. \nThe  land  tax  supplement,  if  imposed,  would  increase  the  average  annual  per  household \ncontribution  in  the  project  districts  from  $24  to  $32.  The  ability  of  households  to  pay  this \nincrease is questionable, since 63% are below the poverty line and the current land tax recovery \nrate is about 60%. Many farm households are also under pressure to pay increased charges for \nirrigation system O&M. The main source of income is produce, which is often consumed by the \nfamily.  Cash  income  may  be  as  low  as  30%  of  notional  family  income.  The  more  realistic \nstrategy  to  ensure  adequate  O&M  activity  would  be  to  increase  the  budget  and  community \nparticipation.  Beneficiary  communities  could  contribute  labor  if  the  responsible  agencies \n\n\f14 \n \n\nprovided  the  materials.  In  effect,  O&M  activities  would  become  an  extension  of  community \nparticipation in project implementation except that labor would no longer be wage earning. Flood \nprotection would increase the value of the land, which would result in higher taxation rates and \nthus  increased  revenue.  Cost  recovery  will  be  further  examined  under  the  associated  TA \n(Appendix 12). \n\n10. \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  concerned \n60. \ngovernment  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption  in  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and  contractors  to \nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed \ncontracts, and the sanctions for fraud and corruption. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed. \n\nA  comprehensive  anticorruption  program \n\n61. \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  overall  effort  to  enhance  governance.  To  this  end,  the  Azerbaijan  Accounting \nChamber\u2014Azerbaijan\u2019s supreme audit institution\u2014has been established. It has the authority to \naudit  all  government  bodies,  including  all  budgetary  and  extra-budgetary  organizations,  and \nfunds and will publicly report its findings. \n\nis  being  developed  as  part  of \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n62. \nAn associated grant-financed TA will be provided to help establish, and build capacity of, \nRBFMPC. It will initially ensure planning and management  of basin-wide water resources with \ncommunity participation; assessment of water resources; and development of strategic planning \nframework,  national  water  policy,  and  cost  recovery  options.  Flood  management,  short-  and \nlong-term protection planning, flood zoning, watershed management, selection of a flood-routing \nmodel to forecast and guide reservoir operation, and contingency planning to fight floods will be \nemphasized. The TA will develop the cell\u2019s capacity by providing hands-on training to staff. As \nthe  capacity  of  the  cell  improves,  it  will  undertake  additional  associated  tasks  such  as \ninstitutional streamlining, coordination with other ministries and international agencies, scrutiny \nof  water  resources  projects,  water  allocation,  and  environmental  protection  and  social \nmeasures. The cell could be a precursor of a neutral apex body mandated to manage national \nwater  resources.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $635,000  equivalent,  of  which \n$500,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA will finance the services of 12 person-months of international and \n44 person-months of domestic consultants. Details of the TA are in Appendix 12. \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n63. \nThe  Project  will  enable  communities  to  break  out  of  the  cycle  of  periodic  asset \nreplacement  and  move  many  households  above  the  poverty  line  by  diminishing  the  risk  and, \nconsequently,  the  losses  from  flood  damage,  and  enhance  development  opportunities  (e.g., \nhigher cropping intensities) as a result of a more secure environment. Out of 76,790 ha, about \n43,515 ha inhabited by 215,250 people comprising 44,350 households will directly benefit from \nthe Project. \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nThe  economic  analysis  is  based  on  measurable  benefits,  which  relate  primarily  to  the \n64. \nannualized cost of averted flood damage. The Project will prevent average annual loss of $4.83 \nmillion.  Improved  protection  will  also  allow  further  development  because  the  risk  to  such \ndevelopment  from  flooding  is  minimal.  Enhanced  development  possibilities  have  not  been \nanalyzed  in  detail.  Nonetheless,  the  key  elements  and  their  order  of  magnitude  deduced  from \nthe situation in adjacent but less vulnerable areas indicate that these investments will result in \nunmeasured  project  benefits  at  least  equal  to  those  that  have  been  measured.  Economic \nanalysis  of  the  Project  has  been  undertaken  based  on  constant  2003  prices  and  price \nrelativities, and using techniques that measure public investment efficiency. Economic costs and \nbenefits  were  estimated  using  border  prices  for  inputs  and  outputs.  Where  appropriate,  these \nprices have been prepared using World Bank commodity prices for May 2003. Local costs were \nestimated using financial data adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors. \n\n65. \nThe  most  widely  applicable  conversion  factor  used  in  the  analysis  is  the  standard \nconversion  factor,  which  represents  the  ratio  of  all  prices  in  the  domestic  economy  to  their \ninternational  comparators.  Using  the  weighted  average  of  import  and  export  tariffs,  excluding \nsubsidies,  the  standard  conversion  factor  has  been  calculated  as  0.95.  The  other  important \nconversion  factor  is  the  shadow  wage  rate.  In  rural  areas  underemployment  is  significant  and \nwage-earning employment highly seasonal. Therefore, the opportunity cost of unskilled labor is \nconsidered to be lower than the market rate. The shadow wage rate is estimated at 75% of the \nmarket  rate.  Skilled  labor  in  rural  areas  has  a  higher  market  rate,  and  wage  rates  are  much \nfirmer due to the shortage of technical skills outside urban centers. For skilled labor a standard \nconversion factor of 0.95 has been applied. \n\nProject benefits (averted flood damage) have been estimated in a number of steps. First, \n66. \nthe  types  of  assets  that  have  been  and  are  likely  to  be  damaged  were  divided  into  five \ncategories: crops, housing, infrastructure, other physical assets, and indirect damage. Potential \ndamage levels against flood design parameters for each category were determined per hectare  \nand then aggregated to give a composite value per hectare for all types of damage. Second, the \nper  hectare  value  was  multiplied  by  the  estimated  protected  area  to  give  a  total  value  of \npotential  damage  against  flood  design  parameters  for  each  scheme  and  for  the  Project  as  a \nwhole. The third step was to calculate the average annual cost of damage, taking into account \nflood frequency. Finally, the aggregate annual cost of damage (benefits) is matched against the \neconomic  costs  and  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  obtained  from  the  net  benefit \nstream. \n\nThe  economic  costs  of  project  implementation  have  been  derived  from  financial  costs, \n67. \ntaking  into  account  that  (i)  interest  during  construction,  price  contingencies,  and  taxes  and \nduties  were  excluded;  and  (iii)  local  financial  costs  were  converted  to  economic  costs  by \napplying  the  relevant  conversion  factors.  EIRRs  were  calculated  for  each  scheme  and  for  the \nProject as a whole. Individual EIRRs range from 13.3% to 49.2%. Only six out of 25 schemes \nhave an EIRR below 15%, and one below 12%. These schemes have been retained because (i) \nthey are a part of a cluster and their omission would be unfair, (ii) the EIRR shortfall is marginal \nand  far  outweighed  by  unmeasured  benefits,  and  (iii)  the  schemes  are  small  and  the  overall \nproject  EIRR  remains  extremely  robust.  The  base-case  EIRR  for  the  whole  Project  is  20.3%. \nThis  base  case  has  been  tested  against  cost  overruns,  reduced  benefits,  and  delayed \nimplementation.  A  10.0%  increase  in  costs  reduces  the  EIRR  to  18.2%.  A  10.0%  reduction  in \nthe price of wheat reduces the EIRR to 19.4%, and a 10.0% reduction in benefits reduces it to \n18.0%. The EIRR is reduced to 12% when investment costs rise by 53% or benefits fall by 35%. \nA combination of 10.0% increase in costs and 10.0% reduction in benefits reduces the EIRR to \n\n\f16 \n \n\n16.1%.  Thus,  the  project  EIRR  is  resilient  to  the  most  likely  causes  of  lower-than-expected \nperformance. Economic analysis details are in Appendix 13. \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Impacts and Social Development Strategy \n\n68. \nIn the project area, flooding is an important source of vulnerability. An estimated 215,250 \npeople  will  directly  benefit  from  the  Project  through  avoided  damage  to  44,350  houses  on \n43,515  ha.  About  79%  of  the  population  receives  less  than  $1  per  day  per  capita  per  month, \n63% have incomes below the official poverty line of $0.80 per day. About 16% of the population \nearns  only  $0.20  more  than  those  officially  classified  as  poor.  A  flood  can  easily  erode  this \nincremental income and make this segment of the population poor. The quantifiable benefits\u2014\naverage  annual  avoided  damage  of  $4.83  million\u2014translate  to  16%  of  average  annual  per \ncapita income and 6% of the annual per capita poverty threshold. The Project will also benefit \nthe  poor  through  reduced  damage  to  personal  property,  and  protection  of  livelihood  sources. \nBased on income distribution data from the household budget survey and the projected increase \nin  incomes  due  to  the  Project,  6.4%  of  the  population  will  benefit  from  increased  income  and \nclear  the  poverty  threshold.  The  Project  is  thus  conservatively  estimated  to  reduce  poverty \namong  beneficiaries  from  63%  to  57%  and  protect  16%  of  the  non-poor  population  from \nbecoming poor. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14 while the \nsocial and poverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n\n69. \nThe participatory approach was initiated during project design and is an ongoing activity \nthat will be further strengthened during project implementation. Participatory activities prioritize \nthe interests of the poor, women, and vulnerable groups. Community management is envisioned \nfor watershed management and flood protection structure maintenance, and will be facilitated by \ncommunity \nformation.  Contractors  will  hire \ncommunity  residents,  with  appropriate  representation  from  the  poor  and  women,  and  provide \nthem with skills to maintain the Project. \n\ntraining  and  community-based  organization \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  direct  and  indirect  benefits  to  the  poor  and  vulnerable \n70. \npopulation13  primarily  through  avoided  loss  to  life  and  property,  damage  resulting  in  reduced \nincome-earning opportunities, and foregone opportunities. Women will benefit through reduced \nflood-related  work,  project  jobs,  and  improved  living  standards.  The  Project  is  estimated  to \ngenerate 359,000 person-days of unskilled labor and will ensure employment of poor residents \nand equal opportunities and pay for women. The community watershed management program \nwill train residents, and raise their awareness of the need, to protect the watershed. The Project \nwill  facilitate  the  formation  of  community-based  organizations  for  watershed  management  and \nflood  protection  structure  maintenance.  The  Project  will  not  affect  indigenous  peoples  or \naffordability of goods and services. \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Monitoring \n\n71. \nAn Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was conducted for five project schemes, with \ntwo representing 22 subschemes in the greater Caucasus area.14 The IEE has concluded that \nnone of the project schemes are in environmentally sensitive areas, and the potential negative \n\n___________________________ \n13  Vulnerable  people  in  the  project  area  (internally  displaced  persons,  homeless,  female-headed/single-parent \n\nfamilies, orphans, and disabled persons) constitute 3.5% of the total population. \n\n14  The  project  schemes  in  the  greater  Caucasus  area  have  been  divided  into  two  groups  based  on  watershed \ncharacteristics: geology, geomorphology, soil type, climate, and vegetation. Kishchay hill torrent near Sheki (group \nA) and Damiraparanchay hill torrent near Gabala (group B) are the representative catchments. They are close to \nbig towns and could thus be subjected to maximum negative environmental impacts. \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nproject  impacts  on  the  environment  are  localized,  short  term,  not  significant,  and  can  be \nmitigated. Therefore, a full-scale environmental impact assessment is not needed. \n\n72. \nThe proposed structures will be constructed along the rivers/hill torrents on government \nproperty and so the Project will not be engaged in land acquisition. The Project, through various \nflood  management  measures,  will  help  reduce  human,  property,  livelihood,  and  environmental \ndamage. The Project will have a positive impact on the project area environment particularly on \nterrestrial habitats, by improving flood control capacity, reducing flood damage, and enhancing \nthe  local  environment  and  institutional  capacity  for  flood  control.  The  hill  torrents  bring  debris \nduring  floods,  covering  vast  areas  and  destroying  valuable  croplands.  While  protecting  these \ncroplands, the proposed structures will not obstruct river flows or flooding of unprotected, mainly \nwaste, land. Therefore, the measures are not likely to significantly reduce the benefits of floods \nsuch  as  groundwater  and  wetland  recharge,  and  addition of  soil  nutrients  to  wasteland,  which \nserves  as  pasture.  Afforestation  in  the  watershed  of  Kishchay  hill  torrent  will  help  check  soil \nerosion,  stabilize  gullies,  reduce  silt  load,  and  improve  hydrologic  characteristics  of  the \nwatershed,  and  thus  have  a  long-term  positive  environmental  impact  on  the  watershed  and \ndownstream  areas.  Flood  zoning  will  also  develop  awareness  regarding  safe  land  use  for \ndifferent  geographic  areas  and  thus  lay  the  foundation  for  proper  and  secure  land  use,  which \nwill have a long-term beneficial impact. \n\nConsidering that the project works are generally small and widespread, and that skilled \n73. \nand  nonskilled  labor  is  available  locally,  construction  camps  will  generally  be  small. \nNonetheless, attention will be paid to social discipline, education, and control and safeguards in \nwastewater and solid waste disposal. Erosion of unconsolidated material in areas with bare soil, \nsuch  as  embankments  and  construction  sites,  will  be  controlled  by  planning,  staged \nconstruction,  and  revegetation  to  minimize  areas  that  are  exposed  to  rainfall  for  any  length  of \ntime.  Careful  planning  and  enforcement  of  quality  control  procedures  during  construction  will \nensure  protection  of  workers\u2019  health,  avoidance  of  accidents,  and  control  of  environmental \npollution by noise and dust. \n\n74. \nAs per recommendation of the IEE, an M&E unit will be established in the PMO which, \namong  other  tasks,  will  implement  an  environmental  monitoring  program  and  recommended \nmitigation  measures  (para.  39).  Adequate  O&M  measures  must  be  used  to  control  negative \nenvironmental impacts. The Project has been designed not to have any negative impacts on the \nenvironment,  and  none have  been  identified.  The  Government  has  assured  implementation  of \nthe environmental management plan (EMP) developed during project processing, and mitigative \nmeasures  described  in  the  IEE.  A  summary  of  environmental  analysis  is  in  Appendix  15.  The \nsummary IEE and EMP are in Supplementary Appendixes E and F respectively. \n\nB. \n\nResettlement \n\nProtection  structures  will  be  on  the  banks  of  hill  torrents  or  rivers  and  have  been \n75. \ndesigned to avoid involuntary resettlement. Hill torrents do not have water year-round and are \nnot used as a resource in daily life. Project design ensures that structures will be built in areas \nnot used for residential or livelihood purposes and will have no impact on access or movement. \nIn perennial rivers, design of new protection structures has avoided potential displacement. No \nsquatters live on government land where structures will be located. PPTA consultants confirmed \n\n\f18 \n \n\nduring  their  visits  to  each  site  that  structures  will  be  built  on  government  land,  and  no  land \nacquisition is envisaged.15 \n\nC. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n76. \nThe  project  design  has  taken  into  account  a  number  of  risk  factors  whose  potential \neconomic impact has been assessed as part of the economic sensitivity analysis. All have been \nshown  to  have  modest  adverse  consequences.  The  main  risks  are  those  that  could  delay \nimplementation and benefits. The implementation schedule has been programmed to allow for \npossible disruption due to flooding. Although floods are short, key works will not be scheduled \nwhen flooding is a high probability. The  mild winters do not normally halt construction activity, \nbut heavy snowfall may slow down construction in some schemes.  \n\nThe Project has completed a significant amount of preparatory work. Subprojects have \n77. \nbeen  prepared  to  feasibility-level  designs  and  packaged  to  implement  many  small  individual \nschemes  in  parallel.  The  project  preparatory  unit\u2019s  tasks  include  advance  procurement  action \n(para. 49), which will ensure avoidance of initial implementation delays. \n\n78. \nA  further  risk  is  that  project  activities  may  not  be  fully  supported  locally.  PPTA \nconsultants thus worked closely with local agencies to select schemes and decide the nature of \nflood  mitigation  measures.  Local  authorities  welcomed  the  Project  as  it  will  relieve  them  of  a \nhuge  logistical  burden.  Finally,  the  risk  of  inadequate  O&M  of  project  facilities  is  addressed \nthrough  (i)  minimal  O&M  requirements  of  the  concrete  structures;  (ii)  development  of  strong \nbeneficiary  ownership  for  the  structures  through  an  information  awareness  campaign  that  will \nfacilitate early detection of potential problems and beneficiaries\u2019 undertaking minor O&M on their \nown; (iii) provision of O&M equipment; and (iv) government assurances regarding allocation of \nadequate O&M budget, and proper and timely maintenance of the structures. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and SAIC have given following, \n\n79. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nflood  damage, \n\n(b)  organize  community-based  groups \n\nThe Government will cause MENR to (a) conduct public awareness activities in the \nbeneficiary communities on the importance of watershed management and how it \nthe \nmitigates \nmaintenance  of  afforested  areas,  and  (c)  employ  labor  for  afforestation  from \namong  members  of  the  local  community  in  accordance  with  the  eligibility  criteria \nagreed on between the Government and ADB. \nThe Government will cause SAIC to conduct (a) an information campaign to raise \npublic  awareness  of  the  risks  and  hazards  associated  with  violation  of  land-use \nregulations in various flood zones as specified in the flood-zoning resolution (para. \n35),  and  (b)  public  awareness  activities  on  maintenance  of  flood  protection \nstructures. \n\nfor \n\n___________________________ \n15 Decree 56 (March 2002), to protect water quality, prohibits occupation or use of a minimum 50 m of land on both \nsides of the rivers.

Only  30%  of  the  country\u2019s  available  water  supply  is  generated  inside  its  borders. \nAvailable water resources average around 32.1 cubic kilometers (km3) per year, with high inter-\nyear variability. The largest rivers, the Kur and Araz, account for around 80% of total resources, \nand  their  catchment  area  covers  80%  of  the  country.1  Fresh  groundwater  reserves  are \nestimated at 4.2 km3. Substantial portions of available water resources are stored in reservoirs \n(total capacity of which is approximately 21 km3). The major reservoirs are committed to multiple \nuses,  chiefly  irrigation  and  hydropower,  and  also  serve  as  buffers  against  droughts  such  as \n2002. Abundant rainfall in 2002 necessitated emergency releases, flooding the lower reaches of \nthe Kur-Araz basin. \n\n2. \nSurface  water  quality  is  extremely  poor,  in  part  owing  to  upstream  industrial  pollution. \nThe  annual  discharge  of  pollution  from  Georgia  into  the  Kur-Araz  basin  averages  265  million \ncubic  meters.  The  Kur  and  Araz  also  carry  considerable  sediment  (estimated  at  60,000 \nmilligrams/liter at their confluence). Groundwater quality is generally adequate except in coastal \nareas where rising sea levels have increased the salinity of aquifers. \n\n2. \n\nUtilization \n\nWater withdrawals have grown by almost 25% since 1975, to around 16.5 km3 per year, \n3. \nsuggesting  that  only  51%  of  available  resources  are  withdrawn  annually.  Abstraction  from \nsurface sources comprises around 90% of water withdrawals. Withdrawals are expected to rise \nby a further 25% in the foreseeable future. Agriculture accounts for 70% of water withdrawals, \nfollowed by industry (25%) and households (5%).  \n\n4. \nAgriculture contributes approximately 20% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 41% of \nemployment. The command area of irrigation systems is around 1.45 million hectares (ha), 75% \nof  which  is  gravity  fed  and  the  balance  in  pumped  systems.  Most  irrigated  land  is  in  the  Kur-\nAraz basin, which also contains regions with a shortfall in drainage infrastructure. As irrigation \nand drainage infrastructure has been inadequately maintained since independence, conveyance \nlosses are estimated at 50\u201370%. Substantial areas went out of cultivation as irrigation systems \ncollapsed; the cultivated area in 2001 was 900,000 ha, of which 80% was planted to wheat or \ncotton. In 1999\u20132001 collective and state farms were broken up into 815,000 farm families, not \nall of whom can take full advantage of existing canals and drains. \n\n5. \nIndustry  contributes  33%  to  GDP  and  7%  to  employment.  Industrial  use  of  water  is \nmostly  for  electricity  generation,  cotton  processing,  and  canning  enterprises.  Rivers  provide \n91%  of  water  used  by  industry;  groundwater,  4%;  and  the  Caspian  Sea,  5%.  Only  6%  of \nindustrial water supply is drawn from on-site sources. Around 50% of households are served by \npiped  water,  principally  in  Baku  and  secondary  cities.  The  quality  of  piped  water  supplied \nappears  to  be  low.2  Water  quality  in  secondary  cities  and  rural  areas  is  difficult  to  assess \nbecause  testing  facilities  are  inadequate.  The  source  of  supply  in  rural  areas  includes  wells, \n___________________________ \n1  World Bank. 2003. Water Resources in Europe and Central Asia. Washington DC. \n2  World Bank. 2000.

Agriculture and hydropower have directly conflicting demands upon water resources. \nDaily  interruptions  in  electricity  supply  and  a  shortage  of  spare  parts  hinder  the  operation  of \npump  systems  (nearly  25%  of  the  total).  Pollution  from  industries  and  drainage  from  cropland \nworsen  water  quality  of  aquifers  and  wells.  Other  sectors\u2019  impact  has  eliminated  90%  of \nspawning  grounds,  while  pollution  threatens  fish  stocks.  Shipping  in  inland  waterways  has \nvirtually ceased to exist. \n\n7. \nWater-use  efficiency  in  all  sectors  is  low.  High  conveyance  losses  suggest  that \nagricultural water withdrawals per hectare could be reduced by rehabilitating infrastructure and \nmanagement. Industrial enterprises could reduce their water consumption by an estimated 30\u2013\n50% by reequipping and establishing sound management practices. Domestic water distribution \nsystems are rundown and water losses estimated at up to 50%. \n\nB. \n\nWater Resource Management  \n\n8. \nAzerbaijan  has  signed  numerous  international  agreements  concerning  water-related \nissues,  in  particular  with  Iran  and  Russia.  However,  joint  management  of  international  water \nresources  has  been  complicated  by  the  hostile  relationship  between  Azerbaijan  and  Armenia. \nThese  neighboring  countries  have  established  contacts  with  each  other  via  Georgia  to \ncooperate on technical issues. \n\n1. \n\nLegal Framework \n\n9. \nSince  independence,  the  country  has  started  to  address  requirements  for  improved \nnational water management, which include ownership of infrastructure and concept of payment \nfor  use  of  water  resources.  Water  management  institutions  are  required  to  implement  a  cost \nrecovery policy and empowered to deny supply to nonpaying customers. However, the legal and \nregulatory  framework  has  several  weaknesses,  including  (i)  legislation  and  regulations  are \ndeveloped  ad  hoc;  (ii)  lacunae  exist,  for  example,  concerning  the  legal  responsibility  for \nmultipurpose  dams;  (iii)  the  legislative  process  is  prone  to  influence  from  vested  interests;  (iv) \nmany laws, regulations, and acts do not ensure adequate transparency and remain vague and \nsubject to manipulation by officials; and (v) little of the legal and regulatory framework is widely \navailable to, and recognized by, the general public. \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Responsibilities \n\nA  number  of  national  institutions  are  involved  in  separate  aspects  of  water  resources \n10. \nmanagement.  However,  national  formal  procedures  to  plan  and  coordinate  water  resources \nmanagement are lacking\u2014a weakness the Government recognizes. \n\nIrrigation  and  Drainage.  The  most  powerful  water  management  body  is  the  State \n11. \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC), which manages the government-owned irrigation \nand  drainage  infrastructure  and  supervises  almost  all  irrigation  and  flood  control  activities.  An \nirrigation  system  department  (ISD),  subordinate  to  SAIC,  operates  in  each  district  and  is \nits \nresponsible \norganizational structure is outdated. The average irrigation water service charge is equivalent to \n$0.60 per thousand cubic meters. However, charges cover only 10\u201315% of the cost of operation \n\nfor  water  delivery.  SAIC\u2019s  operations  are  extremely  centralized  and \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nand  maintenance  (O&M).  SAIC  has  been  successful  in  fee  collection;  in  1998\u20132001  the \npercentage  of  paying  customers  rose  substantially,  from  25%  to  73%.  The  principle  of  cost \nrecovery is not applied to flood control structures. \n\nDomestic  Water  Supply.  The  management  of  domestic  water  supply  is  shared  by \n12. \nseveral  organizations,  primarily  51  district  utility  for  water  and  sewerage  operations  and \nmaintenance  operating  outside  of  Baku,  and  the  Apsheron  Regional  Water  Company,  which \nsupplies  water  to  greater  Baku.  Rural  communities  sometimes  supply  their  own  water  in \nconjunction  with  a  local  government.  Water-pricing  techniques  used  by  the  district  utility  for \nwater  and  sewerage  operations  and  maintenance,  introduce  substantial  distortions  by  not,  for \nexample, adequately accounting for the cost of debt service, uncollected revenue, maintenance \nexpenditures,  or  depreciation.  Under  the  tariff  structure,  industrial  enterprises  subsidize \nhouseholds. Fee collection of water utilities is poor. \n\n13. \nHydropower  Generation.  Hydropower  is  managed  under  the  auspices  of  Azenergo \n(under the Ministry of Fuel and Energy). Azenergo is responsible for O&M and capital repairs of \ninfrastructure on hydroelectric dams. The day-to-day management of Azenergo is centralized in \nthe same manner as SAIC. \n\n14. \nEnvironmental Aspects. The Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources has regulatory \nresponsibility  for  numerous  aspects  of  water  management,  including  natural  resource \nmanagement, pollution and water quality monitoring, and hydrometeorology.  \n\n15. \nDisaster  Response.  At  the  national  level,  response  to  disasters,  including  flood  and \ndrought,  is  the  responsibility  of  the  ad  hoc  State  Commission  for  Emergency.  Similar \ncommissions are established within local governments when necessary. Revision of the system \nfor  crisis  management  has  begun  with  assistance  from  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP). \n\n16. \nLocal  Government.  Local  government  plays  a  significant  role  in  water  management. \nThe  heads  of  local  governments  are  almost  always  consulted  before  the  appointment  of  the \nhead  of  a  local  branch  of  a  national  institution.  Local  governments  have  formal  authority  over \nwater utilities. \n\n3. \n\nInstruments and Resources for Management \n\nData  collection  and  monitoring  are  fragmented  and  underfunded,  with  results  rarely \n17. \nshared.  Planning  often  proceeds  as  before,  utilizing  outdated  standards  and  norms.  Financial \ncontrol is often lax, accounting remains based upon old standards, and application of financial \ninstruments such as water charges is nascent. Institution leaders are often unsuited to the new \ndemands being placed upon them, and most lack managerial acumen and have a weak service \norientation. \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Flood Mitigation Strategy and Targets \n\n18. \nIn upland areas spring, snowmelt, and rainfall cause hill torrents, some of which cause \nhighly  destructive  localized  flash  floods.  The  Government  estimates  the  annual  cost  of  such \ndamage at around $9 million. No comprehensive strategy for flood management exists. It would \nbenefit infrastructure, including transport and communications.  \n\n\f \n26\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nSupport to the Water Sector \n\n19. \nThe  World  Bank  is  the  leading  agency  in  the  water  sector,  with  approved  loans \nequivalent to $131 million to irrigation and drainage, urban drinking water supply and sanitation \nand  environmental  protection,  and  $45  million  more  in  the  lending  pipeline.  Other  multilateral \nagencies have financed infrastructure construction and rehabilitation. \n\n20. \nThe  ADB  is  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and \nEconomic  Development  and  has  initiated  the  poverty  reduction  partnership  process.  ADB  will \ndevelop  a  country  operational  strategy  emphasizing  (i)  integrated  and  sustainable  water \nresource  management,  including  enhancing  stakeholder  participation;  (ii)  improvement  of \nfinancial  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  water  sector  institutions;  and  (iii)  working  with  local \npeople  to  maintain  the  natural  environment.  Developing  policies,  institutional  frameworks,  and \ncapacities  of  central  and  local  governments  and  communities  to  apply  these  principles  will  be \naccorded  a  high  priority.  Specifically,  ADB\u2019s  sector  operational  strategy  might  include  the \nfollowing elements: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPromote  a  national  focus  on  water  sector  reform.  Support  the  creation  and \neffective  operation  of  a  neutral  apex  organization  to  provide  national  leadership \nin water sector reforms, including policy and legislation. \n\nFoster  integrated  management  of  water  resources.  Support  the  introduction \nof  management  on  the  basis  of  river  basins  or  main  hydraulic  units  as \nappropriate. \n\nFoster  water  conservation  and  service  delivery  improvement.  Rehabilitate \nirrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  to  return  land  to  cultivation  and  raise  rural \nincomes. Improve urban systems to reduce household and business expenditure \nand improve health. \n\nImprove  system  efficiencies.  As  public  sector  service  provision  is  inefficient \nand unsustainable, systems are deteriorating. Adopt market principles to pursue \nefficiencies, but temper them to ensure the rights of the poor to water. \n\nPromote  regional  cooperation.  Coordinate  closely  with  neighboring  countries \nto protect Azerbaijan\u2019s regional water interests. \n\nImprove governance. Establish viable public private sector partnerships based \non decentralized management in water service provision organizations. Study the \nrelationship  between  poverty  and  poor  water  management,  not  least  so  that \ninvestment impacts can be properly assessed. \n\n21.  Within this framework, future investments, to be confirmed and defined, will be governed \nby  the  need  to  (i)  provide  potable  water  and  irrigation  to  the  rural  population;  (ii)  mitigate  the \nimpacts  of  flash  floods  and  hill  torrent  erosion,  including  protection  of  the  upper  reaches  of \ntributary basins; (iii) provide assistance after natural disasters; (iv) provide controlled drainage of \narable  lands;  (v)  respond  to  local  water  management  priorities;  and  (vi)  help  mitigate \ngroundwater pollution. \n\n\fEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES SECTOR \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nFunding \nSource \n\nAmount \n(million) \n\nVIII.

International  consulting  services  have  been  kept  to  a  minimum  and  in \nareas  where  local  skills  are  not  adequate.  International  consulting  firms  in  association  with \ndomestic consulting firms will provide the services. Specific terms of reference for various fields \nof  specializations  follow.  Details  are  in  Table  A10.  The  total  cost  of  consulting  services  is \nestimated at $1.435 million. \n\nB. \n\nTeam  Leadership  and  Project  Management  (international,  22  person-months; \ndomestic, 84 person-months)  \n\n1. \n\nTeam Leadership \n\n2. \nThe team leadership group will be stationed in the project management office (PMO) at \nBaku  and  will  facilitate  coordination  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other \nagencies involved in design, and construction management and supervision. The group\u2019s main \ntasks will be as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nHelp PMO coordinate all matters related to project implementation with relevant \nministries,  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  design  institutes,  consultants \nhired  under  the  associated  technical  assistance,  local  administration,  ADB,  and \nany other associated organization. \nProvide  SAIC,  PMO,  and  PIU  staff  and  domestic  consultants  with  on-the-job \ntraining  in  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures,  efficient  project  management,  and \nscheduling techniques. \nHelp  the  PMO  program  project  activities,  estimate  the  financial  needs,  and \nfacilitate the timely release of required funds in adequate amounts. \nHelp the PMO ensure that (a) all periodic reports are prepared systematically and \nsubmitted  on  time,  and  reflect  the  real  picture  of  project  implementation;  (b) \nmajor issues relating to project implementation are brought to the attention of the \nconcerned parties; and (c) necessary remedial measures are implemented. \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment and Monitoring \n\n3. \nThe consultant will assess the environmental impacts of construction of flood protection \nstructures on cropping systems and agriculture uses, impact of backwater effect, change in river \nmorphology and flood regimes, physical impact on routine daily chores, and sustainability. The \nconsultants will also collect all data during the first 6 months of implementation for the baseline \nsurvey,  which  will  serve  as  an  indicator  of  the  situation  at  the  beginning  of  the  Project.  The \nconsultants  will  also  evaluate  the  requirements  for  environmental  monitoring  and  prepare  a \nlong-term environmental monitoring program at key flood protection sites. \n\n4. \nThe consultant will help PMO staff prepare an environmental assessment report for each \nscheme,  providing  information  on  baseline  environment  condition,  and  key  engineering \nindicators  that  have  environmental  implications.  The  report  will  also  identify  potential  adverse \nimpacts related to location, design, construction, and operation; and provide specific mitigation \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nmeasures  and  financial  sources.  A  monitoring  and  enforcement  program  will  be  developed  to \nensure that none of the schemes have any major adverse environmental impacts. If the result \nshows  that  the  scheme  under  evaluation  has  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts,  the \nconsultant  will  help  prepare  an  additional  study  or  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment, \nwhich  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  before  scheme  implementation.  The \nconsultant will also help in public consultation through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part \nof  environmental  assessment  for  each  scheme.  The  results  of  public  consultation  will  be \ndocumented and reflected in an environmental assessment report. \n\n3. \n\nSocial and Poverty Assessment \n\n5. \nThe  consultants  will  evaluate  social  issues  for  each  project  component  and  provide  a \nframework to maximize social and poverty benefits and provide monitoring indicators for social \nand poverty impacts. The consultants will collect baseline information during the first 6 months  \nof implementation, and provide training for periodic collection of indicators. The consultants will \nconduct stakeholder analysis, devise a participation strategy, and help the Government design \nmechanisms  for  community  participation,  particularly  for  the  watershed  component  and \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  flood  protection  structures,  including  design  of  plans  to \nraise public awareness. \n\n4. \n\nProject Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n6. \nThe  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialists  will  regularly  update  the  implementation \nprogress, compare it with the schedules, and provide feedback to the management on lapses, if \nany.  Particular  attention  will  be  given  to  participation  of  the  vulnerable,  poor,  and  women  in \nproject  activities.  The  specialists  will  also  work  very  closely  on  preparing  plans  with  various \ngroups  involved  in  project  implementation.  The  specialists  will  regularly  update  the  concerned \ngroups on critical activities and inform the groups of the implications of delays.  \n\nC. \n\nAfforestation  in  the  Pilot  Area  of  Kishchay  Watershed  (international,  3  person-\nmonths; domestic, 20 person-months) \n\nThe team will study the Kishchay watershed in detail, select the pilot area, and design an \n7. \nafforestation scheme (including nursery development) at the medium heights of the watershed \narea.  The  team  will  discuss  the  benefits  of  afforestation  with  local  communities  and  mobilize \nthem  to  participate  in  the  pilot  project.  The  Project  will  promote  social  forestry,  and  mobilize \nlocal communities to take part in watershed protection activities in the first 2 years of the pilot \nproject.  The  lessons  from  the  pilot  project  can  be  used  to  guide  future  large-scale \nimplementation.  \n\nD. \n\n Construction  of  Flood  Protection  Structures  (international,  20  person-months;  \ndomestic, 685 person-months) \n\n8. \nThe  consultant\u2019s  team  will  review  the  work  done  at  the  feasibility  stage;  arrange  and \nsupervise  further  field  surveys  and  investigations;  and  prepare  detailed  design,  conditions  of \ncontract, technical specifications, bills of quantities, and tender drawings for contract award. The \ndesign  team  will  be  based  at  the  PMO  in  Baku  and  coordinate  design  work  with  the  PIUs  at \nSheki and Sharur. Design activities for various work components will be as follows: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n41 \n\n1. \n\nFlood Management Activities \n\n9. \nThe works comprise design, award, and supervision of field surveys and investigations; \npreparation of detail design of flood protection structures; rehabilitation of flood forecasting and \nwarning system; and allied works: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfield  surveys  and \n\ninvestigations,  prepare  specifications  and \n\nFor \ndocuments, evaluate proposals, award contracts, and supervise the fieldwork. \nPrepare detailed designs for selected flood protection structures, prepare tender \ndocuments, prequalify contractors, evaluate proposals received, award contracts, \nand supervise construction works. \nPrepare a schedule for O&M of project flood protection facilities, and prepare an \noperations manual. \n\ntender \n\n2. \n\nProcurement and Contracting \n\nThe consultants will advise on procurement and contracting procedures, administration, \n10. \nand  management;  and  provide  on-the-job  training  to  PMO,  PIU,  and  SAIC  staff.  The \nprocurement and contracting tasks include the following: \n\nFamiliarize  project  staff  with  project  procurement  requirements,  including  ADB \nguidelines and procedures, and develop contracting capacity by providing on-the-\njob training. \nBased  on  the  procurement  requirements  of  the  project  components,  prepare \ndetailed  procurement  plans  and  packages,  and  determine  realistic  time-bound \nschedules  for  procurement,  including  parallel  and  sequential  steps  to  complete \nprocurement activities from initial planning to delivery of goods and services. \nDevelop  a  contract  management  system  to  ensure  that  records  and  data  are \nstored systematically and cross-referenced with the project financial accounts. \n\n3. \n\nConstruction Management and Supervision \n\nThe  tasks  of  the  construction  management  and  supervision  group  will  include  the \n\n11. \nfollowing: \n\nSupervise  and  monitor  implementation  of  civil  works,  including  preparation  of \nprogress  reports  and  maintenance  of  records  related  to  the  contracts  and  civil \nworks, etc. \nMonitor  fieldwork,  issue  early  warnings  as  soon  as  targets  are  deemed  to  be \nmissed, and coordinate remedial measures. \nCertify withdrawal applications and keep accounts for the loan. \nProvide  overall  guidance  to  the  project  staff  and  contractors  regarding  quality \ncontrol and conformity of the works with contract provisions. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nExpertise \n\nTable A10: Consulting Service Requirements \n\nPerson-Months \nInternational  Domestic\n\nTeam Leader/Construction Management Specialist \n\nA.

These  provide  information  on  project  description,  objective,  source  of \nfinancing,  loan  amount,  terms  of  the  loan,  and  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  be  used  to \ndisseminate  information  to  the  public.  Briefs  will  also  provide  lists  of  services,  equipment,  and \nmaterials  to  be  procured  and  information  about  their  benefits.  Briefs  will  be  published  in \nnewspapers and posted in the project management office (PMO) and project implementing units \n(PIUs),  which  will  also  act  as  contact  points  for  further  information.  The  information  will  be \nupdated quarterly. \n\n84. \nStakeholder  Workshops.  Periodic  national  and  local  workshops/community  meetings \nwill  also  be  used  to  disseminate  information.  The  workshops  will  be  used  to  gain  the \ncommitment  and  support  of  agencies,  and  gain  political  and  bureaucratic  support.  Notices  for \nsuch  meetings  will  be  published  in  national  and  local  newspapers  and  posted  at  municipality \nbuildings, schools, and hospitals. \n\nB. \n\nImplementing Best Practices \n\n85. \nThe  Project  will  implement  best  practices  on  fiduciary  controls,  progress  monitoring, \nfinancial  management,  and  governance  as  described  below.  An  elaborate  program  of  project \nmanagement staff training and closer supervision will be emphasized. \n\nFinancial  Management.  To  harmonize  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  activities,  the \n86. \nfinancial  management \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  benefit \nassessments.  The  World  Bank  has  two  ongoing  projects  in  Azerbaijan,  with  the  State \nAmelioration and Irrigation Committee (SAIC) as Executing Agency. \n\nfrom  World  Bank \n\nExecuting  Agency.  The  World  Bank  has  assessed  financial  management,  indicating \n87. \nthat SAIC is fully capable of meeting World Bank project accounting and reporting requirements. \n\n88. \nExternal Audit. For the World Bank projects, SAIC agreed to submit, within 6 months of \nthe end of each fiscal year, audited financial statements in line with the international accounting \nstandards  promulgated  by  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants.  The  EA  has  already \ncomplied with this covenant, no significant issues have arisen, and auditing arrangements and \nfindings  were  found  to  be  satisfactory.  The  cost  of  the  audit  is  being  financed  from  project \nproceeds. \n\n89. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report on Observance of Standards \nand  Codes,  lack  of  external  audit  is  a  major  weakness  in  Azerbaijan.  The  August  1999  law \nestablished the Accounting Chamber to perform the function of external audit, but the provisions \nof  the  law  are  very  weak.  The  accounting  chamber  is  also  too  small  to  perform  its  required \ntasks. The report also states that the external audit of annual accounts is fundamental to assure \nthe integrity of fiscal data. \n\n90. \nLearning  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  and  IMF\u2019s  experience,  the  Project  proposes  that  the \nselection  and  appointment  process  for  auditors  be  in  line  with  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Finance by the Asian Development Bank.  \nGiven  the  weak  structure  of  domestic  audit  firms,  the  Project  proposes  to  recruit  a  foreign-\nassociated audit firm and has included audit costs in the project costs. \n\n91.  Management  Information  System.  The  PMO  will  use  a  multi-currency  and  multi-\nlanguage  bookkeeping  software  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting.  The  software  will  have \nthe  capacity  to  undertake  (i)  general  accounting  and  reporting  to  the  local  authorities,  and \n(ii) project  accounting  and  presenting  project \nfinancial  statements  and  statements  of \nexpenditures to ADB. \n\n92. \nProcurement. The World Bank has conducted a comprehensive review of procurement, \nincluding  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  capacity,  and  enforcement  regime. \nAssessments are summarized below: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAzerbaijan  has  introduced  the  Public  Procurement  Law,  based  largely  on  the \nUnited Nations Commission for International Trade Law model. The law has set \nup a three-tier review system that consists of an internal administrative review by \nthe State Procurement Agency (SPA) and judicial review. \nThe  courts\u2019  ability  to  deal  with  procurement  disputes  is  poor,  thus  jeopardizing \nSPA\u2019s level of confidence and overall transparency in the review process. \nSPA  has  been  vested  with  procurement  regulatory  functions  and  shown  its \nwillingness to ensure compliance with the Public Procurement Law. \nSPA  has  competent  and  well-trained  staff.  The  country,  however,  lacks  a \nplanned training system for procurement. \nThe World Bank has assessed Azerbaijan as a medium- to high-risk country from \nthe procurement perspective and stated that an increased level of supervision by \nstaff is required to mitigate the risk. \n\nLearning from the World Bank\u2019s assessment, the Project will undertake the following to \n\n93. \nimprove financial management: \n\nIn  the  project  administration  memorandum  to  be  prepared  at  project  inception, \ngive details of each component and steps for project implementation along with \nthe role and responsibilities of PMO and PIUs. \nPrepare  a  training  plan  for  PMO  and  PIU  staff  and  update  it  annually.  This \nprogram  will  include  modules  for  training  in  ADB\u2019s  disbursement,  procurement, \nand financial management. \nUse  a  multi-currency  and  multi-language  bookkeeping  software  for  accounting \nand financial reporting. \n\nProgress Monitoring. Project implementation and progress monitoring will be combined \n94. \nwith project management staff training and conducted through an increased number of review \nmissions,  which  will  include  technical  experts  and  other  financial  and  thematic  specialists  as \nrequired. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \nA. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \nSUPPORTING RIVER BASIN AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT PLANNING \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n1. \nThe  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  capacity  building  of  a  river  basin  and  flood \nmanagement  planning  cell,  which  will  be  created  in  the  State  Amelioration  and  Irrigation \nCommittee (SAIC)\u2014the institution responsible for developing and managing water resources\u2014\nwithin  1  month  after  loan  effectivity.  The  cell  will  initially  ensure  basin-wide  water  resources \nplanning  and  management  with  community  participation,  water  resources  assessment,  and \ndevelopment of strategic planning framework and national water policy. Particular emphasis will \nbe  given  to  comprehensive  flood  management  involving  development  of  short-  and  long-term \nflood protection planning; promotion of nonstructural measures, including development of flood \nforecasting;  and  river-routing  models  and  their  use  in  reservoir  operation,  flood  zoning,  and \ncontingency  planning  for  flood  fighting.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  provided \nunder the TA will help the cell conduct these tasks and, in the process, develop their capacity to \nundertake  similar  and  other  related  tasks independently  after  TA  completion.  These  additional \ntasks  will  include  institutional  streamlining,  coordination  with  other  ministries  and  international \nagencies, scrutiny of water resources projects, water allocation, environmental protection, social \nmeasures, and cost recovery. The cell could be a precursor of a neutral apex body mandated to \nmanage national water resources. The cell will report directly to the SAIC chair and be staffed \nby qualified and trained specialists from various units of SAIC. \n\nB. \n\nConsultants \n\n2. \nThe  TA  will  require  a  total  of  12  person-months  of  international  consultants,  and  44 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. The following breakdown of consultancy requirements \nis indicative and subject to revision at the consultant selection stage, allowing one specialist to \noccupy more than one position. The proposed international consultants include (i) a team leader \nand  river  basin  planning  and  policy  development  specialist  (5  person-months),  (ii)  water \nresources  institution  and  community  development  specialist  (3  person-months),  and  (iii)  flood \nmanagement  specialist  (4  person-months).

Of the \n25 schemes, 22 are along the southern slopes of the greater Caucasus mountains in the north \nof  the  country,  which  is  drained  by  the  Ganikh  River  and,  subsequently,  Kur  River.  The \nremaining  three  schemes  are  on  the  Samur  River  along  the  border  with  Russia,  on  the  Araz \nRiver in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and on the Astara River in the southeast. The total \narea  protected  from  flooding  will  be  76,790  hectares  (ha).  The  structural  features  will  be  a \ncombination  of  embankments  (about  30  kilometers  [km])  and  different  types  of  stone  and \nconcrete walling (about 23 km). \n\nB. \n\nApproach to Economic Analysis \n\n2. \nProject  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  using  techniques  to  measure  public \ninvestment efficiency. Economic costs and benefits were estimated using prices that reflect their \nreal  value.  Major  traded  goods  have  been  valued  at  border  prices,  and  local  costs  estimated \nusing financial data adjusted by the appropriate conversion factors.  \n\n3. \nThe  most  widely  applicable  conversion  factor  used  in  the  analysis  is  the  standard \nconversion  factor  (SCF),  which  represents  the  ratio  of  all  prices  in  the  domestic  economy  to \ntheir  international  comparators.  Using  the  weighted  average  of  import  and  export  tariffs, \nexcluding subsidies, the SCF has been calculated at 0.95. \n\n4. \nThe other important conversion factor is the shadow wage rate. Rural underemployment \nis  significant  and  salaried  employment  highly  seasonal.  Therefore,  the  opportunity  cost  of \nunskilled  labor  is  considered  to  be  lower  than  the  market  rate.  The  shadow  wage  rate  is \nestimated at 75% of the market rate or AZM9,165/day. Skilled labor in rural areas has a higher \nmarket  rate,  and  wage  rates  are  much  firmer  due  to  the  relative  shortage  of  technical  skills \noutside urban centers. For skilled labor the SCF of 0.95 has been applied. \n\n5. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  based  upon  constant  2003  prices  and  price  relativities.  The \nprofitability  of  the  proposed  investment  has  been  measured  by  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) and net present values. The exchange rate used to determine border prices has \nbeen taken as AZM4,900 to $1. \n\n6. \nThe economic analysis is based upon the measurable benefits, which relate primarily to \nthe  annualized  cost  of  averted  flood  damages.  The  enhanced  development  possibilities \nresulting from greater protection levels have not been analyzed in detail, but the key elements \nand their order of magnitude may be deduced from the situation in adjacent but less vulnerable \nareas.  First,  agricultural  productivity  will  markedly  increase  during  the  5  years  after  project \ncompletion  due  to  a  shift  from  cereals  to  more  intensive  cash  crops,  in  response  to  reduced \nproduction risks. The value of agricultural output may be expected to increase by at least 30% \nduring the first 5 years after project completion and to maintain this level during the project life. \nSecond, land will shift from agriculture to infrastructure, especially housing and small enterprise \ndevelopment.  Unit  area  asset  values  for  housing  are  more  than  10  times  those  of  agricultural \nland. A conservative expectation is the transfer of land use from agriculture to infrastructure at \n1.5% per annum during the project life. Finally, these developments will require an expansion of \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n50 \n \n\npublic sector services (water supply, power, roads, and telecommunications), which will further \nincrease  unit  area  asset  values.  Taken  together,  these  investments  are  estimated  to  result  in \nunmeasured project benefits at least equal to those which have been measured. \n\nThe  estimates  of  averted  flood  damage  have  been  determined  in  a  number  of  steps. \n7. \nFirst,  the  types  of  assets  that  have  been  and  are  likely  to  be  damaged  were  divided  into  five \ncategories: crops, housing, infrastructure, other physical assets, and indirect damage. Potential \ndamage  levels  against  flood  design  parameters  for  each  of  these  categories  were  determined \nper  hectare  and  then  aggregated  to  give  a  composite  value  per  hectare  for  all  types  of \ndamages. Second, the per hectare value was multiplied by the estimated protected area to give \na total value of potential damage against flood design parameters for each scheme and for the \nProject as a whole. The third step was to calculate the average annual cost of damage, taking \ninto  account  flood  frequency.  Finally  the  aggregate  annual  cost  of  damage  (benefits)  was \nmatched  against  the  economic  costs  and  an  EIRR  obtained  from  the  net  benefit  stream.  The \nfollowing sections describe the above steps in more detail. \n\nC. \n\nProject Economic Costs \n\nProject economic costs were estimated in three steps. The basis of the calculation is the \n\n8. \nfinancial costs of each scheme phased during construction.  \n\n9. \nThe conversion of financial costs into economic costs has taken account of the following: \n(i)  interest  during  construction  and  price  contingencies  were  removed,  (ii)  taxes  and  duties \nexcluded,  and  (iii)  local  financial  costs  converted  to  economic  costs  by  applying  the  relevant \nconversion factors to labor and material costs. The total project economic costs are estimated at \nAZM124.2 billion. \n\nD. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n10. \nThe calculation of project benefits is based on estimates of the cost of flood damage to \nexisting  assets  that  will  be  saved  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  These  include  growing  crops, \nhousing, roads/railways, and other infrastructure such as power lines and telecommunications. \nThe potential inundation area (where these assets are vulnerable) has been determined by field \nsurveys using topographic maps. \n\n11. \nThe  ADB  guidelines  on  economic  analysis  of  projects  recommend  12%  as  the \nopportunity cost of capital unless nonmeasurable benefits are significant. The Project has large \nnonmeasurable benefits that would justify the inclusion of a subproject at a marginally lower rate \nas long as the overall project EIRR remains well above the opportunity cost. The nature of the \nworks  means  that  partial  flood  protection  benefits  will  accrue  during  project  implementation  (4 \nyears).  The  economic  life  of  all  schemes  is  taken  as  25  years  although  the  physical  life  of \nproject works will comfortably exceed this timeframe, assuming adequate maintenance.  \n\nE. \n\nEconomic Prices of Inputs and Outputs \n\n12. \nThe valuation of measurable benefits is based on the use of border prices for inputs and \noutputs.  International  border  prices  for  wheat  and  fertilizers  have  been  estimated  using  World \nBank  Commodity  Prices \ntransport, \npackaging/storage, and handling charges to give a farm-gate valuation. For other commodities, \nfinancial prices adjusted to the farm gate and by the SCF of 0.95 have been used. The derived \n\nfor  May  2003.  These  have  been  adjusted \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nfarm-gate  prices  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  are  shown  in  Tables  5  and  6  of \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n\n13. \nCrop damages for each scheme were calculated based on crop budgets for the  crops \ngrown in a particular area. Budgets were prepared for all crops in each scheme. For each crop, \nthe  revenue  received  and  costs  incurred  were  calculated  during  the  period  preceding  each \nmonth  of  the  growing  season.  The  potential  crop  loss  from  floods  for  each  month  was  then \ncalculated as potential revenue minus the costs that have been incurred up to the time of flood \noccurrence.  The  results  for  all  crops  were  then  aggregated  and  weighted  according  to  the \ncropping  pattern.  The  monthly  totals  were  then  weighted  according  to  the  probability  of  flood \noccurrence  in  that  month  using  the  flood  frequency  as  the  baseline.  The  weighted  monthly \nvalues  of  crop  damage  were  then  summed  to  give  a  total  value  of  potential  crop  losses  per \nhectare. Tables showing these calculations are in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n14. \nFlood damage estimates for housing and infrastructure were calculated based upon the \nincidence  of  particular  infrastructure  in  each  scheme  and  the  cost  of  replacement  of  that \ninfrastructure.  The  Project  will  affect  44,350  houses.  Replacement  cost  varies  according  to \nbuilding  material  used.  Potential  damage  cost  per  hectare  reflects  housing  density  and  type. \nInevitably, the range of values is wide, reflecting the incidence and size of settlement. The per \nhectare cost of potential damage to housing at the scheme level ranges from $100 to $7,400. \nObviously,  schemes  with  substantial  settlements  will  have  a  much  higher  cost  than  those \ninvolving rural villages. The average per unit area cost for the whole Project is about $4,200/ha. \n\n15. \nA  similar  calculation  has  been  undertaken  for  roads/railways.  Within  the  project  area \napproximately  726  km  of  asphalt  roads,  1,222 km  of  gravel  roads,  and  11  km  of  railroads  are \nvulnerable  to  flooding.  Individual  scheme  costs  range  widely,  with  the  main  towns  naturally \nhaving a much higher value than rural villages. The average cost across the Project is $396/ha. \n\nOther direct costs of inundation include damage to irrigation and water supply networks, \n16. \npower  supplies,  telecommunications,  and  livestock.  Usable  data  on  these  items  are  not \navailable.  A  sample  of  schemes  were  surveyed,  including  those  with  the  highest  and  lowest \nincidence of these assets. Actual damage incurred during the most recent flood was also taken \ninto  account.  This  approach  concluded  that  the  potential  cost  of  damage  to  these  assets  is \napproximately  10%  of  the  combined  cost  of  estimated  damage  to  crops,  housing,  and \nroads/railways.  Accordingly,  a  factor  of  10%  has  been  added  to  these  costs  in  each  scheme. \nThis low estimate reflects the low incidence of such assets in some scheme areas and their low \nvulnerability to flood damage due to the nature of their construction. \n\n17. \nFlooding is also associated with indirect costs relating to disruption caused to everyday \nactivities  such  as  trading  (local  markets  and  small  businesses)  and  the  immediate  costs  of \nclearing  and  cleaning  affected  areas.  In  the  absence  of  data,  these  indirect  costs  have  been \nassessed at 5% of total direct damage for each scheme.  \n\n18. \nThese various estimates of potential flood damage costs per hectare are summarized in \nTable 12 of Supplementary Appendix H, and converted into an estimated total value of potential \nlosses  against  flood  design  parameters  using  the  inundation  areas  for  each  scheme.  The \nestimated  aggregate  potential  losses  against  design  parameters  for  the  Project  as  a  whole  is \n$36 million. On the basis of the hydrological data, zero damage is equated to a flood period of \n2.33 years.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n52 \n \n\nThe estimate of potential total losses has been converted into expected average annual \n19. \ndamage  in  any  given  year  for  all  levels  of  inundation.  The  proposed  flood  works  provide  full \nprotection against the design floods. Average annual damage (annualized benefits) are derived \nby plotting total damage against flood frequency. \n\n20. \nThese  average  annual  damage  or  baseline  benefits  are  expected  to  increase  in  real \nterms  following  project completion,  after  4  years.  Annual  benefits  are assumed  to  increase  by \n3% per annum for 6 years until the 10th year of the Project. Thereafter, benefits are assumed to \nremain constant in real terms. This is a very conservative assumption, taking into account the \nexpected  period  of  protection  in  most  areas  and  the  likelihood  that  growth  opportunities  will \nincrease substantially.  \n\nF. \n\nEconomic Feasibility \n\n21. \nThe  economic  feasibility  of  the  individual  schemes  and  of  the  Project  as  a  whole  has \nbeen  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  and  net  present \nvalue using the discounted cost-and-benefit flows over a project life of 25 years. The base-case \nEIRRs for individual schemes range from 11.3% to 49.2%. Only six schemes out of 25 have an \nEIRR of less than 15% and only one has an EIRR of less than 12%. These schemes have been \nretained because (i) they are part of a cluster and their omission would be unfair, (ii) the shortfall \nin the EIRR is marginal and far outweighed by unmeasured benefits, and (iii) the schemes are \nsmall  and  the  overall  project  EIRR  remains  extremely  robust.  The  base-case  EIRR  for  the \nProject as a whole is 20.3%. The project EIRR calculation is in Supplementary Appendix H. The \nProject will benefit the agriculture, household, and public sectors. \n\nG. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n22. \nThe  base-case  results  have  been  tested  for  their  resilience  against  a  number  of  risks, \nincluding  cost  overruns,  reduced  benefits,  and  delayed  implementation.  The  results  of \nconventional  sensitivity  analysis,  using  single-point  values,  for  the  whole  Project  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n\nA 10% increase in total costs reduces the project EIRR to 18.2%. A 10.0% reduction in \n23. \nthe price of wheat reduces the EIRR to 19.4% and a similar reduction in total benefits reduces it \nto  18.0%.  A  combination  of  10.0%  increase  in  costs  and  10.0%  reduction  in  benefits  reduces \nthe EIRR to 16.1%. A one-year delay in implementation reduces whole-project EIRR to 16.9%. \nThe EIRR is reduced to 12% when investment costs rise by 53% or benefits fall by 35%. The \nanalysis also looked further at the impact of implementation delay, quality of construction, and \ninadequate funding for maintenance. The quality of construction and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance funding was simulated by assuming that the Project would attract no benefits after \n20  years  and  after  15.  A  combination  of  one  year  delay  in  benefits  and  zero  benefits  after  20 \nyears reduces the project EIRR to 16.0%, and the same combination with zero benefits after 15 \nyears reduces the project EIRR to 13.6%. Thus, the project EIRR is resilient to the most likely \ncauses of lower-than-expected performance. \n\nH. \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n24. \nBased  on  the  economic  and  financial  analysis,  a  distribution  analysis  was  undertaken. \nAgriculture will benefit from avoided crop damage; households, from avoided property damage; \nand  the  public  sector,  from  avoided  damage  to  public  infrastructure.  During  construction, \nunskilled labor will benefit from jobs. Table A13 provides the results of the distribution analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\nTable A13 indicates that approximately 85% of project benefits accrue to households, farmers, \nand the private sector in the project area. Households capture about half the project benefits. In \ncontrast, project costs will be met from public sector spending. The distribution of project costs \nand  benefits  among  project  stakeholders  suggests  the  need  for  a  review  of  the  cost  recovery \npolicy  on  flood  protection,  particularly  measures  that  increase  cost  recovery  from  those  who \nbenefit  the  most  from  the  Project.  This  aspect  will  be  addressed  under  the  associated  TA \n(Appendix 12). The design and implementation of such policies must have a sound basis and be \ntransparent to the concerned communities. \n\nTable A13: Distribution Analysis \n(AZM million) \n\nFinancial \nNPV \n\nBenefits and Cost/ \nProject Stakeholder \n \nBenefits:  \n Farmers (agriculture sector)  \n Households (private sector)  \n Public Sector  \n Labor  \nCosts:  \n Public Sector: project investment costs  \n Public Sector: O&M Costs  \nNPV =  net present value, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n78,566 \n113,194 \n29,544 \n4,755 \n \n106,266 \n4,755 \n\n \n \n\nEconomic \nNPV \n\n \n \n74,638 \n107,534 \n28,067 \n3,373 \n \n97,137 \n3,373 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n54 \n \n\n \nA. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis/Poverty Partnership Agreement \n\n \nOne  of  six  key  strategies  of  the  Government\u2019s  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic  Development \n(2003\u20132005)  is  to  improve  infrastructure  for  the  poor.  Infrastructure  has  been  identified  as  a  national  priority  in  the \ndraft poverty partnership agreement, which was discussed with the Government in May 2003 and will be finalized after \nconfirmation of the poverty reduction targets. \n\n \nThe Project covers 12 districts and will benefit 215,250 people (57% urban and 43% rural) in 5 towns and 43 villages. \nOf the total project area of 76,790 hectares (ha), about 43,515 ha or 57% involve settlements while remaining is the \nagricultural area. The Project will primarily reduce the vulnerability of the poor and enhance their security, particularly \nconsidering  the  lack  of  personal,  crop,  and  livestock  catastrophe  insurance  or  reinsurance  schemes.  Floods  could \nfurther lower living standards of the poor, negate any progress in reducing poverty, and cause the non-poor to fall into \npoverty.  Physical  infrastructure  and  nonstructural  measures  will  protect  lives;  reduce  damage  to  property,  livelihood \nsources, and social services; and provide stability required for investments and economic growth.  \n\n \n\nB. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\nProposed Classification: Pro-Poor \n\n \nWhile  project  area  residents  have  high  (although  deteriorating)  degrees  of  access  to  housing,  basic  education,  and \nprimary  health  services,  high  levels  of  unemployment  and  low  wages  result  in  widespread  poverty.  Based  on  the \nparticipatory  rapid  assessment  and  on  interview  surveys,  63%  of  the  project  area  population  is  estimated  to  have \nincomes less than the absolute poverty threshold of AZM120,000 per capita per month (or $0.80 per person per day at \n2003  exchange  rates);  more  than  half  the  poor  live  in  extreme  poverty,  with  monthly  per  capita  incomes  below \nAZM72,000 (or $0.48 per person per day). A large proportion of the population is poor, and of the non-poor, 16% have \nincomes not exceeding 25% of the poverty line.  \n \nWhile the implementation of the government poverty reduction strategy is expected to reduce poverty in the long term, \nthe  project  area  is  highly  vulnerable  to  floods.  Particularly  in  the  northwest,  it  has  always  been  under  the  threat  of \nfloods  and  sediments.  Over  the  last  10  years,  of  the  40  most  devastating  floods,  25  occurred  in  the  project  area. \nEnvironmental risks from flooding constitute an important source of vulnerability.  \n \nThe Project is expected to generate significant job opportunities and income for beneficiaries. The Project is estimated \nto generate 359,000 person-days of unskilled labor, of which at least 300,000 are envisioned to be for the poor. The \nProject will increase disposable income by reducing costs for rehabilitating personal property from flood damage. The \nProject will protect 44,350 houses and an area of 76,790 ha. Most houses (82.3%) in the affected areas are made of \nlocal materials, and although restoration costs are lower than the value of cement block houses (AZM43.7 million vs. \nAZM58.0  million),  the  probability  of  damage  with  each  flood  is  also  higher  for  houses  made  from  local  materials. \nRestoration depletes household savings and assets. Aside from monetary expenditures, households have opportunity \ncosts from foregone economic and social activities during restoration of damaged property.  \n \nBased  on  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  average  avoided  annual  damage  to  personal  property  and \ninfrastructure  is  AZM23.60  billion  ($4.83  million).  Prevention  of  crop  damage  and  loss  of  livestock  are  particularly \nbeneficial  to  the  rural  poor,  who  depend  mainly  on  these  for  livelihood.  Flood  protection  will  also  reduce  damage  to \nimportant social infrastructure and prevent disruptions to vital social services such as schools, clinics, and hospitals; \nutilities such as electricity; transport; and markets. The project area has 79 kindergartens, 114 schools, 29 clinics, and \n11  hospitals  that  are  threatened  by  floods.  Estimated  avoided  damage  translates  to  an  average  of  AZM85,000  per \ncapita per year to project beneficiaries, which is 16% of the average annual per capita income and 6% of the annual \nper capita poverty threshold. \n \nThe estimated income increases due to the Project will reduce poverty incidence from 63% to 57%. About 79% of the \npopulation  who  receive  less  than  AZM150,000  per  capita  per  month  (approximately  $1  per  person  per  day  at  2003 \nexchange  rates)  will  gain  from  the  Project.  With  incomes  just  $0.20  per  person  per  day  more  than  those  officially \nclassified as poor, this segment of the population could easily become poor after a flood. With the Project, however, \nincome will be less vulnerable to the adverse effects of flooding; and income increases will secure revenue streams, \npreventing the non-poor from sliding to poverty.  \n \nOther potential project benefits include an expected increase in investments due to reduced risk of crop failure, which \nmay  encourage increased cropping. More investments and efficient use  of land  would improve  yields, diversify rural \nincome,  and  enhance  household  income.  With  the  threat  of  crop  failure  due  to  flooding  reduced,  farmers  will  be \nencouraged  to  cultivate  more  profitable  crops.  Access  to  land  has  been  important  in  protecting  the  rural  population \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nfrom poverty, but land use has been mainly for subsistence farming. The Project could also have other benefits such \nas possible industrial and infrastructure development because it will be protected, resulting in more jobs; higher urban \nand agricultural property values; enhanced environmental benefits from the watershed management component; and \nincreased  participation from the community  in management of reforested areas and maintenance of flood protection \nstructures. \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \nMeetings  were held  with local officials and other stakeholders to raise awareness and gain local support. Interviews \nand  surveys  were  conducted  among  project  beneficiaries  to  obtain  their  views  and  opinions  for  project  design  and \nimplementation. The participatory approach was initiated during project design and is an ongoing activity, which will be \nstrengthened  further  during  project  implementation.  The  interests  of  the  poor,  women,  and  vulnerable  groups  have \nbeen prioritized in participatory activities. Key areas for community participation are discussed below. \n \nCommunity  Watershed  Management.  A  pilot  project  for  afforestation  in  the  Kishchay  watershed  to  control  soil \nerosion is proposed as a project component. The implementing agency will be the Forestry Development Department \n(FDD)  under  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Natural  Resources.  The  component  will  finance  the  cost  of  nursery \ndevelopment, planting, and partial cost of cultivation (staking, watering, weeding, and pruning). Watershed protection \nwill involve the community in planting and maintaining reforested areas.  \n \nFDD  will  develop  a  watershed  management  plan  for  550  ha  in  Kishchay,  involving  nursery  management  and \nafforestation through community participation. Implementing the 275 ha afforestation requires 100 persons employed \n8 months a year (March to October) for 5 years rehabilitation will require 30 persons employed for the same duration. \nTo  facilitate  community  participation,  residents  of  Kish,  the  community  closest  to  the  watershed,  will  be  trained  and \nemployed in afforestation. Nursery management for sapling production should become more efficient, and eventually a \nprivate  sector  activity,  with  small  nurseries  developed  closer  to  reforestation  sites  and  run  by  the  community. \nReforestation will involve men and women equally.  \n \nAfforestation  will  ensure  employment  of  community  residents  and  organization  of  the  community  to  manage  the \nwatershed.  This  will  be  done  in  three  stages.  First,  residents  will  be  trained  in  reforestation.  Then  FDD  will  conduct \nenvironmental  awareness  activities  on  the  importance  of  watershed  management  in  mitigating  flood  damage,  and \nhighlight  the  value  of  community  participation  in  ensuring  sustainable  development.  Finally,  FDD  will  organize \ncommunity  groups  and  build  their  capacity  to  maintain  reforested  areas.  The  community  groups  will  ensure \nrepresentation from all sectors, particularly the poor and women.  \n \nBuilding  Community  Capacity  to  Maintain  Flood  Protection  Structures.  Communities  can  be  taught  to  manage \nflood  protection  structures.  The  participatory  rapid  assessment  confirms  that  beneficiaries  have  an  understanding  of \nthe  Project  and  its  potential  benefits  to  households  and  the  community.  Beneficiaries  have  signified  willingness  to \nparticipate in project activities by contributing unskilled labor for construction.  \n \nTo develop skills to operate and maintain flood protection structures, the State Amelioration and Irrigation Committee \n(SAIC), the Executing Agency,  will  ensure that contractors employ local  people to develop their skills,  which can be \napplied  during  operation  and  maintenance.  Contractors  will  discuss  hiring  unskilled  labor  with  local  municipality \ngovernment  officials  and  village  leaders.  SAIC,  in  close  coordination  with  and  support  from  local  governments,  will \nimplement  an  awareness  program  to  build  an  environment  conducive  to  forming  a  network  of  community  groups  to \nmaintain flood protection structures.  \n \n \n \nD. \n\nGender Development \n\n  \nThe participatory rapid assessment shows that women in the project area are equal to men in literacy, social image, \nhousehold prestige, access to resources, and management skills. Women are as visible as men in most occupations. \nAgriculture is the major economic activity in the project area, and women engage in most operations such as sowing, \nweeding, hoeing, harvesting, and storing crop produce. Backyard livestock raising, dairy production, and nursery and \norchard operations are dominated by women. During floods, women and men have equal roles in restoration. \n \nThe  Project  will  give  women  more  time  for  biomass  collection,  cooking,  cleaning,  child  care,  and  crop  and  livestock \nraising. The watershed management component will give women the same opportunity as men to participate in, and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n56 \n \n\nE. \n  \n\nbe  paid  for,  services  provided.  Of  the  22,000  person-days  for  afforestation,  11,000  are  envisioned  for  women. \nContractors will also employ women in administrative and other work required to build flood protection structures.  \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone  \nNone \nNone \n\n \n \n \n\nResettlement \nAffordability \nLabor \n\n \nPlan Required \n\nNone \nNo \nNo \n\nNot Significant  Civil  works  to  build  flood  protection  structures,  and  the  pilot \nsocial forestry component are expected to generate many jobs \nand  raise  incomes  for  project  beneficiaries.  Strategies  will  be \nemployed  to  seek  positive  externalities  to  employ  the  poor. \nConstruction technology is  labor intensive, providing unskilled \nlabor opportunities for project area communities paid at market \nrates.  The  Project  is  estimated  to  generate  359,000  person-\ndays  of  unskilled  labor,  of  which  at  least  300,000  are \nenvisioned to be for poor residents. Women will be employed. \nIndirect  job opportunities  during construction as  well  as  direct \nand  indirect  job  benefits  from  operation  and  maintenance  of \nflood  mitigation \nof \nand \nnonstructural measures are anticipated. \n \n \n\nimplementation \n\nstructures, \n\nNone \n\n \n\nNot Significant  Vulnerable  persons  (internally  displaced  persons,  homeless, \nfemale-headed/single-parent  households,  orphans,  and \ndisabled  persons)  constitute  only  3.5%  of  the  project  area \npopulation.

This summary IEE describes the Project and baseline environmental conditions of the project \narea,  analyzes  the  environmental  benefits  and  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts,  and \noutlines recommended mitigation and monitoring measures. \n\n2. \nAs  each  scheme  under  the  structural  measures  component  will  be  designed  during \nproject  implementation,  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has  been  developed  to \nguide  the  environmental  assessment  of  schemes  with  structural  measures  and  facilitate \ninstitutional  arrangements  and  compliance  with  environmental  requirements  of  Azerbaijan  and \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The EMP specifies the type of schemes to be assessed; \nthe  procedure  of  environmental  assessment  to  be  carried  out  (including  responsibilities, \nfor  environmental  assessment,  and  environmental  criteria  of  scheme \nprocedure \nimplementation);  and \ninstitutional  arrangement  and  monitoring  program  during  project \nimplementation. The EMP is provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\n3. \nThe Project takes a comprehensive approach to flood control and prevention, including \nnonstructural (watershed management, flood forecasting and warning, and flood zoning) as well \nas  structural  interventions.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  structural  measures, \n(ii) nonstructural  measures,  (iii)  disaster  preparedness,  and  (iv)  project  management  and \nmonitoring. \n\nThe Project will cover the four areas regularly devastated by floods from rivers and hill \n4. \ntorrents:  Araz,  greater  Caucasus,  Gusar,  and  Astara.  Of  25  schemes,  22  are  in  the  greater \nCaucasus  area,  and  1  each  in  Araz,  Gusar,  and  Astara.  Flood  protection  consists  of \nrehabilitation/construction of 30.0 kilometers (km) of embankment with stone pitching in 10.0 km \nreaches under direct threat of erosion on the Araz River, and stone pitching covering 4.2 km in \nthe  Ganikh  River.  The  structures  proposed  for  hill  torrents  include  38  protection  walls  in  22 \nschemes with a total length of 23 km. The proposed measures will protect five major towns and \n43 villages, covering 76,790 hectares (ha) inhabited by 215,250 persons. The total project cost \nis estimated at $29.35 million. The Project is planned to start in early 2004 and be completed in \n2008. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical and Ecological Resources \n\n5. \nIn the greater Caucasus area, hill torrents have gravelly sandy beds with slopes of 1:8 in \nthe western and central part, and 1:20 in the eastern side. The main rock groups are limestone, \nsand  stone,  clayey  shales,  and  clays.  Average  annual  rainfall  ranges  from  760  to  950 \nmillimeters  (mm).  In  Araz,  the  arid  climate  is  harsh,  with  very  hot  summers  (up  to  43  \u00b0C)  and \nvery cold winters (down to\u201330\u00b0C). The average annual rainfall is about 220 mm. In Gusar, the \nwatershed  area  of  the  Samur  River  is  of  volcanic  origin,  and  the  soils  are  mountain  meadow \nbrown. Temperatures range from \u201328\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, with approximately equally distributed rainfall \nof 570 mm annually. In Astara, the rocks are of volcanic origin and the main types of soils are \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n58 \n \n\nmountain meadow, yellow, and meadow. The climate is subtropical. Temperatures range from  \n\u201313\u00b0C to 36\u00b0C. Average annual rainfall is 1,280 mm. \n\n6. \nThe  wildlife  resources  in  the  project  area  are  scarce.  Vegetation  cover,  together  with \nhuman  disturbances,  provides  a  few  habitat  variations  in  feed,  shelter,  and  protection.  Rare \nspecies, including snow leopard, brown bear, and Caucasus deer, are practically extinct.  \n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Conditions and Quality of Life Values \n\n7. \nProject  area  residents  earn  their  livelihood  mostly  from  agriculture  and  rain-fed \ncultivation.  The  main  crops  grown  in  this  area  are  wheat  and  maize.  A  significant  part  of  the \narable land is under orchards. The project area does not have any major industry, while some \nsmall-scale  processing  factories  exist.  Livestock  production  has  been  increasing  rapidly  since \nindependence  and  is  now  fundamental  to  the  agro-pastoral  system.  Sheep,  goats,  cattle,  and \nbuffalo constitute the main wealth of the rural population. Production of wool is substantial and \nmuch  of  it  is  exported.  The  poor  in  the  project  area  are  more  protected  than  the  urban  poor. \nPublic  health  in  five  project  areas  is  affected  mainly  by  drinking  water  supplies.  Public  health \nfacilities,  including  sanitation,  are  generally  in  good  shape.  Water-borne  diseases  are  not \nprevalent in any of the four project areas, where people have access to basic school education. \nHowever, recreational facilities are very limited.  \n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n8. \nThe proposed structures will be constructed along the rivers/hill torrents on government \nproperty  so  the  Project  will  not  be  engaged  in  land  acquisition.  No  scheme  will  be  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas.  Workers  will  be  trained  to  follow  environmental  and  safety \nregulations  and  to  use  the  best  available  practice  to  minimize  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction  and  operation.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment, \nparticularly terrestrial habitats, by improving flood control capacity, reducing flood damage, and \nimproving the local environment and institutional capacity for flood control.  \n\n1. \n\nAraz  \n\n9. \nThe Project will construct a 30 km embankment with stone pitching in 10 km reaches on \nthe Araz River. Most of the Project comprises rehabilitation of existing embankment. Where no \nembankment  exists,  a  new  embankment  will  be  constructed.  The  proposed  embankment  will \nprotect large agricultural and populated areas from flooding while still keeping enough velocity \nand waterway not to cause sediment deposition that will raise the riverbed and flood upstream \nand downstream areas. Embankment rehabilitation/construction will not obstruct the use of river \nwater or damage aquatic life. \n\n10. \nSmall-scale construction camps will be established at the sites. Attention will be paid to \nproper collection and disposal of waste, including establishment of waste disposal systems, and \nconstruction  of  temporary  toilets  with  small  treatment  devices,  and  sanitary  pit  latrines.  Solid \nwaste  from  construction  sites,  such  as  blocks  and  steel  bars,  will  be  recycled,  and  excavated \nsoil  and  stone  will  be  used  to  level  the  ground  or  fill  up  the  lowland.  Soil  erosion  will  be \ncontrolled by proper planning and staged construction to minimize exposing areas to rainfall for \nany  length  of  time.  A  new  embankment  will  be  provided  with  reasonable  fertile  topsoil  and \nplanted  with  vegetation  cover.  This  area  receives  less  rainfall  than  others,  and  erosion  will  be \neasier to manage. Planning, training, and quality control will ensure workers\u2019 health and safety, \nand minimize environmental problems such as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n59 \n\n2. \n\nGreater Caucasus Area \n\n11. \nThe  hill  torrents  do  not have  water  year-round  and  are  not,  therefore, used  as  a water \nsource  for  daily  life.  The  project  area  has  no  wetlands  or  forests.  The  interventions  will  not \nobstruct  the  natural  flow  of  water.  The  area  has  no  aquatic  life  that  should  not  be  disturbed. \nFlood protection structures are designed to avoid backwater effect that may deposit sediments, \nraise  the  riverbed,  and  cause  floods  upstream.  The  works  are  not  expected  to  aggravate \nproblems downstream. \n\n12. \nThe Project will not involve any significant earthwork on sloping lands. Major earthwork \nconsists  of  excavation  (about  4  meters  deep)  for  the  foundations  of  concrete  walls,  and  the \nexcavation  area  will  not  be  exposed  to  prolonged  rainfall.  Excavated  material  will  be  used  for \nbackfilling  so  no  surplus  material  will  require  disposal.  Skilled  and  unskilled  labor  is  available \nlocally for construction so large-scale construction camps need not be established. Attention will \nbe  paid  to  proper  collection  and  disposal  of  wastes,  however,  including  construction  of \ntemporary toilets with small treatment devices, and sanitary pit latrines. Planning, training, and \nquality  control  will  ensure  workers\u2019  health  and  safety,  and  minimize  environmental  problems \nsuch as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease.  \n\n3. \n\nGusar  \n\n13. \nThe  Samur  flows  along  the  border  with  Russia  and  is  a  perennial  stream.  The \ninterventions  are  upstream  of  Kirik  village  and  existing  flood  protection  structures  and  will  not \nobstruct the use of river flows. Flood protection structures will avoid any backwater effect that \nmay deposit sediment, raise the riverbed, and cause floods upstream. The proposed works are \nnot expected to aggravate problems downstream. The project area has no wetlands. \n\n14. \nSkilled and unskilled labor is available locally for construction so large-scale construction \ncamps  need  not  be  established.  Attention  will  be  paid  to  proper  collection  and  disposal  of \nwastes, however, including construction of temporary toilets with small treatment devices, and \nsanitary pit latrines. Planning, training, and quality control will ensure workers\u2019 health and safety, \nand minimize environmental problems such as noise, dust, waste oil, and grease. \n\n4. \n\nAstara  \n\n15. \nThe proposed interventions are very near international boundaries. Barbed wire on the \nAzerbaijan  side  limits  access  to  the  Astara  Hill  Torrent.    Flood  protection  structures  will  avoid \nany backwater effect that may deposit sediment, raise the riverbed, and cause floods upstream. \nThe proposed works are not expected to aggravate problems downstream. The project area has \nno wetlands. \n\n16. \nThe  flood  protection  structures  will  be  constructed  close  to  Astara  town.  Planning  and \ncontrol measures will minimize noise (no construction during night) and dust (sprinkling water in \ndry season) during construction. Skilled and unskilled labor is available locally for construction \nso large-scale construction camps need not be established. Soil erosion will not be a problem \nas works will be minor. \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n17. \nA project management office (PMO) will be established within the State Amelioration and \nIrrigation Committee to manage project activities on a daily basis. A monitoring and evaluation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n60 \n \n\n(M&E)  unit  with  three  staff  members  will  be  established  within  the  PMO.  One  responsibility  of \nthe M&E unit will be to implement the environmental monitoring program, including monitoring of \neffects and compliance and checking of several key indicators to track environmental changes, \nincluding  flooding  regime,  river  hydrology,  morphology,  sedimentation,  bank  erosion/cutting, \nquality of river water, groundwater fluctuations, ecology, and value of life. The M&E unit will also \nmonitor  dust,  noise,  and  other  construction  waste  during  project  implementation.  The  M&E \nprogram will start well in advance of detailed project design for each scheme and will extend 2 \nyears after project completion. \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n18. \nThe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants  had  a  team  of  environmental \nand  community  development  specialists  who  liaised  closely  with  the  beneficiaries.  A \ncomprehensive questionnaire was developed and meetings were held in May and June 2003 to \nassess  the  views  of  project  area  residents.  The  solutions  of  earthen  embankment  and  stone \npitching at various locations to check the river embankment were discussed, and the public in \ngeneral, satisfied with these solutions, was strongly in favor of the Project. \n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nThe IEE screening process shows that the Project will not (i) require any resettlement, \n19. \n(ii) result in any unwarranted loss of natural ecosystems or any significant adverse impacts on \nenvironment,  (ii)  cause  any  additional  hazards  to  endangered  species,  or  (iv)  increase  the \naffluent-poor  income  gap.  The  Project  will  promote  a  sense  of  security  among  low-income \nproject  area  residents,  significantly  reduce  flood  damage,  and  improve  the  project  area \neconomy. \n\nH. \n\nConclusions \n\n20. \nThe IEE has shown that the Project will have minor adverse environmental impacts and \nhow  they  can  be  kept  at  acceptable  levels  by  implementing  mitigation  measures  and  the \nmonitoring program. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment will not be required. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 November 2003) \n", "Currency Unit\nAZM1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "Azerbaijan manat (AZM) \n$0.000204 \nAZM4,911 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "Asian Development Bank \nexecuting agency \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nForestry Development Department \nflood forecasting and warning \ngross domestic product  \ninitial environmental examination \nInternational Monetary Fund \nirrigation systems department \nMinistry of Ecology and Natural Resources \nmonitoring and evaluation \nNational Meteorological Department \noperation and maintenance \nproject implementation unit \nproject management office \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nriver basin and flood management planning cell \nstate amelioration and irrigation committee \nstandard conversion factor \nState Procurement Agency \ntechnical assistance \n", "ADB \nEA \nEIRR \nEMP \nFDD \nFFW \nGDP \nIEE \nIMF \nISD \nMENR \nM&E \nNMD \nO&M \nPIU \nPMO \nPPTA \nRBFMPC \nSAIC \nSCF \nSPA \nTA \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of A.
