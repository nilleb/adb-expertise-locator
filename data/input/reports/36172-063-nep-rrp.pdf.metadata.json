If the Board approves \nthe proposed grant, administration of grant, and TA grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing the balance for \nthe TA. \n \n2. \nThe  program  seeks  to  promote  an  enabling  environment  in  Nepal  for  the  effective \ndelivery of public goods and services, especially at the local level. It will do this by strengthening \nnational  and  local  linkages  in  public  financial  management  (PFM),  mitigating  fiduciary  risks \nthrough  greater  transparency  and  public  participation,  modernizing  procurement  systems,  and \nenhancing the effectiveness of oversight and accountability agencies. The program will support \nefforts  by  the  government  of  Nepal  to  reform  budget,  fiscal,  and  fiduciary  risk  management  at \nthe sub-national or local government level (district development committee [DDC], municipality \nand  village  development  committee \n[VDC]),  public  procurement,  and  oversight  and \naccountability  institutions  at  the  national  level. 1  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Nepal \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  2010\u20132012  and  is  part  of  a  broader  set  of  fiduciary  risk \nreduction  initiatives  being  implemented  by  other  development  partners  in  Nepal,  notably  the \nPFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nNepal\u2019s  complex  and  protracted  political  transition.  Nepal  is  continuing  a  difficult \n3. \ntransition to democracy following the end of a decade-long civil conflict in April 2006. Given the \ndeep  ideological,  social,  and  economic  divisions  that  propelled  the  conflict,  this  transition  has \nbeen complex and sometimes halting. It is currently at an impasse and faces major challenges. \nThe  country  failed  to  approve  a  new  constitution  before  a  deadline  on  27  May  2012,  the \nconstituent  assembly  was  subsequently  dissolved,  and  the  need  for  new  assembly  elections \nhave  combined  to  prolong  the  transition  period.  This  has  increased  political  uncertainty  but  it \nalso presents opportunities to promote reforms and help the government shape the transition.  \n \n4. \nNepal\u2019s binding constraints. Several analyses have pointed to weak governance as a \nkey  constraint  to  the  post-conflict  economic  recovery  of  Nepal  and  its  further  growth  and \ndevelopment.3 The country ranks below the South Asian average on all six of the World Bank\u2019s \ngovernance indicators.4 Poor governance persists largely because of the highly fragmented and \noften polarized political landscape, which makes it difficult to form durable governing coalitions \nthat can focus on long-term public needs. The fragility of political coalitions consequently tends \nto foster government and management based on short-term political calculations rather than the \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2009. Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n4  Nepal\u2019s  rankings  in  five  of  the  six  indicators  declined  continuously  from  1996  to  2007.  The  exception  was  its \nposition in regulatory quality index, which improved marginally over the period from the 22.9 to 26.7 percentile. Its \nscores  place  Nepal  in  the  bottom  quartile  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  global  rankings.  See  World  Bank  governance \nindicators at www.govindicators.org. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npublic  interest  to  keep  the  coalitions  intact.  Partisan  battles  frequently  dominate  and  distort \npublic policy making and bureaucratic leadership.  \n \n5. \nNepal\u2019s acute economic challenges. Nepal continues to have the weakest performing \neconomy in South Asia. Its per capita gross national income in 2011 was estimated at $540 (in \ncurrent  prices),  compared  with  $770  for  Bangladesh,  $1,410  for  India,  $2,580  for  Sri  Lanka, \n$2,070 for Bhutan, and $6,530 for the Maldives.5 Nepal\u2019s economy grew by 4.6% in FY2012, up \nfrom 3.8% in FY2011, mainly due to growth in the agriculture and service sectors and increased \nremittance  inflows.6 While  the  incidence  of  poverty  has  declined,  25%  of  the  country\u2019s  people \nstill live below the national poverty line as of 2011. Income inequality is also high and the Gini \ncoefficient for the country stood at 0.35 in 2011.7 \n \n\n1. \n\nAssessment of Nepal\u2019s Public Financial Management System \n\nWeaknesses \n\nin  Nepal\u2019s  public  financial  management  system  at  the \n\n \n6. \nGaps in Nepal\u2019s public financial management system at the national level. Results \nof  a  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  conducted  in  2008 \nillustrated the weak state of governance in Nepal. The country scored an A on only 1 of the 31 \nPEFA indicators (budget credibility) and a B on only 3. It was given a C on 8 indicators, C+ on 9, \nD+  on  7,  and  D  (the  lowest  grade)  on  3. 8 Although  some  budget  and  fiscal  management \nindicators  scored  relatively  well,  the  assessment  points  to  poor  performance  in  budget \nclassification,  transparency  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  oversight  of  fiscal  risks  of \npublic  sector  entities,  and  the  extent  of  unreported  government  operations.  The  PEFA  results \nwere echoed in a country fiduciary risk assessment (FRA) by the Department for International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom  (DFID)  in  2008.9 This  led  the  Government  of  Nepal  to \nacknowledge the challenges posed by its \u201chigh fiduciary risk environment.\u201d10  \n \n7. \nlocal \ngovernment level. An unofficial study of local financial governance in 2006 indicated that PFM \ndeficiencies at the national level are mirrored at the local government level. Although the sample \nof  this  study  at  the  local  government  level  was  neither  comprehensive  nor  representative,  the \nfindings raised serious concerns. 11 No local government body scored an A, 33% were rated B, \n50% received a C, and 17% a D. These low ratings were based on such PFM shortcomings as \nineffective  internal  audits,  overpayments,  payment  without  adequate  supporting  documents, \nexceeding administrative expense limits, weakness in procurement and management of assets \nand inventory, and expenditures that lacked proper approval. \n \nBudget  and  fiscal  management  issues  at  the  local  government  level. Budget and \n8. \nfiscal  management  at  the  local  government  level  is  afflicted  by  numerous  problems.  Budget \npreparation  is  done  without  participation  by  the  public  because  local  government  councils  are \nnot elected and are run by civil servants and transitional \u201call-party\u201d mechanisms.  Internal audits \nare irregular and of poor quality due to the absence of qualified staff and poor controls, and both \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2012.

Kathmandu (May, p. 2). \n\n11 The sample consisted of 5 districts out of 75, 10 VDCs out of 3,915, and 3 municipalities out of 58. \n\n\fthe  reporting  and  monitoring  of  audit  findings  are  inadequate.  Transfers  from  the  central \ngovernment  for  the  capital  components  of  budgets  are  unpredictable  and  often  delayed  or \nreduced,  leading  to  postponement  of  projects  and  undermining  local  government  planning.  \nPoor costing of capital expenditure and asset maintenance is compounded by a lack of output \nand  outcome  orientation  in  budgets.  Failure  to  cost  services  results  in  poor  cost  recovery, \nparticularly  in  education  and  health,  the  two  sectors  that  account  for  a  majority  of  local \ngovernment  spending.  The  revenues  collected  by  municipalities,  which  have  the  most  scope \namong local governments for fiscal autonomy, fall well below actual potential because property \nrecords are incomplete, houses often lack even a proper address, and tax rates are out of date.  \n \n9. \nPublic  procurement  problems.  Sound  public  procurement  plays  a  central  part  in \neffective PFM but the problems with government procurement in Nepal, where it consumes up \nto 80% of the national budget, are severe. Nepal received a C for competition, value for money, \nand controls in the 2008 PEFA assessment (para. 6), which showed little improvement since a \nWorld  Bank  country  procurement  assessment  report  in  2002.12 A  joint  working  group  of  the \ngovernment, ADB, DFID, and the World Bank formed in 2008 found the Public Procurement Act \nhad major gaps and was ineffectively enforced. Collusion, intimidation, and other bad practices \nhad  been  growing,  especially  at  the  local  level.13 In  January  2012,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank \nconducted  a  joint  procurement  review  with  the  Public  Procurement  Monitoring  Office  (PPMO). \nThe  review  confirmed  earlier  findings  and  raised  concerns  about  devolution  of  procurement \nbecause the capacity to carry it out at local levels remains practically nonexistent.14 \n \n10.  Major accountability and oversight issues. The 2009 Global Integrity Report on Nepal \nshows  a  very  large  gap  between  the  laws  and  policies  on  accountability  and  actual \nInternational\u2019s  2011  Corruption \nimplementation.  Nepal \nPerceptions  Index.  Long-standing  leadership  vacuums  in  accountability  agencies,  notably  the \nCommission  for  the  Investigation  of  Abuse  of  Authority  (CIAA)  and  the  Office  of  the  Auditor \nGeneral, prevent Nepal from addressing its governance problems squarely. The government\u2019s \nNational  Vigilance  Centre  (NVC)  remains  institutionally  weak.  Nepal\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  to \ncombat corruption have large loopholes not only in practice but also on paper. For example, the \nCIAA  has  no  jurisdiction  over  the  judiciary,  the  military,  or  the  private  sector.  With  few \ninvestigations and convictions of corrupt high-level officials, corruption in Nepal has become a \nlow-risk, high-reward activity.15 \n \n\nranks  154th  on  Transparency \n\n2. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Public Financial Management Reform Program \n\n \nGovernment  initiatives  to  address  public  financial  management  problems  at  the \n11. \nnational  level. The government developed a public financial management reform program for \n2009\u20132012  that  focused  on  six  areas:  tax  collection,  budget  formulation,  budget  execution, \naccounting  and  reporting,  external  audit,  and  institutional  capacity  (footnote  10).  Its    taxation \nreforms, institutionalization of a medium-term expenditure framework to link policies to budgets, \ninternal  and  external  audits,  establishment  of  a  treasury  single  account,  procurement  reform, \nand  strengthening  of  the  PEFA  secretariat  are  at  different  stages  of  implementation.  With \nrespect  to  public  procurement,  the  government  formulated  and  implemented  the  Public \nProcurement Strategic Framework Phase 1, 2010\u20132013 (footnote 13). \n \n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 2002.

The  government\u2019s  local  governance  and  capacity  development  program \n(LGCDP) for 2008\u20132014 has spearheaded local governance reforms.16 ADB, through its Nepal \nGovernance Support Program,17 supported the LGCDP under a joint financing arrangement with \nfive other development partners.18 The LGCDP has become an important national program for \nreducing  poverty  and  tackling  social  exclusion.  It  established  a  framework  to  consolidate \nfragmented donor assistance and streamlined fiscal transfers to local government bodies. This \nhas led to improved local service delivery even in difficult areas. To guard against fiduciary risks, \nthe LGCDP supported social mobilization activities to empower community-level groups such as \nward  citizen  forums  and  citizen  action  centers  to  participate  in  local  government  decision \nmaking and make up for the absence of local elected officials. This approach was coupled with \noutcome-based monitoring to hold local governments accountable, notably through a framework \nof minimum conditions and performance measures (MC&PM) for DDCs. \n \n13. \nEmergence of fiduciary risks in local governance. The midterm report on the LGCDP \nfound fiduciary risks in its implementation.19 An FRA of local governance conducted in response \nby ADB and its development partners20 found a lack of transparency and political interference in \nbudget allocations, poor accounting and reporting, noncompliance with procurement regulations, \nand  the  absence  of  internal  and  external  audits.  Development  partners  also  financed  a  public \nexpenditure  tracking  survey  (PETS)  of  the  LGCDP  to  better  understand  the  sources  and \nseverity of fiduciary risks. The findings reflected the results of the FRA.21 A focused evaluation \nof the LGCDP by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) in July 2012 \ncalled  for  new  policies  to  reduce  fiduciary  risks. 22  Just  as  important  as  the  fiduciary \nshortcomings  is  the  fact  that  central  government  policies  are  not  enforced  and,  therefore,  not \ncredible and local stakeholders lack incentives to implement them.   \n \n14. \nThe  government\u2019s  response  to  fiduciary  risks.  The  MOFALD  approved  a  fiduciary \nrisk  reduction  action  plan  (FRRAP)  in  March  2012  to  respond  to  the  findings  on  the  problem \n(para.  13).  The  FRRAP  reflects  lessons  learned  from  implementing  the  LGCDP,  notably  the \nimportance of strengthening PFM systems at the local level, ensuring results-oriented capacity \nbuilding in PFM in local government bodies, and bolstering social mobilization approaches.23 By \nfocusing  on  local  governance  reforms,  the  FRRAP  complements  national-level  PFM  reforms \nbeing supported by the PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).24 \n                                                 \n16 Government of Nepal. 2008.

Mobilization  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  support  for  the  government\u2019s  reforms. \nADB  mobilized  additional  resources  to  cofinance  the  program  and  support  the  government\u2019s \nwide-ranging PFM reforms. It has secured cofinancing from DFID of $6.5 million equivalent. A \nseparate  cofinancing  proposal  for  \u20ac4.5  million  by  the  European  Union  (EU)  is  also  being \ndiscussed.  Because  the  EU  decision  may  not  be  made  until  December  2012,  only  the  DFID \ncontribution is reflected in this Report and Recommendation of the President. The program has \nreceived  strong  endorsement  by  the  local  governance  donor  group  and  the  PFM  donor  group \nco-chaired by the EU and the World Bank. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  program\u2019s  expected  impact  will  be  more  effective  delivery  of  public  goods  and \n16. \nservices in Nepal, especially at the local government  level. The intended outcome is enhanced \nefficiency, transparency, and integrity of public finances at the national and sub-national levels. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \nThe  program  outputs  will  be  (i)  improved  local  government  budget  and  fiscal \nmanagement, (ii) strengthened fiduciary risk management at the local government level, (iii) an \nenhanced  public  procurement  system,  and  (iv)  strengthened  oversight  and  accountability \ninstitutions. These outputs will be achieved through four component sets of activities. A policy \nmatrix of policy actions that serve as performance triggers for disbursements is in Appendix 4. \n \nComponent 1: Local government budget and fiscal management. The program will \n18. \nsupport  government  efforts  to  foster  more  effective  local  government  budget  and  expenditure \nmanagement  and  fiscal  sustainability.  These  reforms  include  (i)  strengthening  participatory \nplanning  processes  to  help  enforce  implementation  of  local  governance  guidelines,  including \nallocation  of  block  grants  and  funding  for  women,  children,  and  disadvantaged  groups;  (ii) \nintroducing performance-based grants for VDCs; (iii) enhancing timely budget disbursements to \nlocal governments by applying a medium-term budget framework for DDCs and municipalities; \n(v) institutionalizing results-based management for local governments through the development \nof a results framework and the introduction of annual performance plans for local officials; and \n(vi)  enhancing  revenue  management  of  municipalities  through  the  piloting  of  a  municipal \nadministration revenue system (MARS) to increase their ability to raise their own revenues and \nto improve tax compliance by better application of incentives and penalties. \n \n19. \nComponent  2:    Fiduciary  risk  management  at  the  local  government  level.  The \nprogram will support government reforms to reduce fiduciary risks and strengthen safeguards in \nlocal governance. These reforms include (i) strengthening local government accounting systems \nthrough  computerization  of  accounting  systems  in  DDCs,  municipalities,  and  VDCs;  (ii) \nimproving  management  and  accountability  of  user  groups  through  public  auditing;  (iii) \nstrengthening  civic  oversight  through  capacity  building  of  ward  citizen  forums  and  citizen \nawareness centers, as well as adoption of guidelines on public and social audits; (iv) enhancing \ntransparency  in  local  governance  through  development  of  websites  that  will  disclose  local \ngovernment  revenues  and  expenditures;  (v)  reinforcing  oversight  mechanisms  of  MOFALD \nthrough support for its good governance unit; and (vi) strengthening external and internal audits \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ncapacity  building  for  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General,  (iii)  the  fostering  of  demand-side  capacity  building,  (iv) \nresearch on implementation of audit recommendations, and (v) a PETS of the education sector. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fof  local  governments  through  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  auditing  guidelines  and \ndevelopment of an audit clearance tracking system. \n \n20. \nComponent  3:  Public  procurement  reform.  The  program  will  support  government \nefforts to increase safeguards in public procurement by making it more transparent, competitive, \nand efficient. It will specifically support public procurement reforms at the local level proposed in \nthe FRRAP. These include the establishment of procurement units in DDCs and municipalities, \nthe  development  of  annual  procurement  plans  in  local  governments,  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  procurement  master  plans  for  local  governments,  the  development  of \nstandard bidding documents in Nepali for procurement at the VDC level, and capacity building \nof  procurement  staff  in  DDCs  and  municipalities.  Support  for  the  development  of  an  e-\ngovernment procurement (e-GP) system will be provided through the program\u2019s associated TA. \n \n21. \nComponent  4:  Oversight  and  accountability  capacity  building.  The  program  will \nsupport  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  its  oversight  and  accountability  functions.  The \nprogram will support the government\u2019s National Strategy against Corruption 2012, including the \nAnti-Corruption  Strategy  and  Work  Plan  of  the  NVC.  It  will  also  help  the  NVC  strengthen  its \ntechnical  audit  capacity  and  expand  its  corruption  prevention  tools.  The  program\u2019s  associated \nTA will support the development of a corruption vulnerability diagnostic instrument that can be \nused to assess the corruption risks and safeguards of public investment projects. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe estimated adjustment costs are in Table 1. \n \n\nThe total adjustment cost of the program is estimated at $30 million (excluding TA costs). \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nTable 1: Program Adjustment Costs \n($ million) \n\nItem \nComponent 1: Local government budget and fiscal management \nComponent 2: Local government fiduciary risk management \nComponent 3: Public procurement reform \nComponent 4: Oversight and accountability capacity-building \n \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Nepal estimates. \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nAmount \n7.00 \n18.00 \n3.00 \n2.00 \n30.00 \n\n \nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $21  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n23. \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  government  has  also  requested  a  grant \nequivalent to $4 million from the Government of the United Kingdom to help finance part of the \nprogram.  This  grant  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  finance  the  remaining \nprogram cost of $5 million from its own budget.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe PEFA steering committee will be the steering committee for and will provide policy \n24. \nguidance to the program. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the program executing agency \nand will be responsible for the overall implementation of the program, including compliance with \nall policy actions, facility administration, disbursements and maintenance of records. The MOF \nwill  receive  support  from  the  PEFA  Secretariat,  which  will  serve  as  the  PMU,  and  provide:  (i) \ntechnical  guidance  to  the  Implementing  Agencies,  (ii)  periodically  review  the  progress  of \nprogram  implementation,  and  (iii)  ensure  coordination  of  the  program  with  other  reform \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finitiatives.  MOFALD,  PPMO  and  NVC  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  MOFALD  will \nimplement  components  1  and  2  of  the  program,  PPMO  will  implement  component  3  of  the \nprogram and NVC will implement component 4 of the program. PPMO and NVC, respectively, \nwill  establish  a  PCU  to  implement  their  respective  components.  The  existing  program \ncoordination unit for LGCDP in MOFALD shall serve as the PCU for MOFALD. Each PCU will \nhave  a  manager  and  will:  (i)  supervise  implementation  of  activities  under  their  respective \ncomponent, (ii) prepare and submit progress reports to the program executing agency and PMU, \nand (iii) liaise with the PEFA Secretariat in the implementation of the program.  \n \n25. \nThe program  will be implemented  over 3  years from November 2012 to  October 2015. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \nof  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans.25   The  proceeds \nwill  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs,  excluding  taxes  and  duties,  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries and exclude items on the list of ineligible items and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired  if,  during  each  year  that  grant  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of \nNepal\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  in  each  withdrawal  request.  Other  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. The implementation arrangements are in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nArrangements \nNovember 2012\u2013October 2015 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  October 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \nDisbursement  \n\nPEFA steering committee (Secretary of Finance, Chair)  \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Federal Affairs and Local Development, Public Procurement \nMonitoring Office, National Vigilance Centre \nThe $25 million policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches. \nTranche 1, in the amount of $11.9 million, will be disbursed upon grant \neffectiveness.

The TA will also support the development and pilot implementation of MARS and the e-\nGP  system.  The  TA  project  will  have  the  same  intended  impact  and  outcome  as  the  project, \nwhich are to be achieved through the following outputs: \n \n27. \nOutput  1:  Key  public  financial  management  diagnostic  tools.  The  TA  will  support \nthe implementation of key activities in the policy matrix. This will include two public expenditure \ntracking surveys\u2014the first at midterm and the second towards the end of the program\u2014and a \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPEFA assessment at the local government level that preferably will be undertaken at the same \ntime as a national PEFA assessment. The TA will also support the development of a framework \nof MC&PM for VDCs. 26 The TA will help the PMU (FCGO) coordinate these activities. \n \nOutput 2: Municipal administration revenue system. The TA will develop MARS and \n28. \npilot  it  in  at  least  one  municipality.  The  MARS  will  enable  municipalities  to  raise  more  of  their \nown  revenues,  particularly  from  such  sources  as  the  house  and  land  tax  and  the  integrated \nproperty tax. By establishing an electronic database of taxable houses and land and taxpayers, \nMARS  will  widen  the  municipal  tax  base  and  enhance  tax  compliance.  The  revenue \nmanagement  and  financial  planning  module  of  MARS  will  be  designed  to  exchange  data  with \nthe government\u2019s integrated financial management information system. \n \nOutput 3: E-government procurement system. Building on the current ADB TA to the  \n29. \nPPMO,  the  TA  will  develop  a  full-fledged  e-GP  system  to  cover  all  aspects  of  the  public \nprocurement  cycle  and  will  support  the  rollout  of  the  e-submission  module  of  e-GP  to  at  least \neight  ministries. 27  The  complete  e-GP  system  to  be  developed  will  include  electronic  bid \nevaluation,  contract  award,  contract  administration,  and  payments;  creation  of  online \ncatalogues; and measures for enabling procurement performance analysis and auditing. The TA \nwill also help develop e-GP training modules. \n \nThe TA will be implemented together with the program through three consulting services \n30. \npackages.  Package  1  will  support  attainment  of  key  policy  actions,  notably  the  PETS  and  the \nPEFA surveys, and the formulation of the MC&PM framework. Packages 2 and 3 will be for the \ndevelopment of MARS and e-GP system, respectively, and will include procurement of hardware \nand software. Due to the highly technical nature of these activities, the firm recruitment will use the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a  standard  quality-cost  ratio  of  90:10.  All \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). All procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, all equipment procured \nwill  be  retained  by  the  government.  All  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).28 \n \nThe  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $3,000,000. 29  The  TA  will  be \n31. \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) in the amount \nof $500,000, and cofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom in an amount equivalent \nto $2,500,000, to be administered by ADB. Additional cofinancing has been sought from the EU \nthat, if approved, will be utilized to expand the scope of the TA to support public procurement \ncapacity building and other PFM reforms (paras. 27\u201329). 30 \n\n                                                 \n26 The  program  will  also  draw  on  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund\u2019s  work  on  accrual  accounting, \nstrengthening of expenditure reporting, studies on block grant guidelines, and formula-based grant allocations. \n27 The  TA  will  build  on  the  small-scale  TA  on  Strengthening  Public  Procurement  Management  and  Portfolio \n\nPerformance being implemented by ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission. TA 7752 \n\n28 The TA packages, implementation schedule, and budget are in the Technical Assistance for Supporting the Public \nManagement  Reform  Program:  Terms  of  Reference  and  Cost  Estimates  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n29 Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Strengthening  Public  Management  Program:  Terms  of  Reference  and \n\nCost Estimates (accessible from the list of limited documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n30 Subject to EU parliamentary approval, the EU Delegation to Nepal has indicated it can provide co-financing of \u20ac4.5 \nmillion for the TA. In the event this co-financing is approved, the scale of the Program and TA will be expanded as \nfollows:  (i)  expansion  of  e-GP  rollout  to  1  or  2  additional  other  ministries  and  agencies;  (ii)  greater  coverage  of \npublic  procurement  capacity  building;  (iii)  MARS  rollout  to  1  other  municipality  and  additional  training  on  MARS; \nand (iv) implementation of additional internal audit capacity building and support for the FCGO\u2019s PMU functions. \n\n\fA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe highly technical components of the program pertain to the MARS and e-GP systems. \n32. \nA two-step assessment was conducted for these activities. The first was an as-is analysis of the \nissues  facing  municipal  finance  and  public  procurement.  The  second  was  a  to-be  analysis  for \nthe proposed interventions, including scope of work, timing, and costing. The program drew on \nthe findings of the third ADB\u2013World Bank procurement review mission completed in March 2012. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe main benefits from component 1 will be improved management of central transfers \n33. \nto local governments and enhanced ability of local governments - municipalities using MARS in \nparticular - to mobilize their own revenues.31 Benefits under component 2 will be a reduction in \nfinancial  irregularities  and  improvements  in  public  service  delivery  as  a  result  of  improved \naccounting  systems  and  results-based  management.  Wider  public  participation  in  local \ngovernment budgeting and accounting, and more effective auditing will also reduce irregularities. \nComponent 3 benefits will be expenditure savings of about $20 million per year from lower costs, \nbetter pricing, and higher quality goods and services due to more competitive and transparent \npublic  procurement.  Benefits  under  component  4  will  come  in  the  form  of  a  reduction  of \ngovernment arrears of about $7 million annually. Overall, these benefits strongly justify program \ncosts. Moreover, the increased stream of municipal revenues and cost savings will strengthen \nfiscal positions at both national and local levels and incentivize further reforms. \n \nC.  \n \n34. \nline  with  ADB's  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan was carried out.32 The assessment complements studies by the DFID \nand the World Bank. The government unveiled a PFM reform program in 2009 and developed a \npublic procurement strategy framework in July 2010. The government has passed the following \nanti-corruption  legislation:  the  Good  Governance  Act  of  2008,  the  Right  to  Information  Act  of \n2007, the Public Procurement Act of 2007, and the Anti-Money-Laundering Act of 2008. A risk \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan  has  been  developed  for  the  program  to  mitigate \ngovernance  risks.33 In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  and  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nD. \n\nA  governance  risk  assessment \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\nin \n\n35. \nThe program will benefit poor and marginalized groups, including women and children. \nLocal government budget and fiscal management reforms will ensure more timely and reliable \nfiscal transfers of funds to support gender empowerment and social inclusion (GESI) objectives. \nA key policy action of the program will be to demonstrate implementation of earmarked funding \nfor  GESI  activities  according  to  the  government\u2019s  guidelines\u201415%  for  disadvantaged  groups, \n\n                                                 \n31 A base case scenario of revenue gains in a medium-sized municipality shows an increase of $8 million\u2013$11 million \non a cumulative basis in the first 5 years after introduction of MARS. This is based on an assumption of an annual \n5% increase in the number of houses registered and an increase in the tax compliance rate from the current level \nof  30%  to  around  90%  in  5  years.

Downward  accountability  mechanisms  in  budget \npreparation will ensure that local projects are aligned with GESI goals. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n36. \nThe  program\u2019s  reforms  do  not  involve  physical  construction  activities  and  an  adverse \nimpact  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  or  indigenous  peoples  is  unlikely.  The \nprogram is thus classified as category C in all three of ADB\u2019s safeguard areas.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n37. \nThe governance risk assessment carried out for ADB\u2019s Nepal CPS 2010\u20132012 identified \nrisks  in  PFM,  procurement,  and  corruption.  Mitigating  measures  to  address  these  risks  are \noutlined  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  (footnote  33).  In  addition,  to  guard \nagainst procurement risks in program implementation, it is ADB through the TA that will conduct \nthe  procurement  for  the  e-GP  and  MARS  systems.  With  respect  to  consultants  who  will  be \nengaged by MOFALD, ADB will be consulted in their selection. This consultation is not required \nunder  the  program  modality  but  it  has  been  added  as  a  risk  mitigating  measure.  Finally,  ADB \nand its development partners are regularly engaged in dialogue with the government and have \nhad a strong track record in securing government responsiveness to address fiduciary risks \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n38. \nThe  government  and  the  MOF  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the program implementation arrangements and grant documents. \n \nThe grant will become effective after all conditions for the release of the first tranche of \n39. \nthe program, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the \ngrant agreement, have been complied with, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n40. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $21,000,000  to  Nepal  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  for  the  Strengthening  Public  Management  Program,  on  terms  and \nconditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board; \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$4,000,000  to  Nepal  for  the  Strengthening  Public  Management  Program,  to  be \nprovided by the Government of the United Kingdom; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof  $2,500,000  to  the  Government  of  Nepal  for  Supporting  the  Strengthening \nPublic  Management  Program  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  the  United \nKingdom on a grant basis. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nHaruhiko V.
