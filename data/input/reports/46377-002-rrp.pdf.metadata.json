Sindh is the second-most populated province in Pakistan with \n42  million  people  (including  16  million  in  metropolitan  Karachi)  and  is  the  third-largest \ngeographically with an area of 140,914 square kilometers. More than 60% of Sindh\u2019s population \nlives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main source of livelihood.  \n \n4. \nBecause  of  the  province\u2019s  coastal  access,  Sindh  has  a  highly  diversified  economy. \nHeavy industry and finance are centered in and around Karachi, while a substantial agricultural \nbase  can  be  found  along  the  Indus  River.  The  most  important  crops  are  cotton,  rice,  wheat, \nsugarcane, bananas, and mangoes. Sindh is also rich in natural resources (gas, petroleum, and \ncoal),  as  well  as  renewable  energy  (wind  and  solar).  Despite  its  economic,  geographic,  and \nresource  advantages,  recent  growth  and  social  development  trends  indicate  that  Sindh  is  not \nrealizing its full potential. Economic growth from 2005 to 2015 has been erratic with a trend of \ndeclining,  while  real  incomes  have  steadily  fallen  since  2006.  This  deterioration  has  been \ncaused  by  several  structural  constraints,  including  (i)  a  stark  urban\u2013rural  bifurcation  of  the \nprovince, which limits economic and social cohesion; (ii) poor infrastructure provision, especially \ninsufficient and unreliable road connectivity (exacerbated by massive floods in 2010 and 2011); \n(iii) increasing skills, factors, and input constraints impeded growth of production and incomes; \nand (iv) poor governance and internal security challenges.  \n \nSindh\u2019s  economic  development  is  also  unbalanced  geographically.  Karachi,  the \n5. \nprovincial  capital  and  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  city,  accounts  for  about  20%  of  the  country\u2019s  gross \ndomestic  product,  75%  of  national  trade,  and  more  than  30%  of  value  added  in  large-scale \nmanufacturing. Rural Sindh, especially the poorly connected southeast part of the province, lags \nin both economic and social development with a poverty headcount double that of urban areas. \nAlmost  half (46%)  of  the  rural  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line  and  have  low  per  capita \nincomes  and  calorie  intake.  The  province\u2019s  rural  poor  also  suffer  from  high  unemployment; \ninadequate  access  to  education,  sanitation,  and  health  facilities;  an  unhygienic  environment; \nand  insecure  access  to  natural  resources.2 Lack  of  reliable,  all-weather  roads  has  contributed \nsignificantly to economic and social deprivation in rural areas. \n\n6. \nRoads  are  the  predominant  mode  of  transport  in  Pakistan,  carrying  91%  of  passenger \ntraffic in terms of passenger-kilometers and 96% of freight traffic in ton-kilometers.3 Transport in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sustainable  Development  Policy  Institute.  2012.  Clustered  Deprivation:  District  Profile  of  Poverty  in  Pakistan. \n\nIslamabad. \n\n3  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2014. Pakistan Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. Islamabad. The modal \nshare for passenger-kilometers was 90.9% for roads, 5.3% for railways, and 3.8% for aviation. The modal share for \nfreight ton-kilometer was 98.8% for roads, 0.3% for railways, and 0.9% for aviation. \n\n \n\n\fSindh follows a similar modal pattern. The classified paved road network of 25,737 km in Sindh \nincludes  1,365  km  of  national  highways,  2,830  km  of  provincial  highways,  11,630  km  of \nsecondary  roads,  and  9,912  km  of  improved  access  roads.  In  addition,  the  province  has \n22,000\u201354,000  km  of  unclassified  roads,  streets,  and  tracks.4 Much  of  the  road  network  is \nspread densely along the banks of the Indus River and its major irrigation and drainage canals. \nRural road connectivity is poor in the southeastern districts of the province and along the coast. \nThe extensive arid and desert regions in the west and east of the province have few all-weather \nengineered  roads.  The  WSD  is  responsible  for  the  14,460  km  of  provincial  highways  and \nsecondary  roads,  while  the  local  district  governments  are  responsible  for  all  local  and  access \nroads. The National Highway Authority manages national highways and motorways. \n \n7. \nSindh\u2019s  provincial  highways,  which  handle  traffic  with  a  range  of  3,000\u20138,000  vehicles \ndaily,  connect  provincial  administrative  and  commercial  centers  with  district  headquarters  and \nmarket towns. They are vital in facilitating intra-provincial trade and commerce; providing access \nto  health,  education,  and  other  public  services;  and  reducing  poverty  by  creating  jobs  and \nbusiness  opportunities.  However,  the  condition  of  the  provincial  highway  system  is  below \nnational  standard,  and  the  pavement  surface  conditions  and  riding  quality  are  deteriorating. \nMany of these roads have been upgraded from rural roads or tracks with low bearing capacity to \nsustain heavier traffic loads and resist damage from storm surges and flooding. Most provincial \nhighways  have  substandard  geometric  standards.  For  example,  pavement  widths  vary  from  \n5 meters (m) to 7 m (without hard shoulders) compared with a national standard 7.30 m width \n(i.e., two 3.65 m lanes) with 1.50 m hard shoulders. The pavement condition of more than half of \nthe  road  network  is  rated  poor  or  bad.  Inadequate  expenditure  on  road  maintenance  and  an \ninability  to  properly  prioritize  expenditures  have  accelerated  road  deterioration,  resulting  in  an \nincrease in traffic accidents, vehicle operating costs, and travel times. \n \n8. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  $3.37  billion  in  assistance  to \nPakistan\u2019s  transport  sector,  including  loans  to  the  Sindh  provincial  government  to  improve \nsecondary roads and rural roads.5 In addition, ADB loans to the federal government for national \nhighways  have  included  some  sections  in  Sindh.  However,  the  provincial  highways,  which \naccount  for  more  than  30%  of  the  traffic  on  the  provincial  road  network  and  are  a  vital  link \nbetween national highways and rural access roads, have received marginal attention\u2014despite \ngovernment efforts, such as mobilizing resources through public\u2013private partnership (PPP) and \nbilateral  financing.  Road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  needs  exceed  the  anticipated  funding \nfrom  these  sources  as  well  as  the  provincial  budget.  Through  this  project,  ADB  will  provide \ncritical support for Sindh\u2019s high-priority road rehabilitation and maintenance program, including \npolicy and institutional assistance to sustainably maintain and preserve the provincial highways. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  plan  to  upgrade  the  quality  of  the  road \nnetwork,  and  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  objectives  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2015\u201320196 regarding development of provincial highways in Pakistan. The project is included \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.7 \n \n9. \nRoad  master  plan. Sindh needs to renew its road master plan, which was approved in \n1995  and  has  not  been  updated.  Although  the  government  has  invested  more  than  \nPRs100 billion in road maintenance programs from 2005 to 2015, some investments may have \nfallen  short  of  achieving  the  expected  outcomes  because  of  changes  in  the  structure  and \n                                                \n4  In  addition  to  the  classified  paved  road  system,  these  may  include  canal  roads,  urban  roads  and  streets,  and \n\nunimproved rural roads and tracks. \n\n5  ADB. 2015.

For example, some regional economic hubs developed after \n2010 need to be connected with high-quality road links. The project will support the government \nin preparing the Sindh road master plan by assessing (i) the status and condition of the overall \ntransport  system,  including  all  modes;  (ii)  the  characteristics  of  transport  demand  and  supply; \n(iii)  the  current  and  projected  road  traffic  demand,  reflecting  trends  in  economic  growth  and \nregional  and  subregional  trade,  as  well  as  the  transport  modal  split;  and  (iv)  the  spatial \ndistribution, serviceability, and condition of road infrastructure.  \n\n \nThe master plan will identify the physical gaps and capacity constraints in Sindh\u2019s road \n10. \nnetwork  relative  to  current  and  future  traffic  demand,  as  well  as  the  system  improvements \nneeded to satisfy the mobility and logistics requirements of a modern economy. The master plan \nwill  incorporate  a  comprehensive  medium-term  road  development  and  maintenance  program \nwith  a  phased  plan  of  road  investments  over  a  10-year  period.  Feasibility  studies  for  the  \nhigh-priority  road  investments  will  also  be  included  in  this  assignment.  The  master  plan  will \nidentify  policies  and  complementary  investments  to  support  multimodal  transport  services  and \nintermodal  connectivity.  While  the  master  plan  will  focus  on  physical  planning,  investment \npolicies,  and  modalities,  it  will  also  address  the  institutional,  financing,  regulatory,  and  pricing \nand/or  cost-recovery  aspects,  as  well  as  traffic  accidents,  congestion,  and  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts.  Moreover,  the  master  plan  will  include  roads  and  streets  in  metropolitan  and \nurban  areas  of  Sindh.  It  will  develop  a  geographic  information  system-based  spatial  and \ncondition  inventory  of  all  roads  to  provide  the  baseline  information  and  data  for  a  road  asset \nmanagement system. \n \n11. \nSustainable  road  maintenance.  Annual  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  and \npreservation  have  been insufficient to  operate  and  maintain the road  system  at  an  acceptable \nservice level. Road sector allocations received by the WSD have averaged about 2.0%\u20132.5% of \nSindh\u2019s  annual  budget;  more  than  50%  of  this  allocation  is  spent  on  new  road  and  bridge \nconstruction,  and  upgrading  works.  The  expenditure  on  road  maintenance  has  averaged  less \nthan 1% of Sindh\u2019s annual budget. Moreover, the scarce maintenance funds are not spent in a \ncost-effective way. Road sections are subjectively selected for maintenance based on a \u201cworst \nfirst\u201d approach. Ad hoc treatments are then applied based on the experience of the responsible \nengineer. The institutional strengthening component of the project will support the development \nand operation of a modern road asset management system\u2014based on an existing one financed \nby  ADB8\u2014to  optimize  the  use  of maintenance funds. The government  has  agreed  to  dedicate \nfunds  in  the  annual  budget  for  upgrading,  data  collection,  and  operation  of  the  road  asset \nmanagement  system.  Sindh  also  intends  to  increase  50%  of  the  annual  road  maintenance \nbudget  allocation  by  2020,  compared  with  the  annual  road  maintenance  budget  for  the  fiscal \nyear  2016.  To  promote  sustainable  road  maintenance,  the  project  will  pilot  concessions \nsupported by road tolls for the operation and maintenance of two selected sections. \n \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  road  sector.  Sindh  has  successfully  engaged  the \n12. \nprivate sector in transport sector through the establishment of a PPP act, policy, guidelines, and \nlegal  framework.  A  number  of  PPP  projects  have  been  implemented.  The WSD  has  identified \neight  candidate  road  projects  with  a  total  length  of  700  km  for  private  investors.  At  the  same \ntime,  the  government  is  also  trying  to  engage  the  private  sector  in  road  maintenance  through \nlong-term concessions (such as operation, maintenance, and transfer). Under such concessions, \nprivate sector entities would operate and maintain the road for a specified period after rectifying \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fmajor  deficiencies  in  the  roads  and recover  their  costs through  tolls.  Sindh  is  one  of the  most \nadvanced provinces in Pakistan in terms of using PPP in the road sector. \n \n13. \nRoad safety and accident response. Previous ADB loans supported the government\u2019s \nefforts  to  improve  road  safety.  Under  the  institutional  strengthening  component  of  this  project, \nthe  government  has  requested  emergency  response  equipment  for  traffic  police,  who  are  first \nresponders  to  accidents  but  lack  the  equipment  needed  to  safely  extract  crash  victims  at  the \nscene. Police are not trained to properly move people from vehicles and provide basic first aid \nand  treatment  to  crash  victims  before  they  are  sent  to  hospitals.  The  project  will  provide \nhydraulic  cutters,  lifting  equipment,  and  basic  first  aid  equipment.  Training  in  the  use  of  the \nequipment and emergency response procedures will be provided. \n \nLessons  learned.  Before  2009,  ADB  had  financed  road  projects  in  each  province, \n14. \nincluding ones that improved national and provincial highways, as well as rural roads. However, \neach project involved more than one executing agency, resulting in implementation difficulties. \nDespite the  efforts  of  ADB  and  its  counterpart  agencies,  significant  implementation challenges \nremain  in  completing  projects  on  schedule  and  on  budget.  Efficient  project  implementation \nrequires improvements to the procurement, safeguards, and contract management performance \nof  executing  agencies.  While  ADB  interventions  in  Pakistan  have  made  some  progress  in \nimproving the function  of transport  corridors, road  administrations  (especially  in  the  provinces) \nstill  lack  (i)  asset  management  systems,  (ii)  sustainable  means  of  revenue  generation,  \n(iii) contract management skills, (iv) needs-based allocations of funds, (v) a maintenance focus, \nand  (vi)  a  record  of  compliance  with  international  safeguard  practices. 9  ADB  should  avoid \nambitious  institutional  reform  targets  and  unrealistic  reform  implementation  schedules,  and \nensure  government\u2019s  ownership  and  incentives  for  institutional  strengthening.  ADB  must \nrecognize that reform is a long-term task that requires a step-by-step approach consistent with \nlocal  realities.10 Other  success  factors  for  ADB  projects  include  a  stabled  professional  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  extensive  monitoring  and  regular  coordination,  and  a  realistic \nimplementation schedule. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  an  efficient  and  integrated  transportation  system  established  to \n15. \nfacilitate the development of a competitive economy (Pakistan Vision 2025).11 The outcome will \nbe key sections of the provincial highway network in Sindh improved.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nProject outputs are (i) about 328 km of provincial roads rehabilitated; and (ii) institutional \n\n16. \ncapacity of the WSD strengthened in road planning, maintenance, and road safety. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n17. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $227.51 million (Table 1). \n\n \n \n\n                                                \n9  Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

Six  road  sections  were  selected  based  on \nthe  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  government  with  consideration  of  traffic  volume  and  road \ncondition.  Two  roads  are  located  in  the  upper  Sindh  and  four  roads  in  lower  Sindh.  \nThe  technical  options  include  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation,  depending  on  the  condition  of \nthe  road.  The  treatment  strategy  will  upgrade  all  roads  to  the  standard  width  of  7.3  m  for \ntraffic  growth  and  \ncarriageways  with  proper  drainage  and  safety \n\nfacilities.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Provincial  Road  Improvement.  Manila  \n\n(TA 8406-PAK). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nclimate-resilient measures were considered in the design. A road safety audit was conducted for \nall roads, and the results were incorporated into the final design. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe selection of the road segments for the project and the improvement standard to be \napplied  to  each  were  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  All  selected \nsections have an economic internal rate of return above 12%. The economic evaluation of the \noverall  project  compared  the  incremental  costs  of  building,  operating,  and  maintaining  the \nproject  roads  against  the  incremental  economic  benefits  arising  from  reductions  in  vehicle \noperating  costs  and  travel  times.  The  analysis  was  undertaken  in  line  with  standard  ADB \nprocedures,  using  a  12%  discount  rate  and  20-year  appraisal  period  after  construction.  \nThe  project  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  shows  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  yielding  an \noverall economic internal rate of return of 15.8%. \n\n \n25. \nTraffic  on  the  project  roads  currently  averages  about  6,000  vehicles  a  day.  Of  these, \nmore  than  60%  are  motorcycles  and  rickshaws,  and  only  7%  are  heavy  vehicles  (e.g.,  vans, \ntrucks, buses, and articulated vehicles). However, heavy vehicles cause most of the road wear. \nThe  imposition  of  tolls  for  heavy  vehicles  on  two  sections  with  high  traffic  volumes  \n(Khyber\u2013Sanghar  and  TM  Khan\u2013Badin)  would  generate  average  annual  net  revenue  of  about \nPRs135 million. This would not be sufficient to cover the repayment of investment costs, but it \nwould  improve  sustainability  by  offsetting  the  additional  cost  of  operating  and  maintaining  the \nproject roads. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nto  undertake  procurement  activities \n\n26. \nThe  WSD\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management  capacities  were  assessed  and \nfound  to  be  sufficient.  The  WSD  has  implemented  ADB  funded  projects  and  has  adequate \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement \ncapacity \nprocedures. The WSD is also able to maintain good accounting systems, financial controls, and \naudit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing rules, and internal control systems follow \ngenerally accepted international practices. The WSD will maintain separate project records and \naccounts  adequate  to  identify  the  works,  goods,  and  services  to  be  financed  from  the  loan \nproceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred  under  the  project,  and  use  of \ncounterpart  funds.  The  WSD  will  ensure  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial  reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards.  \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  WSD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13).  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe country\u2019s national poverty rate was 33% in 2012, while 21% of the population was \n28. \nliving below the extreme poverty line.15 Sindh is one of the poorest provinces in Pakistan with a \nsame  poverty  rate  of  33%  as  the  national  average.  In  addition  to  long-standing  political \ninstability and security challenges, the poor condition of infrastructure inhibits economic activity \nwithin  and  outside  the  province.  The  high  rural-urban  disparity  in  Sindh  shows  that  46%  rural \n                                                \n15 Sustainable  Policy  Development  Institute.  2012.  Clustered  Deprivation:  District  Profile  of  Poverty  in  Pakistan. \n\nIslamabad. \n\n \n\n\fhouseholds  are  poor  compared  to  only  20%  urban  household,  especially  southeast  of  Sindh \n(footnote 15). The project aims to accelerate economic growth by enhancing trade and traffic in \nthe  project  areas,  and  reducing  transport  costs.  The  project  will  benefit  local  communities \n(through  improved  access  to markets  and  social  service  facilities,  and  enhanced  opportunities \nfor community networking) and the population of the wider region through the transportation of \ngoods.  About  200  households,  including  men  and  women  from  settlements  along  the  project \nroads,  participated  in  consultations  and  focus  group  discussions.  More  than  95%  of  the \nparticipants  stated  that  the  project  will  increase  economic  and  employment  opportunities  by \nimproving links to markets, production centers, and public and social service facilities. \n \n29. \nGender.  Established  sociocultural  practices  in  the  project  area  mean  that  women \nresiding  along  the  project  roads  are  unlikely  to  participate  in  civil  works  or  roadside  business \nwith construction workers or drivers.  Focus group discussions were undertaken with women in \nthe project area, and a detailed gender analysis will be conducted by a national specialist near \nthe  start  of  implementation  to  identify  priority  concerns  of  local  women.  In  preliminary \nconsultations, women said the project benefits for them would include better transport services \nand  improved  access  to  social  services,  markets,  education  and  health  facilities,  and  jobs.  \nThe  bidding  documents  provide  clauses  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors  comply  with \napplicable labor laws; do not employ child labor or forced labor; encourage the employment of \nthe  poor,  particularly  women;  and  do  not offer  different  wages to men  and  women  for  work  of \nequal value. \n \n30. \nThe prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Pakistan is 0.10% (2011). However, the potential risks of \nprevailing HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and/or communicable diseases is \nalways a concern because the main reasons for their prevalence are sexual transmissions and \nunsafe  injections,  practices  that  are  not  sufficiently  discussed  and  regulated,16 particularly  in \nKarachi  and  rural  areas.  Further,  during  and  after  implementation,  region-wide  population \nmovements  across  the  project  areas  are  expected  and  may  increase  the  risk  of  human \ntrafficking.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  project  will  increase  HIV/AIDS  incidence  during  and \nafter  implementation.  However,  any  associated  risks  will  be  minimized  by  requiring  the \ncontractor \nlocal \npopulations  during  implementation.  The  construction  supervision  consultant  and  the  executing \nagency will oversee those campaigns. The civil  works bid documents and contract will include \nthe requirement for such awareness campaigns. \n \nE. \n\ntargeting  construction  workers  and \n\nto  conduct  awareness  campaigns \n\nSafeguards \n\n31. \nEnvironment impact. The overall environmental impact is minor. The project has been \ncategorized as environment category B, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The works for each road section will be limited to reconstruction and some widening and \nwill  be  within  the  existing  right  of  way  (ROW).  The  environmental  impacts  during  the \nconstruction phase are likely to be negative but temporary, due to generation of dust, noise, and \nexhaust;  water  from  construction  and  worker  camps;  water  contamination;  violation  of \noccupational health and safety regulations; erosion; and siltation. Potential operational impacts, \nsuch  as  noise,  pollution,  and  safety  issues  caused  by  increased  traffic,  are  expected  to  be \ninsignificant. Mitigation measures to address all construction and operational impacts have been \nincluded  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  as  part  of  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination.  The  EMP  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents  and  will  be \n\n                                                \n16 Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Inter-Provincial  Coordination.  2012.

Public  consultations  were  conducted  during \nproject  preparation,  and  all  concerns  of  the  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  were \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the  EMP.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism  has  been  established  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and  complaints,  if  any,  \nfrom  affected  parties  and  to  address  them  during  construction  and  operation.  Initial \nenvironmental  examination  reports  were  prepared  for  each  road  section  and  disclosed  on  the \nADB  website  in  July  2015. The WSD  is  well  versed  with  ADB safeguard requirements,  having \nimplemented two  ADB  projects  since  2002. The PMU  and the  project management  consultant \nwill monitor the EMP. The PMU will submit biannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB, \nand these will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. ADB will conduct an initial environment training \nworkshop  for  the  PMU,  project  management  consultant,  and  contractors  before  construction \nstarts. Additional training will be provided during construction by the supervision consultant, as \nnecessary. \n\n \n32. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B,  since  it  will  affect  \n28 persons and relocate eight structures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe  design  tried  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and  minimize  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  by \nusing  the  existing  alignment  of  the  project  roads  and  the  most  feasible  technical  design.  \nThe  proposed  rehabilitation  works  will  be  within  the  ROW  limits.  However,  in  some  sections \nnear  settlements  and  along  agricultural  lands,  adjoining  landowners  have  encroached  on  the \nROW. In those cases, the width of shoulder will be reduced to avoid resettlement. The impact \nassessment and full census was conducted, based on the detailed designs and the resettlement \nplan.  The  project  will  not  have  any  land  acquisition  and  major  resettlement  impacts,  such  as \npartially  affected  structures  (permanent  structures  and  temporary  thatched  sheds  and  kiosk) \nand  trees  encroaching  into  the  ROW.  All  the  affected  households  will  restore  their  lost  part \nstructures outside of the ROW and will not be displaced physically or economically. The project \nimpacts  will  be  temporary  and  insignificant.  Affected  households  will  be  compensated  for  all \ntheir  lost  assets  at  replacement  cost;  income  restoration  support  will  be  provided  for  business \nand/or livelihood losses. The resettlement budget is $0.5 million. \n \n33. \nAffected  persons  and  the  public  along  the  project  roads  were  consulted  and  given \ninformation  about  the  project  during  the  preparation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  information \nprovided  included  the  main  features  of  the  resettlement  plan,  including  project  impacts,  asset \nvaluation, entitlements, and compensation provisions. The consultation and information-sharing \nprocess  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed to public on the WSD and ADB websites in July 2015. The WSD will regularly monitor \nthe  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  results,  including  social  monitoring,  will  be \nshared  with  ADB  during  the  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  as  well  as  biannually \nduring project implementation (after completion of the resettlement plan). The WSD, through the \nPMU, will have overall responsibility for overseeing resettlement activities. With the support of a \nsocial  safeguards  consultant,  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  finalizing,  updating,  and \nimplementing the resettlement plan, and then monitoring resettlement activities. \n \n34. \nIndigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C since the project roads are \nlocated  in  the  settled  areas  of  Sindh,  where  no  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement reside.  No  indigenous  communities  will  be  affected  by  the  project \nand, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.17 The  risks  can  be  managed  by  adopting \nmitigating measures. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of \nmitigation. \n\n \nTable 4: Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government\u2019s continually insufficient \nroad sector budget and unbalanced public \ninvestments in favor of road construction \nrather than road maintenance will result in \nunsustainability of road maintenance. \nThe deteriorating security situation will \ndelay project implementation. \n\nThe government fails to approve the Sindh \nroad master plan.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nADB will continue to encourage the provincial government to \nincrease the road sector budget annually, and to invest more on \nroad maintenance. \nADB is supporting Sindh with technical assistance on public\u2013private \npartnerships to reduce the funding gap, including in the road sector. \nMost of the roads are located in safe areas. \nThe local government will assign security forces to project sites, \npersonnel, and contractors, especially for international consultants \nand contractors. \nThe project team will consult closely with the government during \nimplementation, and brief stakeholders for each major milestone.  \nThe chief minister has appointed a working group to review and \nmonitor master plan preparation.
