THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Provincial Road Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  rehabilitate  six  provincial  highways  with  total  length  of  \n328 kilometers (km) in Sindh Province, and strengthen the institutional capacity of the provincial \nWorks & Services Department (WSD) of Sindh in road planning, maintenance, and road safety.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sindh has 23% of Pakistan\u2019s population and 18% of its land area, and generates about \n33% of gross domestic product. Sindh is the second-most populated province in Pakistan with \n42  million  people  (including  16  million  in  metropolitan  Karachi)  and  is  the  third-largest \ngeographically with an area of 140,914 square kilometers. More than 60% of Sindh\u2019s population \nlives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main source of livelihood.  \n \n4.  Because of the province\u2019s coastal access, Sindh has a highly diversified economy. \nHeavy industry and finance are centered in and around Karachi, while a substantial agricultural \nbase can be found along the Indus River. The most important crops are cotton, rice, wheat, \nsugarcane, bananas, and mangoes. Sindh is also rich in natural resources (gas, petroleum, and \ncoal), as well as renewable energy (wind and solar). Despite its economic, geographic, and \nresource advantages, recent growth and social development trends indicate that Sindh is not \nrealizing its full potential. Economic growth from 2005 to 2015 has been erratic with a trend of \ndeclining,  while  real  incomes  have  steadily fallen  since  2006. This  deterioration  has  been \ncaused by several structural constraints, including (i) a stark urban\u2013rural bifurcation of the \nprovince, which limits economic and social cohesion; (ii) poor infrastructure provision, especially \ninsufficient and unreliable road connectivity (exacerbated by massive floods in 2010 and 2011); \n(iii) increasing skills, factors, and input constraints impeded growth of production and incomes; \nand (iv) poor governance and internal security challenges.  \n \n5.  Sindh\u2019s  economic  development  is  also  unbalanced  geographically.  Karachi,  the \nprovincial capital and Pakistan\u2019s largest city, accounts for about 20% of the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product, 75% of national trade, and more than 30% of value added in large-scale \nmanufacturing. Rural Sindh, especially the poorly connected southeast part of the province, lags \nin both economic and social development with a poverty headcount double that of urban areas. \nAlmost half (46%) of the rural population lives below the poverty line and have low per capita \nincomes and calorie intake. The province\u2019s rural poor also suffer from high unemployment; \ninadequate access to education, sanitation, and health facilities; an unhygienic environment; \nand insecure access to natural resources.2 Lack of reliable, all-weather roads has contributed \nsignificantly to economic and social deprivation in rural areas. \n6.  Roads are the predominant mode of transport in Pakistan, carrying 91% of passenger \ntraffic in terms of passenger-kilometers and 96% of freight traffic in ton-kilometers.3 Transport in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sustainable Development Policy Institute. 2012. Clustered Deprivation: District Profile of Poverty in Pakistan. \nIslamabad. \n3  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2014. Pakistan Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. Islamabad. The modal \nshare for passenger-kilometers was 90.9% for roads, 5.3% for railways, and 3.8% for aviation. The modal share for \nfreight ton-kilometer was 98.8% for roads, 0.3% for railways, and 0.9% for aviation. \n ", "2 \nSindh follows a similar modal pattern. The classified paved road network of 25,737 km in Sindh \nincludes  1,365  km  of  national  highways,  2,830  km  of  provincial  highways,  11,630  km  of \nsecondary  roads,  and  9,912  km  of  improved  access  roads.  In  addition,  the  province  has \n22,000\u201354,000 km of unclassified roads, streets, and tracks.4 Much of the road network is \nspread densely along the banks of the Indus River and its major irrigation and drainage canals. \nRural road connectivity is poor in the southeastern districts of the province and along the coast. \nThe extensive arid and desert regions in the west and east of the province have few all-weather \nengineered roads. The WSD is responsible for the 14,460 km of provincial highways and \nsecondary roads, while the local district governments are responsible for all local and access \nroads. The National Highway Authority manages national highways and motorways. \n \n7.  Sindh\u2019s provincial highways, which handle traffic with a range of 3,000\u20138,000 vehicles \ndaily, connect provincial administrative and commercial centers with district headquarters and \nmarket towns. They are vital in facilitating intra-provincial trade and commerce; providing access \nto health, education, and other public services; and reducing poverty by creating jobs and \nbusiness  opportunities.  However,  the  condition  of  the  provincial  highway  system  is  below \nnational standard, and the pavement surface conditions and riding quality are deteriorating. \nMany of these roads have been upgraded from rural roads or tracks with low bearing capacity to \nsustain heavier traffic loads and resist damage from storm surges and flooding. Most provincial \nhighways have substandard geometric standards. For example, pavement widths vary from  \n5 meters (m) to 7 m (without hard shoulders) compared with a national standard 7.30 m width \n(i.e., two 3.65 m lanes) with 1.50 m hard shoulders. The pavement condition of more than half of \nthe road network is rated poor or bad. Inadequate expenditure on road maintenance and an \ninability to properly prioritize expenditures have accelerated road deterioration, resulting in an \nincrease in traffic accidents, vehicle operating costs, and travel times. \n \n8.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  $3.37  billion  in  assistance  to \nPakistan\u2019s  transport  sector,  including  loans  to the  Sindh  provincial  government to  improve \nsecondary roads and rural roads.5 In addition, ADB loans to the federal government for national \nhighways have included some sections in Sindh. However, the provincial highways, which \naccount for more than 30% of the traffic on the provincial road network and are a vital link \nbetween national highways and rural access roads, have received marginal attention\u2014despite \ngovernment efforts, such as mobilizing resources through public\u2013private partnership (PPP) and \nbilateral financing. Road rehabilitation and maintenance needs exceed the anticipated funding \nfrom these sources as well as the provincial budget. Through this project, ADB will provide \ncritical support for Sindh\u2019s high-priority road rehabilitation and maintenance program, including \npolicy and institutional assistance to sustainably maintain and preserve the provincial highways. \nADB\u2019s assistance is in line with the government\u2019s plan to upgrade the quality of the road \nnetwork, and is consistent with the strategic objectives in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2015\u201320196 regarding development of provincial highways in Pakistan. The project is included \nin ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.7 \n \n9.  Road master plan. Sindh needs to renew its road master plan, which was approved in \n1995  and  has  not  been  updated.  Although  the  government  has  invested  more  than  \nPRs100 billion in road maintenance programs from 2005 to 2015, some investments may have \nfallen short of achieving the expected outcomes because of changes in the structure and \n                                                \n4  In addition to the classified paved road system, these may include canal roads, urban roads and streets, and \nunimproved rural roads and tracks. \n5  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Bank and Pakistan: Fact Sheet. www.adb.org \n6  ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2015\u20132017. Manila. \n ", "3 \n \ncomposition of the Sindh economy. For example, some regional economic hubs developed after \n2010 need to be connected with high-quality road links. The project will support the government \nin preparing the Sindh road master plan by assessing (i) the status and condition of the overall \ntransport system, including all modes; (ii) the characteristics of transport demand and supply; \n(iii) the current and projected road traffic demand, reflecting trends in economic growth and \nregional  and  subregional  trade,  as  well  as  the  transport  modal  split;  and  (iv)  the  spatial \ndistribution, serviceability, and condition of road infrastructure.  \n \n10.  The master plan will identify the physical gaps and capacity constraints in Sindh\u2019s road \nnetwork relative to current and future traffic demand, as well as the system improvements \nneeded to satisfy the mobility and logistics requirements of a modern economy. The master plan \nwill incorporate a comprehensive medium-term road development and maintenance program \nwith  a  phased  plan  of road  investments  over a  10-year  period.  Feasibility  studies  for  the  \nhigh-priority road investments will also be included in this assignment. The master plan will \nidentify policies and complementary investments to support multimodal transport services and \nintermodal  connectivity. While  the  master  plan  will  focus  on  physical  planning,  investment \npolicies, and modalities, it will also address the institutional, financing, regulatory, and pricing \nand/or cost-recovery aspects, as well as traffic accidents, congestion, and environmental and \nsocial impacts. Moreover, the master plan will include roads and streets in metropolitan and \nurban  areas  of  Sindh.  It  will  develop  a  geographic  information  system-based  spatial  and \ncondition inventory of all roads to provide the baseline information and data for a road asset \nmanagement system. \n \n11.  Sustainable road maintenance. Annual budget allocations for road maintenance and \npreservation have been insufficient to operate and maintain the road system at an acceptable \nservice level. Road sector allocations received by the WSD have averaged about 2.0%\u20132.5% of \nSindh\u2019s annual budget; more than 50% of this allocation is spent on new road and bridge \nconstruction, and upgrading works. The expenditure on road maintenance has averaged less \nthan 1% of Sindh\u2019s annual budget. Moreover, the scarce maintenance funds are not spent in a \ncost-effective way. Road sections are subjectively selected for maintenance based on a \u201cworst \nfirst\u201d approach. Ad hoc treatments are then applied based on the experience of the responsible \nengineer. The institutional strengthening component of the project will support the development \nand operation of a modern road asset management system\u2014based on an existing one financed \nby ADB8\u2014to optimize the use of maintenance funds. The government has agreed to dedicate \nfunds in the annual budget for upgrading, data collection, and operation of the road asset \nmanagement system. Sindh also intends to increase 50% of the annual road maintenance \nbudget allocation by 2020, compared with the annual road maintenance budget for the fiscal \nyear  2016.  To  promote  sustainable  road  maintenance,  the  project  will  pilot  concessions \nsupported by road tolls for the operation and maintenance of two selected sections. \n \n12.  Private  sector  participation  in  road  sector.  Sindh  has  successfully  engaged  the \nprivate sector in transport sector through the establishment of a PPP act, policy, guidelines, and \nlegal framework. A number of PPP projects have been implemented. The WSD has identified \neight candidate road projects with a total length of 700 km for private investors. At the same \ntime, the government is also trying to engage the private sector in road maintenance through \nlong-term concessions (such as operation, maintenance, and transfer). Under such concessions, \nprivate sector entities would operate and maintain the road for a specified period after rectifying \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nmajor deficiencies in the roads and recover their costs through tolls. Sindh is one of the most \nadvanced provinces in Pakistan in terms of using PPP in the road sector. \n \n13.  Road safety and accident response. Previous ADB loans supported the government\u2019s \nefforts to improve road safety. Under the institutional strengthening component of this project, \nthe government has requested emergency response equipment for traffic police, who are first \nresponders to accidents but lack the equipment needed to safely extract crash victims at the \nscene. Police are not trained to properly move people from vehicles and provide basic first aid \nand  treatment  to  crash  victims  before  they  are  sent  to  hospitals.  The  project  will  provide \nhydraulic cutters, lifting equipment, and basic first aid equipment. Training in the use of the \nequipment and emergency response procedures will be provided. \n \n14.  Lessons  learned. Before 2009, ADB had financed road projects in each province, \nincluding ones that improved national and provincial highways, as well as rural roads. However, \neach project involved more than one executing agency, resulting in implementation difficulties. \nDespite the efforts of ADB and its counterpart agencies, significant implementation challenges \nremain in completing projects on schedule and on budget. Efficient project implementation \nrequires improvements to the procurement, safeguards, and contract management performance \nof executing agencies. While ADB interventions in Pakistan have made some progress in \nimproving the function of transport corridors, road administrations (especially in the provinces) \nstill  lack  (i)  asset  management  systems,  (ii)  sustainable  means  of  revenue  generation,  \n(iii) contract management skills, (iv) needs-based allocations of funds, (v) a maintenance focus, \nand  (vi)  a record  of compliance  with  international  safeguard  practices.9 ADB  should  avoid \nambitious  institutional  reform  targets  and  unrealistic  reform  implementation  schedules,  and \nensure  government\u2019s  ownership  and  incentives  for  institutional  strengthening.  ADB  must \nrecognize that reform is a long-term task that requires a step-by-step approach consistent with \nlocal realities.10 Other success factors for ADB projects include a stabled professional project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  extensive  monitoring  and  regular  coordination,  and  a  realistic \nimplementation schedule. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The  impact  will  be  an  efficient  and  integrated  transportation  system  established  to \nfacilitate the development of a competitive economy (Pakistan Vision 2025).11 The outcome will \nbe key sections of the provincial highway network in Sindh improved.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Project outputs are (i) about 328 km of provincial roads rehabilitated; and (ii) institutional \ncapacity of the WSD strengthened in road planning, maintenance, and road safety. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  The project is estimated to cost $227.51 million (Table 1). \n \n \n                                                \n9  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013.

Goods and civil works financed from the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Advance contracting will be considered for works, equipment, and consulting \nservices to expedite project implementation. Retroactive financing may be allowed for up to 20% \nof the loan amount, provided that expenditures are incurred during the 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan agreement. The government has been advised that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n22.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The project was prepared with project preparatory technical assistance.14 The project \ndoes not pose any significant technical challenges. Six road sections were selected based on \nthe  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the government with  consideration  of traffic  volume  and road \ncondition.  Two  roads  are  located  in  the  upper  Sindh  and  four  roads  in  lower  Sindh.  \nThe technical options include reconstruction and rehabilitation, depending on the condition of \nthe road. The treatment strategy will upgrade all roads to the standard width of 7.3 m for \ncarriageways  with  proper  drainage  and  safety  facilities.

A road safety audit was conducted for \nall roads, and the results were incorporated into the final design. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The selection of the road segments for the project and the improvement standard to be \napplied to each were based on an analysis of the project\u2019s costs and benefits. All selected \nsections have an economic internal rate of return above 12%. The economic evaluation of the \noverall  project compared  the  incremental  costs  of  building,  operating,  and  maintaining the \nproject  roads  against the  incremental  economic  benefits  arising from reductions  in  vehicle \noperating costs and travel times. The analysis was undertaken in line with standard ADB \nprocedures,  using  a  12%  discount  rate  and  20-year  appraisal  period  after  construction.  \nThe project cost\u2013benefit analysis shows that the project is economically viable, yielding an \noverall economic internal rate of return of 15.8%. \n \n25.  Traffic on the project roads currently averages about 6,000 vehicles a day. Of these, \nmore than 60% are motorcycles and rickshaws, and only 7% are heavy vehicles (e.g., vans, \ntrucks, buses, and articulated vehicles). However, heavy vehicles cause most of the road wear. \nThe  imposition  of  tolls  for  heavy  vehicles  on  two  sections  with  high  traffic  volumes  \n(Khyber\u2013Sanghar and TM Khan\u2013Badin) would generate average annual net revenue of about \nPRs135 million. This would not be sufficient to cover the repayment of investment costs, but it \nwould improve sustainability by offsetting the additional cost of operating and maintaining the \nproject roads. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The WSD\u2019s  procurement  and  financial  management  capacities  were  assessed  and \nfound to be sufficient. The WSD has implemented ADB funded projects and has adequate \ncapacity  to  undertake  procurement  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nprocedures. The WSD is also able to maintain good accounting systems, financial controls, and \naudit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing rules, and internal control systems follow \ngenerally accepted international practices. The WSD will maintain separate project records and \naccounts adequate to identify the works, goods, and services to be financed from the loan \nproceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred under the project, and use of \ncounterpart funds. The WSD  will  ensure  adequate  internal controls  and financial reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  WSD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 13).  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The country\u2019s national poverty rate was 33% in 2012, while 21% of the population was \nliving below the extreme poverty line.15 Sindh is one of the poorest provinces in Pakistan with a \nsame  poverty  rate  of  33%  as  the  national  average.  In  addition  to  long-standing  political \ninstability and security challenges, the poor condition of infrastructure inhibits economic activity \nwithin and outside the province. The high rural-urban disparity in Sindh shows that 46% rural \n                                                \n15 Sustainable Policy Development Institute. 2012. Clustered Deprivation: District Profile of Poverty in Pakistan. \nIslamabad. \n ", "8 \nhouseholds are poor compared to only 20% urban household, especially southeast of Sindh \n(footnote 15). The project aims to accelerate economic growth by enhancing trade and traffic in \nthe project areas, and reducing transport costs. The project will benefit local communities \n(through improved access to markets and social service facilities, and enhanced opportunities \nfor community networking) and the population of the wider region through the transportation of \ngoods. About 200 households, including men and women from settlements along the project \nroads,  participated  in  consultations  and  focus  group  discussions.  More  than  95%  of  the \nparticipants stated that the project will increase economic and employment opportunities by \nimproving links to markets, production centers, and public and social service facilities. \n \n29.  Gender.  Established  sociocultural  practices  in  the  project  area  mean  that  women \nresiding along the project roads are unlikely to participate in civil works or roadside business \nwith construction workers or drivers. Focus group discussions were undertaken with women in \nthe project area, and a detailed gender analysis will be conducted by a national specialist near \nthe  start  of  implementation  to  identify  priority  concerns  of  local  women.  In  preliminary \nconsultations, women said the project benefits for them would include better transport services \nand improved access to social services, markets, education and health facilities, and jobs.  \nThe bidding documents provide clauses to ensure that all civil works contractors comply with \napplicable labor laws; do not employ child labor or forced labor; encourage the employment of \nthe poor, particularly women; and do not offer different wages to men and women for work of \nequal value. \n \n30.  The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Pakistan is 0.10% (2011). However, the potential risks of \nprevailing HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and/or communicable diseases is \nalways a concern because the main reasons for their prevalence are sexual transmissions and \nunsafe injections, practices that are not sufficiently discussed and regulated,16 particularly in \nKarachi  and  rural  areas.  Further,  during  and  after  implementation,  region-wide  population \nmovements  across  the  project  areas  are  expected  and  may  increase  the  risk  of  human \ntrafficking. There is no evidence that the project will increase HIV/AIDS incidence during and \nafter  implementation.  However,  any  associated  risks  will  be  minimized  by  requiring  the \ncontractor  to  conduct  awareness  campaigns  targeting  construction  workers  and  local \npopulations during implementation. The construction supervision consultant and the executing \nagency will oversee those campaigns. The civil works bid documents and contract will include \nthe requirement for such awareness campaigns. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment impact. The overall environmental impact is minor. The project has been \ncategorized as environment category B, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The works for each road section will be limited to reconstruction and some widening and \nwill  be  within  the  existing  right  of  way  (ROW).  The  environmental  impacts  during  the \nconstruction phase are likely to be negative but temporary, due to generation of dust, noise, and \nexhaust;  water  from  construction  and  worker  camps;  water  contamination;  violation  of \noccupational health and safety regulations; erosion; and siltation. Potential operational impacts, \nsuch as noise, pollution, and safety issues caused by increased traffic, are expected to be \ninsignificant. Mitigation measures to address all construction and operational impacts have been \nincluded  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  prepared  as  part  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination. The EMP  will form part of the bidding documents and will be \n                                                \n16 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination. 2012.

Public consultations were conducted during \nproject  preparation,  and  all  concerns  of  the  affected  persons  and  stakeholders  were \nincorporated  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  and  the  EMP.  A  grievance  redress \nmechanism  has  been  established  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and  complaints,  if  any,  \nfrom  affected  parties  and  to  address  them  during  construction  and  operation.  Initial \nenvironmental examination reports were prepared for each road section and disclosed on the \nADB website in July 2015. The WSD is well versed with ADB safeguard requirements, having \nimplemented two ADB projects since 2002. The PMU and the project management consultant \nwill monitor the EMP. The PMU will submit biannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB, \nand these will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. ADB will conduct an initial environment training \nworkshop for the PMU, project management consultant, and contractors before construction \nstarts. Additional training will be provided during construction by the supervision consultant, as \nnecessary. \n \n32.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B,  since  it  will  affect  \n28 persons and relocate eight structures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe design tried to avoid land acquisition and minimize involuntary resettlement impacts by \nusing  the  existing  alignment  of  the  project  roads  and  the  most  feasible  technical  design.  \nThe proposed rehabilitation works will be within the ROW limits. However, in some sections \nnear settlements and along agricultural lands, adjoining landowners have encroached on the \nROW. In those cases, the width of shoulder will be reduced to avoid resettlement. The impact \nassessment and full census was conducted, based on the detailed designs and the resettlement \nplan. The project will not have any land acquisition and major resettlement impacts, such as \npartially affected structures (permanent structures and temporary thatched sheds and kiosk) \nand trees encroaching into the ROW. All the affected households will restore their lost part \nstructures outside of the ROW and will not be displaced physically or economically. The project \nimpacts will be temporary and insignificant. Affected households will be compensated for all \ntheir lost assets at replacement cost; income restoration support will be provided for business \nand/or livelihood losses. The resettlement budget is $0.5 million. \n \n33.  Affected persons and the public along the project roads were consulted and given \ninformation about the project during the preparation of the resettlement plan. The information \nprovided included the main features of the resettlement plan, including project impacts, asset \nvaluation, entitlements, and compensation provisions. The consultation and information-sharing \nprocess  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been \ndisclosed to public on the WSD and ADB websites in July 2015. The WSD will regularly monitor \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan. The results, including social monitoring, will be \nshared with ADB during the implementation of the resettlement plan, as well as biannually \nduring project implementation (after completion of the resettlement plan). The WSD, through the \nPMU, will have overall responsibility for overseeing resettlement activities. With the support of a \nsocial  safeguards  consultant,  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  finalizing,  updating,  and \nimplementing the resettlement plan, and then monitoring resettlement activities. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C since the project roads are \nlocated in the settled areas of Sindh, where no indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement reside. No indigenous communities will be affected by the project \nand, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The risks can be managed by adopting \nmitigating measures.
