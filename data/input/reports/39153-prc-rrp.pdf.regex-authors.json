Chronology of Major Railway Reforms  \n ", " \nLOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Transport and communications \nSubsector: Railways \nTheme: Sustainable economic growth \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, and \nfostering physical infrastructure development \n   \nEnvironment  Category C  \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The  Railway  Safety  Enhancement  Project  (the  Project)  is  a  priority \nproject included in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (FYP), 2006\u20132010, of \nthe  Government.  The  Project  is  the  first  stand-alone  sector-wide \nintervention  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  enhancing \nrailway safety on a network basis. It will promote railway safety through \nthe  introduction  of  modern  technology,  capacity  building,  and \ninstitutional development. These actions will lead to improved reliability, \nhigher mobility, increased network capacity, optimal use of the network \nand assets, and increased staff productivity\u2014all of which will lead to a \nhigher level of efficiency in railway transport in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).  \n   \nRationale  The Project reflects ADB\u2019s railway sector operational strategy for the \nPRC,  which  includes  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  by \nimproving the efficiency of railway transport through reducing railway \nnetwork constraints and enhancing railway safety. The components are \nformulated  in  line  with  the  2004  railway  development  plan  and  the \nEleventh FYP for railway development. \n \nDelays  in  rescue  and  inefficient  restoration  of  accidents  and \nemergencies contribute to loss of lives, heavy damages to goods and \npeople,  and  prolonged  disruption  of  traffic  movement  on  the  PRC \nrailway network. They are also two of the constraints preventing railways \nfrom capitalizing on their comparative advantages. \n \nThe Project will (i) introduce new and modern technology for responding \nmore quickly to emergencies, taking less restoration time and enhancing \nsafety; (ii) provide capacity building support for handling emergencies \nmore  efficiently;  and  (iii)  provide  an  institutional  framework  for \ndeveloping a quick, responsive, and efficient emergency rescue and \nrestoration system on the PRC railway network. This will help improve \nsafety and reliability, increase mobility, and reduce downtime\u2014all of \nwhich  will  help  achieve  higher  standards  of  railway  safety,  staff \nproductivity, and line capacity. \n   \nImpact and  The Project will help develop an efficient, safe, reliable, and competitive \nOutcome  railway transport system in the PRC. The outcome of the Project will be \nan efficient and effective railway emergency management system on the \n ", "ii   \nPRC railway network. This will be achieved by introducing safe, reliable, \nenergy-efficient,  and  environment-friendly  technologies;  and  by \nproviding  capacity  building  support  via  staff  training,  which  will  help \ndevelop a more responsive, quicker, and efficient rescue and restoration \nsystem for dealing with emergencies on PRC railways. \n \nThe Project comprises the following: (i) supply and installation of railway \nemergency rescue and restoration equipment, (ii) capacity building and \ntraining, and (iii) institutional development. The key inputs needed for \nproject  implementation  include  supply  of  equipment,  training,  and \nMinistry of Railways (MOR) staff inputs. \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost is estimated at $140 million.  \nPlan \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2013 \nUtilization   \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  MOR  over  5  years.  MOR  will \nArrangements  coordinate  the  project  management  tasks  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement, withdrawals, and reporting to ADB.  \n   \nProcurement  MOR will procure ADB-financed components in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts valued at or greater than $1 million will be procured through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding or \nnational competitive bidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and \nBidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  clarifications  agreed  with  ADB  as \ndetermined by the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement will \nfollow the shopping procedure. Other items, not financed by ADB, will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 5 person-months of consulting services for \nServices  strengthening the institutional and capacity development functions of the \nrailway emergency management system. Consultants will be recruited \nusing  the  quality  and  cost-based  method  (80%  technical  and  20% \nfinancial weightings) and biodata technical proposal, in accordance with \n ", "  iii \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) enhance railway safety, enabling railway users to \nand Beneficiaries  benefit  from  lower  transport  costs;  (ii)  increase  the  line  capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics \ncosts; (ii) improve staff productivity, enabling railway users to benefit \nfrom lower costs; (iv) improve environment and reduce pollution; and \n(v) reduce fuel consumption and enhance energy efficiency, enabling \nthe PRC to save valuable foreign exchange.  \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) the Government, which will \nbenefit from improved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced \nenergy bill; (ii) passengers, who will benefit from affordable, faster, and \nsafer  trips;  and  (iii)  freight  shippers,  who  will  benefit  from  reduced \ndamages to shipments and more affordable, faster, and safer trips.  \n \nSafe rail transport will benefit all passenger and shippers. The poor will \nbenefit equally or more from the intervention. The links between poverty \nand  accidents  are  apparent,  and  the  poor  are  at  a  disadvantage \nrecovering from the physical and the economic losses suffered from \ninjuries or physical loss of goods. The Project will provide an efficient \nand quick restoration system that will help reduce economic losses.  \n \nThe Project is economically sustainable. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is estimated at 57.2%.  \n   \nRisks and  Potential risks for the Project during implementation could be in the \nAssumptions  areas of financing, technology, interoperability, and procurement. These \n  have  been  assessed,  and  mitigating  measures  have  been  provided \n  based on lessons from other railway projects in the PRC. Inadequate \n  staff skills are also a risk to the Project. The project design includes a \n  capacity development program to enhance staff skills, as they are critical \n  to the success of the Project.  \n ", "100 o 00'E M O N G O L I A 120 o 00'E\nRAILWAY SAFETY INNER   MONGOLIA\nENHANCEMENT PROJECT\nto Urumqi PEOPLE'S REINP UTHBELIC OF CHINA Baotou Hohhot Jining HEBEI\nDHounagnsgh Heneg(Yellow River)Datong BEIJING Qinhuangdao\nTIANJIN\nShuoxian\nYumen Yinchuan Shenmu North Bazhou Tianjin BSoehaai\nHuanghua\nSHENMU-YAN'AN RAILWAY Yuanping Shijiazhuang\nYulin Taiyuan\nZhongwei Hengshui Yantai\nYuci Dezhou\nGantang Suide\nNINGXIA Mucun SHANXI Shehe Jinan\nSHANDONG\nQINGHAI Xining Lanzhou TAIYUAN-ZHONGWEI RAILWAY Xiaoyi Tunilu Fengteng JING-JIU RAILWAY Qingdao 35 o 00'N\nYan\u2019an North\nSHANXI-XIAOLIU RAILWAY Hancheng LinfenJiaozuoXin Xiang Yanzhou ShijiuYsueollow  Sea\n35 o 00'N Zhongjiacun TongguanHYouuemshaan Zhengzhou HeXzuezhou Linyi Lianyungang\nGANSU Baoji Xinfeng HENAN Shangqiu XinyiJIANGSU\nXi'an Qingling Tunnel\nHEFEI-XI'AN RAILWAY ZHENGZHOU-XI'AN RAILWAY Huaiyuan\nShangnan Yangping\nSICHUAN Yangpingguan SHAAAnDNkAaXXnIIAgND-aWnAjiNaGXnuIgAckNho euRXnAgiIaLWnTogAnfYXgabinxaii a MLNoisuanhntaayXinnaisanHogluinaXningycahFnuugaynDaanbieg   MounLtaHuin'seafnei CBhaennggfbeungNYaiHxnijaninnggan WJiauSnxHigNyAainnNtoGnHgAI\nDaxian HUBEI Macheng Wuhu Shanghai\nXIZANG Chengdu CHON(GWWQaanInNzxhiGaonu) Lichua(nYangtJzien RgimveerYn)ichang WHuahnakonu HEFAAEnIN-qJHIiUnUJgIIANG RAILWCAhYanHgNxaininngggbzohou\nNeijiang ChongFquilningg Huaiyuan YICHANG-WANZHOU RAILWAY Jiujiang ZHEJIANG\nScenic Area\nNanchang\nYibin\nZhongdDiaAnLI-LIJIANG RAILWCAYhang  Jiang GUIZHOU CLohuadnigsha SanjianXgiacnhgetnagng Yingtan Yiyang Wenzhou\nLijiang GUIZHOU-SHUBAI RAILWAY Huaihua HUNAZhNuzhou Ji'an JIANGXI FUJIAN\nLanping\nDukuo Liupanshui Henyang Nanping 25 o 00'N\nFuzhou\nZhanyi BaiguGouiyang Guiding Ganzhou GANZHOU-LONGYAN RAILWAY\nHongguo Pingzha\n25B oa 0o0s'Nhan Dali Chuxiong KunmiQnugjing Weishe LuochenGguilin Dingnan Longyan Xiamen\nRuili YUNNAN Yiliang Hechi GUANGXI Meizhou Zhangzhou\nSancha Longchuan\nLincang Liuzhou GUANGDONG\nKaiyuan Heshan Laibin Chaozhou\nShiping Guangzhou\nMohei Litang Sanshui Shantou\nNanning Yunfu YaCoghuangping Shenzhen GUANG-MEI-SHAN RAILWAY\nJinghong Ping Xiang Zhuhai Kowloon\nFangQchineznhgou Hepu Hechun MaMcaAoCAO SAHRONG KONG SAR\nMYANMAR VIET NAM Beihai Zhakou Maoming National Capital\nLAO PEOPLE'S Zhanjiang YAOGU-MAOMING RAILWAY Provincial Capital\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC Gulf  of Yangpu Santang City/Town\nTonkin Existing Railway\nHaikou\nNada Planned Railway\nChahe\nShilu\nBasou HAINAN Railway Projects Financed by the\nAsian Development Bank\nSanya Completed\nN\nUnder Construction\nProposed\nSouth   China   Sea\n0 50 100150200250 River\nProvincial Boundary\nKilometers International Boundary\nBoundaries are necessarily authoritative.\n100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\n07-3467 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Railway Safety Enhancement Project (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2006, \nthe PRC has experienced sustained rapid economic growth, which has resulted in a rapid \nincrease in demand for transportation. Annual growth of passenger transport was 9% and \nfreight transport grew at 7.6% during 1978\u20132006. Railways are the principal mode of freight \ntransport in the PRC. In 2006, the modal split for freight ton-kilometer (km) was 47.5% for \nrailways, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and seashore shipping, 21.1% for roads, \n3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. In 2006, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total \npassenger-km, followed by railways with 34.5%, civil aviation with 12.3%, and coastal and \ninland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport. At the \nend of 2006, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 77,000 km comprised 63,400 km of national railways \nand 13,600 km of joint venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) operates the \nstate-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local railways, \ncomprising regional lines within provincial boundaries, are constructed under the sponsorship of \nprovincial governments and/or MOR to serve local needs and provide interconnection to the \nnational railway network. Despite its large size, the railway network does not provide adequate \ncoverage for the country\u2019s population and land area.1 \n \n4.  PRC railways have the highest freight transport density in the world and second highest \npassenger  transport  density  after  Japan.  Locomotive  turnover  is  the  highest  in  the  world. \nBetween 1978 and 2006, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,172 billion ton-\nkm, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 5.14%. Passenger traffic grew at 6.65% annually \nfrom 109 billion passenger-km to 666.2 billion passenger-km. For passenger trips, the average \nrailway journey increased from 134 km in 1978 to 535 km in 2006, compared with the average \nroad journey, which grew from 35 km to 55 km over the same period. For freight, the average \nrailway journey is 770 km, compared to 65 km for road in 2006. Despite such growth rates, \nrailway capacity has lagged behind demand because of system constraints (Appendix 2). Given \nthe railways\u2019 important role in providing economic transportation, these will continue to be major \nconstraints to efficient economic growth if not removed. The Government\u2019s aggressive plan to \nimprove railways includes improving railway safety, modernizing technology, and expanding the \nrailway network. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy \n \n5.  The Government's policy on railway development focuses on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one third that of India and one tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2   \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related \nservices.  \n \n6.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP), 2001\u20132005, identified transportation, including railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. It envisaged (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide access \nto unserved areas with the network length reaching a total of 75,000 route-km; (ii) providing \n3,000 km of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; and \n(iii) increasing  operating  speeds  on  5,000  km  with  the  total  length  of  such  lines  reaching \n15,000 km. By the end of 2005, an investment of CNY308 billion had been made for capital \nconstruction, which included (i) constructing 6,458 km of new lines, (ii) providing 3,275 km of \ndouble lines, and (iii) electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. \n \n7.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway Development Plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 100,000 km by 2020. \nPriority will be given to the development of railways in unserved areas and regions that lack \ntransport  and  have  remained  less  developed.  The  route  network  length  will  increase  by \n16,000 km in the western region of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. \nThe plan identifies enhancing safety as a major goal. It seeks to ensure a high level of safety \nperformance in infrastructure construction and construction services by: (i) strictly adhering to \nsafety  regulations,  (ii)  strengthening  transport  safety  by  using  modern  and  better  quality \nequipment,  (iii)  proper  training  of  staff,  (iv)  improving  staff  education  and  technical  skills, \n(v) strengthening  responsibility  and  accountability  for  safety  in  railway  transportation,  and \n(vi) comprehensive management of public security.  \n \n8.  The Eleventh FYP, 2006\u20132010, continues to emphasize railway development and seeks \nto speed up railway construction. The plan envisages constructing 17,000 km of new lines; 45% \nof the network length will be double track and electrified. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated \npassenger railway network through the construction of 7,000 km of passenger dedicated lines \nby  2010,  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  the  capacity  of  existing  lines, \n(iii) expand the railway network in the poor western region (to reach 34,000 km), (iv) build \ninternational  corridors  at  the  borders  in  the  southwest  and  northwest,  and  (v)  develop  a \ncountrywide intermodal container network. Given the rapid development of the network, the plan \nseeks  to  enhance  safety  and  security  over  the  railway  network.  A  total  investment  of \nCNY1.5 trillion or about $190 billion (CNY1.25 trillion for construction and CNY250 billion for \nrolling stock) is planned over the next 5-year period. \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the railway sector focuses on helping \n(i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less developed areas; \n(ii) modernize railways, enhance safety, and increase capacity to improve efficiency on key \nroutes of the national railway system; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain efficient \noperations; (iv) promote energy conservation and environmental sustainability; and (v) increase \nrailway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. ADB has \nfocused on the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces to promote \n ", "  3\nsustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.2 ADB has provided 14 loans totaling about \n$2.9 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint ventures with MOR, and 5,541 km of new railway lines under the six national railway \nprojects (Appendix 4). The Project, designed to enhance safety and promote economic growth \nby providing safe and reliable railway transportation, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development \npriorities and the ADB strategy. \n \n10.  Policy Dialogue. Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB assistance to the railway \nsector and has effectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 13 technical \nassistance  (TA)  initiatives  totaling  $6.1  million  have  been  provided  for  developing  the \nemergency  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network,  institutional  development  of \ndedicated passenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the Jing\u2013Jiu \nrailway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment, human resource development, and improvement of financial management and \naccounting  systems  (Appendix  6).  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  focuses  on  (i)  poverty \nreduction  as  the  overarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB \nsafeguard  policies,  (iii)  enhancing  railway  safety,  (iv)  promoting  energy  conservation  and \nenvironmental  sustainability,  (v)  sector  reforms,  (vi)  marketing  and  business  development, \n(vii) private sector participation and nongovernment financing, and (viii) regional cooperation. \nThe railway development plan defines the major goals for the PRC railways to 2020, and is in \nbroad agreement with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. MOR\u2019s proposed reform agenda for this plan \nseeks to (i) study and learn from the best international practices gained worldwide, (ii) separate \ncore  operations  from  noncore  transportation  businesses,  (iii)  rationalize  and  reduce  staff, \n(iv) reform  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and  (v)  establish  specialized \ntransportation companies. \n \n11.  MOR  has  adopted  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement concept\u2014the asset operating liability system\u2014MOR entered into management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended to all railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.41 million in 2006. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2006  MOR  had  set  up \n3,625 diversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more \nthan 321,544 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, \nMOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. \nIn 2005, MOR completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, \nand 181 nursery schools; and 260 hospitals and medical units to local governments. One \nhundred branch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce \noperating losses. The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 7. Supplementary  Appendix A \nincludes a chronology of railway reforms. \n \n12.  Poverty Reduction. The strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector is \nto create the conditions for sustainable economic growth to help improve living standards. ADB-\nfinanced projects are located in unserved areas of the central and western part of the PRC, and \nhave  the  potential  for  economic  growth  once  improved,  cost-effective  transport  access  is \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty \nReduction. Manila. The findings conclude that completed railway projects supported general economic growth in \nthe region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway stations. \n ", "4   \nprovided. Identifying ways to enhance the poverty reduction impact has been an integral part of \nADB  interventions.  Specific  features  in  project  planning  and  design  include  (i)  providing \nemployment during construction and operation of the railways on a preferential basis to poor \nworkers, including women;3 (ii) utilizing locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) adding provisions for railway station area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and \n(v) supporting poverty reduction programs of local governments.4 ADB-financed projects have \nbeen complemented with local government development programs, such as improving the road \nnetwork and transport services in the project area concurrently with the Project, and these have \nhelped increase the welfare gains for the poor, including women, and help spread project \nbenefits to the poverty villages. \n \n13.  Energy  Conservation  and  Environmental  Sustainability.  Beginning  2006,  an \nimportant element of ADB policy dialogue with MOR has been the enhancement of energy \nconservation  and  environmental  sustainability.  The  Eleventh  FYP  of  the  Government  also \nidentifies energy conservation and environmental sustainability as the two important areas of \nsustainable  development,  and  seeks  to  formulate  plans  and  actions  to  achieve  this.  The \nemphasis  of  ADB  dialogue  has  focused  on  creating  awareness  on  these  two  issues  and \nincludes factors such as energy savings and environmental improvements in the evaluation of \nperformance of railway administrations and other entities. The dialogue encourages adopting \nenergy  efficient  technologies  and  environmental  improvements  in  railway  construction, \noperation, and maintenance. Use of fuel-efficient locomotives; double-stack container trains; \ncreating  \u201cgreen  corridors\u201d;  environment-friendly  waste  disposal;  environment-friendly  station \ndesign; and use of fuel-efficient, environment-friendly safety, and maintenance equipments are \nsome of the areas integrated in the ADB-financed project design. This area has been of mutual \ninterest to other development partners such as the World Bank, French Development Agency, \nand  German  development  cooperation  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau.  Close \ncoordination has been maintained with them. \n \n14.  Enhancing Safety. Safety is an integral part of providing competitive, high quality, and \nreliable transportation for people and goods. As PRC railways have modernized, introduced \nnew concepts and technologies, and increased speeds, the safety needs have changed. The \nEleventh FYP of MOR recognizes this important aspect and seeks to promote integrated safety \nmanagement, information network security, and an emergency management system consistent \nwith the development needs of the PRC railways. It seeks to attract foreign technology and \nexpertise  to  meet  these  needs.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  emphasizes  the  need  for \noperational reforms for the rail network, including enhancing safety in construction, operation, \nand maintenance. MOR and ADB support the safety and security objective on PRC railways \nthrough introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and \nenforcement and outreach activities (Appendix 3). Since 2003, ADB has supported investments \nin  railway  safety  as  part  of  ADB  financing,  and  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and \ntransportation  departments  of  MOR  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  on  the  institutional, \ninvestment, and training needs for safety in PRC railways. ADB also initiated dialogue on \nadopting a sector-wide approach on safety rather than a project-based approach. Adopting a \nsector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for railway operations in \n                                                 \n3  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on average and 64% \nduring peak construction.

Manila. \n ", "  5\nthe PRC; and helps in providing economies of scale and better management of emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n15.  An important element of the sector-wide approach to safety is the management of \nvarious  kinds  of  emergencies,  disasters,  and  accidents  at  different  levels  of  management \n(ministry,  railway  administration,  and  railway  station).  MOR  has  an  established  system  of \nhandling railway accidents at the three levels (Appendix 5). However, the system to deal with \nemergencies and natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons, or other natural calamities) is \nin a nascent stage. It was only after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 \nthat  MOR  first  planned  setting  up  a  mechanism  at  the  national  level  to  deal  with  natural \ndisasters and major emergencies (e.g., earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural calamities). \nMOR made a start in 2005 by establishing an emergency management office directly under the \ncontrol of the minister (as part of the minister\u2019s office). In 2006, an emergency management \ncenter was established under the transportation department.  \n \n16.  Managing emergencies and crises on a technologically advanced high-speed railway \nsystem is a new concept for PRC railways, and managing such a network is different from \nmanaging the conventional railway system. MOR has limited experience in emergency and \ncrisis management, so it sought to learn from international experience and best practices. The \nGovernment  and  MOR  requested  ADB  assistance  in  researching  and  learning  from  best \ninternational practices on an emergency management system in advanced railway systems in \ndeveloped countries, and help in adapting them to PRC railways. ADB has provided a TA grant \nof $500,000 to help develop an emergency management system on PRC railways.5 \n \n17.  Sector Reforms. ADB is supporting institutional reform of the railway sector to separate \ngovernment  and  enterprise  functions,  giving  full  play  to  market  forces  and  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness of the railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) separation of the core transport \nbusiness  from  the  noncore  transport  business,  (ii)  segmentation  of  passenger  and  freight \nservices,  and  (iii)  strengthening  of  the  recently  corporatized  specialized  transportation \ncompanies.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling \ncontainers,  special  goods,  and  express  parcel  have  been  set  up.6 Setting  up  passenger-\ndedicated corridors with a separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.7 ADB is \nassisting  in  developing  the  institutional,  marketing,  business  development,  and  technical \nstandards for such initiatives.8  \n \n18.  Rationalization of staff and reduction of transportation and non-transportation staff is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41 sub-railway administration bureaus, thereby reducing one tier of railway management. By the \nend of 2006, the number of stations and sections were reduced from 1,500 to 695. This has \nhelped reduce 22,000 staff, rationalize operations, improve productivity, and enhance efficiency. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization has intensified competition among different modes of transport and the structure of \ntransport demand is likely to change.9 ADB is providing an advisory TA for policy reform support \nto MOR,10 which is analyzing the conflicting roles of meeting social obligations and making \nprofits, increasing modal competition, impacts caused by the fast pace of urbanization and \neconomic  development,  and  demand  for  delivery  of  improved  services.  During  project \nprocessing, coordination was maintained with the World Bank, French Development Agency, \nand German development cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; and a common \napproach  to  reforms  and  assistance  was  developed.  This  will  be  continued  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n19.  Marketing and Business Development. As the PRC progresses to a market-driven \neconomy, the railways need to compete on the basis of price and service quality for demand-\nbased transportation services. New marketing and business development initiatives are needed \nboth for freight and passenger services to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has supported \nproject-specific studies to create marketing and business development opportunities, including \nskills and knowledge for market-oriented operation and awareness of profitable operations. ADB \nis supporting the development of marketing and business strategies for dedicated passenger \nlines,11 7,000 km of which is to be completed by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from \nBeijing to Tianjin is expected to start operation by August 2008.  \n \n20.  Private  Sector  Participation.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private \nsector  participation  in  the  railway  sector.  ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine \nopportunities for diversified financing sources, increased private sector involvement, and the \npossibility of public-private partnerships in the PRC railway sector. In 2005 and 2006, the State \nCouncil and MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and financing system reforms, \nwhich seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage the private sector to invest, \nand welcome strategic investors in railway financing.12 Strategic and private investors13 are \nparticipating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.14 In \n2006, an initial public offering for Daqin railway company (CNY15 billion) was made, which was \nheavily oversubscribed.  \n \n  3.

Its overall focus of building railways using \nmodern technologies addressed needs to increase railway capacity and reduce the persistent \ngap  between  demand  and  supply  as  quickly  and  efficiently  as  possible.  ADB\u2019s  priority  of \nimproving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and \nreforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways. \n \n22.  Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC \nshowed  strong  commitment  and  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing  agencies  for  project \nimplementation. The speed of implementation generally exceeded expectations at appraisal, \nand  agencies  generally  complied  with  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental \nmanagement were carried out satisfactorily. Audit covenants were complied with in a timely \nmanner, and the audited financial statements were generally acceptable (Appendix 8).

Rural income per capita in Xinfeng County increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n ", "8   \nunderemployed;20 (iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and benefited \nrural communities in inaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing \nadditional  resources  for  social  programs 21  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and \ntransportation of local materials; (vi) improved and lower cost transport resulted in lower prices \nof agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more \nincome  to  farmers;  increased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents;  and  allowed  access  to  more \nmarkets, employment opportunities, and social services beyond the immediate communities; \n(vii) counties provided with new railway access recorded higher GDP growth rates than other \ncounties; (viii) the investment environment was enhanced, resulting in rapid development of \nsecondary and tertiary industries that generated employment;22 (ix) the consequent shift in the \nstructure of employment from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity agroprocessing \nand light industry increased employment opportunities for women whose incomes and social \nstatus then improved;23 (x) tourism developed because of more affordable and convenient \nrailway travel; and (xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the \nprojects in accordance with the environmental impact assessments for the projects. The railway \nprojects have contributed to a transformation of the local economies: per capita rural incomes \nincreased substantially, living standards improved, and poverty reduced. The lessons learned \nand experiences gained are incorporated in the current project design. \n \n4.  Rationale \n24.  The project rationale reflects ADB\u2019s railway sector operational strategy for the PRC, \nwhich  includes  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  by  improving  the  efficiency  of  the \nrailway transport through reducing railway network constraints and enhancing railway safety. \nThe Project is the first stand-alone intervention by ADB for enhancing railway safety on a \nnetwork basis and will pursue the operational reforms, including emphasis on safety, with the \nintroduction  of  safe,  reliable,  and  modern  technology  on  the  railway  network;  improved \nreliability; higher mobility; increased network capacity; optimal use of the network and assets; \nand increased staff productivity. All of these will lead to higher efficiency of railway transport. \n \n25.  Safety is an important aspect of reliable transportation and a critical part of providing a \ncompetitive, high quality, and safe mode of transport for people and goods. The PRC, a country \nwith diverse geology and challenging environment, has two thirds of its areas threatened by \nfloods; nearly half of the cities located in the seismic belt; more mountainous area than plain \nareas; great elevation differences between east and west; frequent geological disasters, such \nas landslides and flow of debris; frequent typhoons in the southern part; frequent sandstorms \nand  windstorms  in  the  western  part;  and  snowstorms  in  the  northern  part.  PRC  railways \ncrisscross the length and breadth of the country, and this working environment makes managing \nsafety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n                                                 \n20 During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway (footnote 15), a total of about 7.5 million \nperson-days of employment was generated, of which 4.1 million person-days (about 55%) were provided to local \npoor people, thereby raising them above the poverty line. \n21 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi Province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \n(footnote 15) increased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998, an annual increase of 22.7% \ncompared with 12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n22 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng County of \nJiangxi Province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew from \n8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n23 Beneficial income and social impacts, particularly on women, were noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway (footnote 15) and Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway (footnote 15). \n ", "  9\n26.  As PRC railways have modernized, introduced new concepts and technologies, and \nincreased speeds, the safety needs have changed. In April 2007, train speeds were raised to \n200 km/hour (h) and 250 km/h after the sixth speedup on the PRC railway network. In 2008, the \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin dedicated passenger line, with a speed of more than 200 km/h, will be put into \noperation. Train speeds on dedicated passenger lines are expected to be increased to 300 km/h \nby 2010. Trains with higher trailing loads have been introduced on the Daqin railway line. MOR \nseeks to introduce double-stack container operation under electrified traction on the Shanghai\u2013\nChengdu corridor by 2012. By 2010, MOR seeks to set up 19,600 km of nationwide passenger \nand intercity express corridor with speed capabilities of 200 km/h and above, introduce heavy-\nhaul long freight trains with higher axle loads, increase locomotive and rolling stock utilization, \nand reduce wagon turnaround time.  \n \n27.  Managing accidents, emergencies, and crises on a technologically advanced high-speed \nrailway  system\u2014consisting  of  a  high-speed  dedicated  passenger  network24 and  a  heavily \nloaded  freight  network  in  a  difficult  and  challenging  environment\u2014needs  an  emergency \nmanagement system (emergency rescue and restoration system for dealing with accidents and \nemergencies on PRC railway network) that is reliable, technically more advanced and less \nvulnerable  to  human  error.  The  system  should  be  able  to  undertake  the  restoration  and \nmaintenance work more quickly with a high degree of reliability and be able to respond to \nemergency situations quickly. Delays in rescue and inefficient restoration can lead to loss of \nlives, heavy damages to goods and people, and prolonged disruption of traffic movement on the \nrailway network, affecting railway efficiency and preventing railways from capitalizing on their \ncomparative advantages. \n \n28.  Although the current system of emergency rescue and restoration on the PRC railways \nseems to work (Appendix 5), it has severe limitations to meet the requirements of the advanced \nrailway network under development in the PRC. Some of the major limitations are as follows: \n(i) the location of rescue and restoration centers is not commensurate with the traffic flow \ndensity and the range of operation is small (200 km), (ii) the design capacity of rescue and \nrestoration equipment is limited, (iii) equipment is old and actual capacity is less than the design \ncapacity, (iv) mobile speed of the rescue and restoration equipment is much less (maximum is \nonly 85 km/h) compared to train speed of 200\u2013250 km/h, (v) the operational speed of the \nequipment is low, (vi) safety during operation and lifting functions are not reliable, and (vii) the \nrescue and restoration time is long. All of these affect the safety, reliability, mobility, and line \ncapacity of the PRC railways. \n \n29.  The Project will help MOR improve the emergency management system by providing a \nquick, responsive rescue and restoration system on the entire railway network. The Project will \n(i) rationalize the location of the rescue and restoration centers (the location will be adjusted \naccording  to  traffic  flows  and  the  number  of  locations  will  be  reduced  from  175  to  136); \n(ii) procure equipment that is the latest available in the market, with a much higher capacity \nconsistent with the needs of current development in PRC railways; (iii) have higher operating \nspeeds (120 km/h) and lifting capacity; (iv) be provided with a safety protection system for lifting \nand operation; (v) have a self-diagnostic system; and (vi) be more versatile. All these features \nwill help in reducing the rescue and restoration time for accidents and emergencies significantly. \nThe  equipment  to  be  procured  is  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n32.  The impact of the proposed Project is an efficient, safe, reliable, and competitive railway \ntransport system developed in the PRC. The outcome of the Project will be an efficient and \neffective railway emergency management system on the PRC railway network. This will be \nachieved by introducing safe, reliable, energy-efficient, and environmental-friendly emergency \nrescue and restoration technologies; providing capacity building support through staff training; \nand rationalizing the location of the comprehensive emergency rescue and restoration centers\u2014\nall  of  which  will  help  in  developing  a  more  responsive,  quicker,  and  efficient  rescue  and \nrestoration system for dealing with accidents and emergencies on the PRC railway network. \n \nB.  Outputs \n33.  The  Project  comprises  (i)  supply  and  installation  of  railway  emergency  rescue  and \nrestoration equipment, (ii) capacity building and training, and (iii) institutional development. ADB \nwill finance (i) procurement of modern emergency rescue and restoration equipment that can \nrespond to emergencies more quickly, efficiently, and effectively; and (ii) capacity building, \nincluding  staff  training.  At  an  institutional  level,  MOR  will  rationalize  the  location  of  the \ncomprehensive emergency rescue and restoration centers (modern emergency and restoration \nequipment will be located in these centers) by reducing the number of locations from 175 to \n136, and increasing the zone of influence of the equipment from 200 km to 250 km on the PRC \nrailway network. About 250 staff will be well trained in the use of this equipment. The key inputs \nneeded for project implementation include equipment, installation, and MOR staff. \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  Network  Approach  to  Safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for \noperational reforms for the rail network, including enhancing safety, by introducing safe and \n                                                 \n25 ADB financing of the Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an dedicated passenger line in September 2005 attracted keen interest from \nother development partners such as the World Bank, French Development Agency, and German development \ncooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, which are now financing similar dedicated passenger lines. \n ", "  11\nreliable technology, modernizing maintenance systems, and capacity building. Since 2003, ADB \nhas supported investments in railway safety as part of ADB-financed projects and financed \nsafety  components  in  Dali\u2013Lijiang  Railway  Project,  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an  Railway  Project,  and \nTaiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project. This Project, however, seeks to adopt a network approach \nto safety and is a stand-alone sector-wide investment support for strengthening the emergency \nrescue and restoration management system on the PRC railway network. At an institutional \nlevel, MOR will rationalize the location of the comprehensive emergency rescue and restoration \ncenters (modern emergency and restoration equipment will be located in these centers) by \nreducing the number of locations, and increasing the zone of influence of the centers. Adopting \na sector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in \nthe PRC; and helps in providing economies of scale, and better management of emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n35.  New  Technologies.  The  Project  will  introduce  new  and  modern  technologies.  The \nequipment to be procured will be the latest available in the market, with a much higher capacity, \nconsistent with the needs of current development in the PRC railways. It will be energy-efficient \nand environment-friendly; have higher operating speeds (120 km/h) and lifting capacity; have a \nsafety protection system for lifting and operation and a self-diagnostic system; and will be more \nversatile. It can work in very cold temperatures (below \u201325\u02da centigrade), in tunnels and bridges, \nand under electrified traction. All these features will help in reducing the rescue and restoration \ntime  for  accidents  and  emergencies  significantly.  The  equipment  to  be  procured  is  not \nmanufactured nationally, and will be procured from the international market.  \n \n36.  Comprehensive  Rescue  and  Restoration  Centers.  Each  of  the  centers  will  be \ndeveloped into a comprehensive rescue and restoration center; and will have a set of rail-\nmounted  rescue  and  restoration  equipment,  tunnel  rescue  equipment,  passenger  rescue \nequipment, power generation car, tool car, medical car, and staff car. They will be formed into a \nmobile rescue and restoration unit and will be able to operate at speeds of 120 km/h (current \nspeed is about 50 km/h). The centers will be stocked with adequate spares and consumables \nfor reliable operation and maintenance of the equipment; have adequate staff well trained in the \nuse of the equipment and dealing with accidents and emergencies; and have the necessary \nmaintenance facilities and well-trained staff to maintain the equipment. This configuration will be \nplaced on all the railway administrations, six main lines, heavy-haul busy lines, and the rest of \nthe network by 2012.   \n \n37.  Capacity Development. Enhancing staff capacity is a key objective of the Project. The \nrescue center set up by each of the railway administrations (18 in total) will become centers for \ntraining of staff in rescue and restoration equipment and skills. These centers, in addition to the \nemergency  and  rescue  and  restoration  equipment  located  in  these  rescue  bases,  will  be \nequipped with simulators, training models, technical literature, and track for test operating the \nequipment. The centers will organize special courses for staff in the operation and maintenance \nof this equipment. The Project also includes capacity development programs consisting of \n(i) overseas  training  during  the  equipment  manufacturing  period,  (ii)  on-site  training  during \ninstallation and before commencement of regular operation, and (iii) training of staff at the \nabove emergency rescue centers. About 250 staff will be trained in the use of the above \nequipment. Technical exchanges on advanced technologies and new maintenance techniques \nare proposed to be organized to familiarize and educate staff in the operation and maintenance \nof this equipment.  \n \n38.  Promoting  Good  Governance. To deliver on high levels of safety and security in \nrailway transportation requires upholding and demonstrating the principles of good governance, \n ", "12  \naccountability,  transparency,  and  results-based  programs.  Setting  up  the  emergency \nmanagement system will promote good governance, as it will help consolidate the different \nfunctions under a single unit. The centers will act as one financial unit, offering better financial \nmanagement and accounting control. Administratively, they will be easier to manage, as they \nwill follow similar management control and have management autonomy. They will have well-\ndefined functions and clear targets, which will make them accountable for activities under their \ncontrol. They will support human resources development through the training functions, which \nwill be delegated to each of the 18 rescue centers. All of these steps will help promote good \ngovernance and achieve the long-term objective of continuously improving the high level of \nsafety on the PRC railway network, thereby achieving a high level of customer confidence in the \nPRC railway safety strategies. ADB-financed consulting services will assist in strengthening the \ninstitutional and capacity development functions of the emergency management system. \n \n39.  Reforms. ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue aimed at enhancing policy reforms in \nrailway safety during project processing. Significant progress has been achieved and MOR \nadopted a new Railway Safety Law on 1 September 2007, which provides an increased impetus \nto railway safety. The classification of railway accidents has been revised to include multiple \nfactors  such  as  number  of  deaths  or  injured  people;  breakdown  time  and  time  taken  for \nrestoration of services; and economic losses to railway assets during accidents as the key \nfactors. Discussions with MOR have led to the adoption of technologies for (i) training of staff for \noperation and maintenance;26 and (ii) preventive maintenance and measures to enhance safety \nduring construction, operation, and maintenance.  \n \n40.  Moving from a project-based approach on safety to a sector-wide intervention is a result \nof sector dialogue and is a significant step forward. Agreement with MOR to rationalize the \nlocation and reduce the number of the emergency rescue and restoration centers will improve \nrailway efficiency, help reduce staff, and improve staff productivity. The investment support for \nmodern  and  more-efficient  equipment  and  the  capacity  development  program  will  greatly \nimprove  the  capacity  of  rescue,  particularly  from  serious  accidents,  natural  disasters,  and \ncalamities. This will help save peoples\u2019 lives, reduce damage and loss to property, and minimize \nlosses from accidents and emergencies. The response time is expected to reduce significantly \nbecause of the increased speed, and the restoration time is expected to be reduced by 50% \nthrough the use of more efficient, higher capacity, and more versatile equipment. This will \nimprove railway efficiency and enhance railway transportation capacity. The model of financing \ndeveloped for the Project has also encouraged MOR to seek similar financing support from \nother development partners and financial institutions for railway safety.27 The intervention is well \naligned with the TA support provided for developing the emergency management system in the \nPRC. The Project will bring in new technology, emphasize safety, and build capacity for MOR. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n41.  The project investment cost is estimated at the equivalent of $140 million. Table 1 \nsummarizes the project investment plan and details are in Appendix 9. The cost estimates are \nbased on quantities derived from unit rates, reflecting market prices for goods and materials. \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB recommended MOR to use simulators for hands-on training, trouble-shooting, and checking the response and \nreaction of locomotive drivers and operating staff. MOR has purchased two locomotive simulators, placed them in \ntwo of the training institutes, and is using them for the training of drivers and other locomotive operating staff. \nThese  simulators  are  expected  to  improve  drivers\u2019  operating  skills,  and  help  in  objective  assessment  and \nevaluation of their response and reaction in the event of accidents and emergencies.    \n27 Export-Import Bank of the United States has committed $200 million for the purchase of the permanent way \nequipment for enhancing safety on tracks in 2007. \n ", "  13\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amountsa \nA.

Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum, \nconversion options  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  loan  regulations  and \nconversion guidelines, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n43.  The ADB loan will be used for financing the procurement of the equipment and training \nof staff. ADB will finance 100% of the contract packages procured under the ADB loan. MOR \nwill finance the installation cost and has made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. \nThe allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented with reference only to \ntotal  expenditure,  in  accordance  with  the  policy  on  Cost  Sharing  and  Eligibility  for  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Financing: A New Approach.28 A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 \nand details are in Appendix 9. \n \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank   100.0  71.4 \nMinistry of Railways  40.0  28.6 \n  Total  140.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2005.

MOR will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall project implementation. MOR \nwill coordinate the project management tasks and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, \nand reporting vis-\u00e0-vis ADB. MOR confirmed that the staff employed will be experienced in \nrailway engineering, financial, and administrative matters; and implementing projects financed \nby international financial institutions.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n45.  The Project will be implemented in about 5 years from January 2008 to December 2012. \nProcurement will start in January 2008 and installation will be completed in 4 years. Trial \noperations and final acceptance will be completed by December 2012 (Appendix 10). \n \n3.  Procurement \n46.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance procurement of materials and equipment as \ndescribed  in  the  procurement  plan  (Appendix  11).  Contracts  valued  equal  or  greater  than \n$1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding. Contracts valued at less \nthan $1 million will be procured through international competitive bidding or national competitive \nbidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications \nagreed with ADB as determined by the contract package. Below $100,000, procurement will \nfollow the shopping procedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to \nhandle international bidding. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) will be included in all documents and contracts during bidding for, and \nimplementation of, the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n47.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  5  person-months  of  consulting  services  to \nstrengthen  institutional  and  capacity  development  functions  of  the  emergency  management \nsystem in PRC railways. Terms of reference for the consultants\u2014to be recruited using the quality \nand cost-based method (80% technical and 20% financial weightings) and biodata technical \nproposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time)\u2014are in Appendix 12. The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be \nincluded in all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to, and discussed with, the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan regulations and  bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate to the Project. \n \n ", "  15\n49.  In relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established for \nprevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made \navailable for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division \nof MOR is located in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities \nunder the Project; and (iii) periodic inspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements are carried out. MOR shall also initiate liaison meetings with the \nprosecutor\u2019s office, on a needs basis, where any warnings about, or information on, alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project can be discussed. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts, direct payment, reimbursements, and commitment procedures will be used. If the \nGovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfollowed. The statement of expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures not exceeding $100,000 per individual payment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The payments on excess of statement of expenditures ceiling will be \nreimbursed or liquidated, based on the full supporting documentation process. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  MOR  will maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  have  such  accounts  and \nrelated financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance with auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and MOR financial statements and \nauditor\u2019s  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such  financial  statements  will  include  (i)  an \nassessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project \nexpenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an  assessment  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants and ADB requirements for project management, and (iii) an opinion on the use of the \nstatement of expenditures procedure.  \n \n52.  MOR  will  make  satisfactory  arrangements  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports. Within 3 months of completion, MOR \nwill submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  MOR agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its \nimpacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation,  include  (i)  railway  transport  indicators  (passenger  and  freight  services), \n(ii) safety indicators, and (iii) indicators for capacity development. At the beginning of project \nimplementation, MOR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators \nwill be measured at project inception, completion, and 3 years later; and compared with the \nbaseline (Appendix 13). The main sources of data include PRC railway statistics and reports \nfrom MOR. MOR will submit a report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n \n9.  Project Review \n54.  ADB and MOR will carry out review missions annually, including a midterm review in the \nthird  year  after  loan  effectiveness,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational, \n ", "16  \ntechnical, environmental, economic, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the \nperformance  of  the  Project.  The  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  policy \ndevelopment, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n55.  The project benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the Project. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and net benefits \nwill accrue to the people and the freight shippers. \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n56.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing with- and \nwithout- project situations, using constant 2007 economic prices. The Project will introduce new \nand modern technology for responding more quickly to emergencies, taking less restoration \ntime, and enhancing safety. Economic costs include costs for emergency rescue and restoration \nequipments, including installation and commissioning. Economic benefits include (i) user cost \nsavings for freight and passenger traffic; and (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight \ntraffic from buses, trucks, and other railway lines. The EIRR for the Project is estimated at \n57.2% (Appendix 14). Sensitivity analysis tested eight scenarios to assess the robustness of the \nresults of the economic analysis. The initial capital cost would have to be more than 1,154% \nhigher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \nexperience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value is unlikely to \noccur. The freight benefits would have to decrease more than 100% to make the Project \neconomically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in  completion  does  not  affect  economic  viability. \nCombinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also tested. The results showed that \nthe Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \nB.  Sustainability  \n57.  The  key  factors  for  the  sustainability  of  the  emergency  system  developed  are \n(i) availability  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance,  (ii)  availability  of  spare  parts,  and \nconsumables, and (iii) required skills of the staff that will operate this equipment. The Project is \npart of the Eleventh FYP for railway development, approved by the State Council, with clear \ntargets  for  implementation  and  financing  allocation.  MOR  has  confirmed  the  availability  of \ncounterpart  funds  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  procure  2  years  of  spare  parts  and \nconsumables for the first 2 years\u2019 operation and maintenance with the equipment procurement \nto sustain initial operations. The Government and MOR have committed to the availability of \nfunds for operation and maintenance of the equipment. Enhancing staff skills is included in the \nproject design. These include overseas training, on-site training, and training in the 18 rescue \ncenters set up at the railway administration level. Initially, 250 staff will be trained in the handing \nof this equipment.  \n \nC.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n58.  The Project is classified category C. It will have no adverse environmental impact. The \nequipment to be procured utilizes energy efficient technologies. The environmental benefits \ninclude  having  the  capacity  to  respond  more  effectively  to  railway  accidents  and  natural \ndisasters, thereby limiting any potential pollution resulting from these causes.  \n \n ", "  17\nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n59.  The aim of a safe and secure transportation system is to avoid events that result in the \nloss of or damage in life, health, and property. It also enables the efficient flow of people and \ngoods; protects the environment from pollution that can result from such events; and is an \nessential component for a healthy population, a high quality of life, and a prosperous economy. \n \n60.  The Project will (i) enhance railway safety, enabling railway users to benefit from lower \ntransport costs; (ii) increase the line capacity, benefiting consumers and producers of goods and \nservices through the provision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics costs; \n(ii) improve staff productivity, enabling railway users to benefit from lower costs; (iv) improve the \nenvironment  and  reduce  pollution;  and  (v)  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  enhance  energy \nefficiency\u2014 enabling the PRC to save valuable foreign exchange.  \n \n61.  The  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  Government,  which  will  benefit  from \nimproved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced energy bill; (ii) passengers, who will \nbenefit from affordable, faster, and safer trips; and (iii) freight shippers, who will benefit from \nreduced damages to shipments and more affordable, faster, and safer trips.  \n \n62.  Safe railway transport will benefit all passengers. The poor will benefit equally or more \nfrom the intervention. The links between poverty and accidents are apparent, and the poor are \nat a disadvantage in recovering from the physical and the economic losses suffered because of \ninjuries or physical loss of goods. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 15. The Project will provide for an efficient and quicker restoration system that will \nhelp reduce economic losses.  \n \nE.  Risks  \n63.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with previous \nrailway  projects,  traffic  demand  is  estimated  conservatively.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that \neconomic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the Project to lose \neconomic viability. Other potential risks for the Project during implementation could be financing, \ntechnology, interoperability, and procurement. These risks have been assessed and mitigating \nmeasures have been provided based on lessons from other railroad projects in the PRC. \nInadequate staff skills are also a risk to the Project. The project design includes a capacity \ndevelopment program to enhance staff skills, as they are critical to the success of the Project. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n64.  Specific  Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform measures. The Government will continue to implement the Eleventh \nFYP for railway development. \n(ii)  Equipment  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  the \nemergency  rescue  and  restoration  equipment  is  procured  and  used  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  national  technical  standards,  and  that \nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  carried  out  in  a \nperiodic and satisfactory manner.  \n \n ", "18  \n(iii)  Associated  facilities.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that \nnecessary associated facilities required for the operation of the project equipment \nare completed in a timely manner. \n \n(iv)  Supply of rolling stock. The Government will cause MOR to provide sufficient \nrolling stock at all times for effective operation of the project equipment. \n \n(v)  Sustainability.  The  Government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  (a)  adequate \ncounterpart funding, staffing, and institutional support for implementation of the \nProject; (b) that necessary measures are taken promptly to resolve any issues \nidentified  during  operation  of  the  project  equipment;  and  (c)  appropriate \nbudgetary allocations are made for the continued operation and maintenance of \nthe project equipment. \n \n(vi)  Anticorruption. In addition to ensuring compliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy,  the  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MOR  to  ensure,  that  (a)  a \nsupervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in business \npractices, and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(b) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is located in \noffices  involved  in  operational  activities  under  the  Project;  and  (c)  periodic \ninspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements are carried out.

\n \nA.  Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key Features. Despite government efforts to increase the country's transport capacity, \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the end \nof  2005,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  transport  system  comprised  about \n75,438 kilometers (km) of railways, 1.86 million km of highways, 123,300 km of inland waterways, \nand 2.05 million km of civil aviation routes. However, the density of the transport network ranks \namong the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic area. From 1978, when \neconomic reforms were first introduced, through to 2006, the PRC experienced sustained rapid \neconomic growth. This resulted in a rapid increase in demand for transportation. The annual \ngrowth  of  passenger  transport  was  7.6%  and  freight  transport  9.0%  during  1978\u20132006. \nRailways are the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC. In 2006, the modal split for \nfreight ton-km was 47.5% for railways followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-shore \nshipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. In 2006, road traffic \naccounted for 52.8% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 34.5%, civil aviation with \n12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2.  Recent  Developments.  To  improve  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased \ninvestment in transport infrastructure in the Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP), 2006\u20132010, and the \nEleventh FYP, 2006\u20132010. Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) more than doubled in the last decade. By the end of 2005, a total investment of \nCNY308 billion  for  capital  construction  was  made  for  constructing  6,458  km  of  new  lines, \nproviding 3,725 km of double lines and electrifying 6,259 km of tracks. A World Bank study1 \nindicates that total transport investment should be increased to at least 3.8% of GDP to avoid \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. To meet the increase in transport demand, \nmore infrastructure investments are needed. The Government continues to accord high priority to \ntransport.  \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. The Eleventh FYP envisages substantial \ninvestments  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing \nsources, including the private sector. It continues to emphasize railway development, and seeks \nto speed up railway construction. The plan envisages (i) constructing 17,000 km of new lines, \nand (ii) that 45% of the network length will be double-track and electrified. It seeks to (i) build a \ndedicated  passenger  railway  network  through  the  construction  of  7,000  km  of  passenger \ndedicated lines by 2010; (ii) develop coal transport corridors by increasing capacity of the \nexisting lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the poor western region (to reach 34,000 km); \n(iv) build international corridors at the borders in the southwest and northwest; and (v) develop a \ncountrywide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  or  about \n$190 billion (CNY1.25 trillion for construction and CNY250 billion for rolling stock) is planned \nover the next 5-year period (Table A4). \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 85,000 km by 2010, and to \n                                                 \n1  East Asia and Pacific Regional Office.

Increasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing \nrailways in unserved areas, and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nThe route network length will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western \nregion of the PRC by 2020. The plan calls for separating passenger and freight traffic in heavily \ntrafficked corridors, and 12,000 km of passenger dedicated corridor will be developed by 2020. \nThe plan also seeks to ensure a high level of safety performance in infrastructure construction \nand construction services by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) strengthening transport \nsafety by using modern and better quality equipment, (iii) proper training of staff, (iv) improving \nstaff education and technical skills, (v) strengthening the responsibility and accountability for \nsafety in railway transportation, and (vi) comprehensive management of public security. \n \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \ndevelopment of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the \nWorld Bank has provided 11 loans totaling $2.6 billion for 10 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced the French Development Agency in the PRC railway sector \nin 2004,3 and has since financed two railway projects. In recent years, German development \ncooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has also provided assistance to the Ministry \nof Railways (MOR) for financing three railway projects.  \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  in  the  Sector.  ADB  has  focused  on  improving  infrastructure  in  less \ndeveloped and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty. Since \n1989, ADB has provided 14 loans totaling about $2.9 billion to help finance the construction of \n1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, and 5,541 km of new railway \nlines under six national railway projects. These projects have introduced modern technology \nand improved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and structural reforms. \nADB also provided 12 technical assistance initiatives totaling about $5.6 million to promote the \ncommercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost recovery, and \nimprove railway management.  \n \n7.  Evaluation of Assistance. The evaluation4 of ADB assistance for the transport sector in \nthe PRC assessed ADB program\u2019s for railways \u201csuccessful\u201d. The evaluation noted that, in the \nrailway subsector, ADB strategic priorities were well aligned with PRC needs. Its overall focus of \nbuilding railways using modern technologies addressed needs to increase railway capacity and \nreduce the persistent gap between demand and supply as quickly and efficiently as possible. \nADB\u2019s  priority  of  improving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on \nrestructuring and reforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways.  \n \n8.  Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway projects in the PRC \nshows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the executing agencies \n                                                 \n2  In April 2007, train speed was increased to over 160 km/hour (h) on 14,000 km and 200\u2013250 km/h on 6,000 km of \nrailway lines. \n3  AFD cofinanced ($40 million) ADB. 2004.

The EAs generally complied with the loan covenants. Resettlement and \nenvironmental management were carried out satisfactorily. Audited financial statements were \nsubmitted  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the  audited  financial  statements  were  found  generally \nacceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 14 railway projects, eight are complete, two started trial operation, and \nfour are under implementation. The key lessons highlight the need to (i) ensure that the EA \nestablished  for  project  processing  and  implementation  has  adequate  capacity;  (ii) prepare \nrealistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints to traffic on a network basis, and the impact on \nproject viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and other transportation modes that \nmay  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined  debt-equity  ratios.  The  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  dramatic \ntransformation  of  local  economies.  Per  capita  rural  incomes  in  project  areas  increased \nsubstantially. Living standards were raised and poverty reduced. The project performance audit \nreport5 for the ADB-financed Jing\u2013Jiu railway project in the PRC concluded that the project was \n\u201csuccessful\u201d and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n9.  Strategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce poverty, and (iii) protect the environment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  developing  efficient  and  integrated  transport \nnetworks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty \nthrough  investment  targeting  poorer  areas,  coupled  with  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nBecause of the importance of railway transport for the development of the national economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  focuses  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor; (ii) modernizing \nrailways, enhancing safety, and increasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key \nroutes of the national railway system; (iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient \noperations;  (iv)  promoting  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability;  and \n(v) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n10.  Poverty  Reduction. ADB focuses on four issues to enhance the poverty reduction \nimpacts of transport investments: (i) locating ADB-financed projects in less developed and poor \nregions where new lines will stimulate economic development, (ii) encouraging maximization of \nemployment  of  poor  people  during  project  construction  and  operation,  (iii) supplying  local \nmaterials  that  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy  from  poor  villages,  and \n(iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen project benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n11.  Governance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  restructuring  MOR,  commercializing  operations,  supporting \nmanagement autonomy of railway operations, developing human resources, and improving \nfinancial management and accounting systems. \n \n12.  Promoting Private Sector Development. The PRC\u2019s large infrastructure needs require \nlocal governments to shift from traditional financing modes to capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue encourages \nincreased private sector participation in the railway sector. ADB is assisting MOR with a study to \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nexamine opportunities for diversified financing sources, increased private sector involvement, \nand the possibility of public-private partnerships in the PRC railway sector. Possible areas for \nprivate  participation  include  container  transportation,  setting  up  inland  container  depots, \nindustrial sidings, commercial services, tourism, parcel-related businesses, and equity stake in \nprojects. MOR has taken steps to create the conditions necessary to attract investments in the \nproject facilities and services from nongovernment and private sector sources. In 2005 and \n2006, the State Council and MOR issued guidelines on facilitating the investment and financing \nsystem reforms, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage private sector \nto invest, and welcome strategic investors in railway financing.6 Strategic and private investors7 \nare participating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.8 \nIn 2006, an initial public offering for Daqin railway company (CNY15 billion) was made, which \nwas heavily oversubscribed. \n \n13.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion, \n(ii) through  the  Xinjiang  Autonomous  Region  for  the  Central  Asian  republics  initiative,  and \n(iii) through Inner Mongolia with Mongolia. Improvement of cross-border trade regimes is a \ncommon feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the PRC, \nexpanding  regional  markets  and  options  could  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion and Central Asia Regional and Economic Cooperation programs are developing \nstrategies for transport cooperation, of which railway is an important subsector. Steps are being \ntaken to develop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport \nprojects,  e.g.,  Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  railway  development  and  the  Pan-Asian \nrailway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n14.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The Government monitors \nand evaluates sector performance annually; these are reviewed by ADB through the process of \nthe  country  partnership  strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include \n(i) economic development and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in \nrelation to land area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport \ndemand for freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway \nconstruction  surcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian \nrepublics, Greater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  China National Oil Petroleum Company is financing CNY1.7 billion for Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway line, whose \nconstruction started in July 2005 and is expected to be completed by August 2006. \n7  China Communication Construction Engineering Group, Beijing; China Engineering Construction Group, Beijing; \nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n8  ADB. 2006.

Managing safety is an important aspect of reliable transportation and critical to providing \na competitive, high quality, and safe mode of transport to people and goods. The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), a country with diverse geology and challenging environment, has two \nthirds of its areas threatened by floods; nearly half of the cities located in the seismic belt; more \nmountainous area than plain areas; great elevation differences between east and west; frequent \ngeological disasters such as landslides and flow of debris; frequent typhoons in the southern \npart; frequent sandstorms and windstorms in the western part; and snowstorms in the northern \npart.  PRC  railways  crisscross  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  country,  and  this  working \nenvironment makes managing safety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n \n2.  The  Government  and  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  attach  great  importance  to  rail \ntransport safety, and it is an important cornerstone of the PRC railway development strategy. \nSafety is an inherent element underlying all planned modernization and technological upgrading \non PRC railways. It is supported through various development plans, such as the Five-Year \nPlans, Annual Development Plans, and Long Term Railway Network Development Plan 2020, \nwhich include strategy and investments in the important area of railway safety.  \n \n3.  The Long-Term Railway Network Development Plan to 2020 (2020 Plan),1 which lays \ndown an ambitious blueprint of railway network development until 2020, envisages that safety of \nrail transport services shall be ensured by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) improving \nstaff education and technical skills through training, (iii) upgrading technology and modernizing \nequipment  for  railway  operation  and  safety,  and  (iv)  strengthening  responsibility  and \naccountability for safety in railway transport. \n \n4.  The 2020 Plan also envisages that information technology and computerization will \ncover  all  facets  of  railway  operation  and  management\u2014particularly  transport  safety  and \noperations\u2014because of the typical characteristics of the railway system. It also recognizes that \nexpansion of the railway network and technological upgrading have not been accompanied by \ninvestments and development in human resources, and seeks to provide impetus by increased \ninvestment support. MOR has adopted a proactive strategy for safety management and adopted \ninitiatives that cover technology, equipment, and human resource development through training \nand education under the 11th Five-Year Plan.  \n \n5.  PRC  railways  have  a  well  established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for the management of safety on the railways (Figure A5.1).  \n \n6.  Within MOR, the supervision of safety is the responsibility of the Safety Supervision \nBureau (SSB), which has three divisions. SSB is headed by a director general, and has the \nfollowing responsibilities: \n \n(i)  supervise the execution by railway administrations and related departments of \nthe directions, policies, laws, regulations, and instructions on safety of production \nissued by the state; \n(ii)  supervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts  and  measures  relating  to \noperational safety, non-railway personnel safety and accident treatment; \n(iii)  supervise maintenance and repair, and periodical repair of all train operation \nequipment; \n                                                 \n1  The 2020 Plan was approved by the State Council in January 2004. \n ", "  Appendix 5  29 \n(iv)  monitor  and  check  the  training,  education,  and  examination  of  staff  directly \ninvolved in train operation; urge the relevant department and unit to take effective \nmeasures to improve the quality of operation staff; \n(v)  assist in the preparation and modification of Railway Technical Management \nRegulations and other codes, regulations, instructions, and the train working \ndiagram; \n(vi)  prepare  regulations  for  treatment  of  railway  operation  accident  and  train \noperational safety supervision work; and \n(vii)  organize the relevant railway entities to carry out investigation and treatment of \nvery large train operation accident and large accidents of a serious nature; and to \nreview  and  propose  follow-up  measures  in  the  case  of  very  large  or  large \naccidents that are controversial or those that are not properly treated. \n \n7.  The three divisions of SSB have the following functions: \n \n(i)  General Division: (a) general administration of SSB; (b) carry out analysis of \naccidents on all railways, including the national railway, joint venture railway, and \nlocal railways; and (c) any other matter not covered by the other two divisions. \n(ii)  Operation Safety Division: (a) carry out investigation, determine cause(s) and \nresponsibility for operational accidents; (b) arrange and oversee training of staff \nin areas of operation safety; and (c) oversee preventive actions to be taken by \nrailway  administrations  based  on  the  recommendations  made  in  accident \ninvestigations.  \n(iii)  Labor Safety Division: (a) supervise the operational departments and entities of \nPRC  railways  with  regard  to  their  implementation  of  national  policies,  laws, \nregulations, and instructions on safety; (b) supervise the performance of staff \nresponsible for operational safety; (c) supervise labor and operational discipline \nrelevant for operational safety; (d) organize investigations and determine cause(s) \nin  the  case  of  extra  large  accidents  and  any  other  fatal  accident  that  is \nconsidered important, as a special case; and (e) carry out analysis of accidents \ninvolving staff. \n8.  The staff of SSB has expertise in railway operation and safety, including the disciplines of \ntransportation, locomotive, rolling stock, permanent way, and signaling and communications. \nStaff from any of the three divisions may be specially appointed inspector of safety supervision \nfor participation in investigations of accidents in accordance with the regulations for safety and \naccident treatment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 5 \n \nFigure A5.1: Safety Organization for Ministry of Railways \n \n \n \n  Ministry of  Director General \n  Railways \n  Safety \n  Supervision \nDeputy Director-\n  Bureau \nGeneral \n \n \n \n \n \nGeneral Division  Operation Safety  Labor Safety \n \n(Chief [1],  Division (Chief [1],  Division (Chief [1],  \n \nMembers [2])  Deputy Chief [2],  Members [2]) \n \nMembers [4]) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemaining 17 Railway \n  Railway Administration \nAdministrations  \n \nhave similar setup \n \n  Railway Administration Safety \n  Supervision Office\n \n \n \nSafety Supervision Branch \n \nOffice (one or three offices \n \nunder each Railway \n \nAdministration) \n \n \n  Safety Section at every \n  Station and Depot  \n \n \n \n  Source: Consultant based on Ministry of Railways Regulations. \n \n9.  The second level of safety management is at the railway administration level. Within the \nrailway administration, a safety supervision office is responsible for monitoring safety in the \njurisdiction of the railway administration. The safety supervision office has a dual reporting \nfunction\u2014it  reports  to  the  director  general  of  the  RA  and  submits  direct  reports  to  SSB. \nFollowing  the  dissolution  of  41  sub-railway  administrations  in  April  2005  as  part  of  the \norganizational reform, the safety supervision offices in the former sub-railway administration \nhave been reorganized into safety supervision branch offices to monitor the safety functions. \nStrengthening of the safety supervision branch offices was done by assigning additional staff \n ", "  Appendix 5  31 \nfrom those rendered surplus in the former sub-railway administrations.2 The safety supervision \nbranch offices monitor and supervise the safety functions of railway operation staff in the field \nunits (i.e., stations and depots).  \n \n10.  The third level of safety management is the field level, where every station and depot \nhas a safety section for monitoring and supervising railway operation safety functions in the field \nunit.  \n \n11.  Every year, MOR organizes a National Safety Work Meeting that reviews the work done \nin the field of safety in the past year and prepares a program of work to be done in the future for \nenhancing safety. MOR also conducts urgent inspections of railways and related facilities to \nensure safe transportation;3 and regularly issues directions to the railway administrations and \nstations for safety drills, inspections, and undertaking special preventive measures to avoid \naccidents.  \n \n12.  The structure for implementing and monitoring safety of railway operations has worked \nwell.  Continual  improvement  in  railway  operational  safety  is  evidenced  by  the  continuous \ndeclining trend in all accident statistics (Table A5). This is indicative of the efficacy of the safety \norganization. Following the dissolution of the sub-railway administrations, the strengthening of \nthe safety function in the newly constituted safety supervision branch offices was a step in the \nright direction.  \n \nTable A5: Accident Statistics of Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nNumber of Accidents  Accident Losses \nExtra Large, \nAsset in  Grievous \nYear  Total  Very Large,  Loss of life \nCNY million  Injuries \nand Large \n1990  4,126  64  40.00  166  317 \n1995  3,010  19  31.58  91  176 \n2000  827  19  44.15  65  106 \n2005  1,142  11  34.07  39  59 \nSource: Consultant based on information from Ministry of Railways. \n \n13.  With respect to the handling of accidents, a detailed procedure has been laid down for \nreporting  railway  accidents  and  incidents  to  various  levels  of  management  within  the \nGovernment and MOR. The procedure4 stipulates that the occurrence of an extra large accident \nis to be reported to the State Council within 24 hours of its occurrence. Within MOR, the \nGeneral Division of SSB is responsible for collating statistics and preparing analysis of all \naccidents on the national, joint ventures, and local railways in the PRC. The regulations5 lay \ndown in detail the procedure and responsibilities for reporting accidents, and require swift \nmeasures to be taken for rescue and relief after the occurrence of an accident to minimize \nlosses.  \n \n                                                 \n2  About 90% of the sub-railway administration staff was declared redundant. \n3  In the summer of 2000, there was a nationwide push for transportation safety after several serious accidents \nresulted in loss of life. MOR issued directions to the railway administrations and stations to check rail conditions \nwithin their areas carefully, including fire-and-flood control measures along railways; and strict regulation of \nconstruction sites and on-the-job safety. MOR issued instructions to stop any overloading of freight and passenger \ntrains and to severely punish those responsible. \n4  State Council regulation no. 34, issued in 2000 for extra large accidents and MOR3 (2000) for all other accidents. \n5  MOR Regulation No. 3, 1 July 2000. \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \n14.

The  regulations  issued  by  the  State  Council  and  MOR  detail  the  procedure  for \ninvestigation of accidents. In the event of an extra large accident, the provincial government or \nthe  relevant  department  in  charge  of  the  State  Council  (i.e.,  MOR)  should  organize  an \ninvestigation  of  the  accident.  In  such  cases,  MOR  participates  by  specially  appointing  an \ninspector of safety supervision (from SSB) to participate in the accident investigation group, \nwhich  includes  members  from  provincial  government,  public  security,  and  other  relevant \ndepartments. The investigation of accidents other than extra large is carried out by the railway \nadministrations.6  \n                                                 \n6  MOR may specifically appoint an inspector of safety supervision to investigate an accident if it is considered \nnecessary, based on the importance of the accident.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Railway Safety Enhancement Project (the Project) is a priority project included in \nthe Eleventh Five Year Plan of the Government. The Project reflects Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) railway sector operational strategy for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), which \nincludes promoting sustainable economic growth by improving the efficiency of railway transport \nthrough reducing railway network constraints and enhancing railway safety. The Project will \n(i) introduce new and modern technology for responding more quickly to emergencies\u2014taking \nless restoration time, and enhancing safety; (ii) provide capacity building support for handling \nemergencies more efficiently; and (iii) provide an institutional framework for developing a quick \nresponsive and efficient emergency rescue and restoration system on the PRC railway network. \nThis will help improve safety and reliability; increase mobility; and reduce downtime\u2014all of \nwhich will help achieve higher standards of railway safety, staff productivity, and line capacity. \nThe  consulting  services  will  assist  in  strengthening  institutional  and  capacity  development \nfunctions of the emergency management system on PRC railways. \n \nB.   Scope \n \n2.  The study will (i) review the system of emergency rescue and restoration management in \nPRC railways; (ii) identify the gaps\u2014particularly in the institutional setup of the emergency \nmanagement  centers,  facilities  for  training,  nature  of  training  programs  offered,  technical \nliterature,  quality  of  teaching  material,  and  quality  of  trainers;  (iii)  recommend  actions  and \nchanges  in  improving  these  areas;  and  (iv)  provide  training  and  capacity  enhancement \nprograms for emergency management system. The consultants will (i) make use of similar \nstudies undertaken by the Ministry of Railways (MOR), (ii) make use of experience in other \nrailways  (international),  and  (iii)  involve  active  participation  of  railway  management.  The \nconsultants  will  recommend  actions  and  changes  that  can  help  MOR  in  improving  the \nemergency  management  system  for  PRC  railways.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \nC.  Expertise and Cost Estimates \n \n3.  About  5  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  using  the  biodata \ntechnical proposal procedures based on quality and cost-based selection in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) will be included in all invitation documents and contracts for \nconsultants.

Introduction and Traffic \n \n1.  As the Railway Safety Enhancement Project (the Project) will support the entire People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) railway network, its analysis requires assessment of system-wide \ntraffic forecasts for passengers and freight over the 20-year (2013\u20132032) evaluation period. The \ntraffic  forecast  was  based  on  a  two-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on \nhistorical trends correlating socioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product (GDP) \nand propensity to travel/ship or demand for railway transport; (ii) national and regional railway \ntraffic demand based on commodity-specific analysis for major commodities currently using \n \nother  railway  lines,  roads,  and  inland  waterways. Traffic  projections  considered  expected \neconomic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism  development  potential,  local  government \ndevelopment plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical assistance consultants and \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) missions. The historical annual growth rate for tons hauled by \nthe railway was 3.82% from 1995 to 2005. For purposes of the evaluation, tons hauled are \nexpected to increase at the rate of 4.2% from 2005 to 2020, and 3% per year for 2020\u20132032. \nFor ton-kilometers (km), the growth rate is forecast at an annual rate of 5.75% for 2005 to 2020, \nand 4.5% for 2020\u20132032. The higher rate of increase for ton-km reflects the longer distances for \ncargoes based on the expansion of the network into the western PRC. Passenger forecasts are \nslightly higher, with the number of passengers increasing at an annual rate of 7.2% during the \nperiod to 2020, and 5% for 2020\u20132032. For passenger-km, the rates are 6.1% during the period \nto 2020 and 5.5% for 2020\u20132032. These forecasts are considered reasonable and in agreement \nwith Ministry of Railways forecasts. \n \nB.   Economic Evaluation \n \n2.  The  economic  evaluation  contains  a  with-Project  scenario  that  includes  the  initial \ninvestment,  and  annual  fixed  and  variable  operating  costs  (including  regular  and  overhaul \nmaintenance of equipment). The without-Project scenario is implicit to the analysis. The with-\nProject scenario is based on the analysis of 25 sets of emergency rescue and restoration \nequipment and staff training. The with-Project scenario is based on the improved response and \nrestoration times resulting from the project investment, compared to current response and \nrestoration capabilities.   \n \n3.  Cost. The analysis is based on passenger and freight traffic that would be diverted to \nbus transport for passengers, and truck and waterway transport for freight\u2014based on the \ninterruption of services in specific railway sections (current average distance for rescue and \nrestoration is an average of 100 km for 175 emergency rescue and restoration centers, which \nwill be downsized to 136 centers with an average distance for response and restoration of \n125 km). The project benefits and cost were revalued in economic prices by separating the cost \nitems into tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices \nwere expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate factor \nof 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to put an \neconomic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since no \nclear surplus of skilled workers exists. \n \n4.  Benefits. Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and passenger \ntraffic; and (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic from buses, trucks, and \nother rail lines. For passenger traffic diverted from road (3.38 million passengers in 2013), the \nuser cost saving (CNY19.60 million in 2013) is the difference in the passenger economic fare \nbetween road and rail transport (CNY0.063 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings \n(CNY0.47  million  in  2013)  are  based  on  the  difference  between  road  and  rail  transport \n(CNY0.0015 per passenger-km). \n ", "  Appendix 14  45 \n5.  For freight traffic diverted from trucks, the economic benefit (CNY139.72 million in 2013) \nis the difference in shipper economic costs between truck and rail transport (CNY0.1934 per \nton-km). For freight traffic diverted from inland waterway, the economic benefit (CNY0.12 million \nin 2013) is the difference in shipper economic costs between inland waterway and rail transport \n(CNY0.0007 per ton-km). \n6.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return for the Project is 57.2% (Table A14.1). \nSensitivity  analysis  tested  eight  scenarios  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the \neconomic analysis (Table A14.2). The initial capital cost would have to be more than 1,154% \nhigher than estimated for the economic internal rate of return to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \nConsidering the experience of ADB-financed projects in the railway sector, this switching value \nis unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to decrease more than 100% to make the \nProject economically nonviable. A 1-year delay in completion does not affect economic viability. \nCombinations of adverse effects of benefits and costs were also tested. The results showed that \nthe Project would maintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \nTable A14.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2007 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \nCosts     Benefits \nOperation  \n Year  Passenger  Freight   Net Benefits\nCapital  and  Total     Total \nTraffic  Traffic \nMaintenance \n2008  (6)  0   (6)     0   0   0   (6) \n2009  (31)  0   (31)     0   0   0   (31) \n2010  (32)  0   (32)     0   0   0   (32) \n2011  (35)  0   (35)     0   0   0   (35) \n2012  (6)  0   (6)     0   0   0   (6) \n2013  0   10   10      20   140   160   171  \n2014  0   11   11      22   148   169   180  \n2015  0   11   11      23   156   179   189  \n2016  0   11   11      25   168   193   204  \n2017  0   11   11      26   181   208   219  \n2018  0   11   11      28   194   223   234  \n2019  (7)  11   4      30   208   238   242  \n2020  0   11   11      33   221   254   265  \n2021  0   12   12      35   233   268   280  \n2022  0   12   12      37   245   282   294  \n2023  0   12   12      39   258   297   309  \n2024  0   12   12      42   270   312   324  \n2025  0   12   12      45   283   327   340  \n2026  (7)  12   5      48   301   348   354  \n2027  0   13   13      51   319   370   382  \n2028  0   13   13      54   338   392   405  \n2029  0   13   13      58   357   414   427  \n2030  0   13   13      61   376   437   451  \n2031  0   13   13      66   396   461   475  \n2032  (20)  14   (7)     69   416   485   479  \n      Economic Internal Rate of Return 57.2%\n      Economic Net Present Value @ 12% 902.58\n( ) = negative.  \nSource: Technical assistance consultant estimates. \n \n ", "46   Appendix 14 \nTable A14.2: Sensitivity Analysis \nReference  Change  Revised  Sensitivity  Switching  NPV@12% \nParameter \nValue  By  EIRR  Indicator  Value (%)a  (CNY million) \nEIRR  57.2%          902.58 \nInitial Investment    50%  46.51%  0.09  1,154.45%  863.49 \nAdditional Investment    100%  57.19%  0.00  23,510.50 898.74 \n% \nAnnual Fixed and Variable    60%  56.13%  0.05  1,872.81%  873.66 \nCosts \nTotal Costs    30%  49.61%  0.14  693.14%  863.51 \nTotal Freight Benefits    (20%)  51.59%  0.99  (100.63%)  723.19 \nTotal Passenger Benefits    (50%)  55.25%  0.15  (664.40%)  834.65 \nDelay Implementation by 1 Year    \u2014  49.89%  NPV  13.37%  781.93 \ndeclines by \nReduce Benefits by 20%;    (20%);  48.07%  1.22  (82.21%)  683.00 \nIncrease Costs by 10%  +10% \n\u2014 = not calculated, ( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \na Switching value indicates the percentage change in a variable required for the NPV to become zero. \nSource: Technical assistance consultant estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 15  47 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.
