Energy is a core sector in this strategy, which makes electric \npower infrastructure a priority within the sector. The project is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Myanmar for 2015\u20132017. 3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\n3. \nImproving  electricity  supply  in  Myanmar  to  make  it  reliable  is  critical  to  sustaining  the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  growth  and  meeting  the  government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  objectives. \nMyanmar  embarked  on  wide-ranging  economic  reforms  in  2011  that  have  resulted  in  a  rapid \nexpansion of its economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 7.2% \nduring 2011\u20132014 to $56.6 billion, and the government expects growth to average 7.1% a year \nduring  2015\u20132030.  Sustaining  this  high  growth  will  be  important  to  reducing  poverty  and \nimproving  living  conditions,  particularly  given  the  low  baseline  per  capita  GDP  of  $1,113  in \n2014. Per capita electricity consumption during the year was only 165 kilowatt-hours (kWh), and \nthe electrification rate was a low 35%.  \n \n4. \nAs  the  economy  grows  and  poverty  reduction  accelerates,  demand  for  electricity  is \nexpected to rise by 9.6% annually from 10,112 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2013 to 49,924 GWh in \n2030.  To  meet  this  rising  demand,  the  government  plans  to  expand  the  power  subsector\u2019s \nphysical  infrastructure  by  developing  new  generation  sources,  upgrading  and  expanding \ntransmission and distribution networks. It also intends to strengthen the subsector\u2019s governance \nand performance. \n \n5. \nPriority  areas  for  power  subsector  development.  With  assistance  from  ADB  and \nother development partners, the government has prepared long-term development plans for the \nenergy sector.4 The plans accord high priority in the power subsector to (i) rehabilitating existing \npower plants and constructing new ones to increase installed generation capacity to meet fast-\ngrowing demand; (ii) expanding and upgrading  the transmission grid and substations to remove \nbottlenecks and ensure that they can transmit all the power generated at the power plants to the \nload  demand  centers;  (iii)  expanding  transmission  and  distribution  networks  to  connect  more \nconsumers  to  the  electricity  grid,  particularly  in  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2013.

Manila (TA 8469-MYA). \n\n\f2 \n \n\n \n\nto \n\ntransmission  and  distribution  networks,  especially  in  the  populous  Yangon  and  Mandalay \nregions, which are the country\u2019s important commercial centers.  \n \n6. \nSubsector  governance  and  institutions.  The  power  subsector\u2019s  legal  and  regulatory \ninfrastructure has been strengthened, particularly through a new electricity law enacted in 2014. \nThe  law  provides  the  framework  for  formulating  electricity  regulations,  creating  a  regulatory \nauthority, and improving effectiveness and performance in the subsector through greater private \nsector  participation.  The  Ministry  of  Electric  Power  (MOEP)  is  in  charge  of  all  subsector \nactivities,  including  developing,  implementing,  operating,  and  maintaining  all  the  country\u2019s \nhydropower,  coal-fired,  and  gas-fired  power  plants,  as  well  as  the  power  transmission  and \ndistribution  networks.  The  MEPE,  which  is  an  operational  department  of  the  MOEP,  is \nresponsible  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  transmission  networks.5  The \nimprove  governance  and \nsubsector  has  been  undergoing  a  gradual  restructuring \ncompetitiveness.  In  2015,  the  Yangon  Electricity  Supply  Board,  which  was  previously  also  an \noperational department of MOEP, was made the Yangon Electricity Supply Corporation (YESC), \na semiautonomous stated-owned enterprise.  \n \n7. \nSystem  generation  and  transmission  planning.  The  MOEP\u2019s  generation  and \ntransmission expansion plans and the national electricity master plan provide a schedule for the \nconstruction  of  new  generation  and  transmission  projects  across  the  power  system  between \nnow and 2030. Current installed capacity totals 4,366 megawatts (MW) nationwide, consisting of \n3,005 MW  of generation  capacity  based  on  hydropower;  1,236 MW  based on gas;  a  120 MW \ncoal-fired power plant; and 5 MW using renewable energy. To meet the growing power demand, \nthe  government  aims  to  increase  total  generation  capacity  to  23,594  MW  by  2030,  including \n8,896  MW  based  on  hydropower.  The  transmission  network  will  also  need  to  be  expanded \nsignificantly  to  accommodate  the  added  power  supply.  The  country\u2019s  electricity  master  plan \nincludes construction of a 500 kV backbone grid to transmit electricity generated in the North to \nload  demand  centers  in  the  South,  along  with  230  kV  grids  that  will  branch  out  to  provide \nelectricity to support socioeconomic development, rural electrification, and poverty reduction. \n \n8. \nADB  assistance.  Since  ADB  reengaged  in  Myanmar  in  2012,  it  has  provided  $4.7 \nmillion  in  technical  assistance  to  help  the  country  strengthen  governance  and  performance  in \nthe  energy  sector  and  a  $60  million  Asian  Development  Fund  loan  to  expand  and  upgrade \nelectricity  infrastructure. 6  ADB  (i)  helped  to  develop  the  2014  electricity  law 7  and  prepare \ntransmission and distribution grid codes and electric standards and specifications; (ii)  provided \ninstitutional  support  to  the  MOEP;  (iii)  supported  a  financial  management  assessment  of  four \nstate-owned  enterprises  under  the  MOEP;  and  (iv)  assisted  the  MOEP  in  strengthening \nsafeguard  requirements  and  procedures.8 In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  Energy  for  All  initiative  provided \nassistance  to  promote  the  use  of  off-grid  solar-based  systems  to  improve  access  to  electricity \n\n                                                \n5  The MEPE is also in charge of operating and maintaining gas-fired power plants. \n6  ADB.  2013.

ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \n9. \nand the World Bank have worked closely to coordinate their assistance in the power subsector.10 \nThis assistance has included (i) loans and grants from ADB to rehabilitate distribution networks \nin  the  Magway,  Mandalay,  Sagaing,  and  Yangon  regions;  (ii)  loans  and grants from  the World \nBank to rehabilitate Thaton\u2019s gas-fired plant (108 MW); and (iii) loans and grants from JICA to \nrehabilitate  gas-fired  plants  within  Yangon  region,  and  a  hydropower  plant  and  distribution \nnetworks  in  other  townships  in  the  Yangon  region.  In  the  near  future,  ADB  plans  to  help \nstrengthen the country\u2019s 230 kV transmission and distribution networks, JICA intends to support \nconstruction  of  the  500  kV  national  transmission  backbone  and  rehabilitation  of  the  Yangon \ndistribution  network,  while  the  World  Bank  will  support  both  on-grid  and  off-grid  rural \nelectrification. 11 \n \nYangon region. The Yangon region is the country\u2019s main commercial center, economic \n10. \nhub, the  entry  point for foreign  direct  investment,  the key  initial  destination for foreign  tourists, \nand the  source of  24% of  Myanmar\u2019s  GDP. The  region  consumes  about  50%  of  the country\u2019s \nelectricity,  of  which  commercial  and  industrial  activities  account  for  a  52%  share  that  will \ncontinue  to  grow.  All  this  makes  a  reliable  supply  of  electricity  crucial  to  the  country\u2019s \nsocioeconomic  growth  and  the  strengthening  of  Yangon\u2019s  aging  and  overloaded  transmission \nand  distribution  networks  a  government  priority.  Along  with  ADB\u2019s  power  distribution  project \napproved in 2013 (footnote 6), this project will significantly improve the reliability of the electricity \nsupply in Yangon, benefitting the region\u2019s residential, commercial, and industrial consumers and \nthe country\u2019s overall development.   \n \n11. \nProject focus. Yangon\u2019s current transmission network consists mainly of 66 kV facilities \nset up as two inner rings. These 66 kV networks receive power via an incomplete outer 230 kV \nring,  which  supplies  electricity  to  the  Ahlone  and  Thaketa  substations.  Meanwhile,  the \ntransmission sections between Ahlone, Thida, and Thaketa substations still operates at 66 kV. \nThis situation requires the urgent upgrade of the transmission sections between Ahlone, Thida, \nand Thaketa substations from 66 kV to 230 kV. The MEPE is now upgrading the Ahlone\u2013Thida \nsection, and the project will upgrade the Thida\u2013Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan transmission lines to 230 kV \nand construct two new substations at South Okkalapa and West University. This will complete \nthe  critical  230  kV  ring  for  Yangon  through  substations  at  Ahlone,  Thida,  Thaketa,  South \nOkkalapa,  Hlawga,  Myang  Tagar,  West  University,  Hlaing  Thayar,  and  back  to  Ahlone.  The \nMEPE  will  be  responsible  for  connecting  the  new  South  Okkalapa  and  West  University \nsubstations  to  be  built  under  the  project  to the  rest  of  the  transmission  network.  Upon  project \ncompletion, the fully equipped 230 kV transmission ring will boost supply capacity and reliability \nand  reduce  transmission  losses.  The  MEPE  plans  to  develop  two  larger  additional  230  kV \ntransmission rings in phases. \n \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

ADB  will  use  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  and  a  single-stage  one-envelope  process  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  will  finance  the  project \nadministration  costs, the  environmental and social  safeguards measures,  and the  construction \nof  access  roads  and  staff  housing  in  substation  areas  with  counterpart  funds.  It  will  follow  its \nown procurement procedures. Further details are provided in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Consultants \n\n18. \n  The  project  will  require  209  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  117 \nperson-months  of  international  and  92  person-months  of  national  services.  The  project \nimplementation consultants (PICs) will help manage and implement the project and strengthen \nMEPE staff capacity. A consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  with  a  90:10  ratio  and  a  full  technical  proposal.  The  detailed  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\n19. \nThe  MOEP  requires  that  the  project  transmission  lines  be  overhead  lines.  The  ADB\u2019s \ntechnical due diligence recommended the use of aluminum compact core conductors (ACCCs) \nto  increase  transmission  capacity  and  of  compact  monopoles  in  combination  with  steel  lattice \ntowers where necessary.16 This approach will make construction easier, lower costs, and ensure \nthat the lines operate reliably. Compact monopoles will also minimize the land requirements for \nfootings.  ACCCs  can  carry  a  higher  electrical  load  than  usual  conductors  and  will  reduce \ntransmission losses by one percentage point. The use of n-1 criteria in the power system design \nwill improve the reliability and quality of electricity delivered to customers.17  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n20. \nEconomic  analysis. The economic viability of the project was assessed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  by  comparing  the  societal  costs  and \nbenefits  of  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios. 18 The  project  will  significantly  boost \nthe  capacity  and  reliability  of  the  power  transmission  network  in  the  Yangon  region,  thereby \nmaking greater and more dependable electricity supply available to meet the rapidly increasing \nload demand.  \n \n21.  The  project  will  generate  incremental  benefits  and  nonincremental  benefits.  The \nincremental benefits will accrue from the additional transmission capacity. Power sales will rise \n\n                                                \n16 The ACCCs are also being used for the Ahlone\u2013Thida section under MOEP financing, and their use for the Thida\u2013\n\nThaketa section will ensure conductor compatibility. \n\n17 This gives the transmission and distribution networks the ability to lose a linkage without this causing an overload \n\nfailure elsewhere. \n\n18 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nby  1,000  GWh  per  year  as  soon  as  operations  start  in  2020,  and  these  incremental  sales  will \nreach and level out at 3,300 GWh per year in 2025. The nonincremental benefits will arise from \nthe avoidance of power outages in the Yangon region, and the analysis has estimated that this \navoidance  of  power  outages  will  be  equivalent  to  1,000  megawatt-hours  per  year.  The \nincremental  electricity  sales  have been  valued  at  the  long-term  marginal cost,  estimated to  be \n$0.0932 per kWh.  \n \n22. \nThe estimated economic internal rate of return is 14.4%. The net present value at a 12% \ndiscount  rate  is  estimated  to  be  $11.9  million.  Sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  that  the  project \nwould remain economically viable under several important adverse scenarios.19  \n \n23. \n  Financial  analysis.  The  project\u2019s  financial  viability  was  examined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.20 The  MEPE  is  the  sole  buyer  and \nwholesaler  of  electricity  in Myanmar  and  purchases the  electricity from  all generation sources, \nincluding independent power producers. It sells this electricity for distribution to the YESC and \nthe  Electricity  Supply  Enterprise  (ESE),  which  is  responsible  for  electricity  distribution  outside \nYangon region. The key factors determining the MEPE\u2019s financial performance are the price of \ngas  used  for  power  generation,  the  price  at  which  it  buys  the  electricity,  and  the  wholesale \nelectricity  tariff.  In  2014,  the  purchasing  price  was  $0.02  per  kWh\u2013$0.07  per  kWh,  the \ngeneration price using gas was $0.10 per kWh, and the wholesale tariff was $0.055 per kWh for \nthe YESC and $0.05 per kWh for the ESE. \n \n24. \n  The financial analysis compared in real terms the present values of the future revenue \nand  cost  streams  of  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  incremental  project \nbenefits  to  accrue  from  the  additional  electricity  sales  made  possible  by  the  project\u2019s \ntransmission  network  upgrade  were  compared  with  the  incremental  costs  of  the  project.  The \npost-tax  financial  net  present  value  of  the  projected  incremental  cash  flows  discounted  at  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  $178  million.  The  estimated  post-tax  real  financial  internal \nrate  of  return  of  the  project  is  12.15%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of \n0.29%.  This  confirms  that  the  project  is  financially  viable.  It  remained  so  under  sensitivity \ntesting.21 \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nThe  government  regulates  electricity  tariffs.  The  tariff  is  MK35\u2013MK50  per  kWh  for \nresidential  consumers  and  MK75\u2013MK150  per  kWh  for  commercial  and  industrial  consumers, \ndepending on the consumption level. These low tariffs require the government to subsidize the \ncost  of fuel for  power  producers  and the  operations  of the  MEPE,  the  ESE,  and  the  YESC.  A \nnew  electricity  law  adopted  in  2014  opens  the  way  for  unbundling  the  power  subsector,  a \ngreater role for the private sector, and the establishment of an independent electricity regulatory \ncommission.  Under  the  law,  the  electricity  regulatory  commission  will  set  the  electricity  tariffs \nbased on the cost recovery principles and in consultation with the government. The tariff reform \nwill  aim  to  improve  efficiency  and  financial  sustainability  in  the  power  subsector,  while  also \nmeeting  the government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  objectives  by  providing  electricity  to  the  poor  with \naffordable price.  \n \n26. \nThe  government  is  committed  to  improving  governance  and  addressing  corruption.  An \nanticorruption  commission  was  formed  in  January  2013,  and  an  anticorruption  law  was \n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOEP.  ADB  will  organize  training \nsessions  for  MOEP  and  MEPE  staff  on  all  aspects  of  project  implementation  and  ADB \nguidelines  and  procedures,  including  those  for  implementation,  procurement,  recruitment  of \nconsultants, disbursement, reporting, monitoring by ADB staff and the PICs, and prevention of \nfraud and corruption by ADB staff. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27.  By  strengthening  the  power  transmission  network  in  the  Yangon  region,  the  project  will \nbuild  on  ADB\u2019s  Power  Distribution  Improvement  Project  (footnote  6),  which  is  upgrading  the \ndistribution  network  in  the  region  to  benefit  industry,  commercial  businesses,  and  residential \nconsumers.  Full  realization  of  the  project  benefits  will  depend  on  the  improvements  being \nundertaken across the entire power subsector. More than one million customers in the Yangon \nregion will benefit indirectly. \n \n28.  The project does not have a gender component or highly significant gender impacts. The \ninflux  of  male  workers  at  project  construction  sites  may  lead  to  a  high  risk  of  sexually \ntransmitted infections. To mitigate these impacts, the turnkey contracts will include requirements \nfor prevention and other health and safety measures. A code of conduct for workers is included \nin  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  PICs  will  conduct  training  sessions  and \ninformation campaigns for the PIU, local communities, and workers on gender issues, including \nthe  prevention  of  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking.  The  social  aspects  of  the  project  are \ndescribed in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy. 22 \n \n29. \nThe project is not located in areas where conflict or peace negotiations might affect the \npace  of  project  implementation.  Consultations  with  institutional  stakeholders  from  involved \nministries,  the  Yangon  city  authorities,  and  the  affected  people  did  not  identify  any  conflict-\nsensitive issues. \n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary \n30. \nresettlement,  and  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009).  Relevant  safeguard  documents  have  been  prepared  in  accordance \nwith  the  Myanmar\u2019s  laws  and  regulations  and  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  These \ninclude  (i)  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) 23 report  with  EMPs  for  all  the  project \ncomponents,  and  (ii)  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa  transmission  line  and  due \ndiligence  reports  (DDRs)  for  the  Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan  transmission  line  and  for  the  South \nOkkalapa and West University substations. 24 The safeguard documents have been disclosed on \nthe ADB website.  \n \n31. \nthe  potential \nenvironmental impacts and the measures needed to mitigate them. It included an environmental \ncompliance  audit  of  existing  facilities.  The  IEE  and  EMPs  were  prepared  in  consultation  with \naffected  communities  and stakeholders  in  the  Yangon  region  in accordance with  the  SPS  and \nMyanmar\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  The  potential  environmental  impacts  the  IEE  identified  are \nprimarily  related  to  construction. They  include  noise and dust  pollution and  sedimentation  of  a \n                                                \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nEnvironmental  safeguards.

The construction related impacts also include \nrisk  of  electric  shock,  increased  traffic  and  risk  of  traffic  accidents  near  construction  sites, \nconcerns  over  the  work  camp  waste  management  and  workers\u2019  health  and  safety.  These \nimpacts  are  site-specific  and can  be mitigated  and  managed  by  the  measures  that  have been \nincorporated into the EMPs. \n \n32. \nThe  EMPs  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents.  Prior  to  awarding  contracts,  the \nMEPE will reassess the potential environmental impacts and ensure that appropriate mitigation \nmeasures  are  in  place.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  and  monitoring  requirements  are \nspecified in the IEE and EMPs. \n \n33. \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project will involve permanent \nland  acquisition  for  the  monopoles  and  tower  footings  of  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa\u2013Kyaikasan \ntransmission  lines,  the  Kyaikasan  substation  upgrade,  the  South  Okkalapa  substation \nconstruction,  and  the  access  road  to  the  West  University  substation.  A  total  of  2,640  square \nmeters  (m2)  of  land  will  be  acquired  for  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa  transmission  line;  2,712  m2  for \nThaketa\u2013Kyaikasan  transmission  line;  and  3,875  m2  for  upgrading  the  Kyaikasan  substation. \nLand for the South Okkalapa substation (58,000 m2), belongs to the Ministry of Defense, while \nland for  the West  University  substation  belongs to  the  MOEP.  A  6,782  m2  strip  of  land  cutting \nthrough  the  properties  of  Ministry  of  Transport  and  two  private  households  will  be  acquired  to \nbuild  an  access  road  to  the  West  University  substation.  The  project  will  also  have  temporary \nimpacts during the construction of the transmission lines. \n \n34. \nThe MEPE has prepared one resettlement plan for the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line, \na DDR for the South Okkalapa and West University substations, and a DDR for the Kyaikasan\u2013\nThaketa  transmission  line.  The  resettlement  plan  for  the  Thida\u2013Thaketa  transmission  line \nidentifies 25 main structures that will be affected, and an estimated 23 households comprising \n120  people  will  be  entitled  to  compensation  at  full  replacement  cost  for  their  lost  assets, \nimplementation \nincomes,  and  businesses.  The \narrangements,  monitoring  requirements,  and  a  grievance  mechanism.  The  compensation \nbudget is included in the project costs to be financed by the MOEP.  \n \nNo  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  South  Okkalapa  and  West  University \n35. \nsubstations,  since  their  respective  DDRs  showed  that  all  the  land  will  be  acquired  through \nnegotiated  settlement.  The  MEPE  has  committed  to  independent  third-party  verification, \nconsistent  with  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  DDR  for  the  Kyaikasan\u2013Thaketa \ntransmission  line  found  that  one  household  could  be  affected  by  the  location  of  a steel  lattice \ntower. The  MEPE  has  confirmed  that  it  will  not  resort  to  expropriation  should negotiations fail. \nInstead, it will change the line alignment or the tower location. \n \nThe  project  will  not  lead  to  any  physical  relocation  or  impacts  on  communities  of \n36. \nindigenous people. None live within or close to the substations. Six ethnic minority households \nwere identified along the Thida\u2013Thaketa transmission line corridor, but they are not considered \nindigenous peoples in the context of the SPS and will not be affected by the project. \n \n37. \nThe MEPE will recruit the PICs with international and national safeguards specialists in \nenvironment and resettlement who will provide training and help the PIU implement the EMPs, \nand  resettlement  plans.  The  PICs  will  also  give  the  PIU  environmental  management  training. \nThe  estimated  budget  for  the  implementation  of  the  safeguard  mitigation  plans  has  been \nincorporated in the project implementation costs. \n \n\nresettlement  plan  also  provides \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe overall project risk is assessed to be medium. The integrated benefits and impacts \nof  the  project  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  project  costs.  The  major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.25  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nADB  helped  the  government  set  up  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission, \nwhich  will  be  tasked  with  establishing  and  implementing  tariffs  based  on \ncost-recovery principles. The World Bank is also helping  the government to \nstudy  the  impacts  of  tariff  subsidies.  Further assistance  is  planned  by  both \nADB and the World Bank. \nDevelopment partners are working closely with the  government to prioritize \ninvestment  needs  and  help  the  government  mobilize  financing  resources, \nincluding multilateral, bilateral, and private financing. \n\nRisks \nThe government may not be able to \nestablish a mechanism for setting \ntariff based on cost-recovery \nprinciples.
