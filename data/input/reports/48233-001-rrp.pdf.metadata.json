With its recent acquisitions and projects currently under development, EGCO plans \nto increase its installed renewable energy capacity to over 300 MW by 2015.3 EGCO\u2019s strategy \naligns  with  the  revised  Renewable  and  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132021, \nwhich  sets  a  target  of  generating  25%  of  primary  energy  from  renewable  sources  by  2021, \nthereby  avoiding  76  million  tons  of  carbon  emissions  annually.  Despite  Thailand\u2019s  strong \nmandate and incentives for renewable energy, only 223 MW of wind power capacity have been \ninstalled.  Significant  investment  from  the  private  sector  is  needed  to  reach  the  government\u2019s \ntarget for wind power capacity of 1,800 MW by 2021. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe project is eligible for cofinancing from the  ADB CTF.4 The Clean Technology Fund \n3. \n(CTF)  provides  concessional  financing  to  support  the  rapid  deployment  of  low-carbon \ntechnologies  with  significant  potential  to  reduce  and  avoid  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions \nover  the  long  term.  It  is  administered  through  multilateral  development  banks,  including  ADB, \nand  is  one  of  the  largest  funds  helping  developing  countries  fill  gaps  in  financing  projects  to \nmitigate  climate  change.  On  24  May  2012,  the  CTF  Trust  Fund  Committee  approved  the \nallocation of $99.5 million for the ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program, to \nbe  utilized  and  administered  by  ADB.5 The  project  is  the  fourth  private  sector  project  and  the \nsecond wind power project in Thailand under the ADB CTF, and would bring the total approved \nAD\namount \n\n$81.2  million \n\nallocation.\n\n$99.5 \n\n The \n\ntotal \n\nthe \n\nof \n\nto \n\n6\n\n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  EGCO\u2019s  current  installed  capacity  (on an equity  basis)  for renewable energy  includes  24.96  MW generated  from \n\nbiomass and waste, 123.6 MW from solar, and 6.75 MW from wind. \n4  Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n5  ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 24 May \n2012  pursuant  to  the  Financial  Procedures  Agreement  entered  into  between  ADB  and  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  as  trustee  of  the  Trust  Fund  for  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  dated  18  March \n2010. \n\n6  ADB. 2009.

Natural  gas  has  traditionally  provided \nThailand  with  a  reliable  and  low-cost  source  of  energy,  but  growing  demand  and  dwindling \nnatural  gas  reserves  from  the  Gulf  of  Thailand  mean  the  country  must  diversify  and  secure \nalternative  fuel  sources  for  power  generation.  Fortunately,  Thailand  has  abundant  renewable \nenergy  sources\u2014biomass,  biogas,  mini-hydro,  solar,  and  wind.  Using  these  domestic  sources \nof renewable energy can boost Thailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign exchange, and protect \nthe country from global price fluctuations. \n \n6. \nTo  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \ndecentralized  power  generation  through  the  country\u2019s  small  power  producer  (SPP)  program. \nThe  program  allows  private  developers  to  build,  own,  and  operate  10\u201390  MW  power  projects \nand  enter  into  a  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT). Renewable energy SPPs are also eligible for an \u201cadder\u201d incentive in addition \nto the wholesale electricity price. Government support through the SPP program and the adder \nincentive is essential for the viability and sustainability of the proposed project. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7. \nEGCO  is Thailand\u2019s first  independent  power  producer  and  currently  the  second  largest \nprivate power producer in the country.

The PPA has a 5-\nyear term with continually automatic extensions. The project will receive \nmonthly revenue by selling electricity on a single-tariff formula comprising the \ncountrywide average wholesale rate and the adder incentive of B3.5 per \nkilowatt-hour, as specified in the PPA. The adder is applicable for 10 years from \nthe start of commercial operation, at which time the project will be competitively \npriced, as it will receive only the market wholesale rate. The automatic \nextension of the contract term of each PPA will mean that, at a minimum, the \nPPA term matches the economic life of the project and exceeds the full term of \nthe debt. \n\ncosts. The long-term average cost structure is highly predictable, with limited \nexpenditure on maintenance and parts replacement and no ongoing fuel \nexpense.

The longer repayment \nprofile of the ADB loan and expected  ADB Clean Technology Fund loan and the concessional \nnature of the ADB Clean Technology Fund loan are necessary for the project to reach financial \nclose,  achieve  sound  debt  service  levels  over  the  life  of  the  project,  and  reduce  asset-liability \nmismatches  by  amortizing  the  high  up-front  costs  of  wind  power  over  the  long  term.  With  no \nongoing fuel costs, debt financing drives the cost structure and economic viability of wind power, \nand  therefore  its  sustainability  and  competitiveness  depends  on  its  ability  to  amortize  its  high \nup-front capital costs over a longer period. \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n17. \n\nADB support for the project is justified by the following: \n(i) \n\nADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping the project secure appropriate \nlong-term  financing  necessary  for  wind  power  projects  to  reach  financial  close, \nachieve sound debt service, and reduce the inherent risks associated with wind \npower  projects  arising  from  their  high  up-front  capital  costs  and  intermittent \nrevenue generation. \nADB  assistance  will  help  secure  the  necessary  financing  for  this  project  by \nreplicating  the  financing  structure  established  by  the  7.5  MW  Theppana  Wind \nPower  Project.  Theppana  served  as  a  pilot  project  for  EGCO\u2019s  entry  into  wind \npower generation and was intentionally structured on a limited recourse basis to \nprovide  a  sound  financing  structure  that  can  be  easily  replicated  by  the \nanticipated, and much larger, 81 MW Subyai Wind Power Project. \nADB assistance supports the ADB CTF program, which is playing a pivotal role in \nbuilding a critical mass of first-generation renewable energy projects in Thailand. \nDespite  Thailand\u2019s  untapped  wind \ntarget \ncommitments, and the availability of renewable energy incentives, very few wind \n\nthe  government\u2019s \n\nresources, \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                \n9  ADB will provide the ADB CTF loan as the implementing entity for the CTF. ADB will hold CTF funding for the CTF \ntranche  in  trust  prior  to  disbursing  the  loan.  The  CTF  will  assume  all  credit  risks  on  principal  and  interest \nrepayments related to its loan, and the borrower will have no recourse to ADB for the CTF tranche. Therefore, the \ntranche  will  not  count  as  ADB  exposure  to  the  project  (ADB.  2010.  Exposure  and  Investment  Limitations  on \nNonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D13/BP. Manila.). Further, as with B loans, the CTF portion will \nnot  consume  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  drawdown  for  the  CTF  is  conditional  on  the  availability  of  the  ADB \ndirect loan for drawdown. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\npower projects have achieved commercial operations due to the lack of long-term \nfinancing.  By  establishing  a  critical  mass  of  wind  power  projects,  the  ADB  CTF \nprogram aims to catalyze long-term private sector investment on a self-sustaining \nbasis, and generate the momentum needed to reach the government\u2019s ambitious \ntargets for GHG avoidance by 2021. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n18. \nThe  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  In  compliance  with  the  environmental \nassessment requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the borrower completed \nan initial environmental examination for the project. The project site and its immediate vicinity do \nnot support natural vegetation of ecological significance. The site does not provide an important \nhabitat  for  any  terrestrial  birds,  and  is  not  located  along  migratory  bird  routes.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project have been identified, and effective measures to \navoid, minimize, and mitigate them are outlined in the environmental management plan. Impacts \nduring  construction  are  short  term  and  will  be  readily  mitigated.  During  operation,  predicted \nnoise and shadow flicker effects will be studied, confirmed, and monitored. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe  cost  of  mitigation  measures  is  included  in  project  design  and  overall  project  cost.  The \nmonitoring program will record noise, shadow flicker frequency, bird and bat injury or mortality, \ncomplaints  received,  and  incidents  and  accidents.  The  borrower  will  submit  an  annual \nmonitoring report to ADB. \n \n19. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nDuring  construction,  250  workers  will  be  engaged,  mainly  as  skilled  and  unskilled \n20. \nlaborers. The borrower and its contractors will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and \nreport  annually  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards.10 Stakeholders,  including  communities  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nproject, were informed and consulted about the project. The project is categorized as having no \ngender  element,  given  its  limited  potential  for  gender-inclusive  design. 11 Sex-disaggregated \nemployment  data  will  be  collected  from  the  borrower.
