THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The 81-megawatt (MW) Subyai Wind Power Project is part of the long-term growth \nstrategy of the Electricity Generating Public Company (EGCO), which emphasizes expanding \ninvestments into renewable energy to strengthen its business in independent power generation \nin Thailand. With its recent acquisitions and projects currently under development, EGCO plans \nto increase its installed renewable energy capacity to over 300 MW by 2015.3 EGCO\u2019s strategy \naligns  with  the revised  Renewable  and  Alternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132021, \nwhich sets a target of generating 25% of primary energy from renewable sources by 2021, \nthereby  avoiding  76  million  tons  of  carbon  emissions  annually.  Despite  Thailand\u2019s  strong \nmandate and incentives for renewable energy, only 223 MW of wind power capacity have been \ninstalled. Significant investment from the private sector is needed to reach the government\u2019s \ntarget for wind power capacity of 1,800 MW by 2021. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n3.  The project is eligible for cofinancing from the ADB CTF.4 The Clean Technology Fund \n(CTF)  provides  concessional  financing  to  support  the  rapid  deployment  of  low-carbon \ntechnologies with significant potential to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nover the long term. It is administered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, \nand is one of the largest funds helping developing countries fill gaps in financing projects to \nmitigate  climate  change.  On  24  May  2012,  the  CTF Trust  Fund  Committee  approved  the \nallocation of $99.5 million for the ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program, to \nbe utilized and administered by ADB.5 The project is the fourth private sector project and the \nsecond wind power project in Thailand under the ADB CTF, and would bring the total approved \namount  to  $81.2  million  of  the  total  $99.5  allocation. 6  The  AD\n                                                \n1  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  EGCO\u2019s current installed capacity (on an equity basis) for renewable energy includes 24.96 MW generated from \nbiomass and waste, 123.6 MW from solar, and 6.75 MW from wind. \n4  Climate Investment Funds. http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. \n5  ADB Thailand Private Sector Renewable Energy Program approved by the CTF Trust Fund Committee on 24 May \n2012 pursuant to the Financial Procedures Agreement entered into between ADB and the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development as trustee of the Trust Fund for the Clean Technology Fund dated 18 March \n2010. \n6  ADB. 2009.

B CTF program is playing a pivotal role in building a critical mass of first generation \nrenewable energy projects in Thailand that will help catalyze long-term private sector investment \nin the sector on a self-sustaining basis. \n \n5.  Thailand\u2019s  electricity  production  depends  heavily  on  conventional  fuels,  with  65% \nproduced using natural gas and 21% coal and lignite. Natural gas has traditionally provided \nThailand with a reliable and low-cost source of energy, but growing demand and dwindling \nnatural gas reserves from the Gulf of Thailand mean the country must diversify and secure \nalternative fuel sources for power generation. Fortunately, Thailand has abundant renewable \nenergy sources\u2014biomass, biogas, mini-hydro, solar, and wind. Using these domestic sources \nof renewable energy can boost Thailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign exchange, and protect \nthe country from global price fluctuations. \n \n6.  To  complement  its  renewable  energy  strategy,  the  Ministry  of  Energy  advocates \ndecentralized power generation through the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) program. \nThe program allows private developers to build, own, and operate 10\u201390 MW power projects \nand enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Electricity Generating Authority of \nThailand (EGAT). Renewable energy SPPs are also eligible for an \u201cadder\u201d incentive in addition \nto the wholesale electricity price. Government support through the SPP program and the adder \nincentive is essential for the viability and sustainability of the proposed project. \n \n2.

EGCO is Thailand\u2019s first independent power producer and currently the second largest \nprivate power producer in the country. It was privatized by EGAT in 1992 and listed on the Stock \nExchange  of  Thailand  in  1995.  EGCO  is  owned  by  EGAT  (25.4%),1 TEPDIA  Generating \n(23.9%), and the public (50.7%).2 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n8.  The impact of the project will be the diversification of Thailand's energy mix by adding \nrenewable energy capacity, thus helping the country progress toward its clean energy targets.3 \nTo achieve sustainable long-term economic growth, Thailand is promoting alternative sources of \nenergy such as wind for power generation and is beginning  its transition to a low-carbon \neconomy. Wind energy is a clean and sustainable source of electricity that diversifies the \ncountry\u2019s energy mix, strengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n                                                \n1  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n2  TEPDIA Generating is jointly owned 50% by Mitsubishi and Tokyo Electric Power Company. \n3  The government has established clean energy targets of 1,800 MW of wind power by 2021 and 25% of primary \ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n ", "3 \n \n9.  The project will also contribute to accelerating and expanding private investment in clean \nenergy infrastructure. Successful project implementation and viable returns are expected to \ncatalyze other private investments in wind energy projects. \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The outcome will be the demonstrated viability and sustainability of a relatively large \nutility-scale wind project in the private sector.4 \n \n3.  Outputs \n11.  The outputs will be the installation and operation of the 81 MW wind power plant. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s midterm review of Strategy 2020, which supports \ndevelopment that is environmentally sustainable and recognizes the role of the private sector in \nmeeting growing energy demand in the region, and capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in \ninfrastructure development, finance, and other areas.5 The strategy also supports expanding \nenvironment-friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy generation and use, as well as \na larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure through public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n13.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013-2016  for \nThailand,  which  supports  three  strategic  areas:  infrastructure  development,  environmental \nsustainability,  and  support  for  the  private  sector.6 The  government\u2019s  Alternative  Energy \nDevelopment Plan, 2012\u20132021 notes the immense potential of wind power in Thailand and that \nenergy imports can be avoided through its use with private investment. The project supports the \ngovernment\u2019s long-term objective for the Thailand Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan to \nuse CTF resources to support renewable energy projects in the private sector.7 \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n14.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which emphasizes investments in \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy projects, and wider access to energy.8 It advances ADB\u2019s \ntarget of investing $2 billion per year in clean energy to accelerate low-carbon growth and \nreduce regional GHG emissions, as well as the target of ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment to receive 25% of its annual approvals, by number, for clean energy projects. \n                                                \n4  A 90 MW contract capacity wind farm under the SPP program is relatively large compared with projects developed \nunder the very small power producer program, which have contract capacity under 10 MW. \n5  ADB. 2014.

Table 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements (footnote 11). \n \nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The project is developed as a public\u2013private partnership under Thailand\u2019s small \npower producer program, which uses renewable energy from private sector \npower plants with 10\u201390 MW capacity to provide clean electricity to the grid. \nManagement  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nImplementation period  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nConstruction  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \narrangements   \nSupplier and  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \ncontractor   \nOperations   \narrangements \nRevenue structure  EGAT has committed to buying all electricity generated by the project under its \nstandard renewable energy PPA up to a maximum of 90 MW. The PPA has a 5-\nyear term with continually automatic extensions. The project will receive \nmonthly revenue by selling electricity on a single-tariff formula comprising the \ncountrywide average wholesale rate and the adder incentive of B3.5 per \nkilowatt-hour, as specified in the PPA. The adder is applicable for 10 years from \nthe start of commercial operation, at which time the project will be competitively \npriced, as it will receive only the market wholesale rate. The automatic \nextension of the contract term of each PPA will mean that, at a minimum, the \nPPA term matches the economic life of the project and exceeds the full term of \nthe debt. \nMajor cost structure  Wind power has relatively high up-front capital costs and minimal operating \ncosts. The long-term average cost structure is highly predictable, with limited \nexpenditure on maintenance and parts replacement and no ongoing fuel \nexpense. As debt financing is the only material expense, it drives the economics \nand viability of wind power projects. \nOperation and  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nmaintenance   \nRelevant parties  Revenue offtake is supported by EGAT, Thailand\u2019s state-owned utility. \nPerformance  The borrower will submit quarterly unaudited financial statements, annual \nmonitoring  audited financial statements, and semiannual environmental and social \nmonitoring reports to ADB during construction, and annually thereafter.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  The proposed assistance includes (i) a local currency loan not exceeding B1,807 million \n(or  its  equivalent  in  dollars);  and  (ii)  a  proposed  concessional  loan  from  the  ADB  Clean \nTechnology Fund not exceeding $30,000,000 or 15% of project costs, whichever is less, to be \nadministered by ADB.9 Both loans will have a tenor of up to 18.1 years. The longer repayment \nprofile of the ADB loan and expected ADB Clean Technology Fund loan and the concessional \nnature of the ADB Clean Technology Fund loan are necessary for the project to reach financial \nclose, achieve sound debt service levels over the life of the project, and reduce asset-liability \nmismatches by amortizing the high up-front costs of wind power over the long term. With no \nongoing fuel costs, debt financing drives the cost structure and economic viability of wind power, \nand therefore its sustainability and competitiveness depends on its ability to amortize its high \nup-front capital costs over a longer period. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n17.  ADB support for the project is justified by the following: \n(i)  ADB assistance will play a crucial role in helping the project secure appropriate \nlong-term financing necessary for wind power projects to reach financial close, \nachieve sound debt service, and reduce the inherent risks associated with wind \npower  projects  arising  from  their  high  up-front  capital  costs  and  intermittent \nrevenue generation. \n(ii)  ADB  assistance  will  help  secure  the  necessary  financing  for  this  project  by \nreplicating the financing structure established by the 7.5 MW Theppana Wind \nPower Project. Theppana served as a pilot project for EGCO\u2019s entry into wind \npower generation and was intentionally structured on a limited recourse basis to \nprovide  a  sound  financing  structure  that  can  be  easily  replicated  by  the \nanticipated, and much larger, 81 MW Subyai Wind Power Project. \n(iii)  ADB assistance supports the ADB CTF program, which is playing a pivotal role in \nbuilding a critical mass of first-generation renewable energy projects in Thailand. \nDespite  Thailand\u2019s  untapped  wind  resources,  the  government\u2019s  target \ncommitments, and the availability of renewable energy incentives, very few wind \n                                                \n9  ADB will provide the ADB CTF loan as the implementing entity for the CTF. ADB will hold CTF funding for the CTF \ntranche in trust prior to disbursing the loan. The CTF will assume all credit risks on principal and interest \nrepayments related to its loan, and the borrower will have no recourse to ADB for the CTF tranche. Therefore, the \ntranche will not count as ADB exposure to the project (ADB. 2010. Exposure and Investment Limitations on \nNonsovereign Operations. Operations Manual. OM D13/BP. Manila.). Further, as with B loans, the CTF portion will \nnot consume ordinary capital resources. The drawdown for the CTF is conditional on the availability of the ADB \ndirect loan for drawdown. \n ", "6 \n \npower projects have achieved commercial operations due to the lack of long-term \nfinancing. By establishing a critical mass of wind power projects, the ADB CTF \nprogram aims to catalyze long-term private sector investment on a self-sustaining \nbasis, and generate the momentum needed to reach the government\u2019s ambitious \ntargets for GHG avoidance by 2021. \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n18.  The  project  is  category  B  for  environment.  In  compliance  with  the  environmental \nassessment requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the borrower completed \nan initial environmental examination for the project. The project site and its immediate vicinity do \nnot support natural vegetation of ecological significance. The site does not provide an important \nhabitat for any terrestrial birds, and is not located along migratory bird routes. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project have been identified, and effective measures to \navoid, minimize, and mitigate them are outlined in the environmental management plan. Impacts \nduring construction are short term and will be readily mitigated. During operation, predicted \nnoise and shadow flicker effects will be studied, confirmed, and monitored. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nThe cost of mitigation measures is included in project design and overall project cost. The \nmonitoring program will record noise, shadow flicker frequency, bird and bat injury or mortality, \ncomplaints  received,  and  incidents  and  accidents.  The  borrower  will  submit  an  annual \nmonitoring report to ADB. \n \n19.  The project is category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n20.  During  construction,  250  workers  will  be  engaged,  mainly  as  skilled  and  unskilled \nlaborers. The borrower and its contractors will comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and \nreport  annually  to  ADB  on  their  compliance  with  national  labor  laws  and  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.10 Stakeholders, including communities in the vicinity of the \nproject, were informed and consulted about the project. The project is categorized as having no \ngender element, given its limited potential for gender-inclusive design.11 Sex-disaggregated \nemployment data will be collected from the borrower. The initial environmental examination \nincludes a grievance redress mechanism to receive complaints and facilitate their resolution. \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2003.
