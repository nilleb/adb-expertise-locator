Its  land  area  of  26  square \nkilometers  (km2)  covers  nine  coral  atolls  and  reef  islands  that  are  spread  across  more  than \n900,000 km2  of the Pacific  Ocean.  More  than  half  of  its  approximately 11,000  people  reside \non the 2.8 km2 island of Fongafale in the Funafuti Atoll. Tuvalu has no known mineral resources \nand  few  exports.  It  is  almost  entirely  dependent  on  external  aid  and  revenues  to  finance \nessential food and fuel imports. The government generates 88% of all economic activity and few \nopportunities exist for private sector development. 2 \n \n4. \nGiven the government\u2019s dominant role, sound management of public finance is critical to \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  performance.  The  government\u2019s  revenue  base  is  narrow  and \nsignificantly exposed to external variables. Revenues come mainly from the real income of the \ndevelopment partner-financed Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), fishing license fees, licensing royalties \nfor the commercial use of the country\u2019s top-level domain (.tv), and grants. 3 Receipts from fishing \nlicenses  and  domain  use  fees  account  for  around  40%  of  total  revenue.  Import  duties  and \nexcise and other trade taxes account for only 10% of total revenue and are unlikely to become a \ngreater source of revenue in the medium term due to Tuvalu\u2019s commitment to free trade terms \nunder the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement. 4 Government revenue is difficult to predict \naccurately and is often highly volatile. Revenues from the TTF have helped to smooth the flow \nof revenues to the government from year to year. \n \n5. \nThe TTF, which was established in 1987 to contribute to the long-term financial viability \nof Tuvalu, provides an additional source of revenue for recurrent government expenditures. The \nTTF  was  initially  capitalized  with  A$27.1  million  in  contributions  from  several  development \npartners,  including  Australia  (A$8.0  million)  and  New  Zealand  (A$8.3  million).  As  of  31  March \n2012, the trust fund\u2019s market value stood at A$122.9 million, or around 3.5 times Tuvalu\u2019s 2011 \ngross domestic product (GDP). The trust fund aims to generate a real annual rate of return of \n4.5%,  which  is  calculated  using  Australia\u2019s  consumer  price  index.  In  years  when  the  market \nvalue  of  the  trust  fund  exceeds  its  real  maintained  value,  the  surplus  is  transferred  to  the \nConsolidated Investment Fund (CIF) within the government\u2019s Consolidated Fund (its main bank \naccount) and invested in a mix of cash and fixed interest securities. The CIF also serves as a \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2012. Tuvalu: 2012 Article IV Consultation. Staff report. Washington, DC. \n3  The top-level country code internet domain for Tuvalu (.tv) is operated by dotTV, a company in the United States. \nThe Government of Tuvalu owns 20% of dotTV and receives a quarterly payment of $1 million for the use of the \ndomain. \n\n4  In  May  2010,  Tuvalu  announced  that  it  would  become  the  seventh  country  in  the  Pacific  region  to  begin  trading \nunder  the  Pacific  Island  Countries  Trade  Agreement.  On  1  July  2010,  the  government  reduced  duty  rates  in \naccordance with the free trade agreement\u2019s requirements. \n\n\frepository  for  windfall  revenues,  such  as  those  generated  from  the  lease  of  the  use  of  the  .tv \ninternet  domain  and  from  fishing  license  fees,  and  acts  as  a  revenue  stability  mechanism. \nWithdrawals  from  the  CIF  are  used  to  fund  the  recurrent  budget  as  well  as  capital \nreinvestments.  The  CIF  contributed  around  15%  of  each  of  the  annual  government  budgets \nduring 1990\u20132008. \n \n6. \nBecause  its  returns  have  fallen  short  of  the  target  in  recent  years,  the  TTF  has  not \nadded  to the  CIF  since 2008. Given  ongoing  low  returns  in the markets  in  which  the  TTF  can \ninvest,  contributions  to  the  CIF  are  unlikely  to  begin  again  until  2014.  By  this  time  the  slight \nrecovery  in  the  value  of  the  trust  fund  in  2012  and  the  shift  in  portfolio  strategy,  from  static \nbenchmark-matching  to  dynamic  targeting  of  risk  and  return,  is  expected  to  push  its  returns \nabove  its  maintained  value.  Despite  strong  efforts  by  the  government  to  contain  the  deficit  in \n2011 and modest deficit forecasts for 2012\u20132014, the government needs to rebuild the CIF to \nhelp  smooth  volatile  revenue  flows  and  provide  a  fiscal  buffer  in  the  event  of  shocks.  This  is \nparticularly important given global economic uncertainty and the fact that GDP growth in Tuvalu \nis expected to be only 1.4% in 2012 and 1.3% in 2013.  \n \n7. \nThe  economy  expanded  by  a  real  annual  rate  of  only  2.4%  per  annum  during  2007\u2013\n2011  and  Tuvalu\u2019s  growth  outlook  remains  subdued.  The  country  has  recovered  only  slowly \nfrom  the  global  economic  crisis,  which  reduced  the  value  of  the  TTF  at  the  same  time  as \ngovernment\u2019s  cash  reserves  in  the  CIF  were  being  drained  through  high  spending.  Falling \nremittances  due  to  the  decline  in  seafarer  employment  abroad  during  the  global  crisis  hurt \nhousehold  incomes.  An  unfavorable  foreign  exchange  trend  has  aggravated  these  problems. \nTuvalu\u2019s  currency,  the  Australian  dollar,  has  strengthened  against  the  US  dollar,  which  is  the \ncurrency  in  which  the  earnings  of  the  country\u2019s  international  seafarers  and  much  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s income are dominated. 5 \n \n8. \nTuvalu\u2019s growth strategy is set out in its National Strategy for Sustainable Development, \n2005\u20132015. 6 The  strategy  recognizes  that  strengthening  public  sector  management  and \nimproving the private sector environment are key drivers for change in Tuvalu. This is consistent \nwith the focus put on these goals by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific Approach as \nwell  as  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan. 7 Developing  effective  fiscal  management  to \ncomplement  private  sector  development  has  been  a  long-standing  goal  of  ADB  support  to \nTuvalu. \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n\n9. \nIn consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government developed a \nmedium-term fiscal framework in June 2012 to insulate its fiscal position from revenue volatility \nand global shocks and maintain fiscal sustainability (see table). The fiscal framework was based \non  the  government\u2019s  multiyear  policy  reform  matrix  (PRM),  prepared  in  March  2012  with  the \ncollaboration  of  ADB,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank. \nSubsequently, the projected budget outturn for 2012 reflects both planned expenditure cuts and \nalso increased grants. 8  \n\n \n\n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management; and Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6  Government of Tuvalu. 2005.

In  March  2012,  Tuvalu\u2019s  development \npartners agreed to help implement the PRM through a series of budget support operations, as \nwell as through coordinated policy dialogue and supervision; technical assistance (TA); and, in \nthe case of Australia and New Zealand, increased scholarship awards. Implementing the PRM \nwill  help  ease  the government\u2019s fiscal  constraints  by  boosting  economic growth,  improving  tax \ncollections, reducing nonpriority expenditures, and unlocking additional budget support (footnote \n2). \n \nThe PRM aims to establish a framework to make the budget sustainable and to keep the \n11. \nbudget  deficit  below  10%  of  GDP  during  2012\u20132014.  This  is  to  be  accomplished  by \nstrengthening fiscal controls, making budgeting and budget execution more effective, improving \nservice  delivery,  protecting  essential  social  services,  reforming  the  government\u2019s  public \nenterprises  (which  include  all  areas  of  government  operations  that  have  business-like \ncharacteristics, including government corporations), and increasing revenue mobilization. When \nthese reforms have been properly accomplished, Tuvalu\u2019s development partners will provide the \nbudget support that will enable the government to rebuild its reserves in the CIF (para. 6). \n \n12. \nThe  government  and  its  development  partners  appreciate  that  this  must  be  a  carefully \nsequenced  incremental  process.  ADB,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank  have \nagreed to provide financial and technical support for a government-led reform program. ADB will \nfinance  reform  measures  in  the  first  phase  of  the  PRM  for  2012.  This  will  include  identifying \nmore steps to strengthen fiscal management. The governments of Australia and New Zealand \nand the World Bank have agreed to link their provision of budget support in 2013 to the ongoing \nimplementation of these reform measures. \n \n13. \nTo restore fiscal sustainability, strong measures will also be needed to boost revenues. \nIn 2012, the government increased the Tuvalu consumption tax (TCT) rate from 3% to 4% and \nmade a greater effort to collect delinquent taxes. The 2012 budget also introduced measures to \nbring  large  public  enterprises,  particularly  the  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation,  the  Tuvalu \nTelecom  Corporation,  and  the  Vaiaku  Lagi  Hotel  (VLH),  that  are  not  paying  consumption  tax \nunder the TCT net. The government is to increase the TCT rate to 7% in 2013 and to 10% by \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f2015.  To  maintain  competitiveness  and  help  broaden  the  tax  base,  the  government  will  also \ntake steps to lower income tax rates. \n \n14. \nExpenditures  are  being  restrained  by  reducing  entitlements  and  containing  recurrent \ncosts. The government has halted allocations for government-funded scholarships and reduced \nthe accommodation component of the government-funded overseas medical treatment scheme. \nSpecial  development  expenditures,  which  are  mainly  capital  projects  for  such  things  as  boat \nramps  and  jetties  in  the  outer  island,  have  been  scaled  back.  Other  measures  that  the \ngovernment  is  considering  include  a  freeze  in  real  government  wages  in  2013  and \nimplementation of additional cost-reduction measures for the medical treatment and scholarship \nschemes. \n \nThese measures will be complemented by critically needed reforms in the government\u2019s \n15. \neight public enterprises, which dominate the country\u2019s commercial landscape. 9 Only two of them \nreported  profits  in  2011\u2014the  National  Bank  of  Tuvalu  and  the  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation. \nMost are not only loss-making\u2014and thus a burden on the government budget\u2014but also provide \nsubstandard service.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Policy and Management Capacity Issues \n\n \nTuvalu  has  a  relatively  strong  annual  budget  formulation  process  and  the  government \n16. \ncan  achieve  fiscal  discipline  and  effective  strategic  allocation  of  resources  if  it  adheres  to  its \nmedium-term  fiscal  framework. 10 However,  government  budgeting  is  weak  on  credibility  and \npredictability and budget execution is poor. This means that deficits can suddenly increase and \nthat spending agencies lack the timely, accurate financial information they need to manage their \nactivities effectively. Efficient service delivery is also undermined by the lack of a government-\nwide  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  procurement.  The  current  practice  of  purchasing \ngoods and services through established suppliers provides no guarantees that the government \nis getting value for its money. The tender process for works contracts, under the Public Tenders \nBoard  regulations,  lacks  all  the  checks  and  balances  needed  to  ensure  that  procurement  is \ncompetitive and transparent. 11   \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Enterprise Reform Issues \n\n17. \nADB\u2019s  first  policy-based  program  in  Tuvalu\u2014the  Improved  Financial  Management \nProgram\u2014was  instrumental  in  addressing  weaknesses  in  government  oversight  of  public \nenterprises. 12  The  program  built  on  previous  ADB  support  for  public  sector  management, \nincluding the TA for capacity development for public financial management, which supported the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  its  public  enterprise  reform  program. 13  It  contributed  to \ngovernment approval of a Public Enterprise Reform Policy in 2009 and enactment of the Public \n\n                                                \n9  Tuvalu\u2019s public enterprises are the National Bank of Tuvalu, the Development Bank of Tuvalu, the National Fishing \nCompany  of  Tuvalu,  the  Tuvalu  Telecommunications  Corporation,  the  Vaiaku  Lagi  Hotel,  the  Tuvalu  Electricity \nCorporation, the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute, and the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau. \n\n10 Tuvalu has been classified as fragile situation since 2008. The 2012 country performance assessment highlights \neconomic  management,  in  particular  debt  policy,  and  structural  policies,  in  particular  the  financial  sector  and \nbusiness regulatory environment, as being particularly weak. \n\n11  Government  of  Tuvalu.  2011.

Technical  Assistance  to  Tuvalu  for  Capacity  Development  for  Public  Financial  Management.  Manila \n\n(TA 7161-TUV, for $857,750, approved on 3 November). \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fEnterprise Act 2010, as well as the establishment of the public enterprise monitoring unit in the \nMinistry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Development  (MFED)  in  2009  to  monitor  and  manage  the \nperformance  of  all  public  enterprises.  However,  it  was  found  that  such  reforms  in  Tuvalu  can \ntake  longer  to  achieve  than  is  initially  expected.  Due  to  the  tight  fiscal  situation  and  a  high \nturnover  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff,  the  government  made  less  progress  than  ADB \nenvisaged  in  follow-on  actions  on  reforms,  such  as  the  operationalization  of  a  debt  risk \nmanagement  and  mitigation  policy  and  the  appointment  of  a  banking  commissioner. 14 The \nnationalization  of  the  electricity  corporation  in  November  2011  was  also  a  setback  to  public \nenterprise reform although the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (Repeal) Act 2011 will not be put \ninto effect. \n \n18. \nThe  overall  design  of  the  program  is  based  on  ADB\u2019s  experiences  with  the  Improved \nFinancial  Management  Program  in  Tuvalu  and  policy-based  lending  programs  in  the  Pacific \nmore  generally.  The  lessons  from  these  activities  emphasize  the  importance  of  promoting \ncountry  ownership  by  ensuring  that  such  programs  (i)  are  realistic,  relatively  simple  in  scope, \nand well within a country\u2019s capacities; (ii) embody a long-term perspective and commitment so \nthat  each  program  is  seen  as  the  next  step  in  a  sequenced  reform  process;  and  (iii)  promote \nstrong development partner collaboration through dialogue and the coordination of missions and \nTA  support. 15 This  design  approach  is  also  consistent  with  advice  received  from  the  IMF,  as \nwell as lessons from ADB\u2019s special evaluation on promoting good governance in the Pacific. 16 \nFor these reasons, the Program will be a single-tranche operation that will require all necessary \npolicy actions are accomplished in advance of grant effectiveness. This will ensure that all the \nPRM reform measures earmarked for implementation in 2012\u2014which are all essential building \nblocks for the reform actions to be supported by Australia, New Zealand, and other development \npartners in 2013 and 2014\u2014are accomplished before effectiveness.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  the  achievement  of  fiscal  sustainability  of  the  Tuvalu  government. \n19. \nThis  is  a  priority  of  the National  Strategy for  Sustainable  Development  and  exemplified  by  the \nreform  measures  in  the  PRM.  The  impact  will  be  measured  against  specific  fiscal  targets  in \nTuvalu\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal  framework  and  verified  by  regular  IMF  staff  missions  and  IMF \nArticle IV consultation reports. The outcome will be improved fiscal management capacity. This \nwill be reflected in improved fiscal management capacity in the event of shocks. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n20. \nThe  program  is  structured  around  PRM  objectives  in the government\u2019s national  plan to \nexercise  sound  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  management,  exert  fiscal  discipline  so  that \ngovernment  budgets  are  fiscally  sustainable,  and  strengthen  and  improve  public  enterprise \nmanagement.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  the  Program  focused  on  the  achievement  of  three \noutputs in 2012. \n \n21. \nfinalization of a PFM reform road map and a procurement policy. \n \n                                                \n14 ADB.  2011.

Manila: ADB. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nThe PFM reform road map allows the government to identify areas of weakness and to \n22. \nchart  a  sequence  of  reform  measures.  It  has  improved  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \ncritical PFM  reforms  strategically  and  cohesively  by  prioritizing  and  sequencing reform  actions \nproperly  and  coordinating  development  partner  support.  The  road  map  was  developed  with \nsupport  from  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  approved  by  the \ngovernment  cabinet  on 27  July  2012. The government  has  already  begun  implementing  some \nelements of the road map: an annual budget calendar has been published; cash reconciliations \nare  now  being  completed  on  a  monthly  basis;  and  public  accounts  have  been  brought  up-to-\ndate, with 2009\u20132011 accounts having been audited. \n \n23. \nThe  procurement  policy  has  clarified  and  strengthened  regulatory  requirements  and \nimproved  incentives  in  the  public  procurement  process  for  competition,  value  for  money,  and \naccountability  through  strengthening  of  tender  and  procurement  procedures.  The  policy  was \ndeveloped  by  the  Attorney  General\u2019s Office  with  support from  ADB  and the  Australian  Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  and  was  approved  by  the  cabinet  on  25  October \n2012. 17 A draft of the procurement policy was provided to ADB for review prior to finalization to \nensure that all necessary fiduciary requirements were met, in accordance with international best \npractice. \n \n24. \nOutput  2:  Improved  fiscal  management  processes.  The  program  supported  the \nidentification and development of fiscal ratios, which are practical management tools to maintain \nfiscal aggregates within agreed bounds. \n \n25. \nThe use of the ratios to set fiscal management targets will complement the principles of \nfiscal  responsibility  contained  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  Public  Finance  Ordinance  1982  and  Financial \nInstructions 1990 and will build on the budget benchmark performance criteria previously used \nby  Australia  and  New  Zealand  as  incentives  for  budget  support.  The  ratios  include  targets  for \ndomestic  revenue,  domestic  expenditure,  personnel  costs,  and  government  borrowing  as \nproportions of GDP. They have been developed with support from ADB and were approved by \nthe  cabinet  on  19  July  2012.  The  ratios  were  used  to  guide  the  preparation  of  the  2013 \nbudget. 18 \n \nOutput  2  is  expected  to  improve  Tuvalu\u2019s  budgetary  position  by  strengthening  the \n26. \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to  track  budget  performance  on  a  quarterly  basis  and  to  measure  this \nperformance against its medium-term fiscal projections. This will allow it to take any corrective \naction necessary in a timely manner. \n \n27. \nOutput  3:  Selected  public  enterprise  rationalization.  The  program  facilitated  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  advance  its  rationalization  plans  for  the  VLH,  the  Tuvalu  Philatelic \nBureau (TPB), the Tuvalu Post Office (TPO), and the Tuvalu Travel Office (TTO). This included \nthe approval of a draft management contract for the hotel and the merging of the TPB, the TPO, \nand the TTO, which are retail businesses. \n \nThe  hotel  has  performed  poorly  in  financial  terms  from  2004  to  2011.  A  scoping  study \n28. \nundertaken with ADB TA in 2011 recommended that the VLH be sold through an international \ntender process. As a transitional arrangement, the government has opted to contract the hotel\u2019s \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 2012.

This  will  allow  it  to  reduce  staff  levels  more  gradually  over  a  longer \nperiod of time than would be the case if the hotel was sold immediately and is considered by the \ngovernment  to  be  necessary  to  mitigate  adverse  political  repercussions  from  the  needed \nretrenchments. The government remains receptive to an outright sale in the medium term. \n \n29. \nADB will help the government publish the invitation to tender for the VLH management \ncontract through local and regional news media. ADB TA (footnote 15) helped to ensure that all \nsupporting documents such as the draft management contract were prepared and approved by \nthe  cabinet. 19 Cabinet  approved  the  draft  management  contract  and  the  advertisement  for \ninvitation to tender on 26 October 2012. \n \n30. \nThe merger of the TPB, the TPO, and the TTO into one entity\u2014called Tuvalu Post and \nTravel\u2014will  help  cut  the  operating  costs  of,  and  subsidies  for,  these  public  enterprises  and \nreduce  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  losses.  All  three  of  the  retail  operations  are  encountering \nincreasingly  stiff  competition,  that  is,  from  newer  technology,  including  email,  telephone  calls \nand travel bookings conducted over the internet. ADB TA (footnote 15) helped the government \nbegin the merger through cabinet approval of the transfer of its shares in TPB and of the assets \nand  liabilities  of  TPO  and  TTO  to  Tuvalu  Post  and  Travel  at  an  agreed  price  and  with  all \nnecessary documentation completed. Cabinet approved the merger on 26 October 2012. \n \n31. \nfree resources that can be used more effectively in other priority budget areas. \n \nD. \n \n32. \n \n33. \nFunds resources to help finance the program.  \n \n34. \nADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $2.35  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, the cost of the government\u2019s reform efforts, and the importance of rebuilding the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal buffer in the CIF. While this is not a cofinancing arrangement, this effort will \nbe part of a joint undertaking with other development partners. Australia has pledged A$500,000 \nand New Zealand NZ$400,000 ($326,623) for the 2012 financial year, while the World Bank has \nindicated that it will consider providing budget support for 2013 and 2014. Projections of budget \nfinancing  requirements  indicate  a  fiscal  deficit  of  5.3%  of  GDP  in  2012,  equivalent  to  A$14.9 \nmillion, without grant support from development partners.  \n \nE. \n\nThe government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.35 million from ADB\u2019s Special \n\nOutput  3  will  contribute  to  fiscal  sustainability.

The implementing \nagencies  will  be  the  MFED\u2019s  public  enterprise  monitoring  unit;  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs, \nEnvironment,  Trade,  Labour  and  Tourism;  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communication. \nEach  will  be  responsible  for  undertaking  the  policy  actions  or  program  activities  under  its \nresponsibilities.  Ongoing  TA  will  help  the  government  fulfill  program  conditions  (footnote  15). \nfor  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nThe  MFED  will  also  be  responsible \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2009.

The  program  will  be  implemented  from  31  March  2012  to  31 \nDecember  2013,  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal  framework.  Policy  and \noperational changes agreed with the government and set out in the policy matrix will be put in \nplace from 31 March 2012 to 29 October 2012. \n \n37. \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants. 20 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. 21  Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof  the  total  imports  of  Tuvalu,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n38. \nTranches.  The  grant  will  be  provided  in  a  single  tranche  and  will  be  disbursed  upon \nsatisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions\u2014that is, fulfillment of all the actions in the program \npolicy matrix. All policy actions have been accomplished. \n \n39. \ngovernment\u2019s  bank  account  with \nsupplementary financing for the 2012 budget. \n \n40. \nProgram  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  MFED  will  establish  a \nperformance  evaluation  system  for  the  program  within  3  months  from  grant  effectiveness  and \nmaintain this. Using this system, the MFED will monitor the program and report to ADB on the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the program \nimpact  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  upon  with  the  government.  Because  the  impact  of  the \nProgram will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, the MFED will continue monitoring \nuntil the beginning of 2014. The information will  be included in the program completion report. \nThis  monitoring  of  the  outcome  and  impact  will  also  be  useful  to  the  government\u2019s  ongoing \nreform processes and PFM decision making. \n  \nProgram  review.  The  government  shall  undertake  periodic  reviews  every  3  months \n41. \nduring  program  implementation  period  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements, \nprogress and achievement of the objectives of the program.

Fiscal  sustainability  will  in  turn  help  restore macroeconomic  stability  in  the \ncountry  and  boost  growth.  Strengthened  PFM  will  also  improve  service  delivery,  which  is \nessential  to  making  the  growth  process  inclusive  and  to  fostering  employment  and  poverty \nreduction. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n43. \nImproving the government\u2019s spending allocation decisions and reducing the demand on \nthe budget made by public enterprises will create fiscal space and allow the government to shift \nexpenditures to priority areas. Tuvalu\u2019s overall fiscal performance will thereby improve. Budget \nrestraint  and  strengthened  fiscal  management  will  allow  the  government to  rebuild  its  external \nrevenue  cushion  and  reduce  its  vulnerability  to  fiscal  shocks.  The  program\u2019s  long-term  impact \nwill  be  greater  government  capacity  for  fiscal  management,  which  will  help  bring  the  budget \ndeficit below the target of 10% of GDP. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nin \n\nThe  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \n44. \nprogram.  The  2011  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  for  Tuvalu \n(footnote  11)  identified  the  areas  of  weaknesses  in  government  budgeting  processes.  The \nsubsequent implementation of the PFM reform roadmap\u2014and, more broadly, the emphasis on \nthe  government\u2019s \nfinancial  management \nimproving  public \ncommitment to managing the budget credibly and effectively. 22 \n \n45. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  the  MFEM.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant agreement. \n  \nC. \n\nthe  PRM\u2014demonstrates \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nImproved PFM  will have positive impacts on the delivery of social services. In the near \n46. \nterm, rationalization of the state enterprises could lead to modest job losses. A clear transition \nschedule  for  redundancy  will  be  accompanied  by  retraining  or  compensation  to  avert  adverse \nsocial impacts and will be supported by ADB and other development partners. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n47. \nProgram  activities  will  be  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms  and  none  of  the \nactivities  will  result  in,  or  lead  to,  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  people. \nSafeguard categories for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all \nC. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Public consultation has been carried \nout during the processing of the program and fact finding. \n\n                                                \n22  Further  assessment  is  available  in  the  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n48. \n \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe program faces three key risks:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  narrow  economic  base  leaves  the  country  vulnerable  to  shocks.  Should \nthese  occur,  the  reform  focus  would  likely  switch  from  strengthening  public \nfinancial management to short-term stabilization. \nThe political consensus needed to mount program reforms could prove difficult to \nmaintain, particularly for public enterprise reforms.  \n\n(iii)  Capacity  constraints  and  staff  turnover  could  limit  the  government\u2019s  ability  to \n\nmanage the program. \n\n \nThe program design mitigates these risks. The rebuilding of fiscal reserves will help the \n49. \ngovernment weather potential external shocks. Political consensus has been reinforced through \nthe  government\u2019s  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  PRM  process  and  the  subsequent  reform \neffort. In addition, MFED with support from ADB TA (footnote 15) have conducted a concerted \noutreach  program  to  build  wider  support  for  reform  among  parliamentarians  and  in  the \ncommunity. Capacity constraints will be offset in part through new and ongoing TA provided by \nADB and other partners. To mitigate the risk of overburdening institutions, the PRM presents a \ncontinuance of reforms that have been under preparation since 2009. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 23 \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and the MFED have assured ADB that implementation of the program \n50. \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the grant document. \n \n51. \nThe  government  and  the  MFED  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB \nis satisfied that all conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the grant agreement, have been complied \nwith.  \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n52. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard  approve  the  grant  not  exceeding  $2,350,000  to  Tuvalu  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources for the Strengthened Public Financial Management Program, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented \nto the Board. \n\n \n\nBindu N.
