An additional 110 kilometers (km) of national roads and 120 km of provincial roads \nin  the  Northern  Province  and  the  North  Central  Province  (NCP)  will  be  rehabilitated.3 It  will \nfacilitate economic growth and contribute to reducing disparities in Sri Lanka, in line with one of \nthe Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s key goals, which emphasizes equitable growth. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nAs Sri Lanka continues to absorb the benefits of the end of its 3-decade civil conflict in \n3. \nMay  2009,  the  economy  grew  at  a  high  rate  of  8.3%  in  2011.  Among  others,  the  Northern \nProvince  and  its  neighboring  NCP  are  in  the  worst  conflict-affected  region  in  the  country.  With \nthe  normalization  of  the  economic  and  social  environment,  economic  prospects  in  the  two \nprovinces demonstrate significant improvement. In 2010, the highest rate of growth (22.9%) was \nrecorded  in  the  Northern  Province,  and  a  similar  rate  (20.3%)  in  the  NCP.  However,  regional \ndisparity remains a feature of the economy. The share of gross domestic product is only 3.4% \nfor the Northern Province and 4.8% for NCP\u2014less than their share of the population. \n \n4. \nRecognizing this, the government\u2019s development strategy emphasizes equitable access \nto  infrastructure  and  services  for  all,  to  promote  inclusive  growth.4 The  sustainability  of  recent \ndevelopment outcomes is at risk if the road connectivity cannot be improved in a timely manner. \nProlonged underinvestment during the conflict left the road network in a state of total disrepair. \nPeople  in  the  region  have  poor  and  limited  access  to  local  markets  and  basic  social  services. \nMobility  between  the  Northern  Province  and  southern  regions  requires  substantial  travel  time \nowing to the inadequate condition of the linking arterial roads. Poor road connectivity in Northern \nProvince and NCP has hindered the spread of economic activities and regional development. \n \n5. \nIn  support  of  the  government\u2019s  national  strategy,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved  loans  on  18  June  2010  for  the  Northern  Road  Connectivity  Project  (footnote  2).  The \noriginal project is rehabilitating about 170 km of national roads and 140 km of provincial roads in \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  TA  was  provided  in  conjunction  with  the  original  project.

During  appraisal,  the  total  project  cost  was  estimated  at \n$173 million. ADB finances the original project through (i) a loan of $130 million from its ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR);  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  SDR16,080,000  ($24.4  million  equivalent)  from  its \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  government  finances  $18.6  million  of  taxes  and  duties.  The \noriginal project is performing well based on the following assessment:5  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation  progress \n\nimplementation  progress.  The \n\nDelivery  of  expected  outputs. The delivery of expected outputs is satisfactory. \nThe construction works on national roads, provincial roads, and the offices of the \nNPRDD  will  be  completed  by  March  2013,  and  will  be  followed  with  3-year \nperformance-based maintenance of project roads. The original project is on track \nto meet the intended outcome of improved road connectivity within the Northern \nProvince and with the southern region of the country. \nSatisfactory \nis \nsatisfactory. As of June 2012, all contracts have been awarded with a cumulative \namount  of  $108.15  million  (104.5%  of \nthe  projection).  The  cumulative \ndisbursement has reached $36.26 million (111.2% of the projection). \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy \nrequirements.  The \ncompliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  the  original  project  is \nproceeding satisfactorily. \nSuccessful management of risks. The risks have been successfully managed. \nThe main lesson is that high implementation readiness will avoid delays for such \na  project  in  the  post-conflict  area.  To  address  the  risk  of  post-project  operation \nand  maintenance,  provisions  of  3-year  performance-based  maintenance  are \nincluded in all contracts. A road maintenance scheme is being established in the \nNorthern Province.6 \nOn  track  rating.  The  original  project  has  been  rated  on  track  in  the  project \nperformance rating for the last 12 months. \n\n \n6. \nIt  is  estimated  that  $20  million  of  proceeds  of  the  original  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  will \nbecome  surplus.  To  cover  additional  geographical  areas  and  consolidate  the  development \noutcomes, the government has requested ADB to scale up the original project with the surplus \nand  additional  financing.  The  overall  project  meets  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing,7 \nwhich will help consolidate development outcomes by covering additional geographic areas and \nincreasing  project  beneficiaries.  The  modality  of  additional  financing  will  enhance  the  intended \nimpact  of  the  original  project  by  utilizing  the  existing  implementation  arrangements  to  achieve \nresults expeditiously. \n \nThe  overall  project,  including  the  original  project  and  the  additional  financing,  is  in  line \n7. \nwith  the  strategic  objective  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  as  agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB:  improving  connectivity  and  service  delivery  to  lagging \nregions,  including  the  former  conflict-affected  regions  of  the  country.8 The  proposed  additional \nfinancing is included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014.9 In the future, ADB\u2019s \nassistance  will  focus  on  (i)  continuing  to  improve  the  road  connectivity  for  the  lagging  regions \nand  for  important  links,  (ii)  relieving  the  traffic  congestion  in  the  urban  areas  and  on  the  trunk \n\n                                                 \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The government agreed to establish a mechanism in Northern Province to use at least 50% of the revenue from the \nvehicle license fees towards routine maintenance in the loan agreements. Such a mechanism will require approval \nof  the  elected  Northern  Provincial  Council.  Since  the  election  has  not  been  held,  as  an  interim  arrangement,  the \nNorthern Provincial Council finances the road maintenance through a provision of its annual budget. \n7   ADB. 2011.

The TA will be expanded to \nenhance  the  capacity  of  road  agencies  in  road  operation  and  maintenance  by  continuing  the \nefforts of the original TA and previous TA in NCP.15 The TA will carry out the following additional \nactivities: (i) building the capacity of NPRDD and NCPRDA in administering performance-based \nmaintenance  contracts  with  the  road  asset  management  system  developed  in  previous  TA; \n(ii) improving the awareness of the Road Development Authority (RDA), NPRDD, and NCPRDA \non how to design and implement gender-inclusive road projects; and (iii) raising the awareness \nof road users through training on road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking. \n \nThe cost of additional TA activities is estimated at $1 million, which will be financed by \n18. \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide office space \nand counterpart staff from RDA, NPRDD, and NCPRDA. The TA will provide required consultant \ninput and necessary equipment and facilities. A consulting firm will be recruited to implement the \nTA.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  needed  to  facilitate  the  TA  implementation.  The \nconsultant  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time).

The  construction  method  will  utilize  proven  technology  with \nstandard  materials  compatible  with  local  conditions.  All  civil  works  contracts  will  include \nrehabilitation  of  project  roads  and  5-year  performance-based  maintenance.  The  project  roads \nhave  been  assessed  for  climate  vulnerability  according  to  the  National  Climate  Change \nAdaptation  Strategy  for  Sri  Lanka.18 Key  risks  assessed  include  (i)  shifting  of  climate  zones, \n(ii) flood  risk,  (iii)  landslides,  (iv)  sea  level  rise,  and  (v)  drought  exposure.  The  design  of  the \nproject roads includes provisions for embankment rising and drainage enhancement. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \n20. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 19  The  principal  benefits  calculated  are  savings  in  vehicle \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                 \n15 Capacity  Development  of  Provincial  Road  Agencies  (TA  7347-SRI),  attached  to  ADB.  2009.

Manila. \n\n\fGovernance \n\noperating costs and travel time.20 The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range \nfrom  17.3%  to  24.1%  for  additional  national  roads  (footnote  17).  The  overall  EIRR  for  the \nnational  roads  is  21.2%.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  overall  national  road \nimprovement  has  an  EIRR  above  12%.  The  EIRRs  for  additional  provincial  roads  range  from \n12.1% to 36.3%. The overall EIRR for the provincial roads is 22.4%. The sensitivity analysis of \nthe overall provincial roads resulted in an EIRR above 12%. Individually, a few provincial road \nsections  may  have  an  EIRR  below  12%  if  there  is  an  adverse  variation  in  costs  and  benefits. \nHowever, the inclusion of these provincial road sections is considered appropriate because they \nprovide essential accessibility to the rural and poor population in the interior areas. \n \n21. \nThe EIRRs of the national and provincial roads covered by the original project, additional \nscope,  and  both  combined  are  above  12%.  Therefore,  the  proposed  improvements  are \neconomically  viable.  In  addition  to  the  quantified  benefits,  the  project  will  bring  significant \nbenefits to the overall regional development. The project road will provide direct access to social \nservices, such as education and health facilities. The industry development will also benefit from \nthe improved national roads as the investment climate is upgraded by better connectivity to the \nsupply sources and markets outside the region. While such benefits are not quantified, they are \nthe project's contribution to economic development and poverty reduction. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nPolicy  and  legal.  RDA,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  national  road  component,  is \nresponsible  for  the  development  and  maintenance  of  the  national  highway  network.  RDA  was \nestablished as a statutory authority with a separate legal personality by the Road Development \nAuthority  Act  in  1981.  RDA\u2019s  chairperson  reports  to  the  secretary  of  the  Ministry  of  Ports  and \nHighways (MOPH). \n \n23. \nNPRDD,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  provincial  road  component  in  the  Northern \nProvince, is responsible for the Northern Province\u2019s provincial road network in accordance with \nthe 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The director of NPRDD reports to Northern Province's \nchief secretary through the secretary of the provincial Ministry of Infrastructure Development and \nReconstruction. The Northern Province does not have an elected council. The chief secretary of \nthe  Northern  Province,  who  has  wide  provincial  administrative  authority,  will  chair  the  project \ncoordinating committee for monitoring provincial project implementation. \n \n24. \nNCPRDA,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  provincial  road  component  in  NCP,  is \nresponsible for managing provincial roads in NCP. It is established through a provincial statute \nas a separate legal entity operating within NCP. NCPRDA is headed by a board of directors, one \nof whom is appointed as the chairperson. \n \nInstitutional  capacity.  RDA  and  NCPRDA  have  sufficient  capacity,  past  experience, \n25. \nand  institutional  strength  to  implement  the  project.  NPRDD's  capacity  has  been  strengthened \nthrough implementing the provincial road component of the current project, and enhanced by the \nTA for capacity development of NPRDD. \n \n26. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  carried  out  for  the \nimplementing  agencies\u2014RDA,  NPRDD,  and  NCPRDA.  All  implementing  agencies  have  prior \nand ongoing experience of implementing ADB-funded projects and have satisfactory capacity in \nterms of project financial accounting and knowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. RDA and \nNPRDD  have,  and  NCPRDA  will  soon  establish  a  dedicated  project  accounting  and  finance \n                                                 \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nteam  with  suitably  qualified  accountants.  RDA,  NPRDD,  and  NCPRDA  will  establish  and \nmaintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources received and \nexpenditures  made  for  the  project, ensuring  an  adequate  audit  trail.  The  government\u2019s  Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related financial statements in \naccordance with international auditing standards. \n \n27. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nthe relevant ADB guidelines. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time), \nthe  Declaration  of  Asset  and  Liabilities  Act,  No.  1  of  1975,  and  Permanent  Commission  to \nInvestigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No 19 of 1994 provide a legal basis to deal \nwith bribery and corruption. The auditor general also monitors procurement of the agencies, with \nspecial attention to procedural propriety in procurement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended from time to time) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOPH, the \nMinistry of Local Government and Provincial Councils (MLGPC), RDA, NPRDD, and NCPRDA. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n \n28. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact. A poverty and social assessment of the project \narea found the project would provide communities with enhanced mobility and improved social \ninteractions. The project will have a short-term impact on poverty reduction by employing local \npopulation.  These  opportunities  will  increase  livelihood  opportunities  for  those  depending  on \noccasional  employment.  Furthermore,  the  project  will  prove  access  to  new  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities.  Improved  roads  will  help  the  rural  population  to  transport  their \nproducts  to  markets  and  obtain  higher  profit  margins.  It  is  estimated  that  1.86  million  people \nresiding  in  five  districts  will  benefit  from  the  project.  The  contracts  for  civil  works  will  include \nmeasures to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for both men and women labors. \nThe  contractors  are  required  to  comply  with  equal  pay  for  equal  work  for  men  and  women, \nhealth  and  safety  at  construction  sites  and  labor  camps,  no  child  labor,  and  an  awareness \nprogram for workers on the prevention of sexually transmitted infections.21 \n \n29. \nGender.  Sri  Lanka  ranks  midway  on  the  United  Nations  gender-related  development \nindex.  However,  in  general,  gender-related  indicators  in  the  northern  and  eastern  parts  of  the \ncountry  lag  behind  national  levels.  Women  in  project  areas  are  frequent  road  users  for  family \ntasks. Improved road connectivity will provide better access to health services, higher levels of \neducation,  economic  opportunities,  and  social  interactions.  Reduced  travel  time  will  result  in \nmore  time  on  productive  activities.  No  adverse  impact  on  women  was  envisaged.  A  gender \naction  plan  has  been  prepared  for  the  project  to  (i)  maximize  women\u2019s  access  to  project \nbenefits,  (ii)  provide  opportunities  to  increase  women\u2019s  skills  and  income,  and  (iii)  minimize \nsocial  vulnerability.  Practical  and  implementable  activities  have  been  incorporated. 22  Key \nactivities  include  (i)  involving  women  in  civil  works,  (ii)  ensuring  road  safety  awareness  in \nroadside  communities,  (iii)  providing  a  pedestrian-  and  cyclist-friendly  design,  and  (iv)  building \nthe  capacity  of  government  agencies  in  improving  gender-sensitivity  of  transport  projects.  A \ngender  specialist  will  be  engaged  under  the  associated  TA  to  support  RDA,  NCPRDA,  and \nNPRDD in the overall implementation of the gender action plan. \n \n30. \nHIV/AIDS.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  low  HIV  prevalence  rate  although  the  number  of  reported \ncases  has  increased,  in  part  because  of  improved  access  to  testing  facilities.  Countrywide \n\n                                                 \n21 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous \n\nresponses  have  included  the  establishment  of  the  National  STD/AIDS  Control  Programme, \nwhich  helps  to  refurbish  health  clinic  and  establish  outreach  and  awareness  programs.  The \nproject  has  incorporated  measures  to  mitigate  HIV/AIDS  risks,  by  undertaking  awareness \nprograms for civil works contractors at construction sites, and for project-affected communities at \nprominent  village  locations.  Awareness-raising  activities  for  project-affected  persons  will  be \nconducted separately for men and women to address gender-specific issues. \n \n31. \nHuman  trafficking.  Human  trafficking  is  not  a  significant  issue  in  the  project  area. \nCommunities  with  young  widows  and  orphaned  children  have  been  identified  as  potential  risk \ngroups. Awareness programs for human trafficking will be held in project-affected communities. \n \nE. \n \n32. \nInvoluntary resettlement. The project is classified category B. Road improvements are \nwithin  the  existing  right-of-way  (footnote  17).  Limited  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be \nrequired on one national highway (AB019). It is estimated that 37 households (151 persons) will \nbe affected. The majority of these households will experience a limited impact, including loss of \nboundary walls, crops, and home gardens. One household, consisting of four persons, will lose \nmore  than  10%  of  its  productive  assets.  One  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s Land \nAcquisition Act of 1950, and the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy introduced in 2001.23 \nThe Environmental and Social Division of RDA will implement the resettlement plan. \n \n33. \npeoples and is classified category C. \n \nEnvironment. The project is classified category B. None of the project roads are located \n34. \ninside  protected  areas  or  environmentally  sensitive  areas  (footnote  17).  Three \ninitial \nenvironmental  examination  reports  together  with  environmental  monitoring  plans  (EMPs)  have \nbeen  prepared  for  the  national  roads,  northern  provincial  roads,  and  north  central  provincial \nroads.  Contract  package-specific  EMPs  have  also  been  prepared.  The  requirements  of  the \nEMPs  and  of  the  conditional  clearance  provided  by  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  have \nbeen included in the bidding documents and as part of the contracts. Anticipated environmental \nimpacts  include  small-scale  removal  of  trees;  occupational  health  and  safety  issues;  and \ngeneration of dust, noise, and drainage problems. These are mainly confined to the construction \nstage  and  can  be  addressed  through  mitigation  measures.  Details  of  consultations,  feedback \nreceived,  requirements  for  further  consultation,  and  the  grievance  redress  mechanism  have \nbeen included in the initial environmental examination report.24  \n \n35. \nThe  Environmental  and  Social  Division  of  RDA,  assisted  by  the  project  implementation \nconsultants,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  for  the  national  roads.  The  project \nimplementation  units  of \nthe \nimplementation of the social and environment safeguards for provincial roads, with support from \nthe  project  implementation  consultants.  Training  and  coordination  workshops  on  environment \nsafeguards  and  EMP  implementation  will  be  conducted  for  implementing  agencies  and \ncontractors,  as  necessary.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  prepared  annually  and \nsubmitted  to  ADB  for  disclosure  on  the  ADB  website,  as  required  by  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement for environment category B projects. \n\nthe  NPRDD  and  NCPRDA  will  coordinate  and  monitor \n\n                                                 \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n36. \nThe  key  risk  is  implementation  delay.  To  mitigate  the  risk,  detail  design  and  bidding \ndocuments  have  been  prepared  in  advance  to  award  the  first  contract  shortly  upon  loan \neffectiveness. The overall risk assessment is medium without mitigation and low with mitigation. \nIntegrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  costs.
