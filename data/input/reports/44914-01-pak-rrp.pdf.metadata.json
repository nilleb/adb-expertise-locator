The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n2. \nAs in most developing countries, energy deficits have been one of the major constraints \nand  bottlenecks  for  efficient  economic  growth  in  Pakistan.  To  ensure  a  sustainable  supply  of \nenergy,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  launched  an  initiative  for  promotion  of  private  sector \nparticipation in the country\u2019s infrastructure, including the power sector. As a part of these efforts, \nthe  Power  Policy  1994  and  the  Hydel  Policy  1995  were  introduced,  both  of  which  were \nconsolidated in the Power Policy 2002. \n \n3. \nThe  project  is  one  of  the  long-gestated  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  projects \nwhose  site  has  been  investigated  extensively  in  the  past.  It  was  envisaged  as  one  of  the  first \nseven  prospective  IPPs  advertised  by  the  Private  Power  Infrastructure  Board  (PPIB)  in  April \n2005 for private sector investment. \n \n4. \nIn October 2005, based on the technical and financial criteria, the PPIB issued a letter of \ninterest to the Emirates Trading Agency and TransAsia Gas International, both subsidiaries of \nthe Al-Ghurair Group from the United Arab Emirates, requesting them to undertake a feasibility \nstudy  of  the  project.  Subsequently,  SHPL  was  incorporated  by  the  Emirates  Trading  Agency \nand  TransAsia  Gas  International  in  April  2006,  and  the  PPIB  approved  the  project\u2019s  feasibility \nstudy in July 2007. \n \n5. \nGiven  the  experience  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  advising  and  financing \nPakistan\u2019s first hydro IPP, the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project,1 the relatively large size \nof  the  project\u2019s  debt  financing  requirement,  and  the  fact  that  the  private  banking  market  has \nbeen hesitant in providing limited recourse financing to projects in Pakistan, SHPL approached \nADB in early 2008 for financing of the project. \n \nIn 2009, the consortium of the Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water), Daewoo \n6. \nEngineering  and  Construction  Company  Limited  (Daewoo  E&C),  and  Sambu  Construction \nCompany Limited (Sambu) acquired SHPL fully through their special purpose vehicle, the KDS \nHydro Private Limited (KDS). On 27 August 2009, the PPIB issued a no-objection letter to the \nproposed change of SHPL\u2019s ownership. \n \nB. \n\nSector Background \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply Gap of Electricity \n\n7. \nAddition  of  power  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  a  matter  of  utmost  urgency. \nPakistan\u2019s power industry faces a major supply deficit that is constraining the country\u2019s already \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  Laraib \n\nEnergy Limited for the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project in Pakistan. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nfragile economic growth. As compared with 18,926 megawatts (MW) peak demand in mid-2010, \nthe country had only 14,723 MW firm supply, resulting in a shortfall of 4,203 MW (or 22.2% of \nthe  country\u2019s  peak  electricity  demand). 2  As  of  June  2010,  the  country\u2019s  installed  power \ngeneration  capacity  was  20,375  MW,  of  which  about  55%  was  owned  and  operated  by \ngovernment  entities  and  45%  by  IPPs  and/or  majority  private  operators.  Appendix  3  provides \nmore details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector. \n \n8. \nAlthough  electricity  sales  and  demand  have  risen  by  more  than  40%  from  FY2004  to \nFY2009,  investment  in  new  generation  capacity  has  lagged  behind  expectation.  The  resultant \npower  shortage  has  led  to  ever-increasing  incidents  of  brownouts  and  blackouts  in  all  major \nurban centers. Measures to ration consumption are already being taken. The blackouts in rural \nareas are worse where some areas suffered 22 hours without electricity last summer. Even with \nthe  economic  slowdown  and  dislocations  caused  by  the  flooding  in  2010,  power  demand  is \nexpected to continue to increase, and latent demand is considered substantial. Left unattended, \nthe  country\u2019s  power  deficit  will  continue  to  worsen  and  will  impact  Pakistan\u2019s  economy  even \nmore adversely.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPrimary Energy and Fuel Mix  \n\n9. \nPakistan urgently needs to develop indigenous energy resources. The power industry in \nPakistan is a mix of thermal, hydro, and nuclear power plants. Thermal power plants, which use \nimported fuel oil to meet almost 52% of their fuel needs (the balance is based on gas), account \nfor 67.6% of installed capacity; hydro plants account for 30.3%, and nuclear plants provide the \nremaining 2%. Coal-fired thermal plants account for only 0.1%. Originally, the ratio of hydro to \nthermal  installed  generation  capacity  in  the  country  was  about  2:1  (in  1985).  Over  time,  more \nthermal generation capacity was installed, leaving the country heavily dependent on imported oil \nfor its primary fuel requirements. Rising oil imports have caused the country\u2019s current account \ndeficit  to  increase.  They  have  also  caused  considerable  price  escalation  and  volatility.  High \nelectricity tariffs are eroding the viability and affordability of the sector. \n  \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Position \n\nThe  \u201ccircular  debt  problem\u201d  impedes  the  progress  of  power  generation  expansion  and \n10. \nsours the mood of existing and potential investors in Pakistan\u2019s power industry. Circular debt is \ncaused  by  nonpayment  of  subsidies  by  the  Government  of  Pakistan  to  cover  a  shortfall  that \nresults from their notifying tariff charged to customers below the cost levels determined by the \nregulator. Distribution companies are not able to charge the full cost-recovery tariff determined \nby  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA).  The  government  has  insulated \npower consumers by providing subsidies to distribution companies, but there have been delays \nin government payments. This has resulted in revenue shortfalls for distribution companies and \ntemporary  deferment  of  payments  to  nearly  all  power  plants  in  the  system.  Power  generation \ncompanies  have  seen  their  receivables  rise,  and  generation  companies  have  been  forced  to \nstop,  delay,  or  reduce  payments  to  their  fuel  suppliers  to  balance  their  cash  flows.  This  has \ncaused delays in fuel supply to power generators and negatively impacted generation capacity. \nThis  issue  is  not  new  and  has  been  partially  mitigated  in  the  past.  However,  it  is  once  again \nbecoming  a  growing  problem  that  must  be  resolved  if  the  potential  of  the  private  sector  to \naddress Pakistan\u2019s power deficit is to be unleashed. Measures are under way, but challenges \nremain. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Private Power and Infrastructure Board. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/SupplyDemand.html \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n4. \n\nResponse by the Government of Pakistan \n\n11. \nTo address the energy shortage and growing power crisis, the government has decided \nto implement several energy expansion initiatives, with an emphasis on developing indigenous \nresources. These initiatives include expanding thermal and hydropower generation capacity by \nIPPs  under  the  government\u2019s  Power  Policy  2002,  procuring  power  from  rental  power  plants \nunder  short-term  agreements,  securing  electricity  and  gas  imports  from  regional  projects,  and \ntapping into the huge potential of renewable energy sources. The government is also exploring \nthe  possibility  of  using  its  domestic  coal  reserves,  which  are  among  the  largest  in  the  world \n(albeit  low  quality  and  remotely  located).  However,  the  time  horizon  for  domestic  coal-fired \npower  generation  is  relatively  long  term.  In  the  short  to  medium  term,  both  conventional  (i.e., \nthermal)  and  renewable  energy\u2014predominantly  hydro  and  wind\u2014are  expected  to  be  the \nmainstays  of  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  supply.  Simultaneously,  improving  transmission  and \ndistribution  efficiency  is  a  key  area  of  focus,  and  ADB  has  been  assisting  the  government\u2019s \nprogram through its public sector operations.3 \n \nThe  government  has  started  efforts  to  resolve  the  circular  debt  problem  by  increasing \n12. \nconsumer  tariffs  and  by  transferring  the  debt  in  the  system  to  a  newly  established  company \noutside of the energy sector. ADB continues to support the government\u2019s sector reform program \nunder the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.4 \n \n13. \nThe  reform  and  restructuring  of  the  sector  has  been  supported  by  major  development \npartners  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  but  progress  has  been  slow  and  protracted  and \nmany  areas  have  lagged  behind  expectations. 5 The  appointment  of  independent  boards  of \ndirectors is critical for autonomy and commercial discipline, and recently the new boards of eight \ndistribution  companies  were  appointed.  An  important  measure  required  to  move  toward  full \ncommercialization  of  the  power  industry  is  to  make  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Authority \neffective  as  an  autonomous  body  to  ensure  financial  transparency  and  accountability. \nInsufficient reform of end-consumer tariffs, delinquent customer accounts, and other institutional \nfactors are major hurdles to reforming and improving the poor financial health of the sector. \n \n\n5. \n\nPrivate Sector Investment in Pakistan \n\n14. \nPakistan has undertaken wide-ranging reforms in the energy sector with the assistance \nof ADB and the World Bank. In the early 1990s, the government, recognizing that the required \ninvestment  in  the  sector  could  not  be  provided  by  the  public  sector  alone,  restructured  and \nopened  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  to  private  investment.  Since  then,  Pakistan  has  had  a  long \nhistory  of  private  sector  involvement  in  the  energy  sector,  and  IPPs  provide  about  a  third  of \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2006.

Under the Power Policy 2002, 11 IPPs representing almost 2,200 MW of installed \ncapacity have been commissioned or under construction. \n \n15. \nADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to attract private capital \ninto  the  energy  sector  and  has  been  instrumental  in  many  pioneering  transactions.  ADB \nfinanced  the  first  private  hydropower  project,  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project \n(footnote 1). This transaction set the precedent for many follow-on private hydropower projects \nin Pakistan including this project. ADB has also provided equity and a partial credit guarantee \nfor a gas-fired combined cycle power project, the Daharki Power Project, using indigenous gas.6 \nTo  encourage  investment  in  the  energy  sector,  the  government  has  taken  steps  to  privatize \nstate-owned power companies\u2014both generation plants and distribution networks. ADB helped \nthe government privatize the Karachi Electric Supply Company, and provided a loan in 2007 for \nthe  privatized  entity  to  expand  its  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  infrastructure.7 In \n2010,  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  approved  a  loan  to  support  the  Zorlu  Enerji  Power  Project, \nwhich  is  the  first  wind  power  project  to  be  undertaken  by  the  private  sector;8 and  a  loan  and \npolitical  risk  guarantee  to  support  the  Uch-II  Power  Project,9 which  uses  a  gas-fired  combined \ncycle technology and indigenous gas.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n16. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020,  which  emphasizes  investment  in \ninfrastructure to achieve high sustainable economic progress, connect the poor to markets, and \nincrease  their  access  to  basic  productive  assets,  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  achieving \ninclusive  growth.10 Strategy  2020  puts  particular  emphasis  on  expanding  energy  supplies  and \npromoting  energy  efficiency  through  supply-side  measures.  Strategy  2020  also  emphasizes, \namong five drivers of change: (i) private sector development and private sector operations, and \n(ii)  partnerships.  The  proposed  assistance  will  promote  a  larger  role  for  the  private  sector  in \ndeveloping  infrastructure  through  partnerships  with  multilateral  development  banks  and  a \nbilateral financing agency. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\n17. \nADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2009\u20132013,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  energy  sector  development,  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in \nthe  energy  sector.11 The  project  is  a  logical  continuation  of  ADB\u2019s  development  and  reform \nefforts  in  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector,  which  have  been  designed  to  promote  a  well-regulated, \nmarket-oriented power industry. Energy infrastructure has featured prominently in ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations in Pakistan. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Energy Sector Strategy \n\n18. \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe  three  pillars  of  that  policy\u2014maximizing  access  to  energy  for  all.12 Access  to  modern  and \nreliable  energy  services  fosters  sustainable  human  development,  economic  growth,  a  higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand increase the reliability of electricity supplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. It \nwill  promote  the  use  of  indigenous  water  resources.  Electricity  supplied  by  the  project  will  be \nmore  affordable  than  existing  supplies,  and  will  not  be  affected  by  the  volatility  of  the \ninternational  fuel  market.  By  promoting  the  use  of  indigenous  resources,  the  project  will  also \ncontribute  to  the  country\u2019s  energy  security.  The  project  will  be  more  environmentally  friendly \nthan conventional power plants that use fossil fuels, and will help ADB to meet its commitment \nto undertake clean energy investments of $1 billion per year. It is also expected that the project \nwill benefit from ADB\u2019s carbon market initiative for delivery of certified emission reductions. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nThe Borrower/Sponsor \n\n19. \nSHPL  is  a  special  purpose  vehicle  created  to  implement  the  project  and  will  be  the \nborrower. SHPL was incorporated in Pakistan under the Companies Ordinance 1984. SHPL will \nbe  indirectly,  wholly  owned  by  K-water,  Daewoo  E&C  and  Sambu  through  KDS\u2014a  special \npurpose vehicle for the shareholders, registered in Singapore.  \n \n20. \nK-water, the main sponsor of the project, is a water management and energy company \nwholly  owned  by  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea.  K-water\u2019s  capabilities  range  from \nresearch  and  development,  through  all  aspects  of  engineering  and  design  of  water-related \ninfrastructure,  to  operation  and  management  of  water  supply  services  and  renewable  energy \ngeneration.  Since  its  inception  in  1967,  K-water  has  been  engaged  in  development  of  water \nresources  and  water-related  infrastructure  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  It  has  managed  water \nresources  for  over  40  years,  providing  a  stable  source  of  water  supply  to  populations  in  the \nRepublic of Korea and operating multipurpose dams, which help prevent natural disasters such \nas  floods  and  droughts.  K-water  has  constructed  and  operated  26  hydroelectric  power \ngeneration  facilities,  including  15  multipurpose  dams.  Current  activities  of  K-water  include \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  15  multipurpose  dams  with  an  aggregate  installed \ncapacity  of  1,017  MW,  which  is  about  63.2%  of  the  total  installed  hydropower  capacity  in  the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  K-water  is  undertaking  construction  of  three  multipurpose  dams  and  the \nworld\u2019s largest tidal power plant (254 MW) in the Republic of Korea. K-water is constructing and \nmanaging a multiregional water supply system and an industrial water supply system. K-water \nhad water supply capacity of 17.2 million cubic meters (m3) per day as of 31 December 2008, \nwhich  accounted  for  44.5%  of  the  daily  water  supply  capacity  in  the  Republic  of  Korea.  In \naddition, the Government of the Republic of Korea is implementing the Four River Restoration \nProject to increase water supply capacity by 1.3 billion m3 and increase flood control capacity by \n920  million  m3.  K-water  is  involved  in  the  Four  River  Restoration  Project\u2014constructing, \nmanaging,  and  developing  dams,  reservoirs,  and  their  surrounding  areas,  with  an  expected \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\ninvestment of about $7 billion from 2009 to 2012. K-water is an active partner in ADB\u2019s Water \nfor All initiative. \n \n21. \nDaewoo E&C and Sambu have strong track records in Pakistan. Daewoo E&C, founded \nin 1973, is an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor; and has extensive \nexperience  in  engineering  and  construction  of  housing,  dams,  power  plants,  industrial  plants, \nand liquefied natural gas facilities around the world. Daewoo E&C built the Lahore\u2013Islamabad \nmotorway  in  Pakistan.  Sambu  is  also  one  of  the  leading  EPC  contractors  in  the  Republic  of \nKorea and was founded in 1948. Sambu is the first EPC license holder in the Republic of Korea \nwith varied and extensive experience in building dams and hydroelectric power plants, ports and \nharbors,  bridges,  tunnels,  and  railroads  in  different  Asian  countries.  Sambu  is  also  the  EPC \ncontractor  for  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project  (footnote  1),  the  first  hydro  IPP  in \nPakistan. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\nThe  project  involves  construction  and  operation  of  a  147  MW  run-of-river  hydroelectric \n22. \npower generation facility between the Kunhar and Jhelum Rivers near Muzaffarabad, on a build-\nown-operate-transfer basis. The concession period is 30 years from the commercial operations \ndate. The physical layout of the project extends from the location of the weir near Patrind village \non the Kunhar River, through a 2.2 kilometers (km) headrace tunnel to the location of the power \nhouse  on  the  Jhelum  River  at  Lower  Chattar  in  Muzaffarabad.  The  total  catchment  area \nmeasured at the weir site is 2,429 square kilometers. \n \nThe key components of the project include the weir, head pond, power intake, sand trap \n23. \nbasin, headrace tunnel, and power house. The weir on the Kunhar River will divert flows from \nthe Kunhar River to the Jhelum River through a system of power intake, sand trap, power shaft, \nand headrace tunnel. The project envisages the use of about net head of 108.1 meters between \nthe  water  intake  on  the  Kunhar  River  and  the  power  house,  accommodating  three  vertical \nFrancis  units,  each  of  50 MW  capacity,  to  be  built  on  the  Jhelum  River.  The  annual  energy \ngeneration  of  the  power  plant,  based  on  average  historical  hydrology,  will  be  632.6  gigawatt-\nhours,  and  the  electricity  will  be  fed  into  the  network  through  a  132 kilovolt  (kV)  double-circuit \ntransmission line, to be constructed by the power purchaser. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Outputs and Outcome \n\nThe  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  generation  of  additional  electricity  supply  of \n24. \n632.6 gigawatt-hours  per  year  at  lower  cost.  The  project  will  generate  electricity  by  using \nindigenous water resources, and the tariff for electricity supplied by the project will be lower than \nthat  for  plants  that  use  imported  fuel.  The  project  will  also  save  greenhouse  gas  emission  of \n280,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. \n \n25. \nThe  outputs  of  the  project  are  net  additional  installed  capacity  of  147  MW,  which  is \nequivalent to 3.5% of the current energy shortfall in the country. In addition, during construction, \nit  is  expected  that  locally  purchased  goods  and  services  will  amount  to  $241  million,  and \n2,700 local jobs will be generated. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution  to  Economic  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction  through  Private \nSector Development \n\n26. \nThe  project  will  help  alleviate  Pakistan\u2019s  severe  power  shortage,  which  is  adversely \nimpacting  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  project  will \nincrementally  increase  access  to  energy  for  households,  business,  and  industry.  Use  of \nindigenous  natural  resources  will  result  in  more  affordable  electricity  and  tariffs  that  are  less \nsusceptible  to  fluctuations  in  the  international  fuel  market.  Use  of  indigenous  water  resources \nwill also relieve pressure on the country\u2019s balance of payments, assist in energy security, and \nadd to diversification of the energy mix. The project will demonstrate the advantages of private \nsector  participation  in  power  generation,  and  may  increase  general  investor  and  lender \nconfidence  in  Pakistan.  In  the  long  run,  the  project  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  power \nshortages and the development of indigenous power sources. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n27. \nEconomic benefits emanate from the willingness to pay for power revealed by the tariffs \nto  be  paid.  Economic  costs  include  the  costs  of  preparatory  work,  capital  expenditures,  and \noperating  costs.  The  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  14.2%  exceeds  the  social \ndiscount rate of 10%.13 The economic analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n28. \nThe  project  is  classified  environmental  category  A,  requiring  an  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  were  assessed  in  the  EIA  report  (2010)  conforming  to \nPakistan\u2019s  environmental  rules  and  regulations.  An  addendum  to  the  EIA,  a  detailed \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), a fish study, and a vegetation study\u2014providing more \nenvironmental  assessment  and  planning  information  as  well  as  mitigation  measures\u2014were \nprepared to meet ADB safeguard requirements. The EIA report was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non 16 July 2010 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; the supporting studies \nand  plans  will  also  be  posted  on  the  website.  The  potential  and  adverse  impacts  will  be \nminimized  and  mitigated  as  described  in  the  EIA  report,  EMP,  and  supporting  studies,  with \nStar Hydro deemed to have sufficient capacity to manage environmental and social issues. \n \n29. \nThe  most  significant  potential  construction  impact  will  arise  from  the  generation  and \ndisposal  of  1  million  m3  of  spoil  from  tunneling  and  site  preparation  of  the  weir,  power  house, \nand  switching  yard.  Spoil  will  be  safely  disposed  of  on  low  value  and  approved  riverside  land \ndisposal  sites.  Other  construction  impacts  include  noise  and  dust  generation,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, and those from the influx of construction workers and workers\u2019 health and safety. \nThese impacts are considered manageable and will be addressed by the appropriate mitigation \nmeasures proposed in the EMP.  \n \n\n                                                 \n13 The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group\u2019s  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Private  Sector  Investment  Operations  rates  a \n\nproject satisfactory if the economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nimpacts \n\ninclude  a  substantial  reduction \n\nPotential  adverse  project  operation \n\nin \n30. \nKunhar River  flows  from  the  weir  downstream  to  the  Jhelum  River  confluence  (13.4  km)  for \n7.7 months of the year as a result of flow diversion to the power house. A 2 m3 per second flow \nwill be released from the weir to maintain a living aquatic ecosystem, equivalent to 1.3%\u20136.0% \nof average monthly stream flows. This flow will increase downstream as side stream flows enter \nthe Kunhar River, but the overall flow reduction will degrade the aquatic habitat, and the weir will \nprevent the upstream migration of fish. However, the fish species\u2019 diversity and number in this \nsection of the river are naturally low, partly because of the large temperature difference between \nthe  Kunhar  and  Jhelum  Rivers.  Given  the  relatively  low  fish  habitat  value  of  the  affected \ndownstream section of the Kunhar River, the proposed flow regime is expected to be adequate \nto  address  the  potential  impacts  and  not  to  compromise  any  habitat  with  significant  aquatic \necological values. This section of the Kunhar is not used for domestic water supply or irrigation \nwater;  the  only  use  is  occasional  noncommercial  fishing.  Because  of  this  low  usage  and  the \navailability  of  a  far  greater  fishing  resource  in  the  nearby  Jhelum  River,  the  loss  of  fishing  will \nhave a relatively low impact. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n31. \nThe project has been classified category A with respect to involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C with respect to the impact on indigenous peoples. The project will physically displace \n28  households  (comprised  of  242  persons)  and  affect  about  150  landowners  as  a  result  of \npermanent  (about  40  hectares  [ha])  and  temporary  (about  5  ha)  acquisition  of  land  for  the \nreservoir  impounding,  weir  structure,  power  house  ,  surge  chamber,  access  road,  colony  for \nconstruction staff, labor camp, and batching plant. The affected households/persons have been \ninformed  of  and  consulted  regarding  the  project  activities  and  impacts.  Arrangements  for  the \nvaluation  of  affected  assets  are  participatory  and  include  the  formation  of  a  land  valuation \ncommittee  made  up  of  representatives  of  local  government  bodies,  SHPL,  and  the  affected \nhouseholds.  A  grievance  redress  committee  was  also  set  up  with  representation  from  district \nand local government bodies and the affected households. With respect to indigenous peoples, \nthe project is not expected to affect such groups as the community is comprised of local people \nbelonging  to  settled  districts.  Additional  parcels  of  land  are  being  considered  for  purchase  as \nlandowners  interested  in  selling  their  land  have  approached  SHPL.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan,  which  will  be  revised  based  on  the \ncensus of affected persons and 100% inventory of affected assets after the project final footprint \nis determined. \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n32. \nPublic  consultation  commenced  in  2006  during  the  preliminary  stage  of  project \npreparation. Concerns and issues raised included land acquisition, traffic hazards, employment, \nother project benefits, and cooperation with the community. The most recent consultation was \nconducted during the first quarter of 2011 to inform affected people about the updated project \ndesign and to listen to any comments and concerns, including a public hearing convened by the \nlocal government. A stakeholder engagement plan was also prepared, which provides details on \npublic  consultations  and  subsequent  public  hearings  as  well  as  arrangements  to  ensure  the \ninvolvement of women. Apart from the land acquisition concerns, which will be addressed during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  other  concerns  will  be  addressed  by  instituting \nmitigating  measures  such  as  the  installation  of  a  traffic  alarm  system  and  signs  before  any \nconstruction starts. Qualified locals (both men and women) will be given equal job opportunities \nduring  project  construction  and  operation,  and  SHPL  will  provide  assistance  in  improving \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\n \n\nschools,  health  clinics,  local  drinking  water  structures,  and  other  communal  facilities  such  as \nparks and playgrounds. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nConstruction Arrangements \n\n33. \nDuring  construction,  the  project\u2019s  technical  team  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager \nwho will coordinate with the EPC contractor, as well as with the owner\u2019s engineer and K-water\u2019s \nproject management supervision team. The project manager will be experienced in power plant \nmanagement  and  will  be  responsible  for  meeting  the  plant\u2019s  pre-operation  requirements.          \nK-water\u2019s  supervision  will  complement  the  role  of  owner\u2019s  engineer,  and  will  strengthen  the \noverall project management capacity of SHPL. \n \n34. \nThe project will be constructed under a date-certain lump-sum fixed-price EPC contract. \nThe  EPC  works  will  be  performed  by  Daewoo  Engineering  &  Construction  Company  Limited \nand Sambu Construction Company Limited. \n \n\n2. \n\nOperations Arrangements \n\nK-water, the main sponsor of the project, will also carry out O&M of the project under an \n35. \nO&M agreement. SHPL will benefit from K-water\u2019s industry experience and best practices, and \nwill  be  guided  by  K-water\u2019s  policies,  procedures,  and  standards\u2014particularly  in  the  areas  of \ncarrying  out  major  maintenance  and  overhauls,  O&M  planning  and  budgeting,  and  capacity \nbuilding\u2014and will be subject to periodic audits to monitor compliance in these areas. \n \n\n3. \n\nWater Use \n\nSHPL  will  enter  into  water  use  agreements  (WUAs)  with  the  local  government  bodies, \n36. \nwhich will allow SHPL to have an exclusive right to use water of Khunhar River for the purpose \nof power generation during the term of the power purchase agreement (PPA).  \n \n\n4. \n\nPower Offtake \n\n37. \nThe  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  is  the  power  offtaker  and \nwill purchase electricity from the project under a 30-year take-or-pay PPA. The tariff payable by \nNTDC will be consistent with the tariff determined by NEPRA, and will have two components: a \ncapacity  charge  and  an  energy  charge.  The  capacity  charge  is  based  on  the  plant\u2019s  available \ncapacity and covers the fixed portion of the O&M costs, debt service, and a fixed return on the \nequity investment. NTDC will pay the capacity charge monthly to SHPL\u2014regardless of whether \nelectricity  from  the  project  is  actually  dispatched.  The  energy  charge  is  based  on  the  actual \nvolume of electricity dispatch. It covers water use charges and variable components of the O&M \ncosts.  NTDC  will  pay  the  energy  charge  monthly  to  SHPL.  Both  the  capacity  and  energy \ncomponents  of  the  tariff  may  be  adjusted  to  account  for  inflation  and  fluctuations  in  foreign \nexchange and interest rates. Under the PPA,  NTDC will also complete, operate, and maintain \nthe interconnection facilities and the transmission lines. \n \n\n5. \n\nRole of the Government of Pakistan \n\n38. \nThe government plays a crucial role in the project as well as for other IPPs in Pakistan. \nIts  obligations  are  set  out  under  an  implementation  agreement  with  SHPL.  Under  the \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nimplementation agreement, the government grants the company the exclusive right to develop, \nown,  and  operate  the  project,  subject  to  applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  certain  other \nobligations,  for  a  period  of  30  years.  Among  the  principal  functions  of  the  implementation \nagreement  is  to  provide  a  guarantee  to  the  company,  sponsors,  and  lenders  that  the  various \ngovernment  entities  and  agencies  will  meet  their  contractual  obligations\u2014including  paying \namounts due on time.  \n \n\n6. \n\nProcurement \n\n39. \nThe  project  developer  was  selected  through  international  competitive  bidding,  and  the \nPPIB  issued  a  letter  of  interest  to  the  Emirates  Trading  Agency  and  TransAsia  Gas \nInternational, both subsidiaries of the Al-Ghurair Group from the United Arab Emirates based on \nthe  technical  and  financial  criteria.  In  August  2009,  the  PPIB  approved  a  change  of  SHPL \nownership  to  the  consortium  of  K-water,  Daewoo  E&C,  and  Sambu  after  conducting  due \ndiligence  of  the  consortium  on  the  same  criteria  as  in  the  original  developer  bid.  The  EPC \ncontract was tendered competitively. \n \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n40. \nSHPL  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  its \nPolicy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require SHPL to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The \nloan documentation between ADB and SHPL will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\n41. \nSHPL  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  quarterly \nconstruction or operations reports, and annual operating budgets to ADB and the other lenders, \nand must report any material changes. The company will be required to hire an internationally \nreputable  accounting  firm  (or  its  local  affiliate)  to  audit  its  annual  accounts  in  line  with \ninternational financial reporting standards. ADB will monitor the project\u2019s construction progress \nand  operational  performance,  using  information  from  public  sources,  lender\u2019s  advisors,  and \ngovernment statistics. The project will be evaluated on two levels: (i) the success of the project, \nincluding  its  completion,  commissioning,  and  operation;  and  (ii)  impacts  beyond  the  project, \nincluding  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  the  increase  of  private  sector  participation  in \nPakistan\u2019s  energy  sector.  The  performance  indicators  are  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n42. \nADB will provide a loan of up to $97 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources without government guarantee. The loan amount will not exceed 25% of the final total \nproject cost approved by NEPRA upon completion. Proceeds of the loan will be used for eligible \nproject costs. \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nADB Loan \n\n \n\n\f11\n\n \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe proposed assistance by ADB to the project is justified for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe project will add base load power generation capacity, which will help reduce \nload  shedding  in  Pakistan  and  strengthen  the  supply  network  and  stabilize \nvoltage of the local grid system. \nThe  project  will  use  indigenous  water  resources  to  supply  affordable  electricity \nand  reduce  reliance  on  expensive  oil  imports.  This  will  significantly  reduce  the \nvolatility of the project\u2019s electricity tariff compared with other types of fuel-based \npower  projects  and  relieve  stress  on  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves. \nFurthermore, it will contribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security. \nThe  project  will  save  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  generating  clean \nelectricity to the grid and is likely to satisfy the eligible requirements for availing of \nthe Clean Development Mechanism established under the Kyoto Protocol of the \nUnited  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  Expected  revenues \nfrom  the  sale  of  certified  emission  reductions  credits,  which  is  based  on  about \n280,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emission  reductions  per  year,  is  anticipated  to \nimprove the project\u2019s cash flows. The project would also benefit from assistance \nfrom ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative. \nThe project will create job opportunities for local people during construction and \noperation  of  the  project,  and  will  support  socioeconomic  advancement  in  a \nremote and economically deprived area. \nADB\u2019s active participation and presence in the project will reassure the sponsors \nand  other  lenders  that  the  government  and  government  entities  will  continue  to \nsupport  the  project.  Given  ADB\u2019s  track  record  and  ongoing  engagement  in \nPakistan\u2019s  energy  sector\u2014including  policy  dialogue,  public  sector  reform \nprograms, and recent financing of key IPPs through private sector operations\u2014\nproject participants will value ADB\u2019s role in mitigating risk, solving problems, and \ncatalyzing  financial  resources  to  support  private  sector  power  projects  in \nPakistan. \nADB\u2019s  assistance  is  considered  indispensable  to  achieve  financial  close.  The \nlong-term  financing  that  ADB  will  provide  is  essential  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the project, and would not otherwise be easily available from \ncommercial sources under the present financial and country environment. \nThe  proposed  assistance  to  the  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment  plan  and  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategies  as  discussed  in  this  report \n(paras. 16\u201318). \n\n \nC. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with \n\nthe  Agreement  Establishing \n\n44. \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank \n(the Charter),14 no funding will be disbursed until ADB is satisfied that the principles enumerated \nunder Article 14 have been met.

Strategy  2020  puts \nparticular  emphasis  on  expanding  energy  supplies  and  promoting  energy  efficiency  through  supply-side  measures. \nStrategy  2020  also  emphasizes  private  sector  development  and  private  sector  participation.  The  project  will  fit  with \nthese  priorities  as  it  will  add  new  electric  generation  capacity  to  the  country  through  private  sector  participation  in \ndeveloping clean energy sources. The project remains fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,b under which support \nto  renewable  energy  generation  has  been  identified  as  a  key  priority.  The  project  will  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction by supporting economic development and providing critically needed power to support economic activities. \n \nB. \n \n1.  Key  issues.  The  project  will  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  economic  development  of \nPakistan and by providing critically needed power to support economic activities.  Reliable power supply will contribute \ntoward  improvement  of  transportation,  communication,  education,  and  health  services  as  well  as  encourage  the \nestablishment of livelihood enterprises and increase development opportunities for people of the area.  On a localized \nlevel, the project will entail involuntary resettlement impacts such as loss of residential housing and acquisition of land \n(farmland,  wasteland,  and  riverbed  land).  The  mitigation  and  compensation  arrangements  of  these  impacts  will  be \ndefined in the resettlement plan. \n \n2.  Design  features.  The  project  is  designed  primarily  to  promote  sustainable  economic  growth  by  increasing  the \nsupply of energy to reduce a growing energy deficit, and enhance access to electricity for households, business, and \nindustry.  The  development  impact  of  the  project  also  includes  environmental  benefits  through  more  efficient  use  of \nindigenous and renewable energy resources.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis   \n \nSocial  safeguard  planning.  Involuntary  resettlement  is  the  main  social  impact  related  to  the  project.  The  aspect  of \nacquisition  of  land  in  terms  of  land  area  requirement  and  infrastructure  falling  within  the  project  area  was  also \ninvestigated.  This  involved  consultations  and  scoping  sessions  with  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  like \nlandowners, local people, storekeepers, and religious community leaders. The cost of land, built-up property, economic \ntrees, and others were discussed with the owners, local people, and revenue department staff. The draft resettlement \nplan prepared for the project reveals that about 40 hectares (ha) of land (farmland and/or wasteland and riverbed land) \nwill  be  permanently  acquired;  about  5  ha  will  be  temporarily  acquired  and  used  as  area  for  the  labor  camp  and  use \nduring  the  construction  phase  of  the  project;  28  households  (comprised  of  242  persons)  will  be  displaced;  a  single \ncommercial asset described as rudimentary water mill facility; and around 624 economic trees. The compensation for \nthese assets, including livelihood restoration programs, will be governed by the entitlement matrix in the resettlement \nplan. \n \nStakeholders  engagement.  A  stakeholders  engagement  plan  was  prepared  to  provide  details  on  how  public \nconsultations  and  subsequent  public  hearings,  as  well  as  arrangements  to  ensure  involvement  of  women,  will  be \nengaged and documented. During community consultations, the community raised concerns such as land acquisition, \ntraffic hazards, employment, project benefits, and community engagement. The resolutions to these issues are mainly \ndocumented in the resettlement plan and other project agreement documents. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                            Appendix 2 \n\n15\n\nCore labor standards. The due diligence of Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) concludes that it will ensure fair, safe, \nand healthy working conditions in its operations and during construction through its contractors and subcontractors. It \nwill  also  ensure  that  applicable  national  labor  laws  and  regulation,  consistent  with  the  core  labor  standards,  will  be \nfollowed  in  its  human  resources  dealings  and  in  engaging  contractors  and  subcontractors.  The  prevailing  labor  and \nindustrial  relations  laws  guaranteeing  freedom  of  association,  collective  bargaining,  nondiscrimination,  individual \nworker grievance resolution, and arbitration of labor disputes, will apply.  \n \nCorporate  social  responsibility.  SHPL  will  engage  responsive  corporate  social  responsibility  programs.  Initially \nidentified are activities related to developing and improving the educational and health facilities near the project area. \nThe land that will be temporarily acquired will later be turned into playground and community parks. Other activities will \nbe implemented in consultation with the various community stakeholders. \n \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nB. \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during project preparation.  \nCommunity  consultations  were  carried  out  in  the  project  area  through  formal  and  informal  meetings,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  and  interviews.  The  consultants  and  SHPL  staff  initiated  the  sessions  by  giving  a  brief,  simple,  and \nnontechnical  description  of  the  project  providing  an  overview  of  all  likely  positive  and  negative  impacts.  This  was \nfollowed by an open discussion in which all participants were encouraged to voice their concerns and opinions. Apart \nfrom  consultations  with  the  local  community,  consultations  with  public  representatives  concerned  and  officials  of  the \nrelevant line government departments were also held.  \n \n2. What level of C&P is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Consultation      \n\n Collaborative decision making      \n\n Information sharing    \n\n Empowerment \n\n       \n\n No  \n\n Yes \n\nGender and Development                 Gender Mainstreaming Category: Some gender benefits \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared for project implementation? \n \nSHPL  prepared  a  stakeholders  engagement  plan  detailing  how  public  consultations  and  public  hearing  and  other \nengagement with stakeholders will be engaged and documented.  \n \nC. \n \n1. Key issues. Generally, the project will not cause any specific cultural or social impact on any distinct socioeconomic \ngroups, including  women, although the involuntary resettlement impacts of the project may directly affect households \nand  landholdings  headed  or  owned  by  women.  This  type  of  impact  will  be  adequately  mitigated  based  on  the \nentitlement matrix and will be monitored to ensure that affected or displaced people are as good or even better after the \nproject  is  constructed.  On  the  corporate  social  responsibility  front,  programs  will  be  designed  and  implemented  by \nclosely  coordinating  with  community  stakeholders  including  women\u2019s  groups,  if  applicable.  A  program  designed  and \nimplemented by the stakeholders is expected to solicit strong participation and generate positive results. On engaging \nlocal  laborers,  equal  opportunity  for  qualified  men  and  women  will  be  observed.  Fair,  safe,  and  appropriate  work \nconditions will be secured in recognition of women\u2019s distinct workplace requirements during construction and operation \nphases. \n \n2. Key  actions.

The  gap  resulted  in  a  major  power  supply \ndeficit. Many of Pakistan\u2019s rural areas do not have access to electric power and about half of the \npopulation  is  not  connected  to  the grid.  Among  the  electricity  generated,  conventional  thermal \nplants using mainly oil and gas account for 64.2% of Pakistan\u2019s power generation capacity, with \nhydroelectricity contributing 33.4% and nuclear energy 2.4%. The initiatives undertaken by the \nGovernment of Pakistan include new or expanded generation capacities by thermal and hydro \nindependent power producers under the Power Policy 2002, securing electricity and gas imports \nfrom regional projects, as well as tapping the huge potential renewable energy sources.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  involves  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  147  megawatt  run-of-river \nhydroelectric power generation facility between the Kunhar and Jhelum Rivers on a build-own-\noperate-transfer basis for a period of 30 years from the commercial operations date. \n \nB. \n\nValuation of Economic Benefits and Costs \n\n3. \nThe  economic  analysis  for  the  project  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 1 The  values  in  the \neconomic  analysis  reflect  2010  price  levels.  This  economic  analysis  is  carried  out  using  the \nworld price numeraire. Domestic resources and nontraded items are adjusted with the standard \nconversion  factor  of  0.91.2 The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  calculated  from  2011,  the \nstarting year of construction of the facility, to 2045, the end of the concession period. \n\n1. \n\nValuation of Economic Benefits \n\n4. \nWith Pakistan\u2019s energy supply deficit, the power produced by the plant is not expected to \nsubstitute  away  from  existing  generation  capacity,  thus  the  entire  output  of  the  plant  is \nconsidered incremental. The tariff paid is considered the willingness to pay for this incremental \npower. Annual savings of carbon dioxide emissions are valued at $10 per ton of carbon dioxide. \n\n2. \n\nValuation of Economic Costs \n\n5. \nCapital  and  operating  costs  exclude  interest  during  construction,  fees  and  taxes,  and \nfinancing costs. Shadow prices for foreign and domestic resources are applied accordingly. All \nlabor  is  considered  skilled,  since  less  than  2%  of  labor  costs  come  from  unskilled  labor \nrequirements.  Environmental  costs  are  included  in  the  capital  costs.  Project  preparatory  costs \nare also included in the capital costs. About 70% of annual operating economic costs relate to \nthe maintenance of the infrastructure, and is therefore fixed. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.
