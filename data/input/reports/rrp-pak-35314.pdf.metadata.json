It will also facilitate building the institutional capacity of \nnewly  established  local  government  institutions  and  improving \ncommunities\u2019 health and hygiene. The Project includes a social \nuplift and poverty eradication program, which will address core \npoverty  issues  by  providing  income-generating  opportunities  to \ncommunities together with the education benefits linked with the \nprovision of WSS facilities. \n \nIt follows the successful implementation of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)-assisted phase I project1 which successfully achieved \nits development objectives particularly, poverty reduction, gender \nand development, and environmental improvement.  \n   \nRationale  Punjab  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  province  with  a  population  of \napproximately 84 million, or around 62% of the country\u2019s total of \n135 million. About 60% of the Punjab's population live in rural \nsettlements, and 36% are classified as poor. The overall water \nsupply  coverage  in  rural  Punjab  is  53%;  about  half  of  that  is \nprovided by piped systems and the rest through community hand \npumps. The remaining 47% of households rely on often distantly \nlocated sources of unsafe water, such as uncovered wells, rivers, \nand rain-fed or canal-fed ponds.  Similarly, only about 27% of the \nrural population has access to sanitation facilities in the form of \nhousehold latrines.  About half of the villages are located in areas \nof brackish, polluted, or scarce water. \n                                                 \n1  ADB.1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nPakistan for the Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Manila. The loan was closed on 31 May \n2002. Loan accounts are scheduled to be closed on 31 December 2002. ", "   \n  Lack of water impacts on the lowest income groups, especially \nwomen and children who spend much time in fetching water. This \ntask causes the women to lose out on productive opportunities \nwhile children lose out on educational opportunities. These groups \nalso suffer significantly from water-borne diseases due to the use \nof water unfit for human consumption and from the high cost of \nheath care due to illness. The provision of clean water will enable \nthese beneficiaries to make more productive use of their time and \nwill yield significant health benefits.    \n   \n  Under  its  poverty  reduction  strategy,  the  Government  is \ncommitted  to  meeting  the  demand  of  the  village  communities \nthrough  its  own  resources  and  by  utilizing  the  financial  and \ntechnical  resources  of  various  external  support  agencies. \nHowever, the completion of the multidonor-supported social action \nprogram, which included rural WSS as one of its components, has \ngrossly handicapped the Government in meeting its commitment. \nIn  addition,  lack  of  capacity  of  recently  established  local \ngovernment institutions to provide and manage adequate WSS \nfacilities,  and  lack  of  resources  to  yield  adequate  economic \nbenefits  to  communities  are  major  constraints  faced  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  reduce \npoverty by building on the phase I project experiences to construct \ncost-effective WSS subprojects for about 2,500 villages, involving \ncommunities  in  planning,  designing,  and  implementing \nsubprojects;  build  the  capacity  of  participating  tehsil  municipal \nadministrations (TMAs); and through the complementary social \nuplift and poverty eradication  program, yield economic benefits to \npoor communities. The project beneficiaries have been estimated \nto be about 2.3 million.  \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The overall goal is to reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand the quality of life of the communities in rural settlements in \nPunjab  province  where  water  is  scarce  and  groundwater  is \nbrackish.  The objectives are to (i) extend water supply, drainage, \nand sanitation coverage to poor village communities that do not \nhave access to organized water supply and are located in the \nbrackish and barani areas of Punjab, using a community-based, \ndemand-driven approach; (ii) strengthen and build the capacity of \nnewly  constituted  TMAs  to  organize  community-based  water \nsupply  and  drainage  development  and  improve  other  related \nmanagement  functions;  (iii)  implement  a  hygiene  education \nprogram  including  assistance  to  selected  beneficiaries  in  the \nproject  tehsils  for  constructing  household  latrines  using  a \nrevolving  fund;  and  (iv)  implement  a  social  uplift  and  poverty \neradication program aimed at using the time saved by women and \nchildren  from  fetching  water    to    more    productive  livelihood \nactivities through a microcredit system and  construct additional  \nclassrooms  in  schools  where  enrollment  has  increased  when \nchildren were freed from the task of fetching water.   \n   ", "  v\n  Currently, 54 tehsils of 26 districts  (out of a total 34 districts) \nwhere significant water scarcity or brackish groundwater exists \nhave been selected for the Project. The Project will also cover \nother tehsils where villages with similar conditions are identified \nduring the execution of the Project. Subprojects will be selected  \non the basis of criteria (Appendix - 2), to be implemented with \nactive participation of both male and female groups. \n \n  The Project consists of four parts: \n   \n  Part A \u2013 Construction of water supply and drainage facilities. \n  Construction  of  about  500  community-based  simple,  low-cost \n  water  supply  and  drainage    subprojects,    and  rehabilitation  of  \n  about 250   need-based inoperative old subprojects, meeting the \nsub-project selection criteria.  The new  subprojects will include \nabout 450 pump-based schemes, and 50 gravity-based schemes. \nAt least 10 sites will be identified for the rain-harvesting schemes.  \n   \nPart B \u2013 Hygiene education program. Carrying out a hygiene \neducation program as formulated and implemented in the phase I \nproject.  Education  material,  service  vehicles,  and  consulting \nservices will be provided to support the program. This part also \nincludes  establishing  a  revolving  fund  to  assist  selected \nbeneficiaries in project villages to install household latrines. All \nschools in the project area will be provided adequate supply of \nsafe drinking water and latrines. \n \nPart C \u2013 Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. \nStrengthening and building the capacity of the local government \ninstitutions including TMAs in all districts of Punjab by providing \nconsulting  services,  management  information  system  (MIS) \nsoftware, and education material. The project management unit \n(PMU) of the Housing, Urban Development, and Public Health \nEngineering Department (HUD&PHED) will be provided consulting \nservices,  equipment,  service  vehicles,  and  operational  cost \nsupport for the community development unit (CDU) and project \nimplementation offices.  \n \n  Part  D  -  Social  Uplift  and  Poverty  Eradication  Program \n(SUPER). Two key interventions are (i) microcredit schemes for \nusing the time saved, mainly by women and children, in more \nproductive and livelihood activities; and (ii) constructing additional \nclassrooms  in  the  village  schools  where  existing  space  is  not \nenough to accommodate additional children who have been freed \nfrom  the  chore  of  fetching  drinking  water.  SUPER  covers  the \nprovision  of  financial  assistance,  a  local  community  liaison \nadvisor,  and  service  vehicles,  initially  in  the  selected  phase  I \nproject communities and later, based on success, to the remaining \nareas of phase I project and the proposed Project. This phase will \nintroduce  subborrowers  to  group-based  microfinance, which will\n   ", "   \n  lead  to  linkages  with  the  microfinance  institutions  and  greater \naccess to microfinance services. The interest rate charged will be \nconsistent with those of the established microfinance institutions. \n \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $71.4  million \nequivalent, of which $13.6 million is the foreign currency cost, and \n$57.8 million equivalent is the local currency.   \n   \nFinancing Plan          (million) \n  Foreign  Local     \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percentage \nADB  13.6  36.4  50.0  70.0 \nGovernment  0.0  16.8  16.8  23.5 \nBeneficiaries  0.0  4.6  4.6  6.5 \n Total  13.6  57.8    71.4  100.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  37,885,000  ($50  million \nequivalent) from the Asian Development Fund. The loan will have \na term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  ADB will provide the loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, \nTerms  which will relend it to the Government of Punjab on the same \nterms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will, however, be \nborne by the Government of Punjab, which will make the loan \nproceeds available to HUD&PHED as a grant through budgetary \nallocation.   \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2006 \n   \nImplementation  Keeping in view the successful experience in the phase I project, \nArrangements  the  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), located at the provincial HUD&PHED. \nThe  appointed  project  director,  project  implementation  units  \n(PIUs)  set  up  in  six  representative  districts,  and  project \nimplementation  cells  (PICs)  at  13  tehsil  headquarters  will \ncoordinate, manage, and implement the project activities. Union \ncouncils (UCs) and TMAs will identify subprojects in coordination \nwith the CDU staff of the Project. On the basis of the extensive \nfield visits, the PMU and the TMAs/UCs jointly will shortlist the \nsubprojects. \n   \nExecuting Agency  HUD&PHED of Punjab \n   \n   ", "  vii\nProcurement  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines for Procurement  reflecting \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s standard \nbidding documents. Because most of the civil and mechanical \nworks are small and are unlikely to attract international firms, they \nwill  be  carried  out  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. To expedite implementation of the Project, the \nGovernment will retain the PMU of the phase I project and take \nadvance  action  in  recruiting  consultants  and  prequalifying \ncontractors.  On  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  approved \nretroactive  financing  of  $100,000  for  undertaking  advance  \ntechnical surveys of the identified subprojects. \n \nConsulting Services  Overall consulting services will include (i) 613 person-months from \ndomestic  consultants  to  support  project  implementation;  (ii)  4 \nperson-months from an international consultant, on an intermittent \nbasis,  to  provide  overall  project  management  advice  and \nsupervision;  and  (iii)  572  person-months  from  domestic \ncommunity  development  officers  (CDOs)  for  undertaking \ncommunity  development  activities.    All  the  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide organized WSS facilities to about 2,500 \nBeneficiaries  village communities located in areas of acute water scarcity or \nwhere groundwater is brackish and unfit for human consumption. \nThe socioeconomic surveys for the Project and also in the phase I \nproject revealed that household income for more than 90% of the \nproject area is below PRs3,800 ($63) per month. Therefore, the \nProject  will  be  implemented  in  extremely  poor  areas  of  rural \nPunjab. An estimated 2.3 million will directly benefit from the WSS \nsubprojects.  The main benefit is the economic value of the time \nsaved  by  women  in  fetching  water  and  diverted  to  activities \nleading to the socioeconomic well-being of the household. The \nexperience from the phase I project suggests that the resultant \ntime saving has significantly reduced the stress on women and \ngirls. With water supply on their doorstep, women can contribute \ntheir  labor  input  in  farm-related  activities,  tend  livestock,  and \npursue  other  off-farm  income-generating  activities.  Moreover, \nwomen have more time for household chores and better child \ncare. Girls who used to share the burden of fetching water and \nthus miss school are now able to attend school regularly. These \nactivities have significant social and economic benefits. \n \nIn  addition,  there  are  significant  health-related  benefits.  The \ndecreased morbidity rates and infant mortality are visible benefits. \nThe   access  to   clean  water  has   significantly    reduced    the  \n   ", "   \n  incidence of waterborne diseases and other illnesses, and the \nresultant productivity loss due to absenteeism in the workplace. \nSimilarly, elimination of stagnant ponds, which served as breeding \nplace  for  mosquitoes,  and  cleaner  streets  due  to  the \ncomplementary improved drainage investment have contributed \nconsiderably to environmental improvement.   \n  Strengthening  the  TMAs  will  build  their  capacity  to  ensure \nsustainability of the subprojects and enable them to implement \nsimilar subprojects in the future in an ongoing manner. This will \nsubstantially accelerate the achievement of the sector goals.  \n  \nImplementation of the Project will result in substantial savings in \ntime and a reduced health burden, and rural women will be the \nmain beneficiaries. Through its SUPER program, the Project will \naim  at  boosting  village  economies  by  using  time  savings  of \nwomen and children in productive and livelihood activities. It will \nalso result in manifold increases in school enrollment, particularly \nof girls, as experienced in the phase I project.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  phase  I  project  experience  allows  a  reasonably  accurate \nassessment  of  the  project  risks  and  advance  provision  of \nsafeguards. \n \n  Assumptions used in project design and feasibility are based on \nthe  biannual  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  of  the \nphase  I  project,  which  was  also  independently  verified  by  the \nconsultants during preparation of the Project. A description of the \nanticipated risks and proposed safeguards follows. \n   \n  There  is  a  possibility  of  political  interference  in  subproject \nselection  by  the  newly  installed  local  governments,  elected \nnational/provincial assembly members, or political elites. The risks \nwill  be  mitigated  by  broadly  disseminating  and  transparently \napplying the subproject selection criteria. During implementation \nof the phase I project and the preparation of the proposed Project, \nthe  criteria  had  been  widely  disseminated  to  make  selection \ntransparent.  Further,  the  role  and  the  responsibilities  of \nconsultants,  as  independent  evaluators,  have  been  enhanced. \nThe results of the needs assessment survey for each subproject \nwill be prepared by the CDU staff; they will be reviewed and \nverified by the consultants and submitted to ADB with the monthly \nprogress report. \n   \n  Lack  of  adequate  attention  by  CDU  staff  in  forming  strong \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  and  building  their \ncapacities through comprehensive training, and lack of community \ninvolvement in preparing and executing the subproject can result \nin unsustainable operation after the handover of the subprojects. \nFrom  the  phase I  project   experience, community  development \n   ", "  ix\n  techniques have been improved and the role of CDU has been \nstrengthened. Mandatory training for CBOs, and enhancement of \ncommunity participation, particularly gender involvement in project \npreparation, will rectify these risks.     \n \nIn a few instances in the past, the community members  backed  \nout    of  their  commitments  to  taking  over  the  subprojects  for \noperation  and  maintenance.  Experience  with  other  community-\nbased projects reveals that effective community participation at an \nearly stage and the community contribution toward capital cost \ncan greatly minimize this risk. \n \n   \nThere remains the potential hazard of installing a tubewell for \nextracting  groundwater  for  irrigation  use  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nestablished  water  supply  source  of  any  subproject  which  can  \nadversely effect the quality and quantity of water.  The CBOs, with \nthe  active  support  of  TMAs,  will  ensure  that  no  groundwater \nextraction  will  take  place  in  the  vicinity  of  the  water  sources \ndeveloped under the Project. \n \nSignificant  delays  in  the  electrification  of  tubewells,  as \nexperienced in the phase I project, may prevent the communities \nfor several months from benefiting even after the subprojects are  \nphysically completed. Advance actions during the implementation \nof  subprojects  in  applying  for  electric  connections,  and  timely \npayment to the Water and Power Development Authority, together \nwith intensive follow-up, can eliminate this risk. \n \n  \n \n \n   ", "   \n   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n2.  The Government is concerned about the low levels of social services, particularly in rural \nareas, and believes that greater investment in basic social services will accelerate gains in \nproductivity,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  smaller,  healthier,  and  better  educated  families. \nNationally, the Government has identified low water supply and sanitation coverage as one of \nthe major issues confronting the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Pakistan1. At \npresent, the overall water supply coverage in Pakistan is 63% and sanitation 39% of the total \npopulation.   \n \n3.  Punjab  is  the  most  heavily  populated  province  of  Pakistan.  Despite  its  apparently \naffluent agricultural economy, the social indicators of Punjab compare poorly with those of most \nother provinces in the country. In fiscal year (FY) 1999, 33% of Punjab's population was poor, \nand in rural Punjab it was 36% compared with 29% in FY932.  During 1998/99 infant mortality in \nPunjab was 95 per 1,000 live births, against 89 for the country as a whole. At present, overall \nwater supply coverage in rural Punjab is 53%; about half of that is provided by piped systems  \nand the  rest  through  community hand pumps. The remaining 47% of households have to rely \non often distantly located sources of unsafe water-uncovered wells, rivers, and rain-fed/canal-\nfed ponds - generally transported by women and children. These groups suffer significantly from \nwaterborne diseases due to the use of water unfit for human consumption, and the cost of heath \ncare due to illness is high. Similarly, only about 27% of the rural population have access to \nsanitation facilities in the form of household latrines. The remaining population defecate in open \nareas, a situation that is particularly difficult for females, as by custom they can only use the \nfields either before sunrise or after sunset. The idea of health benefits being associated with \ngood hygiene practices needs strengthening if the health of rural communities is to improve. \nDrainage in rural areas is very poor and maintenance of existing drains is commonly neglected, \nwhich results in health hazards such as insect infestations and an environmental hazard such \nas unpleasant odors.   \n     \n4.  While some aid-/NGO-assisted projects are addressing the WSS problems of smaller \nvillage  communities3,  larger  villages  remain  unserved  owing  to  financial  and  technical \nconstraints. The financial allocations to the sector form a small fraction of the total budgetary \noutlay on social services. As a share in the total budgetary allocations, the amount is estimated \nto be as low as 0.18% of the GDP, and only 0.83% of the total expenditures on public health \nservices. The Government\u2019s 10-year (2001-2011) Perspective Development Plan (PDP) has a \ngross allocation of only 6.8% for physical planning and housing sector, only 1.1% of which has \nbeen earmarked for WSS. This compares poorly with the 18% available for transport and \ncommunications, and 14% for power. The result is severe cash-flow problems in implementing \n                                                 \n1  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission 2001.

", "2   \nthe nationwide public health engineering departments\u2019 (PHED's) ongoing projects, with many \nWSS schemes remaining incomplete. \n \n5.  Nationwide,  PHEDs  have  constructed  schemes  following  a  top  down  approach  to \nplanning  and  have  designed  schemes  that  were  costly  and  technically  difficult  for  local \ncommunities  to  maintain.  In  view  of  this,  the  Government,  with  assistance  from  external \nagencies sought to lift the constraints on the rural water supply sector\u2019s performance. In 1992, it \nmandated the adoption of a uniform policy framework nationwide for rural WSS, and each \nprovincial government has adopted this policy framework, which provides that (i) for all new \nrural  WSS  schemes,  the  communities  will  be  involved  in  design  and  implementation.  The \nGovernment will provide the investment cost. After their completion, the schemes would be \nhanded over to the communities for full operation and maintenance (O&M); (ii) all ongoing \nschemes, and those requiring rehabilitation, managed by PHED, will be handed over to the \ncommunities; (iii) PHED will provide the communities with training in O&M of the schemes; and \n(iv) to cover O&M cost, the communities will open an O&M account at the local bank, deposit an \namount  equivalent  to  2  months'  O&M  expenses  as  an  initial  commitment,  and  designate \nrepresentatives to operate the account and maintain the schemes. Detailed subproject selection \ncriteria following the uniform framework for the rural WSS sector are in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  To specifically address the WSS problem in rural Punjab, the Government, in 1994, \nrequested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  A loan of $46 million from the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources was approved by ADB in January 1995 for the \nPunjab Rural WSS Sector Project (phase I project) to provide low-cost, low-technology WSS \nsubprojects in seven districts where the situation was serious. The Project, which was closed in \nMay 2002, has provided safe drinking water and drainage facilities to about 800,000 people of \n335 mostly poor and remote villages of 7 priority districts (out of a total 34 districts) of Punjab \nthrough  simple,  low-cost  subprojects  using  the  community-based  approach.  The  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation carried out under the project and verified during the preparation of the \nproposed Project has indicated that the project had considerable development impacts such as \nsignificant  decrease  in  the  cases  of  waterborne  diseases,  increase  in  household  income, \nincrease in enrollment of schoolchildren, and considerable environmental improvement. The \ncommunities of the project districts are responsible for 100% O&M cost of the subprojects and \nall the subprojects that were handed over are being operated by communities without any major \nproblem.  The  demonstrated  success  of  the  phase  I  project  has  not  only  created  myriad \nopportunities  to  the  mostly  very  poor  (beneficiary  communities)  getting  rid  of  waterborne \ndiseases and diverting their time savings to income-generating activities, it has also created \nawareness of the benefits of community-based WSS projects from the Government subsidized \ninefficient WSS sector to an efficient community-run system.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Experience in the phase I project reveals that the provision of safe drinking water in the \nhouse or close to it saves substantial time of the village communities, particularly women. It thus \ngenerates a demand for credit and technical assistance to setup income-generating ventures \nand help the women to get out of acute poverty. Similarly, due to increased school enrollment \nas a result of providing of water at their doorstep, children, particularly girls, need additional \nspace in school. At present, no such resources/mechanisms exist in the poor communities to \nenable the people to utilize the time saved from fetching water and fully address the issue of \npoverty reduction and social development. \n \n     ", "3 \n8.  Another set of problems and opportunities is due to the devolution plan, which has \ndecentralized  administrative  and  financial  authority  to  local  government  institutions  for \ngovernance, delivery of services, and transparent decision making through institutionalized \nparticipation of the people at the grassroot level. But, while these institutions have now been \nentrusted  with  substantial  autonomy  and  heavy  responsibilities,  they  lack  the  necessary \ncapacity to carry out these tasks by themselves and for this purpose still rely on the resources of \nthe provincial line departments. If the situation continues, increased delays in decision making, \ndeclining service standards, and reversal to the previous levels of centralization are likely.  \n \n9.  As part of the devolution process, the line department PHED, primarily responsible for \nWSS  in  the  province,  was  dismantled  up  to  the  higher  middle  order  management \n(superintendent engineer). The responsibilities for the delivery and O&M of these services are \nnow  entrusted  to  the  tehsil  municipal  administration  (TMA),  where  in  most  cases  a  junior \nengineer (tehsil officer for infrastructure and services) looks after these services, in addition to a \nhost  of  other  responsibilities.  This  situation  has  particularly  affected  the  WSS  sector. \nDevelopment of an adequate capacity in TMAs may take several years, stretching beyond the 4 \nyears of the project implementation period, keeping these institutions from playing a primary role \nin handling subproject construction. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure the meaningful \ninvolvement of the devolved institutions in the Project at present and to prepare them to take \nover  long-term  sector  development  responsibilities.  Accordingly,  a  two-pronged  approach \nincluding project implementation and institutional capacity building will be pursued. Owing to the \ncurrent deficient capacity of the devolved institutions, project implementation will be carried out \nthrough  the  existing  PMU,  which  has  successfully  implemented  the  phase  I  project.  The \ncapacity  of  the  TMA  will  be  simultaneously  enhanced  to  handle  the  community-based \nimplementation of similar subprojects in the future. During the preparation of the proposed \nProject, a preliminary assessment of the TMA constraints and weaknesses was made, and a \nphased program of capacity building and institutional strengthening was designed for all levels \n(Appendix  3).  The  program  encompasses  resource  mobilization,  human  resources \ndevelopment,  establishment  of  a  computerized  management  information  system,  and \nadministration of a complementary training program. To be effective, the program will be carried \nout along with physical improvements in service levels, through a meaningful involvement of all \nconcerned.  \n     \n10.  Limited  access  to  WSS  facilities  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  common \ncharacteristics  of  poverty  in  the  country  and  the  root  cause  of  health-related  problems. \nAccordingly, the 10-year PDP aims at increasing the overall coverage of safe drinking water to \n84% and that of sanitation to 63%. For rural settlements its target is to achieve 75% coverage of \nsafe water supply and 50% for sanitation and drainage. In its poverty reduction strategy, the \nPDP also emphasizes the provision of adequate funding for clean air and water to Pakistani \ncitizens, promotion of small and intermediate enterprises, and capacity building for institutions \ndelivering services. \n \n11.  The Government has resolved to continue implementing the rural WSS programs, in \naccordance with its uniform policy framework. The recently completed ADB-assisted Water \nSector Strategy Study (2002) also endorsed that rural WSS schemes should be community \nbased and O&M should be borne by the beneficiaries4. This is important for ensuring the \nparticipation  of  beneficiary  communities  in  all  stages  of  development,  planning,  designing, \nimplementing,  and  O&M.  However,  to  be  effective,  the  newly  installed  local  government \n                                                 \n4  An allocation of PRs10 billion, which is based on the recommended allocations for water resources, was made in \nthe midterm investment plan (2002-11) for rural water supply and sanitation sector projects. \n ", "4   \ninstitutions need a clearer definition of their roles and responsibility, a setting up of vivid vertical \nand horizontal linkages, and substantial capacity building through a carefully structured and \nsustained human resource development program.  \n \n12.  Most WSS projects in Pakistan have been supported by international aid agencies. \nApproximately $563 million of external assistance has been committed to WSS since 1995.  \n(Appendix  4).  While  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  been  the  main  sources  of  financial \nassistance,  United  Nations  International  Children's  Emergency  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  United \nNations  Development  Program  (UNDP)  have  been  assisting  through  awareness  raising, \nadvocacy,  institutional  strengthening/capacity  building,  and  networking.  Besides  these,  a \nnumber of bilateral external support agencies, including Canadian International Development \nAgency, Department for International Development (DFID), Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), have been among \nthe  most  active  partners  in  the  sector.  A  number  of  national,  provincial  and  local  non \ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  like  National  Rural  Support  Program  (NRSP)  and  the \nProvincial Rural Support Program (PRSP) are also playing an important role in community \ndevelopment in support of WSS. There are thus numerous opportunities to attain synergies by \nworking  in  collaboration  with  these  agencies,  particularly  in  awareness  raising,  household \nsanitation, hygiene education, and microcredit for income generation among the beneficiaries of \nWSS schemes. The successful implementation of the phase I project presents a strong case for \nreplication in the hitherto unserved areas of the province. \n \n13.  ADB's  sector  loan  modality  was  selected  to  provide  the  assistance  because  it  is \nconsidered the most appropriate method of financing the Project. ADB's sector loan criteria \nhave been generally met. As part of the Government's PDP, the rural water supply sector \ninvestment plan under the Project is well-conceived and appropriately formulated to meet the \npriority needs of the sector. The sector institutions have the capability to implement the sector \ndevelopment plan, and sector policies are appropriate. \n \n14.  A  community-based  approach  to  subproject  formulation,  implementation,  and  O&M \nrecently adopted by the Government should sustain the project facilities. The sector institutions \nhave considerable experience in constructing conventional water supply schemes. The sector \npolicies are generally sound. Further improvements in the sector policies have been discussed \nand agreed upon with the Government, in the context of policy dialogue (paras 54 - 58). \n \n15.  Key lessons learned from the ADB-financed WSS projects in Pakistan, particularly the \nphase I project; regional experiences; and the review of selected multilateral, bilateral, and \nNGOs-managed projects in the country, carried out during the preparation of the Project (May \u2013 \nAugust 2002) can be summarized as follows: (i) to ensure sustainability of community-based \nprojects, it is essential that both male and female community groups are involved in planning, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  O&M;  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  have  enough \ncapacity  to  assume  their  functions,  and  having  been  trained  in  the  early  stage  of  project \nimplementation; (ii) subproject selection criteria should be widely disseminated for making them \ntransparent,  avoiding  its  misinterpretation,  and  benefiting  majority  of  communities;  (iii) \ncommunity willingness to pay for services is often much higher than expected; (iv) the local \nprivate sector usually responds well to small rural WSS schemes, and is generally efficient and \ncost-effective; and construction activities should be properly packaged to capture economies of \nscale; (v) more attention must be given to gender considerations, sanitation, and hygiene \neducation components so as to achieve lasting results; (vi) start-up implementation delays \nshould  be  avoided  by  taking  advance  action  before  loan  effectiveness  -  PC-I  approval, \n     ", "5 \nestablishment of the project management unit (PMU) and the appointment of the project director \nand PMU staff, recruitment of consultants, and prequalification of contractors; (vii) advance \naction need to be taken during the execution of subprojects for the electrification of pumping \nwells to avoid delays in operationalizing the subproject after physical completion; (viii) to ensure \nquality construction and timely completion, consultants\u2019 involvement and responsibilities should \nbe enhanced and payment to contractors should be linked with consultants\u2019 verification of the \nquality of fieldwork; (ix) low salaries can result in high community development unit (CDU) staff \nturnover, which will adversely effect implementation progress and the quality of CDU activities. \nA summary of lessons learned and measures to incorporate them in the Project are in Appendix \n5.   \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives  \n \n16.  The overall goal of the Project is to reduce poverty, and improve the living conditions \nand quality of life of the communities in rural settlements in Punjab Province where water is  \nscarce and groundwater is brackish.  The project seeks to: (i) extend - through a community \nbased, demand-driven approach - water supply, drainage, and sanitation coverage to poor \nvillage communities that do not have access to organized water supply and are located in the \nbrackish and barani areas of Punjab; (ii) strengthen newly constituted TMAs and build their \ncapacity  to  organize  community-based  water  supply  and  drainage  schemes  and  improve \nrelated management functions; (iii) implement a hygiene education program including assisting \nselected beneficiaries in the project tehsils construct household latrines through a revolving \nfund; and (iv) implement a social uplift and poverty eradication (SUPER) program aimed at \nusing the time saved in fetching water in more productive and livelihood activities, particularly \nfor women, through a microcredit system, and constructing additional classrooms in schools \nwhere enrollment has increased because children were released from the chore of fetching \nwater.   \n \n17.  The Project intends to use a community-based approach to extend WSS facilities to 54 \ntehsils  in  26  districts  of  Punjab,  which  are  facing  water  scarcity  and  saline  groundwater \ncondition. The identified tehsils, mostly villages with a population of more than 1,000 and \ncomprising  about  91%  of  the  total  population  in  brakish/barani  areas,  will  receive  priority. \nHowever, any village located in the above tehsils and/or other tehsils with smaller population \nwould also be considered if the subproject is technically viable and communities accept O&M \nresponsibilities as per subproject selection criteria. Construction of about 500 new subprojects \nand rehabilitation of about 250 need-based inoperative subprojects (implemented by PHED, \nprior to the phase I project) will be included in the Project. A population of about 2.3 million will \nbe covered. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n18.  The Project comprises four components: (i) construction of water supply and drainage \nfacilities, (ii) hygiene education program, (iii) institutional strengthening and capacity building for \nlocal government institutions, and (iv) social uplift and poverty eradication program. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6   \n1.  Construction of Water Supply and Drainage Facilities \n \n19.  This component consists of the construction of simple, low-cost water supply, drainage, \nand sanitation facilities in about 500 project communities and rehabilitation of 250 need-based   \ninoperative schemes meeting the subproject selection criteria. Of the 500 new subprojects, 450 \nwill be pump-based subprojects and 50 gravity-based. Ten sites will be identified for the rain-\nharvesting subprojects.   \n \n2.  Hygiene Education Program \n \n20.  This component consists of a hygiene education program in the project villages, as \nformulated and implemented under the phase I project. Education material, service vehicles, \nand  consulting  services  will  support  the  program.  This  component  includes  establishing  a \nrevolving fund to assist selected beneficiaries in project villages to install household latrines. As \nsuccessfully implemented in the phase I project, the communities will, through male and female \nCBOs, be provided latrine components according to their choice of material, without any subsidy \nbut with payment in 2-3 easy installments to CBO. CBO will be responsible for managing the \nfund to recover the cost of latrines from the people, and will procure another batch of latrine \ncomponents as per the community demand. The community development unit (CDU) staff and \nproject consultants will give specific training to women councilors and lady health workers to \nplay a catalytic role in hygiene education and household latrine promotion. The village school \nwill be used as a hub of sanitation promotion in the community. Based on the successful \nexperience of UNICEF in Pakistan, student-parent and interchild communication techniques will \nbe used extensively to promote sanitation.5 The revolving fund to be managed jointly by male \nand female CBOs for the latrine construction program will be provided from the project imprest \naccount, which will be adjusted at the completion of the Project, as in the phase I project.  \n \n21.  All schools in the project area will be provided with latrines and connections for supply of \nsafe drinking water. The Project will monitor the effects of water quality improvements on health \nespecially child stunting, by organizing a representative sample study and project performance \nmanagement system (PPMS). \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building  \n \n22.  This component will help attain long-term sector goals by building the capacity of TMAs \nto manage the new responsibilities acquired from the provincial and federal governments after \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s devolution plan. Major interventions will include resource \nmobilization through an efficient collection of revenue, improved financial management including \nbudgeting and enhanced O&M of TMA assets; identification of the local government needs for \noffice and field equipment and extending appropriate assistance for their procurement; human \nresource development through an objectively designed training program; and establishment of a \ncomputerized  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  training  to  manage  the  human \nresources, monetary resources, raw materials, and capital resources of the TMAs in all districts \nof Punjab. Consulting services, MIS software, and education material will be provided.  This \ncomponent will be implemented in collaboration with the Government\u2019s ongoing and future \nprograms related to capacity building of TMAs and in accordance with the updated devolution \nplan.  This component also extends institutional support to the PMU in executing the Project by \nproviding (i) consulting services, (ii) equipment and service vehicles, and (iii) operational cost \nsupport for the project implementation offices on a declining basis.  \n                                                 \n5  UNICEF. 2002. Guidelines for School Sanitation in Pakistan.  \n     ", "7 \n \n4.  Social Uplift and Poverty Eradication Program \n  \n23.  Social  Uplift  and  Poverty  Eradication  Program  (SUPER)  aims  to  address  poverty \nreduction and help the poorest segments of society, particularly women and children, attain a \nbetter quality of life by productively and economically using for livelihood activities the time \npreviously used in fetching water. \n \n24.  SUPER includes two key interventions:  (i) microcredit schemes, and (ii) construction of \nadditional classrooms in the village schools to accommodate the additional children who no \nlonger need to fetch drinking water from afar. The microcredit component will comprise a variety \nof credit schemes to finance handicrafts, embroidery, carpet and rug weaving, and livestock and \npoultry etc. The Government will implement SUPER initially in 30 villages of the phase I project \nwhere the communities are already successfully operating and maintaining subprojects, and \nhave already taken some initiatives for income generation activities on a self-help basis with the \nhelp  of  their  female  CBOs  (Appendix  6).  If  successful,  SUPER  will  be  expanded  to  the \nremaining areas of phase I and the proposed Project. This initial phase will introduce the \nsubborrowers to use of group-based microfinance that will lead to linkages with the microfinance \ninstitutions6  for  continued  and  greater  access  to  microfinance  services.  The  interest  rate \ncharged will be consistent with that charged by established microfinance institutions. \n \n25.  The core component of the proposed system is a community development fund (CDF) at \neach union council (UC) level, to be managed by a UC-level SUPER committee, with a majority \nof  women  members:  women  councilors,  female  community-based  motivators  (CBMs),  and \nrepresentative of women CBOs. The CDF will have two components: the first will be a revolving \nfund for microenterprise development, and the second will be a conduit for expenditure required \nfor  classrooms  construction.  SUPER  covers  the  provision  of  financial  assistance,  a  local \ncommunity liaison advisor, and service vehicles. The funds for SUPER will be released from the \nproject imprest account. The UC-based SUPER committees will assume full responsibility for \ncontinuing SUPER after project completion. \n  \nC.  Special Features \n \n26.  The socioeconomic surveys conducted for the proposed Project and also in the phase I \nproject revealed that the household income for more than 90% of the project area is below \nPRs3,800 ($63) per month. This shows that people from the extremely poor areas of rural \nPunjab, especially women, are the main beneficiaries of these projects. The phase I project has \nalready demonstrated economic benefits and significant social development due to provision of \nsafe  drinking  water:  reduced  waterborne  diseases  and  related  expenditure,  and  improved \nhealth. With these benefits, people have more time to invest in agricultural activities and other \nincome- generating activities. In addressing the core poverty issue, it has been considered that \nthe time saved, mainly by women and children in fetching water, should be used in more \nproductive and livelihood activities that had been desperately needed during implementation of \nthe phase I project. Similarly, in villages where, due to provision of water, children have been \nfreed from the chore of fetching water, an increase in school enrollment mainly among girls was \nnoted. In many cases, additional classrooms are required. In view of this, the Government has \nagreed to include SUPER in the proposed Project as a special feature, for income generation \nthrough the microcredit system as a revolving fund, and for providing additional classrooms in \n                                                 \n6 Khushhalibank, First Microfinance Bank, and those being promoted by the proposed Rural Finance Sector \nDevelopment Program. \n ", "8   \nthe  schools.  The  microcredit  schemes  have  been  run  with  a  great  degree  of  success  in \nPakistan7  where  they  were  implemented  simultaneously  with  infrastructure  improvement \nprograms.  \n \n27.  Successful O&M of phase I project schemes by communities has resulted mainly from \nthe sense of ownership given to them for the demand-driven schemes and women's active \nparticipation  in  tariff  collection  and  social  development  works.  It  is  believed  that,  if  the \ncommunities\u2019 sense of ownership is enhanced by their share in the capital cost of the subproject \nin cash or in kind, the results will be enhanced sustainability of the schemes and a considerable \nreduction in the overall cost of the subprojects. In the consultants\u2019 survey during the preparation \nof the Project, several communities showed their willingness to share 4-20% of the capital cost \nin cash and in kind. Depending on the communities\u2019 ability to pay, various options for cost-\nsharing have been worked out by the consultants, and policy agreement with the Government \nhas been reached that all future rural WSS schemes will have the community share in the \ncapital cost in cash and/or in kind.    \n \n28.  The phase I project extended WSS facilities to the villages with a minimum population of \n1,200. The criteria have also been made flexible to encompass clusters of smaller settlements \nby including components to protect alternative sources such as lining the walls of shallow wells, \ninstalling injector pumps in small wells, introducing rainwater harvesting, and adding a drainage \ncomponent where water supply was already provided to enable the maximum number of people \nto benefit from safe drinking water and drainage facilities through the Project. Unlike the phase I \nproject, the Project will encompass rehabilitation of need-based inoperative schemes where a \nminor investment at the water source and/or extension of the distribution and drainage network \nwill activate these schemes to benefit thousands.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n29.  Based on the indicative list of 750 subprojects and other components, the total cost of \nthe Project is estimated at $71.4 million equivalent (including taxes and duties of $5.5 million), of \nwhich $13.6 million (19%) is the foreign currency cost including $1.1 million in interest charges \nduring construction, and $57.8 million equivalent (81%) is the local currency costs.  Table 1 \ngives the summary of the costs. Details are given in Appendix 7.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n30.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $50 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources, which will represent 70% of the total cost of the Project. The ADB loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  ADB  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost \ncomponent of the project in the amount of $13.6 million (including about $1.1 million interest \nduring construction), and will finance $36.4 million equivalent or 63% of  the local currency \ncost8. The local currency cost to be financed by ADB will cover portions of the civil works, \nhygiene  education  program,  SUPER,  and  the  entire  cost  of  equipment  and  material,  and \n                                                 \n7 The microcredit component of the Orangi Pilot Project, now being successfully implemented as Lodhran Pilot \nProject, in one of the project districts, has almost 100% cost  recovery. Similarly, ADB-assisted D. G. Khan Rural \nDevelopment Project is pursuing an integrated infrastructure development  and microcredit program. In both \nprojects, the microcredit component not only has resulted in multiplying the impact of infrastructure improvements, \nit has also acted as a good incentive to attract community participation. \n8  ADB will finance 66% of part A cost (51% of local currency and 100% foreign), 70% of part B, C and D. \n     ", "9 \nconsulting services, ADB\u2019s financing of the local currency expenditure is justified by the nature \nof the Project, which will address local poverty, gender, and health issues within the project \nareas. The Government will onlend the loan to Punjab on the same terms and conditions. \nPunjab  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to \nHousing, Urban Development, and Public Health Engineering Department (HUD&PHED) as \ngrant through budgetary allocation. \n \n31.  The  Government  of  Punjab  will  provide  $16.8  million  equivalent  (23.5%)  in  local \ncurrency,  and  will  cover  part  of  the  civil  works,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  other \ncounterpart funding required for project implementation. The beneficiaries will contribute about \n$4.6  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  (6.5%),  mostly  in  kind  and  labor.  The  proposed \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2.   \n \nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  \nProject Component  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n32.  Keeping in view the successful implementation of the phase I project, the provincial \nHUD&PHED will continue to be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project.  The Project will be \n ", "10  \nimplemented through a PMU, located at HUD&PHED. The PMU, headed by the project director \nand comprising professional staff, supported by a team of consultants and CDU staff, will be \nresponsible  at  the  provincial  level  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation  and \nmanagement of project activities. CDU staff recruited by HED&PHED will be supervised by the \nconsultants.  For  province-wide  implementation  of  the  Project  in  26  districts,  six  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will be established, each headed by a deputy project director \n(equivalent to executive engineer). The PIUs will be located at Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Sialkot, \nFaisalabad,  Multan,  and  Bahawalpur.  Thirteen  project  implementation  cells  (PICs)  at  the \nrepresentative tehsil headquarters, each managed by an assistant project director (equivalent to \nsubdivisional officer), will assist the PIUs in executing the Project.  \n \n33.  The Government has agreed to retain the PMU of the phase I project, including its key \ntechnical and CDU staff.  The project director was appointed before the loan negotiations. Most \nof the PMU, PIUs, and PICs will be manned by staff deputed from HUD&PHED and TMAs and \nwill return to the parent department/administrations on the completion of the Project. Some of \nthe staff will, however, be engaged on a contract basis. The implementation framework of the \nProject is presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n \n34.  Besides pump-based new and rehabilitation subprojects, the Project also includes small \nsubprojects (costing less than $0.5 million), whose implementation will be facilitated through \nlocal NGOs.  \n \n35.  For internal coordination, two committees will be set up: \n \n(i)  a subprojects implementation review committee (SIRC) at tehsil level, comprising \nmale and female representatives from TMA and UC, male and female CBOs, and \nthe PMU will look after the implementation progress of all the subprojects in a \ntehsil at monthly intervals. Headed by a tehsil head \u2013 the Nazim, the tehsil and \nUC-level women councilors are envisioned to play a key role in the SIRCs; and   \n \n(ii)  a project steering committee (PSC) \u2013 headed by the secretary  of HUD&PHED, \nwith senior officers from the departments of planning and development; finance, \nlocal government and rural development, and Water and Power Development \nAuthority (WAPDA) as members \u2013 will be set up at HUD&PHED in Lahore to \nensure smooth and orderly implementation. The secretary will also invite the \nNazims of those tehsils, where progress needs considerable improvement. A \nPSC meeting will be held at least once every 3 months.  \n \n36.  As in the phase I project, community development activities for all Project tehsils under \neach PIU will be undertaken through a team of one community development officer (CDO) and \ntwo community-based motivators (CBMs); one male and one female. HUD&PHED will appoint \none CDO at each PIU to carry out, with the help of UC and CBO, the hygiene education and \nlatrine  promotion  activities,  and  undertake  SUPER  with  the  help  of  CBOs,  UCs,  project \nconsultants, CDU staff, and NGOs.   \n \n37.  UCs and TMAs will identify the subprojects. The PMU and the TMAs/UCs jointly will \nmake a shortlist following the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 2) and extensive field visits \nby the CDU staff. The PIC and CDU staff will also assist the TMAs/UCs in identifying the \nsubprojects. Besides periodic reviews through SIRC, TMA will depute its staff to work with the \n     ", "11 \nPIC staff and the consultants during implementation and also liaise between TMA and the PMU \nto efficiently implement these tasks. \n \n38.  To update the PPMS and follow up on the completed subprojects, staff of TMA/UC \ntogether with CDU staff and the subengineer will visit the subprojects at 6-month intervals.  \nThey will provide feedback to the PIUs and the PMU for addressing any problem and for \nupdating the MIS and PPMS. TMAs will continue to engage themselves in PPMS for at least 3 \nyears after Project is completed. \n \n39.  UCs will also play a central role in managing the SUPER. Although fully involved from \nthe  very  beginning,  the  UC-based  SUPER  committees  will  assume  full  responsibility  for \ncontinuing SUPER for about 5 years after winding up the PMU at project completion. Owing to \nthe women-focused nature of SUPER, the female members of these committees will have a \nmajority.   \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n40.  The Government has kept the PMU intact, and initiated advance actions for prequalifying \ncontractors, and recruiting consultants. About 70 subprojects have already been identified and \nsurveys and technical designs of 30 subprojects have been undertaken during the preparation \nof the Project. For the counterpart fund sharing, the Government has allocated PRs200 million \nin the current financial year (2002/03). With advance actions, the Project is unlikely to face initial \nstart-up delays. Accordingly, the implementation period has been estimated as 4 years, starting \nin 2003. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Subproject Selection \n \n41.  Each  subproject  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  agreed  with  the \nGovernment (Appendix 2): (i) the subproject is primarily located in a brackish or barani area; (ii) \nthe community does not currently have an organized water supply system; (iii) the beneficiary \ncommunity is willing to form a CBO to undertake O&M of the subproject and to share its capital \ncost as reflected in Appendix 2 and a scheme-specific tariff to defray the O&M costs; (iv) PMU \nwill prepare an initial environmental examination (IEE) and, as required, an environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA); and (v) CBO will sign two memorandums of understanding (MOUs) \nsubstantially  in  line  with  the  sample  MOUs  agreed  upon  between  HUD&PHED  and  ADB \n(Appendix 2). The first MOU relates to the community\u2019s commitment to take over the subproject \nwith full responsibility for O&M; the other MOU refers to voluntary transfer of ownership of small \nparcels of land for the subproject. Implementation of any subproject estimated to cost more than \n$300,000 will require ADB's approval, to ensure the use of simple and cost-effective techniques. \nOther  subprojects  will  require  HUD&PHED's  approval,  but  ADB  will  also  review  these \nsubprojects selectively to ensure compliance with the selection criteria. HUD&PHED through the \nPMU  and  the  CBO  will  implement  the  approved  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  MOU \nbetween CBO and HUD&PHED. \n \n42.  The subproject selection criteria, which is in line with the Government\u2019s uniform policy \nframework for rural WSS sector, have been discussed with the elected representatives of the \nproject  tehsils  and  disseminated  in  the  two  stakeholder  workshops  held  during  project \npreparation. Besides tehsil representatives, the workshop participants were the officials from the \nGovernment of Punjab, aid agencies, NGOs, and project community members.   \n \n ", "12  \n \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n43.  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement  reflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents.  \n \n44.  As most of the civil works contracts are expected to be small with values of $8,000 to \n$400,000, international contractors are not likely to be interested. Therefore, all civil works \ncontracts are expected to be awarded under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB. To attract large domestic firms, the contracts will be grouped into packages, to the extent \npossible, costing $100,000 \u2013 $1,000,000 (Appendix 9). \n \n45.  All  equipment  and  materials  as  well  as  service  vehicles  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  shopping.  Certain  items  may  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Some equipment and vehicles packaged at a contract value of \nless than $50,000 will be procured under direct purchase procedures. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n46.  Overall consulting services will comprise: (i) 613 person-months of domestic consultants  \nto support project implementation; (ii) 4 person-months of  an international consultant, on an \nintermittent basis, to provide overall project management advice and supervision; and (iii)  572 \nperson-months  of  CDOs  to  undertake  community  development  activities,  HUD&PHED  will \nrecruit the CDOs as individual consultants, as done for the phase I project.  \n \n47.  The consultants will be selected as consulting firms or as individuals to be financed \nunder the Project. Firms will be selected in accordance with the quality and cost-based selection \n(QCBS) method of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and/or other arrangements \nacceptable to the ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Individual domestic consultants and \nCDU staff, and the international consultant will be recruited in accordance with the guidelines \nand selection procedures for engaging individuals.   \n \n48.  The consulting services are designed to support the Project as well as build the longer \nterm capacity of newly established local government institutions. The consultants will:  (i) assist \nin  designing  and  implementing  WSS  subprojects;  (ii)  have  expertise  in  groundwater \ninvestigations/water quality monitoring, hydrogeological studies, and construction supervision; \n(iii) strengthen and build the capacity of TMAs, UCs, and CBOs; and (iv) establish and operate a \nprovince-wide MIS and PPMS. Draft terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix \n10.  \n \n6.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n49.  To expedite implementation, the Government will take advance action on recruiting \nconsultants and prequalifying the contractors. Both provincial and federal governments have \nassured that the planning commission proforma - I (PC-I) of the Project will be approved before \nloan effectiveness. \n \n     ", "13 \n50.  Regarding the PMU, the Government of Punjab (GPb) agreed to retain the PMU of the \nphase I project and its key staff after the loan closing date of 31 August 2002 for the Project. It \nhas also assured that all phase I project vehicles, computers, printers, and other logistics will \nremain with the PMU for the proposed Project. GPb also agreed to retain the key staff of the \nCDU of phase I for undertaking the subproject preparatory activities, which include a needs \nassessment survey, identifying subprojects, and mobilizing the community and forming CBOs. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  GPb  plans  to  undertake  topographic  digitized  surveys  and \nelectrical resistivity surveys of the first 70 subprojects identified during the preparation of the \nProject. ADB approved in principle retroactive financing of $100,000 equivalent to finance the \nservices of the CDU staff and the surveys of the identified subprojects under part A of the \nProject. Retroactive financing will be limited to expenditures incurred between 6 September \n2002 and loan effectiveness. GPb has been informed that the approval of advance actions and \nretroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  expenditures  thereunder  or  the \nProject. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  For easier financial control, disbursement categories will be established by subproject \nand by expenditure type (work, goods, and services). The PMU will prepare disbursement \nprojections and request budget allocations for counterpart funds. For timely release of the loan \nproceeds, portions of the proceeds will be deposited in an imprest fund account. The GPb will \nestablish the account in the name of PHED. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the account \nwill consist of advances based on estimates of anticipated expenditure to be incurred for a 6-\nmonth period. The account will be established, operated, and maintained in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures may be \nused to reimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000, and to liquidate advances \nmade  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines.  PMU/HUD&PHED  will \ncoordinate the timely release of funds. This is essential because project activities will take place \nat different locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly \nthrough decentralized decision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures. The \nannual audit report will have a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedures. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n52.  HUD&PHED, acting through the PMU, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify works, goods, and services financed by the loan proceeds. Specifically, HUD&PHED will \n(i) maintain separate accounts for the project; (ii) ensure that project accounts and financial \nstatements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and the auditor\u2019s \nreport on them. \n \n53.  HUD&PHED/PMU will prepare monthly progress reports, in a format acceptable to ADB, \nwith  information  on  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  pre-identified \nmonitoring indicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; \n(iii) CDU activities; (iv) work done by the consultants; (v) updated results of water quality \nmonitoring and action taken on the encountered problems; (vi) progress made on PPMS; (vii) \ncompliance with the loan covenants; (viii) proposed program of activities for the next month; and \n ", "14  \n(ix) progress expected during the next 3 months. The monthly report will be submitted to ADB \nby the end of the first week of the following month. Within 3 months of the physical completion \nof the Project, HUD&PHED will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on the \nexecution of the Project including costs and compliance with the loan covenants. \n \n9.  Policy Dialogue \n \n54.  In the interest of project sustainability and enhancement of the rural WSS sector in \nPunjab, the following specific sector policy issues were agreed upon with the GPb. \n   \n55.  As in the phase I project, the WSS subprojects will be supported by ADB only if a \ncommunity-based approach, as per the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 2) are followed.  \n \n56.  Depending on affordability to the communities, various options for cost sharing were \nworked out during preparation of the Project, and policy agreement with the Government was \nreached that all future rural WSS schemes will include the community share in the capital cost, \nin cash and/or in kind.    \n \n57.  The phase I project extended WSS facilities to the villages with a minimum population of \n1,200.  In the proposed Project, the criteria were made flexible to encompass clusters of smaller \nsettlements by including components to protect alternative sources such as lining the walls of \nshallow wells, installing injector pumps on small wells, improving rainwater harvesting, and \nadding a sole drainage component where water supply was already provided to benefit the \nmaximum  number  of  people.  Unlike  the  phase  I  project,  the  Project  will  encompass \nrehabilitation of need-based inoperative schemes where minor investment at the water source \nand/or extension of the distribution and drainage network will activate these schemes to benefit \nthousands of the needy population.  \n \n58.  The  institutional  strengthening  component  of  the  Project  will  assist  tehsils  to  build \ncapacity  in  technical  operations,  sound  financial  management,  and  community-based \napproaches. It will include assistance to establish a CDU within HUD&PHED and provide CDO, \nand CBMs for all the project districts. \n \n10.  Cost Recovery and Collection Efficiency \n \n59.  GPb has also agreed that, following the successful practice in the phase I project. CBOs \nwith the assistance from the PMU will introduce subproject-specific tariff sufficient to recover \nO&M costs. Water connection for those who do not pay will be promptly disconnected with \nassistance  from  UCs,  and  community  peer  pressure  will  be  used  to  collect  tariffs  and  to \nconserve water. Similar techniques will be used to ensure timely repayments under the SUPER \nprogram. \n \n11.  Preventive Maintenance Schedule \n \n60.  HUD&PHED has agreed that the preventive maintenance schedules, already developed \nin the Urdu language in the phase I project, will be distributed to the CBOs of all the existing \nprovince-wide community-based HUD&PHED schemes. The CBOs will be trained in O&M of the \nsystem under the Project. \n \n     ", "15 \n12.  Project Performance Management System  \n61.  To ensure that subprojects are managed efficiently and that the benefits are maximized, \na benefit monitoring  and evaluation (BME) system developed in the phase I project will be \nfurther modified during project preparation, as a PPMS for the Project. This may further be \nrefined by the project consultants in coordination with TMAs/UCs and the communities during \nimplementation. Since implementation of each subproject is estimated to range from 6 months \nto 1 year, the benefits of completed subprojects will be evaluated 6 months after the completion \nof a subproject and at the same interval afterwards. PPMS reports will be prepared 6 months \nafter completion of the first subproject and submitted to ADB. HUD&PHED will also carry out a \nthird party validation of the report, through NGOs or Project consultants, before the midterm \nreview (MTR) mission, and after project completion. TMAs, being the ultimate custodians of the \nsubprojects,  will  continue  to  update  the  PPMS  and  MIS  for  at  least  3  years  after  project \ncompletion. \n \n13.  Project Review \n62.  Besides the regular performance review and evaluation carried out by the Government \nat the tehsil and provincial levels, the Project will be reviewed jointly by the HUD&PHED/PMU \nand ADB biannually to assess implementation progress. TMAs will continue to monitor and \nevaluate the implementation arrangements. Each review will recommend additional measures \nrequired to improve the implementation, and also suggest adjustments in the implementation \narrangements, if needed, particularly the staffing of the PMU, PIUs, PICs, and CDU. In addition, \na  comprehensive  MTR  will  be  carried  out  by  the  provincial  government,  concerned  tehsil \ngovernment, and ADB, after about 250 subprojects have been approved for implementation, \nand 100 are completed. The MTR will (i) critically evaluate project progress and implementation \nprocedures, procurement methodology, PPMS activities, the project consultants' performance \nand  community  participation  activities,  actual  versus  forecast  demand  of  water  for  the \nsubprojects, and capacity building of TMAs and their role in implementing the Project; and (ii) \nformulate measures to remedy identified weaknesses, to ensure successful implementation and \nachievement of the objectives. The MTR is timed to permit an opportunity to modify subproject \nselection and implementation arrangements, as a considerable portion of the loan proceeds will \nprobably not be utilized by this time.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Project Benefits  \n63.  The phase I project demonstrates ample evidence of social, environmental, health, and \neconomic  impacts,  specially  its  contribution  to  increased  household  income  and  poverty \nreduction. The community BME system, established under the phase I project, had analyzed the \nfirst 116 schemes that were handed over to the communities for O&M. The results show a \n91.5% reduction in the incidence of waterborne diseases, a 30% increase in the household \nincome, and a 94% increase in the enrollment of schoolchildren. These results were also \nverified by the consultants during the preparation of the Project.  \n \n64.  It is therefore expected that the proposed Project will generate similar integrated benefits \nwith provision of safe drinking water to improve health, and education with significant impact on \npoverty  reduction,  gender  development,  improved  environment,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment in the service area of over 2.3 million residents.  \n \n ", "16  \n  1.  Involvement of Women \n \n65.  The main project beneficiaries are women and girls who used to spend 2-5 hours daily in \nfetching water from considerable distance. The availability of water on their doorstep will not \nonly save their time, but also improve the quality of life due to improved hygienic conditions. The \nwomen will be relieved from the stress and discomfort of hauling water, specially during illness \nand extreme weathers, and they will have additional time for rest and leisure activities. They will \nbe able to divert their time and energy to more productive social and economic activities, \nincluding better child and house care, farm production activities including tending livestock and \npoultry, making handicrafts and artifacts, etc. The microcredit component of the Project will \nenable the communities, particularly women, to pursue income-generating activities. The girls, \nwho share the responsibility for water collection, will now be enrolled in schools. In the phase I \nproject, school enrollment mainly of girls doubled in several villages.   \n \n66.  To maximize benefits, women must be involved in subproject planning, design, and \nimplementation. In several subprojects in the phase I project, the female CBOs formed assisted \ntheir male counterparts in the successful O&M of the subprojects, and in social development \nworks using savings from the water tariffs. During project preparation, the consultants refined \nthe ways by which women could effectively participate in subproject planning, implementation, \nand importantly O&M. Female CBMs and the female UC councilors will help the local women\u2019s \ngroups in forming female CBOs in all subprojects. To monitor women\u2019s effective participation \nand training opportunities provided, a female assistant director for CDU, appointed on contract \nunder the Project (Appendix 6, and Supplementary Appendix 1), will work with the female CBOs \nand the female CBMs.     \n \n  2.  Poverty Reduction \n \n67.  The socioeconomic surveys for the proposed Project and also in the phase I project \nrevealed that the household income of more than 90% in the project area is below PRs3,800 \n($63) per month. Therefore, the Project will be implemented in extremely poor areas of rural \nPakistan. Summary poverty reduction and social analysis are in Appendix 11. The additional \nincome generated by households, accruing from improved health and reduction in health-related \nexpenditures, and utilizing the saved time of women in income- generating activities will reduce \nthe household poverty level. In addition, some of the households that pump out hazardous and \nunsuitable water for drinking purposes from stagnant polluted ponds will no longer spend on \nwasteful  investment  and  on  pumping.  Good  WSS  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  rural \ncommunities. Improved community health is generally reflected in lower welfare costs and more \nresources being available for community programs. As actually demonstrated in the phase I \nproject, the Project will directly address poverty reduction.  \n \n  3.  Health Benefits and Impacts \n \n68.  The expected health benefits generated by the Project are significant. The currently \nsourced water is generally unfit for human consumption and carries the risk of waterborne \ndiseases. At present the morbidity rate in areas with limited fresh water is estimated at about \n200 per 1,000, which is significantly higher than that in areas that have access to areas of fresh \ngroundwater. Similarly, poor-quality water is responsible for about 50% of infant mortality. The \npoor  quality  of  water  infested  with  waterborne  diseases  is  responsible  for  the  significant \nincidence of diarrhea and typhoid cases, both in children and adults, in the project area. This \nresults in school absenteeism in children, and loss of workdays for adults. The availability of \nclean water will create better and healthy conditions for the people and thus will enhance the \n     ", "17 \nproductivity levels of the population. The benefit monitoring surveys carried out for the phase I \nproject indicates a significant decrease in morbidity, infant mortality, and incidence of diseases \nand  the  resultant  illness  days.  The  household  sanitation  and  hygiene  education  program \ncomponent of the Project is expected to create awareness of the health benefits among the \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n  4.  IEE and SIEE \n \n69.  During the Project preparation, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried \nout  on  30  randomly  selected  subprojects.  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  adverse  or  harmful \nimpacts  of  any  significance  are  evident  and,  therefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) is not required for any subproject. A summary IEE (SIEE) is attached as \nSupplementary Appendix 2. \n \n \n5.  Impact on Minorities/Indigenous People \n \n70.  During  the  implementation  of  the  phase  I  project,  in  which  335  schemes  were \nconstructed, the political, religious, and ethnic diversity of the people within a village were \nreviewed as part of the initial need assessment survey. Detailed analysis of the available reports \nand actual field visits by the consultants during the preparation of the Project showed no \nevidence of any negative impact on the above groups mainly because of the very small size of \nthe subprojects. The minority representatives are involved in the water user committees, and all \nminority households, wherever they exist, participate in planning, execution, and O&M of the \nsubprojects without any problem, favor, or discrimination. From experience in all phase I project \nschemes, the Project is likely to have no adverse or significant impact on indigenous people. \nNevertheless, impact on indigenous people will still be properly reviewed during implementation \nby introducing performance indicators in the PPMS, at baseline and during and after project \nexecution. \n \n  6.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n71.  Small-scale WSS subprojects under the Project will consist primarily of a network of \nunderground pipelines, surface drains, and street surfacing. By their very nature these works \nwill be constructed in the public rights-of-way. Land will, however, be required in small parcels \nfor the purposes of water source development, overhead reservoir, the water transmission line, \nand wastewater disposal works. Experience in the phase I project has shown that communities \nor individuals always volunteered their land for these small facilities that benefit them directly, \nfor example community-owned unutilized land. As such no resettlement has ever been required. \nThe same was confirmed during the preparation of the Project through a study of 50 randomly \nselected villages in the phase I project. As per ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, an MOU was \nprepared (Appendix 2), that reflects written public agreement of the landowners/users to ensure \nthat the donations are really \u201cvoluntary.\u201d In case of any grievance, Government has agreed that \nthe respective UC, will address the matter.  \n \n  7.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n72.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the Handbook for \nthe Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The base case economic internal rate of \nreturns (EIRRs) for WSS works, which constitute about 85% of the total base cost of the Project, \n ", "18  \nis about 49.7%. However, adding the cost of other components to each subproject gives an \nEIRR of 43.8%. A review of schemes from the phase I project confirms that returns of this \nmagnitude can be achieved in the proposed Project as well.  Across various types of schemes \nthat were analyzed to determine the economic justification for the Project, the EIRR was 35.4- \n41.4% for the new pumping subprojects, about 70.4% for gravity-based subprojects, and about \n98%  for  the  rehabilitation  subprojects.  A  high  EIRR  with  impact  of  increased  costs  and \ndecreased benefits suggests that the project is robust and has sound economic justification.  \nThe  per  household  tariff  accounts  for  about  3-4%  of  the  low-income  household,  and  the \ncommunities have showed willingness to pay for the user charge. As the subprojects will be \nmanaged by the user groups who are obliged to recover full O&M cost as tariff, and since there \nis no utility institution involved, financial analysis was not carried out. The results of economic \nanalysis and the financial projections for the 10 representative phase I project schemes are in  \nAppendix 12. \n \n \nB.  Risk Analysis \n \n73.  Newly  established  district  governments  and  tehsil  administrations,  elected \nnational/provincial  assembly  members,  or  political  elites,  may  interfere  in  the  selection  of \nsubprojects. These risks will be mitigated by broadly disseminating and transparently applying \nthe subproject selection criteria. During implementation of the phase I project and preparation of \nthe proposed Project, the selection criteria were widely disseminated to make them transparent. \nFurther, the role and the responsibilities of consultants, as independent evaluators, have been \nenhanced. The CDU will prepare a checklist of the needs assessment survey results of each \nsubproject, which will be reviewed and verified by the consultants and submitted to ADB with \nthe monthly progress reports. Experience in the phase I project shows that the risk can be \nsuccessfully managed.  \n \n74.  Lack of adequate attention by CDU staff in forming strong CBOs and building their \ncapacities through comprehensive training, and lack of community involvement in preparing and \nexecuting subprojects, can result in unsustainable operation after handover of the subprojects. \nAfter the phase I project experience, community development techniques were improved and \nthe role of CDU was strengthened. Mandatory training for CBOs, and enhanced community \nparticipation, particularly gender involvement in project preparation, will rectify these risks.      \n \n75.  Delays in electrifying tubewells, experienced in the phase I project may prevent the \ncommunities from benefiting from the subprojects for several months even after their physical \ncompletion. Advance actions in applying for connection and timely payment to and intensive \nfollow-up with the Water and Power Development Authority, can help in avoiding this risk    \n \n76.  In  a  few  instances  in  the  past,  the  community  members  backed  out  from  their \ncommitments to taking over the subprojects for O&M. Experience with other community-based \nprojects reveals that effective community participation at an early stage and the community \ncontribution toward capital cost can greatly minimize this risk. \n \n77.  There remains the potential hazard of installing a tubewell for extracting groundwater for \nirrigation in the vicinity of the established water supply source of any subproject. That can  \nadversely effect the quality and quantity of water.  The CBOs, with the active support of TMAs, \nwill ensure that no groundwater extraction will take place in the vicinity of the water sources \ndeveloped under the Project. The CBO will guarantee this in the MOU to be signed for the \nsubproject. \n \n     ", "19 \n78.  To ensure good-quality water in all the subprojects, the PMU together with the TMAs \nstaff and CBOs will continue to monitor the water quality in all phase I project schemes and the \nProject schemes at 6-month intervals, particularly after the monsoon season. In case of any \ncontamination identified, urgent measures will be adopted to address the problem. A separate \nappendix on this will be included in the monthly progress report of the Project.  As part of the \nMIS, all these records will be kept in TMAs offices. TMAs/UCs will gradually take over from the \nPMU the responsibility of water quality monitoring and, by the completion of the Project, they will \nbe fully trained in data collection and analysis, and addressing the problems that may occur in \nthe future.  \n \nV.

General Procedure \n \n1.  Subproject  selection  will  follow  phase-I  project  practice  that  reflects  communities' \nwillingness to participate. Districts are prioritized following a formula that favors brackish and \nbarani areas. \n \n2.  Using applications for improved water supplies from communities in the project area, the \nconcerned  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  will  draw  up  priority  lists  of  subproject \ncommunities.  The  project  management  unit/housing  development  unit  and  public  health \nengineering department (PMU/HUD&PHED) will then assess the needs and demands of the \nlisted  communities  and  their  willingness  to  participate  in  development,  management,  and \nmaintenance. The PMU will refine the priority list, carry out through its community development \nunit (CDU) a series of meetings in each community on the refined list, and prepare feasibility \nstudies in consultation with the communities. Where a feasibility study meets the selection \ncriteria, HUD & PHED will seek approval of the related TMA to proceed with detailed design and \nconstruction. \n \n3.  The departmental subcommittee chaired by the Secretary, HUD & PHED will approve all \nsubprojects.  \n \nB.   Proposed Selection Criteria \n \n4.  The preparation of the list of communities requiring assistance will be based on current \npractice, to which new steps have been added to assess the willingness of the communities to \nparticipate in the Project. Three selection and screening phases have been devised to arrive at \nthe final list of about 750 schemes to be financed under the Project. \n \n  1.  Preselection of Subprojects \n \n5.  TMAs  will  list  according  to  needs  the  communities  applying  for  water  supply  and \ndrainage within the 26 districts and 54 tehsils covered by the Project, and forward the list to \nPMU/HUD&PHED. The main criteria will follow: \n \n(i)  The community must be located in a brackish or barani area. \n(ii)  The community must not have a water supply scheme. \n \n  2.  Selection of Subprojects \n \n6.   During this phase, the PMU, in consultation with each community will assess needs and \ndemands as well as willingness to accept, manage, and maintain the proposed water supply \nschemes. The main criterion for preparing the refined list will be the desire expressed by the \ncommunity for a water supply and drainage scheme and their acceptance of capital cost sharing \nand responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the scheme (including costs) upon \ncompletion. In this respect, the community-based organization (CBO) will sign a memorandum \nof  understanding  (MOU)  and  deposit  in  the  joint  bank  account  with  the  PMU  an  amount \nequivalent to an estimated 2 months O&M expenditure of the scheme, as an initial commitment.   \n \n7.  Trained CDU staff, comprising a team of one community development officer (CDO) and \ntwo  community-based  motivators  (CBMs,  one  male  and  one  female)  will  conduct  needs \n     ", "  Appendix 2  27\nassessment in each community. The actual needs and expressions of interest in the scheme \nwill be assessed through participatory socioeconomic surveys. The CDU staff will survey each \ncommunity using participatory techniques to determine, among others, population and number \nof households, household income levels, present sources of water, who collects the water, how \nmuch time is spent in collecting water, any cost associated with the present source, as well as \nresidents' willingness to pay for O&M of the scheme. \n \n8.  The CDU staff will also conduct open-ended interviews with key respondents to identify \nethnic groups and community leadership, institutions, and organizations; the community's self-\nhelp development experience; the residents' perceptions of the success or failure of the Project; \nand community\u2019s willing to assume O&M responsibility. \n \n9.  The likelihood of the scheme\u2019s success will be assessed based on the residents' ability \nand willingness to operate and manage the scheme, the level of social cohesion, and evidence \nof  a  spirit  of  self-reliance.  The  existence  of  local  organizations  that  could  undertake  the \nresponsibility, and a level of knowledge and skills related to water supply and drainage systems \nwill be positive factors in determining whether the community can be expected to be successful. \nTraining needs for scheme maintenance will be assessed and recommendations made for \ntraining the community members before and during subproject construction and subsequent \ncommissioning. \n \n10.  For a village or cluster of villages under a subproject, where a pump-based  water \nsource would be involved, the minimum population should be 1,000 (1998 census). This is \nrequired  to  ensure  that  per  household  tariff  remains  affordable  to  the  communities  as \nexperienced in the phase-I project.  \n \n11.  Regarding rehabilitation, only those schemes that have been abandoned for reasons \nsuch as nonavailability of  canal water, source failure, or completed its designed life would be \nselected.  However,  schemes  abandoned  due  to  nonpayment  of  electricity  bills  will  not  be \nconsidered unless the community pays for the arrears. Priority will be given to schemes that \nrequire minor rehabilitation or benefit a large population. PMU consultants will determine the \ncomponents of the schemes requiring rehabilitation.    \n \n12.  For gravity-based schemes and cost-effective small pump schemes, selection will be \nbased on all conditions defined in paras. 5-10. With regard to the population threshold, selection \nwill be based, not on the minimum population size but the capital cost ceiling as determined on \nthe basis of detailed analyses carried out during the preparation of the Project and reflected in \npara. 15.    \n \n  3.  Final Approval of Subprojects \n \n13.  The PMU will carry out feasibility studies, and prepare cost estimates and Planning \nCommission Proforma-Is (PC-1s) for communities for which the need assessments indicate that \nschemes built under a community-based approach are likely to be sustainable. The PMU will \nassist these communities to form CBOs, jointly plan subprojects with their CBOs, and finalize \nthe MOU with them. Final selection will be based on the findings of the feasibility studies and \ncompliance with the following criteria: \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \n(i)  Suitable technical options have been explored and the availability of sustainable \nwater source1 confirmed through adequate investigation and field tests for the \nappropriate location, required quantity, and its sustained supply of water with \nacceptable quality. \n \n(ii)  A least-cost comparison of technically feasible options has been prepared and \nthe least-cost option is selected. \n \n(iii)  The community is willing to share in the capital cost of the subproject in cash or \nin kind as per established criteria of 4-7% of the capital cost of the subproject. \nDepending on the socioeconomic profile of the villages, cost-sharing percentages \nand options to be used for the Project have been worked out during Project \npreparation based on an extensive survey of various communities. \n \n(iv)  The community is willing to accept responsibility for O&M and is willing to pay for \n100% O&M expenditures. \n \n(v)  Maps,  plans,  and  typical  sections  and  details  have  been  prepared  to  scale, \nshowing the location, scope, and scale of the subproject; and a preliminary cost \nestimate has been prepared, and CBO has signed on the agreed-upon layout. \n \n(vi)  Annual  O&M  costs  have  been  estimated  and  tariffs  to  recover  the  costs \nestablished. \n \n(vii)  Service affordability and householders' willingness to pay the established tariff \nhave been confirmed. \n \n(viii)  An implementation plan has been prepared showing the procedures for land \nacquisition, construction, and O&M. \n \n(ix)  Necessary rights-of-way, water rights, and land requirements have been, or can \nbe, acquired; and an MOU has been signed by the communities with regard to \nvoluntary transfer of land to CBO (See attachment) for the development of an \noverhead reservoir (if required), water source development, water transmission \nlines for wastewater disposal. \n \n(x)  Environmental  impacts  have  been  examined,  an  initial  environmental \nexamination or an environmental impact assessment has been prepared, and \nmitigating measures have been proposed.  \n \n14.  If  a  subproject's  feasibility  study  meets  requirements  (i)-(x),  the  relevant  authorities \n(para. 3) will approve the subproject and the PMU will proceed with design and construction of \nthe  water  supply  and  sanitation  subproject  in  consultation  with  the  local  community.  Only \nsubprojects for which land requirements have been satisfied will be included in the program. \n \n                                                 \n1 The water sources utilized will depend on the circumstances of each community. Tubewells will be constructed \nwhere good quality groundwater is available. Surface water sources, including springs, rivers, streams, and canals, \nwill be used for other communities. Typically, simple chlorination systems will be used to treat water drawn from \ntubewells, and slow sand filters will be used for surface waters. \n     ", "  Appendix 2  29\n15.  Affordability to the community and willingness to pay for its schemes\u2019 O&M costs will be \nan important factor in scheme design and service level. With the phase -I project experience, it \nwas agreed that for gravity based schemes, which are located mostly in mountainous areas and \nwhere houses spread out, stand posts and water tanks will be provided at representative \nlocations in the villages instead of household connections, to make cost-effective subprojects. In \ncase of pump subprojects, however individual household connections will be viable in terms of \ntariff collection; however, communities may opt to have the community tanks and stand posts \ninstead.  Further,  to  ensure  that  only  cost-effective  schemes  are  built  and  capital  costs  of \nsubprojects remain within certain limits, it was agreed, on the basis of extensive analysis during \nProject preparation, that the per capita capital cost of different types of schemes will not exceed \nthe following ceilings (2002 prices): \n \n(i)  New pumping water supply and sanitation (WSS) schemes   PRs2,800 \n(ii)  New, gravity based WSS and minor          PRs1,400 \nschemes assisted by NGOs \n \nC.  ADB Involvement in the Approval of Subprojects \n \n16.  The feasibility studies (including cost estimates and economic and financial justification) \nof each subproject for which the estimated total cost exceeds $300,000 equivalent will be \nforwarded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval before implementation. All other \nschemes,  provided  they  meet  the  selection  criteria,  will  be  constructed  without  prior  ADB \napproval, but the ADB's review missions will audit these schemes on a post facto basis. \n \n17.  ADB's approval must be obtained before implementing any subproject that is substituted \nfor a subproject already approved by ADB. \n \nD.   Operation and Maintenance \n \n18.  On  completion  of  the  construction  and  commissioning  phase,  the  consultants  will \nprepare a completion certificate after verifying that the subproject has been constructed as per \nagreed-upon scope and specifications and there are no shortcomings in terms of leakages or \nwater pressure at terminal points. Following the signing of this certificate by CBO and the \nrelated  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  and  project  implementation  cell  (PIC)  staff,  and  \nconfirmation of the community's satisfaction with the subproject works, the certificate will be \nissued  to  the  contractor.  During  project  implementation  and  before  handing  over  of  the \nsubproject,  the  PMU  will  train  CBOs  on  technical  and  financial  operations  and  provide \npreventive O&M manuals and a set of booklets related to budgeting and accounts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \nMEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) \nbetween \nthe Community-Based Organization (CBO) of (Name of subproject, tehsil, and district) \nand \nthe Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department of the \nGovernment of Punjab (HUD&PHED) \n \n1.

Evaluating the Capacity of Government Institutions  \n \n1.  Local governments in Pakistan lack resources and generally are manned by poor-quality \nstaff. The lists of tasks that tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) and union councils (UCs) \nare required to fulfill according to Local Government Ordinance 2001 are very long. Considering \ntheir limited capacities, the local governments cannot undertake all the tasks envisaged. To be \neffective, they need to focus on some key functions while outsourcing the rest to the private \nsector. However, the autonomy of local government tiers in appointing and dismissing of staff is \nvery limited. As all senior staff appointments are carried out by the provincial government, the \nlocal governments cannot ensure staff continuity and commitment and often find themselves \nhelpless to control the frequent transfer of qualified personnel.  \n \n1.  Current Roles and Activities  \n \n2.  The  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)-related  functions  \u2013  on  various  tiers  of  the \ndevolved departments/agencies are summarized in the following table. \n \nWSS-Related Functions on Different Tiers of Government  \n \nFor schemes exceeding PRs20 million, technical sanction has to be \nProvincial Government \nobtained from the chief engineer of PHED at provincial level. \n  Under  the  devolution  plan,  the  administrative  divisions  have  been \nPHED Monitoring and  abolished.  Hence  superintendent  engineers  at  (ex)  divisional  level \nEvaluation Units   ceased  to  exist.  At  four  locations  in  the  province,  however, \nestablishment  of  PHED  monitoring  and  evaluation  units  has  been \napproved. Each unit will be headed by a superintendent engineer \n(monitoring  and  evaluation),  with  powers  to  sanction  schemes \nbetween  PRs5million  to  20  million.  The  approved  locations  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  units  are  Multan,  Rawalpindi, \nFaisalabad, and Lahore.   \n  Under the devolved local government setup, district government does \nDistrict Government   not have a role in the WSS sector. However in the tehsil district \nheadquarters (i.e., the tehsil in which district administration is located), \nthe tehsil officer (infrastructure & services) is normally in Grade 18 as \nagainst Grade 17 technical officers, Infrastructure and Services (TOs \nI&S) in other tehsils of the same district. The TO (I&S) in TMA of tehsil \ndistrict  headquarters  plays  a  surrogate  role  of  the  (ex)  Executive \nEngineer (XEN) of PHED at district level.  \n  The TO (I&S) at district tehsil headquarters can sanction schemes up \nTehsil Government  to PRs5 million. The WSS-related responsibilities of TO (I&S) of a \ntehsil include \n\u2022  water supply  \n\u2022  control and development of water resources, other than systems \nmaintained by the union and village councils \n\u2022  sewage and sewage treatment and disposal \n\u2022  storm water drainage \n\u2022  sanitation and solid waste collection and sanitary disposal of solid, \nliquid, industrial and hospital wastes \n  Provide and maintain public sources of drinking water including \nUnion Councils  \u2022  wells, water pumps, tanks, ponds \n\u2022  other works for the supply of water \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n3.  Most of the administrative and financial management functions of the offices of the \nDepartment of Local Government and Rural Development and Department of Housing, Urban \nDevelopment and Public Health Engineering- which were providing services at the regional, \nzonal, circle, divisional, district, and tehsil levels- have been entrusted to the TMA, as the case \nmay be, along with the employees working in such offices. The current WSS-related roles and \nactivities of various tiers of government institutions are as follows: \n  \n2.  Local Government and Rural Development Department \n \n4.  District Administration. The executive district officer  (services and works) does not \nhave any district officer for WSS under him. WSS is considered a municipal function and has \nbeen  devolved  to  tehsil  level.  The  district  officer  (buildings  and  roads),  apart  from  other \nfunctions, is also responsible for water supply and sanitary works, but limited to government \nbuildings and estates. \n5.  Tehsil Municipal Administration. Tehsil Nazim is the head of the TMA. The tehsil \nmunicipal officer acts as coordinating and administrative officer in charge of the four tehsil \nofficers. The tasks allocated to tehsil officer (infrastructure and services) is to provide, manage, \noperate, maintain, and improve municipal infrastructure and services, including: \n \n(i)  water supply and control and development of water resources other than \nsystems maintained by the union and village councils; \n(ii)  sewage and sewage treatment and disposal; \n(iii)  storm water drainage; \n(iv)  sanitation and solid waste collection and sanitary disposal of solid, liquid, \nindustrial, and hospital wastes; \n(v)  roads  and  streets  other  than  roads  falling  under  the  jurisdiction  of,  and \nmaintained by, the district government or provincial government, and streets \nmaintained by the union administration or village council; \n(vi)  traffic  planning,  engineering  and  management  including  traffic  signaling \nsystem, signs on roads, street marking, parking places, transport places, \nstops, stands and terminals; \n(vii)  street lighting; \n(viii)  fire fighting; \n(ix)  parks, playgrounds, open spaces, and arboriculture;  \n(x)  slaughter houses. \n \n6.  The tehsil officer also organizes sports, cultural, recreational events, fairs, and shows; \nand cattle fairs and cattle markets. \n7.  Union Councils. The union nazim heads the union administration. The deputy union \nnazim  deputizes  the  union  nazim  during  his  temporary  absence.  The  union  secretaries \ncoordinate and facilitate community development, functioning of the union committees, and \ndelivery of municipal services under the supervision of the union nazim. \n \n8.  Where there is more than one secretary of the union administration, the distribution of \nwork among the union secretaries is as follows: \n \n(i)  The secretary for union committees is responsible for all works relating to the \ncouncil meetings and the work of all committees and any other function \nentrusted to him by the union nazim. \n     ", "  Appendix 3  35 \n(ii)  The secretary for municipal services is responsible for municipal services \nprovided  by  the  union  administration  and  carries  out  all  other  functions \nentrusted to him by the union nazim. \n(iii)  The secretary for community development is responsible for the community \ndevelopment work in the union administration, besides carrying out any other \nfunctions entrusted to him by the union nazim.  \n \n9.  Among many of the union council functions listed in the Local Government Ordinance \nare providing and maintaining public sources of drinking water, such as wells, water pumps, \ntanks, ponds, and other works for supplying water.  \n \nB.  Flow of Funds to Local Government Entities  \n \n10.  The devolution plan has decentralized administrative and financial authority to local \ngovernment institutions for governance, effective delivery of services, and transparent decision \nmaking through institutionalized participation of the people at the grassroot level.  \n \n11.  Since November 2001, under the new system, the funds (Annual Development Program \n(ADP), Khushhal Pakistan Program (KPP, federal/provincial grants) are being transferred in \ncash instead of the previous budgetary methods. The funds are transferred from the State Bank \nto the district provincial account in national banks in all the 34 districts of the province. From \ndistricts, the funds are transferred to the tehsil provincial account in the national bank of each \ntehsil.  \n12.  The allocation of development funds from the province to the districts is based on the \nlevel of underdevelopment of the districts, determined on the basis of a criterion prepared by \nPunjab  Economic  Research  Institute  (PERI).  The  funds  transferred  to  districts  include  the \nnormal ADP budget, KPP (based on federal/provincial grants for small works at local level) and \nthe federal allocation in lieu of the abolished octroi.1 \n13.  There is no criterion to allocate development funds to tehsils. The same is true about the \ntehsil-to-union council flow of funds. A provincial finance commission that was constituted is \nnow formulating proposals for this purpose. Tehsils and union councils are currently generating \nrevenues by levying certain local taxes and collecting the proceeds from transfer of property. \nThese revenues, however, are grossly inadequate to fund a comprehensive WSS program in \ntheir respective areas.  \n \nC.  WSS Policy Implementation Capability  \n \n14.  Local Government Ordinance 2001 does have a provision for intertier collaboration in \nexecuting development projects. For instance, TMAs are legally bound to provide technical \nassistance to UCs if the latter request it. For small schemes initiated/identified by the union \ncouncil, the finances are borne by the UC itself. However, because of lack of technical capacity, \nthe  union  administration  can  ask  the  tehsil  administration  to  depute  a  subengineer  for \ncosting/supervision of the scheme. If a scheme is beyond the financial capacity of the union, it \nsends  it  to  tehsil  requesting  approval  and  funding.  If  the  scheme  is  approved,  the  tehsil \nassumes the finances. At the same time, technical aspects such as site identification, costing, \ndesigning, supervision, etc. are also handled by the engineering staff of TMA. Funds are not \ntransferred to the union administration, but are spent by TMA directly. \n                                                 \n1  Octroi was a tax imposed on goods imported into the municipal limits for local use, sale, or consumption.  \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \n15.  Since  around  1990,  the  recruitment  of  graduate  engineers  through  Punjab  Public \nService  Commission  has  stopped.  During  this  period,  many  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment (PHED) engineers got promoted to higher grades, and some left the department for \nvarious reasons. The result, is a shortage of qualified Grade 17 engineers, and the void is being \nfilled by promoting technicians. Similarly many of the TOs (regulations) and TOs (finance) are \ninadequately qualified for their prescribed responsibilities.  \n16.  In most UCs, the secretaries are only secondary school graduates. Local Government \nOrdinance  2001  provides  detailed  job  descriptions  of  the  UC  secretaries.  However,  the \nfunctions given in the ordinance are too ambitious as against the present qualifications and \nexperience of the secretaries and the councilors. There are no specific job descriptions. The \nordinance describes in detail the functions and roles of different units/sections, but the local \ninstitutions have not yet prepared written job descriptions for the individual functionaries. There \nis an urgent need to do so. Many TMAs at present are in the process of preparing a new \nschedule of establishment for their institutions, but that may take several months to complete.    \n      \n17.  The staff in different tiers of local institutions came from different departments and \nservice formations, such as the local government service (LCS), LG&RDD, and PHED, and \njoined the local government tiers recently. Many of such transferred staff are still drawing \nsalaries from the parent departments. Most of the lower staff are from the defunct municipal \ncommittees/corporations. There are problems of assimilation, shortage of office space, and lack \nof coordination, often leading to polarization and clique formation. In many TMAs, the staff of the \nex-municipal  committees/corporations  form  the  major  part  of  TMA.  Staff  transferred  from \ndifferent devolved departments also create seniority problems. Some reshuffling is required to \nachieve a balance between the existing and the devolved staff. \n \n18.  The area of jurisdiction of the engineering staff of TMA is now the entire tehsil, and they \nhave to visit a large number of UCs. At present, they make visits at their own expense. This is \nnot justified, as apart from being a drain on their meager resources, it is also an inefficient and \nunproductive way of getting things done. The movement of staff remains limited and they are \nable to achieve less than what they should. Similarly at UC level, only the nazim has been \nprovided with a motorcycle. The secretaries are not (officially) mobile. If the three proposed \nsecretaries in the UC are to fulfill their functions as given in the ordinance, they must be \nprovided with one motorcycle each.      \n    \nD.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n \n1.  Structural Improvements and Staffing \n \n19.  The critical factors for the current reform process to succeed and be effective include \nhuman resource development, structural transformation, and the successful implementation of \nfiscal decentralization policies. Any local government reform process must embrace social and \ncapital investment strategies as part of the reform agenda. \n \n20.  TMAs and other tiers of local government should have the capacity to manage their \nnewly acquired powers. Capacity needs to be defined in a comprehensive sense and go beyond \ntraining to include staffing, rules, procedures, tools, incentives, promotions, and accountability. \nCapacity  growth  should  also  include  enabling  the  local  governments  to  enter  into  new \ninstitutional arrangements with the private sector and NGOs, and to expand physical capital. \nThe degree of autonomy and resources given to local governments is obviously one of the most \nimportant factors for shaping the attitudes and roles of their organs. The more autonomy a \n     ", "  Appendix 3  37 \nparticular tier of local government has and the more resourceful it is, the more service and \ndevelopment-oriented will it be. Under the present situation, various tiers of local government \nhave attained varying degrees of autonomy. Nevertheless, they lack resources to discharge the \nresponsibilities demanded of them at that level of autonomy. It is therefore important to focus on \nlocal resource mobilization.  \n \n21.  For structural improvements in the TMAs and other tiers, the project consultants will \nwork for the following proposals:   \n \n(i)  Accountability and transparency.  Lack of transparency often leads to lack of \naccountability. Thus citizens must have access to relevant information such as \nbudgets, accounts, plans, and all financial matters. Citizens must also know that \nofficials who violate the law will be punished. Consultants will help TMAs to \nreview and  compile all the above information for dissemination to the public for \nthe purpose of transparency in all financial matters. \n \n(ii)  Alliance building and coordination. The provincial government and various \ntiers  of  the  local  government  should  see  each  other  as  partners  in  the \ndevelopment  process.  Structures  that  facilitate  dialogue  between  levels  of \ngovernment should be created. This is already true in the case of the union-tehsil \nand union-district relationship, as the deputy nazim of a UC is a member of the \ntehsil council and nazim of a UC is a member of the district council. However, \nthere appears to be a void between the tehsil council and the district council. \nThere need to be associations of district nazims and tehsil nazims so that they \ncan become reliable partners on policy questions. TMAs must coordinate and \ndevelop  communication  mechanisms  among  various  local  organizations  for \ncommunity-based integrated programs and long-term partnerships and a culture \nof  collective  action  among  local  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  and  the  CBOs  so  as  to  enhance  their  organizational  capacity  for \nefficient delivery of local services. They may also establish networks that can \nprovide  a  forum  for  the  exchange  of  experiences,  ideas,  knowledge,  and \ninformation. The network will serve liaison and also articulate the perspectives \nand concerns of communities. \n \n(iii)  Capacity  building.  TMAs  need  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  including \napplication  of  the  tax  on  immovable  property,  efficient  delivery  system,  and  \nmaximum  use,  operation  and  maintenance  techniques  for  the  available \nequipment. TMAs also must be helped in improving their financial management, \nincluding budgeting, resource mobilization, and enhanced O&M of TMA assets; \nassessment of financial obligations of TMAs and appropriate improvements in \ncollecting the tax on immovable property and tapping new avenues for increasing \nthe  TMAs  revenue.  The  local  governments  should  be  well-equipped  with \ntechnological  infrastructure.  The  consultants  will  build  TMAs\u2019  capacity  to  \nmobilize resources through an efficient collection of revenue, improved financial \nmanagement including budgeting and enhanced O&M of TMA assets; identify the \nlocal government needs for office and field equipment and extend appropriate \nassistance  in  procuring  them;  human  resource  development  through  the \nadministration of an objectively designed training program. \n \n \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \n2.  Human Resource Development \n \n22.  Human resource development is concerned with people and aims at acquiring their \nservices, developing their skills, motivating them to a high level of performance, and ensuring \nthat they continue to maintain their commitment to the organization.  \n \n23.  Procurement  of  Services  (Staffing).  An  initial  review  of  the  situation,  under  the \ndevolved system, reveals that all the three tiers of government are adequately staffed (there is \noverstaffing at some places). However, there is a need to allocate proper functions and train the \nstaff in their respective function. \n \n24.  Skills Development. Keeping in view the objectives, target group, level, and course \ncontents,  Skills  development  can  be  grouped  into  two  broad  categories:  orientation  and  \nintensive training. \n \n25.  Orientation will contain information such as project background, objectives, selection \ncriteria, implementation strategy, role of stakeholders, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system \netc. The target group will be the senior-level officials/personnel like executive district officer \n(EDO), tehsil municipal officer (TMO), elected representatives, etc. The objectives of orientation \nwill be to involve the key players right at the inception stage of the project and to equip them \nwith the overall concept of the project. The orientation session will be conducted in clusters \n(grouping 3-4 tehsils).  \n \n26.  An initial training needs assessment (TNA) carried out under the PPTA reveals that \nintensive training will be required at different levels. The major focus would be at TMA level as \nTMA is the hub of all activities. In the devolved system, because of the reshuffling of staff from \nvarious ex-line departments, the concept of participatory approaches is totally new for most of \nthe staff members. Moreover, because of the transition period, the majority of the staff member \ndo  not  know  their  job  description.  The  findings  of  initial  TNA  and  project  implementation \nmechanisms suggest that training be conducted at three levels: TMA, UC, and communities. \n \n3.  Management Information System \n \n27.  A management information system (MIS) is a set of interrelated components that collect, \nmanipulate, and disseminate data and information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet \nan objective. One of the major objectives of an information system is to provide the correct \ninformation to the authorized person at the right time, at the right place, and at the right cost. \n \n28.  The proposed MIS is a computerized system to manage human resources, monetary \nresources, raw materials, and capital resources of the TMA and consists of a set of people, \nhardware, software, databases, telecommunications, and procedures that should be configured \nto collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. \n \n29.  As regards the architecture of this system, a local area network (LAN), initially consisting \nof one server machine and five terminals will be established in each participating TMA. The \nserver machine in the MIS room of TMA and five terminals\u2013 one in the office of the TMO and \none in each of the functional units of the TMA\u2013 i.e. I&S, P&C, Finance, and Regulation\u2013are all \nconnected.

The Project recognizes that participation of women in decision making is important, as \nthey are providers, users, and managers of water in the household. The woman is the best \nperson in a village household to ask about the quantity and quality of water being used. The \nProject also recognizes that communication and interaction between women is more effective \nthan between women and men, particularly in the rural areas of the Project. Therefore, the \nProject  will  actively  encourage  the  participation  of  women  as  both  beneficiaries  and \nimplementers. \n \n2.  A community development unit (CDU) was established in the phase I project. The \nGovernment has agreed to retain that CDU for the proposed Project, which will be expanded to \naddress  the  extended  need  for  social  development  activities  in  the  Project.  A  successful \nexperience in the earlier project, is the establishment of six PIUs to implement the Project. For \neach PIU, a team comprising a community development officer (CDO) and two community-\nbased motivators (CBMs, one male and one female) will be recruited. The tasks for each team \nwill include identifying subprojects through a needs assessment survey, mobilizing community, \nforming male and female community-based organizations (CBOs), undertaking an awareness \ncampaign with beneficiaries regarding the project components, and defining the role to be \nplayed at each stage of the Project by male and female groups including the male/female \nelected representatives, following up with the communities during and after implementation of \nthe  Project  to  ensure  community-based  operations  of  the  subprojects,  and  collecting  and \nanalyzing data for the project performance monitoring system. To monitor women\u2019s effective \nparticipation and training opportunities provided, a female assistant director for CDU,  appointed \non contract under the Project (Supplementary Appendix 1) will work with the female CBOs and \nthe female CBMs.     \n \n3.  During social mobilization of the selected villages, beneficiary communities will be shown \nthe  importance  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  village  meetings,  and  in  all  phases  of  project \nplanning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  also  the \nexecution of other components: hygiene education, household latrine construction, and the \nsocial  uplift  and  poverty  eradication  programs.  The  following  targets  will  be  achieved  in \nimplementing the Project: \n \n(i)  For each PIU, a team comprising a CDO and two CBMs; one male and one \nfemale, will be recruited \n(ii)  To monitor women\u2019s effective participation and training opportunities provided,  a \nfemale assistant director for the CDU appointed on contract will work with the \nfemale CBOs and the female CBMs.     \n(iii)  Both  PIU  and  CDU  will  emphasize  the  need  for  active  participation  of \nbeneficiaries in community meetings, which will have 50% women\u2019s participation; \n(iv)  Women councilors of union councils (UCs) and female CBOs will participate in \nsubproject planning, design, execution, and O&M. \n(v)  A  subproject  implementation  review  committee,  to  be  established  under  the \nProject, will include women councilors of UCs and tehsils, and female CBOs as \nkey members of the community; \n(vi)  Female CBOs and UC-level female councilors and lady health workers will play \nan active role in implementing the hygiene education and latrine construction \nprogram. In this connection, the CDU staff and the project consultants will give \nspecific training to women councilors, lady health workers, and female CBOs. \n ", "4 4   Appendix 6   \nThe revolving fund for latrine construction will be managed jointly by the male \nand female CBOs. \n(vii)  The UC-level social uplift and poverty eradication program (SUPER) committee \nwill include female councilors and female CBOs for executing SUPER in the \nselected project villages. Of the target beneficiaries of microcredit, wherever \nfeasible, 60% will be women, especially the poor women of the community. \n \n4.  The PMU, CDU, and the project consultants will be responsible for developing and \nimplementing the appropriate strategies and action plans for the above tasks, using mandatory \nparticipatory approaches.

General \n \n1.  This  Appendix  presents  the  detailed  economic  justification  for  community-operated \nsmall-scale water supply and sanitation investment in the saline groundwater areas of Punjab \nprovince.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis \nof Projects, and the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Economic \nanalysis carried out on 10 typical representative water supply and sanitation schemes. Six  \nschemes represent pumping schemes, and two each represent gravity-based schemes, and \nrehabilitation schemes. The Project envisages construction of 750 schemes - 500 new pumping \nand  gravity-based  schemes  and  250  rehabilitation  schemes.  As  this  is  an  indicative \napportionment, the actual configuration will depend on the demand by the communities for \nvarious types and size of schemes. Nonetheless, based on the most likely configuration, the \neconomic analysis has been carried out for (i) all the 10 schemes, and (ii) for the Project as a \nwhole. The analysis includes estimation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), average \nincremental financial cost (AIFC), average incremental economic cost (AIEC), switching values, \nand poverty impact ratio (PIR).  The assumptions used in the analysis are in Section B. \n \n2.  As per Government policy, only those communities that would undertake responsibility \nfor the full cost of operating and maintaining the schemes will qualify for the Project. Due to \nlimited availability of fresh water from alternate sources, the schemes under this Project will be \ndesigned mainly to replace the existing water availability with safe water, with some provision \nfor incremental water deliveries, arising from both increase in demand due to population growth \nand induced water demand. For such schemes, the relevant per household tariff is based on the \nactual expenditure incurred on operation and maintenance (O&M) of the scheme. There will be \nno metering, and the water supply will be rationed at fixed delivery hours for each household. \nThere will not be any quantity-based progressive tariff structure, and each household will be \ncharged a fixed monthly tariff.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n3.  The economic rationale behind the investment in the provision of water supply and \nsanitation scheme is in line with the poverty reduction objectives of the Government and ADB. \nThe communities that have poor access to safe drinking water are mostly poor and do not have \nthe capacity to invest in the infrastructure. Moreover, most of them are in small settlements with \nthe water source at considerable distance, requiring a large investment, beyond their capacity. \nHowever,  the  phase  I  project  has  demonstrated  that  the  beneficiaries  generally  have  the \ncapacity and are willing to pay for the O&M cost of the schemes. In most communities, the \nbeneficiaries have shown their inclination to contribute a modest share of the capital cost in kind \nand in cash.  \n \n1.  Assumptions \n(i)  All cash inflows and outflows are priced in 2002 prices. \n(ii)  Only incremental costs and revenues have been accounted for. \n(iii)  Though the project implementation period is 4 years, it is assumed that each \nscheme will be identified, designed, and constructed, within 1 year. \n     ", "                      Appendix 12  55\n(iv)  Each scheme will have an economic life of 20 years, with no residual value at the \nend of the 20th year. \n(v)  Pump and machinery will be replaced in the 16th year at a cost equivalent to that \nof the year of construction. \n(vi)  The real opportunity cost of capital is 12% per annum. \n(vii)  The annual production/delivery has been designed at around 40 liters per capita \nper day, with no provision for unaccounted-for water due to leakages. \n(viii)  The  house  will  not  be  metered,  so  no  allowance  has  been  kept  for  illegal \ndiversions or free riders. \n(ix)  The economic analysis is based on adjusting the financial prices net of taxes and \nduties. \n(x)  Base costs has been used for pricing inputs. \n(xi)  A  separate  provision  has  been  made  for  price  contingencies  and  physical \ncontingencies, where applicable. \n(xii)  PRs60.00 is equivalent to $1.   \n(xiii)  The standard conversion factor (SCF) is 0.9. \n(xiv)  The average daily wage rate is PRs150 for skilled labor, PRs100 for unskilled \nlabor, and PRs60 for women. \n(xv)  The shadow wage rate is 1.1 for skilled labor, 0.8 for unskilled labor, and 0.7 for \nfemale workers (to reflect their opportunity cost). \n(xvi)  The population will increase at 2.5% annually. \n(xvii)  A surcharge of 5% is added to the tariff to allow for replacement costs and \nemergencies. \n(xviii)  Women spend on average 3 hours in fetching water, and 50% of their time is \nspent in income generating activities. \n(xix)  About 25% adjustment is made on the price of pump and machinery to reflect \neconomic prices (to reflect taxes and duties on the imported components). \n(xx)  Similarly,  a  25%  adjustment  is  made  on  the  material  costs  (such  as  pipes, \ncement  etc.)  to  reflect  economic  value  (to  reflect  taxes  and  duties  on  the \nimported components). \n(xxi)  About 20% adjustment on the electricity cost will represent economic value. \n(xxii)  The opportunity cost of water in alternate uses is zero. \n \n2.  Estimation of EIRR \n \n4.  The cost estimate for the representative schemes is based on schemes similar, in size \nand service area coverage implemented during the phase I project. The estimation of the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is based on the standard cost estimates, both capital \ncost and operating and maintenance cost, and derivation and valuation of quantifiable benefits. \n \n3.  Project Benefits \n5.  The proposed project will benefit an estimated population of about 2.3 million, increasing \nto about 3.2 million in 20 years. The main benefit is the economic value of the time saved by \nwomen and diverted to activities that will contribute to the socioeconomic well-being of the \nhousehold. The experience from the phase I project suggests that the resultant time saving \nsignificantly  reduces  the  stress  on  women  and  girls.  With  water  supply  on  the  door-step, \nwomen\u2019s contribution to farm-related activities, tending live stock, and other off-farm income- \ngenerating  activities  has  considerably  increased.  Moreover,  women  have  more  time  for \nhousehold chorus and better child care. Girls who used to share the burden of fetching water \nare now able to attend school regularly.  \n ", "56     Appendix 12 \n  \n6.  In  addition,  there  are  significant  nonquantifiable  benefits,  especially  health-related \nbenefits. Access to clean water has significantly reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases \nand other illnesses, and the resultant productivity loss due to absenteeism from work. These \nbenefits are difficult to quantify and have been excluded in estimating the EIRR. Similarly, \nbenefits, such as elimination of stagnant ponds that served as breeding places for mosquitoes, \nalso have not been accounted for in the economic analysis. \n \n7.  The economic analysis is based on the traditional with- and without-project approach. \nThe main benefits that have been quantified are value of time saved in collecting water; saved \nvendor cost; and value of capital and O&M cost saved. The last two represent private cost that \nsome households incurred in maintaining partial supplies from existing sources.   \n \n8.  The value of time saved in collecting water is estimated as the value of the average time \nspent by women in collecting/fetching water. For collecting/fetching water, women on average \nspend 3 hours a day. The normal wage for women is about PRs60 per day. Assuming 50% of \nthe available time is used in productive employment, and applying a shadow wage rate of 0.7, \nthe value of time saved in a year is estimated as PRs2,874.  \n \n9.  The benefits also take into account the cost that households in the without-project \nsituation would have incurred. This includes savings from capital and O&M cost of the motorized \nor hand pumps. \n  \n4.  Estimated Parameters  \n10.  Table A12.1 presents a summary of the AIFC, AEIC, monthly tariff per household, \nestimated proportion of monthly tariff in household income, EIRR, and PIR for each scheme, \nand the average for the 10 schemes.  AIFC for water supply and sanitation projects provides a \nmeasure of the cost per cubic meter of the proposed subprojects and the tariff needed to \nprovide  full  cost  recovery.  AIEC  is  the  discounted  value  of  incremental  capital  costs  and \noperating costs (in economic prices) over the project life, divided by the discounted value of the \nincremental quantity of water sales. \n \n11.  The average EIRR for the 10 schemes is estimated as 49.7%. For individual schemes \nthe EIRR ranges between 20.3% and 110.7%. Across the schemes, the EIRR estimates vary as  \na function of scheme size, distance of source from the settlement, population, and household \nsize. The EIRRs are higher than the estimates for similar schemes in the phase I project and \nsimilar projects elsewhere. However, the previous project has given enough experience to \ndesign cost-effective schemes with higher returns for the proposed schemes than for schemes \nelsewhere with similar water deliveries.  \n \n12.  Table A12.2 presents the EIRR for the project as a whole, including the management \ncosts and other noncivil work components. The estimated EIRR for the proposed Project as a \nwhole is about 43.8%. The figure is conservative, as it does not include benefits derived from \nsanitation improvements and health benefits. \n \n5.  Sensitivity Analysis and Switching Values  \n13.  The sensitivity analysis of the 10 schemes is presented in Table A12.3. The schemes \nare generally robust and insensitive to changes in the cost of civil works. On average, the \n     ", "                      Appendix 12  57\nschemes (except for one) can absorb more than 50% increase in capital cost. Even if the costs \nincrease by about 175%, the EIRR is still about 12%. The switching values represent the \npercentage  change  in  costs  and  benefits  that  would  set  the  EIRR  at  12%,  for  individual \nschemes, as well as for the average of 10 schemes. \n \n14.  The sensitivity analysis of the whole Project is presented in Table A12.4. The Project is \nrobust and insensitive to increase in costs. It can absorb more than 50% increase in costs and \n50% decrease in benefits. The Project is also viable even if there is a simultaneous 50% \nincrease in costs and 50% decrease in benefits.  \n \n6.  Distribution of Economic Benefits and Poverty Impact Analysis \n15.  The  Project  will  benefit  all  segments  of  society.  The  main  beneficiaries  are  the \nconsumers,  especially  women.  The  investment  will  also  benefit  the  construction  industry, \nespecially rural labor. It is estimated that the Project will provide employment of about 130,000 \nperson-months to construction labor. A few laborers who are working as water vendors may \nlose their job. However, they will be absorbed in the alternate opportunities out of demand for \nadditional labor for construction. Since the Project will not generate taxes, the public sector will \nnot be able to recover the investment. \n \n16.    The PIR estimates the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor, and the flow of \ngovernment expenditure to the poor segment of the society. In estimating the benefits accruing \nto the poor, it is assumed that more than 90% of the beneficiaries and the construction laborers \nin the proposed Project are poor. \n \n17.    The poverty impact analysis for each of the 10 schemes is in Table A12.1. A PIR of \nabout 0.67 shows that the poor will benefit both as consumers and as wage earners from the \nProject activity. \n \nC.   Financial Analysis \n18.   The financial analysis is limited to estimation of the AIFC, and analysis of affordability by \nconsumers. Since the water supply and sanitation schemes will be operated and managed by \nthe users themselves, no utility institution is involved.  \n \n1.  Average Incremental Financial Costs  \n \n19.   The AIFC is the ratio of the discounted costs (both capital and O&M) of measurable \naddition to the capacity divided by the total discounted water delivered in cubic meters (cum) \nover its expected life.  AIFC, as incidence per household, has been estimated separately for \ncapital and O&M costs, and combined costs, to compare with the actual tariff. Table A12.1 \npresents AIFC and AIEC for selected schemes as well as on overall basis. \n \n20.   AIFC has been estimated for each scheme in terms of incidence per household to \nassess affordability. The average monthly per household tariff is about PRs72. For individual \nschemes, it ranges between PRs10 and PRs125. Gravity-based schemes have the lowest tariff. \nAIFC, as expected, generally is inversely correlated with population. The average AIFC is about \nPRs6.3 per cum. It ranges between PRs1.4 and PRs16.4. The AIEC is lower than the AIFC, as \nthe economic cost for most goods and services is lower than the financial costs. \n ", "58     Appendix 12 \n \n2.  Affordability \n  \n21.    The communities generally are aware of the Government policy that, to qualify for the \nschemes, they will have to assume the responsibility for postcompletion O&M. They will request \nassistance if they feel that the value of piped water exceeds the O&M cost. The experience from \nthe phase I project suggests that almost 98% of the beneficiaries are willing to pay and can \nafford the tariff. Although reliable data on income is not available, it is estimated that the \naverage tariff for low-income beneficiaries is about 2.3% of their household income, ranging \nbetween 0.4% and 3.4%. \n \n22.    Although  communities  will  be  contributing  a  minimum  of  2% toward the capital cost, \nmostly in kind, some communities have indicated that they are  willing to  share up to 20% of the \ncapital cost. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     ", "                      Appendix 12  59\nTable A12.1: Population, Number of Households, AIFC, AIEC, Monthly Tariff, EIRR, and \nPIR of 10 Selected Schemes \nTariff As \nPercentage \nMonthly  of Monthly \nTariff Per  Income of  Poverty \nNumber of  AIFC  AIEC  Household Poor  Base Case  Impact \nScheme  Population Households  (PRs)  (PRs)  (PRs)  Household  EIRR (%) Ratio \nP-1         5,211            918           8.11           6.18              59   2.39  50.40          0.67  \nP-2         2,307            435         14.91         11.36            101   4.40  30.07          0.74  \nP-3         1,611            260         16.17         12.32            127   4.76  20.25          0.66  \nP-4         4,240            621           5.72           4.36              50   1.69  49.56          0.66  \nP-5         1,845            249         13.29         10.12            125   3.89  33.72          0.70  \nP-6         2,324            402           8.83           6.73              64   2.56  52.77          0.67  \nG-1         2,056            364           1.35           1.03              10   0.39  92.42          0.65  \nG-2         2,101            262           1.62           1.23              13   0.37  73.62          0.63  \nR-1         2,107            319         11.22           8.55              95   3.32  79.18          0.66  \nR-2         3,131            476           6.64           5.06              56   1.96  110.66          0.64  \nAverage           2,682            426           6.29           6.91              72   2.65  49.65          0.67  \nNote: P-1 to P-6 are pump-based schemes, G-1 to G-2 gravity-based, and R-1 to R-2 are rehabilitation schemes \n \nTable A12.2: EIRR of the Project As a Whole (PRs million) \nConstruction  Other  Total \nYear  Cost   Project Costs O&M Cost  Total Cost  Benefits  Cash Flow \n  1             533.1   210.7                -
