An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nis  a \n\nthe  summary \n\nIEE \n\nundertaken,  and \nsupplementary appendix. \n\nThe  Project,  developed  as  a  sector  loan  under  the  overall \nframework  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan's  poverty  reduction \nstrategy  outlined  in  its  10-Year  Perspective  Development  Plan \n2001-2011,  will  provide  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS) \nfacilities to about 2,500 rural communities in Punjab Province that \nhave  brackish  groundwater  or  where  water  is  scarce  and  rainfall \nseasonal. It will also facilitate building the institutional capacity of \nnewly  established  local  government  institutions  and  improving \ncommunities\u2019  health  and  hygiene.  The  Project  includes  a  social \nuplift  and  poverty  eradication  program,  which  will  address  core \npoverty  issues  by  providing  income-generating  opportunities  to \ncommunities  together  with  the  education  benefits  linked  with  the \nprovision of WSS facilities. \n \nIt follows the successful implementation of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)-assisted phase I project1 which successfully achieved \nits  development  objectives  particularly,  poverty  reduction,  gender \nand development, and environmental improvement.  \n \n\nPunjab  is  the  country\u2019s  largest  province  with  a  population  of \napproximately  84  million,  or  around  62%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  of \n135  million.  About  60%  of  the  Punjab's  population  live  in  rural \nsettlements,  and  36%  are  classified  as  poor.  The  overall  water \nsupply  coverage  in  rural  Punjab  is  53%;  about  half  of  that  is \nprovided by piped systems and the rest through community hand \npumps.  The  remaining  47%  of  households  rely  on  often  distantly \nlocated sources of unsafe water, such as uncovered wells, rivers, \nand rain-fed or canal-fed ponds.  Similarly, only about 27% of the \nrural  population  has  access  to  sanitation  facilities  in  the  form  of \nhousehold latrines.  About half of the villages are located in areas \nof brackish, polluted, or scarce water. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.1995.

The loan was closed on 31 May \n2002. Loan accounts are scheduled to be closed on 31 December 2002. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\nits  poverty \n\nthe  Government \n\nlack  of  capacity  of  recently  established \n\nLack  of  water  impacts  on  the  lowest  income  groups,  especially \nwomen and children who spend much time in fetching water. This \ntask  causes  the  women  to  lose  out  on  productive  opportunities \nwhile children lose out on educational opportunities. These groups \nalso suffer significantly from water-borne diseases due to the use \nof  water  unfit  for  human  consumption  and  from  the  high  cost  of \nheath care due to illness. The provision of clean water will enable \nthese beneficiaries to make more productive use of their time and \nwill yield significant health benefits.    \n \nUnder \nis \nreduction  strategy, \ncommitted  to  meeting  the  demand  of  the  village  communities \nthrough  its  own  resources  and  by  utilizing  the  financial  and \ntechnical \nresources  of  various  external  support  agencies. \nHowever, the completion of the multidonor-supported social action \nprogram, which included rural WSS as one of its components, has \ngrossly handicapped the Government in meeting its commitment. \nIn  addition, \nlocal \ngovernment  institutions  to  provide  and  manage  adequate  WSS \nfacilities,  and  lack  of  resources  to  yield  adequate  economic \nbenefits  to  communities  are  major  constraints  faced  by  the \nGovernment.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  to  reduce \npoverty by building on the phase I project experiences to construct \ncost-effective WSS subprojects for about 2,500 villages, involving \nimplementing \nin  planning,  designing,  and \ncommunities \nsubprojects;  build  the  capacity  of  participating  tehsil  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs);  and  through  the  complementary  social \nuplift and poverty eradication  program, yield economic benefits to \npoor communities. The project beneficiaries have been estimated \nto be about 2.3 million.  \n \nThe overall goal is to reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand  the  quality  of  life  of  the  communities  in  rural  settlements  in \nPunjab  province  where  water  is  scarce  and  groundwater  is \nbrackish.  The objectives are to (i) extend water supply, drainage, \nand  sanitation  coverage  to  poor  village  communities  that  do  not \nhave  access  to  organized  water  supply  and  are  located  in  the \nbrackish  and  barani  areas  of  Punjab,  using  a  community-based, \ndemand-driven approach; (ii) strengthen and build the capacity of \nnewly  constituted  TMAs  to  organize  community-based  water \nsupply  and  drainage  development  and  improve  other  related \nmanagement  functions;  (iii)  implement  a  hygiene  education \nprogram  including  assistance  to  selected  beneficiaries  in  the \nlatrines  using  a \nproject \nrevolving  fund;  and  (iv)  implement  a  social  uplift  and  poverty \neradication program aimed at using the time saved by women and \nchildren  from  fetching  water    to    more    productive  livelihood \nactivities  through  a  microcredit  system  and    construct  additional  \nclassrooms  in  schools  where  enrollment  has  increased  when \nchildren were freed from the task of fetching water.   \n\nfor  constructing  household \n\ntehsils \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nCurrently,  54  tehsils  of  26  districts    (out  of  a  total  34  districts) \nwhere  significant  water  scarcity  or  brackish  groundwater  exists \nhave  been  selected  for  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  cover \nother  tehsils  where  villages  with  similar  conditions  are  identified \nduring  the  execution  of  the  Project.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  \non  the  basis  of  criteria  (Appendix  -  2),  to  be  implemented  with \nactive participation of both male and female groups. \n\n \n\nThe Project consists of four parts: \n \nPart A \u2013 Construction of water supply and drainage facilities. \nConstruction  of  about  500  community-based  simple,  low-cost \nwater  supply  and  drainage    subprojects,    and  rehabilitation  of  \nabout  250      need-based  inoperative  old  subprojects,  meeting  the \nsub-project  selection  criteria.    The  new    subprojects  will  include \nabout 450 pump-based schemes, and 50 gravity-based schemes. \nAt least 10 sites will be identified for the rain-harvesting schemes.  \n\n \n\nfund \n\nPart  B  \u2013  Hygiene  education  program.  Carrying  out  a  hygiene \neducation program as formulated and implemented in the phase I \nproject.  Education  material,  service  vehicles,  and  consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  support  the  program.  This  part  also \nincludes  establishing  a \nto  assist  selected \nrevolving \nbeneficiaries  in  project  villages  to  install  household  latrines.  All \nschools  in  the  project  area  will  be  provided  adequate  supply  of \nsafe drinking water and latrines. \n \nPart  C  \u2013  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Building. \nStrengthening  and  building  the  capacity  of  the  local  government \ninstitutions  including  TMAs  in  all  districts  of  Punjab  by  providing \nconsulting  services,  management \ninformation  system  (MIS) \nsoftware,  and  education  material.  The  project  management  unit \n(PMU)  of  the  Housing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Health \nEngineering Department (HUD&PHED) will be provided consulting \nservices,  equipment,  service  vehicles,  and  operational  cost \nsupport  for  the  community  development  unit  (CDU)  and  project \nimplementation offices.  \n \nPart  D  -  Social  Uplift  and  Poverty  Eradication  Program \n(SUPER).  Two  key  interventions  are  (i)  microcredit  schemes  for \nusing  the  time  saved,  mainly  by  women  and  children,  in  more \nproductive and livelihood activities; and (ii) constructing additional \nclassrooms  in  the  village  schools  where  existing  space  is  not \nenough to accommodate additional children who have been freed \nfrom  the  chore  of  fetching  drinking  water.  SUPER  covers  the \nprovision  of  financial  assistance,  a  local  community  liaison \nadvisor,  and  service  vehicles,  initially  in  the  selected  phase  I \nproject communities and later, based on success, to the remaining \nareas of phase I project and the proposed Project. This phase will \nintroduce  subborrowers  to  group-based  microfinance, which will\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \n\nlead  to  linkages  with  the  microfinance  institutions  and  greater \naccess to microfinance services. The interest rate charged will be \nconsistent with those of the established microfinance institutions. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $71.4  million \nequivalent, of which $13.6 million is the foreign currency cost, and \n$57.8 million equivalent is the local currency.   \n \n\n \n \nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n\n \nForeign \nExchange \n13.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n13.6 \n\n \nLocal \nCurrency \n36.4 \n16.8 \n4.6 \n57.8 \n\n \n \nTotal \n\n50.0 \n16.8 \n4.6 \n  71.4 \n\n(million) \n\n \nPercentage \n70.0 \n23.5 \n6.5 \n100.0 \n\n \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  37,885,000  ($50  million \nequivalent) from the Asian Development Fund. The loan will have \na term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest \nrate  charge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n \nADB  will  provide  the  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, \nwhich  will  relend  it  to  the  Government  of  Punjab  on  the  same \nterms and conditions. The foreign exchange risk will, however, be \nborne  by  the  Government  of  Punjab,  which  will  make  the  loan \nproceeds  available  to  HUD&PHED  as  a  grant  through  budgetary \nallocation.   \n \nUntil 30 June 2007 \n \n \n31 December 2006 \n \nKeeping in view the successful experience in the phase I project, \nthe  Project  will  be  implemented  through  the  existing  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU),  located  at  the  provincial  HUD&PHED. \nThe  appointed  project  director,  project  implementation  units  \nin  six  representative  districts,  and  project \n(PIUs)  set  up \nimplementation  cells  (PICs)  at  13 \ntehsil  headquarters  will \ncoordinate,  manage,  and  implement  the  project  activities.  Union \ncouncils (UCs) and TMAs will identify subprojects in coordination \nwith  the  CDU  staff  of  the  Project.  On  the  basis  of  the  extensive \nfield  visits,  the  PMU  and  the  TMAs/UCs  jointly  will  shortlist  the \nsubprojects. \n \nHUD&PHED of Punjab \n \n\n \n\n\fProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nvii\n\nfinancing  of  $100,000 \n\nAll  procurement  financed  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines for Procurement  reflecting \nADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s standard \nbidding  documents.  Because  most  of  the  civil  and  mechanical \nworks are small and are unlikely to attract international firms, they \nwill  be  carried  out  using  local  competitive  bidding  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. To expedite implementation of the Project, the \nGovernment  will  retain  the  PMU  of  the  phase  I  project  and  take \nin  recruiting  consultants  and  prequalifying \nadvance  action \ncontractors.  On  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  approved \nretroactive \nfor  undertaking  advance  \ntechnical surveys of the identified subprojects. \n \nOverall consulting services will include (i) 613 person-months from \ndomestic  consultants  to  support  project  implementation;  (ii)  4 \nperson-months from an international consultant, on an intermittent \nto  provide  overall  project  management  advice  and \nbasis, \nfrom  domestic \nsupervision;  and \ncommunity  development  officers \nfor  undertaking \ncommunity  development  activities.    All  the  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to \nADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n\n(iii)  572  person-months \n(CDOs) \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  organized  WSS  facilities  to  about  2,500 \nvillage  communities  located  in  areas  of  acute  water  scarcity  or \nwhere groundwater is brackish and unfit for human consumption. \nThe socioeconomic surveys for the Project and also in the phase I \nproject revealed that household income for more than 90% of the \nproject  area  is  below  PRs3,800  ($63)  per  month.  Therefore,  the \nProject  will  be  implemented  in  extremely  poor  areas  of  rural \nPunjab. An estimated 2.3 million will directly benefit from the WSS \nsubprojects.    The  main  benefit  is  the  economic  value  of  the  time \nsaved  by  women  in  fetching  water  and  diverted  to  activities \nleading  to  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the  household.  The \nexperience  from  the  phase  I  project  suggests  that  the  resultant \ntime  saving  has  significantly  reduced  the  stress  on  women  and \ngirls.  With  water  supply  on  their  doorstep,  women  can  contribute \ntheir  labor  input  in  farm-related  activities,  tend  livestock,  and \npursue  other  off-farm  income-generating  activities.  Moreover, \nwomen  have  more  time  for  household  chores  and  better  child \ncare.  Girls  who  used  to  share  the  burden  of  fetching  water  and \nthus  miss  school  are  now  able  to  attend  school  regularly.  These \nactivities have significant social and economic benefits. \n \nIn  addition,  there  are  significant  health-related  benefits.  The \ndecreased morbidity rates and infant mortality are visible benefits. \nThe   access  to   clean  water  has   significantly    reduced    the  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases  and  other  illnesses,  and  the \nresultant  productivity  loss  due  to  absenteeism  in  the  workplace. \nSimilarly, elimination of stagnant ponds, which served as breeding \nthe \nplace \nfor  mosquitoes,  and  cleaner  streets  due \ncomplementary  improved  drainage  investment  have  contributed \nconsiderably to environmental improvement.   \n\nto \n\nStrengthening  the  TMAs  will  build  their  capacity  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  the  subprojects  and  enable  them  to  implement \nsimilar  subprojects  in  the  future  in  an  ongoing  manner.  This  will \nsubstantially accelerate the achievement of the sector goals.  \n  \nImplementation  of  the  Project  will  result  in  substantial  savings  in \ntime  and  a  reduced  health  burden,  and  rural  women  will  be  the \nmain  beneficiaries.  Through  its  SUPER  program,  the  Project  will \naim  at  boosting  village  economies  by  using  time  savings  of \nwomen  and  children  in  productive  and  livelihood  activities.  It  will \nalso result in manifold increases in school enrollment, particularly \nof girls, as experienced in the phase I project.   \n \nThe  phase  I  project  experience  allows  a  reasonably  accurate \nassessment  of  the  project  risks  and  advance  provision  of \nsafeguards. \n \nAssumptions  used  in  project  design  and  feasibility  are  based  on \nthe  biannual  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  of  the \nphase  I  project,  which  was  also  independently  verified  by  the \nconsultants during preparation of the Project. A description of the \nanticipated risks and proposed safeguards follows. \n \nThere  is  a  possibility  of  political  interference  in  subproject \nselection  by  the  newly  installed  local  governments,  elected \nnational/provincial assembly members, or political elites. The risks \nwill  be  mitigated  by  broadly  disseminating  and  transparently \napplying  the  subproject  selection  criteria.  During  implementation \nof the phase I project and the preparation of the proposed Project, \nthe  criteria  had  been  widely  disseminated  to  make  selection \ntransparent.  Further, \nresponsibilities  of \nconsultants,  as  independent  evaluators,  have  been  enhanced. \nThe  results  of  the  needs  assessment  survey  for  each  subproject \nwill  be  prepared  by  the  CDU  staff;  they  will  be  reviewed  and \nverified by the consultants and submitted to ADB with the monthly \nprogress report. \n \nLack  of  adequate  attention  by  CDU  staff  in  forming  strong \ncommunity-based  organizations \ntheir \ncapacities through comprehensive training, and lack of community \ninvolvement  in  preparing  and  executing  the  subproject  can  result \nin  unsustainable  operation  after  the  handover  of  the  subprojects. \nFrom  the  phase I  project   experience, community  development \n\n(CBOs)  and  building \n\nrole  and \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nix\n\ntechniques  have  been  improved  and  the  role  of  CDU  has  been \nstrengthened. Mandatory training for CBOs, and enhancement of \ncommunity participation, particularly gender involvement in project \npreparation, will rectify these risks.     \n \nIn  a  few  instances  in  the  past,  the  community  members    backed  \nout    of  their  commitments  to  taking  over  the  subprojects  for \noperation  and  maintenance.  Experience  with  other  community-\nbased projects reveals that effective community participation at an \nearly  stage  and  the  community  contribution  toward  capital  cost \ncan greatly minimize this risk. \n \n \nThere  remains  the  potential  hazard  of  installing  a  tubewell  for \nextracting  groundwater  for  irrigation  use  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nestablished  water  supply  source  of  any  subproject  which  can  \nadversely effect the quality and quantity of water.

The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\n2. \nThe Government is concerned about the low levels of social services, particularly in rural \nareas,  and  believes  that  greater  investment  in  basic  social  services  will  accelerate  gains  in \nproductivity,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  smaller,  healthier,  and  better  educated  families. \nNationally,  the Government  has identified low water supply and sanitation coverage as one of \nthe  major  issues  confronting  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  sector  in  Pakistan1.  At \npresent,  the  overall  water  supply  coverage  in  Pakistan  is  63%  and  sanitation  39%  of  the  total \npopulation.   \n \n3. \nPunjab  is  the  most  heavily  populated  province  of  Pakistan.  Despite  its  apparently \naffluent agricultural economy, the social indicators of Punjab compare poorly with those of most \nother provinces in the country. In fiscal year (FY) 1999, 33% of Punjab's population was poor, \nand in rural Punjab it was 36% compared with 29% in FY932.  During 1998/99 infant mortality in \nPunjab was 95 per 1,000 live births, against 89 for the country as a whole. At present, overall \nwater supply coverage in rural Punjab is 53%; about half of that is provided by piped systems  \nand the  rest  through  community hand pumps. The remaining 47% of households have to rely \non  often  distantly  located  sources  of  unsafe  water-uncovered  wells,  rivers,  and  rain-fed/canal-\nfed ponds - generally transported by women and children. These groups suffer significantly from \nwaterborne diseases due to the use of water unfit for human consumption, and the cost of heath \ncare  due  to  illness  is  high.  Similarly,  only  about  27%  of  the  rural  population  have  access  to \nsanitation facilities in the form of household latrines. The remaining population defecate in open \nareas,  a  situation  that  is  particularly  difficult  for  females,  as  by  custom  they  can  only  use  the \nfields  either  before  sunrise  or  after  sunset.  The  idea  of  health  benefits  being  associated  with \ngood  hygiene  practices  needs  strengthening  if  the  health  of  rural  communities  is  to  improve. \nDrainage in rural areas is very poor and maintenance of existing drains is commonly neglected, \nwhich results in health hazards such as insect infestations and an environmental hazard such \nas unpleasant odors.   \n \n \n4. \nWhile  some  aid-/NGO-assisted  projects  are  addressing  the  WSS  problems  of  smaller \nvillage  communities3,  larger  villages  remain  unserved  owing  to  financial  and  technical \nconstraints.  The  financial  allocations  to  the  sector  form  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  budgetary \noutlay on social services. As a share in the total budgetary allocations, the amount is estimated \nto  be  as  low  as  0.18%  of  the  GDP,  and  only  0.83%  of  the  total  expenditures  on  public  health \nservices.  The  Government\u2019s  10-year  (2001-2011)  Perspective  Development  Plan  (PDP)  has  a \ngross allocation of only 6.8% for physical planning and housing sector, only 1.1% of which has \nbeen  earmarked  for  WSS.  This  compares  poorly  with  the  18%  available  for  transport  and \ncommunications, and 14% for power. The result is severe cash-flow problems in implementing \n                                                 \n1   Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission 2001.

Khan  Rural  Development  Project  and  Orangi  Pilot  Project \n\n \n\n(OPP)-supported Lodhran Pilot Project.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthe  nationwide  public  health  engineering  departments\u2019  (PHED's)  ongoing  projects,  with  many \nWSS schemes remaining incomplete. \n \n5. \nNationwide,  PHEDs  have  constructed  schemes  following  a  top  down  approach  to \nplanning  and  have  designed  schemes  that  were  costly  and  technically  difficult  for  local \ncommunities  to  maintain.  In  view  of  this,  the  Government,  with  assistance  from  external \nagencies sought to lift the constraints on the rural water supply sector\u2019s performance. In 1992, it \nmandated  the  adoption  of  a  uniform  policy  framework  nationwide  for  rural  WSS,  and  each \nprovincial  government  has  adopted  this  policy  framework,  which  provides  that  (i)  for  all  new \nrural  WSS  schemes,  the  communities  will  be  involved  in  design  and  implementation.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  investment  cost.  After  their  completion,  the  schemes  would  be \nhanded  over  to  the  communities  for  full  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  (ii)  all  ongoing \nschemes,  and  those  requiring  rehabilitation,  managed  by  PHED,  will  be  handed  over  to  the \ncommunities; (iii) PHED will provide the communities with training in O&M of the schemes; and \n(iv) to cover O&M cost, the communities will open an O&M account at the local bank, deposit an \namount  equivalent  to  2  months'  O&M  expenses  as  an  initial  commitment,  and  designate \nrepresentatives to operate the account and maintain the schemes. Detailed subproject selection \ncriteria following the uniform framework for the rural WSS sector are in Appendix 2. \n \n6. \nTo  specifically  address  the  WSS  problem  in  rural  Punjab,  the  Government,  in  1994, \nrequested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  A loan of $46 million from the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  was  approved  by  ADB  in  January  1995  for  the \nPunjab  Rural  WSS  Sector  Project  (phase  I  project)  to  provide  low-cost,  low-technology  WSS \nsubprojects in seven districts where the situation was serious. The Project, which was closed in \nMay 2002, has provided safe drinking water and drainage facilities to about 800,000 people of \n335 mostly poor and remote villages of 7 priority districts (out of a total 34 districts) of Punjab \nthrough  simple,  low-cost  subprojects  using  the  community-based  approach.  The  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation carried out under the project and verified during the preparation of the \nproposed Project has indicated that the project had considerable development impacts such as \nsignificant  decrease  in  the  cases  of  waterborne  diseases,  increase  in  household  income, \nincrease  in  enrollment  of  schoolchildren,  and  considerable  environmental  improvement.  The \ncommunities of the project districts are responsible for 100% O&M cost of the subprojects and \nall the subprojects that were handed over are being operated by communities without any major \nproblem.  The  demonstrated  success  of  the  phase  I  project  has  not  only  created  myriad \nopportunities  to  the  mostly  very  poor  (beneficiary  communities)  getting  rid  of  waterborne \ndiseases  and  diverting  their  time  savings  to  income-generating  activities,  it  has  also  created \nawareness of the benefits of community-based WSS projects from the Government subsidized \ninefficient WSS sector to an efficient community-run system.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nExperience in the phase I project reveals that the provision of safe drinking water in the \nhouse or close to it saves substantial time of the village communities, particularly women. It thus \ngenerates  a  demand  for  credit  and  technical  assistance  to  setup  income-generating  ventures \nand help the women to get out of acute poverty. Similarly, due to increased school enrollment \nas  a  result  of  providing  of  water  at  their  doorstep,  children,  particularly  girls,  need  additional \nspace  in  school.  At  present,  no  such  resources/mechanisms  exist  in  the  poor  communities  to \nenable  the  people  to  utilize  the  time  saved  from  fetching  water  and  fully  address  the  issue  of \npoverty reduction and social development. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nthe  province,  was  dismantled  up \n\nAnother  set  of  problems  and  opportunities  is  due  to  the  devolution  plan,  which  has \n8. \ndecentralized  administrative  and  financial  authority  to  local  government  institutions  for \ngovernance,  delivery  of  services,  and  transparent  decision  making  through  institutionalized \nparticipation  of  the  people  at  the  grassroot  level.  But,  while  these  institutions  have  now  been \nentrusted  with  substantial  autonomy  and  heavy  responsibilities,  they  lack  the  necessary \ncapacity to carry out these tasks by themselves and for this purpose still rely on the resources of \nthe provincial line departments. If the situation continues, increased delays in decision making, \ndeclining service standards, and reversal to the previous levels of centralization are likely.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  devolution  process,  the  line  department  PHED,  primarily  responsible  for \n9. \nWSS \nthe  higher  middle  order  management \nto \nin \n(superintendent engineer). The responsibilities for the delivery and O&M of these services are \nnow  entrusted  to  the  tehsil  municipal  administration  (TMA),  where  in  most  cases  a  junior \nengineer (tehsil officer for infrastructure and services) looks after these services, in addition to a \nhost  of  other  responsibilities.  This  situation  has  particularly  affected  the  WSS  sector. \nDevelopment of an adequate capacity in TMAs may take several years, stretching beyond the 4 \nyears of the project implementation period, keeping these institutions from playing a primary role \nin  handling  subproject  construction.  Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  ensure  the  meaningful \ninvolvement  of  the  devolved  institutions  in  the  Project  at  present  and  to  prepare  them  to  take \nover  long-term  sector  development  responsibilities.  Accordingly,  a  two-pronged  approach \nincluding project implementation and institutional capacity building will be pursued. Owing to the \ncurrent deficient capacity of the devolved institutions, project implementation will be carried out \nthrough  the  existing  PMU,  which  has  successfully  implemented  the  phase  I  project.  The \ncapacity  of  the  TMA  will  be  simultaneously  enhanced  to  handle  the  community-based \nimplementation  of  similar  subprojects  in  the  future.  During  the  preparation  of  the  proposed \nProject,  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  TMA  constraints  and  weaknesses  was  made,  and  a \nphased program of capacity building and institutional strengthening was designed for all levels \n(Appendix  3).  The  program  encompasses \nresources \ninformation  system,  and \ndevelopment,  establishment  of  a  computerized  management \nadministration of a complementary training program. To be effective, the program will be carried \nout along with physical improvements in service levels, through a meaningful involvement of all \nconcerned.  \n \n \n10. \nLimited  access  to  WSS  facilities  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  common \ncharacteristics  of  poverty  in  the  country  and  the  root  cause  of  health-related  problems. \nAccordingly, the 10-year PDP aims at increasing the overall coverage of safe drinking water to \n84% and that of sanitation to 63%. For rural settlements its target is to achieve 75% coverage of \nsafe  water  supply  and  50%  for  sanitation  and  drainage.  In  its  poverty  reduction  strategy,  the \nPDP  also  emphasizes  the  provision  of  adequate  funding  for  clean  air  and  water  to  Pakistani \ncitizens,  promotion  of  small  and  intermediate  enterprises,  and  capacity  building  for  institutions \ndelivering services. \n \n11. \nThe  Government  has  resolved  to  continue  implementing  the  rural  WSS  programs,  in \naccordance  with  its  uniform  policy  framework.  The  recently  completed  ADB-assisted  Water \nSector  Strategy  Study  (2002)  also  endorsed  that  rural  WSS  schemes  should  be  community \nbased  and  O&M  should  be  borne  by  the  beneficiaries4.  This  is  important  for  ensuring  the \nparticipation  of  beneficiary  communities  in  all  stages  of  development,  planning,  designing, \nimplementing,  and  O&M.  However,  to  be  effective,  the  newly  installed  local  government \n                                                 \n4  An allocation of PRs10 billion, which is based on the recommended allocations for water resources, was made in \n\nresource  mobilization,  human \n\n \n\nthe midterm investment plan (2002-11) for rural water supply and sanitation sector projects. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ninstitutions need a clearer definition of their roles and responsibility, a setting up of vivid vertical \nand  horizontal  linkages,  and  substantial  capacity  building  through  a  carefully  structured  and \nsustained human resource development program.  \n \n12.  Most  WSS  projects  in  Pakistan  have  been  supported  by  international  aid  agencies. \nApproximately  $563  million  of  external  assistance  has  been  committed  to  WSS  since  1995.  \n(Appendix  4).  While  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  been  the  main  sources  of  financial \nassistance,  United  Nations  International  Children's  Emergency  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  United \nNations  Development  Program  (UNDP)  have  been  assisting  through  awareness  raising, \nadvocacy,  institutional  strengthening/capacity  building,  and  networking.  Besides  these,  a \nnumber  of  bilateral  external  support  agencies,  including  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency,  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID),  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), have been among \nthe  most  active  partners  in  the  sector.  A  number  of  national,  provincial  and  local  non \ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  like  National  Rural  Support  Program  (NRSP)  and  the \nProvincial  Rural  Support  Program  (PRSP)  are  also  playing  an  important  role  in  community \ndevelopment in support of WSS. There are thus numerous opportunities to attain synergies by \nworking  in  collaboration  with  these  agencies,  particularly  in  awareness  raising,  household \nsanitation, hygiene education, and microcredit for income generation among the beneficiaries of \nWSS schemes. The successful implementation of the phase I project presents a strong case for \nreplication in the hitherto unserved areas of the province. \n \n13. \nADB's  sector  loan  modality  was  selected  to  provide  the  assistance  because  it  is \nconsidered  the  most  appropriate  method  of  financing  the  Project.  ADB's  sector  loan  criteria \nhave  been  generally  met.  As  part  of  the  Government's  PDP,  the  rural  water  supply  sector \ninvestment  plan  under  the  Project  is  well-conceived  and  appropriately  formulated  to  meet  the \npriority needs of the sector. The sector institutions have the capability to implement the sector \ndevelopment plan, and sector policies are appropriate. \n \n14. \nA  community-based  approach  to  subproject  formulation,  implementation,  and  O&M \nrecently adopted by the Government should sustain the project facilities. The sector institutions \nhave  considerable  experience  in  constructing  conventional  water  supply  schemes.  The  sector \npolicies are generally sound. Further improvements in the sector policies have been discussed \nand agreed upon with the Government, in the context of policy dialogue (paras 54 - 58). \n \n15. \nKey  lessons  learned  from  the  ADB-financed  WSS  projects  in  Pakistan,  particularly  the \nphase  I  project;  regional  experiences;  and  the  review  of  selected  multilateral,  bilateral,  and \nNGOs-managed projects in the country, carried out during the preparation of the Project (May \u2013 \nAugust  2002)  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  (i)  to  ensure  sustainability  of  community-based \nprojects, it is essential that both male and female community groups are involved in planning, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  O&M;  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  have  enough \ncapacity  to  assume  their  functions,  and  having  been  trained  in  the  early  stage  of  project \nimplementation; (ii) subproject selection criteria should be widely disseminated for making them \ntransparent,  avoiding  its  misinterpretation,  and  benefiting  majority  of  communities;  (iii) \ncommunity  willingness  to  pay  for  services  is  often  much  higher  than  expected;  (iv)  the  local \nprivate sector usually responds well to small rural WSS schemes, and is generally efficient and \ncost-effective; and construction activities should be properly packaged to capture economies of \nscale;  (v)  more  attention  must  be  given  to  gender  considerations,  sanitation,  and  hygiene \neducation  components  so  as  to  achieve  lasting  results;  (vi)  start-up  implementation  delays \nshould  be  avoided  by  taking  advance  action  before  loan  effectiveness  -  PC-I  approval, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nestablishment of the project management unit (PMU) and the appointment of the project director \nand  PMU  staff,  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  prequalification  of  contractors;  (vii)  advance \naction  need  to  be  taken  during  the  execution  of  subprojects  for  the  electrification  of  pumping \nwells to avoid delays in operationalizing the subproject after physical completion; (viii) to ensure \nquality construction and timely completion, consultants\u2019 involvement and responsibilities should \nbe  enhanced  and  payment  to  contractors  should  be  linked  with  consultants\u2019  verification  of  the \nquality of fieldwork; (ix) low salaries can result in high community development unit (CDU) staff \nturnover, which will adversely effect implementation progress and the quality of CDU activities. \nA summary of lessons learned and measures to incorporate them in the Project are in Appendix \n5.   \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nObjectives  \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  overall  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty,  and  improve  the  living  conditions \n16. \nand  quality  of  life  of  the  communities  in  rural  settlements  in  Punjab  Province  where  water  is  \nscarce  and  groundwater  is  brackish.    The  project  seeks  to:  (i)  extend  -  through  a  community \nbased,  demand-driven  approach  -  water  supply,  drainage,  and  sanitation  coverage  to  poor \nvillage communities that do not have access to organized water supply and are located in the \nbrackish  and  barani  areas  of  Punjab;  (ii)  strengthen  newly  constituted  TMAs  and  build  their \ncapacity  to  organize  community-based  water  supply  and  drainage  schemes  and  improve \nrelated management functions; (iii) implement a hygiene education program including assisting \nselected  beneficiaries  in  the  project  tehsils  construct  household  latrines  through  a  revolving \nfund;  and  (iv)  implement  a  social  uplift  and  poverty  eradication  (SUPER)  program  aimed  at \nusing the time saved in fetching water in more productive and livelihood activities, particularly \nfor  women,  through  a  microcredit  system,  and  constructing  additional  classrooms  in  schools \nwhere  enrollment  has  increased  because  children  were  released  from  the  chore  of  fetching \nwater.   \n \n17. \nThe Project intends to use a community-based approach to extend WSS facilities to 54 \ntehsils  in  26  districts  of  Punjab,  which  are  facing  water  scarcity  and  saline  groundwater \ncondition.  The  identified  tehsils,  mostly  villages  with  a  population  of  more  than  1,000  and \ncomprising  about  91%  of  the  total  population  in  brakish/barani  areas,  will  receive  priority. \nHowever,  any  village  located  in  the  above  tehsils  and/or  other  tehsils  with  smaller  population \nwould  also  be  considered  if  the  subproject  is  technically  viable  and  communities  accept  O&M \nresponsibilities as per subproject selection criteria. Construction of about 500 new subprojects \nand  rehabilitation  of  about  250  need-based  inoperative  subprojects  (implemented  by  PHED, \nprior to the phase I project) will be included in the Project. A population of about 2.3 million will \nbe covered. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  comprises  four  components:  (i)  construction  of  water  supply  and  drainage \n18. \nfacilities, (ii) hygiene education program, (iii) institutional strengthening and capacity building for \nlocal government institutions, and (iv) social uplift and poverty eradication program. \n \n \n \n \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nConstruction of Water Supply and Drainage Facilities \n\nThis component consists of the construction of simple, low-cost water supply, drainage, \n\n \n19. \nand sanitation facilities in about 500 project communities and rehabilitation of 250 need-based   \ninoperative schemes meeting the subproject selection criteria. Of the 500 new subprojects, 450 \nwill  be  pump-based  subprojects  and  50  gravity-based.  Ten  sites  will  be  identified  for  the  rain-\nharvesting subprojects. \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nHygiene Education Program \n\n \n20. \nThis  component  consists  of  a  hygiene  education  program  in  the  project  villages,  as \nformulated  and  implemented  under  the  phase  I  project.  Education  material,  service  vehicles, \nand  consulting  services  will  support  the  program.  This  component  includes  establishing  a \nrevolving fund to assist selected beneficiaries in project villages to install household latrines. As \nsuccessfully implemented in the phase I project, the communities will, through male and female \nCBOs, be provided latrine components according to their choice of material, without any subsidy \nbut  with  payment  in  2-3  easy  installments  to  CBO.  CBO  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the \nfund  to  recover  the  cost  of  latrines  from  the  people,  and  will  procure  another  batch  of  latrine \ncomponents as per the community demand. The community development unit (CDU) staff and \nproject  consultants  will  give  specific  training  to  women  councilors  and  lady  health  workers  to \nplay  a  catalytic  role  in  hygiene  education  and  household  latrine  promotion.  The  village  school \nwill  be  used  as  a  hub  of  sanitation  promotion  in  the  community.  Based  on  the  successful \nexperience of UNICEF in Pakistan, student-parent and interchild communication techniques will \nbe  used  extensively  to  promote  sanitation.5  The  revolving  fund  to  be  managed  jointly  by  male \nand female CBOs for the latrine construction program will be provided from the project imprest \naccount, which will be adjusted at the completion of the Project, as in the phase I project.  \n \n21. \nAll schools in the project area will be provided with latrines and connections for supply of \nsafe drinking water. The Project will monitor the effects of water quality improvements on health \nespecially child stunting, by organizing a representative sample study and project performance \nmanagement system (PPMS). \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building  \n\n \n22. \nThis component will help attain long-term sector goals by building the capacity of TMAs \nto manage the new responsibilities acquired from the provincial and federal governments after \nimplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  devolution  plan.  Major  interventions  will  include  resource \nmobilization through an efficient collection of revenue, improved financial management including \nbudgeting and enhanced O&M of TMA assets; identification of the local government needs for \noffice and field equipment and extending appropriate assistance for their procurement; human \nresource development through an objectively designed training program; and establishment of a \ncomputerized  management  information  system  (MIS)  and  training  to  manage  the  human \nresources, monetary resources, raw materials, and capital resources of the TMAs in all districts \nof  Punjab.  Consulting  services,  MIS  software,  and  education  material  will  be  provided.    This \ncomponent  will  be  implemented  in  collaboration  with  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  and  future \nprograms related to  capacity building of TMAs and in accordance with  the updated devolution \nplan.  This component also extends institutional support to the PMU in executing the Project by \nproviding  (i)  consulting  services,  (ii)  equipment  and  service  vehicles,  and  (iii)  operational  cost \nsupport for the project implementation offices on a declining basis.  \n                                                 \n5  UNICEF. 2002.

The microcredit component will comprise a variety \nof credit schemes to finance handicrafts, embroidery, carpet and rug weaving, and livestock and \npoultry etc. The Government will implement SUPER initially in 30 villages of the phase I project \nwhere  the  communities  are  already  successfully  operating  and  maintaining  subprojects,  and \nhave already taken some initiatives for income generation activities on a self-help basis with the \nhelp  of  their  female  CBOs  (Appendix  6).  If  successful,  SUPER  will  be  expanded  to  the \nremaining  areas  of  phase  I  and  the  proposed  Project.  This  initial  phase  will  introduce  the \nsubborrowers to use of group-based microfinance that will lead to linkages with the microfinance \ninstitutions6  for  continued  and  greater  access  to  microfinance  services.  The  interest  rate \ncharged will be consistent with that charged by established microfinance institutions. \n \n25. \nThe core component of the proposed system is a community development fund (CDF) at \neach union council (UC) level, to be managed by a UC-level SUPER committee, with a majority \nof  women  members:  women  councilors,  female  community-based  motivators  (CBMs),  and \nrepresentative of women CBOs. The CDF will have two components: the first will be a revolving \nfund for microenterprise development, and the second will be a conduit for expenditure required \nfor  classrooms  construction.  SUPER  covers  the  provision  of  financial  assistance,  a  local \ncommunity liaison advisor, and service vehicles. The funds for SUPER will be released from the \nproject  imprest  account.  The  UC-based  SUPER  committees  will  assume  full  responsibility  for \ncontinuing SUPER after project completion. \n  \nC. \n \n26. \nThe socioeconomic surveys conducted for the proposed Project and also in the phase I \nproject  revealed  that  the  household  income  for  more  than  90%  of  the  project  area  is  below \nPRs3,800  ($63)  per  month.  This  shows  that  people  from  the  extremely  poor  areas  of  rural \nPunjab, especially women, are the main beneficiaries of these projects. The phase I project has \nalready demonstrated economic benefits and significant social development due to provision of \nsafe  drinking  water:  reduced  waterborne  diseases  and  related  expenditure,  and  improved \nhealth. With these benefits, people have more time to invest in agricultural activities and other \nincome- generating activities. In addressing the core poverty issue, it has been considered that \nthe  time  saved,  mainly  by  women  and  children  in  fetching  water,  should  be  used  in  more \nproductive and livelihood activities that had been desperately needed during implementation of \nthe  phase  I  project.  Similarly,  in  villages  where,  due  to  provision  of  water,  children  have  been \nfreed from the chore of fetching water, an increase in school enrollment mainly among girls was \nnoted. In many cases, additional classrooms are required. In view of this, the Government has \nagreed  to  include  SUPER  in  the  proposed  Project  as  a  special  feature,  for  income  generation \nthrough the microcredit system as a revolving fund, and for providing additional classrooms in \n                                                 \n6  Khushhalibank,  First  Microfinance  Bank,  and  those  being  promoted  by  the  proposed  Rural  Finance  Sector \n\nSpecial Features \n\nDevelopment Program. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nthe  schools.  The  microcredit  schemes  have  been  run  with  a  great  degree  of  success  in \nPakistan7  where  they  were  implemented  simultaneously  with  infrastructure  improvement \nprograms.  \n \nSuccessful  O&M  of  phase  I  project  schemes  by  communities  has  resulted  mainly  from \n27. \nthe  sense  of  ownership  given  to  them  for  the  demand-driven  schemes  and  women's  active \nparticipation  in  tariff  collection  and  social  development  works.  It  is  believed  that,  if  the \ncommunities\u2019 sense of ownership is enhanced by their share in the capital cost of the subproject \nin cash or in kind, the results will be enhanced sustainability of the schemes and a considerable \nreduction in the overall cost of the subprojects. In the consultants\u2019 survey during the preparation \nof the Project, several communities showed their willingness to share 4-20% of the capital cost \nin  cash  and  in  kind.  Depending  on  the  communities\u2019  ability  to  pay,  various  options  for  cost-\nsharing have been worked out by the consultants, and policy agreement with the Government \nhas  been  reached  that  all  future  rural  WSS  schemes  will  have  the  community  share  in  the \ncapital cost in cash and/or in kind.    \n \nThe phase I project extended WSS facilities to the villages with a minimum population of \n28. \n1,200. The criteria have also been made flexible to encompass clusters of smaller settlements \nby including components to protect alternative sources such as lining the walls of shallow wells, \ninstalling injector pumps in small wells, introducing rainwater harvesting, and adding a drainage \ncomponent where water supply was already provided to enable the maximum number of people \nto benefit from safe drinking water and drainage facilities through the Project. Unlike the phase I \nproject,  the  Project  will  encompass  rehabilitation  of  need-based  inoperative  schemes  where  a \nminor investment at the water source and/or extension of the distribution and drainage network \nwill activate these schemes to benefit thousands.  \n \nD. \n \nBased  on  the  indicative  list  of  750  subprojects  and  other  components,  the  total  cost  of \n29. \nthe Project is estimated at $71.4 million equivalent (including taxes and duties of $5.5 million), of \nwhich $13.6 million (19%) is the foreign currency cost including $1.1 million in interest charges \nduring  construction,  and  $57.8  million  equivalent  (81%)  is  the  local  currency  costs.    Table  1 \ngives the summary of the costs. Details are given in Appendix 7.  \n \nE. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $50 million equivalent from its Special Funds \n30. \nresources, which will represent 70% of the total cost of the Project. The ADB loan will have a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate charge of 1% per annum \nduring  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions \nset  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  ADB  will  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost \ncomponent  of  the  project  in  the  amount  of  $13.6  million  (including  about  $1.1  million  interest \nduring  construction),  and  will  finance  $36.4  million  equivalent  or  63%  of    the  local  currency \ncost8.  The  local  currency  cost  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  cover  portions  of  the  civil  works, \nhygiene  education  program,  SUPER,  and  the  entire  cost  of  equipment  and  material,  and \n                                                 \n7  The  microcredit  component  of  the  Orangi  Pilot  Project,  now  being  successfully  implemented  as  Lodhran  Pilot \nProject, in one of the project districts, has almost 100% cost  recovery. Similarly, ADB-assisted D. G. Khan Rural \nDevelopment  Project  is  pursuing  an  integrated  infrastructure  development    and  microcredit  program.  In  both \nprojects, the microcredit component not only has resulted in multiplying the impact of infrastructure improvements, \nit has also acted as a good incentive to attract community participation. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n8   ADB will finance 66% of part A cost (51% of local currency and 100% foreign), 70% of part B, C and D. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nconsulting services, ADB\u2019s financing of the local currency expenditure is justified by the nature \nof  the  Project,  which  will  address  local  poverty,  gender,  and  health  issues  within  the  project \nareas.  The  Government  will  onlend  the  loan  to  Punjab  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions. \nPunjab  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  and  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to \nHousing,  Urban  Development,  and  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (HUD&PHED)  as \ngrant through budgetary allocation. \n \n31. \nThe  Government  of  Punjab  will  provide  $16.8  million  equivalent  (23.5%)  in  local \ncurrency,  and  will  cover  part  of  the  civil  works,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  other \ncounterpart funding required for project implementation. The beneficiaries will contribute about \n$4.6  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  (6.5%),  mostly  in  kind  and  labor.

The Project will be \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nimplemented through a PMU, located at HUD&PHED. The PMU, headed by the project director \nand  comprising  professional  staff,  supported  by  a  team  of  consultants  and  CDU  staff,  will  be \nresponsible  at  the  provincial  level  for  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation  and \nmanagement of project activities. CDU staff recruited by HED&PHED will be supervised by the \nconsultants.  For  province-wide  implementation  of  the  Project  in  26  districts,  six  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established,  each  headed  by  a  deputy  project  director \n(equivalent  to  executive  engineer).  The  PIUs  will  be  located  at  Rawalpindi,  Sargodha,  Sialkot, \nFaisalabad,  Multan,  and  Bahawalpur.  Thirteen  project  implementation  cells  (PICs)  at  the \nrepresentative tehsil headquarters, each managed by an assistant project director (equivalent to \nsubdivisional officer), will assist the PIUs in executing the Project.  \n \n33. \nThe Government has agreed to retain the PMU of the phase I project, including its key \ntechnical and CDU staff.  The project director was appointed before the loan negotiations. Most \nof the PMU, PIUs, and PICs will be manned by staff deputed from HUD&PHED and TMAs and \nwill  return  to  the  parent  department/administrations  on  the  completion  of  the  Project.  Some  of \nthe  staff  will,  however,  be  engaged  on  a  contract  basis.  The  implementation  framework  of  the \nProject is presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n \n34. \nBesides pump-based new and rehabilitation subprojects, the Project also includes small \nsubprojects  (costing  less  than  $0.5  million),  whose  implementation  will  be  facilitated  through \nlocal NGOs.  \n \n35. \n \n\nFor internal coordination, two committees will be set up: \n\na subprojects implementation review committee (SIRC) at tehsil level, comprising \nmale and female representatives from TMA and UC, male and female CBOs, and \nthe  PMU  will  look  after  the  implementation  progress  of  all  the  subprojects  in  a \ntehsil at monthly intervals. Headed by a tehsil head \u2013 the Nazim, the tehsil and \nUC-level women councilors are envisioned to play a key role in the SIRCs; and   \n\na project steering committee (PSC) \u2013 headed by the secretary  of HUD&PHED, \nwith senior officers from the departments of planning and development; finance, \nlocal  government  and  rural  development,  and  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority  (WAPDA)  as  members  \u2013  will  be  set  up  at  HUD&PHED  in  Lahore  to \nensure  smooth  and  orderly  implementation.  The  secretary  will  also  invite  the \nNazims  of  those  tehsils,  where  progress  needs  considerable  improvement.  A \nPSC meeting will be held at least once every 3 months.  \n\n \n36. \nAs in the phase I project, community development activities for all Project tehsils under \neach PIU will be undertaken through a team of one community development officer (CDO) and \ntwo community-based motivators (CBMs); one male and one female. HUD&PHED will appoint \none  CDO  at  each  PIU  to  carry  out,  with  the  help  of  UC  and  CBO,  the  hygiene  education  and \nlatrine  promotion  activities,  and  undertake  SUPER  with  the  help  of  CBOs,  UCs,  project \nconsultants, CDU staff, and NGOs.   \n \n37. \nUCs  and  TMAs  will  identify  the  subprojects.  The  PMU  and  the  TMAs/UCs  jointly  will \nmake a shortlist following the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 2) and extensive field visits \nby  the  CDU  staff.  The  PIC  and  CDU  staff  will  also  assist  the  TMAs/UCs  in  identifying  the \nsubprojects. Besides periodic reviews through SIRC, TMA will depute its staff to work with the \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nPIC staff and the consultants during implementation and also liaise between TMA and the PMU \nto efficiently implement these tasks. \n \n38. \nTo  update  the  PPMS  and  follow  up  on  the  completed  subprojects,  staff  of  TMA/UC \ntogether  with  CDU  staff  and  the  subengineer  will  visit  the  subprojects  at  6-month  intervals.  \nThey  will  provide  feedback  to  the  PIUs  and  the  PMU  for  addressing  any  problem  and  for \nupdating the MIS and PPMS. TMAs will continue to engage themselves in PPMS for at least 3 \nyears after Project is completed. \n \n39. \nUCs  will  also  play  a  central  role  in  managing  the  SUPER.  Although  fully  involved  from \nthe  very  beginning,  the  UC-based  SUPER  committees  will  assume  full  responsibility  for \ncontinuing SUPER for about 5 years after winding up the PMU at project completion. Owing to \nthe  women-focused  nature  of  SUPER,  the  female  members  of  these  committees  will  have  a \nmajority.   \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n40. \nThe Government has kept the PMU intact, and initiated advance actions for prequalifying \ncontractors, and recruiting consultants. About 70 subprojects have already been identified and \nsurveys and technical designs of 30 subprojects have been undertaken during the preparation \nof the Project. For the counterpart fund sharing, the Government has allocated PRs200 million \nin the current financial year (2002/03). With advance actions, the Project is unlikely to face initial \nstart-up delays. Accordingly, the implementation period has been estimated as 4 years, starting \nin 2003. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n3. \n \n41. \nEach  subproject  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  agreed  with  the \nGovernment (Appendix 2): (i) the subproject is primarily located in a brackish or barani area; (ii) \nthe  community  does  not  currently  have  an  organized  water  supply  system;  (iii)  the  beneficiary \ncommunity is willing to form a CBO to undertake O&M of the subproject and to share its capital \ncost as reflected in Appendix 2 and a scheme-specific tariff to defray the O&M costs; (iv) PMU \nwill  prepare  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and,  as  required,  an  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA);  and  (v)  CBO  will  sign  two  memorandums  of  understanding  (MOUs) \nsubstantially  in  line  with  the  sample  MOUs  agreed  upon  between  HUD&PHED  and  ADB \n(Appendix 2). The first MOU relates to the community\u2019s commitment to take over the subproject \nwith full responsibility for O&M; the other MOU refers to voluntary transfer of ownership of small \nparcels of land for the subproject. Implementation of any subproject estimated to cost more than \n$300,000 will require ADB's approval, to ensure the use of simple and cost-effective techniques. \nOther  subprojects  will  require  HUD&PHED's  approval,  but  ADB  will  also  review  these \nsubprojects selectively to ensure compliance with the selection criteria. HUD&PHED through the \nPMU  and  the  CBO  will  implement  the  approved  subproject  in  accordance  with  the  MOU \nbetween CBO and HUD&PHED. \n \n42. \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria,  which  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  uniform  policy \nframework  for  rural  WSS  sector,  have  been  discussed  with  the  elected  representatives  of  the \nproject  tehsils  and  disseminated  in  the  two  stakeholder  workshops  held  during  project \npreparation. Besides tehsil representatives, the workshop participants were the officials from the \nGovernment of Punjab, aid agencies, NGOs, and project community members.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n \n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nAll procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \n43. \nGuidelines for Procurement  reflecting ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and mandatory use of ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents.  \n \nAs  most  of  the  civil  works  contracts  are  expected  to  be  small  with  values  of  $8,000  to \n44. \n$400,000,  international  contractors  are  not  likely  to  be  interested.  Therefore,  all  civil  works \ncontracts are expected to be awarded under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB. To attract large domestic firms, the contracts will be grouped into packages, to the extent \npossible, costing $100,000 \u2013 $1,000,000 (Appendix 9). \n \n45. \nAll  equipment  and  materials  as  well  as  service  vehicles  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  shopping.  Certain  items  may  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Some equipment and vehicles packaged at a contract value of \nless than $50,000 will be procured under direct purchase procedures. \n\n \n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n46. \nOverall consulting services will comprise: (i) 613 person-months of domestic consultants  \nto  support  project  implementation;  (ii)  4  person-months  of    an  international  consultant,  on  an \nintermittent basis, to provide overall project management advice and supervision; and (iii)  572 \nperson-months  of  CDOs  to  undertake  community  development  activities,  HUD&PHED  will \nrecruit the CDOs as individual consultants, as done for the phase I project.  \n \n47. \nThe  consultants  will  be  selected  as  consulting  firms  or  as  individuals  to  be  financed \nunder the Project. Firms will be selected in accordance with the quality and cost-based selection \n(QCBS)  method  of  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and/or  other  arrangements \nacceptable to the ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Individual domestic consultants and \nCDU  staff,  and  the  international  consultant  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines \nand selection procedures for engaging individuals.   \n \n48. \nThe consulting services are designed to support the Project as well as build the longer \nterm capacity of newly established local government institutions. The consultants will:  (i) assist \nin  groundwater \nin  designing  and \ninvestigations/water  quality  monitoring,  hydrogeological  studies,  and  construction  supervision; \n(iii) strengthen and build the capacity of TMAs, UCs, and CBOs; and (iv) establish and operate a \nprovince-wide MIS and PPMS. Draft terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix \n10.  \n \n\nimplementing  WSS  subprojects;  (ii)  have  expertise \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  Government  will  take  advance  action  on  recruiting \n49. \nconsultants  and  prequalifying  the  contractors.  Both  provincial  and  federal  governments  have \nassured that the planning commission proforma - I (PC-I) of the Project will be approved before \nloan effectiveness. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nRegarding the PMU, the Government of Punjab (GPb) agreed to retain the PMU of the \n50. \nphase I project and its key staff after the loan closing date of 31 August 2002 for the Project. It \nhas  also  assured  that  all  phase  I  project  vehicles,  computers,  printers,  and  other  logistics  will \nremain  with  the  PMU  for  the  proposed  Project.  GPb  also  agreed  to  retain  the  key  staff  of  the \nCDU  of  phase  I  for  undertaking  the  subproject  preparatory  activities,  which  include  a  needs \nassessment  survey,  identifying  subprojects,  and  mobilizing  the  community  and  forming  CBOs. \nTo  expedite  implementation,  GPb  plans  to  undertake  topographic  digitized  surveys  and \nelectrical  resistivity  surveys  of  the  first  70  subprojects  identified  during  the  preparation  of  the \nProject.  ADB  approved  in  principle  retroactive  financing  of  $100,000  equivalent  to  finance  the \nservices  of  the  CDU  staff  and  the  surveys  of  the  identified  subprojects  under  part  A  of  the \nProject.  Retroactive  financing  will  be  limited  to  expenditures  incurred  between  6  September \n2002 and loan effectiveness. GPb has been informed that the approval of advance actions and \nretroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  expenditures  thereunder  or  the \nProject. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n51. \nFor  easier  financial  control,  disbursement  categories  will  be  established  by  subproject \nand  by  expenditure  type  (work,  goods,  and  services).  The  PMU  will  prepare  disbursement \nprojections and request budget allocations for counterpart funds. For timely release of the loan \nproceeds, portions of the proceeds will be deposited in an imprest fund account. The GPb will \nestablish the account in the name of PHED. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the account \nwill  consist  of  advances  based  on  estimates  of  anticipated  expenditure  to  be  incurred  for  a  6-\nmonth  period.  The  account  will  be  established,  operated,  and  maintained  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedures  may  be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000,  and  to  liquidate  advances \nmade  into  the  imprest  account  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines.  PMU/HUD&PHED  will \ncoordinate the timely release of funds. This is essential because project activities will take place \nat  different  locations  and  simple  mechanisms  are  required  to  disburse  small  funds  quickly \nthrough decentralized decision making while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures. The \nannual  audit  report  will  have  a  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and \nSOE procedures. \n\n \n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nHUD&PHED,  acting  through  the  PMU,  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \n52. \nidentify works, goods, and services financed by the loan proceeds. Specifically, HUD&PHED will \n(i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project;  (ii)  ensure  that  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements are audited annually in accordance with sound accounting principles by independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB; and (iii) submit to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of \neach fiscal year, certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements and the auditor\u2019s \nreport on them. \n \nHUD&PHED/PMU will prepare monthly progress reports, in a format acceptable to ADB, \n53. \nwith  information  on  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  pre-identified \nmonitoring indicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; \n(iii)  CDU  activities;  (iv)  work  done  by  the  consultants;  (v)  updated  results  of  water  quality \nmonitoring  and  action  taken  on  the  encountered  problems;  (vi)  progress  made  on  PPMS;  (vii) \ncompliance with the loan covenants; (viii) proposed program of activities for the next month; and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n(ix) progress expected during the next 3 months. The monthly report will be submitted to ADB \nby the end of the first week of the following month. Within 3 months of the physical completion \nof the Project, HUD&PHED will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on the \nexecution of the Project including costs and compliance with the loan covenants. \n \n\n9. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nIn  the  interest  of  project  sustainability  and  enhancement  of  the  rural  WSS  sector  in \n\n \nAs  in  the  phase  I  project,  the  WSS  subprojects  will  be  supported  by  ADB  only  if  a \n\n \n54. \nPunjab, the following specific sector policy issues were agreed upon with the GPb. \n \n55. \ncommunity-based approach, as per the subproject selection criteria (Appendix 2) are followed.  \n \n56. \nDepending  on  affordability  to  the  communities,  various  options  for  cost  sharing  were \nworked  out  during  preparation  of  the  Project,  and  policy  agreement  with  the  Government  was \nreached that all future rural WSS schemes will include the community share in the capital cost, \nin cash and/or in kind.    \n \n57. \nThe phase I project extended WSS facilities to the villages with a minimum population of \n1,200.  In the proposed Project, the criteria were made flexible to encompass clusters of smaller \nsettlements  by  including  components  to  protect  alternative  sources  such  as  lining  the  walls  of \nshallow  wells,  installing  injector  pumps  on  small  wells,  improving  rainwater  harvesting,  and \nadding  a  sole  drainage  component  where  water  supply  was  already  provided  to  benefit  the \nmaximum  number  of  people.  Unlike  the  phase  I  project,  the  Project  will  encompass \nrehabilitation of need-based inoperative schemes where minor investment at the water source \nand/or extension of the distribution and drainage network will activate these schemes to benefit \nthousands of the needy population.  \n \nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  of  the  Project  will  assist  tehsils  to  build \n58. \ncapacity \nfinancial  management,  and  community-based \napproaches. It will include assistance to establish a CDU within HUD&PHED and provide CDO, \nand CBMs for all the project districts. \n \n\ntechnical  operations,  sound \n\nin \n\n10. \n\nCost Recovery and Collection Efficiency \n\n \n59. \nGPb has also agreed that, following the successful practice in the phase I project. CBOs \nwith  the  assistance  from  the  PMU  will  introduce  subproject-specific  tariff  sufficient  to  recover \nO&M  costs.  Water  connection  for  those  who  do  not  pay  will  be  promptly  disconnected  with \nassistance  from  UCs,  and  community  peer  pressure  will  be  used  to  collect  tariffs  and  to \nconserve water. Similar techniques will be used to ensure timely repayments under the SUPER \nprogram. \n \n\n11. \n\nPreventive Maintenance Schedule \n\n \n60. \nHUD&PHED has agreed that the preventive maintenance schedules, already developed \nin  the  Urdu  language  in  the  phase  I  project,  will  be  distributed  to  the  CBOs  of  all  the  existing \nprovince-wide community-based HUD&PHED schemes. The CBOs will be trained in O&M of the \nsystem under the Project. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\n12. \n\nProject Performance Management System  \n\n61. \nTo ensure that subprojects are managed efficiently and that the benefits are maximized, \na  benefit  monitoring    and  evaluation  (BME)  system  developed  in  the  phase  I  project  will  be \nfurther  modified  during  project  preparation,  as  a  PPMS  for  the  Project.  This  may  further  be \nrefined  by  the  project  consultants  in  coordination  with  TMAs/UCs  and  the  communities  during \nimplementation. Since implementation of each subproject is estimated to range from 6 months \nto 1 year, the benefits of completed subprojects will be evaluated 6 months after the completion \nof  a  subproject  and  at  the  same  interval  afterwards.  PPMS  reports  will  be  prepared  6  months \nafter completion of the first subproject and submitted to ADB. HUD&PHED will also carry out a \nthird  party  validation  of  the  report,  through  NGOs  or  Project  consultants,  before  the  midterm \nreview (MTR) mission, and after project completion. TMAs, being the ultimate custodians of the \nsubprojects,  will  continue  to  update  the  PPMS  and  MIS  for  at  least  3  years  after  project \ncompletion. \n \n\n13. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nBesides the regular performance review and evaluation carried out by the Government \nat the tehsil and provincial levels, the Project will be reviewed jointly by the HUD&PHED/PMU \nand  ADB  biannually  to  assess  implementation  progress.  TMAs  will  continue  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  the  implementation  arrangements.  Each  review  will  recommend  additional  measures \nrequired  to  improve  the  implementation,  and  also  suggest  adjustments  in  the  implementation \narrangements, if needed, particularly the staffing of the PMU, PIUs, PICs, and CDU. In addition, \na  comprehensive  MTR  will  be  carried  out  by  the  provincial  government,  concerned  tehsil \ngovernment,  and  ADB,  after  about  250  subprojects  have  been  approved  for  implementation, \nand 100 are completed. The MTR will (i) critically evaluate project progress and implementation \nprocedures,  procurement  methodology,  PPMS  activities,  the  project  consultants'  performance \nand  community  participation  activities,  actual  versus  forecast  demand  of  water  for  the \nsubprojects,  and  capacity  building  of  TMAs  and  their  role  in  implementing  the  Project;  and  (ii) \nformulate measures to remedy identified weaknesses, to ensure successful implementation and \nachievement of the objectives. The MTR is timed to permit an opportunity to modify subproject \nselection and implementation arrangements, as a considerable portion of the loan proceeds will \nprobably not be utilized by this time.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Project Benefits  \n\n63. \nThe phase I project demonstrates ample evidence of social, environmental, health, and \neconomic  impacts,  specially  its  contribution  to  increased  household  income  and  poverty \nreduction. The community BME system, established under the phase I project, had analyzed the \nfirst  116  schemes  that  were  handed  over  to  the  communities  for  O&M.  The  results  show  a \n91.5%  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases,  a  30%  increase  in  the  household \nincome,  and  a  94%  increase  in  the  enrollment  of  schoolchildren.  These  results  were  also \nverified by the consultants during the preparation of the Project.  \n \n64. \nIt is therefore expected that the proposed Project will generate similar integrated benefits \nwith provision of safe drinking water to improve health, and education with significant impact on \nimproved  environment,  and  human  resource \npoverty  reduction,  gender  development, \ndevelopment in the service area of over 2.3 million residents.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInvolvement of Women \n\n \n \n65. \nThe main project beneficiaries are women and girls who used to spend 2-5 hours daily in \nfetching  water  from  considerable  distance.  The  availability  of  water  on  their  doorstep  will  not \nonly save their time, but also improve the quality of life due to improved hygienic conditions. The \nwomen will be relieved from the stress and discomfort of hauling water, specially during illness \nand extreme weathers, and they will have additional time for rest and leisure activities. They will \nbe  able  to  divert  their  time  and  energy  to  more  productive  social  and  economic  activities, \nincluding better child and house care, farm production activities including tending livestock and \npoultry,  making  handicrafts  and  artifacts,  etc.  The  microcredit  component  of  the  Project  will \nenable  the  communities,  particularly  women,  to  pursue  income-generating  activities.  The  girls, \nwho share the responsibility for water collection, will now be enrolled in schools. In the phase I \nproject, school enrollment mainly of girls doubled in several villages.   \n \n66. \nTo  maximize  benefits,  women  must  be  involved  in  subproject  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation. In several subprojects in the phase I project, the female CBOs formed assisted \ntheir  male  counterparts  in  the  successful  O&M  of  the  subprojects,  and  in  social  development \nworks  using  savings  from  the  water  tariffs.  During  project  preparation,  the  consultants  refined \nthe ways by which women could effectively participate in subproject planning, implementation, \nand importantly O&M. Female CBMs and the female UC councilors will help the local women\u2019s \ngroups  in  forming  female  CBOs  in  all  subprojects.  To  monitor  women\u2019s  effective  participation \nand training opportunities provided, a female assistant director for CDU, appointed on contract \nunder the Project (Appendix 6, and Supplementary Appendix 1), will work with the female CBOs \nand the female CBMs.     \n \n \n \n67. \nThe  socioeconomic  surveys  for  the  proposed  Project  and  also  in  the  phase  I  project \nrevealed  that  the  household  income  of  more  than  90%  in  the  project  area  is  below  PRs3,800 \n($63)  per  month.  Therefore,  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in  extremely  poor  areas  of  rural \nPakistan.  Summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  analysis  are  in  Appendix  11.  The  additional \nincome generated by households, accruing from improved health and reduction in health-related \nexpenditures, and utilizing the saved time of women in income- generating activities will reduce \nthe household poverty level. In addition, some of the households that pump out hazardous and \nunsuitable  water  for  drinking  purposes  from  stagnant  polluted  ponds  will  no  longer  spend  on \nwasteful  investment  and  on  pumping.  Good  WSS  will  help  reduce  poverty  in  the  rural \ncommunities. Improved community health is generally reflected in lower welfare costs and more \nresources  being  available  for  community  programs.  As  actually  demonstrated  in  the  phase  I \nproject, the Project will directly address poverty reduction.  \n \n \n \n68. \nThe  expected  health  benefits  generated  by  the  Project  are  significant.  The  currently \nsourced  water  is  generally  unfit  for  human  consumption  and  carries  the  risk  of  waterborne \ndiseases.  At  present  the  morbidity  rate  in  areas  with  limited  fresh  water  is  estimated  at  about \n200 per 1,000, which is significantly higher than that in areas that have access to areas of fresh \ngroundwater. Similarly, poor-quality water is responsible for about 50% of infant mortality. The \npoor  quality  of  water  infested  with  waterborne  diseases  is  responsible  for  the  significant \nincidence  of  diarrhea  and  typhoid  cases,  both  in  children  and  adults,  in  the  project  area.  This \nresults  in  school  absenteeism  in  children,  and  loss  of  workdays  for  adults.  The  availability  of \nclean  water  will  create  better  and  healthy  conditions  for  the  people  and  thus  will  enhance  the \n\nHealth Benefits and Impacts \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n4. \n\nproductivity levels of the population. The benefit monitoring surveys carried out for the phase I \nproject indicates a significant decrease in morbidity, infant mortality, and incidence of diseases \nand  the  resultant  illness  days.  The  household  sanitation  and  hygiene  education  program \ncomponent  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  create  awareness  of  the  health  benefits  among  the \nbeneficiaries.  \n \n \n \nDuring  the  Project  preparation,  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  carried \n69. \nout  on  30  randomly  selected  subprojects.  The  IEE  concluded  that  no  adverse  or  harmful \nimpacts  of  any  significance  are  evident  and,  therefore,  a  full-scale  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  is  not  required  for  any  subproject.  A  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  is  attached  as \nSupplementary Appendix 2. \n \n \n\nIEE and SIEE \n\n6. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\nImpact on Minorities/Indigenous People \n\n5. \n \n70. \nDuring  the  implementation  of  the  phase  I  project,  in  which  335  schemes  were \nconstructed,  the  political,  religious,  and  ethnic  diversity  of  the  people  within  a  village  were \nreviewed as part of the initial need assessment survey. Detailed analysis of the available reports \nand  actual  field  visits  by  the  consultants  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project  showed  no \nevidence of any negative impact on the above groups mainly because of the very small size of \nthe subprojects. The minority representatives are involved in the water user committees, and all \nminority  households,  wherever  they  exist,  participate  in  planning,  execution,  and  O&M  of  the \nsubprojects without any problem, favor, or discrimination. From experience in all phase I project \nschemes,  the  Project  is  likely  to  have  no  adverse  or  significant  impact  on  indigenous  people. \nNevertheless, impact on indigenous people will still be properly reviewed during implementation \nby  introducing  performance  indicators  in  the  PPMS,  at  baseline  and  during  and  after  project \nexecution. \n \n \n \nSmall-scale  WSS  subprojects  under  the  Project  will  consist  primarily  of  a  network  of \n71. \nunderground  pipelines,  surface  drains,  and  street  surfacing.  By  their  very  nature  these  works \nwill be constructed in the public rights-of-way. Land will, however, be required in small parcels \nfor the purposes of water source development, overhead reservoir, the water transmission line, \nand wastewater disposal works. Experience in the phase I project has shown that communities \nor  individuals  always  volunteered  their  land  for  these  small  facilities  that  benefit  them  directly, \nfor example community-owned unutilized land. As such no resettlement has ever been required. \nThe same was confirmed during the preparation of the Project through a study of 50 randomly \nselected villages in the phase I project. As per ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, an MOU was \nprepared (Appendix 2), that reflects written public agreement of the landowners/users to ensure \nthat the donations are really \u201cvoluntary.\u201d In case of any grievance, Government has agreed that \nthe respective UC, will address the matter.  \n \n \n \n72. \nEconomic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the Handbook for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.  The  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturns (EIRRs) for WSS works, which constitute about 85% of the total base cost of the Project, \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\n7. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nRisk Analysis \n\nNewly  established  district  governments  and \n\nis  about  49.7%.  However,  adding  the  cost  of  other  components  to  each  subproject  gives  an \nEIRR  of  43.8%.  A  review  of  schemes  from  the  phase  I  project  confirms  that  returns  of  this \nmagnitude can be achieved in the proposed Project as well.  Across various types of schemes \nthat were analyzed to determine the economic justification for the Project, the EIRR was 35.4- \n41.4% for the new pumping subprojects, about 70.4% for gravity-based subprojects, and about \n98%  for  the  rehabilitation  subprojects.  A  high  EIRR  with  impact  of  increased  costs  and \ndecreased  benefits  suggests  that  the  project  is  robust  and  has  sound  economic  justification.  \nThe  per  household  tariff  accounts  for  about  3-4%  of  the  low-income  household,  and  the \ncommunities  have  showed  willingness  to  pay  for  the  user  charge.  As  the  subprojects  will  be \nmanaged by the user groups who are obliged to recover full O&M cost as tariff, and since there \nis  no  utility  institution  involved,  financial  analysis  was  not  carried  out.  The  results  of  economic \nanalysis and the financial projections for the 10 representative phase I project schemes are in  \nAppendix 12. \n \n \nB. \n \n73. \ntehsil  administrations,  elected \nnational/provincial  assembly  members,  or  political  elites,  may  interfere  in  the  selection  of \nsubprojects. These risks will be mitigated by broadly disseminating and transparently applying \nthe subproject selection criteria. During implementation of the phase I project and preparation of \nthe proposed Project, the selection criteria were widely disseminated to make them transparent. \nFurther, the role and the responsibilities of consultants, as independent evaluators, have been \nenhanced.  The  CDU  will  prepare  a  checklist  of  the  needs  assessment  survey  results  of  each \nsubproject,  which  will  be  reviewed  and  verified  by  the  consultants  and  submitted  to  ADB  with \nthe  monthly  progress  reports.  Experience  in  the  phase  I  project  shows  that  the  risk  can  be \nsuccessfully managed.  \n \nLack  of  adequate  attention  by  CDU  staff  in  forming  strong  CBOs  and  building  their \n74. \ncapacities through comprehensive training, and lack of community involvement in preparing and \nexecuting subprojects, can result in unsustainable operation after handover of the subprojects. \nAfter  the  phase  I  project  experience,  community  development  techniques  were  improved  and \nthe  role  of  CDU  was  strengthened.  Mandatory  training  for  CBOs,  and  enhanced  community \nparticipation, particularly gender involvement in project preparation, will rectify these risks.      \n \n75. \nDelays  in  electrifying  tubewells,  experienced  in  the  phase  I  project  may  prevent  the \ncommunities  from  benefiting  from  the  subprojects  for  several  months  even  after  their  physical \ncompletion.  Advance  actions  in  applying  for  connection  and  timely  payment  to  and  intensive \nfollow-up with the Water and Power Development Authority, can help in avoiding this risk    \n \n76. \nIn  a  few  instances  in  the  past,  the  community  members  backed  out  from  their \ncommitments to taking over the subprojects for O&M. Experience with other community-based \nprojects  reveals  that  effective  community  participation  at  an  early  stage  and  the  community \ncontribution toward capital cost can greatly minimize this risk. \n \nThere remains the potential hazard of installing a tubewell for extracting groundwater for \n77. \nirrigation  in  the  vicinity  of  the  established  water  supply  source  of  any  subproject.  That  can  \nadversely effect the quality and quantity of water.  The CBOs, with the active support of TMAs, \nwill  ensure  that  no  groundwater  extraction  will  take  place  in  the  vicinity  of  the  water  sources \ndeveloped  under  the  Project.  The  CBO  will  guarantee  this  in  the  MOU  to  be  signed  for  the \nsubproject. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nTo  ensure  good-quality  water  in  all  the  subprojects,  the  PMU  together  with  the  TMAs \n78. \nstaff and CBOs will continue to monitor the water quality in all phase I project schemes and the \nProject  schemes  at  6-month  intervals,  particularly  after  the  monsoon  season.  In  case  of  any \ncontamination identified, urgent measures will be adopted to address the problem. A separate \nappendix on this will be included in the monthly progress report of the Project.  As part of the \nMIS, all these records will be kept in TMAs offices. TMAs/UCs will gradually take over from the \nPMU the responsibility of water quality monitoring and, by the completion of the Project, they will \nbe fully trained in data collection and analysis, and addressing the problems that may occur in \nthe future.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nA.  \n \n79. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  Punjab  have  given  the \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPunjab  will  retain  the  PMU  of  the  phase  I  project  and  its  key  staff  for  the \nproposed  Project.  Punjab  will  also  retain  the  phase  I  project  CDU  staff  for \nidentifying subprojects, and mobilizing the community, and forming CBOs. \nHUD&PHED will ensure that each proposed subproject (new or for rehabilitation) \nmeets the subproject selection criteria before the proposal is approved under the \nloan. \nFor each year of project implementation, Punjab will ensure adequate budgetary \nallocations  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  for  HUD&PHED/PMU  and  their \nrelease in a timely manner. \nPunjab will cause HUD&PHED and the participating tehsils to ensure that each of \nthe following coordination bodies is established by the time indicated below and \nmaintained  during  the  implementation  of  the  Project:  (a)  project  steering \ncommittee  within  1  month  of \n(b)  subprojects \nimplementation  review  committee,  one  for  each  participating  tehsil,  immediately \nafter the first subproject in the tehsil is awarded. \nFor  land  required  for  the  purposes  of  water  source  development,  overhead \nreservoir,  water  transmission  line,  and  wastewater  disposal  works,  an  MOU  will \nbe signed with the landowners/users to ensure that the donations are voluntary. \nIn case of any grievance, the respective UC will address the matter. \nCDU  staff  will  be  hired  on  contract  by  HUD&PHED  and  will  be  offered  salaries \ncompetitive in the market. \n\nloan  effectiveness;  and \n\n(vii)  HUD&PHED  and  all  UCs  will  ensure  that  women  councilors  and  female  CBOs \nwill  participate  in  subproject  planning,  execution,  and  O&M  together  with  the \nmale  CBOs, following the gender strategy agreed between the Government and \nADB. \n\n(viii)  HUD&PHED  will  ensure  that  any  negative  impact  on  indigenous  people  due  to \nthe  Project \n\nproject  development  will  be  properly  addressed  during \nimplementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on indigenous people.. \nHUD&PHED/PMU will continue to monitor the water quality of all phase I project \nschemes and the subprojects at 6-month intervals, particularly after the monsoon \nseason.

Districts  are  prioritized  following  a  formula  that  favors  brackish  and \nbarani areas. \n \nUsing applications for improved water supplies from communities in the project area, the \n2. \nconcerned  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  will  draw  up  priority  lists  of  subproject \ncommunities.  The  project  management  unit/housing  development  unit  and  public  health \nengineering  department  (PMU/HUD&PHED)  will  then  assess  the  needs  and  demands  of  the \nlisted  communities  and  their  willingness  to  participate  in  development,  management,  and \nmaintenance. The PMU will refine the priority list, carry out through its community development \nunit  (CDU)  a  series  of  meetings  in  each  community  on  the  refined  list,  and  prepare  feasibility \nstudies  in  consultation  with  the  communities.  Where  a  feasibility  study  meets  the  selection \ncriteria, HUD & PHED will seek approval of the related TMA to proceed with detailed design and \nconstruction. \n \n3. \nsubprojects.  \n \nB.  \n \nThe preparation of the list of communities requiring assistance will be based on current \n4. \npractice, to which new steps have been added to assess the willingness of the communities to \nparticipate in the Project. Three selection and screening phases have been devised to arrive at \nthe final list of about 750 schemes to be financed under the Project. \n \n \n \n5. \nTMAs  will  list  according  to  needs  the  communities  applying  for  water  supply  and \ndrainage  within  the  26  districts  and  54  tehsils  covered  by  the  Project,  and  forward  the  list  to \nPMU/HUD&PHED. The main criteria will follow: \n \n\nThe departmental subcommittee chaired by the Secretary, HUD & PHED will approve all \n\nPreselection of Subprojects \n\nProposed Selection Criteria \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe community must be located in a brackish or barani area. \nThe community must not have a water supply scheme. \n\n2. \n\nSelection of Subprojects \n\n \n \n \n During this phase, the PMU, in consultation with each community will assess needs and \n6. \ndemands  as  well  as  willingness  to  accept,  manage,  and  maintain  the  proposed  water  supply \nschemes.  The  main  criterion  for  preparing  the  refined  list  will  be  the  desire  expressed  by  the \ncommunity for a water supply and drainage scheme and their acceptance of capital cost sharing \nand responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the scheme (including costs) upon \ncompletion. In this respect, the community-based organization (CBO) will sign a memorandum \nof  understanding  (MOU)  and  deposit  in  the  joint  bank  account  with  the  PMU  an  amount \nequivalent to an estimated 2 months O&M expenditure of the scheme, as an initial commitment.   \n \n7. \nTrained CDU staff, comprising a team of one community development officer (CDO) and \ntwo  community-based  motivators  (CBMs,  one  male  and  one  female)  will  conduct  needs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nassessment  in  each  community.  The  actual  needs  and  expressions  of  interest  in  the  scheme \nwill be assessed through participatory socioeconomic surveys. The CDU staff will survey each \ncommunity using participatory techniques to determine, among others, population and number \nof households, household income levels, present sources of water, who collects the water, how \nmuch time is spent in collecting water, any cost associated with the present source, as well as \nresidents' willingness to pay for O&M of the scheme. \n \n8. \nThe CDU staff will also conduct open-ended interviews with key respondents to identify \nethnic groups and community leadership, institutions, and organizations; the community's self-\nhelp development experience; the residents' perceptions of the success or failure of the Project; \nand community\u2019s willing to assume O&M responsibility. \n \nThe likelihood of the scheme\u2019s success will be assessed based on the residents' ability \n9. \nand willingness to operate and manage the scheme, the level of social cohesion, and evidence \nof  a  spirit  of  self-reliance.  The  existence  of  local  organizations  that  could  undertake  the \nresponsibility, and a level of knowledge and skills related to water supply and drainage systems \nwill be positive factors in determining whether the community can be expected to be successful. \nTraining  needs  for  scheme  maintenance  will  be  assessed  and  recommendations  made  for \ntraining  the  community  members  before  and  during  subproject  construction  and  subsequent \ncommissioning. \n \n10. \nFor  a  village  or  cluster  of  villages  under  a  subproject,  where  a  pump-based    water \nsource  would  be  involved,  the  minimum  population  should  be  1,000  (1998  census).  This  is \nrequired  to  ensure  that  per  household  tariff  remains  affordable  to  the  communities  as \nexperienced in the phase-I project.  \n \n11. \nRegarding  rehabilitation,  only  those  schemes  that  have  been  abandoned  for  reasons \nsuch as nonavailability of  canal water, source failure, or completed its designed life would be \nselected.  However,  schemes  abandoned  due  to  nonpayment  of  electricity  bills  will  not  be \nconsidered  unless  the  community  pays  for  the  arrears.  Priority  will  be  given  to  schemes  that \nrequire  minor  rehabilitation  or  benefit  a  large  population.  PMU  consultants  will  determine  the \ncomponents of the schemes requiring rehabilitation.    \n \n12. \nFor  gravity-based  schemes  and  cost-effective  small  pump  schemes,  selection  will  be \nbased on all conditions defined in paras. 5-10. With regard to the population threshold, selection \nwill be based, not on the minimum population size but the capital cost ceiling as determined on \nthe basis of detailed analyses carried out during the preparation of the Project and reflected in \npara. 15.    \n \n \n \n13. \nThe  PMU  will  carry  out  feasibility  studies,  and  prepare  cost  estimates  and  Planning \nCommission Proforma-Is (PC-1s) for communities for which the need assessments indicate that \nschemes  built  under  a  community-based  approach  are  likely  to  be  sustainable.  The  PMU  will \nassist  these  communities  to  form  CBOs,  jointly  plan  subprojects  with  their  CBOs,  and  finalize \nthe  MOU  with  them.  Final  selection  will  be  based  on  the  findings  of  the  feasibility  studies  and \ncompliance with the following criteria: \n\nFinal Approval of Subprojects \n\n3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\nSuitable technical options have been explored and the availability of sustainable \nwater  source1  confirmed  through  adequate  investigation  and  field  tests  for  the \nappropriate  location,  required  quantity,  and  its  sustained  supply  of  water  with \nacceptable quality. \n\nA  least-cost  comparison  of  technically  feasible  options  has  been  prepared  and \nthe least-cost option is selected. \n\nThe community is willing to share in the capital cost of the subproject in cash or \nin  kind  as  per  established  criteria  of  4-7%  of  the  capital  cost  of  the  subproject. \nDepending on the socioeconomic profile of the villages, cost-sharing percentages \nand  options  to  be  used  for  the  Project  have  been  worked  out  during  Project \npreparation based on an extensive survey of various communities. \n\nThe community is willing to accept responsibility for O&M and is willing to pay for \n100% O&M expenditures. \n\nMaps,  plans,  and  typical  sections  and  details  have  been  prepared  to  scale, \nshowing the location, scope, and scale of the subproject; and a preliminary cost \nestimate has been prepared, and CBO has signed on the agreed-upon layout. \n\nAnnual  O&M  costs  have  been  estimated  and  tariffs  to  recover  the  costs \nestablished. \n\nService  affordability  and  householders'  willingness  to  pay  the  established  tariff \nhave been confirmed. \n\n \n(viii)  An  implementation  plan  has  been  prepared  showing  the  procedures  for  land \n\nacquisition, construction, and O&M. \n\nNecessary rights-of-way, water rights, and land requirements have been, or can \nbe,  acquired;  and  an  MOU  has  been  signed  by  the  communities  with  regard  to \nvoluntary  transfer  of  land  to  CBO  (See  attachment)  for  the  development  of  an \noverhead  reservoir  (if  required),  water  source  development,  water  transmission \nlines for wastewater disposal. \n\nEnvironmental \ninitial  environmental \nexamination  or  an  environmental  impact  assessment  has  been  prepared,  and \nmitigating measures have been proposed.  \n\nimpacts  have  been  examined,  an \n\n \n14. \nIf  a  subproject's  feasibility  study  meets  requirements  (i)-(x),  the  relevant  authorities \n(para. 3) will approve the subproject and the PMU will proceed with design and construction of \nthe  water  supply  and  sanitation  subproject  in  consultation  with  the  local  community.  Only \nsubprojects for which land requirements have been satisfied will be included in the program. \n \n                                                 \n1  The  water  sources  utilized  will  depend  on  the  circumstances  of  each  community.  Tubewells  will  be  constructed \nwhere good quality groundwater is available. Surface water sources, including springs, rivers, streams, and canals, \nwill  be  used  for  other  communities.  Typically,  simple  chlorination  systems  will  be  used  to  treat  water  drawn  from \ntubewells, and slow sand filters will be used for surface waters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nAffordability to the community and willingness to pay for its schemes\u2019 O&M costs will be \n15. \nan important factor in scheme design and service level. With the phase -I project experience, it \nwas agreed that for gravity based schemes, which are located mostly in mountainous areas and \nwhere  houses  spread  out,  stand  posts  and  water  tanks  will  be  provided  at  representative \nlocations in the villages instead of household connections, to make cost-effective subprojects. In \ncase of pump subprojects, however individual household connections will be viable in terms of \ntariff  collection;  however,  communities  may  opt  to  have  the  community  tanks  and  stand  posts \ninstead.  Further,  to  ensure  that  only  cost-effective  schemes  are  built  and  capital  costs  of \nsubprojects remain within certain limits, it was agreed, on the basis of extensive analysis during \nProject preparation, that the per capita capital cost of different types of schemes will not exceed \nthe following ceilings (2002 prices): \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nNew pumping water supply and sanitation (WSS) schemes  \nNew, gravity based WSS and minor   \n \nschemes assisted by NGOs \n\n \n\n \n\nPRs2,800 \nPRs1,400 \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nADB Involvement in the Approval of Subprojects \n\nADB's approval must be obtained before implementing any subproject that is substituted \n\n \nC. \n \n16. \nThe feasibility studies (including cost estimates and economic and financial justification) \nof  each  subproject  for  which  the  estimated  total  cost  exceeds  $300,000  equivalent  will  be \nforwarded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval before implementation. All other \nschemes,  provided  they  meet  the  selection  criteria,  will  be  constructed  without  prior  ADB \napproval, but the ADB's review missions will audit these schemes on a post facto basis. \n \n17. \nfor a subproject already approved by ADB. \n \nD.  \n \n18. \nOn  completion  of  the  construction  and  commissioning  phase,  the  consultants  will \nprepare a completion certificate after verifying that the subproject has been constructed as per \nagreed-upon  scope  and  specifications  and  there  are  no  shortcomings  in  terms  of  leakages  or \nwater  pressure  at  terminal  points.  Following  the  signing  of  this  certificate  by  CBO  and  the \nrelated  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  and  project  implementation  cell  (PIC)  staff,  and  \nconfirmation  of  the  community's  satisfaction  with  the  subproject  works,  the  certificate  will  be \nissued  to  the  contractor.

The  lists  of  tasks  that  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  and  union  councils  (UCs) \nare required to fulfill according to Local Government Ordinance 2001 are very long. Considering \ntheir limited capacities, the local governments cannot undertake all the tasks envisaged. To be \neffective,  they  need  to  focus  on  some  key  functions  while  outsourcing  the  rest  to  the  private \nsector. However, the autonomy of local government tiers in appointing and dismissing of staff is \nvery limited. As all senior staff appointments are carried out by the provincial government, the \nlocal  governments  cannot  ensure  staff  continuity  and  commitment  and  often  find  themselves \nhelpless to control the frequent transfer of qualified personnel.  \n\n1. \n\nCurrent Roles and Activities  \n\n \n\nThe  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)-related  functions  \u2013  on  various  tiers  of  the \n\n \n2. \ndevolved departments/agencies are summarized in the following table. \n \n\nWSS-Related Functions on Different Tiers of Government  \n\n \n\nProvincial Government \n\n \nPHED Monitoring and \nEvaluation Units  \n\n \nDistrict Government  \n\n \nTehsil Government \n\n \nUnion Councils \n\n \n\nin \n\nfour \n\nto  exist.  At \n\nFor  schemes  exceeding  PRs20  million,  technical  sanction  has  to  be \nobtained from the chief engineer of PHED at provincial level. \nUnder  the  devolution  plan,  the  administrative  divisions  have  been \nabolished.  Hence  superintendent  engineers  at  (ex)  divisional  level \nceased \nthe  province,  however, \nlocations \nestablishment  of  PHED  monitoring  and  evaluation  units  has  been \napproved.  Each  unit  will  be  headed  by  a  superintendent  engineer \nto  sanction  schemes \n(monitoring  and  evaluation),  with  powers \nbetween  PRs5million  to  20  million.  The  approved  locations  for \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  units  are  Multan,  Rawalpindi, \nFaisalabad, and Lahore.   \nUnder the devolved local government setup, district government does \nnot  have  a  role  in  the  WSS  sector.  However  in  the  tehsil  district \nheadquarters (i.e., the tehsil in which district administration is located), \nthe tehsil officer (infrastructure & services) is normally in Grade 18 as \nagainst  Grade  17  technical  officers,  Infrastructure  and  Services  (TOs \nI&S) in other tehsils of the same district. The TO (I&S) in TMA of tehsil \ndistrict  headquarters  plays  a  surrogate  role  of  the  (ex)  Executive \nEngineer (XEN) of PHED at district level.  \nThe TO (I&S) at district tehsil headquarters can sanction schemes up \nto  PRs5  million.  The  WSS-related  responsibilities  of  TO  (I&S)  of  a \ntehsil include \n\u2022  water supply  \n\u2022 \n\ncontrol  and  development  of  water  resources,  other  than  systems \nmaintained by the union and village councils \nsewage and sewage treatment and disposal \nstorm water drainage \nsanitation and solid waste collection and sanitary disposal of solid, \nliquid, industrial and hospital wastes \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nProvide and maintain public sources of drinking water including \n\u2022  wells, water pumps, tanks, ponds \n\u2022  other works for the supply of water \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMost  of  the  administrative  and  financial  management  functions  of  the  offices  of  the \n3. \nDepartment  of  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development  and  Department  of  Housing,  Urban \nDevelopment  and  Public  Health  Engineering-  which  were  providing  services  at  the  regional, \nzonal, circle, divisional, district, and tehsil levels- have been entrusted to the TMA, as the case \nmay be, along with the employees working in such offices. The current WSS-related roles and \nactivities of various tiers of government institutions are as follows: \n  \n\nLocal Government and Rural Development Department \n\n2. \n \n4. \nDistrict  Administration.  The  executive  district  officer    (services  and  works)  does  not \nhave  any  district  officer  for  WSS  under  him.  WSS  is  considered  a  municipal  function  and  has \nbeen  devolved  to  tehsil  level.  The  district  officer  (buildings  and  roads),  apart  from  other \nfunctions,  is  also  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitary  works,  but  limited  to  government \nbuildings and estates. \n\n5. \nTehsil  Municipal  Administration.  Tehsil  Nazim  is  the  head  of  the  TMA.  The  tehsil \nmunicipal  officer  acts  as  coordinating  and  administrative  officer  in  charge  of  the  four  tehsil \nofficers. The tasks allocated to tehsil officer (infrastructure and services) is to provide, manage, \noperate, maintain, and improve municipal infrastructure and services, including: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n\n \n(i) \n\nwater  supply  and  control  and  development  of  water  resources  other  than \nsystems maintained by the union and village councils; \nsewage and sewage treatment and disposal; \nstorm water drainage; \nsanitation  and  solid  waste  collection  and  sanitary  disposal  of  solid,  liquid, \nindustrial, and hospital wastes; \nroads  and  streets  other  than  roads  falling  under  the  jurisdiction  of,  and \nmaintained by, the district government or provincial government, and streets \nmaintained by the union administration or village council; \ntraffic  planning,  engineering  and  management  including  traffic  signaling \nsystem,  signs  on  roads,  street  marking,  parking  places,  transport  places, \nstops, stands and terminals; \nstreet lighting; \nfire fighting; \nparks, playgrounds, open spaces, and arboriculture;  \nslaughter houses. \n\n \n6. \nand cattle fairs and cattle markets. \n\nThe  tehsil  officer  also  organizes  sports,  cultural,  recreational  events,  fairs,  and  shows; \n\nUnion  Councils.  The  union  nazim  heads  the  union  administration.  The  deputy  union \n7. \nnazim  deputizes  the  union  nazim  during  his  temporary  absence.  The  union  secretaries \ncoordinate  and  facilitate  community  development,  functioning  of  the  union  committees,  and \ndelivery of municipal services under the supervision of the union nazim. \n\n \nWhere  there  is  more  than  one  secretary  of  the  union  administration,  the  distribution  of \n\n8. \nwork among the union secretaries is as follows: \n\nThe secretary for union committees is responsible for all works relating to the \ncouncil  meetings  and  the  work  of  all  committees  and  any  other  function \nentrusted to him by the union nazim. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n35 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  secretary  for  municipal  services  is  responsible  for  municipal  services \nprovided  by  the  union  administration  and  carries  out  all  other  functions \nentrusted to him by the union nazim. \nThe  secretary  for  community  development  is  responsible  for  the  community \ndevelopment work in the union administration, besides carrying out any other \nfunctions entrusted to him by the union nazim.  \n\n \n9. \nAmong  many  of  the  union  council  functions  listed  in  the  Local  Government  Ordinance \nare  providing  and  maintaining  public  sources  of  drinking  water,  such  as  wells,  water  pumps, \ntanks, ponds, and other works for supplying water.  \n\nB. \n\nFlow of Funds to Local Government Entities  \n\n \n\n \n\n10. \nThe  devolution  plan  has  decentralized  administrative  and  financial  authority  to  local \ngovernment institutions for governance, effective delivery of services, and transparent decision \nmaking through institutionalized participation of the people at the grassroot level.  \n \n11. \nSince November 2001, under the new system, the funds (Annual Development Program \n(ADP),  Khushhal  Pakistan  Program  (KPP,  federal/provincial  grants)  are  being  transferred  in \ncash instead of the previous budgetary methods. The funds are transferred from the State Bank \nto  the  district  provincial  account  in  national  banks  in  all  the  34  districts  of  the  province.  From \ndistricts, the funds are transferred to the tehsil provincial account in the national bank of each \ntehsil.  \n\nThe  allocation  of  development  funds  from  the  province  to  the  districts  is  based  on  the \n12. \nlevel  of  underdevelopment  of  the  districts,  determined  on  the  basis  of  a  criterion  prepared  by \nPunjab  Economic  Research  Institute  (PERI).  The  funds  transferred  to  districts  include  the \nnormal ADP budget, KPP (based on federal/provincial grants for small works at local level) and \nthe federal allocation in lieu of the abolished octroi.1 \n\nWSS Policy Implementation Capability  \n\n13. \nThere is no criterion to allocate development funds to tehsils. The same is true about the \ntehsil-to-union  council  flow  of  funds.  A  provincial  finance  commission  that  was  constituted  is \nnow formulating proposals for this purpose. Tehsils and union councils are currently generating \nrevenues  by  levying  certain  local  taxes  and  collecting  the  proceeds  from  transfer  of  property. \nThese  revenues,  however,  are  grossly  inadequate  to  fund  a  comprehensive  WSS  program  in \ntheir respective areas.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nLocal  Government  Ordinance  2001  does  have  a  provision  for  intertier  collaboration  in \nexecuting  development  projects.  For  instance,  TMAs  are  legally  bound  to  provide  technical \nassistance  to  UCs  if  the  latter  request  it.  For  small  schemes  initiated/identified  by  the  union \ncouncil, the finances are borne by the UC itself. However, because of lack of technical capacity, \nthe  union  administration  can  ask  the  tehsil  administration  to  depute  a  subengineer  for \ncosting/supervision of the scheme. If a scheme is beyond the financial capacity of the union, it \nsends  it  to  tehsil  requesting  approval  and  funding.  If  the  scheme  is  approved,  the  tehsil \nassumes the finances. At the same time, technical aspects such as site identification, costing, \ndesigning,  supervision,  etc.  are  also  handled  by  the  engineering  staff  of  TMA.  Funds  are  not \ntransferred to the union administration, but are spent by TMA directly. \n                                                 \n1   Octroi was a tax imposed on goods imported into the municipal limits for local use, sale, or consumption.  \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nSince  around  1990,  the  recruitment  of  graduate  engineers  through  Punjab  Public \n15. \nService  Commission  has  stopped.  During  this  period,  many  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment (PHED) engineers got promoted to higher grades, and some left the department for \nvarious reasons. The result, is a shortage of qualified Grade 17 engineers, and the void is being \nfilled by promoting technicians. Similarly many of the TOs (regulations) and TOs (finance) are \ninadequately qualified for their prescribed responsibilities.  \n\n16. \nIn  most  UCs,  the  secretaries  are  only  secondary  school  graduates.  Local  Government \nOrdinance  2001  provides  detailed  job  descriptions  of  the  UC  secretaries.  However,  the \nfunctions  given  in  the  ordinance  are  too  ambitious  as  against  the  present  qualifications  and \nexperience  of  the  secretaries  and  the  councilors.  There  are  no  specific  job  descriptions.  The \nordinance  describes  in  detail  the  functions  and  roles  of  different  units/sections,  but  the  local \ninstitutions have not yet prepared written job descriptions for the individual functionaries. There \nis  an  urgent  need  to  do  so.  Many  TMAs  at  present  are  in  the  process  of  preparing  a  new \nschedule of establishment for their institutions, but that may take several months to complete.    \n\n      \n\nThe  staff  in  different  tiers  of  local  institutions  came  from  different  departments  and \n17. \nservice  formations,  such  as  the  local  government  service  (LCS),  LG&RDD,  and  PHED,  and \njoined  the  local  government  tiers  recently.  Many  of  such  transferred  staff  are  still  drawing \nsalaries  from  the  parent  departments.  Most  of  the  lower  staff  are  from  the  defunct  municipal \ncommittees/corporations. There are problems of assimilation, shortage of office space, and lack \nof coordination, often leading to polarization and clique formation. In many TMAs, the staff of the \nex-municipal  committees/corporations  form  the  major  part  of  TMA.  Staff  transferred  from \ndifferent  devolved  departments  also  create  seniority  problems.  Some  reshuffling  is  required  to \nachieve a balance between the existing and the devolved staff. \n \n18. \nThe area of jurisdiction of the engineering staff of TMA is now the entire tehsil, and they \nhave to visit a large number of UCs. At present, they make visits at their own expense. This is \nnot justified, as apart from being a drain on their meager resources, it is also an inefficient and \nunproductive  way  of  getting  things  done.  The  movement  of  staff  remains  limited  and  they  are \nable  to  achieve  less  than  what  they  should.  Similarly  at  UC  level,  only  the  nazim  has  been \nprovided  with  a  motorcycle.  The  secretaries  are  not  (officially)  mobile.  If  the  three  proposed \nsecretaries  in  the  UC  are  to  fulfill  their  functions  as  given  in  the  ordinance,  they  must  be \nprovided with one motorcycle each.      \n \nD. \n \n\n  \nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building \n\n1. \n\nStructural Improvements and Staffing \n\n \n19. \nThe  critical  factors  for  the  current  reform  process  to  succeed  and  be  effective  include \nhuman  resource  development,  structural  transformation,  and  the  successful  implementation  of \nfiscal decentralization policies. Any local government reform process must embrace social and \ncapital investment strategies as part of the reform agenda. \n \nTMAs  and  other  tiers  of  local  government  should  have  the  capacity  to  manage  their \n20. \nnewly acquired powers. Capacity needs to be defined in a comprehensive sense and go beyond \ntraining to include staffing, rules, procedures, tools, incentives, promotions, and accountability. \nCapacity  growth  should  also  include  enabling  the  local  governments  to  enter  into  new \ninstitutional  arrangements  with  the  private  sector  and  NGOs,  and  to  expand  physical  capital. \nThe degree of autonomy and resources given to local governments is obviously one of the most \nimportant  factors  for  shaping  the  attitudes  and  roles  of  their  organs.  The  more  autonomy  a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n37 \n\nparticular  tier  of  local  government  has  and  the  more  resourceful  it  is,  the  more  service  and \ndevelopment-oriented  will  it  be.  Under  the  present  situation,  various  tiers  of  local  government \nhave attained varying degrees of autonomy. Nevertheless, they lack resources to discharge the \nresponsibilities demanded of them at that level of autonomy. It is therefore important to focus on \nlocal resource mobilization.  \n \n21. \nwork for the following proposals:   \n \n\nFor  structural  improvements  in  the  TMAs  and  other  tiers,  the  project  consultants  will \n\nAccountability and transparency.  Lack  of  transparency  often  leads  to  lack  of \naccountability.  Thus  citizens  must  have  access  to  relevant  information  such  as \nbudgets, accounts, plans, and all financial matters. Citizens must also know that \nofficials  who  violate  the  law  will  be  punished.  Consultants  will  help  TMAs  to \nreview and  compile all the above information for dissemination to the public for \nthe purpose of transparency in all financial matters. \n\nAlliance  building  and  coordination.  The  provincial  government  and  various \ntiers  of  the  local  government  should  see  each  other  as  partners  in  the \ndevelopment  process.  Structures  that  facilitate  dialogue  between  levels  of \ngovernment should be created. This is already true in the case of the union-tehsil \nand union-district relationship, as the deputy nazim of a UC is a member of the \ntehsil  council  and  nazim  of  a  UC  is  a  member  of  the  district  council.  However, \nthere  appears  to  be  a  void  between  the  tehsil  council  and  the  district  council. \nThere  need  to  be  associations  of  district  nazims  and  tehsil  nazims  so  that  they \ncan  become  reliable  partners  on  policy  questions.  TMAs  must  coordinate  and \ndevelop  communication  mechanisms  among  various  local  organizations  for \ncommunity-based integrated programs and long-term partnerships and a culture \nof  collective  action  among  local  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  and  the  CBOs  so  as  to  enhance  their  organizational  capacity  for \nefficient  delivery  of  local  services.  They  may  also  establish  networks  that  can \nprovide  a  forum  for  the  exchange  of  experiences,  ideas,  knowledge,  and \ninformation.  The  network  will  serve  liaison  and  also  articulate  the  perspectives \nand concerns of communities. \n\nfor \n\ntechniques \n\nCapacity  building.  TMAs  need  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  including \napplication  of  the  tax  on  immovable  property,  efficient  delivery  system,  and  \nmaximum  use,  operation  and  maintenance \nthe  available \nequipment. TMAs also must be helped in improving their financial management, \nincluding  budgeting,  resource  mobilization,  and  enhanced  O&M  of  TMA  assets; \nassessment  of  financial  obligations  of  TMAs  and  appropriate  improvements  in \ncollecting the tax on immovable property and tapping new avenues for increasing \nthe  TMAs  revenue.  The  local  governments  should  be  well-equipped  with \ntechnological  infrastructure.  The  consultants  will  build  TMAs\u2019  capacity  to  \nmobilize resources through an efficient collection of revenue, improved financial \nmanagement including budgeting and enhanced O&M of TMA assets; identify the \nlocal  government  needs  for  office  and  field  equipment  and  extend  appropriate \nassistance  in  procuring  them;  human  resource  development  through  the \nadministration of an objectively designed training program. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n2. \n\nHuman Resource Development \n\n \n22. \nHuman  resource  development  is  concerned  with  people  and  aims  at  acquiring  their \nservices,  developing  their  skills,  motivating  them  to  a  high  level  of  performance,  and  ensuring \nthat they continue to maintain their commitment to the organization.  \n\n \n23. \nProcurement  of  Services  (Staffing).  An  initial  review  of  the  situation,  under  the \ndevolved system, reveals that all the three tiers of government are adequately staffed (there is \noverstaffing at some places). However, there is a need to allocate proper functions and train the \nstaff in their respective function. \n\n \n24. \nSkills  Development.  Keeping  in  view  the  objectives,  target  group,  level,  and  course \ncontents,  Skills  development  can  be  grouped  into  two  broad  categories:  orientation  and  \nintensive training. \n\n \n25. \nOrientation  will  contain  information  such  as  project  background,  objectives,  selection \ncriteria, implementation strategy, role of stakeholders, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system \netc.  The  target  group  will  be  the  senior-level  officials/personnel  like  executive  district  officer \n(EDO), tehsil municipal officer (TMO), elected representatives, etc. The objectives of orientation \nwill  be  to  involve  the  key  players  right  at  the  inception  stage  of  the  project  and  to  equip  them \nwith  the  overall  concept  of  the  project.  The  orientation  session  will  be  conducted  in  clusters \n(grouping 3-4 tehsils).  \n \n26. \nAn  initial  training  needs  assessment  (TNA)  carried  out  under  the  PPTA  reveals  that \nintensive training will be required at different levels. The major focus would be at TMA level as \nTMA is the hub of all activities. In the devolved system, because of the reshuffling of staff from \nvarious ex-line departments, the concept of participatory approaches is totally new for most of \nthe staff members. Moreover, because of the transition period, the majority of the staff member \ndo  not  know  their  job  description.  The  findings  of  initial  TNA  and  project  implementation \nmechanisms suggest that training be conducted at three levels: TMA, UC, and communities. \n \n\n3. \n\nManagement Information System \n\n \n27. \nA management information system (MIS) is a set of interrelated components that collect, \nmanipulate, and disseminate data and information and provide a feedback mechanism to meet \nan  objective.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  an  information  system  is  to  provide  the  correct \ninformation to the authorized person at the right time, at the right place, and at the right cost. \n \n28. \nThe  proposed  MIS  is  a  computerized  system  to  manage  human  resources,  monetary \nresources,  raw  materials,  and  capital  resources  of  the  TMA  and  consists  of  a  set  of  people, \nhardware, software, databases, telecommunications, and procedures that should be configured \nto collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. \n \n29. \nAs regards the architecture of this system, a local area network (LAN), initially consisting \nof  one  server  machine  and  five  terminals  will  be  established  in  each  participating  TMA.  The \nserver machine in the MIS room of TMA and five terminals\u2013 one in the office of the TMO and \none in each of the functional units of the TMA\u2013 i.e. I&S, P&C, Finance, and Regulation\u2013are all \nconnected. Initially this setup will serve the local needs of information processing and sharing. \nVarious LANs established at each TMA will eventually be connected to the main server machine \nat the provincial level. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n39\n\n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n1995-2002 \n \n\nDescription \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nApproval \nDate \n\nADB \nPunjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project \nSocial Action Program Sector Project II1 \nNWFP Urban Development Sector Project Loan \n\n \n\n46.00 \n200.00 \n20.80 \n\nJapan \nMetropolitan Water Supply Khanpur to Islamabad \nBulk Water Supply Islamabad Phase-II \nKarachi Water Supply Improvement \nExploitation of Groundwater  \n\nIDA \nPublic Health Engg. and Rural Development Project,  \nKarachi Water Supply and Sanitation Phase-II \nPunjab Private Sector Ground Water \nNWFP Community Infrastructure Project \nSindh Special Development Program \nPunjab Urban Development Project \n\nUK \nKarachi Water Supply and Sanitation \nLahore Water and Sewerage project \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation, NWFP \n\nIDB \nGreater Hyderabad Sewerage 2109-PAK \nGreater Hyderabad Sewerage Equipment \n\nNetherlands \nQuetta Sewerage Project \nRural Water and Sanitation \nWater Supply through Hand Pump \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation-II \n\nUNDP \nFederal Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nRural Community Development \nArea Development Program \n\nGermany \nGround Water Financial Project  \nDrinking Water and Sanitation \nSupply of Drinking Water & Sanitation Chitral \n\nUNFDAC \nDir Area Development Project \n\n \n                                                 \n1 Includes a small part for rural water supply and sanitation sector development. \n\n1995 \n1996 \n2001 \n\n \n1995 \n1955 \n1996 \n1995 \n\n \n1999 \n1995 \n1997 \n1997 \n1997 \n1995 \n\n \n1995 \n1996 \n2002 \n\n \n1996 \n2001 \n\n \n1995 \n1995 \n2000 \n1998 \n\n \n1995 \n1996 \n1999 \n\n \n1995 \n1998 \n1999 \n\n \n1996 \n\n \n\n \n67.56 \n13.82 \n39.03 \n4.29 \n\n \n15.08 \n47.95 \n21.25 \n10.76 \n5.54 \n12.71 \n\n13.66 \n2.25 \n1.53 \n\n \n1.00 \n1.64 \n\n \n1.26 \n1.45 \n1.44 \n1.09 \n\n \n4.31 \n0.50 \n2.84 \n\n \n3.80 \n0.55 \n3.61 \n\n2.40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nDescription \n\nIFAD \nNorthern Area Development Project \n\nUSAID \nMohmand Area Development Project \n\nFrance \nSewerage Treatment Plant \n\nKuwait \nQuetta Water Supply Project \n\nEEC \nDir Kohistan Development Project \n\nSwitzerland \nCommunity Infrastructure Project \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nApproval \nDate \n\n2.44 \n\n \n2.25 \n\n \n7.47 \n\n \n0.55 \n\n \n1.67 \n\n \n\n0.53 \n     563.03 \n\n2001 \n\n \n1997 \n\n \n1999 \n\n \n1999 \n\n \n2002 \n\n \n2002 \n \n\n                                                                                              Total \n\n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  EEC  =  European  Economic  Community;  IDA  =  International \nDevelopment  Association;  IDB  =  Inter-American  Development  Bank;  IFAD  =  International  Fund  for \nAgriculture Development; NWFP = Northwest Frontier Province; UK = United Kingdom; UNDP = United \nNations  Development  Program;  UNFDAC  =  United  Nations  Fund  for  Drug  Abuse  Control;  UNICEF  = \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund; USAID = United States Agency for International Development. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n41\n\nLESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS PROJECTS  \n\n1. \nDuring  preparation  of  the  Project,  key  lessons  from  related  studies  were  analyzed:  (i) \nADB-financed  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  in  Pakistan,  particularly  the  Punjab  Rural \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project,  and  previous  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation \nprojects;    (ii)  regional  experiences;  and  (iii)  non  government  organizations  (NGOs)  projects. \nAppropriate measures are incorporated in the Project as follows:       \n \n\nLessons Learned \nTo  ensure  sustainability  of  community-based \nprojects,  it  is  essential  that  (i)  both  male  and \nin \nfemale  community  groups  are \nand \ndesign, \nplanning, \noperation  and  maintenance \n(ii) \ncommunity-based  organizations  (CBOs)  have \nenough capacity to assume their functions; and \n(iii)  CBOs  should  be  trained  in  the  early  stage \nof project implementation.  \n \n\nimplementation, \n\ninvolved \n\n(O&M); \n\nSubproject  selection  criteria  should  be  widely \ndisseminated  for  making  them  transparent, \navoiding  misinterpretation,  and  benefiting \nmajority  of  communities.  Communities  should \napply  for  funding  only  when  they  have  met \nsubproject  selection    criteria  and,  in  particular, \ncollected \nthe \nthe  cash  contribution \nsubproject cost. \n \n\nto \n\nCommunity  willingness  to  pay  for  services  is \noften  much  higher  than  expected.  Degree  of \nthe  extent  of \nsustainability  depends  on \nownership  and  community\u2019s  stakes \nthe \nsubproject.  \n \n\nin \n\nFor small rural WSS schemes, the local private \nsector  usually  responds  well  and  is  generally \n\n \n\nin \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nlocal \n\nthe  subproject  selection  criteria \n\nMeasures Adopted \nThe Project will involve male and female CBOs \nin  all  stages,  from  subproject  identification  to \nimplementation  and  O&M.  Training  of  CBOs \nhas  been  made  mandatory  in  both  the  early \nstage of subproject implementation and before \nthe  handing  over  of  subproject  to  community.  \nO&M  manual \nlanguage  was \nprepared  during  the  phase  I  project.  The \nGovernment  has  agreed  that,  prior  to  handing \nover \nthe  subprojects,  communities  will  be \nprovided  training  in  technical  and  financial \noperations.   \nThe  subproject  selection  criteria  have  been \nwidely  disseminated  due \nsuccessful \nimplementation of the phase I project and also \nduring  the  preparation  of  the  Project  through \nstakeholders  workshops,  so  as  to  make  them \ntransparent  and  facilitate  compliance.  All  tehsil \ngovernments have agreed that applications for \nsubprojects  will  be  invited  from  the  villages \nafter \nis  \nthrough  newspapers,  union \ndisseminated \ncouncils,  and  religious  institutions  (mosques). \nAs  part  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding \n(MOU),  communities  will  deposit  their  cash \ncontribution  in  the  joint  bank  account  with  the \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  to  have  their \nsubprojects considered under the Project.  \nIn  view  of  the  high  willingness-to-pay  (WTP), \nand  in  order  to  introduce  more  stakes  and \ncommunity  ownership  of  the  proposed  Project, \ncapital cost sharing has been included. This is \nbased on the extensive field survey carried out \nduring  project  preparation  and  positive \nThe \nfeedback \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  make  it  part  of  the \nuniform  policy  for  the  rural  water  supply  and \nsanitation \nis \n(WSS)  sector.  With \nexpected  that  the  sustainability  of  subprojects \nis  further  ensured  and  communities  will  select \ncost-effective options of subproject designs. As \nalready  practiced  in  the  phase  I  project,  no \nsubsidy  will  be  involved  during  O&M  of  the \nProject. \nIn  view  of  the  small  contracts  and  simple \ntechnology,  the  Project  will procure  goods  and \n\ncommunities. \n\nfrom \n\nthis, \n\nthe \n\nit \n\n\f \n42 \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\nand \n\nLessons Learned \ncost-effective.  Construction \nefficient \nactivities  should  be  properly  packaged \nto \ncapture  economies  of  scale.

The  woman  is  the  best \nperson  in  a  village  household  to  ask  about  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water  being  used.  The \nProject  also  recognizes  that  communication  and  interaction  between  women  is  more  effective \nthan  between  women  and  men,  particularly  in  the  rural  areas  of  the  Project.  Therefore,  the \nProject  will  actively  encourage  the  participation  of  women  as  both  beneficiaries  and \nimplementers. \n \n2. \nA  community  development  unit  (CDU)  was  established  in  the  phase  I  project.  The \nGovernment has agreed to retain that CDU for the proposed Project, which will be expanded to \naddress  the  extended  need  for  social  development  activities  in  the  Project.  A  successful \nexperience in the earlier project, is the establishment of six PIUs to implement the Project. For \neach  PIU,  a  team  comprising  a  community  development  officer  (CDO)  and  two  community-\nbased motivators (CBMs, one male and one female) will be recruited. The tasks for each team \nwill include identifying subprojects through a needs assessment survey, mobilizing community, \nforming  male  and  female  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  undertaking  an  awareness \ncampaign  with  beneficiaries  regarding  the  project  components,  and  defining  the  role  to  be \nplayed  at  each  stage  of  the  Project  by  male  and  female  groups  including  the  male/female \nelected  representatives,  following  up  with  the  communities  during  and  after  implementation  of \nthe  Project  to  ensure  community-based  operations  of  the  subprojects,  and  collecting  and \nanalyzing  data  for  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  To  monitor  women\u2019s  effective \nparticipation and training opportunities provided, a female assistant director for CDU,  appointed \non contract under the Project (Supplementary Appendix 1) will work with the female CBOs and \nthe female CBMs.     \n \n3. \nDuring social mobilization of the selected villages, beneficiary communities will be shown \nthe  importance  of  women\u2019s  participation  in  village  meetings,  and  in  all  phases  of  project \nplanning,  design,  implementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  also  the \nexecution  of  other  components:  hygiene  education,  household  latrine  construction,  and  the \nsocial  uplift  and  poverty  eradication  programs.  The  following  targets  will  be  achieved  in \nimplementing the Project: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFor  each  PIU,  a  team  comprising  a  CDO  and  two  CBMs;  one  male  and  one \nfemale, will be recruited \nTo monitor women\u2019s effective participation and training opportunities provided,  a \nfemale  assistant  director  for  the  CDU  appointed  on  contract  will  work  with  the \nfemale CBOs and the female CBMs.     \nBoth  PIU  and  CDU  will  emphasize  the  need  for  active  participation  of \nbeneficiaries in community meetings, which will have 50% women\u2019s participation; \n(iv)  Women  councilors  of  union  councils  (UCs)  and  female  CBOs  will  participate  in \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nsubproject planning, design, execution, and O&M. \nA  subproject  implementation  review  committee,  to  be  established  under  the \nProject, will include women councilors of UCs and tehsils, and female CBOs as \nkey members of the community; \nFemale CBOs and UC-level female councilors and lady health workers will play \nan  active  role  in  implementing  the  hygiene  education  and  latrine  construction \nprogram.  In  this  connection,  the  CDU  staff  and  the  project  consultants  will  give \nspecific  training  to  women  councilors,  lady  health  workers,  and  female  CBOs. \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  revolving  fund  for  latrine  construction  will  be  managed  jointly  by  the  male \nand female CBOs. \nThe  UC-level  social  uplift  and  poverty  eradication  program  (SUPER)  committee \nwill  include  female  councilors  and  female  CBOs  for  executing  SUPER  in  the \nselected  project  villages.  Of  the  target  beneficiaries  of  microcredit,  wherever \nfeasible, 60% will be women, especially the poor women of the community. \n\n \n4. \nThe  PMU,  CDU,  and  the  project  consultants  will  be  responsible  for  developing  and \nimplementing the appropriate strategies and action plans for the above tasks, using mandatory \nparticipatory approaches.

Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  proposed  subprojects  were  prepared  in \naccordance  with the Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB's)  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis \nof Projects, and the Handbook for the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. Economic \nanalysis  carried  out  on  10  typical  representative  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes.  Six  \nschemes  represent  pumping  schemes,  and  two  each  represent  gravity-based  schemes,  and \nrehabilitation schemes. The Project envisages construction of 750 schemes - 500 new pumping \nand  gravity-based  schemes  and  250  rehabilitation  schemes.  As  this  is  an  indicative \napportionment,  the  actual  configuration  will  depend  on  the  demand  by  the  communities  for \nvarious  types  and  size  of  schemes.  Nonetheless,  based  on  the  most  likely  configuration,  the \neconomic analysis has been carried out for (i) all the 10 schemes, and (ii) for the Project as a \nwhole. The analysis includes estimation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), average \nincremental financial cost (AIFC), average incremental economic cost (AIEC), switching values, \nand poverty impact ratio (PIR).  The assumptions used in the analysis are in Section B. \n \n2. \nAs  per  Government  policy,  only  those  communities  that  would  undertake  responsibility \nfor  the  full  cost  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  schemes  will  qualify  for  the  Project.  Due  to \nlimited availability of fresh water from alternate sources, the schemes under this Project will be \ndesigned  mainly  to  replace  the  existing  water  availability  with  safe  water,  with  some  provision \nfor incremental water deliveries, arising from both increase in demand due to population growth \nand induced water demand. For such schemes, the relevant per household tariff is based on the \nactual expenditure incurred on operation and maintenance (O&M) of the scheme. There will be \nno metering, and the water supply will be rationed at fixed delivery hours for each household. \nThere  will  not  be  any  quantity-based  progressive  tariff  structure,  and  each  household  will  be \ncharged a fixed monthly tariff.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n3. \nThe  economic  rationale  behind  the  investment  in  the  provision  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation scheme is in line with the poverty reduction objectives of the Government and ADB. \nThe communities that have poor access to safe drinking water are mostly poor and do not have \nthe capacity to invest in the infrastructure. Moreover, most of them are in small settlements with \nthe water source at considerable distance, requiring a large investment, beyond their capacity. \nHowever,  the  phase  I  project  has  demonstrated  that  the  beneficiaries  generally  have  the \ncapacity  and  are  willing  to  pay  for  the  O&M  cost  of  the  schemes.  In  most  communities,  the \nbeneficiaries have shown their inclination to contribute a modest share of the capital cost in kind \nand in cash.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAssumptions \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nAll cash inflows and outflows are priced in 2002 prices. \nOnly incremental costs and revenues have been accounted for. \nThough  the  project  implementation  period  is  4  years,  it  is  assumed  that  each \nscheme will be identified, designed, and constructed, within 1 year. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nEach scheme will have an economic life of 20 years, with no residual value at the \nend of the 20th year. \nPump and machinery will be replaced in the 16th year at a cost equivalent to that \nof the year of construction. \nThe real opportunity cost of capital is 12% per annum. \nThe annual production/delivery has been designed at around 40 liters per capita \nper day, with no provision for unaccounted-for water due to leakages. \n\n(viii)  The  house  will  not  be  metered,  so  no  allowance  has  been  kept  for  illegal \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n(xi) \n\ndiversions or free riders. \nThe economic analysis is based on adjusting the financial prices net of taxes and \nduties. \nBase costs has been used for pricing inputs. \nA  separate  provision  has  been  made  for  price  contingencies  and  physical \ncontingencies, where applicable. \nPRs60.00 is equivalent to $1.   \n\n(xii) \n(xiii)  The standard conversion factor (SCF) is 0.9. \n(xiv)  The  average  daily  wage  rate  is  PRs150  for  skilled  labor,  PRs100  for  unskilled \n\n(xv) \n\nlabor, and PRs60 for women. \nThe shadow wage rate is 1.1 for skilled labor, 0.8 for unskilled labor, and 0.7 for \nfemale workers (to reflect their opportunity cost). \n\n(xvi)  The population will increase at 2.5% annually. \n(xvii)  A  surcharge  of  5%  is  added  to  the  tariff  to  allow  for  replacement  costs  and \n\nemergencies. \n\n(xviii)  Women  spend  on  average  3  hours  in  fetching  water,  and  50%  of  their  time  is \n\nspent in income generating activities. \n\n(xix)  About  25%  adjustment  is  made  on  the  price  of  pump  and  machinery  to  reflect \neconomic prices (to reflect taxes and duties on the imported components). \n(xx)  Similarly,  a  25%  adjustment  is  made  on  the  material  costs  (such  as  pipes, \ncement  etc.)  to  reflect  economic  value  (to  reflect  taxes  and  duties  on  the \nimported components). \n\n(xxi)  About 20% adjustment on the electricity cost will represent economic value. \n(xxii)  The opportunity cost of water in alternate uses is zero. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEstimation of EIRR \n\n \n4. \nThe cost estimate for the representative schemes is based on schemes similar, in size \nand  service  area  coverage  implemented  during  the  phase  I  project.  The  estimation  of  the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  based  on  the  standard  cost  estimates,  both  capital \ncost and operating and maintenance cost, and derivation and valuation of quantifiable benefits. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n5. \nThe proposed project will benefit an estimated population of about 2.3 million, increasing \nto  about  3.2  million  in  20  years.  The  main  benefit  is  the  economic  value  of  the  time  saved  by \nwomen  and  diverted  to  activities  that  will  contribute  to  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the \nhousehold.  The  experience  from  the  phase  I  project  suggests  that  the  resultant  time  saving \nsignificantly  reduces  the  stress  on  women  and  girls.  With  water  supply  on  the  door-step, \nwomen\u2019s  contribution  to  farm-related  activities,  tending  live  stock,  and  other  off-farm  income- \ngenerating  activities  has  considerably  increased.  Moreover,  women  have  more  time  for \nhousehold  chorus  and  better  child  care.  Girls  who  used  to  share  the  burden  of  fetching  water \nare now able to attend school regularly.  \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 12 \n\n  \n6. \nIn  addition,  there  are  significant  nonquantifiable  benefits,  especially  health-related \nbenefits. Access to clean water has significantly reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases \nand  other  illnesses,  and  the  resultant  productivity  loss  due  to  absenteeism  from  work.  These \nbenefits  are  difficult  to  quantify  and  have  been  excluded  in  estimating  the  EIRR.  Similarly, \nbenefits, such as elimination of stagnant ponds that served as breeding places for mosquitoes, \nalso have not been accounted for in the economic analysis. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  is  based  on  the  traditional  with-  and  without-project  approach. \n7. \nThe main benefits that have been quantified are value of time saved in collecting water; saved \nvendor cost; and value of capital and O&M cost saved. The last two represent private cost that \nsome households incurred in maintaining partial supplies from existing sources.   \n \n8. \nThe value of time saved in collecting water is estimated as the value of the average time \nspent  by  women  in  collecting/fetching  water.  For  collecting/fetching  water,  women  on  average \nspend 3 hours a day. The normal wage for women is about PRs60 per day. Assuming 50% of \nthe available time is used in productive employment, and applying a shadow wage rate of 0.7, \nthe value of time saved in a year is estimated as PRs2,874.  \n \n9. \nThe  benefits  also  take  into  account  the  cost  that  households  in  the  without-project \nsituation would have incurred. This includes savings from capital and O&M cost of the motorized \nor hand pumps. \n  \n\n4. \n\nEstimated Parameters  \n\n10. \nTable  A12.1  presents  a  summary  of  the  AIFC,  AEIC,  monthly  tariff  per  household, \nestimated  proportion  of  monthly  tariff  in  household  income,  EIRR,  and  PIR  for  each  scheme, \nand the average for the 10 schemes.  AIFC for water supply and sanitation projects provides a \nmeasure  of  the  cost  per  cubic  meter  of  the  proposed  subprojects  and  the  tariff  needed  to \nprovide  full  cost  recovery.  AIEC  is  the  discounted  value  of  incremental  capital  costs  and \noperating costs (in economic prices) over the project life, divided by the discounted value of the \nincremental quantity of water sales. \n \n11. \nThe  average  EIRR  for  the  10  schemes  is  estimated  as  49.7%.  For  individual  schemes \nthe EIRR ranges between 20.3% and 110.7%. Across the schemes, the EIRR estimates vary as  \na  function  of  scheme  size,  distance  of  source  from  the  settlement,  population,  and  household \nsize.  The  EIRRs  are  higher  than  the  estimates  for  similar  schemes  in  the  phase  I  project  and \nsimilar  projects  elsewhere.  However,  the  previous  project  has  given  enough  experience  to \ndesign cost-effective schemes with higher returns for the proposed schemes than for schemes \nelsewhere with similar water deliveries.  \n \n12. \nTable  A12.2  presents  the  EIRR  for  the  project  as  a  whole,  including  the  management \ncosts and other noncivil work components. The estimated EIRR for the proposed Project as a \nwhole  is  about  43.8%.  The  figure  is  conservative,  as  it  does  not  include  benefits  derived  from \nsanitation improvements and health benefits. \n \n\n5. \n\nSensitivity Analysis and Switching Values  \n\n13. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  10  schemes  is  presented  in  Table  A12.3.  The  schemes \nare  generally  robust  and  insensitive  to  changes  in  the  cost  of  civil  works.  On  average,  the \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nschemes (except for one) can absorb more than 50% increase in capital cost. Even if the costs \nincrease  by  about  175%,  the  EIRR  is  still  about  12%.  The  switching  values  represent  the \npercentage  change  in  costs  and  benefits  that  would  set  the  EIRR  at  12%,  for  individual \nschemes, as well as for the average of 10 schemes. \n \n14. \nThe sensitivity analysis of the whole Project is presented in Table A12.4. The Project is \nrobust and insensitive to increase in costs. It can absorb more than 50% increase in costs and \n50%  decrease  in  benefits.  The  Project  is  also  viable  even  if  there  is  a  simultaneous  50% \nincrease in costs and 50% decrease in benefits.  \n \n\n6. \n\nDistribution of Economic Benefits and Poverty Impact Analysis \n\n15. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  all  segments  of  society.  The  main  beneficiaries  are  the \nconsumers,  especially  women.  The  investment  will  also  benefit  the  construction  industry, \nespecially rural labor. It is estimated that the Project will provide employment of about 130,000 \nperson-months  to  construction  labor.  A  few  laborers  who  are  working  as  water  vendors  may \nlose their job. However, they will be absorbed in the alternate opportunities out of demand for \nadditional labor for construction. Since the Project will not generate taxes, the public sector will \nnot be able to recover the investment. \n \n16.    The  PIR  estimates  the  proportion  of  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor,  and  the  flow  of \ngovernment expenditure to the poor segment of the society. In estimating the benefits accruing \nto the poor, it is assumed that more than 90% of the beneficiaries and the construction laborers \nin the proposed Project are poor. \n \n17.    The  poverty  impact  analysis  for  each  of  the  10  schemes  is  in  Table  A12.1.  A  PIR  of \nabout 0.67 shows that the poor will benefit both as consumers and as wage earners from the \nProject activity. \n \nC.  \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n18.  \nThe financial analysis is limited to estimation of the AIFC, and analysis of affordability by \nconsumers. Since the water supply and sanitation schemes will be operated and managed by \nthe users themselves, no utility institution is involved.  \n \n\n1. \n\nAverage Incremental Financial Costs  \n\n \n19.  \nThe  AIFC  is  the  ratio  of  the  discounted  costs  (both  capital  and  O&M)  of  measurable \naddition  to  the  capacity  divided  by  the  total  discounted  water  delivered  in  cubic  meters  (cum) \nover  its  expected  life.    AIFC,  as  incidence  per  household,  has  been  estimated  separately  for \ncapital  and  O&M  costs,  and  combined  costs,  to  compare  with  the  actual  tariff.  Table  A12.1 \npresents AIFC and AIEC for selected schemes as well as on overall basis. \n \n20.   AIFC  has  been  estimated  for  each  scheme  in  terms  of  incidence  per  household  to \nassess  affordability.  The  average  monthly  per  household  tariff  is  about  PRs72.  For  individual \nschemes, it ranges between PRs10 and PRs125. Gravity-based schemes have the lowest tariff. \nAIFC, as expected, generally is inversely correlated with population. The average AIFC is about \nPRs6.3 per cum. It ranges between PRs1.4 and PRs16.4. The AIEC is lower than the AIFC, as \nthe economic cost for most goods and services is lower than the financial costs. \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\n  Appendix 12 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nAffordability \n\n  \n21.    The  communities  generally  are  aware  of  the  Government  policy  that,  to  qualify  for  the \nschemes, they will have to assume the responsibility for postcompletion O&M. They will request \nassistance if they feel that the value of piped water exceeds the O&M cost. The experience from \nthe  phase  I  project  suggests  that  almost  98%  of  the  beneficiaries  are  willing  to  pay  and  can \nafford  the  tariff.  Although  reliable  data  on  income  is  not  available,  it  is  estimated  that  the \naverage  tariff  for  low-income  beneficiaries  is  about  2.3%  of  their  household  income,  ranging \nbetween 0.4% and 3.4%. \n \n22.    Although  communities  will  be  contributing  a  minimum  of  2% toward the capital cost, \nmostly in kind, some communities have indicated that they are  willing to  share up to 20% of the \ncapital cost. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nTable A12.1: Population, Number of Households, AIFC, AIEC, Monthly Tariff, EIRR, and \nPIR of 10 Selected Schemes \n\nScheme  Population \n\nNumber of \nHouseholds \n\nAIFC \n(PRs) \n\nAIEC \n(PRs) \n\n       5,211  \n\n         918  \n\n        8.11  \n\n        6.18  \n\n           59  \n\n       2,307  \n\n         435  \n\n      14.91  \n\n      11.36  \n\n         101  \n\n       1,611  \n\n         260  \n\n      16.17  \n\n      12.32  \n\n         127  \n\n       4,240  \n\n         621  \n\n        5.72  \n\n        4.36  \n\n           50  \n\n       1,845  \n\n         249  \n\n      13.29  \n\n      10.12  \n\n         125  \n\n       2,324  \n\n         402  \n\n        8.83  \n\n        6.73  \n\n           64  \n\n       2,056  \n\n         364  \n\n        1.35  \n\n        1.03  \n\n           10  \n\n       2,101  \n\n         262  \n\n        1.62  \n\n        1.23  \n\n           13  \n\n       2,107  \n\n         319  \n\n      11.22  \n\n        8.55  \n\n           95  \n\nTariff As \nPercentage \nof Monthly \nIncome of \nPoor \nHousehold \n\nMonthly \nTariff Per \nHousehold\n(PRs) \n\nBase Case \nEIRR (%)\n\nPoverty \nImpact \nRatio \n\n50.40 \n\n        0.67  \n\n30.07 \n\n        0.74  \n\n20.25 \n\n        0.66  \n\n49.56 \n\n        0.66  \n\n33.72 \n\n        0.70  \n\n52.77 \n\n        0.67  \n\n92.42 \n\n        0.65  \n\n73.62 \n\n        0.63  \n\n79.18 \n\n        0.66  \n\n2.39 \n\n4.40 \n\n4.76 \n\n1.69 \n\n3.89 \n\n2.56 \n\n0.39 \n\n0.37 \n\n3.32 \n\n1.96 \n\n       3,131  \n\n         476  \n\n        6.64  \n\n        5.06  \n\n           56  \n\n110.66 \n\n        0.64  \n\nAverage   \nNote: P-1 to P-6 are pump-based schemes, G-1 to G-2 gravity-based, and R-1 to R-2 are rehabilitation schemes \n\n       2,682  \n\n           72  \n\n         426  \n\n        6.29  \n\n        6.91  \n\n49.65 \n\n2.65 \n\n        0.67  \n\n \nTable A12.2: EIRR of the Project As a Whole (PRs million) \n\nYear \n\nConstruction \nCost \n\nOther \n Project Costs\n\nO&M Cost \n\nTotal Cost \n\n              -
