The  project  will  thus \nstrengthen  overall  road  sector  efficiency,  boost  connectivity,  and  promote  regional  trade  and \ninclusive economic growth, particularly in the western part of Kazakhstan. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nRoads  enable  connectivity  and  mobility,  which  are  essential  conditions  for  economic \ngrowth  and  development.  This  is  particularly  relevant  for  Kazakhstan\u2014the  world's  largest \nlandlocked  country  with  a  resource-rich  economy  and,  at  about  six  persons  per  square \nkilometer,  a  population  density  among  the  lowest  in  the  world.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  main  natural \nresources\u2014hydrocarbons,  oil, gas, ferrous,  and nonferrous metals\u2014are unevenly  spread over \nthe  country  and  remain  largely  untapped  because  of  infrastructure  constraints.  Landlocked \ncountries  suffer  most  from  high  transport  costs,  which  can  be  much  higher  than  the  tariffs  on \nimported  and  exported  goods.  A World  Bank  study  estimated  that  transport  costs  account  for \n8%\u201311% of the final cost of goods\u2014almost double the cost for most industrialized countries.4 As \nsuch, the development of transport infrastructure, together with sector efficiency improvements, \ncan  play  a  catalytic  role  in  the  sustainable  social  and  economic  development  of  the  country. \nContinued  public  sector  investments  are  needed  to  modernize  the  infrastructure  base,  which \nstrongly correlates with economic diversification and more robust growth.5 \n \n4. \nThe Government of Kazakhstan has been upgrading its national transport system since \n2007, to better integrate Kazakhstan into the world economy. This includes the reconstruction of \nthe 2,787 km Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) international transit \ncorridor (also known as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation [CAREC] corridors 1b \nand  6b,c)  to  improve  its  efficiency  and  effectiveness. 6  The  country  is  already  capturing  a \nsignificant  volume  of  transit  traffic  through  roads  and  railways.7 Strategically,  Kazakhstan  has \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, \n\n2016\u20132018. Manila. \n\n3  The  project  road  is  part  of  the  Trans-Caspian  Sea  Transit  Corridor  Baku\u2013Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktobe\u2013Aktau\u2013\nTurkmen border, which connects Kazakhstan with Azerbaijan and Europe in the west, with the Russian Federation \nin the north, and with Turkmenistan in the south. It also connects the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)  Corridor  1b  at  Aktobe  and  Corridor  6a  at  Makat,  providing  further  access  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC) and Southeast Asia. \n\n4  World Bank. 2012.

No. 231. Manila: ADB. \n\n6  The project costs about $6.5 billion and is mainly cofinanced by ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the Islamic Development Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. \n7  For instance, in 2012, the total volume of goods in transit through Kazakhstan was 17.8 million tons by road and \nrail,  income  from  which  totaled  more  than $1  billion.  Nevertheless,  revenues  are still  low,  affecting  cost  recovery \nand reinvestment capabilities. \n\n \n\n\fmuch potential to link the East Asia countries with Europe by road and rail, and through inland \nshipping along the Caspian Sea. \n \n5. \nWith  oil  prices  tumbling  since  2014  and  lower  external  demand  slowing  the  economy, \nKazakhstan responded with a new economic anti-crisis program. The President, in his address \nto the nation on 11 November 2014, announced Kazakhstan's Infrastructure Development State \nProgram (IDSP)\u2014Nurly Zhol\u2014for 2015\u20132019. To enable a favorable environment for business-\ndriven  regional  economic  integration,  among  others,  the  IDSP  prioritizes  domestic  transport \nlinks of strategic importance and regional impact, and connects the national capital, Astana, with \nother  \u201curban  agglomerations\u201d  and/or  \u201csecond-tier  cities\u201d  in  the  eastern,  western,  and  southern \nparts  of  the  country. 8  Accordingly,  the  government,  aided  by  development  partners,  is \naccelerating the development of the Center South (Astana\u2013Almaty), Center East (Astana\u2013Ust'\u2013\nKamenogorsk),  and  Center  West  (Astana\u2013Aktau)  corridors.  The  program  will  be  implemented \nfrom 2016 to 2020. The overall IDSP is expected to generate a significant number of new jobs \nand incomes through public investments. \n \nThe  existing  Aktobe\u2013Makat  road  is  a  two-lane  national  road  originally  designed  to \n6. \ncategories  III  and  IV  standard,  and  connects  the  CAREC  corridors  1b  and  6a,  as  well  as  the \ncapitals and administrative centers of the oil- and mineral-rich provinces of Aktobe and Atyrau, \nwhere  approximately  1.7 million  people live.  Most  of the  existing  road  pavement  is  either  non-\nexistent  or  damaged  to  the  extent  that  ordinary  passenger  cars  cannot  move  faster  than  30 \nkm/hour.  As  a  result,  many  vehicles  divert  off  the  road  and  travel  on  parallel  dirt  paths.  This \nlargely  deters  both  passenger  and  freight  operation  from  using  the  road.  Many  passengers \ntraveling between Aktobe and Atyrau have to use infrequent railway services instead, and much \ngoods  traffic  is  diverted  to  the  northern  Aktobe\u2013Oral\u2013Atyrau  route,  but  the  detour  takes  more \ntime needed with an additional distance of 360 km. Poor road connectivity has  also become a \nkey social issue contributing to the growing income disparity between rural and urban areas. \n \nThe  project  will  reconstruct  and  upgrade about  299 km  of  a  deteriorated section  of  the \n7. \nAktobe\u2013Makat  road.  In  parallel,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  will  reconstruct  and \nupgrade additional 153 km section along the same road. The project will help establish efficient \ntransport  links  by  reducing  transport  time  and  costs.  It  will  (i)  improve  in-country  transport \nservices,  particularly  linking  Astana  and  Aktobe  with  the  major  oil  city  of  Atyrau  and  the \ncountry\u2019s  only  international  port  of  Aktau;  (ii)  facilitate  regional  trade  and  link  the  growing \nmarkets  of  the  East  Asia  countries  with  Caspian  Sea  countries  further  to  Europe;  and \n(iii)  open  new  trade  and  business  opportunities  and  support  poverty  reduction  by  raising  the \nliving standard of the local population. \n \nSince 2006, the road sector in Kazakhstan has made strides in institutional and capacity \n8. \ndevelopment  supported  by  assistances \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  and  the \nWorld  Bank.  These  assistances  have  been  focusing  on  (i)  separating  planning  and \nmanagement from implementation of road works; (ii) development of a road asset management \nsystem;  (iii)  introduction  of  results-based  planning  and  monitoring,  and  modern  transport \ninformation  technologies;  (iv)  institutionalizing  road  safety  audits;  (v)  enforcing  traffic  overload \ncontrol; and (vi) expanding toll road operations. These interventions have been largely effective \n                                                \n8  The  Kazakhstan  Program  for  Regional  Development\u2014a  mechanism  for  predictive  spatial  development  of \nKazakhstan up to 2020\u2014focuses on developing the centers of economic growth (\u201curban agglomerations\u201d of Almaty \nand  Astana  and  14  \u201csecond-tier  cities\u201d)  to  improve  the  country\u2019s  economic  potential  and  the  living  conditions  in \nregional  Kazakhstan.  An  identified  challenge  for  the  program  is  the  development  of  critical  engineering \ninfrastructure, including that required for connectivity within and between the regions, i.e., transport systems. \n\nfrom  development  partners,  mainly \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fas  a  result  of  close  and  effective  coordination  and  collaboration  among  the  development \npartners  and  good  government  ownership.  As  the  government  embarks  on  the  next  stage  of \nroad  network  upgrades,  efficient  utilization  of  road  assets  and  further  reducing  transport  cost \nbecome crucial. The project will support government to improve communication throughout the \nstrategic  road  network  by  strengthening  the  transport  information  system.  This  system  will \nprovide timely road condition and traffic information to road administrators and road users, so as \nto leading safer, better, and more efficient movements of goods and people. \n \nThe  State  Program  for  the  Development  and  Integration  of  Transport  Infrastructure  to \n9. \n2020 (Transport Strategy 2020) was adopted by the government on 13 January 2014. It aims to \nform a modern transport system in Kazakhstan that (i) increases the flow of freight through the \ncountry  by  properly  integrating  and  linking  land,  sea,  and  air  transport  systems;  (ii)  provides \nconnectivity between regional cities and towns; and (iii) allows the development of infrastructure \ncenters  within  regions.  The  project  also  forms  a  key  part  of  the  Center  West  Corridor,  a  high \ngovernment  priority  featured  in  the  IDSP.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132016,9 and fully in line with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020.10 It  supports  the  CAREC Transport  and Trade  Facilitation Strategy  2020.11 The \nproject  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Kazakhstan,  2016\u20132018 \n(footnote 2). \n \nADB\u2019s  assistance  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  transport  sector  has  been  overall  successful.  The \n10. \nperformance of ADB\u2019s ongoing portfolio of projects is satisfactory. Its disbursement and contract \naward  ratios  are  above  ADB-wide  averages.  The  preparation  of  the  project  has  taken  into \nconsideration  of  ADB  and  other  development  partner\u2019s  experience  and  lessons  learned  in  the \nsector:  (i)  provide  quality  consulting  services  for  project  coordination  and  construction \nsupervision;  (ii)  streamline  the  role  of  various  road  sector  agencies, 12 and  strengthen  their \nproject  implementation  and  monitoring  capacities;  and  (iii) develop  synergy  with  other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe impact will be aligned with government\u2019s Transport Strategy 2020 aiming to form a \nmodernized transport system with increased freight transit, improved network connectivity, and \ncreation  of  infrastructure  centers.  The  outcome  will  be \nimproved  network  operational \nperformance, increased transit potential, and improved social and economic development of the \nwestern region of Kazakhstan in particular. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  project  outputs  will  be:  (i)  reconstruction  of  approximately  299  km  of  highway \nbetween  Aktobe  and  Makat,  and  (ii)  improvements  to  transport  system  operations  with  better \nprovision of road traffic safety and logistics effectiveness. \n \n13. \nRoad upgrade. Taking into account traffic demands and estimated road works cost, the \n299 km project road (between Km 156 and Km 500) is proposed to remain two lanes as now, \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012.

The project will include road \nsafety  measures  such  as  road  signs,  lane  markings,  lighting,  rest  areas,  bus  stops,  and \nsidewalks, and conduct a gender-sensitive road-safety-awareness campaign. To achieve better \nsustainability,  maintenance  equipment  will  also  be  procured  under  the  project.  The  equipment \nwill allow quick responses to traffic disruptions caused by natural disasters. \n \nImprovements to transport system operations. This component is a logical follow-up \n14. \non  the  scoping study14 of the  intelligent  transport system  completed  in 2012  and supported  by \nADB.  It  aims  to  establish  a  single  platform  for  monitoring  and  coordinating  transport \ninfrastructure  usage  and  develop  implementation  plans  for  selected  subsystems  (e.g.,  road \ncondition  and  weather  reporting,  freight  vehicle  tracking,  and  traffic  safety  monitoring).

However,  both  parties  have  agreed,  through  a  minutes  of  meeting  signed  on \n20 November  2015,  respective  responsibilities \nterms  of  coordination,  exchange  of \ninformation, and overall implementation of the respective portions of the Aktobe\u2013Makat road. \n \n\nin \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n   Ordinary capital resources \nGovernment of Kazakhstan \n \nSources: Ministry of Investments and Development and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n240.3 \n42.7 \n283.0 \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nTotal \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n84.9 \n15.1 \n100.0 \n\n18. \nThe Ministry of Investments and Development (MID)  will be the executing agency. The \nCommittee of Roads (COR) under MID will be the implementing agency with direct responsibility \nfor  overall  project  implementation.  COR  has  implemented  eight  ADB-assisted  road  projects \nsince  2008.  Its  project  delivery  performance  has  been  satisfactory,  and  its  staff  has  adequate \ntechnical skills and understanding of ADB procedures to manage the project. COR will engage, \nusing  government  counterpart  funds,  JSC  Kazavtozhol  as  the  project  management  consultant \n(PMC)  firm,  which  will  comprise  qualified  international  and  national  consultants  acceptable  to \nADB, and also coordinate the implementation of the IDB-financed Aktobe\u2013Makat road section. \nConsultants for the construction supervision and the transport information system to be financed \nunder  the  ADB  loan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consultants  will  assist  COR  with \nprocurement  and  contract  execution,  safeguard  monitoring,  institutional  capacity  development, \ninteragency coordination, and other project implementation functions. Procurement of civil works \nand  equipment  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended from  time to  time) \nand ADB\u2019s prior review. \n \n19. \nAdvance actions in line with ADB\u2019s procurement and consulting guidelines were taken to \nexpedite  preconstruction  works  and  avoid  initial  implementation  delays.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM).16  \n\n                                                \n15 The financing charges during implementation will not be capitalized in the loan and will be paid separately by the \n\ngovernment.

The road will be designed to boost safety by eliminating \nhazardous curves and improving the road geometry. Road markings, traffic signs, traffic signal \ncontrols at junctions, and road furniture necessary to improve road safety will be installed on the \nproject road. Rest areas along the road will also be constructed. Material investigations will be \ncarried out at potential borrow pits in the vicinity of the project road, using to the extent possible \nlocally  available  coarse  and  fine  aggregates  for  subbase,  base,  and  wearing  course.  The \nsustainability  and  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  operations  along  the  project  road  will  be \nenhanced  by  using  modern  road  maintenance  equipment  that  will  be  procured  for  local  road \nmaintenance  departments,  and  by  maximizing  the  use  of  local  construction  materials.  Project \ndesign  elements,  such  as  heightened  embankments,  additional  culvert  system  and  modified \nasphalt  concrete  mixtures,  will  help  mitigate  expected  climate  risks  including  snow  loading \nduring winter and high ambient temperature during summer. \n \n21. \nRoad  operations  and  traffic  management  require  reliable  and  accurate  data  on  all \naspects  of  the  network.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  current  system  in  this  regard  is  deficient.  Advance-\nwarning  information  systems  necessary  to  handle axle load monitoring and  controls  are  not  in \nplace.  In  addition,  road weather  information,  highway  advisory  radio  and  electronic  signs,  and \ntraffic  records  are  still  sporadic.  Such  information  is  essential  for,  among  others,  winter  road \nmaintenance\u2014to ensure that road restrictions are minimized and costs are kept low. Rectifying \nthese  problems  requires  modern  information  technology.  The  transport  information  system  for \nnonurban transport in Kazakhstan is at an early stage of development\u2014a pilot application was \nintroduced  in 2013  on the  211 km  Astana\u2013Shchuchinsk toll  road,  which features  closed-circuit \ntelevision, variable message signs, and a road weather information system. Feedback from road \nusers  and  transport  operators  has  been  positive,  and  areas  for  improvement  were  identified. \nExpanding the transport information system to the remaining road network will bring the benefits \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fof  greater  road  safety,  better  logistics  effectiveness,  enhanced  mobility  and  convenience,  and \npositive impacts on the environment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n22. \nThe  economic  evaluation  was undertaken  in accordance  with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects. 17 The  main  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  (i)  users  of  the \nexisting substandard road between Makat and Aktobe; (ii) those traveling between Atyrau and \nAktobe,  who  are  currently  routed  via  Uralsk  but  will  use  the  more  direct  route  via  Makat  after \nproject opening; and (iii) additional road users, which the upgraded road network will be able to \naccommodate. The project\u2019s main benefits are lower vehicle operating costs and reductions in \ntravel  time.  The  project  has  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  18.8%,  and  a  net  present \nvalue of $126.3 million at a 12% discount rate, and therefore is economically viable. \n \n23. \nThe  project  is  not generating  net  revenue  because  no  immediate plan  exists  to toll  the \nproject  road  upon  its  completion.  Nationwide,  the  annual  repair  and  maintenance  budget  has \nincreased  significantly  since  2012.  The  legacy  maintenance  backlog  was  gradually  cleared \nthanks  to  the  annual  maintenance  carried  out  and  the  expansion  of  the  reconstruction  and/or \nrehabilitation  program  since  2007.  To  mobilize  more  resources  for  maintenance,  the \ngovernment  has  started  levying  tolls  on  selected  main  road  corridors.  The  government  has \ncommitted to allocating sufficient budget for operation and maintenance of the project road after \ncompletion,  which  is  covenanted  in  the  loan  agreement.  Kazakhstan\u2019s  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed  external  debt  is  projected  to  rise  slightly,  from  the  equivalent  of  10.3%  of  gross \ndomestic  product  at  the  end  of  2015  to  10.6%  at  the  end  of  2017,  which  is  still  low  by \ninternational standards. It is unlikely that this project will have a significant impact on public and \npublicly  guaranteed external  debt. It should be  noted, however,  that  Kazakhstan  is suffering a \nperiod of fiscal insecurity due to volatile exchange rates and significantly reduced oil revenues, \nwhich  are  having  an  effect  on  government  budgets.  Given  current  financial  and  economic \nuncertainty,  the  expansion  of  tolls  to  selected  national  roads  will  be  implemented  in  a  gradual \nmanner. The plan is to increase the current length of tolled roads from 211 km in 2015 to 6,911 \nkm in 2022. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nThe  capacity  of  MID  and  COR  for  financial  management  and  procurement,  and  for \nimplementing  the  project,  was  assessed  and  found  to  be  adequate.  MID,  through  COR, \nmaintains  separate  project  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  works,  goods,  and \nservices financed from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred \nfor  the  project,  and  use  of  local  funds,  including  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial \nreporting arrangements. All bidding documents for the civil works contract will include provisions \nspecifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  all  project  records  and  accounts,  as  well  as  those  of  all \ncontractors, suppliers, and other service providers as they relate to the project. Key measures to \nensure proper governance are (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, \nand financial statements;18 (ii) transparent decision processes for all procurement matters; and \n(iii)  verification  of  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervision  consultant  and  oversight  by \nthe project implementation agency. \n \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 1997.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe  project  is  a  general  intervention.  It  does  not  specifically  address  poverty  reduction \nthrough standard direct actions at the level of households, or involve specific services that deal \nwith  the  geographical  determinants  of  poverty.  Nonetheless,  the  project  will  have  a  positive \nimpact on poverty alleviation in the local communities along the project road. Reduction in travel \ntimes and costs will accrue to travelers. During construction, the project is expected to produce \npositive  impacts  on  local  employment.  The  key  gender  issues  in  the  area  are  high \nunemployment for women in an area dominated by mining work, and restricted mobility due to \npoor road conditions. Gender-sensitive road safety features will be included in designated parts \nof  the  project  route,  including  lighting,  roadside  rest  areas  with  separate  toilets  for  men  and \nwomen,  bus  stops,  and  sidewalks.  Advertisements  for  project-related  jobs  will  include  a \nsentence to the effect that women are encouraged to apply. \n \n27. \nCivil works contracts will be designed for the contractors to (i) comply with Kazakhstan\u2019s \napplicable  labor  laws  and  related  international  core  labor  standards  (i.e.,  the  abolition  of  child \nlabor, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, the elimination \nof  all  forms  of  forced  or  compulsory  labor,  and  the  freedom  of  association  and  the  effective \nrecognition of the right to collective bargaining); (ii) provide safe work conditions and separate \nsanitation  facilities  for  male  and  female  workers;  (iii)  provide  equal  wage  to  male  and  female \nworkers for work of equal value; (iv) provide employment opportunities for women; and (v) carry \nout HIV/AIDS, illicit drug, and human trafficking prevention programs in workers\u2019 campsites. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  B  for  environment.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  4  November  2015,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project\u2019s  public  consultations \nwere  conducted  from  April  to  September  2015.  The  initial  environmental  examination  and  its \nconsultation process established that there are no significant environmental issues that  cannot \nbe either totally prevented or adequately mitigated to levels of insignificance. It is expected that \nthe  project  will  have  site-specific,  temporary  environmental  impacts  during  the  construction \nphase,  such  as  air  and  water  pollution,  noise,  and  soil  erosion;  cause  traffic  disruptions,  and \nhave  occupational  health  and  safety  impacts.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in, \nand  will  be  implemented  through,  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP, \nincluding its mitigation and monitoring programs, will be included  in the bidding documents for \ncivil  works.  The  overall  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  will  rest  with  the \ncontractor. Construction supervision consultants will engage environment specialists to monitor \nthe implementation of the EMP by contractors during construction. The construction supervision \nconsultant will conduct a training workshop on environmental management for the PMC at the \npreconstruction stage. The PMC will appoint environmental safeguard specialists to ensure that \nthe  project  is  in  compliance  with  the  environmental  loan  covenants,  including  semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reporting, and the implementation of a grievance redress mechanism. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  B  for  involuntary  resettlement \n29. \nimpacts. Because only a limited number of agricultural plots are located along the project road, \nthe impacts will not be significant. All of the 17 land plots affected, totaling 557.09 hectares (ha), \nare owned by the state. Out of these, 11 plots (with an estimated area of 152.04 ha) are leased \n\n\fby  legal  entities,  i.e.,  13.80  ha  provided  for  short-term  lease  (up  to  5  years)  and  138.24  ha \nprovided for long-term lease (5 to 49 years). The total number of affected persons is estimated \nto be 11 (all legal entities\u201410 peasant farms and 1 limited liability company). All 11 leased plots \nwill be partially affected and do not have structures on the part of the land to be taken for the \nproject  purposes  (the  area  of  the  land  to  be  taken  varies  from  0.04%  to  1.65%  of  the  overall \narea of the respective plot). These plots are used as natural pastures and not for residential or \ncommercial purposes. \n \nA land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) was prepared to mitigate and manage \n30. \nall  associated  losses  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  the \nrelevant national legislation. The LARP was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2015. \nComplete  details  of  entitlements  for  loss  of  assets  and  land  are  provided  in  the  entitlement \nmatrix of the LARP. Additional provisions for displaced persons belonging to vulnerable groups \nare  also  included.  Proper  consultation  with  the  displaced  persons  on  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation,  and  with  the  general  public  through  ADB\u2019s  website,  was  undertaken  during \nLARP preparation. If, during detailed design and implementation, any modification or additional \nland  requirement  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified,  the  LARP  should  be \nmodified in accordance with the applicable laws referred to in the LARP, and prior approval of \nADB obtained before any further implementation. \n \nAll displaced people will be paid compensation in accordance with the provisions in the \n31. \nLARP.  The  land  to  be  handed  over  to  the  contractor  should  be  rid  of  encumbrances  before \nconstruction starts. An efficient grievance redress mechanism is in place in accordance with the \nLARP to assist affected persons in resolving any grievances and complaints in a timely manner. \nThe overall responsibility of LARP finalization and implementation rests with MID and COR. The \nconstruction  supervision  consultant  will  engage  a  resettlement  specialist  to  monitor  LARP \nimplementation.  The  PMC  will  appoint  a  social  safeguard  specialist  to  coordinate  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  tasks  and  to  monitor  LARP  implementation.  COR  will  submit \nsemiannual monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  road  is  located  in  the  settled  areas  of  Aktobe  and \nAtyrau provinces, which have no indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.  Therefore,  no  indigenous  communities  will  be  affected  by  the  project.  Accordingly, \nthe project is classified C under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and no planning documents \nrelated to indigenous peoples are required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.19 The  project  procurement  classification  is \ncategory  B.  Overall,  the  risks  are  deemed  manageable  by  adopting  mitigating  measures,  and \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nMake extra effort to monitor government loan approval and \nratification processes and collaborate closely with the government \nagencies. \n\nRisks \nCumbersome procedures for \nexternal loan approval and \nratification cause project \nimplementation delay. \n\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nCost overrun because prices of \nlabor, commodities, and raw \nmaterials rise more than budgeted \nas a result of high volatile \nexchange rates or project design \nchanges midcourse, e.g., to fund \nadditional activities to \naccommodate local content. \nLack of sufficient funds to sustain \nproject road maintenance \n\nMitigating Measures \nProject cost estimates are based on detailed design and the most \nrecent unit prices of similar civil works. \nContingencies are budgeted in the project investment to account \nfor any unforeseen factors. \nThe government assured to cover any further cost overrun with \ncounterpart funding, which is covenanted in the loan agreement. \n\nThe government has committed to allocating sufficient budget for \noperation and maintenance of the project road after completion, \nwhich is covenanted in the loan agreement. \nThe government requested to procure maintenance equipment of \nabout $3 million under the project to enable quick responses to \ntraffic disruptions caused by natural disasters. \nThe government has requested assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank to initiate a system of performance-based \nroad maintenance contracts, which aims to improve the \nprioritization and funding of road maintenance and improve \noverall network service standard. \nThe government has planned to impose more road tolls on \nselected main road corridors, an increase from the 211 km tolled \nroads in 2015 to 6,911 km in 2022, to finance road operation and \nmaintenance. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n34. \nThe  government  and  MID  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n35. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  and  MID  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n36. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$240,300,000 to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the CAREC Corridors 1 and 6 Connector Road \n(Aktobe\u2013Makat) Reconstruction Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 23.5 years, including a grace period of 5.5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n4 August 2016 \n\n \n\n\f \nImpact the Project is Aligned with: \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nA modernized transport system with increased freight transit, improved network connectivity, and creation \nof infrastructure centers (Transport Strategy 2020)a \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \na\u2013c.
