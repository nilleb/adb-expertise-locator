THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Context. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the coronavirus disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) outbreak as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.1 As of 12 May 2020, a staggering \n4,088,848 cases had been confirmed worldwide and the death toll was 283,153.2 In South Asia \nregion\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), a total of 88,415 cases have been confirmed as \nof 12 May 2020. The outbreak has escalated in its severity in South Asian DMCs. Within a span \nof a month, the total number of confirmed cases in South Asia region increased by nearly 10 \ntimes.3 The region\u2019s large population, high population density,  and regional and in-country \nmigration flows place countries at increased risk of rapid transmission. In addition to the health \nrisks, the COVID-19 outbreak has upended education systems and led to unprecedented loss of \nlivelihoods. Learning has been disrupted for over 375 million learners in South Asian DMCs due \nto nationwide school closures that have been in place since March 2020.4 Global shutdown of \nmost economic activities have led to earnings loss for domestic as well as overseas workers. The \nimmediate risks and disruptions are likely to continue for the foreseeable future until a vaccine is \ndeveloped and mass immunization is achieved. Immediate and continued support to South Asian \nDMCs  to  address  COVID-19  spread  and  strengthen  health,  education  and  social  systems \nresponse for future outbreaks is crucial as pandemics can have catastrophic short-term and long-\nterm effects on human lives, critical service delivery for human capital development and the \neconomy. \n \n2.  Health sector context and issues. While the South Asia region has made significant \ngains in improving health indicators, DMCs face common health system challenges that could be \nexacerbated during periods of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past 15 years, \nSouth Asian DMCs have registered improvements in average life expectancy, infant mortality \nrates and maternal mortality ratios. Despite these improvements, several challenges remain. On \nthe supply side, challenges include lack of trained health personnel, poor physical infrastructure, \nand insufficient coverage. For example, the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people is below 1 \nin  Bangladesh  and  India,  1.2  in  Nepal,  and  3.8  in  Sri  Lanka.  These  are  well  below  the \nrecommended number of 4 to 6 beds per 1,000 people.5 Moreover, many countries in the region \nalso lack coordinated mechanisms, capabilities, and systems for emergency preparedness that \nare needed to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. In a recent index of \nglobal health security for preventing and responding to outbreaks, South Asian DMCs ranked low \namong 195 countries.6 On the demand side, social and gender barriers to healthcare utilization \nbehavior and access to quality coverage also pose challenges across the region.  \n \n \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2020.

The COVID-19 outbreak threatens to further strain already stretched health resources and \nseriously undermine health systems in South Asian DMCs. Shortages of ventilators and personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) have already been reported worldwide. Moreover, the outbreak \nthreatens to disrupt continuity of quality health service delivery for conditions not related to \nCOVID-19 due to issues such as potential overcrowding in healthcare facilities, shift in provision \nof emergency medical services away from other health conditions, and disruptions in supply of \nPPEs and prescription drugs. Failure to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak given these \nexisting challenges could reverse the gains made in improving health outcomes and further have \ndeleterious effects on countries\u2019 health and human capital.  \n \n4.  Issues in education  and  social inclusion.  The  outbreak  has  imperiled  access  to \neducation and learning due to closure of schools and educational facilities. While South Asian \nDMCs have made remarkable gains in education access, low learning outcomes, low quality and \nrelevance of education, and inequities in access especially at the post-primary levels pose \nchallenges. As of 2017, 96.7 million children were out of school in the South Asia region.7 \nLearning outcomes and competencies are low and not commensurate with the skills demanded \nin a changing global economy. The COVID-19 outbreak intensifies these challenges in two ways. \nFirst, disruptions in schooling threaten to put more learners out of school and impair learning. \nSecond, uncertainties in the global economy and the future of work heighten the need for higher \norder competencies and ability to learn. These difficulties are compounded by poor digital \ninfrastructure in the region rendering virtual modes of education infeasible for most learners which \ncould widen educational inequality. About two-thirds or more of the population in Bangladesh, \nIndia, Nepal and Sri Lanka are estimated to be without internet access as of 2017.8 Even among \nthe few who can access virtual education, the quality of instruction and learning may be subpar \ndue to issues such as teacher inexperience with virtual teaching and absence of stimuli needed \nfor cognitive development and learning. Moreover, inequality in education may continue to persist \neven after schools reopen due to increased opportunity costs of attending school for children from \npoor households that have suffered economic losses. \n \n5.  The outbreak has also enhanced the need for expanded social protection and support for \ngender, poor communities, migrants and vulnerable populations as its impact is likely to be more \npronounced for vulnerable groups. While varying degree of social protection mechanisms are in \nplace in South Asian DMCs, there is a need for greater investment and coverage. For example, \npublic spending on social protection, excluding health, is less than 2% of the gross domestic \nproduct in countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, and India; and coverage needs to be diversified \nacross different subgroups.9   \n \n6.  The combined immediate and long-term risks to health, education and social inclusion \nthreaten to stunt human capital development. Therefore, a two-pronged approach to support \ncountries for enhancing their emergency response to manage the outbreak and strengthening \nservice delivery systems capacity and preparedness for future shocks will be required.  \n \n7.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented \nchallenges to many countries in the world, and most development partners are supporting \ndeveloping countries. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has also announced COVID-19 \nresponse program. In the South Asia Department (SARD) of ADB, new emergency support for \nresponse to COVID-19 outbreak in areas of health, social protection, and economic support has \n \n7  UNESCO. 2018.

Geneva. \n ", "3 \nbeen requested by the governments of Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. \nGiven ADB\u2019s long-term engagement in supporting health sector development and health systems \nstrengthening,  ADB  is  well-positioned  to  urgently  support  governments\u2019  response  and \npreparedness. Moreover, ADB\u2019s support to education sector initiatives in SARD countries will also \nbe helpful as countries look to mitigate the impact of disruptions in the education sector. The \ncountercyclical support facilities under the COVID-19 crisis response option provided to SARD \nDMCs  are  mainly  geared  to  protect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  populations  from  falling  into \ndestitution and saving lives from COVID-19 infection. ADB support to strengthen preparedness \nof health as well as education systems and protecting vulnerable groups in SARD countries in \ncase of future shocks will be critical for mitigating impacts on health and overall human capital, \nand to safeguard the developmental gains made so far.  \n \n8.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will (i) support the design of \nongoing and ensuing SARD health and education sector projects in aligning project activities to \naddress and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak; (ii) provide analytical support to inform \nshort-term and long-term actions, policy and ensuing projects to address the outbreak and \nstrengthen health, education and social protection systems preparedness for future outbreaks or \nsimilar external shocks; and (iii) support assessments to learn from ongoing COVID-19 responses \nin health, education and social protection to identify gaps and opportunities for accelerated reform \nactions to mitigate impacts of the outbreak and strengthen resilience against future disruptions. \n \n9.  Given  the  rapidly  evolving  nature  of  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  health  projects  face \npreviously  unanticipated  challenges.  Therefore,  support  to  identify  gaps  and  reinforcement \nmeasures may be needed. The following ongoing and pipeline SARD projects will be supported \n(i) Sri Lanka\u2019s Health System Enhancement Project;10 (ii) Bhutan\u2019s Health Sector Development \nProgram;11 (iii) Bangladesh\u2019s Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (Additional \nFinancing);12 and (iv) India\u2019s Comprehensive Primary Health Care in Urban Areas (pipeline), as \nnecessary.13 In addition to these projects, the TA facility will provide relevant support to inform \nprograms and policies to the governments of South Asian DMCs in strengthening education and \nsocial protection service delivery and building system resilience.  \n \n10.  Rationale for a regional transactional technical assistance facility. The regional TA \nfacility approach is suitable as it will enhance project design and efficiency for health projects, and \nsupport policy-relevant activities across SARD countries by mobilizing consultant resources to \naddress common issues faced by SARD countries in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak and \nstrengthening preparedness for future potential outbreaks. The facility will bridge capability gaps \nby bringing in international expertise not available in-country in areas of emergency response \nneeds assessments and planning, strengthening surveillance systems, education technology and \nplanning during emergencies, and enhancing learning, to name a few. The facility will also foster \nknowledge transfer across countries by creating synergies from using common pool of experts. \nIn addition, by supporting strengthening of a regional public good such as health surveillance and \nsystems, the facility contributes to regional cooperation efforts. Overall, this TA facility will reduce \ntransaction  costs  compared  to  resources  required  for  separate  stand-alone  transaction  TA \n \n10 ADB. 2018.

The  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department  (SDCC)  recently \napproved  a  regional  TA  of  $48  million  to  support  medium-  to  long-term  health  systems \nstrengthening in ADB\u2019s DMCs.14 This TA facility will complement the said regional TA of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department by providing tailored support for \nproject design and policy analysis to SARD DMCs considering regional and country-specific \nchallenges related to (i) emergency response to outbreaks; (ii) healthcare supply and demand; \n(iii) health, education, and social protection systems strengthening; and (iv) managing disruptions \nin social sector service delivery.   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Design  of  projects  and  activities  to  address  COVID-19  outbreak \nstrengthened. This output will support the design of new health sector projects and activities \nunder ongoing health sector projects to adjust for the effects of the outbreak (para 9). The \nactivities will include (i) health system assessments including supply side assessment of gaps in \nemergency response at the national and local service delivery levels based on global or regional \nbenchmarks in countries that have successfully responded to epidemics or pandemics; the \nassessment will also explore how the private sector could provide health infrastructure and \noperations support; (ii) healthcare demand assessments taking into account any effect of the \nCOVID-19 outbreak as well as social norms and gender barriers to seeking care; (iii) identification \nof gaps in maternal and child health, and nutrition due to the outbreak; and (iv) identification of \nkey areas for investment in health and ADB support.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Preparedness of health, education, and social protection systems in \nSARD developing member countries to respond to outbreaks strengthened. This output will \nprovide inputs to ensuing health, education and social sector projects to strengthen preparedness \nof health, education, and social protection systems in providing effective emergency response in \ncase of future potential outbreaks in SARD DMCs. For health sector, activities will include (i) \nreview of risks and health resources mapping; (ii) assessments of procurement capacity and \nrecommendations for developing flexible systems for procuring necessary supplies; (iii) technical \nsupport for strengthening response plans and mechanisms including systems for maintaining \nstockpiles of essential drugs and PPE, strengthening reporting, and improving surveillance \nsystems; and (iv) strategic advice for containing cases and managing treatment, including a \ngender-sensitive approach to providing treatment. This output will also support data analytics to \nexplore use of existing telecommunications data in managing testing logistics and treatments in \nepidemiological clusters. The data analytics will be implemented in Sri Lanka and Nepal. For \neducation and social protection sectors, activities will be related to (i) identifying approaches to \nensure  continuity  in  learning  across  subsectors  including  examples  from  low  infrastructure \nsettings or countries in crises; (ii) ways to improve learning, building self-direction, and nurturing \nsocioemotional skills in context of altered learning environments; (iii) informing strategies for \nincreasing trained health personnel in the medium to long-term; and (iv) enhancing social \nprotection activities and systems to curb inequities due to disruptions such as COVID-19. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge on evidence-based approaches for effective operations in \nhealth, education and social protection promoted. This output will support production and \nexchange of knowledge in health, education and social protection sectors gathered from ongoing \nresponses to COVID-19. Assessments of ongoing operations will be supported to inform ensuing \nprojects, and country-specific design and implementation of accelerated actions to mitigate the \n \n14 ADB. 2020.

Knowledge exchange activities \nwill be encouraged through seminars, workshops, and policy dialogues in DMCs, as appropriate. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA Special Fund ($666,667 from TASF-6 and $333,333 from TASF-Others). The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The relevant governments will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, secretarial and coordination \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. The governments have been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. In close coordination with the \nresident missions, the South Asia Human and Social Development (SAHS) Division will implement \nthe TA and be accountable for the outputs. The division will carry out TA administration, supervision, \nimplementation oversight, coordination with concerned government agencies, and communication \nwith consultants and stakeholders.  \n \n16.
