THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Inclusive Finance Development Program and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the Inclusive Finance \nDevelopment Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program complements coordinated support by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to develop a resilient and inclusive finance sector. The program supports the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to increase financial inclusion by (i) strengthening the institutional and policy \nenvironment, (ii) improving the financial infrastructure, and (iii) increasing the capacity and reach \nof service providers. The program is consistent with the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), \n2017\u201320221 and is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The  development  problem.  Despite  rising  and  sustained  economic  growth,  the \nGovernment of the Philippines faces a challenge of persistently high inequality. Sound economic \nstewardship,  and  an  emphasis  on governance  and  infrastructure  led to  an  acceleration  in \neconomic growth \u2013 which averaged 6.2% from 2011\u20132017, and a decline in overall poverty \nincidence from 26.6% in 2006 to 21.6% in 2015.3 However, the Philippines has one of the highest \nlevels of income inequality in Southeast Asia, with a Gini coefficient of 0.44 in 2015, compared \nwith 0.39 in Indonesia in 2017 and 0.38 in Thailand in 2013. The per capita gross regional \ndomestic product in the National Capital Region is the country\u2019s highest, and is more than 12 \ntimes that in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).4 In recognition of the \nchallenges, the PDP, 2017\u20132022 set ambitious objectives for inclusive growth. The rural poverty \nrate is targeted to decline from 30% in 2015 to 20% in 2022, and the overall poverty rate from \n21.6% to 14.0% during the same period. To achieve these targets, the government plans to create \njobs, increase incomes, and strengthen the investment climate. The government\u2019s signature \n\u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d program calls for $168 billion in total infrastructure investment from 2017 to \n2022. Spending on education, skills, and public service delivery has been increased and the \neconomy has responded, with economic growth further accelerating to 6.7% in 2017, the fastest \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations region.5  \n \n4.  While higher economic growth will provide a strong foundation for reducing inequality, \nmore needs to be done. High inequality in the Philippines is a result of several factors, but low \nlevels of financial inclusion \u2013 especially in rural areas \u2013 represents a key contributor.6 In 2017, \nonly 34% of Filipino adults held an account at a formal financial institution, compared with 49% of \nadults in Indonesia, 82% in Thailand, and 85% in Malaysia (Table 1). Only 10% of the adult \n                                                \n1  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017.

Lower-income \nhouseholds are disproportionally excluded, with only 18% of adults from the bottom 40% income \ngroup holding an account at a formal financial institution in 2017 (the same level recorded in 2014). \nAdditionally, regional disparities in financial access are substantial, with bank offices concentrated \nin highly populated regions such as the National Capital Region, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal \nand Quezon, and Central Luzon. As of September 2017, 35% of cities and municipalities did not \nhave a banking office.7 Taking nonbank financial institutions (e.g., microfinance institutions, \ncooperatives, pawnshops, and remittance agents) into account reduced the level of unserved \nmunicipalities from 35% to 10%, but these offer only a limited range of financial products and \nservices. As a result, many individuals have limited access to or are completely excluded from \nfinancial services, including savings, credit, remittances, payments, cash drawdowns, e-money \nconversions, and insurance. Likewise, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), \nwhich are typically owned by individuals, lack access to similar types of financial services. While \nsome indicators on access to finance indicate gender gaps in favor of women, 61% of women still \nlack a bank account at a formal financial institution. \n \nTable 1: Financial Inclusion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  \n(%) \nBorrowed \nAccount  Account   from a  Saved at a \nAccount  Account  Youth   Poorest  Financial  Financial \nCountry  Accounta  Male  Female  (age 15-24)   40%   Institution  Institution \nCambodia  22  22  22  20  53  27  5 \nMyanmar  26  26  26  11  30  19  8 \nLao PDR  29  26  32  24  42  9  18 \nViet Nam  31  31  30  34  42  21  14 \nPhilippines  34  30  39  24  18  10  12 \nIndonesia  49  46  51  47  37  17  22 \nThailand  82  84  80  73  78  15  39 \nMalaysia  85  88  82  84  81  12  38 \n  Lao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n  Note: Indicators are defined as the percentage of people aged 15 and over who have an account. \na  Number of people who have an account, on their own or with someone else, at a bank or another type of financial          \ninstitution, or have personally used a mobile money service in the past 12 months. \nSource: World Bank. The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution. \nWashington, DC. \n \n5.  Binding  constraints.  Recognizing the  challenges, the government  adopted  its first \nNational Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) in 2015 to coordinate broad-based initiatives for \ngreater financial inclusion. Based on an assessment of the 2015 NSFI and a stocktaking of \ninclusive finance in the Philippines, three primary constraints have been identified: (i) structural \nimpediments limit access to finance, especially for the rural poor; (ii) financial infrastructure is \nfragmented and does not provide an enabling environment; and (iii) financial institutions exhibit \nlimited capacity to expand outreach and increase access to finance.8 \n \n6.  Structural impediments. There are four primary structural impediments that limit access \nto finance: (i) lack of a national identification system (NIS); (ii) limited availability of agriculture \nfinance; (iii) low penetration of microinsurance; and (iv) shallow financial literacy. In 2017, 32% of \n                                                \n7  Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP). 2017. Financial Inclusion in the Philippines: Dashboard as of Third Quarter \n2017. Manila. \n8  Sector Assessment (Summary): Finance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "3 \nthe  population  reported  not  having  a  bank  account  because  of  a  lack  of  necessary \ndocumentation.9 Thus, a single NIS and an integrated national database represent a necessary \nstarting  point  for  accelerating  financial  inclusion.  International  experience  shows  that  the \nestablishment of an NIS, with a foundational identification card,10 can improve poor households\u2019 \naccess to government benefits and services by making it easier to open a bank account.11 In \naddition, the legal and regulatory environment needs to be strengthened to better encourage the \nfinance sector to provide the financial products and services necessary for individuals in rural \nhouseholds to generate income and mitigate financial risks.12 With 25% of employed persons \nworking in agriculture (around 10 million individuals) rural areas often rely on MSMEs and \nagribusiness for growth and employment creation.13 While agricultural lending increased 17% \nfrom 2016 to 2017, agriculture finance overall remains underdeveloped and underutilized. Banks \nstruggle  to  comply  with  mandatory  agricultural  lending  requirements,  preferring  to  pay  the \npenalties for non-compliance rather than allocate part of their portfolio to the agriculture sector. \nTransaction costs are high, especially in rural areas, and financial institutions lack expertise in \nmanaging agricultural loan portfolios. Crop insurance coverage is available only from government \nentities, coverage of risk is narrow, fragmentation of the market limits demand, and value chains \nhave not yet been developed. The number of farmers covered by the Philippine Crop Insurance \nCorporation in 2017 increased to 1,040,000, but less than 2.82% of actual total damages were \npaid out 2017.14 Finally, efforts to promote financial literacy have not been sufficient to ensure \nthat consumers, especially poorer households and MSMEs, can make well-informed financial \ndecisions. A coordinated financial education strategy and tailored financial literacy activities are \nnecessary to meet the needs of specific groups (e.g., women, farmers, fishers, youth, and \nMSMEs) and for specific types of financial services, including digital financial services. \n \n7.  Fragmented financial infrastructure. There are three primary impediments to financial \ninfrastructure: (i) an underdeveloped payment system; (ii) lack of comprehensive credit and \ncollateral data; and (iii) a lack of alternative credit enhancement mechanisms. Financial inclusion \nis best served through a modern, efficient, and low-cost payment system. However, the payment \nsystem is costly, fragmented, and cannot support the efficient provision of electronic payments to \nreach the underserved. Digital payments represented only 1% of total financial transactions in \n2013, demonstrating the lack of effective electronic delivery channels. Achieving higher levels of \nfinancial inclusion also depends on the ability of lenders to assess credit risks, and to compensate \nwith collateral if necessary.  A comprehensive credit reporting registry has been established. \nHowever, awareness of the registry among clients and financial service providers is low and \nparticipation is limited, especially for MSMEs. Moreover, the absence of a movable collateral \nregistry exacerbates the lack of credit data and inhibits bank lending, as banks are unable to \nmitigate their credit risk. While the government has a network of credit guarantee mechanisms, \n                                                \n9  The Philippines has multiple forms of identification; none are integrated, and none provide comprehensive coverage. \n10 A foundational national identification registry contains basic data which can be used for multi-purposes. \n11 For example, India has a biometric NIS with 1.19 billion enrolled members (as of 30 November 2017), and \napproximately 99% of households in both rural and urban areas in India now have at least one member with a bank \naccount, up from 50% in 2011 at the inception of the NIS.P. Bhattacharya. 2016. 99% Indian households are covered \nby  a  bank  account.  Mint.  9  April.  http://www.livemint.com/Specials/vVKbQ0cMmiNbdwOlfd0Z4N/99-Indian-\nhouseholds-are-covered-by-a-bank-account.html.  \n12 The agriculture sector represents 9.7% of gross domestic product and yet has a high unmet demand for more \nsophisticated agriculture and agriculture value chain finance (financial products and services supporting the full range \nof value adding activities required for bringing a product or service from the farm to the final customer or consumer) \nand crop insurance. \n13 Government of the Philippines, Philippine Statistics Authority. https://www.psa.gov.ph (accessed 3 July 2018). \n14 Legislation pending in Congress proposes to address weaknesses of the Philippine Corp Insurance Corporation \nthrough a recapitalization of funds and by allowing engagement in index-based insurance and reinsurance. \n \n ", "4 \nthe credit guarantee system is undercapitalized, inefficient, and underused. This weakness \nespecially limits the extension of credit to MSMEs, which usually lack collateral, particularly for \nagriculture finance. \n \n8.  Limited capacity of financial institutions. The limited capacity of financial service \nproviders prevents wider outreach and constrains access to finance, especially in rural areas. The \nmicrofinance  sector  has  approximately  1,400  operating  microfinance  institutions,  including \nmicrofinance nongovernment organizations (MNGOs), rural banks, thrift banks, and cooperatives \nserving about 7 million active clients. As of 2017, the banking sector alone had 164 operating \nmicrofinance banks serving 1.8 million clients with outstanding loans amounting to  around \n$279 million.15 Despite  this  growth,  MNGOs\u2014which  serve  the  most  excluded  populations, \nincluding  poor  women\u2014are  unable  to  meet  existing  demand.  With  the  passage  of  the \nMicrofinance NGOs Act in 2015, registered and accredited MNGOs now pay only 2% tax. The \ncost savings from the reduced tax burden can be translated into new product development, lower \ninterest  rates,  and  expanded  outreach.  However,  MNGOs  have  not  been  subjected  to  a \ncomprehensive regulatory structure, including social and governance performance standards and \nregular monitoring, which would ensure their financial sustainability and better protect their clients. \nRural banks, which are best placed to reach MSMEs and agricultural enterprises in rural areas, \nalso exhibit limited financial and operational capacity. Without cost-effective credit assessment or \nenhancement mechanisms, most rural banks limit their risk exposure, resulting in lower outreach. \nFinancial technology has the potential to rapidly expand and scale financial services. However, \nmost financial institutions lack the financial resources or ability to innovate. Finally, gaps in the \nlegal and regulatory framework for Islamic finance have slowed development of Islamic financial \nservices, particularly in the ARMM, limiting financial inclusion in that region.  \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n9.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. Expanding financial services across the country, \nincluding regions with the highest levels of poverty, is critical to achieving the government\u2019s \nagenda of promoting inclusive growth. On 1 July 2015, the government launched the Philippines\u2019 \nfirst NSFI to coordinate broad-based initiatives for greater financial inclusion.16 The NSFI serves \nas a guide for stakeholders to systematically accelerate financial inclusion in the Philippines. The \nobjective of the NSFI is to achieve a regionally responsive, development-oriented, and inclusive \nfinancial system that provides for the evolving needs of a diverse Filipino public. The four key \nareas of the strategy are (i) policy and regulation, (ii) financial education and consumer protection, \n(iii) advocacy programs, and (iv) data and measurement. NSFI initiatives and areas of policy \nreform  cover  (i)  digital  finance,  (ii)  financial  literacy,  (iii)  credit  information  systems, \n(iv) development of a movable collateral registry, (v) diversification of financial products and \nservices, and (vi) strengthening of the capacity of financial service providers. The NSFI has been \nembraced by the PDP, 2017\u20132022, which calls for the development of inclusive business models \nand social enterprises to better engage MSMEs and to increase their access to finance. \n \n10.  Proposed policy reforms. The use of a programmatic approach with a policy-based loan \nand  technical  assistance  (TA)  provides  for  comprehensive  and  flexible  support  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program over the medium to long term. Subprogram 1, which is the first of \ntwo subprograms, contains 14 high-impact reforms, including seven policy triggers and seven \n                                                \n15  A microfinance bank is defined as either a rural or thrift bank with more than 50% of its portfolio in microfinance. \n    BSP. 2017.

Manila. \n \n ", "5 \npolicy milestones.17 All policy actions have been accomplished. The program will support the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts under the NSFI to increase financial inclusion by (i) strengthening the \ninstitutional and policy environment, (ii) improving the financial infrastructure, and (iii) increasing \nthe capacity and reach of service providers with a focus on nonbank financial institutions in rural \nareas. TA will  support policy reforms proposed under subprogram 2 and the medium-term results \nframework.18 The scope of the TA includes (i) development of a road map for agriculture finance, \n(ii)  development  of  diverse  microinsurance  products  and  services  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships, (iii) promotion of digital financial services, (iv) a strategic plan for financial literacy \ninitiatives, (v) strengthened capacity of financial service providers, and (vi) gender-responsive \nstrategies to support key policy reforms. Subprogram 2 may include a TA loan. A medium-term \ndirection and expected results policy framework covering 2016\u20132022 provides a structure for \ncontinued policy reforms and ongoing dialogue with government. \n \n11.  Institutional and policy environment for financial inclusion. This reform area reflects \nthe  implementation  of  institutional  measures  to  improve  access  to  finance  among  poorer \nhouseholds and MSMEs. Accomplishments under subprogram 1 included the government\u2019s \nsubmission of draft legislation to Congress for the development of a NIS with an identification \ncard,  and  a  commitment  of  $40  million  to  support  implementation  through  the  General \nAppropriations Act for 2018\u20132020. Over time, the NIS will increase the reach of the government\u2019s \nfinancial inclusion efforts and improve data availability, leading to increased financial inclusion, \nespecially among the poorest and most excluded segments of the population who are most likely \nto lack the identification needed to open a bank account or borrow from a financial institution. The \ngovernment also adopted complementary regulatory reforms to expand the availability of products \nand services. The Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) issued regulatory guidelines to support \nagricultural value chain finance and provided incentives to banks to offer agriculture finance \nproducts, including an increase of related single borrower limits. In addition, the government, \nthrough the Insurance Commission (IC), revised the regulatory framework to enable a broader \ndistribution of microinsurance to reach a wider range of clients. Specifically, the new regulations \nallow licensed microinsurance general agents, brokers, cooperative insurance societies, and \nmutual  benefit  associations  to  contract  services  of  microinsurance  providers,  drastically \nincreasing  the  potential  for  opening  new  accounts.  Finally,  Congress  passed  legislation \nestablishing an annual Economic and Financial Literacy Week to increase financial literacy across \nthe country. Under subprogram 2, the government will launch development of the NIS and will \nprovide a road map for the design and introduction of an identification card. The government will \ndevelop and implement a gender-sensitive agriculture finance road map and will roll out a new \nmicroinsurance scheme to increase coverage, especially for farmers. A financial education \nstocktaking assessment will support the development and of an enhanced financial learning \nprogram with tailored approaches for specific population segments, including women and youth. \n \n12.  Infrastructure for financial inclusion. This reform area reflects the government\u2019s efforts \nto  directly  increase  financial  inclusion  through  investment  in  support  systems  and  support \nnetworks. Accomplishments under subprogram 1 included the BSP\u2019s actions to upgrade the \nnational retail payment system to provide a more varied and a safer means of payment, especially \nfor lower-income customers. As part of the upgrade, the BSP established two clearing houses: \n(i) PESONet, which launched direct business-to-business and customer-to-business payments \nand  enabled  the  digitization  of  government-to-government  and  person-to-government \ntransactions;  and  (ii)  InstaPay,  which  makes  it  easier  and  less  costly  for  individuals  and \n                                                \n17 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement conditions, and policy milestones strengthen the program. \n18 ADB. 2016.

In  addition,  the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) integrated microfinance credit information into the \nnational credit information registry, which will expand access to credit for individuals and MSMEs. \nThe government also submitted legislation to Congress to provide an updated legal framework \nfor a national secured transaction registry, which will provide individuals and MSMEs with the \nability to pledge movable collateral, thereby increasing their access to credit and reducing its cost. \nThe government also completed an action plan to improve the existing credit guarantee schemes \nby consolidating and strengthening their management and governance. Under subprogram 2, the \nBSP will (i) continue enhancing the national retail payment system to support the expansion of \ndigital payments, (ii) issue additional financial technology licenses, and (iii) increase the ability of \nbanks to reach the underserved through agents and off-premise cash and deposit services. \nCoverage of the national credit information registry will continue to increase, and the Land \nRegistration Authority will establish a collateral registry. Finally, the government will launch its \nplan to improve existing credit guarantee schemes. \n \n13.  Capacity of financial service providers. This reform area reflects actions taken to \nimprove the capacity of MNGOs and to expand the reach of rural banks. Accomplishments under \nsubprogram 1 included the establishment of a Microfinance NGO Regulatory Council with the \nSEC as chair. The council subsequently adopted accreditation standards to strengthen the \nfinancial and social performance standards and governance practices of MNGOs. The program \nalso pilot-tested new technological innovations to improve the operational efficiency and outreach \nof rural banks. Finally, the government submitted legislation to Congress to establish a strong \nlegal and policy framework for the development of Islamic finance to expand access to financial \nservices in the ARMM in particular. Under subprogram 2, the council will accredit and monitor \nMNGOs and provide training programs to help build their capacity for compliance. Support for \ntechnical innovation will continue with the mainstreaming of cloud-based core banking solutions \nin the banking industry. The BSP will support passage of legislation, conduct gender-sensitive \nawareness-raising and capacity-building campaigns, and formulate regulations for issuance of \nsukuk (sharia-compliant bonds). \n \n \n ", "7 \n14.  ADB experience. A strong government commitment, complemented by ADB\u2019s support, \nhas created a vibrant microfinance industry and a conducive regulatory framework. The Rural \nMicroenterprise Finance Project laid the foundation for successful microfinance wholesale lending \noperations  and  contributed to the growth  of microfinance.19The  Microfinance  Development \nProgram  improved  the  microfinance  regulatory  environment,  strengthened  regulatory  and \noperational  capacity,  and  implemented  the  national  microfinance  literacy  program.20 These \nprograms were complemented by the Developing Financial Cooperatives Project, which improved \nthe regulatory environment for credit and savings cooperatives.21 The Developing Microinsurance \nProject helped the government set up a suitable regulatory environment and launch the National \nStrategy for Microinsurance in 2010.22 The Capacity Building for Microinsurance Project produced \nthe  regulatory  framework  necessary  to  support  the  development  of  microinsurance. 23 \nComplementing  this  support,  the  Encouraging  Investment  through  Capital  Market  Reforms \nProgram, approved by ADB in 2015, has supported reforms to deepen the capital market and \nexpand the institutional investor base to increase access to long-term finance, opening the door \nfor ADB\u2019s shift to expanding financial inclusion. 24 \n \n15.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s long engagement in the microfinance sector has informed the \nprogram design through four key lessons. First, increasing broad access to financial services \nrequires  a  comprehensive  strategy.  This  strategy  must  cover  the  institutional  and  policy \nenvironment, the types and accessibility of products and services offered, the infrastructure and \npayment system, and the capacity of financial service providers. Second, there should be strong \ngovernment ownership of the reforms and widespread political will to implement them. This is \nespecially important considering that certain barriers to financial inclusion (through initiatives such \nas an NIS, credit and collateral registries, and Islamic financial services) have not been addressed \nthrough earlier reforms because of the concerns of various stakeholders. Third, pilot projects \ntesting new strategies through a regulatory \u201csandbox\u201d approach (i.e., a test-and-learn approach) \nrepresent  an  important  part  of  policy  development  and  help  build  stakeholder  support  for \ninstitutional reforms.25 Fourth, building capacity should include close ADB involvement with \ngovernment and national and local government ownership of interventions. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. The program design \nbenefited from the explicit commitment of the government through the NSFI. The program also \nincorporates knowledge gained from sustained ADB policy dialogue with key stakeholders as well \nas previous and ongoing TA implementation. Most recently, ADB has worked closely with the \nBSP to identify priority areas of reform and has helped identify ways to strengthen agriculture \nfinance, improve coordination of financial literacy, and explore innovation in the banking sector. \n                                                \n19 ADB. 1996.

ADB has also worked closely with the SEC to \ndevelop financial, social, and governance standards for MNGOs and an accreditation framework \nto professionalize and scale their operations. ADB is also supporting the development of a \nregulatory framework for Islamic finance.28 \n \n17.  Development partner coordination. Since 2000, ADB has worked closely with the \ngovernment and other development partners to support the government\u2019s goal of increasing \nfinancial inclusion in the Philippines. Since 2015, the NSFI steering committee, chaired by the \nBSP, has coordinated development partner support. Key development agencies actively involved \nin supporting financial inclusion include Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). ADB and \nAFD are working closely to align technical assistance to support implementation of the Inclusive \nFinance Development Program. In addition, the AFD is exploring the possibility to provide parallel \ncollaborative  cofinancing  for  subprogram  2.  Other  development  partners  include  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit, the \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Labor Organization, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, the United States Agency for International Development, and the \nWorld Bank. Within this framework, ADB and the World Bank are closely collaborating to support \nimplementation of the NSFI, including an expansion of agriculture finance and insurance. ADB \nhas worked closely with Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit to develop a \nstrong regulatory framework and financial literacy for microinsurance. The IFC has worked with \nthe Credit Information Corporation to establish a credit information system and has supported the \ndevelopment of an updated regulatory framework for secured transactions, including an online \ncollateral registry. ADB and the IFC are collaborating on ways to raise awareness of the credit \nand collateral registries. The United States Agency for International Development has long \nsupported innovation in the rural banking sector and the promotion of electronic money. Recent \ndiscussions with ADB have focused on coordinated support for Islamic finance in Mindanao.  \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n18.  Economic impact of the program. The program impact assessment estimates the \npotential net present value of benefits (benefits minus costs) of the program to range from $1.5 \nto $4.6 billion. Benefits arise primarily out of reforms which will increase the number of account \nholders and the average savings of the new account holders, which together boost GDP. The \npresent value of the costs arise primarily from the adoption of a national identification system. In \naddition to the economic growth, the reforms supported by the program yield other economic \nbenefits such as a reduction in poverty and increased participation in the formal economy.29 \n \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2017.

The government has requested a single tranche loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1, with an indicative $300 million for subprogram 2. \nSubprogram 2 may include a $10 million TA loan to help further develop financial inclusion. The \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a 3-year grace period, annuity method with 30% discount, \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. The average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity \npremium payable to ADB.30 The loan size is based on the Philippines\u2019 financing needs, the \ndevelopment impact of the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the \nreforms. In 2018, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $17.4 billion, \none fifth of which will be from foreign borrowing. The foreign borrowing will comprise government \nbonds estimated at $1.0 billion and official development assistance estimated at $2.5 billion. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the executing agency with the BSP, Bureau of \nTreasury, Department of Justice, IC, Philippine Statistics Authority, and SEC as implementing \nagencies. A steering committee chaired by the DOF, with the implementing agencies as members, \nwill  oversee  implementation  of  the  program.  The  implementation  periods  are \nMarch 2016\u2014April 2018 for subprogram 1 and May 2018\u2013May 2020 for subprogram 2. The \n \nproceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n21.  Safeguards.  Subprogram  1  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n22.  Poverty  and  social.  The  direct  beneficiaries  of  the  program  include  the  central \ngovernment, private stakeholders such as rural banks, financial technology companies, MSMEs, \nindustry  associations,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  indirect  beneficiaries  of  the \nprogram  include  investors,  enterprises,  entrepreneurs,  farmers,  workers,  consumers,  and \nvulnerable households. Entrepreneurs, farmers, workers, and poor households will benefit from \na broader range of financial products and services, better access to services by gaining financial \nliteracy, and stronger protection frameworks that boost resilience to shocks. Subprogram 1 is \ncategorized as some gender elements, with key gender actions including collection of credit \ninformation disaggregated by sex and promotion of gender diversity on MNGO boards. The \nprogram is expected to generate benefits for women and increase their access to financial \nservices through the development of an NIS (considering that women are less likely than men to \nhave identification documents required to open a bank account) and efforts to strengthen MNGOs, \nwhich predominantly serve women. A gender gap assessment will be conducted through TA to \nstrengthen  the  gender  focus  of  subprogram  2  for  categorization  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. \n \n23.  Governance.  The  latest  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment \nconfirmed that three of seven core areas (transparency, policy-based budgeting, asset\u2013liability \n                                                \n30 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n ", "10 \nmanagement) have improved and are now considered strong. Areas of weakness identified in the \nassessment\u2014budget credibility, predictability and control in budget execution, and external \nscrutiny and audit\u2014are being actively addressed by government. The proposed Public Financial \nAccountability Act will help to enforce accountability in the public financial management system \nand  increase  budget  transparency  and  participation.  The  government  is  implementing  a \ncomprehensive results-based anticorruption plan to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman and \nthe justice subsector, which have achieved positive results. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n24.  Risks and mitigating measures. The program has two substantial risks. Public financial \nmanagement is assessed as a substantial risk because of a dispersion of responsibilities among \noversight agencies, weak budget execution, and a lack of transparency. These weaknesses are \nbeing mitigated by government by improvements in transparency, policy-based budgeting, and \naccounting and record keeping. The government has also strengthened the budget review \nprocess,  reduced  the  number  and  size  of  special  purpose  funds,  and  institutionalized \ntransparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. A second substantial risk, corruption, \nis  being  mitigated  through  the  Philippines\u2019  Cabinet  Cluster  on  Good  Governance  and \nAnti-Corruption, which has implemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action \nplan. 31 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n25.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n26.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loan would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the programmatic approach for the Inclusive Finance Development Program; and \n(ii)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of the \nInclusive Finance Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nin regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n27 August 2018 \n                                                \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nResilient and inclusive finance sector achieved (Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By 2022:    Macroeconomic \nFinancial inclusion  a.
