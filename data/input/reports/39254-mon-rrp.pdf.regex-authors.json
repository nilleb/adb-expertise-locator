The Project will support the \nGovernment  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  primary  and \nsecondary education with a view to shifting to a 12-year education \nsystem.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improving  education \nplanning, management, and budgeting; (ii) strengthening pre-service \nteacher training (PSTT); (iii) enhancing the quality, affordability, and \nlevels  of  provision  of  textbooks  and  other  teaching  and  learning \nmaterials, including enhanced innovation in the use of information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) in the classroom; and (iv) providing \nbetter learning conditions by upgrading the physical infrastructure of \nteacher training institutes (TTIs). \n \n   \nRationale  Progress has been made in the education sector over the past decade, \npartly  as  a  result  of  effective  working  relationships  between  the \nGovernment and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the other key \ndevelopment partners. However, support is still needed to reform and \ntransform the education system and to upgrade essential services and \nfacilities. ADB has supported the Government to move from an 11-year \nto a 12-year education system, which will align Mongolia\u2019s education \nsystem with international standards. Successful implementation of this \npolicy will require a comprehensive reform of the PSTT, reducing the \ncost and improving the provision of textbooks, streamlining education \nfinance, budgeting and planning, introducing innovative approaches to \neducation by enhancing the use of ICT for education, and improving \nTTI facilities in support of comprehensive reforms in PSTT. The Project \nwill support the Government to implement this policy effectively and \nefficiently and to ensure it is sustainable. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be improved quality, access, efficiency, \nand effectiveness of the 12-year education system. The outcome of the \nProject will be an effective 12-year education system. \n   \n ", "ii   \nProject Investment Plan  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $10,830,000,  of  which \n$10,000,000  will  be  financed  from  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \ngrant funds and $830,000 will be financed by the Government in the \nform of taxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  10.00    92.34 \nGovernment of Mongolia   0.83    7.66 \n        10.83       100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nGrant Amount   ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund \nresources to finance 92.34% of the total project cost. \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  Until 31 March 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the state secretary of \nArrangements  MECS, will include senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and MECS, \nand project aimag representatives will provide overall guidance. The \nPSC  will  provide  strategic  guidance,  monitor  implementation,  and \nensure funding agency coordination. The PSC will meet quarterly and \nwill be responsible for approving the annual project budget and activity \nplan and for reviewing and advising on implementation progress. The \nProject will be implemented through the current project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  established  under  the  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram, Second Education Development Project, and Third Education \nDevelopment Project, staffed by a project manager and five additional \nstaff, who will be responsible for the overall implementation of activities. \nThe PIU will report to the project director and provide quarterly result-\nbased progress reports to the PSC, MECS management, and ADB.  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance \nwith its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement  of  civil  works  will  be  carried  out  through  national \ncompetitive  bidding.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be  performed \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  and  national  competitive \nbidding satisfactory to ADB, and shopping. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 18 person-months of international consulting services and 150 \nperson-months of national consulting services will be contracted under \nthe grant funds. The international and national consultants will have \nexpertise  in  (i)  education  finance,  management,  and  planning; \n(ii) textbook provision systems, cost reduction strategies, and textbook \n ", "  iii\n \n \n  publishing  skills;  (iii)  development  and  implementation  of  national \nstrategies  for  ICT  in  education,  the  use  of  ICT  as  a  learning  and \nteaching tool, and local language educational software development; \n(iv) all aspects of PSTT; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. Consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Students  enrolled  in  primary  and  secondary  schools  will  be  direct \nBeneficiaries  beneficiaries of the modernization of the education system. Nationwide, \nabout 540,000 students and their parents will gain from the improved \naffordability, cost, and durability of textbooks and learning materials. \nAbout  110,000  students  from  poor  families  will  benefit  from  better \ntargeting of free textbook provision under the Project. About 10,000 \nstudent teachers and 1,200 teacher educators throughout the country \nwill benefit from improvements to PSTT in five TTIs and from upgraded \nteaching and learning facilities. Graduates of these TTIs entering the \nteaching labor force will be able to improve education quality and to \nclose  the  urban\u2013rural  gap  in  education  achievement.  Students  and \ncommunities in rural areas will benefit from ICT centers of excellence. \nOther  specific  project  benefits  will  include:  increased  planning  and \nmanagement capacity of MECS and local education staff, leading to an \nimproved  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp);  and  better  planning  and \nimplementation of ICT investments. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Successful implementation of the Project rests on the assumption that \nthe Government will (i) maintain a high level of budget allocation for the \neducation  sector;  (ii)  be  committed  to  improving  funding  agency \ncoordination  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the \ndelivery of education services; (iii) maintain its commitment to carry out \neducation reforms, including national curriculum reform; (iv) provide an \nadequate  budget  to  provide  PSTT;  and  (v)  reform  the  textbook \nprovision  system.  To  achieve  its  impact,  the  Project  assumes  that \nfurther  steady  economic  growth  in  Mongolia  will  create  new  job \nopportunities for graduates. The managerial and technical capacity of \nMECS  is  limited  in  some  areas  and  this  might  affect  the  smooth \nimplementation of the extension of the school system to a 12-year \nsystem and the introduction of the new textbook provision and reforms \nin  PSTT.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  training  and  capacity \nbuilding under the Project. A high turnover of officials and senior staff in \nkey agencies, resulting in slow progress or resistance to reforms, is \nalso a risk. That risk will be mitigated through assurances confirming \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to education reforms and by adopting a \nstakeholder  participatory  approach,  and  building  core  technical  and \nmanagement  capacity  in  MECS  through  the  Project  and  the  ADB-\nfunded SWAp technical assistance. \n \n ", "96o  00'E 111 o 00'E\nMONGOLIA\nEDUCATION SECTOR REFORM PROJECT\nR  U  S  S  I  A  N        F  E  D  E  R  A  T  I  O  N\nHanh\n50 o 00'N 50 o 00'N\nUlaanbayshint Ulaangom Hatgal\nUVS Altanbulag\nHOVSGOL\nDayaTnsengel Tsagaannuur Naranbulag Tes Tsagaan-Uul Moron BULGANSuhbaatar SELENGE Ereentsav\nBAYAN- Olgiy Olgiy Selenge Darhan\nOLGIY Tudevtey Hutag-Ondor Erdenet DARHAN-UUL Bayan-Uul\nDORNOD Havirga\nHovd ZAVHAN Bulgan ORHONSumber\nARHANGAY ULAANBAATAR HENTIY Choybalsan\nManhan Uliastay Tsahir BattsHeisnhgiegl Ondor ULAANBAABTAagRanuur Batnorov\nDariv Lun Nalayh\nHOVD Tayshir Tsetserleg ZuuTnOmVod Maanit Ondorhaan Monhhaan Matad Tamsagbulag\nYarantay Harhorin GOVISUMBER\nUyench Altay Bayanhongor Choyr Baruun-Urt\nTogrog Buutsagaan Arvayheer Erdenetsagaan\nBichigt\nMandalgovi\nNariynteel SUHBAATAR\nGOVI-ALTAY\nOVORHANGAY\nDUNDGOVI Saynshand\nBurgastay BAYANHONGOR\nTsogt-Ovoo DORNOGOVI\nZamyn-Uud\nDalanzadgad\n42 o 00'N OMNOGOVI Bayan-Ovoo 42 o 00'N\nNational Capital\nGashuun Suhayt\nProvincial Capital\nCity/Town\nN\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC Main Road\nOF  CHINA  Provincial Road\nRailway\n0 50 100150200250\nRiver\nKilometers Provincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n8\n-3\n1\n8\n6 E 96o  00'E 111 o 00'E\nG", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \nMongolia for the Education Sector Reform Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  The Government of Mongolia considers improving the quality of the education system, \nenhancing access to basic education, and improving higher education to be key instruments to \nreduce poverty, accelerate economic growth, and reduce disparities in the development process, \nparticularly between rural and urban areas. In accordance with the Government\u2019s development \nstrategy, the Project is included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2008\u20132010.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  In 1990, immediately before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Mongolia had a high gross \nenrollment ratio and adult literacy rate. Cessation of Soviet financial and technical support had a \ndramatic impact on educational provision, quality, and standards and by 1995 the gross enrollment \nratio had fallen to 81%. Since this low point, Mongolia has made notable progress toward re-\ndeveloping its education sector. In 2006, the gross enrollment rate had recovered to 95% for \nprimary and secondary education, and the adult literacy rate had been maintained at 97%. Annual \npublic expenditure on education is high (about 7% of gross domestic product) in comparison with \nthat of many neighboring countries.  \n \n4.  The  ongoing  partnership  between  the  Government  and  ADB  and  other  major  funding \nagencies (notably the Embassy of Japan in the education sector) has been a major factor in the \nspeed of the education sector\u2019s recovery. ADB assistance for the education sector began with the \nEducation Sector Development Program (ESDP), which was approved in 1996. ESDP succeeded \nin implementing measures to rationalize the education system, improve cost recovery, support \nprivatization  and  private  sector  provision,  strengthen  management  capabilities,  and  upgrade \neducation content. It contributed significantly to increasing enrollment rates from 81% in 1996 to \n91% in 2002, to decreasing dropout rates from 3.5% to 2.3% over the same period, and to \nimproving the effectiveness of the system and the quality of education services. A post-project \nperformance evaluation in April 2007 rated the program \u201chighly successful\u201d. Under the Second \nEducation  Development  Project  (SEDP)  and  Third  Education  Development  Project  (TEDP), \napproved in 2002 and 2006 respectively, key initiatives supported by ADB have included in-service \nteacher training, development of curriculum and state education standards, enhancing education \nmanagement  and  planning,  and  rehabilitation  of  schools  and  learning  spaces.  ADB\u2019s  recent \ncountry assistance program evaluation report for Mongolia2 rated assistance to education as the \nbest  performing  part  of  ADB\u2019s  portfolio.  The  proposed  Project  and  the  ongoing  TEDP  are \ncomplementary: (i) TEDP supports the development of curriculum and education standards and \nthe proposed Project will support development and provision of textbooks that incorporate the new \ncurriculum; (ii) TEDP supports the national accreditation of teacher training institutes (TTIs) and the \nproposed Project will enhance overall quality of pre-service teacher training (PSTT); and (iii) TEDP \nsupports  in-service  teacher  training  centers  (focusing  on  moving  from  lecturing  to  interactive \nlearning, using computer-based problem solving techniques) and the proposed Project supports \nthe use of information and communication technology (ICT) for education and the establishment of \nICT centers of excellence (focusing on training and strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate \nICT as a teaching and learning tool). \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Although  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  expanding  access  to  education  and \nimplementing reforms that strengthen the sector, further focused support is needed in some key \nareas to improve and sustain education quality. Despite achievements in Mongolia\u2019s education \nsector, a significant proportion of children in rural areas still do not attend primary or secondary \nschool.3 In the countryside, 8% of all children aged 7 to 15 have never enrolled in school, 19% drop \nout before completing grade 8, and only 55% of students (45% in rural areas) complete upper \nsecondary education.  Improving net enrollment rates in rural areas remains a challenge, and there \nare significant gaps in performance on student achievement tests and progression rates in school \nfor students from rural areas.4 Rural\u2013urban migration has brought new challenges in the education \nsector, as schools in urban centers have seen demand for services increase substantially, while \nsome rural schools are now operating below capacity as a result of outflows from their catchment \nareas. \n \n6.  The Mongolian education system is currently undergoing a major change to align it with \ninternational standards. According to Clause 7.2 of the Law on Education, with effect from school \nyear (SY) 2008\u20132009, the school system will move from an 11-year to a 12-year system, and the \nschool entry age will be lowered from 7 to 6 years. Approximately 43,000 6-year-olds are expected \nto join the formal education system in 2008. The change will increase total enrollments by about \n9%  and  place  greater  demands  on  school  and  classroom  capacity,  teaching  skills,  and  the \nprovision of a range of teaching and learning materials. In addition, this transition will require \nadjustments  to  the  curriculum,  PSTT  programs,  teaching  and  learning  materials,  and  age-\nappropriate school facilities for 6-year-old pupils. The Government has a plan in its budgetary \nframework to finance school facilities for 6-year-old pupils in primary schools, and has allocated \nfunds in the 2009 budget for school facilities for this age group. The Government\u2019s commitment is \nreflected in the Letter of Assurance in Supplementary Appendix F. There will also be an impact on \nrelated recurrent costs, budgeting, and management requirements. An overview of the Mongolian \neducation sector and its performance is in Appendix 2. The planned transition to a 12-year school \nsystem has brought a new range of concerns about access and quality of education in Mongolia \nand the key constraints noted above, which are critical to efforts to improve the access and quality \nof education services, need to be addressed. A timely opportunity now exists for the Education \nSector Reform Project to support the Government to move to a 12-year education system in 2008 \nand to help project beneficiaries (educators, pupils, and parents) to meet the new challenges under \nthe new system. \n \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  The  Mongolian  education  system  still  faces  rural\u2013urban  disparities  in  educational \nachievement; low quality of PSTT; inefficiencies in educational planning and management; and \nchallenges  in  the  provision  of  low-cost,  high-quality  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials, \nincluding the introduction and effective use of ICT in primary and secondary education across the \ncurriculum. The physical infrastructure of TTIs is in urgent need of repair, which reflects shortages \nin government financing of higher education institutions.  \n                     \n8.  Poverty and Education Costs to Parents. Poverty continues to be a major national \nproblem, with 32.2% of the population officially categorized as below the poverty threshold.5 The \npoverty levels are much higher in rural than in urban areas, although inward migration to urban \nareas has created growing pockets of poverty in ger settlements. While the percentage of the \npopulation below the poverty threshold is decreasing in urban areas, the gap between urban and \nrural poverty is widening and in the Western Region, 51% of the population is below the poverty \n                                                 \n3  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2007.

Washington, DC.  \n5  Established at $2.00 per day, and based on the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Surveys (1998\u20132002 and \n2006). \n ", "  3\nthreshold. Poverty has a significant impact on school attendance and on school quality. Focus \ngroup  discussions  conducted  in  seven  aimags  with  parents,  teachers,  and  aimag  education \nofficials revealed that in every aimag the costs of education to parents, including the costs of \ntextbooks, stationery, school uniforms, and travel to school are major concerns. The World Bank\u2019s \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey (2002/2003) indicates that textbooks are the highest \nexpenditure item in household spending on education, accounting for 46% of educational spending \nat the primary level and 43% at secondary level. For the poorest segment of the population, \ntextbook costs account for 59% of educational expenditures for primary education and 58% for \nsecondary education. The Government\u2019s policy of free textbook allocations to 20% of the students \nis insufficient given the national poverty level of 32%. It is also not well targeted, and is reported to \nbe administered inefficiently. For families with more than one child of school age to educate, \nmigrants to Ulaanbaatar, and families in rural areas education may be unaffordable, resulting in \nlower participation in education and higher dropout rates.  \n \n9.  Government Financing of Education. School surveys and focus groups revealed that \nteachers and school principals are concerned about inadequate capital investment and operational \nbudgets. Funding for maintaining fixed assets is inadequate, leading to shorter asset life cycles \nand the poor condition and degradation of school buildings and other infrastructure. The guidelines \non  fixed  costs  need  to  be  revised  to  ensure  that  the  ceilings  sufficiently  cover  all  relevant \nexpenditure items to minimize cost underruns experienced by most schools. The Government \nrecentralized  education  financing  in  2002,  but  inconsistencies  in  budget  approval  and \ndisbursement remain, as recentralization has not occurred in one-third of schools (those located in \nUlaanbaatar). The shift to the 12-year education structure has far-reaching implications for the \nGovernment's recurrent costs, budgeting, and management requirements. Increased education \nenrollments by over 40,000 (9%) per year will also require investments in additional facilities for \nvery young children. An overview of financing in education is in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  Rural\u2013Urban Discrepancies in Education Quality. A significant proportion of the children \nin rural areas still do not attend primary or secondary school.6 Despite improvements in school \nattendance over the past 5 years, rural students are still at a disadvantage. In particular, many \nrural  schools  closed  their  upper  secondary  classes  during  the  school  reorganization  and \nrationalization reform in 1997, while provincial center complex schools have only limited numbers \nof upper secondary spaces. There is a widespread public perception that the quality of education in \nrural areas is inferior to that in urban areas, which is confirmed by significant gaps in performance. \nThe prospect of moving nearer to better education facilities and opportunities in urban areas is \nreported to be a major cause of migration to urban areas, especially for women.7  \n \n11.  Curriculum Reform and the Provision of Teaching and Learning Materials. The 11-\nyear education system launched in 2005 was accompanied by the development of new state \neducation standards. However, these standards need to be simplified as teachers and teacher \neducators find them difficult to translate into clear student competencies. The curriculum remains \noverloaded  with  content  and  the  assessment  system  does  not  test  the  new  skills  and \ncompetencies that have been added to the existing content requirements. The shift to the 12-year \nstructure will require further reform of the curriculum and a new set of state education standards. A \nnew curriculum is being developed under the ADB-funded TEDP and it will be completed during \nSY2008\u20132009 and piloted during the following year. The state education standards date from 2004 \nand will be revised in 2009. This will require the revision and/or re-publication of all textbooks and \nteachers\u2019 guides from 2010. The development of textbooks and teachers\u2019 guides was liberalized \nand  privatized  from  2005  and  currently  private  publishers  compete  in  the  supply  of  course \nmaterials, which are selected by individual schools. However, the new system is not working \n                                                 \n6  UNDP. 2007. MDG Implementation. Second National Report.

Full ownership of a complete set of textbooks is achieved \nby only 37% of students.8 Teachers have to purchase their own copies of students\u2019 textbooks and \nthe associated teachers\u2019 guides. Many cannot afford to do this, which has implications for the \nquality of the education offered. There also are reported problems with textbook content and with \nthe textbook submission, evaluation, and approval systems. Corruption is reported to be prevalent \nin  the  selection  and  procurement  of  textbooks,  uniforms,  and  school  lunches,  and  textbook \nprocurement is not covered by the Public Procurement Law.9 The current curriculum and the \nassociated textbook problems must be resolved if access to good textbooks is to improve. \n \n12.  Pre-Service Teacher Training. One of the main constraints on improving educational \nquality is the inadequacy of the PSTT system. The teaching profession has suffered a demotion of \nstatus, resulting in a shortage of qualified teachers, especially in rural areas. The distribution of \nteachers is unequal among regions, with disadvantaged areas typically receiving less well-trained \nteachers. Overall, only 40% of the graduates from TTIs go to work in schools, and fewer still go to \nwork  in  rural  schools, although  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science  (MECS)  has \nintroduced financial incentives for teachers in rural areas. University admission requirements for \nteachers are much lower than for other professions, and are particularly lower for teacher training \ncolleges in provincial cities, compared to TTIs in Ulaanbaatar, as demand for teacher training \ncourses has declined in the provinces.10 Low entry standards have lowered the standard of teacher \ngraduates. The financing system for higher education, in which all revenues come from tuition fees, \nmeans TTIs lack incentives to offer teacher training programs and some have opted to offer other \nprograms that generate more revenues. The adoption of a new student-centered curriculum puts a \nhigh premium on effective teacher training and requires pre-service training institutions to provide a \nrange of professional skills required by schools to launch an effective student-centered curriculum. \nAn overview of TTIs is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n13.  Poor  Maintenance  of  Teacher  Training  Institutes.  Higher  education  has  undergone \nprofound changes since Mongolia\u2019s independence, including deregulation and a rapid increase in \nprivate higher education institutions, a considerable increase in student enrollments over the last \n15 years, and significant changes in government funding of higher education. Faced with priorities \nfor  funding  primary  and  secondary  education,  the  Government  has  cut  spending  on  higher \neducation and introduced fees, which institutions used to offset the loss of direct state funding. \nFrom 1997, only heat, water, and electricity costs have been covered by the Government but from \n2001 to 2007 even this funding has been limited, despite the 1998 education law, which made \nspecific provision for it. The impact of current funding policies on the quality of provision of PSTT \nhas been significant. Mongolia\u2019s TTIs have received very little maintenance and repair for over a \ndecade. Many provide substandard learning environments and spaces. They are in urgent need of \ninvestment in laboratories, libraries, ICT, and refurbishment, and such investments are needed to \nsupport the proposed reforms in PSTT under the Project. Very little funding is allocated to teaching \nand learning facilities (for example, to books and journals in the library or to the Internet and e-\nlearning facilities). A generally perceived view is that the physical working environment is not \u201cfit for \npurpose\u201d, with outdated facilities and equipment being the major concern.  \n \n14.  ICT in Education Policies and Strategies. The Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP) \n2006\u20132015 confirmed that MECS intends to develop ICT capacity and usage across the curriculum \n                                                 \n8  UNICEF Learning Achievement Study (2008) and project preparatory TA School Survey (2008). \n9  ADB. 2008. Risk Assessments and Risk Management Plans for National Systems and the Education and Urban \nInfrastructure Sectors in Mongolia. Manila. \n10 At the Mongolian State University of Education (MSUE), the admission requirement for teachers is 350\u2013450 points out \nof a maximum of 800 in the general education state examinations. The entry level can be as low as 200\u2013250 points in \nTTIs outside Ulaanbaatar. In contrast, journalism and economics and statistics programs offered at MSUE require a \nminimum score of 600 points. \n ", "  5\n(i.e., in all subjects and at all grade levels). ESMP sets targets for levels of computer provision at \nprimary schools (1 computer per 250 students), secondary schools (1 computer per 50 students), \nand high schools (1 computer per 5 students). In addition, the Government is experimenting in a \nnumber of pilot schools with the use of the XO low-cost laptop for all pupils in grades 2\u20135 as part of \nthe one-laptop-per-child scheme. However, at present there is no clearly defined national ICT \nstrategy and no forward projections or calculations have been undertaken to estimate the total cost \nimplications (total cost of ownership) of any of these targets, nor is there a strategy for the use of \ncomputers across the curriculum. Schools complain that their operational budgets are insufficient \nto  pay  for  recurrent  ICT  costs  (power,  telecommunications,  maintenance  and  servicing,  and \nconsumables) and there is inadequate investment in teacher training in the effective use of ICT as \na teaching and learning tool and in the development of appropriate software in the Mongolian \nlanguage. Research studies by ADB indicate the potential high cost and low effectiveness of \nunplanned approaches to ICT provision, the importance of a comprehensive national strategy for \nICT in education, and a clear understanding of the downstream cost implications.11 \n  \n15.  Gender Imbalances in Education. Girls outnumber boys in school in every aimag and in \nUlaanbaatar. Eighty percent12 of students completing secondary education are female, as are 63% \nof tertiary undergraduates. Girls outnumber boys in every higher education discipline except for art, \narchitecture, and engineering. The disparity between boys and girls is highest in rural areas where \ndropout rates for boys are much higher than for girls. Boys are expected to undertake herder roles \nwhile  families  encourage  and  support  girls  to  enter  education  as  a  means  of  providing  for \nthemselves. The sharp increase in the direct costs of education has increased these gender \ndisparities, since the cost of boys\u2019 education is now a direct charge on families rather than a \ncharge on the state as it was during the central planning period.13 \n \n16.  Project Rationale. Despite progress in the education sector over the past decade, in part \nbecause  of  the  effective  working  relationship  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  continuing \nsupport for reform, transformation of the education system, and upgrading of essential services \nand facilities are needed. The demands of transition and the loss of Soviet financial support have \ncreated  budget  problems  in  educational  financing,  which  in  turn  have  been  exacerbated  by \nsubstandard financial planning and management systems. Schools and higher education suffer \nfrom a lack of both capital investment and recurrent budget allocations from the Government and \nthere has been a sharp increase in the direct and the indirect costs of education for parents. These \nhave  reduced  participation  rates,  particularly  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  for  boys.  The \ndeterioration  in  educational  provision  in  rural  areas  is  one  of  the  major  reported  causes  of \nmigration to the cities, which in turn brings pressure to bear on urban educational institutions.  \n \n17.  In this context, the key issues in the current Mongolian education system are the need for \n(i) reform in education finance, planning, budgeting, and management; (ii) strengthening teaching \nqualifications  and  skills  through  PSTT;  (iii)  improving  quality,  relevance,  affordability,  and \nsustainability in the provision of textbooks and other learning materials, including the effective and \ninnovative use of ICT for education, and in view of the introduction of student-centered learning; \nand (iv) improving the education infrastructure, particularly facilities, in TTIs. The Project will build \non the policy platform established by previous projects and continue the reform agenda in tandem \nwith the government\u2019s ESMP and National Development Strategy.  \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008.

The development of a sector-wide approach (SWAp) is a key \nplatform of the ESMP 2006\u20132015, which was prepared with the assistance of ADB in 2005. An \neducation donors\u2019 consultative mechanism (EDCM), co-chaired by MECS, ADB, and the Embassy \nof Japan, was established in 2005 and it guides collaboration between the Government and its \ndevelopment partners. In 2007, ADB supported a TA project for the Development of a SWAp in \nEducation.14  Under  this  TA,  the  Government  has  made  progress  in  developing  an  effective \napproach to sector-wide planning. The EDCM prepares and monitors annual implementation plans \nto track the significant progress being made in integrating the SWAp into the Government\u2019s internal \nplanning process and the fiscal cycle. The key projects in the education sector in Mongolia are \nbeing  implemented  by  one  project  implementation  unit  (PIU),  an  important  step  toward \nharmonization. For example, the ADB PIU for the TEDP is also in charge of the Education for All-\nFast  Track  Initiative15  (EFA-FTI)  implementation.  ADB  TA  support  for  the  SWAp  has  been \nextended to 2008\u20132009 and aims to strengthen MECS\u2019s core technical and management capacity \nto take a phased approach to establishing a SWAp in education. The Project complements other \nfunding agencies\u2019 efforts by supporting areas they are not addressing, e.g., provision of cheaper \ntextbooks  and  comprehensive  reforms  in  PSTT.  The  development  of  a  national  ICT  strategy \ncomplements other funding agencies\u2019 investments in computer hardware, including the one-laptop-\nper-child initiative, funded by several funding agencies. The project concept was presented at the \ngeneral EDCM meeting. Appendix 3 summarizes external assistance to the Mongolian education \nsector. \n \n19.  Lessons  Learned.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  ADB-funded  education  projects16 \ninclude the need for (i) close funding agency coordination, particularly in areas where there may be \noverlapping inputs (e.g., school buildings), and a comprehensive working partnership between \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  Government;  (ii)  adequate  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nbudgets to support investments in equipment and facilities and to ensure effective usage (this is a \nmajor issue, for example, in the development of a national ICT strategy); and (iii) an approach that \nbuilds on experience gained in past projects rather than shifting focus to new areas of activity. \nThus, the grant assistance for ICT for Innovating Rural Education in Mongolia (IIREM) provides a \nmodel for using ICT to develop content, new teaching approaches, and access to information for \npoor  rural  schools.  It  will  serve  as  the  starting  point  for  sustainable  and  cost-effective  ICT \ndevelopments under this Project. Similarly, the expense of learning and teaching materials will \nhave an adverse impact on the curriculum reform currently being undertaken by the ADB-funded \nTEDP, unless this issue is addressed by the Project. Detailed lessons learned are in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Education Sector Reform.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The impact of the Project will be improved quality, access, efficiency, and effectiveness of \nthe 12-year education system. The outcome of the Project will be an effective 12-year education \nsystem. \n \nB.   Outputs \n \n21.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  improved  education  planning, management,  and \nbudgeting; (ii) strengthened PSTT; (iii) improved quality, affordability, and levels of provision of \ntextbooks and other teaching and learning materials, including enhanced innovation in the use of \nICT  in  the  classroom;  and  (iv)  improved  learning  conditions  in  TTIs  through  support  for  the \nupgrading of the physical infrastructure. The outputs were derived through extensive consultation \nwith stakeholders from public, private, and nongovernmental sectors at central and local levels, \nincluding in remote locations, school visits, school surveys, and focus groups.  \n \n  1.  Component  1:  Improved  Educational  Planning,  Management,  and \n  Budgeting \n \n22.  This component will (i) strengthen the institutional capacity of MECS to enable it to carry out \nmore efficient planning, management, and delivery of education services; and (ii) improve existing \neducation finance policies to promote autonomy, transparency, and accountability at all levels.  \n \n23.  Strengthening Information Systems. Under the SEDP, ADB funding was allocated to \nfinance the procurement of hardware and software for the education management information \nsystem (EMIS). Project preparatory TA assessments indicate that continued TA is needed to \nimprove both the technical and operational aspects of the existing system. Currently, there are a \nnumber of management information systems within MECS, including the EMIS in the Department \nof Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation; the human resource MIS in the Department of Public \nAdministration;  and  the  financial  MIS  in  the  Department  of  Economics  and  Finance.  Various \ndepartments maintain subsets of the MIS for their own operational and professional disciplines. A \nschool infrastructure MIS subset and better integration of the various systems are urgently needed. \nThe Project will support MECS to: (i) assess the current education planning and management \nsystem; (ii) establish guidelines for the use of information for education planning and developing \nannual implementation plans; (iii) design an MIS system that fully integrates all data sources, \nincluding those that may be developed in future; (iv) provide the software and hardware required to \ncarry out data collection and analysis at aimag, bagh, and soum levels; (v) strengthen the capacity \nof staff in gathering and analyzing statistics, performance and quality indicators, reporting, and \nforecasting; and (vi) ensure the use of gender-disaggregated data and the inclusion of means to \naddress gender issues in primary and secondary education through a synchronized EMIS. The \nProject will also help to ensure that the financial MIS subset is compatible with the existing system \nat the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n24.  Improving  School-Based  Financial  Policies.  The  Government\u2019s  recentralization  of \neducation financing in 2002 has not achieved its objective of simplifying processes and increasing \ntransparency  in  school  accounting.  The  process  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  not  uniform \nthroughout the country despite the fact that the Public Sector Management and Finance Law has \nclear provisions on transparency, accountability, and control. The Project will support school-based \nfinancial  reforms  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  conducting  assessments  of  education  finance \nrecentralization and reinforcing compliance in all schools throughout the country, including those in \nUlaanbaatar; (ii) reforming the public investment system so that fixed asset investments and O&M \n ", "8   \nbudgets are closely linked; (iii) adjusting school budgeting systems to enable them to allocate \nappropriate amounts for operational expenses (a block grant system based on a funding formula is \nstrongly recommended); (iv) conducting a study on reforming the school teacher salary system and \nappointment  of  school  and  preschool  principals  in  order  to  enhance  responsibility  and \naccountability in schools; (v) preparing a school management handbook and ICT support systems \nfor school management; and (vi) strengthening the capacity of MECS staff, aimag finance officers, \nschool administrators, and accountants in budgeting and financial management. With regard to the \npublic investment system, the Project will support the Government by (i) building capacity to \nassess  and  monitor  investments  in  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  educational  institutions;  \n(ii) developing appropriate and practical criteria for the allocation of annual O&M funding; and  \n(iii) setting up a functional MIS to enable adequate monitoring and assessment, to ensure the \nlinkage between investment and recurrent costs, and hence sufficient allocations. In accordance \nwith the gender action plan in Appendix 9, the Project will support (i) development and inclusion of \nfunding  criteria  to  include  gender,  poverty,  and  indigenous  considerations;  (ii)  preparation  of \ninclusive social development plans that incorporate an analysis of gender issues and plans for \naddressing them, including identifying barriers to boys\u2019 participation in education; and (iii) a study \nof policies targeting dormitory subsidies and cash transfers at poor rural households, in particular, \nfor boys.  \n \n25.  Midterm National ICT Strategy. The experience of other countries suggests that ICT is \noften more expensive than governments realize and that unplanned ICT developments may divert \nmoney away from other areas of educational need. Failure to provide sufficient operational budgets \nto  cover  hardware  replacement,  consumables,  and  other  recurrent  costs  could  lead  to  the \nwidespread non-use, under-use, or misuse of facilities. In addition to the important planning and \nfinancing aspects mentioned above, the ICT strategy for the sector should help to guide teaching \napproaches  and  ICT  arrangements  suitable  for  effective  use  in  Mongolian  schools.  Studies \nincreasingly emphasize the need to contextualize these arrangements to suit the circumstances of \neach individual country.17 Technologically highly sophisticated ICT arrangements may not always \nbe the most cost-efficient in terms of improving teaching and learning. Often less sophisticated, but \ninnovative and more appropriate approaches can add more value to learning, and be more cost-\nefficient and sustainable.  \n \n26.  The scale of the financial implications of ICT provision for the education system mean there \nis an urgent need for an ICT midterm strategy (5 years), detailing the cost implications for primary \nand secondary education. This should include (i) the legal framework; (ii) ICT objectives and \noutputs;  (iii)  curriculum  and  assessment\u2014encouraging  and  developing  ICT  skills  and \ncompetencies; (iv) short- and medium-term ICT policy and strategy; (v) minimum profiles and \ntarget ratios18 for computer hardware and peripherals; (vi) connectivity; (vii) content development \nstrategy\u2014software  and  websites  in  Mongolian  and  the  use  of  basic  applications  software  in \nsupport  of  subject  teaching  and  learning;  (viii)  teacher,  technician,  and  school  management \ntraining; (ix) maintenance and servicing strategies; (x) teacher support services; (xi) school local \narea network management requirements; (xii) school EMIS specifications; and (xiii) budget support \nand  operational  and  replacement  financing  requirements.  The  Project  will  finance  technical \nassistance and training in the techniques of national strategy development and the available \noptions; and the operational costs of a national ICT strategy working group, including a series of \nstrategy development workshops. \n \n   \n                                                 \n17 An IIREM project (TA on Innovative ICT in Education and Its Potential in Reducing Poverty in the Asia and Pacific \nRegion) in 2008 presented case study reports on several countries, including  Mongolia.  \n18 E.g., the minimum ICT hardware specifications such as number and type of computers, printers, UPS, scanners, \nprojectors, digital cameras, and minimum acceptable ratio of hardware to students. \n ", "  9\n2.   Component 2 : Strengthened Pre-Service Teacher Education \n \n27.  This component will improve the quality of provision and the outputs of the PSTT system to \nsupport to the launch of the new 12-year curriculum. An overview of TTIs is in Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n28.  Curriculum Reform. The current teacher education curriculum has not been reviewed or \nupdated since 2005\u20132006. It is overloaded and theoretical, with only 15% of the total credits \nrequired for bachelor programs being allocated to teaching practice. There are few opportunities to \nreinforce ideas and concepts across subjects. The Project will (i) initiate a teacher education \ncurriculum review to ensure conformity with the newly developed teacher standards, and (ii) assist \nMECS and TTIs to increase school-based teaching practice and the use of ICT in the curriculum.  \n \n29.  Comprehensive Quality Assurance System in TTIs. Low student entry qualifications in \nTTIs affect the quality of teacher graduates. Furthermore, the student assessment system is \npredominantly through written tests and oral examinations conducted by individual institutions \nwithout reference to national standards. These tests focus on students\u2019 ability to remember facts \nrather than to demonstrate skills gained during study and practice. The Project will assist TTIs and \nrelevant departments of MECS to (i) put in place national minimum admission standards and \nprocedures for all TTIs, (ii) implement a national student teachers assessment framework, and  \n(iii) support teacher educators in five TTIs to implement the quality assurance system. The Project \nwill also help to ensure that the quality assurance system is understood and applied across the \nsector. The Project will ensure that TTIs (i) take gender into account in teacher training curricula, \nmaterials, and courses; (ii) deliver gender-sensitive teaching to all student teachers in TTIs and to \nall teacher educators; (iii) develop selection criteria that include a focus on gender equity and \nencourage men to be student teachers in TTIs; and (iv) attract top students to TTIs and teachers to \nthe profession by ensuring attractive salaries and social benefits are in place, including incentives \nfor teachers in rural areas. \n \n30.  Continuous Professional Development (CPD). Increasing workloads and lack of funding \nfor CPD and research have affected teacher educators\u2019 professional development. Lack of foreign \nlanguages (particularly English) makes it difficult for them to learn about recent innovations in \nteacher training and new teaching methodologies, ideas, and approaches. The Project will help to \nstrengthen the CPD of teacher educators by (i) helping MECS and TTIs to adopt a funding \nmechanism for providing CPD to teacher educators; (ii) assisting TTIs to develop a professional \ndevelopment  planning  system,  including  conducting  training  needs  analysis;  (iii)  training  TTI \nadministrators and heads of departments in professional development planning; and (iv) training \nteacher educators in student-centered learning methods and assessment of student teachers\u2019 skills \nand competencies and using ICT. The Project will also support international institutional links and \nstaff attachment schemes.  \n \n31.  Teaching Practice. International experience indicates that teaching practice and school-\nbased training should be the cornerstone of teacher education. This is not the case in teacher \neducation programs in Mongolia, where content knowledge, educational theory, and practice are \ndelivered separately with an assumption that effective integration of these components will take \nplace in the minds of the students at a later stage. To support school-based teaching practice, the \nProject will (i) develop a conceptual and regulatory framework for a new school-based teaching \npractice model, (ii) develop operational guidelines for the new model, (iii) pilot the model in two \nTTIs in school years 2010\u20132011 and 2011\u20132012, and (iv) support full- scale implementation of the \nnew school-based teaching practice model starting in SY2012\u20132013. \n \n \n ", "10   \n  3.  Component 3: Improved Affordability, Quality, and Availability of Teaching \n  and Learning Materials \n \n32.  This  component  will  (i)  reduce  the  costs  and  improve  the  quality  and  availability  of \ntextbooks  and  teachers\u2019  guides  in  primary  schools;  and  (ii)  build  on  the  work  of  IIREM  by \ncontinuing the delivery of content, teaching methods, and information to poor schools in rural areas \nvia the cost-effective use of ICT.  \n \n33.  Design and Implementation of a Pilot Project. The pilot project will test the effectiveness \nof a textbook rental scheme and revolving fund in primary grades. The object will be to reduce the \nparental costs of education significantly and to increase textbook quality and durability. Adequate \navailability of textbooks is one of the most important factors in ensuring learning. Experience \nworldwide, and particularly in other countries in transition, has demonstrated that textbook rental \nsystems,  combined  with  long  textbook  life  achieved  through  mandatory  minimum  production \nspecifications, enables textbook origination and production costs to be amortized over at least 4 \nyears,  significantly  reducing  costs  to  parents.  Well-run  textbook  rental  schemes  are  widely \nacknowledged  to  be  the  least  costly  and  the  most  effective  and  equitable  form  of  textbook \nprovision.  These  systems  also  underpin  rapid  development  of  private  textbook  publishers  in \npartnership  with  Government  by  creating  a  reliable  and  predictable  textbook  market.  When \ncombined with a simple computerized textbook ordering system, the system eliminates the risk of \nwaste through lack of sales, thus reducing publishers\u2019 costs and hence prices to the schools. \nAppendix 11 contains an overview of textbook rental schemes and revolving funds.  \n \n34.  A textbook rental scheme and revolving funds will begin as a pilot in primary schools at \nselect aimags and, if successful, will be scaled up to other aimags. The component will (i) support \nthe design and implementation of a pilot textbook rental scheme and revolving funds in primary \ngrades; (ii) improve the targeting and transparent administration of  MECS support for poor and \nvulnerable children; (iii) provide training in all aspects of textbook conceptualization, authorship, \ndesign, and specification, including the specific requirements of textbooks and teachers\u2019 guides to \nsupport student-centered learning; (iv) review and reform the competitive textbook submission, \nevaluation, and contract award system to provide a transparent and timely system, oriented to \nproviding the highest quality and durability at the best prices; (v) provide financial support for the \ncompetitive procurement through school-based decision making of about 2 million textbooks for a \ncost reduction and quality upgrading pilot project, with a view to extending the pilot to the whole of \nthe primary sector if successful; (vi) fund consulting services and training to support the pilot \nproject; (vii) fund fully participatory meetings with parents and schools in all aimags in order to \ngenerate grassroots understanding and support for new textbook provision strategies; and (viii) \nfund the design and development of a simple computerized ordering system.   \n \n35.  Information Access to Poor Schools in Rural Areas. IIREM has made a good start on \ndeveloping strategies and materials specifically oriented to the needs of poor rural schools and it is \nproposed  that  the  Project  should  build  on  these  foundations.  The  Project  will  support  the \nestablishment of ICT centers of excellence in selected schools in rural and peri-urban ger areas, \nwith a focus on training and strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate ICT as a teaching and \nlearning  tool,  rather  than  on  the  ICT  hardware.  The  ICT  centers  of  excellence  will  facilitate \nunderstanding  among  teachers  of  the  benefits  of  technology  in  planning  their  lessons.  The \ncomponent  will  develop  and  disseminate  locally-applicable  models  using  student-centered \nmethodologies and technology. Such centers will encourage communities of educators to bring \ninnovation to teaching and learning. The component will build on the IIREM mentor schools and \nteachers\u2019 teams and will provide hands-on training and workshops to develop local capacity. It will \nalso support the authorship of manuals, guidelines, users\u2019 guides, and simple standard operating \nprocedures; the provision of some basic software applications; and the provision of basic hardware \npackages to enable schools to develop e-materials. It will also develop ICT in rural schools as a \n ", "  11\nmanagement tool and provide community access to ICT, particularly for nonformal education \npurposes. For this component, two groups of schools will be targeted. First, schools that were \nbeneficiaries of the IIREM project will be given priority, to ensure continuity of ICT training. Second, \nthe component will target schools where school management and MECS provide evidence that \nadequate budget will be made available for ICT operational expenses, and which have an existing \ntechnological infrastructure. This second group of schools will include schools in rural areas with at \nleast 30% of enrolled students from poor families and cluster schools, and at least one school in \naimags  with  a  high  proportion  of  ethnic  minorities,  such  as  Bayan-Olgiy.  In  order  to  keep \nadministration costs low, a maximum of five aimags will participate in the pilot. Project preparation \nincluded an investigation into Mongolian law relating to charities and charitable trusts and it is \nunderstood that a secure textbook revolving fund will qualify for charitable status.  \n \n36.  The  component  will  support  (i)  extension  of  the  use  of  ICT  in  the  delivery  of  new \napproaches to teaching and learning targeted at poor rural situations, including ICT training on the \nuse of the common software applications across all grades (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, \npresentation software, and databases); (ii) development of software in Mongolian aimed at teacher \ndevelopment through ICT skills upgrading; (iii) creation of a website to encourage collaboration and \nthe exchange of ideas and experiences between rural teachers; (iv) establishment of ICT centers \nof excellence which focus on strengthening the skills of teachers to integrate ICT into their teaching \nand on creating communities of educators; (v) development of a disk delivery system for schools \nwithout easy access to the Internet; and (vi) the inclusion of the pilot project as an integral part of \nthe  national  ICT  strategy  development  under  component  1.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  \n(i) textbooks, supplementary materials, ICT applications, and software do not stereotype genders \nor ethnic groups; and (ii) free textbooks are provided for poor and vulnerable families. \n \n4.  Component  4:  Upgraded  Facilities  at  Teacher  Training  Institutes  to  Support \nReforms in Pre-Service Teacher Training \n \n37.  This  component  will  improve  facilities  in  selected  TTIs  by  (i)  developing  technical \nspecifications  for  laboratory  equipment  and  instructional  manuals,  holding  workshops,  and \nsupplying  laboratory  equipment;  (ii)  supplying  furniture  and  equipment,  including  ICT;  \n(iii) rehabilitating facilities; and (iv) improving provision of teaching and learning resources. TTI \nlibraries  lack  modern  materials  on  new  teaching  technologies,  education  journals,  and  other \nresources that would facilitate and support independent learning of student teachers. The Project \nwill support: (i) a needs analysis of teaching and learning materials in four TTIs and the Mongolian \nState University of Education; (ii) authorship, design, and publication of a new generation of \nteacher  training  course  materials;  (iii)  production  and  supply  of  new  teacher  training  course \nmaterials; (iv) provision of Mongolian language abstracts of articles in international journals; and  \n(v) support for library stocks and ICT facilities. To improve the quality of teaching and learning in \nTTIs, some facilities will be upgraded and classroom furniture and ICT equipment will be provided \nto selected TTIs. Selection of the TTIs will prioritize: (i) state-run TTIs, (ii) TTIs in Ulaanbaatar and \nremote  aimags,  and  (iii)  TTIs  that  are  not  included  in  any  present  or  future  expansion  or \nrehabilitation program sponsored by any other agency. \n \n38.  Project  Management  Capacity  Enhanced.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  with \nprescribed monitoring and evaluation arrangements will oversee project operations. Transparency \n(with  appropriate  guidelines  and  processes)  will  be  built  into  all  project  activities  including  \n(i)  competitive  and  open  selection  procedures  for  consultants  and  project  staff,  (ii)  rigorous \ntendering arrangements for infrastructure and equipment contracting, (iii) mandatory performance \nand financial reporting, (iv) public reporting requirements for project activities, and (v) external \naudits and reviews. A website on project activities and outputs will be established and regularly \nupdated to ensure openness and public disclosure. \n \n ", "12   \nC.   Special Features \n \n39.  Innovative Approach to Education. Reforms in the management of educational financing \nwill improve efficiency and quality by ensuring that recurrent budgets are adequate, and will enable \nschool facilities and equipment to be used to their full potential. The focus on PSTT will create a \nstream of well-trained teachers with skills relevant to the new curriculum. The Project\u2019s innovations \nwill include (i) lowering costs and upgrading quality of learning and teaching materials, thereby \nreducing parental costs, increasing access, and improving education quality; and (ii) supporting the \neffective and innovative use of ICT in education, particularly in rural areas, by developing a \nnational ICT strategy for primary and secondary education and by establishing ICT centers of \nexcellence in selected schools in rural areas.   \n \n40.  Poverty Focus. The Project has a strong focus on poor and otherwise disadvantaged \npupils in remote rural areas. The cost of textbooks is a major reason for children not enrolling in \nschool or dropping out and the Project will significantly reduce these costs for parents. It will \nestablish adequate recurrent budgeting, which will reduce school demands for additional parental \ncontributions, another cause of dropouts among poor families. The ICT component will focus on \nthe use of ICT in poor schools in rural areas and ger districts in peri-urban areas.  \n \nD.   Project Investment Plan  \n \n41.  The project investment cost is estimated at $10,830,000, of which $10,000,000 will be \nfinanced from Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant funds and $830,000 by the Government in the \nform of taxes and duties (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounts\nA.

Project Financing Plan \n42.  The Government has requested grant financing of $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, representing 92.34% of the total project cost. The remaining $0.83 million equivalent or \n7.66% of total project cost will be provided by the Government in the form of taxes and duties. The \nfinancing plan is in Table 2, and detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n ", "  13\nGrant financing of the Project is considered justified because of its focus on primary and secondary \neducation and education sector reforms to close the rural\u2013urban gap in school participation and \neducational achievement, and because a part of the investment targets students in poor and \nremote areas. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \n \nAsian Development Bank  10.00    92.34 \nGovernment of Mongolia    0.83    7.66 \n  Total    10.83    100.00 \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.    Project Management  \n \n43.  MECS will be the executing agency for the Project. The implementation structure will be \nbased on the project implementation arrangements established under the ESDP and subsequently \nused successfully for the SEDP and TEDP. The PSC chaired by the state secretary of MECS will \ninclude senior officials of MOF and MECS and project aimag representatives will provide overall \nguidance. The PSC will meet quarterly and will be responsible for approving the annual project \nbudget and activity plan and for reviewing and advising on implementation progress. Working \ngroups to advise on and assist with project implementation will be established centrally and in pilot \nareas. The project implementation unit (PIU) responsible for the daily operation of the TEDP will \noversee and manage the work undertaken by the implementing agencies, overall management of \nproject finance, and project implementation. The PIU has been in place since the mid-1990s and \nthe  staff  are  very  experienced  in  procurement,  consultant  recruiting,  and  overall  project \nimplementation.  New  PIU  staff  whose  salaries  are  paid  from  the  grant  will  be  selected  and \ncontracted individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). Given the evolving SWAp in Mongolia\u2019s education sector, project \nmanagement needs to be well coordinated with financial planning and management at MECS. In \nthe long term, MECS\u2019s capacity to develop and manage an effective SWAp should increase and \nthere should be less dependence on traditional PIUs and more on the use of MECS\u2019s structures. \n \n2.    Implementation Period \n \n44.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 4 years from 2009 to 2013. The detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.    Procurement \n \n45.  All procurement shall be in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated to cost $0.5 million or more and \ncontracts for works estimated to cost $1 million or more shall be procured using international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and works estimated to cost less than \nthe above ICB thresholds but more than $100,000 shall be procured on the basis of national \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  Public  Procurement  Law  of \nMongolia, subject to modifications agreed with ADB. Contracts for goods and works estimated to \ncost $100,000 or less shall be procured using shopping procedures. For ICB invitations for bids, \ninvitations  for  prequalification,  draft  prequalification  documents,  draft  bidding  documents, \n ", "14   \nprequalification,  and  bid  evaluation  reports  are  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  prior  review  and \napproval. For NCB, the first draft English language version of the procurement documents should \nbe submitted for ADB review and approval regardless of the estimated contract amount. The ADB-\napproved procurement documents should then be used as a model for all NCB procurement \nfinanced by ADB for the Project, and need not be subjected to further review.  ADB will review the \nbid evaluation report and award of contract on a post-review basis. For shopping, ADB will review \nthe award of the contract on a post-review basis. MECS will develop distribution systems for \ntextbooks  and  learning  materials  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB  that  will  ensure  transparent \ndistribution of these goods to project beneficiaries, before disbursing the project funds for these \nitems. The procurement plan is in Appendix 6.  \n \n46.  Advance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB  has  approved  advance \ncontracting to expedite the award of civil works contracts and recruitment of the monitoring and \nevaluation consultants. It has also approved a request for retroactive financing for civil works and \nrehabilitation of TTI facilities and equipment. This is due to an urgent need to initiate these works \nas the construction season in Mongolia is short and to the currently dilapidated state of TTI \nfacilities as a result of limited government funding over the last 10 years. The requested retroactive \nfinancing is for eligible expenditures up to $1 million (equivalent to 10% of the ADB grant) incurred \nin  relation  to  civil  works  and  recruitment  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants  within  a \nmaximum of 12 months before the signing of the Grant Agreement. \n \n4.    Consulting Services \n \n47.  The Project will require a total of 18 person-months of international consulting services and \n150 person-months of national consulting services financed under the ADB grant. A consulting firm \nwill  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the \nstandard quality- and cost-based selection method (80% quality and 20% cost) and a simplified \ntechnical proposal. The international and national consultants will have expertise in (i) education \nfinance, management, and planning; (ii) textbook provision systems, cost reduction strategies, and \ntextbook publishing skills; (iii) development and implementation of national strategies for ICT in \neducation, the use of ICT as a learning and teaching tool and local language educational software \ndevelopment; (iv) all aspects of pre-service teacher training; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. \nCapacity building for the EA and the PIU will be achieved through consultant inputs, training \ncourses provided by universities, specialized institutes, and firms, and acquisition of additional \nequipment  financed  from  the  grant.  To  assist  the  EA  and  the  PIU  in  expediting  project \nimplementation, 3 person-months of national consulting services for monitoring and evaluation will \nbe engaged individually prior to recruitment of the consulting firm. MECS requested ADB for \nretroactive financing of up to $40,000 equivalent for expenditures incurred in the recruitment of \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Advance  contracting  will  include  advertising  the \npositions, review, and evaluation of candidates on a competitive basis, and clearance of the \nevaluation and the proposed selection. The Government was advised that approval of advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Indicative \nconsultancy requirements are in Appendix 7 and outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.   Anticorruption Policy \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in \nthe grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \n ", "  15\nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n  6.   Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n49.  The grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through the timely release of \ngrant proceeds, the PIU will establish an imprest account at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \nDisbursements  from  the  imprest  account  will  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal \napplication and related documentation. Such documentation will demonstrate, among other things \nthat the goods and/or services are (i) procured from ADB\u2019s member countries and (ii) eligible for \nADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed the \nestimated expenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure may be used to reimburse, liquidate, or replenish \neligible expenses that do not exceed $100,000. In addition, grant funds will be disbursed using \ndirect payment to the consultants or suppliers for civil works and equipment. \n \n  7.   Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n50.  The Government, through the PIU, will (i) maintain separate financial accounts for the \nProject,  and  (ii)  have  such  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited  annually  by \nindependent auditors acceptable to ADB in accordance with the provision of the Grant Agreement \nand as specified in ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank.19 \nThe auditors should have qualifications, experience, and terms of reference acceptable to ADB. \nThe use of the imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will also be part of the annual audit \nand a separate audit opinion will be submitted. The Government will submit to ADB certified copies \n(in English) of such audited accounts and financial statements and the related reports to auditors, \nwithin  6  months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  For  the  purpose  of  complying  with  the \nrequirements for the annual audited financial statements, the proceeds of this grant may be used \nto  finance  expenditures  for  private  financial  statements,  sector  auditors,  and  translations  of \nauditor\u2019s reports into English. The PIU will submit consolidated quarterly progress reports to ADB \n(in English) and to the Government on all aspects of project implementation. The reports will \ninclude details of overall implementation progress, problems encountered during the reporting \nperiod, measures taken or proposed to remedy these problems, and the proposed program of \nactivities for the following quarter. Within 3 months of project completion, the PIU will prepare and \nsubmit to ADB, in a format acceptable to ADB, a project completion report on (i) the utilization and \nimpact of the grant; (ii) performance of the project; (iii) economic and social benefits generated; \nand (iv) details about implementation, costs, and other information requested by ADB. \n \nG.  Project Performance Management System   \n \n51.  MECS will establish a comprehensive project performance management system (PPMS) \nacceptable to ADB. The PPMS will (i) assess project performance; (ii) evaluate delivery of planned \nactivities; (iii) measure project impacts; (iv) measure education, social, and economic benefits, \nfocusing on disadvantaged students from poor, remote, and rural areas; and (v) monitor progress \ntoward the Millennium Development Goals and other government targets. PPMS indicators will \nserve as a basis for reports on project implementation and the reform process, education quality \nand  access  to  education,  and  progress  toward  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Some \nindicators will be monitored by routine administrative and financial data. Where feasible, indicators \nwill be disaggregated by socioeconomic level and gender. The monitoring and evaluation specialist \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 1989. Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the Bank. Manila. \n ", "16   \nand consultant will assist MECS and PIU to determine project-specific indicators and to develop a \ncost-effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation system before implementation of the Project. \nTo ensure that the project outputs and ADB objectives, including inclusive growth and social \ndevelopment, are implemented, the Project will develop tools, including an e-tool for pro-poor \ngovernance to measure the impact of the project components. For the textbook reform component, \nbaseline and follow-up information will be collected from beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to \nmeasure impact and assess the costs and benefits of reforms.  \n   \nH.  Project Review \n \n52.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake reviews of the Project at least once a year. \nThe  reviews  will  assess  progress  in  each  component,  identify  issues  and  constraints,  and \ndetermine necessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted during \nthe  third  year  of  implementation.  This  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation \narrangements  and  identify  adjustments  required;  (ii)  assess  implementation  progress  against \nperformance  indicators;  and  (iii)  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation \narrangements, if necessary.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n53.  Project Benefits. The targeted outcome of the Project is an effective 12-year  school \nsystem that will have a positive impact on human capital development, poverty reduction, and \ninclusive  social  development.  The  close  link  between  educational  development  and  poverty \nreduction,  productivity  improvement,  economic  growth,  and  an  improvement  in  general  living \nconditions  is  well  established.  The  Project  focuses  on  quality  improvements  to  the  national \neducation system that will complete the transition of Mongolia\u2019s education system and improve \nenrollment and retention rates. The direct beneficiaries of the modernization of the education \nsystem will be all students enrolled in primary and secondary schools. Nationwide, about 540,000 \nstudents  and  their  parents  will  benefit  from  the  improved  affordability,  cost,  and  durability  of \ntextbooks and learning materials. About 110,000 students from poor families will benefit from better \ntargeting of free textbook provision under the Project. About 10,000 student teachers and 1,200 \nteacher educators throughout the country will benefit from improvements to PSTT in five TTIs and \nupgrading of teaching and learning facilities. Graduates of TTIs entering the teaching labor force \nwill be better equipped to improve education quality and to close the urban\u2013rural gap in education \nachievement.  Students  and  communities  in  rural  areas  will  benefit  from  the  ICT  centers  of \nexcellence. Better targeting of textbook provision and cheaper textbooks will enable poor students \nto  improve  their  educational  achievements.  It  will  also  reduce  dropout  rates  and  increase \nenrollment rates. Sound budgeting, planning, and financing in the education sector will enable \nmore efficient and effective delivery of services to overcrowded schools in Ulaanbaatar and to \ndeprived rural schools. Other specific project benefits include stronger planning and management \nat MECS and among local education staff, leading to an improved SWAp, and more capacity to \nplan and implement ICT investments. \n \n54.  Economic  Impacts.  The  Project  supports  the  education  system\u2019s  efforts  to  improve \neducation quality, access, effectiveness, and efficiency. Economic internal rates of return were \nderived for the Project; the main quantifiable benefits were future earnings and capacity. The most \nsignificant economic benefit will come from increases in future earnings of better educated school \ngraduates.  Capacity  building  assistance  for  MECS  in  areas  related  to  financial  analysis, \nmanagement, and budgeting will help to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of \neducation services and will reduce transaction costs. Public expenditure on education as a share \nof gross domestic product is projected to average 6.5% in the period 2009\u20132012. It can be \nassumed that the budget will be sufficient to continue education service delivery at the current rate \nand to finance the modernization of the system. The Government\u2019s share in the Project is included \n ", "  17\nin the budget. Based on a projection of education expenditure, it can be assumed that the Project \nis financially sustainable (Appendix 3 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n55.  Poverty Reduction and Social Dimensions. Poverty and education are strongly related, \nand better education services are an important contribution to human and economic development. \nOne  of  the  most  persistent  issues  in  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  is  a  rural\u2013urban  gap  in \neducation quality, educational achievement, school participation, and dropout rates. Children in \nrural areas tend to be left out of upper secondary schooling because of a combination of lack of \naccess and limited household funds. Poverty contributes to dropout rates directly, through out-of-\npocket and opportunity costs, and indirectly, through parental background. Rural students who \ntend to perform worse and drop out after the 8th grade are highly likely to be poor. High dropout \nrates reinforce the vicious cycle of inter-generational transmission of poverty. Dropout rates for \nboys at secondary level are high among poor families in urban areas while, in rural areas, children \ndrop out even at primary level. Specific pro-poor and social development measures of the Project \ninclude lower education costs for parents and greater use of ICT as a teaching and learning tool, \nparticularly in rural schools. Therefore, the Project will support the Government in its efforts to \nimprove the existing system to reduce urban\u2013rural disparities. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 8. According to the ADB and World Bank Mongolia country gender \nassessment (2005),20 schoolgirls outnumber schoolboys in every aimag, including Ulaanbaatar. \nThe Project will directly benefit all teachers through its training programs, which are expected to \nenhance the attractiveness of the teaching profession. Over 90% of teachers are female so the \nProject will encourage more men to work as basic education teachers. This will enable children to \nbroaden their role models, which is particularly important given the poor school attendance and \nhigher dropout rates of boys. The Project will also help to present gender roles and issues under \nthe PSTT component. The gender action plan is in Appendix 9. More generally, the Project will \nencourage parents  to send  their children  to school  through  the  provision  of  textbooks,  more \nqualified teachers, and lower costs for parents.  \n \n56.  Ethnic Minority Issues. Kazakhs are the most significant ethnic minority in Mongolia and \naccounted for 4.4% of the total population in 2002. They retain a distinct cultural identity, which is \nrecognized under Article 8 of the Mongolian Constitution, which allows Kazakhs to use their native \nlanguage in education, communication, and the pursuit of cultural and scientific activities. At the \nsame time, Kazakhs practice a pastoral, nomadic lifestyle similar to the ethnic majority Khalk in \nrural areas. Basic education and literacy rates are similar across ethnic groups, although some \ndifferences  in  levels  of  secondary  school  attendance  are  beginning  to  emerge.  Geographical \nisolation and poverty appear to affect ethnic minorities\u2019 educational attainment rather than their \nmembership of a minority culture. Improvements in educational provision under the Project will \ntherefore  be  similar  for  ethnic  minorities  and  the  Khalk  majority.  The  Project  will  (i)  support \ntranslation of textbook and educational software into the Kazakh language; and (ii) select at least \none school in Bayan-Olgiy aimag for the ICT subcomponent, as reflected in the gender action plan, \nin Appendix 9. \n \n57.  Environmental Aspects. The Project will rehabilitate existing TTI buildings and facilities. \nNo land acquisition is required and there will be no negative environmental or resettlement impact. \nThe Project is classified as category C for the environmental aspect. \n \n58.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. With no planned land acquisition, the Project is \nunlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy.  \n \n59.  Project Assumptions. The major project assumptions are (i) favorable economic growth in \nMongolia; (ii) continued funding and support of education by the Government; and (iii) acceptance \n                                                 \n20  ADB and World Bank. 2005. Mongolia: Country Gender Assessment. Manila. \n ", "18   \nof policy and legislative changes by decision makers, key stakeholders, and the community at \nlarge. Other assumptions include: (i) staff trained under the Project will remain in the education \nsystem  after  their  qualifications have  been  upgraded;  and  (ii)  an  improved  curriculum,  better \nteachers, and lower costs for parents will increase enrollment and attendance rates. \n \n60.  Risks and Mitigation Measures. At present, managerial and technical capacity at MECS \nis limited and this may affect the smooth transition to a 12-year school system. This risk will be \nmitigated through training and capacity building under the Project. High turnover of officials and \nsenior staff in key agencies resulting in slow progress or resistance of reforms is also a risk. The \nrisk of high turnover of officials will be mitigated through government assurances that confirm its \ncommitment  to  education  reforms  and  by  adopting  a  stakeholder  participatory  approach  and \nbuilding core technical and management capacity in MECS through the Project and the ADB-\nfunded  SWAp  TA.  Allegations  of  corruption  in  the  selection  and  procurement  of  textbooks, \nincluding the approval, publishing, and distribution of textbooks may pose another risk. However, \nthis will be mitigated through training and consultative workshops with key stakeholders and by \ncapacity building under the Project.    \n \nV.    ASSURANCES \n \n61.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  provide  all  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation on time. The Government will make timely submission of annual \nbudgetary appropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriate \nfunds during each year of project implementation. \n(ii)  Within 2 years of grant effectiveness, MECS will have developed, approved, and \nintroduced a new PSTT curriculum. The Government will ensure that all curricula in \nthe five TTIs will conform to the same program standards and will not vary in \nstructure. \n(iii)  Within 2 years of grant effectiveness, MECS will have approved budgeting and \nplanning reforms, including its related MIS and have prepared a time-bound action \nplan  for  these  reforms,  and  that  by  the  midterm  review,  implementation  has \nprogressed to full institutionalization of these reforms.  \n(iv)  Within 6 months of the effectiveness of the Grant Agreement, the Government will \nensure that the PPMS will have been established. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that (a) evaluation, selection, and performance criteria \nfor bidders and contractors respectively have been clearly identified in a consultative \nmanner and rigorously applied; (b) tender and evaluation committee members have \nappropriate procurement, professional, or technical qualifications or experience to \nevaluate the tenders and have been provided with relevant and appropriate training \nin evaluation techniques; (c) inspection and supervision of contractor performance \nwill be strengthened and only products/works that fulfill the contract requirements \nwill be accepted; and (d) the anticorruption action plan and codes of ethics and \nintegrity are  developed and implemented. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that the Project will be implemented in accordance with \nthe gender action plan. \n(vii)  By the end of the second year of project implementation, MECS will have developed \na 5-year strategy and policy for ICT in education and relevant authorities will have \napproved such a plan. The approved plan will include clear budgetary allocations for \nthe total costs of ownership of ICT hardware investments in the education sector. By \nthe end of the second year of project implementation, MECS will have developed a \n ", "  19\ntime-bound action plan for implementation of the ICT strategy in the education \nsector. \n(viii)  By the end of the first year of project implementation, MECS will have developed a \ntime-bound action plan for enhancing textbook production and provision, by the \nsecond year, MECS will have commenced implementation of the action plan for \nenhancing textbook production and provision based on the pilot system, and within \nthe  6  months  after  the  pilot  implementation  for  the  textbook  enhancement  is \ncompleted, MECS will have evaluated the pilot project.

Structure of the Education System \n \n1.  The education system in Mongolia is based on 11 years of general education. According \nto Clause 7.2 of the Law on Education, with effect from school year (SY) 2008\u20132009, the \nsystem will move to a 12-year school system, and the school entry age will be lowered from 7 to \n6 years. About 43,000 6-year-olds are expected to join the formal education system in 2008. \nPrimary and lower secondary education is compulsory. Primary education will include grades 1\u2013\n6. Lower secondary education will include grades 7\u201310 and upper secondary education will \ninclude grades 11\u201312. The Constitution stipulates free basic education to all children. \n \n2.  Only half of Mongolian children receive any form of early childhood education1 and \nenrollment of children in rural areas and children from herder families in preschool programs is \nparticularly low. In 2006, 58.1% of children 2\u20136 years of age were enrolled in preschools and \nkindergartens. In 2007\u20132008, 92.7% of the primary school age group was enrolled in primary \nschools.  Secondary  education  enrollment  was  86.8%.  Net  enrollment  rate  for  primary  and \nsecondary education was 89.9%. \n \n3.  In SY2007\u20132008 there were 754 general education schools in Mongolia with a total \n542,505 students. According to Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MECS) statistics \nthere were 23,778 teachers employed in general education schools, of which 22,891 were full \ntime teachers. The average teacher to student ratio is 25.5.2 The shortage of teachers in \nSY2006\u20132007 was 479 with the highest number of vacancies in Ulaanbaatar schools. Of the \n754 general education schools in SY2007\u20132008, 210 were in Ulaanbaatar and the remainder \nschools were located in aimags. Of the total, 71 schools were primary only, 167 were grades 1\u2013\n10, and 516 were grade 1\u201311. Most schools taught in Mongolian, although in Bayan-Olgiy \nschools offered instruction in the Kazakh language. \n \n4.   A total of 495 boarding schools enrolled 44,037 students in SY2007\u20132008 (about 8% of \nthe overall student population), of which 38,255 were herders\u2019 children. Overall, 51,118 students \nwere willing to live in dormitories, although demand exceeded supply and many students were \nforced to live in rented accommodation or with relatives in order to attend school. \n \n5.  MECS administers vocational education and training and the Ministry of Social Welfare \nand  Labor  administers  short  courses  that  offer  vocational  and  specialization  certificates. \nAccording  to  MECS  statistics,  in  SY2007\u20132008,  there  were  56  technical  and  vocational \ninstitutions, with a total of 29,906 students, of whom 13,835 were female. In primary vocational \ninstitutions  29,109  students  were  enrolled,  of  whom  13,498  were  female.  In  secondary \nvocational institutions 797 students were enrolled, of whom 337 were female. \n \n6.  In academic year 2007\u20132008, there were 162 higher education institutions in Mongolia \ncomprising  43  state-owned  higher  education  institutions  and  four  state-owned  vocational \neducation and training centers, 109 private institutions, and six branches of foreign universities. \nStudent enrollments have tripled from about 33,000 to over 150,000 since the withdrawal of \nSoviet financial support in 1991.

The  gender  differential  in  both  state  and  private \ninstitutions has not changed, with 61% of students being female. The percentage of women in \nstate institutions has remained constant at about 60%.  \n \nB.  Challenges and Constraints in the Education System \n \n7.  Mongolia began a standards-based curriculum reform in 1998 and began standardized \ntesting a year later. Secondary education standards were introduced in 2003. These emphasize \nthe importance of comprehensive skills\u2014learning to know, learning to perform, and learning to \nsocialize. General subject areas include science and technology and English. While these \nstandards are consistent with the acquisition of skills that are needed for work and life, the \ncurrent curriculum and teaching practices are not very consistent with these goals.  \n \n8.  The school curriculum and teaching methods have not kept up with the new demands in \nthe labor market. The curriculum continues to be too theoretical and is focused on traditional \nacademic subjects, while teaching continues to be teacher-centered rather than interactive. It \nencourages memorization rather than critical and creative thinking and individual learning rather \nthan teamwork. While information and communications technology (ICT) and English language \nsubjects are part of the curriculum, teachers are generally not well prepared to teach these \nsubjects. In many cases, the teaching of ICT is limited by the poor availability of computers in \nschools and inadequate operational budgets. The teaching of thinking and behavioral skills can \nbe integrated into every aspect of the curriculum through discovery-oriented teaching methods \nthat include interactive learning, applying knowledge to real-life problems, integrating teamwork \nand peer tutoring into the learning process, and inviting student input into the structure and \nsubject  matter  of  lessons.  However,  these  methodologies  require  trained  teachers  and \nadequate classroom facilities to make them effective in terms of delivery new  educational \noutputs. \n \n9.  The implementation of student-centered learning will take time and require substantial \ninvestments in pre- and in-service training. In the short run, teaching life skills as a separate \nsubject (e.g., health, citizenship, or financial literacy education) may be a practical option. To \nimprove teaching, teachers also should have adequate materials and should conduct routine \nassessments of student progress, focusing on their ability to use the knowledge acquired. The \nGovernment is currently developing such a national assessment system for primary education.  \n \n10.  Rationalizing Education Sector Facilities. A systematic restructuring of education \ninstitutions was undertaken under the ADB-funded Education Sector Development Project. This \naimed to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the education system during the \n1990s, the most severe period of transition. In the mid-1990s school attendance was poor, \nmany schools were dysfunctional, and teachers were not paid for months (at that time the \nmaximum monthly salary was MNT24,500).3 A nationwide school mapping study was completed \nin April 1997 and a plan was prepared for comprehensive school rationalization. Of the 171 \nschools identified for restructuring, 136 (80%) were restructured by August 1998 and 35 (20%) \nwere restructured by June 2002. One of the major outputs was the development of \u201ccomplex \nschools,\u201d a rationalization initiative that brought several adjacent neighborhood schools under \ncommon management. In 2007, about 20% of students and 21% of teachers and school service \nstaff of Ulaanbaatar were in complex schools. The model is now considered to be a blueprint for \nthe development of primary and secondary education services in urban areas, as these schools \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007. Program Performance Evaluation Report on the Education Sector Development Program in Mongolia. \nManila. \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \ngenerally  have  more  efficient  management  and  better  facilities  and  equipment  than  other \nschools.  At  the  same  time,  rural  students  do  not  have  equal  access  to  upper  secondary \neducation. A number of rural schools closed their upper secondary classes during the school \nreorganization  and  rationalization reform  in  1997,  while  aimag  complex  schools  have  only \nlimited  numbers  of  upper  secondary  spaces.  An  assessment  of  the  outcomes  from  the \nrationalization and reorganization reform suggests that these reforms may have perpetuated the \nwidening gaps in educational outcomes between urban (aimag center and capital city) and rural \n(soum and bagh) schools, exacerbated the problems of access to senior secondary education, \nand possibly contributed to migration from rural areas.  \n \n11.  Teacher Training Institutes. The Mongolian State University of Education (MSUE), the \nMongolian National University, the University of Social Sciences, and four teachers colleges are \nthe major teacher training institutes (TTIs) of Mongolia. In rural areas there are universities in \nKhovd, Bayan-Olgiy, Arkhangai, and Dornod aimags. These universities and colleges prepare \nabout 2,800 teachers annually and over 40% of them will continue to offer teacher training in \nearly childhood education, primary and secondary schools, and the technical and vocational \neducation and training sector. The MSUE is the largest TTI in Mongolia. It consists of 12 \nschools and four teacher training colleges.4 Two TTIs are in Ulaanbaatar; one trains teachers for \nprimary schools and the other specializes in preschool education. MSUE is the only institution \nthat covers all levels of teacher training including preschool, primary and secondary education, \nand higher education. Currently 8,000 students are enrolled in MSUE, of whom 600 are in \nmaster programs and 300 in doctoral programs. MSUE employs 450 lecturers and 200 non-\nteaching staff. About 50% of faculty members hold advanced academic and scientific degrees. \nMSUE offers 4-year bachelor programs in more then 50 specializations. About 70% of teachers \ncurrently working in primary and secondary schools are MSUE graduates. MSUE and two of the \nteacher training colleges annually produce about 1,400 graduates, about 50% of the total \nnumber of teacher graduates from TTIs in Mongolia. The Preschool Teacher Training College \ncurrently has 952 students and 26 teaching staff. It offers a 2-year course called Teacher and \nMethodologist. About 100 students graduate every year, and according to the management of \nthe TTI, 70% of them continue with a teaching career.  \n \n12.  There  is  a  decreasing  interest  in  teacher  training  courses  in  the  TTIs  outside \nUlaanbaatar, which now have problems in recruiting sufficient numbers of students to continue \nrunning teacher training courses. As a result, provision of teacher education programs is no \nlonger considered to be a profitable or sustainable business.  \n \n13.  Vocational Education. Vocational education does not yet serve the real needs of the \nlabor market. Upper secondary and tertiary education need to accommodate diverse student \nneeds, interests, and capabilities. Vocational education therefore should be part of a diverse \nsystem  of  learning  options.  Vocational  education  can  be  accessed  after  completing  lower \nsecondary  or  upper  secondary,  while  technical  education  requires  an  upper  secondary \neducation.  Vocational  and  technical  education  in  Mongolia  accounts  for  only  9%  of  total \nenrollment in post-basic education, which reflects the heavy bias of post-basic education toward \nacademic university degrees. The system also needs sufficient flexibility to allow students to \nexperiment and develop their full potential. While technical education is fully integrated with \nhigher education, vocational education in Mongolia has no connection with technical colleges or \nthe academic education track (secondary and higher education). \n \n                                                 \n4  Originally, five teacher training colleges were attached to MSUE but the TTI in Dornod has now become an \nindependent HEI.  \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n14.  Higher Education. Currently, higher education institutions do not fully serve the needs \nof the knowledge economy. Universities have been subject to an accreditation system since \n1998,  but  this  system  is  not  obligatory  and  is  considered  to  be  weak  in  terms  of  the \nassessments performed. In addition to introducing more student-centered teaching practices \nand more practical programs, the higher education system needs to be more flexible. Open \nsystems  can  facilitate  student  mobility  by  recognizing  relevant  prior  experience,  degree \nequivalences, and credits earned elsewhere. A well-designed and unified system of higher \neducation admission tests is beneficial, because educating the most capable students can \nfoster innovation, thus driving reforms and progress in the economy. \n \nC.  New 12-Year Education Structure \n \n15.  The new 12-year education structure was introduced into schools in September 2008. It \nreplaced the previous 11-year structure, which itself was introduced only in 2005. The new 12-\nyear structure will bring Mongolia in line with an increasing number of former socialist countries \nwho are now opting for 12-year systems. \n \n16.  The new 12-year system poses a number of challenges for the education system in \nMongolia. For example, there are many who complain that the system has not yet properly \nadjusted to the introduction of the 11-year system in 2005 and that introducing a 12-year system \nin 2008 may be too hasty. The many problems that need to be resolved include the following.   \n \n(i)  The need to provide additional classroom, kitchen, and dormitory facilities that \nare both age- and gender-sensitive. Because the education structure will be \nexpanded downwards and 6-year-olds will be accepted into primary schools for \nthe first time, there is a need to provide additional classroom and dormitory \nspace  plus  chairs,  desks,  shelving,  and  lavatory  and  washing  facilities \nappropriate to the age and size of the children concerned. \n(ii)  The enrollment of young children (7-year-olds from 2005 and 6-year-olds from \n2008) requires a substantial program of both in-service and pre-service teacher \ntraining to prepare teachers with new skills in (a) early childhood education and \nthe development of early literacy in particular, (b) the demands of the new 12-\nyear curriculum, (c) new teaching methods and approaches to deliver the new \nmethodological approaches specified as part of the new curriculum, and (d) the \nachievement of new skills and competency based learning outputs.  \n(iii)  The  12-year  system  requires  the  previous  curriculum  to  be  amended  to \naccommodate 6-year-olds. Teacher training is dependent upon the availability of \nthe new curriculum.   \n(iv)  New learning and teaching materials and supplementary reading books are all \nrequired and have to be written and delivered on schedule. \n \nD.   Financing of Education \n1.  Economic and Budget Forecasts \n17.  Best  practices  in  transitional  economies  have  indicated  that  expenditure  for  the \neducation sector ranges between 4% and 8% of national gross domestic product (GDP) and \nbetween  10%  and  20%  of  total  public  expenditure.  Using  these  comparative  indicators, \nMongolia can be regarded as having paid significant attention to its education sector. Actual \neducation sector expenditure accounted for 5.1% of total national GDP in 2006 and 4.9% in \n2007. It accounted for 15.3% of total public expenditure in 2006 and 13.4% in 2007.

Based on the current economic outlook, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has submitted \nthe national 2008 budget to the parliament, which has approved it. The budget for the education \nsector in 2008 is MNT386 billion, accounting for 15.1% of total public expenditure and 6.7% of \nnational  GDP.  Discussions  with  the  MOF  indicated  that  the  budget  was  based  on  the \nassumption that (i) prices of copper and gold in international markets will remain high, and  \n(ii) the nominal GDP growth rate will be 20.2% at year-end 2008. \n \n19.  For the proposed period of implementation of the Education Sector Reform Project \n(assuming 4 years between 2009 and 2013) and thereafter (2014\u20132021), a nominal annual \nGDP growth rate of 15.0% has been assumed by the project preparatory TA team in order to \nestimate the national nominal GDP, while local economists and policy makers revealed that they \nwould  be  more  optimistic.  Based  on  this  assumption,  education  sector  expenditure  would \nremain at an acceptable and maintainable level, at about 5% of national GDP and in the range \nof 14.3%\u201317.2% of total public expenditure during and after project implementation (See Tables \nA2.2 and A2.3). \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.2: Education Budget Expenditure (Post-Project Implementation) \nPost-Project Implementation \nYear 7  Year 8  Year 9  Year 10  Year 11  Year 12  Year 13 \nExpenditure  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021 \nGDP in Current Prices   19,643  22,589  25,977  29,874  34,355  39,508  45,434 \n(MNT billion) \nGDP Growth Rate   15  15  15  15  15  15  15 \n(% nominal) \nPublic Expenditure   6,089  7,916  10,291  13,378  17,391  22,609  29,391 \n(MNT billion) \nPublic Expenditure as % of  30  30  30  30  30  30  30 \nGDP \nEducation  Sector  Budget  982  827  910  1,001  1,101  1,211  1,333 \n(MNT billion) \nEducation  Sector  Budget  5  5  5  5  5  5  5 \nas % of GDP \nEducation  Sector  Budget  16.1  10.4  8.8  7.5  6.3  5.4  4.5 \nas % of Public Expenditure \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on the Ministry of Finance\u2019s 2008 draft budget. \n \n20.  Recentralization of Education Financing. The Government recentralized education \nfinancing in 2002. The tasks of consolidating school budgets and preparing the sector\u2019s budget \nproposal were assigned to MECS, and budget disbursement was assigned to MOF, through a \nnewly created treasury office. As a result of these changes, education finance officers were \nappointed as provincial representatives of the Economics and Finance Department of MECS, \nbased  at  aimag  education  and  culture  departments.  Treasury  officers  from  MOF  were \ntransferred to aimag treasury offices. In addition, schools were allowed to have only one budget \naccount to which the aimag treasury offices would have direct access. The purpose of this \nreform was to simplify processes and increase transparency in school accounting. \n \n21.  Recentralization has not occurred in one-third of schools (those in Ulaanbaatar). This is \ninconsistent with the law, which was meant to restructure education financing nationally. While \nin other aimags, MECS and MOF provincial staff have separate roles in budget preparation and \ndisbursement respectively, the treasury office in Ulaanbaatar still performs both functions. As a \nresult, the treasury office submits aggregate information on school budgets directly to MECS. \nUnlike the provincial offices, the treasury office in Ulaanbaatar is accountable to the office of the \nmayor (rather than to MECS or MOF). Schools in Ulaanbaatar are also waived from applying \nthe revised school funding formula. The case of Ulaanbaatar is less a problem of education \nfinance and more of accountability and control. The chances of leaks are greater in a system in \nwhich approval and disbursement are administered by the same agency, and where there are \nno uniform processes of monitoring and evaluation in place.  \n \n22.  Schools prepare 3-year budget strategies in the spring of every year, and submit a \ndetailed budget proposal based on the current fiscal year\u2019s budget norms to the finance officer \nof the aimag Education and Culture Department by 1 July every year. The requirement for 3-\nyear  budget  proposals  to  be  submitted  by  schools  is  likely  to  be  removed  because  it  is \nconsidered to be unrealistic. Discussions with MOF and MECS officials revealed that school \nprincipals and accountants need to be trained to prepare these budgets and to receive a \nrefresher course every 2 years. In particular, they need to be trained to account for both variable \nand fixed costs in the school expenditure line items. In July of each year, all finance officers \n ", "Appendix 2  29 \nmeet for 2 weeks in the finance office of MECS in Ulaanbaatar to prepare budget proposals in \nthe official format. At this stage, and based on student numbers, reallocations may occur, \naffecting how the budget is distributed between variable and fixed costs. School budgets for the \nfollowing fiscal year are based on budget norms formulated in the fourth quarter of the previous \nyear. Since the budget norms are adjusted upwards annually, overall budgets for schools \nprepared at the central level are often higher than those submitted by the Education and Culture \nDepartment finance officers.  \n \n2.  Approved 2008 Budget \n23.  The expenditure on education, culture, and science in 2008 was approved at MNT386.6 \nbillion, an increase of MNT151.8 billion or 65% compared with 2007. Of this amount, 17% \n(MNT64.3 billion) is for preschool education, 48% (MNT185.4 billion) for general education, 7% \n(MNT27.7 billion) for vocational education, 10% (MNT39.5 billion) for higher education, 6% \n(MNT23.4 billion) for culture and arts, 3% (MNT12.8 billion) for science, and 9% (MNT33.4 \nbillion) for other educational organizations (Table A2.3).  \n \nTable A2.3: Budget Composition of the Education, Culture, and Science Sector \nSubsector  2006 (actual)  2007 (actual)  2008 (approved) \nNursing schools  519.4  693.6 \n64,345.2 \nKindergartens  29,177.5  39,778.0 \nGeneral education schools  96,447.6  119,792.6  185,397.1 \nVocational training centers  8,791.7  15,110.2  27,761.2 \nUniversities and colleges  24,633.9  0.0  39,491.6 \nOther educational organizations  21,293.0  36,071.5  33,391.7 \nCulture and arts organizations  11,289.0  15,645.5  23,482.7 \nScientific organizations  6,679.5  7,706.4  12,816.7 \nTotal  198,831.6  234,797.8  386,686.2 \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n3.  Financial Implications of the 12-Year General Education Structure  \n24.  As from SY2008\u20132009, according to Clause 7.2 of the Law on Education, MECS will \nshift from the 11-year school system to a 12-year system, with the enrollment of 6-year-old \nchildren  into  grade  1.  This  will  require  additional  finance  to  cover  building  of  schools, \ndormitories, classroom and dormitory furniture, and related facilities; training teachers; and \nprinting more textbooks and teaching materials. Operational costs for schools (both variable and \nfixed) are also expected to increase. \n \n25.

It is forecast that in SY2008\u20132009, grade I enrollment will be 68,803, including 43,029  \n6-year-old children and 25,774 7-year-old children. The 43,029 6-year-old children will need \n1,229 classrooms and 1,229 teachers, based on the MECS target of 35 pupils per class and per \nteacher. The public investment program is financing the construction of 122 classrooms in 2008. \nThe remaining 1,107 classrooms will need to be constructed at a unit cost of $7,000 per \nclassroom. It is estimated that only 40% of the 1,229 teachers needed are readily available for \n6-year-old pupils in 2008. The other 60% (738 teachers) will need to be trained at an average \ncost per teacher of $3,000. It is assumed that 40% of the 6-year-old children will be from poor \nand  disadvantaged  households  will  therefore be  provided  with  books  at  the  Government's \nexpenses. The cost of items such as dormitory rooms, beds, and sinks were estimated as per \ndiscussions with MECS and validated by market data. Incremental operational costs, including \nvariable and fixed costs, were estimated at 22% of the total 2008 one-off incremental costs, \nbased on historic cost. \n \n27.  The projections were made from 2008 to 2015, the end of the transitional period. The \ntotal  incremental  cost  of  shifting  to  the  12-year  system  is  estimated  to  be  $27.7  million \n(MNT32.4 billion), including $22.7 million as an incremental one-off cost and $4.9 million as \nincremental operational costs for 2008. The incremental operational costs are projected to \nremain unchanged in most of the other years, except that for SY2013\u20132014 when capital \nreplacement costs are included for classrooms and dormitories that will have been in operation \nfor 5 years. \n \n ", " \nFigure A2: Problem Tree Analysis: Mongolia\u2019s Education System  \nSlower Economic Growth  Slower Human Development \nWeak Labor Force  Lack of General Knowledge and \n  Qualifications of Graduates \nLack of Quality and Relevance of Primary \nand/or Secondary Education \nSchool  Education  Governance  Learning  School  Pre-Service \nStructure  Financing  and  Resources and  Facilities  Teacher \n    Management  Inputs    Training \n\u2022 Transition to  \u2022 Insufficient school  \u2022 Need to further  \u2022 Increasing  \u2022 Inadequate  \u2022  Pre-service \n12-year  operation and  improve sector  parental  school facilities  teacher training \ncompulsory  maintenance budget  strategic  contributions to  for 6-year-olds,  curriculum \neducation  \u2022 High-cost investments  planning and  schooling  including lack of  needs to be \nsystem  in information and  management  \u2022 High cost and low  age-appropriate  modernized \n\u2022 Need to reflect  communications  \u2022 Need to better  durability of  water and  \u2022 Need for quality \nthe new state  technology (ICT)  target  textbooks  sanitation  assurance at \neducation  hardware without  disadvantaged  \u2022 Poorly organized  facilities   teacher training \nstandards and  midterm ICT strategy  groups including  distribution of free  \u2022 Insufficient  institutes (TTIs)  \nthe curriculum  and budget  pupils in poor,  textbooks to poor  dormitory  \u2022 Need to \nin the teaching  \u2022 Inconsistencies in  rural areas, and  students  spaces and the  enhance \nand learning   budget approval and  boys  \u2022 Need to develop  need to improve  continuous \nmaterials  disbursement following  \u2022 Need to calculate  educational  dormitory  professional \nincluding  recentralization in  total cost of  software in  spaces to  development for \ntextbooks  2002  ownership of ICT  Mongolian  accommodate  teacher \n  \u2022 Inadequate capital  and make  language  younger pupils  educators in \ninvestments  adequate budget  \u2022 Need to enhance  \u2022 Poor quality  TTIs \ninvestments in  innovation in  learning  \u2022 Need to \nICT  education by  environments  increase and \n  further introducing  improve \nICT as a teaching  teaching \nand learning tool  practice policy  A\np\n  and  p\nimplementation  en\nstrategy  d\nix\n 2\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n3\n1\n \n ", "32   Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MONGOLIAN EDUCATION SECTOR \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia has been receiving external assistance for the education \nsector since early 1990s. The Government of Japan is a major bilateral donor, providing grants \nfor renovation and upgrading of primary and secondary schools, strengthening teacher training, \nand information and communication technology (ICT) in education. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) is continuing to support education sector reforms through concessional loans and \ntechnical assistance. The Government has signed the largest compact in the history of the \nMillennium  Challenge Corporation  (MCC),  part  of  which  will  be  devoted  to  developing  the \nvocational training system in Mongolia. Under the Education for All-Fast Track Initiative, in joint \ncollaboration  with  World  Bank  and  ADB,  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Culture,  and  Science \n(MECS) is improving access to basic education and enhancing the quality of its services. The \nWorld  Bank  is  helping  to  establish  classroom  libraries  in  383  soum  and  bagh  schools, \nconducting teacher training through professional development networks and improving national \nmonitoring of quality and efficiency under the Rural Education Support Project financed from an \nInternational Development Association grant. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) \nand World Vision are active in preschool, primary, and secondary education. The European \nCommission and Save the Children UK are supporting quality preschool and basic education \nand building the capacity of civil society to advocate for access to education for children with \ndisabilities. German technical cooperation provides assistance for demand-oriented vocational \ntraining, especially for the building trade (in cooperation with ADB and the Japan Fund for \nPoverty  Reduction).  Overall,  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  development  has \nsignificantly increased in the last few years. Most has been in the form of grants.  \n \n2.  To  enhance  harmonization  and  coordination  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  external \nassistance,  the  Government  and  the  donor  community  agreed  to  establish  a  sector-wide \napproach (SWAp) in the education sector. The Education Donors\u2019 Consultative Mechanism \n(EDCM) is now is fully operational and is co-chaired by ADB and the Government of Japan. One \nof the key components for implementing the SWAp in the education sector is to develop a \ncomprehensive short-term plan reflecting key objectives and strategies of education sector \ndevelopment and enhance the integration of the Government\u2019s education initiatives and those of \nfunding agencies. To implement the Master Plan to Develop Education in Mongolia, the SWAp \nteam has developed a comprehensive 2008 annual implementation plan, in close consultation \nwith EDCM and MECS. This plan highlights partnership arrangements between the Government \nand funding agencies and provides a detailed outline of priority investment areas and targeted \nactivities within the framework of the new master plan.  \n \n3.  Total current external funding to the education sector is estimated at $179.6 million, with \n$26.7 million projected to be spent in 2008. Financing is provided by 10 funding agencies \nthrough 20 outstanding projects. Of the total financing, 57% is expected to come from bilateral \nagencies, 23% from international organizations, 16% from the Education for All-Fast Track \nInitiative, and 4% from international nongovernment organizations. The Government of Japan is \nproviding 62% of all bilateral assistance and MCC financing accounts for 25%. ADB and the \nEducation for All-Fast Track Initiative are among the biggest sources of funding for the country's \neducation sector and provide the majority of the funds from the international organizations. \nInternational nongovernment organizations such as Save the Children UK and World Vision \nhave  also  increased  their  contributions.

National Competitive Bidding. The procedures to be followed for national competitive \nbidding shall be those set forth in the Public Procurement Law of Mongolia of 1 December 2005, \neffective since 1 February 2006, as amended (Attachment 1 dated 6 February 2007), with the \nclarifications and modifications described in the following paragraphs required for compliance \nwith the provisions of the Procurement Guidelines. \n \n(i)  Applicable procurement procedure. Bidding shall be conducted in accordance \nwith  the  Open  Bidding  Procedure,  as  defined  in  Chapter  Two  of  the  Public \nProcurement Law of Mongolia subject to the provisions stated in paragraph ii (c) \nbelow. \n \n(ii)  Participation in bidding and preferences \n \n(a)  Government-owned enterprises in Mongolia shall be eligible to participate \nin bidding only if they can establish that they are legally and financially \nautonomous, operate under commercial law, and are not a dependent \nagency of the procuring entity, or the project executing agency (EA) or \nimplementing agency (IA). \n(b)  Prospective  bidders  shall  be  permitted  to  request  bidding  documents \neither in person or by mail upon submission of a written application. \nBidding documents shall be sold to anyone who is willing to pay the \nrequired fee for the bidding documents, and no other conditions shall be \nimposed on the sale of the bidding documents. The bidding documents \nshall be delivered, at the prospective bidders' preference, either by hand \nor by mail or courier, provided that the bidder is willing to pay the mail or \ncourier delivery charges, which should be specified in the bid invitation. \nEach bidder shall be allowed to purchase only one set of the bidding \ndocuments for a given tender. No limitations shall be imposed on any \nbidder as to the number of tenders in which it may participate during a \ngiven period of time, but the bidder\u2019s qualification (financial and technical \ncapabilities) for award of contract(s) shall be assessed on the basis of its \ncapacity to meet the aggregated qualifying requirements for the award of \ncontracts for which it has submitted the lowest evaluated substantially \nresponsive bids.  \n(c)  Interested  foreign  bidders  from  eligible  countries  shall  be  allowed  to \nparticipate without being required to associate or form joint ventures with \nlocal bidders. Foreign bidders shall be eligible to participate in bidding \nunder the same conditions as local bidders. Mongolian bidders and goods \nmanufactured  in  Mongolia  shall  be  given  no  preference  over  foreign \nbidders and goods manufactured outside Mongolia, either in the bidding \nprocess or in the evaluation of bids. \n(d)  Prior registration shall not be a requirement for any bidder to participate in \nbidding. \n(e)  Pre-qualification of contractors shall not be required, except in the case of \nlarge or complex works and with the prior written concurrence of ADB.  \n \n(iii)  Advertising.  Invitations  to  bid  shall be advertised in the Mongolian national \nlanguage in at least one widely circulated national daily newspaper and freely \naccessible, nationally-known website in accordance with Article 21.1 of the Public \n ", "                    Appendix 6  45 \nProcurement  Law  of  Mongolia.  Bidding  of  NCB  contracts  estimated  at  (a) \n$500,000 or more for Goods and related services, and (b) $1,000,000 or more for \nWorks shall be advertised concurrently with the general procurement notices on \nADB\u2019s website. \n \n(iv)  Standard  bidding  documents.  Standard  bidding  documents,  acceptable  to \nADB, shall be used. The bidding documents shall provide clear instructions on \nhow bids should be submitted, how prices should be offered, and the place and \ntime for submission and opening of bids. Bidders shall be allowed to submit bids \nby hand, by mail, or by courier. \n \n(v)  Qualification criteria and evaluation criteria \n \n(a)  Qualification criteria shall be clearly specified in the bidding documents, \nand all criteria so specified, shall be used to determine whether a bidder \nis  qualified.  The  evaluation  of  the  bidder\u2019s  qualifications  should  be \nconducted separately from the technical and commercial evaluation of the \nbid.  When  post  qualification  is  applied,  the  assessment  of  bidders' \nqualifications shall be carried out only after the preliminary and detailed \nevaluation of bids has been completed by the EA/IA and, in doing so, the \nqualifications  of  the  bidder  who  has  submitted  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially responsive bid shall be assessed first. The evaluation of a \nbidder\u2019s qualifications shall only take into account the bidder\u2019s capacity \nand resources to perform the contract, in particular its experience and \npast  performance  on  similar  contracts,  capabilities  with  respect  to \npersonnel, equipment, and construction or manufacturing facilities, and \nfinancial position. In carrying out the post-qualification assessment, the \nEA/IA shall exercise reasonable judgment in requesting, in writing, from a \nbidder only missing factual or historical supporting information related to \nthe bidder's qualifications and shall provide a reasonable time period (that \nis, a minimum of 7 days) to the bidder to provide his response.  \n(b)  Evaluation criteria to be used in the evaluation of bids shall be clearly \nspecified in the bidding documents, and evaluation criteria other than \nprice  shall  be  quantified  in  monetary  terms.  All  evaluation  criteria  so \nspecified, shall be taken into account in bid evaluation. Merit points shall \nnot be used in bid evaluation.  \n \n(vi)  Bid opening, evaluation, and award of contract \n \n(a)  Bids shall be opened in public, immediately upon the stipulated deadline \nfor  submission  of  bids.  Bidders'  representatives  and  the  Project's \nbeneficiaries from the concerned local community who choose to attend \nshall be allowed to attend. The name of the bidder and total amount of \neach bid, including discounts, shall be read aloud and recorded in the Bid \nOpening Record. Bids received after the deadline for bid submission shall \nbe  rejected  and  returned  to  the  bidders  unopened.  Immediately  after \ncompletion of the bid opening proceedings, a copy of the Bid Opening \nRecord shall be posted at a prominent location, accessible to the public, \noutside the office of the concerned procuring entity and shall be retained \nat the same location until the award of contract has been notified. A copy \n   ", "46  Appendix 6 \nof the Bid Opening Record shall be promptly provided to all bidders who \nsubmitted bids.      \n(b)  All bids shall not be rejected or new bids invited without ADB's prior \nwritten concurrence. \n(c)  No bid shall be rejected merely on the basis of a comparison with the \nowner\u2019s estimated cost or budget ceiling without the ADB's prior written \nconcurrence. \n(d)  A bid containing material deviations from or reservations to the terms, \nconditions or specifications of the bidding documents shall be rejected as \nnot substantially responsive. A bidder shall not be permitted to withdraw \nmaterial deviations or reservations once bids have been opened. Bidders \nshall not be eliminated from detailed evaluation on the basis of non-\nmaterial, minor deviations, or reservations. \n(e)  The evaluation of bids shall be done in strict adherence to the criteria \nspecified in the bidding documents, and contracts shall be awarded to the \nqualified bidder offering the lowest evaluated and substantially responsive \nbid. \n(f)  Bidders shall be requested to extend the validity of their bids only under \nexceptional circumstances and, in all such cases, the EA/IA shall obtain \nADB\u2019s approval for the extension of the bid validity period in a timely \nmanner, and subsequently, communicate such request for extension of \nthe validity period of the bids in writing to all bidders before the date of \nexpiry of their bids. Bidders shall have the right to refuse to grant such an \nextension of the validity of their bids without forfeiting their bid securities. \nBidders agreeing to extend the validity date of their bids shall also extend \nthe validity period of their bid securities. \n(g)  In the case of contracts of more than 18 months\u2019 duration, the bidding \ndocuments and the resultant contract shall provide for price adjustment, \nbased on a formula acceptable to ADB, which shall be disclosed to the \nbidders in the bidding documents. \n(h)  If a bidder that submitted the lowest evaluated bid refuses to accept the \narithmetical corrections made by the EA/IA during the evaluation of its \nbid, its bid shall be disqualified and its bid security shall be forfeited. \n(i)  A bidder shall not be required, as a condition for award, to undertake \nobligations not specified in the bidding documents or otherwise to modify \nits bid as originally submitted. \n(j)  There shall be no post-bidding negotiations with the lowest evaluated \nbidder or any other bidder. No bidder shall be required, as a condition for \nthe award of contract, to change his bid price or otherwise materially alter \nhis bid after it has been submitted. \n(k)  A bidder declared ineligible by ADB, based on a determination by ADB \nthat the bidder has engaged in corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices in competing for or in executing an ADB-financed contract, shall \nbe ineligible to be awarded an ADB-financed contract during the period of \ntime determined by ADB. \n \n(vii)  Inspections of accounts and records.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the National Country Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership \n \nMongolia\u2019s National Development Strategy 2008 states that one of the key priorities of the Government is improving the \nquality of and access to basic education and health services. This will support employment and income-generating \nactivities and supporting sustainable human development. In implementing these activities, the Government will ensure \nthat the poor and other vulnerable groups have equal access to basic social services, supporting their opportunities for \nemployment and participation in economic activities. The objective will be for each person to reach satisfactory levels of \neducation, food availability, and health.1  \n \nThe Project was designed to closely reflect national priorities defined in the National Development Strategy. In \nparticular, the Project will: \n \n(i)   contribute to an improvement in the quality of, and access to education at all levels by (a) reducing the \nannual costs of education to parents, currently estimated to be equivalent to 50%\u201370% of the monthly \nminimum subsistence level set by the National Statistical Office; (b) improving the targeting of free textbook \nsupport to the poorest; (c) improving access to information, skills, and training in poor rural areas by \ndeveloping information and communication technology (ICT)-based education services pioneered by the \nICT for Innovating Rural Education in Mongolia (IIREM) project; (d) improving the efficiency and use of ICT \nin primary and secondary schools through support for the development of a national strategy for ICT in \nbasic education; (e) providing technical assistance (TA) to rationalize the existing education planning, \nmanagement, implementation, and monitoring systems at the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science \n(MECS) in order to improve the provision of funding to aimags and schools and thus to improve educational \nefficiency and quality; (f) improving pre-service teacher training (higher education) in an effort to improve \nquality inputs into the basic education subsector; and (g) improving the teaching and learning environment \nthrough rehabilitation and upgrading of teacher training institute facilities; \n(ii)   contribute to education sector development by (a) providing technical assistance, training, and support in \nplanning, management, implementation, technical, and professional issues, including the coordination, \nsynchronization, and upgrading of existing management information systems to MECS and Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) staff, including aimag education staff, who will be supported to strengthen their capacity to \nplan, manage, administer, and regulate the system; (b) supporting activities to improve pre-service teacher \ntraining, which will directly and indirectly enhance the quality of professional staff, teacher training courses, \nand assessment of teacher trainees, and will attract a higher quality of applicants and ensure that a higher \nproportion of graduates continue into the teaching profession; (c) addressing textbook provision and ICT \ninvestment  and  usage,  both  of  which  are  closely  associated  with  quality  and  student  performance. \n(textbooks represent the biggest single cost that parents incur in sending their children to school and a  \nnational ICT strategy for education will ensure optimum usage and impact of existing and future investments \nin ICT); and (d) improving efficiency through investments in new and rehabilitated facilities such as \nclassrooms, dormitories, libraries, learning equipment, textbooks, and instructional materials. \n(iii)   contribute to poverty reduction by increasing access to better basic education services, particularly in rural \nand peri-urban areas, and by improving opportunities for increased financial earnings.  \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis                                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-  \n                                                                                                                        non-income Millennium Development Goals \n1.   Key Issues \nThe World Bank Mongolia Poverty Assessment (2006) found that \u201ca composite profile of a poor Mongolian is a person \nwho lives in rural areas, has many children, works with livestock and has a lower secondary or lesser standard of \neducation.\u201d There are important differences in per capita gross domestic product and poverty incidence between \nUlaanbaatar and the rest of the country: Ulaanbaatar has the highest per capita income and lowest poverty rate and \nrural areas have the lowest per capita income and highest poverty rate. Poverty incidence in rural areas is higher than \nin urban areas (43% versus 30% in urban areas in 2002 and 37.9% against 27.9% in 2006). The lowest poverty levels \n   ", "50  Appendix 8 \nare in Ulaanbaatar (about 27% in 2006), where half of the population lives. The highest levels (51% in 2006) are in the \nWestern Region. Until 1998, poverty was more significant in urban than in rural areas (in 1998, 39.4% of urban \nresidents and 32.6% of rural residents were below the poverty threshold) but from 2002 that situation has been \nreversed. From 1998 to 2006 urban poverty levels have declined from 39.4% to 27.9%, but over the same period rural \npoverty has worsened from 32.6% to 37.9%. The differential poverty gap between urban and rural areas has \ndeteriorated by 15.4% to the detriment of rural areas between 1995 and 2006. Between 2002 and 2007 the national \npoverty thresholds calculated by the National Statistical Office increased by over 300%, although the combined \nconsumer price index and dollar exchange rates decreased the value of the MNT by only 180% over the same period. \nIt is significant that the poverty thresholds have been increased far more in rural areas than in urban areas. Thus, the \npoverty threshold in Ulaanbaatar increased by only 297% between 2002 and 2007 whereas the poverty thresholds in \nCentral, Khangai, and Western Regions have been increased by approximately 370%. This is a clear indication that it \nis becoming more expensive to live in rural areas. In 2007 there was an 11% differential between the poverty \nthresholds for Ulaanbaatar and the Eastern Region. The National Statistical Office poverty threshold is based on an \nestimate of the income necessary to purchase a 2,100 kilocalorie diet, with adjustments for essential non-food \nexpenditures.  \n \nThe World Bank analysis of the Living Standards Measurement Survey of 1998 and 2002 found that the negative \nimpact of poverty on school dropout rates is significant at every level of schooling\u2014even at primary level where \ncompletion rates are normally close to universal\u2014and poverty has the largest effect on upper secondary dropouts. \nPoverty affects children\u2019s educational outcomes directly (out-of-pocket and opportunity costs) and indirectly (family or \nparental background). Educational quality (measured by 2006, 2007 basic education examination results conducted by \nthe Education Evaluation Center) is significantly lower in rural areas. One of the major causes of high dropout rates, \nwhich is of specific significance to the poor, is the high parental cost of education. A 100-school survey conducted by \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) indicates that the national average annual cost of sending a child to \nschool varies from MNT83,000 in grade 1 to MNT115,000 in grade 8. However, there are significant regional variations \nand education costs to parents are generally higher (up to MNT150,000) and the quality of education lower in rural \nareas than in Ulaanbaatar. The regional average monthly poverty threshold income was established at MNT54,500 in \n2007 so that the parental costs of education can represent between 1.5 and 2 times the monthly income for a person \non the poverty threshold. Textbooks represent the highest single cost followed by travel to school, school uniforms, and \nstationery. Textbook availability is rated as the most important indicator of student performance by parents and \nteachers and a reduction in the cost of textbooks to parents will have an impact on access to education for the poor.  \nAlmost 30% of schools surveyed indicated that they did not receive the free textbook allocation for poor and vulnerable \nchildren and most schools indicated that in any case it was insufficient to meet needs and poorly administered. \nImproving the targeting of the free textbook allocation and the efficiency of the Government\u2019s flagship social assistance \nprogram, the Child Money Program, will have a significant impact on the affordability of education to the poor, \nparticularly in rural areas. Starting from 2006, the Child Money Program has provided MNT3,000 per month and \nMNT25,000 per quarter to all children aged 0\u201318 regardless of household income. Early findings of the ADB-funded \nParticipatory Poverty Assessment and Monitoring Project indicate that the these payments are an important source of \nincome for very poor families, although the informal charges levied by many schools and the overall parental costs of \neducation (see above) are too high for the poor, even with Child Money Program support. Migration from rural to peri-\nurban areas has grown as migrants seek better education, health, and other services, and income-generating \nopportunities. This has caused overcrowding in urban schools. High migration rates can also be associated with poor \nstudent performance in soum and bagh schools, and the indirect cost of schooling in relation to household per capita \nexpenditure increases significantly above grade 8. As a result, poorer families are under-represented in upper \nsecondary education in both rural and urban areas. In effect, poverty is an important factor in determining whether a \nchild is enrolled in school and also whether a child can progress to senior secondary and higher education. Yet, without \nunhampered access to quality education, opportunities for earning a reasonable income and rising above the poverty \nline are restricted; graduates of at least secondary education are significantly less likely to be poor. \n2.   Design Features \nWhile the Project aims to improve education sector efficiency as a whole, there will be an emphasis on strengthening \ninstitutional capacity in education sector planning, management, implementation, monitoring, and resource allocation. \nAs far as poor and disadvantaged families and/or areas are concerned, the intended and expected results will ensure \nlower  costs  for  parents,  better  targeting  of  pro-poor  subsidies,  more  inclusiveness,  transparency,  and  efficient \nmonitoring, which will improve access, relevance, quality, and equity in education. The Project will establish rural pilot \nschools to continue the educational initiatives of ICT pioneered in the IIREM project and to pilot teacher upgrading \nthrough distance education. These pilot schools will also be benefit from the management information system and \nbudgeting initiatives resulting from the finance system components. The project design has taken into account the \nfollowing factors that hinder basic education enrollment and attainment levels in disadvantaged areas: (i) high levels of \npoverty; (ii) high costs for parents in sending children to school, a particular issue for poor families and families in ger \nsettlements in urban areas; (iii) poor targeting of educational subsidies for the poor; (iv) distant location of the school; \n(v) lack of effective use of ICT investments; and (vi) lack of qualified teachers in some rural areas. \n ", "Appendix 8    51\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \n       Not applicable. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nAs far as targeted beneficiaries are concerned, social problems related to education are largely a rural phenomenon, \nalthough overcrowding in urban areas resulting from inward migration from rural areas is a growing problem and \ndropout rates and failures to enroll are increasing in ger areas around cities.  First, children tend to be left out of upper \nsecondary schooling because of a combination of lack of access, poor educational quality, and limited household \naffordability. Despite general progress in school attendance over the past 5 years, rural students are still at a \ndisadvantage. In particular, rural students in bagh and soum do not have equal access to upper secondary education \nbecause rural schools closed senior secondary grades during the reorganization and rationalization reform in 1997, \nwhile provincial center schools have only limited spaces. Attrition rates are significantly higher among rural children, \nand educational quality, measured by exam results, is significantly worse in rural schools. Poverty directly, through out-\nof-pocket and opportunity costs, and indirectly, through parental background, contributes to dropout rates. Rural \nstudents who tend to perform worse and drop out after the 8th grade are highly likely to be poor. High dropout rates are \na concern because of their long-term implications for inter-generational transmission of poverty. Second, there are \nshortcomings in implementing systems of teachers' incentives, resource allocation, and public assistance to rural \nschools. An assessment of the outcomes from the rationalization and reorganization reform indicated that the reform \neffort seems to have perpetuated the widening gaps in educational outcomes between urban (aimag center and capital \ncity) and rural (soum) schools. Third, the tendency to migrate from rural areas to aimag centers and eventually to \nUlaanbaatar has been very strong. According to findings of the survey Children on the Move: Rural-urban Migration \nand Access to Education in Mongolia, the major reasons for households to move were to find jobs (34.3%), to give \nchildren better education (31.2% overall but the most important reason among women), and to get closer to services \nand information (20.6%). During the last 10 years, 30% of migrants coming to Ulaanbaatar have been school-age \nchildren. As a result of this additional burden, some urban schools have to organize classes in three shifts with up to 60 \npupils per class. School-age migrant children are more than three times more likely to be out of school than children of \nlong-term residents. A third of migrant children have dropped out of their schools mainly because of registration \nproblems, discrimination at school, and family poverty. This situation not only contradicts the expectations of many \nmigrants, who came to the city to get their children a better education, but also negatively affects the quality of \neducation in areas of both origin and destination. If the trend continues, it will create serious burdens on the capital \ncity\u2019s  schooling,  housing,  infrastructure,  environment,  and  social  services.  If  the  impacts  of  migration  are  not \nconsidered more systematically, national goals for access to education will probably not be achieved. \n \nMore access to high-quality and relevant basic education for rural students is a priority for equitable and sustainable \ndevelopment in Mongolia. Therefore the Project will assist the Government (both directly and indirectly) in addressing \noptions to improve access for rural children, including (i) reducing costs for parents, (ii) improving targeting of \neducational subsidies, (iii) increasing the efficiency of planning and budgeting, (iv) improving the availability and usage \nof key quality inputs into the education system, (v) focusing on improved quality in rural schools, and (vi) improving the \nefficiency and quality of pre-service teacher education.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nThe assessment and consultation were done jointly with the Government to ensure participation by all relevant \nstakeholders. All the executing agencies (EAs) and other stakeholders were consulted. The Project was designed in a \nparticipatory process involving major government and nongovernment stakeholders at national and provincial levels, \nschool  directors  and  teachers,  community  leaders,  and  development  partners  through  regular  consultations, \nworkshops, and presentations. During the project preparatory TA, interviews were conducted with all of the above, plus \nall development partners and foreign and local NGOs actively involved in the education sector. Field visits were made \nto schools and education departments in seven aimags in addition to school visits in urban and peri-urban areas of \nUlaanbaatar. Focus group discussions with teachers and parents were organized in five aimags and a comprehensive \nschool survey was administered in 100 schools in five aimags (over 13% of the total number of Mongolia schools) \nbased on a preliminary test survey organized in 20 schools in two other aimags. A total of 18 schools were visited by \nproject preparatory TA consultants and were studied in detail through visits to dormitories, classrooms, libraries, \ncomputer labs, kitchens, washing and toilet facilities, and sports halls. Written submissions were invited from higher \neducation and teacher training institutes and a survey of selected higher education institutions was also undertaken.  \n \nDuring implementation, the Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation in all of its activities. It will encourage \n(i) nationwide consultation in the rationalization of the  planning, management, implementation, monitoring,  and \nresource allocation in the education sector; (ii) partnership between education and training institutions and industry in \n   ", "52  Appendix 8 \ndeveloping and delivering market-oriented training curricula and programs; (iii) greater parental involvement in school \nmanagement; (iv) active consultation and participation of parents in the design of low-cost textbook rental schemes and \nrevolving funds; and (v) greater school and parental involvement in administration and decision-making on subsidy \nschemes for the poor. \n \n2.

They agreed to ensure participation by relevant stakeholders by following a participatory approach during \nproject implementation, especially in the implementation, operation and maintenance of improved facilities, and civil \nworks. The project steering committee set up under the Second and Third Education Development Projects will be \nused to provide policy guidance for this Project to coordinate consultation and participation, and to ensure consistency, \nharmonization, and continuity of activities in the context of the sector-wide approach.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. According to the ADB/World Bank Mongolia country gender assessment (2005), more girls than boys \nare enrolled in school in every aimag, including Ulaanbaatar city. This pattern emerged in the immediate post-transition \nperiod, although the gap has narrowed in recent years. Dropout rates for boys at secondary level are high among poor \nfamilies in urban areas, while in rural areas, children drop out even at primary level. The gender gap is particularly \nnoticeable at higher levels of education: women constituted 80% of students who had completed secondary education \nin a survey conducted by the United Nations Development Fund for Women-Economic Growth Support and Poverty \nReduction Strategy.   \n2.

The gender action plan is designed to level gender imbalances in education, particularly \nat secondary level and higher. It aims to (i) encourage more men to work as basic education \nteachers, broadening the role model available for children, taking into account the poorer school \nattendance and higher dropout rates for boys than for girls in Mongolia; (ii) develop strategies to \naddress  gender  stereotyping  in  curriculum  and  textbook  development;  (iii)  reduce  gender \ndisparities by making textbooks cheaper and encouraging good teachers to teach in rural areas; \nand (iv) assist in reducing the dropout rates of boys in rural areas by targeting dormitory \nsubsidies at poor rural households.  \n \nTable A9: Gender Action Plan \nProject Component  Tasks \nOutput 1: Strengthening planning,  \u2022  Ensure use of gender-disaggregated data and \nbudgeting, and management of  make sure gender issues are addressed in \neducation  primary and secondary education through \n\u2022  Strengthening information  synchronized education management information \nsystems  systems \n\u2022  Improving planning and school- \u2022  Include gender, poverty, and indigenous \nbased financial strategies   considerations in funding criteria  \n\u2022  Ensuring adequate school- \u2022  Ensure that male and female staff of Ministry of \nbased operational budgets that  Education, Culture, and Science (MECS), district \nare sufficient to ensure the  education administrations, and schools have equal \neffective delivery of curriculum  opportunities to participate in capacity building \nobjectives and outcomes   training \n  \u2022  Develop MECS staff capacity to identify barriers to \nboys\u2019 participation in education \n\u2022  Create conditions in schools to encourage the \nemployment of more men in teaching positions  \n\u2022  Prepare inclusive social development plans that \nincorporate an analysis of gender issues and \nplans to address them \n\u2022  Study potential policies for targeting dormitory \nsubsidies and cash transfers at poor rural \nhouseholds, and, in particular, for boys  \n\u2022  Ensure baseline surveys consider gender specific \nquestions \n \nOutput  2:  Enhancing  quality  and  \u2022  Include components in the pre-service teacher \nrelevance  of  pre-service  teacher  training curricula, to help teachers identify and \ntraining  overcome barriers to boys\u2019 participation in school \n\u2022  Reforming the curricula of  \u2022  Develop all teacher training curricula, materials, \nteacher training institutes (TTIs)  and courses from a gender perspective \n\u2022  Developing implementing a  \u2022  Ensure that selection criteria for TTIs include a \ncomprehensive quality  focus on gender equity and the encouragement of \nassurance system in TTIs  men as student teachers in TTIs \n\u2022  Improving continuous  \u2022  Deliver gender-sensitive teaching to all student \nprofessional development for  teachers in TTIs \nteacher educators  \u2022  Ensure training in gender-sensitive teaching is \n ", "Appendix 9    55\nProject Component  Tasks \n\u2022  Reforming teaching practice  provided to all teacher educators \npolicy and implementation  \u2022  Promote men\u2019s participation in the teaching \nstrategy  workforce \n\u2022  Improving teaching and  \u2022  Ensure provision of scholarships for teacher \nlearning resources provision  training for rural teachers \n \nOutput  3:  Better  affordability,  \u2022  Develop gender-neutral textbooks and \nquality,  availability,  and  effective  supplementary materials (i.e., avoid  gender \nusage  of  teaching  and  learning  stereotyping)  \nmaterials  \u2022  Develop gender-appropriate information and \n\u2022  Creating a textbook rental  communication technology (ICT) applications, \nscheme and revolving fund for  software, and learning objects \nprimary schools  \u2022  Ensure that free textbooks for poor and vulnerable \n\u2022  Improving content, teaching,  families reach boys, girls, and members of ethnic \nand information access to poor  minorities \nschools in rural areas  \u2022  Translate textbooks into the Kazakh language  \n\u2022  Developing a midterm national \nICT strategy \n \nOutput 4: Upgrading facilities in  \u2022  Ensure that the selection of schools for the ICT \nTTIs   subcomponent includes schools in aimags with a \nhigh concentration of ethnic minorities, e.g., \nBayan-Olgiy \n\u2022  In evaluating bidding proposals for rehabilitation of \nschools and school facilities, ensure preference is \ngiven to construction companies owned or \noperated by ethnic minorities \n \nProgram Management  \u2022  Create gender sensitivity among all stakeholders \n\u2022  Ensure gender disaggregated data, analysis and \nreporting on all project activities and components  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   ", "56  Appendix 10 \n                   \nLESSONS LEARNED \nLessons  Incorporating Lessons in Project Design \n1.  Need for close coordination   \nof external assistance  Although the Education Donors\u2019 Consultative Mechanism \n  is viewed as a model mechanism for donor coordination \nin  other  sectors  in  Mongolia,  at  present,  the  level  of \nharmonization of donor activities in the education sector \nis  relatively  low,  with  parallel  funding  by  various \ndevelopment partners.

Cost Reduction \n \n1.  Production. Textbooks are currently produced using expensive four-color printing but \ninadequate binding. The use of four-color printing for textbooks that are expected to last for only \n1 year is wastage of scarce resources and an additional cost to parents. Consideration should \nbe given to using four-color printing on one side of the printed sheet but one-color printing on \nthe reverse side, which would probably reduce printing costs by around 20\u201325%. However, this \nrequires editorial and design skill to make sure that all the color work is correctly positioned. \n \n2.  Distribution and Durability. Publishers confirm that textbooks that are not bought by \nparents represent a considerable waste, which has to be built into textbook costs. Pre-ordering \nsystems would reduce wastage but maintain competition and school-based choice. It would \nreduce textbook costs, although the biggest textbook cost reduction possibilities would come \nfrom extending book life.   \n  \nB.  Parent Purchase and Textbook Rental System and/or Revolving Funds \n \n3.  A  considerable  body  of  international  evidence  demonstrates  that  durable  textbooks \nenable the longest reasonable textbook life consistent with the need to provide regular revision, \nreview, and updating. A target book life of 4 to 5 years was regularly achieved during the central \nplanning period and is also a reasonable period for review and updating of both curriculum \nrequirements and textbook content. A long book life combined with an efficient textbook rental \nsystem is the most cost-effective system. \n \n4.  If parental contributions are to remain the main source of textbook financing, there are \ntwo basic approaches. These are (i) parental purchase of textbooks, and (ii) parental payment \nof rental fees for books, which are loaned to the student from the school textbook library. \nParental purchase, which implies ownership of textbooks, has three fundamental problems:  \n(i) it is not equitable, since rich parents can buy more new textbooks than poor parents; (ii) \nschools find it difficult to manage the optimum usage of incomplete textbook supplies, since \nparents who have purchased textbooks may object to a textbook being borrowed or used by a \nstudent who has not; and (iii) it is usually more difficult for parents to afford than rental systems.  \n \n5.  In a rental system, textbooks are owned by the school, so poor and rich students benefit \nequally. School ownership also allows the equitable distribution of available books if there is \nless than 100% provision. Under a rental system, parents who can afford to may also buy their \nown copies of textbooks for use at home. Perhaps the most important advantage of a rental \nsystem over a purchase system is that the full costs of provision do not necessarily have to be \npaid in advance by the parent. They can be spread over a 4- or 5-year period and can even be \npaid on a quarterly basis. This significantly reduces the periodic investments that parents make \nin textbooks and makes it possible even for poor parents to support the scheme. Focus group \ndiscussions with teachers made it very clear that a most parents find it very hard too afford to \nbuy all the textbooks at one time at the beginning of the school year. They would strongly \nwelcome a system that reduced the size of their financial outlay, and allowed costs to be spread \nover several quarters rather than paid all at once every September.  \n ", "Appendix 11    59\n \nC.  Setting-up a Textbook Rental Scheme and Revolving Fund \n \n6.  A textbook rental scheme is a method of providing textbook sets on loan to students in \nreturn for an annual rental fee. Rental fees paid by parents are held and accumulated in a \ntextbook revolving fund which is used to purchase replacement copies when textbooks reach \nthe end of their targeted useful classroom life. The fund \u201crevolves\u201d because expenditures on \nreplacement copies are replaced by continued rental fee contributions from parents. The rental \nfee income has to be calculated and managed to ensure that there is sufficient funding to \nguarantee full replacement supplies. Textbook rental schemes and revolving funds work best if \nworking capital can be made available to supply all textbook requirements free of charge to \nschools on a staggered basis over a period of 4-5 years. In this scenario the Government and/or \nfunding agencies would fund the initial supplies to schools. The accumulated rental fees would \nfund replacement costs and would provide the basis of a sustainable, parent-funded system. \nThis is the textbook revolving fund. \n \n7.  Textbook  rental  fees  are  normally  held  in  dedicated  interest-bearing  school  bank \naccounts  controlled  by  elected  management  committees  of  parents  and  staff.  This  means \nparents can see that the funds are used entirely for the benefit of the children in their own \ncommunity. Bank statements should be posted on school notice boards to demonstrate that the \nfunds have not been diverted. If the national textbook provision system operates on the basis of \na 4-year book life, funds should ideally be accumulated without expenditure over 4 years. At the \nend of this period, the funds can be used to purchase replacement copies for textbooks that are \nworn out, or need to be replaced by new approved editions.  \n \n8.  The Government\u2019s current policy of free textbook allocations to 20% of the students is \ninsufficient given the national poverty level of 32%, is not well targeted, and is reported to be \nadministered  inefficiently.  If  the  Government  wishes  to  continue  to  provide  support  to  the \npoorest through a rental system it can remit cash payments directly into these school textbook \nbank  accounts,  enabling  schools  to  offer  the  poorest  students  free  books  of  lower  rental \ncharges. Transferring cash directly into school textbook bank accounts is more efficient and \ncheaper than physically transferring books. It also prevents the diversion of free textbooks away \nfrom schools at the aimag level and ensures that the free textbooks are those selected by the \nschools, which is not the case at the moment. In order to ensure the proper and efficient \nmanagement  of  the  system,  it  is  normal  to  establish  a  national  trust  or  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to manage the system (this is what is done in Armenia and Uzbekistan). \nEvery school textbook fund would be a voting member of the trust or NGO and would be \nrequired to operate according to the rules and regulations it establishes. Legal charters and \noperational  rules  and  regulations  that  exist  in  other  countries  can  be  adapted  for  use  in \nMongolia. Every school in the aimag would vote to appoint an aimag representative on the trust \nor NGO board, which would comprise senior representatives of the Ministry of Education, \nCulture, and Science (MECS), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the aimag representatives. \nThere would also be a small group of permanent trust or NGO management staff funded from \nan agreed percentage of the interest earned on accumulated rental fees in each school account. \nThis would be automatically transferred to the trust or NGO every year. \n \n9.  The  charter,  rules, and  regulations  would  prevent  any  transfer  of  funds  away  from \nschools (with the exception of the transfers noted above). They would prevent the use of funds \nfor any purpose other than the procurement of textbooks. All decision-making would be made by \nthe school textbook fund committees. The charter would guarantee that the collected rental fees \nbelong to the schools and not to the MECS or MOF. Each school bank account would normally \n   ", "60  Appendix 11 \n                   \nbe  established  on  a  \u201cdeposit  only\u201d  basis  for  the  initial  4  years  to  guarantee  that  funds \naccumulate. All school bank account details would automatically be copied to the trust or NGO \n(for information only, not for withdrawals) and simple software programs would enable school \naccounts to be monitored so problem schools (e.g., those with unacceptably low rental fee \ncollection rates) would be identified early and helped by the local aimag inspectorate.  \n \n10.  Textbook  rental  fees  should  be  calculated  annually  by  the  trust  or  NGO  and \ncommunicated to schools and parents. Simple and cheap aimag-based computerized ordering \nsystems  would  enable  schools  to  place  their  order  requirements  early  each  year  using \nelectronic order forms and price lists prepared by the trust or NGO operating on behalf of \nMECS. The orders would be stored electronically at the aimag level and consolidated by the \ntrust or NGO. This means publishers can be provided with accurate print runs and lists of \nschools to which they should deliver books direct. This avoids waste and publishers\u2019 risk and \nwill ultimately reduce costs. It also means that schools have books delivered direct and that \nparents are spared the cost of traveling to aimag centers to buy books.  \n \n11.  The  system  of  textbook  loans  from  school  textbook  stores  to  students  operated \nsuccessfully in Mongolia for many years. The concept is therefore very familiar. What is needed \nto move to a rental fee and revolving fund system is the addition of rental fee collections, the \nopening  and  management  of  textbook  fund  bank  accounts,  and  the  establishment  of  the \nmanaging trust or NGO. The development of a rental fee and revolving fund system is not \nunduly  complex,  although  considerable  careful  preparation  is  required.  Assurances  will  be \nrequired from the Government to establish the trust or NGO as the management authority for \nthe pilot textbook rental scheme and textbook revolving fund. All Mongolian schools already \noperate their own bank accounts, so there will be no problem in opening an additional dedicated \ntextbook rental scheme and revolving funds account. Existing NGO legislation in Mongolia can \nbe used to establish a textbook rental scheme and revolving funds trust and new legislation is in \npreparation that is aimed solely at enabling the operation of charitable trusts. \n \nD.  Competing Textbooks \n \n12.  MECS policy supports the development of competing textbooks. An effective textbook \nrental  scheme  will  provide  a  predictable  textbook  market,  which  will  support  the  rapid \ndevelopment of private sector publishing and printing. Armenia, for example, with a population \nalmost identical to that of Mongolia, has competing alternative textbooks for each subject and \ngrade level. The MECS would be responsible for selecting a list of textbooks from competitive \nsubmissions  by  publishers  against  defined  content  and  methodological  requirements. \nEvaluation and selection will be transparent and according to established criteria. Individual \nschools may then choose whichever title they wish from the list of approved textbooks. Genuine \nand  significant  improvement  in  textbook  content,  design,  and  teaching  approach  will  only \ndevelop when there is creative competition between publishers.
