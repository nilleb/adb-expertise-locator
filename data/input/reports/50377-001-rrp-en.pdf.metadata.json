The program is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priorities of strengthening \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity;  improving the  access, quality,  and  reliability  of  services; \nand building climate resilience.5 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nTuvalu is a fragile microstate comprising nine low-lying atolls covering a land area of 26 \nsquare kilometers. More than half the population of 11,100 (2017) resides in Funafuti\u2014an area \nof only 2.8 square kilometers. Tuvalu\u2019s remoteness from major markets, dependence on imports, \nand vulnerability to external shocks and climate change pose significant risks to socioeconomic \ndevelopment. Tuvalu has a narrow economic base, and domestic revenues are highly reliant on \nvolatile external revenue sources, including fishing license fees and \u201c.tv\u201d internet domain license \nfees. External grants from development partners  are a critical source of budget financing. The \npublic sector accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP) and provides most of the \nformal sector employment. The private sector is small and struggles to grow because of the lack \nof economies of scale and high transaction costs. Given the dominance of the public sector, sound \nfinancial management is critical to ensure the effective delivery of public services and investments \nthat underpin economic growth.  \n \nRecent  macroeconomic  performance. 6  Growth  in  Tuvalu  accelerated  to  4.9%  per \n4. \nannum during 2015\u20132018 from 0.8% per annum during 2011\u20132014, driven by higher government \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The program is in ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business \nPlan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2019\u20132021. Manila. It aligns with ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. \nManila. The concept paper for the program was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 3 September 2019. \n2  The  Policy  Matrix,  containing  a  prioritized  list  of  reforms  implemented  between  July  2018  and  June  2019,  is  in \n\nAppendix 4. \n\n3  ADB. 2012.

Fishing license revenues \nincreased  by  84.8%  in  2018  with  the  receipt  of  a  one-off  payment  from  a  subregional  pooling \nscheme. Tuvalu recorded fiscal surpluses of 13.5% of GDP in 2017 and 33.9% of GDP in 2018. \nHigher public sector wages and infrastructure projects are expected to accelerate inflation for both \n2019 and 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated external public debt at 28.0% \nof GDP in 2018, and continues to classify Tuvalu as being at high risk of debt distress primarily \nbecause of its vulnerability to external shocks.7 \n \nThe  Tuvalu  Trust  Fund  (TTF)  was  created  in  1987  to  help  smooth  revenue  volatility.8 \n5. \nDistributions are made from the TTF to its associated buffer fund\u2014the Consolidated Investment \nFund  (CIF)\u2014when  the  TTF\u2019s  balance  exceeds  its  maintained  value.  Under  the  current  fiscal \npolicy, a minimum balance of 16% from the TTF maintained value is required to be maintained in \nthe CIF to provide a buffer for budget expenditure. In 2015, the government established the Tuvalu \nSurvival Fund for disaster relief and rehabilitation. As of 30 March 2019, the market value of TTF \ninvestments was $122.3 million, while the maintained value was $123.7\u202fmillion. As of 30 March \n2019,  the  CIF  balance  was  $22.8  million  (18%  of  the  TTF  maintained  value),  and  the  Tuvalu \nSurvival  Fund  was $6.2  million.  The government  also holds contingent  disaster financing from \nADB,  approved  in 2017  and valued at  $3.0  million.9 These funds provide  the government  with \nflexible  buffers  to  address  short-term  financing  gaps  and  the  scaling  up  of  reserve  assets\u2014\nincreasing the country\u2019s resilience to shocks. \n \n6. \nMacroeconomic and fiscal management risks. Growth is projected to remain strong, \nabove  4.0% from  2019 to 2021,  driven  by  higher  government  spending  on large infrastructure \nprojects  and  housing  for  Tuvalu\u2019s  hosting  of  major  events  such  as  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum \nLeaders  Meeting  held  in  August  2019.  Despite  the  positive  medium-term  outlook,  Tuvalu  is \nexposed  to  substantial  downside  risks  (particularly  the  link  between  the  global  economic \nenvironment  and  remittances,  TTF  returns,  and  volatile  fisheries  receipts)  that  challenge \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal management and macroeconomic sustainability. Fishing license revenues in \n2019  are  projected  to  decrease  to  $23.5  million\u2014about  the  same  level  as  in  2016  and  about \n65.7%  lower  than  revenue  receipts  in  2018.  This,  plus  higher  infrastructure  spending  for  the \nregional summit meeting, is expected to result in a budget deficit for 2019.10 Excluding grants, the \ndomestic fiscal deficit in 2019 is estimated to be $22.5 million (47.9% of GDP) (Table 1).11 \n \n7. \nThe  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative  (PCRAFI)  estimates \nthat, on average, Tuvalu should expect annualized disaster-related losses and damages of 2% of \nGDP.12 While the government is implementing activities to improve resilience to shocks, the costs \nassociated  with  physical  adaptation,  disaster  risk  reduction,  and  disaster  response  are  large \n\n                                                \n7  IMF.

A probabilistic catastrophe risk assessment conducted \nby  PCRAFI  in  2010  estimated  the  replacement cost  of  exposed assets  in  Tuvalu,  including  buildings  (public and \nprivate), as well as infrastructure (ports, airports, roads, and bridges), at $268 million (about 85% represents buildings \nand 14% represents infrastructure). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\frelative  to  the  size  of  the  economy  and  may  necessitate  higher  development  assistance  than \nwould  otherwise  be  required. 13 IMF\u2019s  2018  Article  IV  assessment  calls  for  a  stronger  fiscal \nframework  by  building  fiscal  buffers  and  a  further  improvement  in  climate  change  risk \nmanagement. \n\n \nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, 2016\u20132021 \n(% of GDP unless otherwise indicated) \n\nItem \nTotal revenue and grants  \nTotal revenue  \nOf which: tax revenue  \nGrants  \nTotal expenditure \nCurrent expenditure  \nOf which: Wages and salaries \nCapital expenditure \nOverall balance (including grants) \nin $ million \nOverall balance (excluding grants) \nin $ million \nGDP ($ million, current prices) \n\n2016 \n176.5  \n145.1  \n15.1  \n31.4  \n155.9  \n116.5  \n37.2  \n39.4  \n20.6  \n7.8  \n(10.8) \n(4.1) \n37.7  \n\n2017 \n142.4  \n117.9  \n14.7  \n24.5  \n128.9  \n97.9  \n35.8  \n30.9  \n13.5  \n5.5  \n(10.9) \n(4.5) \n40.8  \n\n2018e \n138.3  \n117.5  \n12.3  \n20.8  \n104.4  \n73.7  \n32.2  \n30.7  \n33.9  \n14.9  \n13.2  \n5.8  \n43.8  \n\n2019p \n138.0  \n91.3  \n14.1  \n46.7  \n139.2  \n95.7  \n39.4  \n43.4  \n(1.1) \n(0.5) \n(47.9) \n(22.5) \n46.9  \n\n2020p \n109.5  \n86.1  \n13.3  \n23.5  \n107.7  \n89.5  \n37.0  \n18.2  \n1.8  \n0.9  \n(21.7) \n(11.0) \n50.8  \n\n2021p \n116.0  \n81.7  \n12.6  \n34.4  \n101.3  \n84.7  \n35.0  \n16.6  \n14.7  \n8.0  \n(19.7) \n(10.7) \n54.6  \n\n( ) = negative, e = estimates, GDP = Gross Domestic Product, p = projection \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Tuvalu estimates. \n \n8. \nOngoing  public  financial  management  weaknesses.  Tuvalu\u2019s  public \nfinancial \nmanagement (PFM) has improved through the implementation of the PFM Roadmap, 2015\u20132018, \nwhich has helped improve functions of the Treasury Department to better account for funds and \nsupport  public  spending. 14  However,  there  are  still  areas  to  improve  in  fiscal  management, \nincluding  complying  with  public  procurement  regulations  and  accounting  procedures,  and \nmanaging infrastructure investments. Hence, the government updated the PFM Roadmap, 2018\u2013\n2021 to guide the efforts of the government and development partners to address the remaining \nweaknesses  in  fiscal  management  and  enhance  the  coordination  and  implementation  of  PFM \nreforms. Further, the limitation of the fiscal management framework concerns the credibility of the \naccounting and reporting system partly because of discrepancies associated with using both cash \naccounting and partial accrual accounting. The government has also identified public procurement \nas a priority area of PFM following initial reforms introduced in 2012.15 \n \nChallenges to infrastructure management. Infrastructure development is an important \n9. \ncatalyst for economic growth but the benefits depend on how well it is managed (i.e., whether it \nresults in quality and stable public service delivery). The government has carried out key reforms \nto improve public investment management. The reforms involve improving the predictability and \nplanning  of  public  investment  by  adopting  the  Tuvalu  Infrastructure  Strategy  and  Investment \nStrategy, 2016\u20132025.16 This broader plan is supported by the Building Act and asset management \nframework  that  help  the  government  operationalize  the  Tuvalu  Infrastructure  Strategy  and \n\n                                                \n13 Tuvalu\u2019s  Climate  Change  Policy  2012\u20132021  guides  interventions  for  responding  to  climate  change  impacts  and \nrelated disaster risks and is linked to Tuvalu\u2019s National Strategic Action Plan for Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement. \n\n14 Government of Tuvalu. 2015. Public Financial Management Roadmap, 2015\u20132018. Funafuti. \n15 Key PFM assessment documents include the 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment, \nannual  auditor  general\u2019s  reports,  and  the  2018  Assessment  of  National  Systems  (ANS)  conducted  by  the \nGovernment of Australia. \n\n16 Government of Tuvalu. 2015. Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan, 2016\u20132025. Funafuti. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fInvestment Strategy and links to budgeting and implementation. The government, with support \nfrom  ADB  and  IMF\u2019s  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre,  is  working  on  a  multiyear \ninfrastructure budget for 2020, which will allow rollover funds for infrastructure development and \nincrease  the  efficiency  of  public  infrastructure  management.  This  will  prevent  having  to \nappropriate  budget  every  year  for  major  infrastructure  projects  and  facilitate  the  planning  and \nmanagement  of  infrastructure  projects  and  maintenance  works.  However,  infrastructure \ndevelopment and management in Tuvalu remains challenging because of a lack of economies of \nscale,  high  transport  costs,  a  harsh  climate,  and  limited  skills  and  technical  capacity.  Physical \npublic investments are often not managed and maintained properly, eventually posing fiscal risks, \nimpacting the quality of public service delivery, and compromising public health and safety. The \nharsh climate also causes physical infrastructure assets to corrode and age quickly. An outdated \nbuilding code and lack of enabling legislation have also hindered the establishment of systems \nfor  regulatory  implementation  and  the  designation  of  public  and  private  responsibilities  for \nresilience in Tuvalu\u2019s built environment.17 As the scale, frequency, and severity of natural hazards \ncontinue  to  rise,  Tuvalu  will  experience  losses  in  the  built  environment  that  will  disrupt  public \nservices and financial and economic inefficiencies of the asset, and threaten human lives. \n \n10. \nADB  engagement.  ADB  has  a  long  history  of  providing  budget  support  and  TA  in \npartnership  with  development  partners  to  help  implement  the  government\u2019s  public  sector \nmanagement reform priorities.18 In 2012, the government embarked on a comprehensive reform \nprogram, resulting in the adoption of the PRM containing time-bound reform actions, each one \nsupported by development partners according to their areas of comparative advantage (footnote \n4). ADB\u2019s policy-based grants in 2012 and 2015, totaling $4.3 million, supported critical reform \nactions, including (i) establishing fiscal ratios to enable the government to better monitor its fiscal \nperformance;19 (ii)  establishing revenue  and expenditure review  committees  in 2012  to  identify \nnew sources of revenue and advise the cabinet on strategies to control costs; (iii) strengthening \npublic procurement through the development of the 2012 National Procurement Policy, the Public \nProcurement  Act  2013,  and  the  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2014  and  establishing  the \nCentral  Procurement  Unit  (CPU)  in  2015; 20  (iv)  strengthening  the  accounting  and  auditing \npractices of public enterprises to improve their transparency and accountability and encouraging \ngreater private sector participation;21 and (v) changing the financial instructions under the Public \nFinance Act in 2015 to transform the CIF into a fiscal stabilization fund and to better insulate the \nbudget and the economy from external shocks.22 These reforms, together with those supported \nby  other  development  partners,  demonstrate  long-term  engagement  based  on  the  PRM  to \nimprove  public  sector  management  and  service  delivery.  The  sequenced  provision  of \n\n                                                \n17 A draft building code was first published in Tuvalu in 1990 as part of the Pacific Buildings Standards Project led by \n\nthe Government of Australia. \n\n18 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to Tuvalu for \nthe Improved Public Financial Management Program. Manila; and two stand-alone operations approved in 2012 and \n2015 (footnote 3). \n\n19 The seven fiscal ratios are (i) tax revenue to GDP target of 20%, (ii) recurrent expenditure to GDP target of 60%, (iii) \nwages and salaries to domestic revenue target of 55%, (iv) Tuvalu overseas medical treatment scheme to domestic \nrevenue target of 6%, (v) Tuvalu overseas scholarship scheme to domestic revenue target of 5%, (vi) primary balance \nto GDP target of 11%, and (vii) net present value of public debt to GDP target of 30%. \n\n20 CPU oversees procurement and developed standard bidding documents. The publication of the CPU annual report \nand  the  development  of  a  centralized  procurement  website  have  also  helped  strengthen  public  procurement \ngovernance. \n\n21 Examples include the concession sale of the government-owned hotel to the Tuvalu National Provident Fund. \n22 Changes  to  existing  accumulation  and  withdrawal  rules  have  helped  regulate  the  use  of  the  CIF  and  ensure  its \nreplenishment,  avoiding  ad  hoc  fiscal  tightening  and  the  need  to  search  for  new,  economically  harmful  revenue \nsources during economic downturns. The target CIF savings balance will be at least 16% of the maintained value of \nthe TTF and regulated through a CIF contributions and savings plan. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\ndevelopment  partner  grants  also  helps  the  government  deliver  their  policy  priorities,  such  as \neducation,  health,  basic  services  in  the  outer  islands,  and  climate  change  resilience. \nComplementary ADB and development partner TA has helped support the government\u2019s efforts \non these reforms.23 \n \n11. \nLessons learned. The design and modality of the program reflects several lessons from \nprevious budget support operations in Tuvalu and the Pacific and the 2015 evaluation of the PRM \nfinanced by the Government of Australia. Major lessons include (i) budget support can achieve \nresults if there is strong government ownership; (ii) close coordination with development partners \nis critical for advancing reforms in sectors where ADB has limited engagement; (iii) TA support, \ncoordinated across development partners and provided parallel to budget support programs, can \nhelp push the reform agenda; (iv) flexibility helps ensure that policy actions remain relevant and \nup-to-date on the latest evidence and conditions; (v) limiting reforms to a few substantive actions \nand sequencing implementation prevents overloading the national capacity; (vi) institutionalizing \njoint  government\u2013development  partner  coordination  mechanisms  reduces  the  demands  on \nlimited government  capacity;  and  (vii)  deep institutional  and structural  change requires  time to \nbecome  established.24 ADB\u2019s  prior  policy-based  grants  have  been  single-tranche,  stand-alone \noperations, with continuity provided through TA and policy dialogue coordinated through the PRM \nprocess. Since the approach has led to good results (para. 4), ADB will continue to use it for the \nprogram. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nGovernment  development  strategy.  In  its  eighth  national  development  plan\u2013\u2013the \nNational Strategy for Sustainable Development, 2016\u20132020\u2013\u2013Tuvalu foresees a more protected, \nsecure, and prosperous country; healthier people who are more engaged in national, regional, \nand international forums; and a government that encourages input from the community to improve \nproject  development  so  development  efforts  are  sustained  and  adopted  by  the  community. \nClimate change cuts across all 12 priority areas of the national development plan as sea level rise \nposes  the  most  significant  threat  to  Tuvalu\u2019s  survival. 25  With  support  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  political \nleadership, the broad-based ownership of the policy reform program is strong and institutionalized \nthrough government-led coordination with development partners.26 \n \n13. \nPartner coordination. Since 2012, ADB, the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, \nthe European Union, and the World Bank have been closely coordinating their budget support \nand TA operations through joint development and monitoring of the PRM. From 2012 to 2018, \nthis  partnership  has  helped  support  government  reforms  focused  on  PFM,  fiscal  policy,  public \nadministration, public enterprise performance and rationalization, health, and education (footnote \n4).  Since there  has  been progress  in these areas,  ADB  and other  development  partners  have \nprovided $27.4 million in general budget support. An estimated $14.6 million in combined budget \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2008.

The IMF has provided an assessment \nletter.27 \n \n14. \nProgram  description.  This  will  be  ADB\u2019s  third  program  to  support  the  PRM  and  will \nfacilitate reforms specific to improving PFM and infrastructure management. All six policy actions \nsupported by ADB have been completed (Appendix 4).28 ADB has added value through extensive \npolicy dialogue and TA support29 that has helped government to identify, prioritize, and implement \nthe policy actions under the program. The program policy actions are outlined in paras. 15\u201316. \n \n15. \nReform area 1: policies and processes for public financial management improved. \nPolicy actions focus on developing sound policy and processes to strengthen PFM and improve \nthe  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  of  Tuvalu\u2019s  public  financial  system  and  practices. \nEffective  PFM  systems  help  strengthen  transparency  and  accountability  and  build  public \nconfidence in the government\u2019s ability to deliver timely and high-quality public service delivery. \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\nPublic  financial  management  reform  strategy.  Tuvalu\u2019s  PFM  has  improved \nthrough the government\u2019s strong commitment to implementing the PFM Roadmap, \n2015\u20132018, which has led to greater macroeconomic stability and improved  the \nquality  of  public  expenditures. 30  The  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability (PEFA) self-assessment and the Assessment of National Systems \n(ANS) conducted by the Government of Australia in 2018 highlight procurement \nand  treasury  functions  as  remaining  weaknesses  in  fiscal  management  posing \nfiduciary  risks  and  implementation  delays  of  PFM  reforms.  Based  on  these \nassessments, the cabinet approved a PFM Reform Strategy, 2019\u20132021 to target \nthese weaknesses as a prior action. The road map prioritizes four main areas for \nimprovement,  and  implementation  will  be  tracked  and  reflected  in  future  PEFA \nassessments. The priorities include (a) improve the medium-term fiscal framework \nand  credibility  of  the  budget,  (b)  review  financial  legislation  and  subsidiary \nguidelines,  (c)  improve  the  capability  and  use  of  the  government  financial \nmanagement  and  information  system,  and  (d)  build  PFM  capacity  and  service \ndelivery. \nPublic financial reporting strategy. The government\u2019s fiscal vulnerabilities are \nassociated  with  the  credibility  of  the  government  financial  accounting  system, \npartly because of discrepancies associated with using both cash accounting and \npartial accrual accounting. Although the government adopted accrual accounting \nin 2012, the existing accounting practice is still on cash and partial accrual basis. \nThere is a mismatch in the reporting of accounts versus the auditing of financial \nstatements by the auditor general\u2019s office, creating inefficiencies in the use of staff \ntime  and  in  reporting  the  government\u2019s  finances.  As  a  prior  action,  the  cabinet \nendorsed  a  strategy  towards  a  full  accrual  accounting  system.  The  strategy \nidentifies weaknesses in existing accounting practices and provides guidelines for \neach implementation phase of the transition from cash and partial accrual to full \naccrual accounting by 2024. \n\n                                                \n27 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The six policy actions in the PRM (Appendix 4) supported by ADB are 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.2. Development \npartners are supporting a combination of reform actions under the jointly agreed PRM, according to their areas  of \nexpertise, operational priorities, and alignment with their bilateral support programs in Tuvalu.  \n\n29  ADB. 2017.

Public Financial Management Roadmap, 2015\u20132018. Funafuti. The reforms draw from \n\nthe Government of Tuvalu\u2019s 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability self-assessment. \n\n\f(iii)  Public  finance  legislation.  The  Public  Finance  Act  2008  does  not  specify  the \naccounting method to be used for public sector financial reporting. To ensure the \nconsistency of financial reporting, budget planning, and public finance in general, \nlegislation needs to be amended to ensure the government complies with Tuvalu\u2019s \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Practices (adopted in 2012), which are based on \nan  accrual financial  management  system  and  align with the  International  Public \nSector Accounting Standards and the International Financial Reporting Standards. \nAs  a  prior  action,  the  Parliament  of  Tuvalu  approved  the  Public  Finance \n(Amendment)  Act  in  April  2019  to  ensure  national  accounts  are  prepared  in  a \nconsistent  format  and  based  on  an  accrual  financial  management  system.  This \nprior  action  is  one  of the  requirements  identified in  the  public financial reporting \nstrategy that will guide the government towards a full accrual accounting practice \nby 2024. \nPublic  procurement.  Public  procurement  is  still  recognized  as  an  area  of \nsignificant  weakness  in  PFM,  particularly  with  regard  to  compliance  and \nenforceability. The prior actions build on public procurement reforms implemented \nby the government since 2012. As prior actions, the cabinet endorsed the public \nprocurement  manual  and  associated  guidelines.  The  manual  will  guide \ngovernment  staff  through  the  public  procurement  process,  the  procurement \ncomplaints  and  appeals  procedure,  and  the  procurement  suspension  and \ndebarment  procedure.  The  improved  public  procurement  system  will  promote \npublic confidence in the integrity and fairness of procurement proceedings. It will \nalso  help  ensure  better  value  for  money  and  higher-quality  goods  and  services \ndelivered by sound suppliers. These administrative processes do not substitute for \nthe  legal  process,  which  the  Government  of  Tuvalu  may  pursue  for  suspension \nand debarment. \n\n(iv) \n\n \n16. \nReform  area  2:  institutional  and legal  frameworks  for  infrastructure  management \nimproved. Policy actions under this reform area focus on strengthening Tuvalu\u2019s institutional and \nlegal framework to better construct, manage, and maintain public and private physical assets to \nbetter equip government to manage infrastructure investments that will improve service delivery. \nPrior  to  this  reform,  there  was  no  framework  to  manage  public  capital  investments.  The \ngovernment  also  had  limited  awareness  about  the  quality  of  its  assets  to  inform  investment \ndecisions and to determine operational and maintenance costs. The strengthened framework will \nlimit associated fiscal risks because of poor capital budget planning and improve the quality of \npublic service delivery. These policy actions will also help mitigate the risks of direct damage to \ninfrastructure, including critical public facilities and residential buildings, and contain budgetary \nburdens for disaster recovery. \n\n(i) \n\nTuvalu  Asset  Management  Framework. The construction  and maintenance  of \ninfrastructure  assets  is  challenging  and  costly  in  Tuvalu  because  of  a  lack  of \neconomies of scale, high transport costs, and a harsh climate.31 As a prior action, \nthe  cabinet  endorsed  the  Tuvalu  Asset  Management  Framework  (TAMF).  The \nframework  applies  to  all  physical  infrastructure  (buildings,  roads,  water  and \nsanitation, coastal protection, and transport infrastructure) with an individual asset \nvalue  greater  than  $10,000,  owned  by  the  national  government,  local  island \ncouncils,  and  major  public  sector  enterprises.  The  framework  helps  identify  the \n\n                                                \n31 The TAMF is linked to the Tuvalu Infrastructure Strategy and Investment Plan, 2016\u20132025. As the custodian of all \nmajor  infrastructure  assets,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Utilities  and  Infrastructure  Implementation  will  commence  the \nimplementation  of  the  TAMF.  Incremental  implementation  supported  by  TA  from  development  partners  is \nrecommended for this framework because of the varying capacities of different ministries. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nmaintenance requirements and replacement needs of public sector infrastructure \nassets  and  ensure  that  they  deliver  their  intended  functions  with  economic \nefficiency throughout their service life. The framework also aims to improve asset \nperformance and resilience and extend assets\u2019 service life by (a) building sufficient \nresilience  in  infrastructure  design  to  reduce  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  and \nclimate change impacts; (b) monitoring asset condition through simple, practical, \nand  low-cost  techniques  and  taking  prompt  corrective  action  when  needed;  (c) \nreplacing the current reactive maintenance strategy with a planned preventative \nmaintenance  program;  and  (d)  maintaining  adequate  records  to  allow  the \nperformance of assets to be benchmarked, and creating institutional memory. \nBuilding legislation and code. Although the building code was developed in 1990, \nthere was no enabling legal framework passed for its implementation. This lack of \nenabling  legislation  has  hindered  the  establishment  of  systems  for  regulatory \nimplementation  and  the  designation  of  public  and  private  responsibilities  for \nresilience  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  built  environment.  The  building  code  of  1990  also did  not \nconsider disaster risk reduction and climate change impacts. As a prior action, the \nParliament of Tuvalu approved the Building Act in July 2019, and the minister for \npublic  utilities  and  infrastructure  endorsed  the  draft  building  code,  which  will  be \nfinalized  when  public  consultations  are  completed.  The  building  code  and \nassociated legislation will ensure construction adheres to acceptable standards of \nstructural sufficiency, safety, climate resilience, and amenities for the public. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \nC. \n \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  the  objectives  of  the  National  Strategy  for  Sustainable \n17. \nDevelopment,  2016\u20132020  (footnote  25)  of  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  efficient, \nhigh-quality,  and  resilient  infrastructure  and  support  services.  The  reform  aims  to  improve  the \nmanagement of public finances and national infrastructure. The program will support efforts in two \nreform  areas.  Under  reform  area  1,  Tuvalu\u2019s  PFM  will  be  improved  through  the  PFM  Reform \nStrategy 2019\u20132021, the transition towards full accrual accounting in compliance with Tuvalu\u2019s \nGenerally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles,  and  strengthened  public  procurement  by  putting  in \nplace  mechanisms  for  redress  and  noncompliance.  Under  reform  area  2,  improvements  to \nbuilding  standards  and  management  of  national  infrastructure  will  help  enhance  resilience  to \ndisasters and ensure service delivery with economic efficiency throughout the service life of the \ninfrastructure.  These  reforms  help  improve  overall  efficiency  in  public  resource  allocation  and \nutilization. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nThe government estimates a domestic financing gap of $22.5 million in 2019, which will \nbe financed by savings, drawdown from the CIF, and development partner grants. In 2019, budget \nsupport grants to Tuvalu are estimated to total $21.9 million, of which $14.6 million (64.0% of the \n2019 projected domestic fiscal deficit) will be through the PRM budget support program. Of this, \nthe  government  has  requested  a  policy-based  grant  of  $4.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  allocation for Tuvalu.  PRM  budget  support grants  also include $1.5 million \nfrom the European Union, $1.0 million from the Government of Australia, $0.6 million from the \nGovernment  of  New  Zealand,  and  $7.5 million from the World  Bank.32 The grant  proceeds  will \nalso support the government to deliver their national policy priorities.33 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n                                                \n32 These are parallel collaborative partner financing not administered by ADB. \n33 The Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) highlights the Government\u2019s vision, policy platform, and priorities. \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n \nE. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) will be the executing agency \n19. \nfor the program. Through the existing institutional structure for aid management in Tuvalu, it will \noversee  the  implementation  of  agreed  policy  actions  and  be  responsible  for  program \nadministration, disbursements, and the maintenance of all records. The MFED and the Ministry \nof  Public  Utilities  and  Infrastructure  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  the  program.  The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n20. \nGovernance. Promoting good governance is a key national priority. The government is \ncommitted to implementing the PFM Reform Roadmap 2019\u20132021 to close the gaps identified \nthrough the 2015 PEFA and the 2018 ANS. Despite capacity limitations, the assessments indicate \nthat, compared with international best practice, Tuvalu\u2019s PFM system operates mostly at average \nlevels.  The  government  has  the  ability  to  implement  its  budget,  but  there  are  weaknesses  in \nprocurement,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  and  auditing.  Reform  area  1,  complemented  by \ndevelopment partner TA, addresses some of these weaknesses.34 The joint policy dialogue with \ndevelopment partners on reform priorities will continue to be key in maintaining the government\u2019s \nreform momentum. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with MFED and the government. \n \n21. \nPoverty and social. The policy actions supported under reform area 1 are likely to have \npositive impacts on poverty reduction. Reforms in financial management practices lead to greater \nmacroeconomic stability and improved quality of public expenditure. Successful implementation \nof  these reforms  would  provide  a foundation  for  improved  performance  in government  service \ndelivery, including in sectors (e.g., health and education) that are vital for improving the lives of \nthe poor and vulnerable. Reforms on procurement implementation would also increase efficiency \nand transparency of government expenditures. The policy actions supported under reform area 2 \nwill have a positive impact on the resilience of the poor and vulnerable to climate and disaster-\nrelated shocks. Improving the climate and disaster resilience of public assets (through the asset \nmanagement framework) and private assets (through the building code) can protect the poor from \ndirect  losses  and  disruptions  to  public  services.  The  policy  actions  would  have  a  substantial \npositive impact on the well-being of all citizens but particularly on the poor and vulnerable, who \nare more reliant on public services and more exposed to disaster risks because of a lack of formal \nsafety nets. \n \n22. \nSafeguards.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is \nclassified  category  C  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms. The prior policy actions have \nbeen assessed and are not expected to result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or negatively \naffect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \n23. \nGender.  The  program  is  classified  no  gender  elements.  Although  the  improved \nmanagement of public finances and national infrastructure will benefit all, the program contains \n\n                                                \n34 Long-term  advisors,  financed  through  the  Government  of  Australia\u2019s  Pacific  Technical  Assistance  Mechanism, \nsupplement human resources in Tuvalu\u2019s Department of Budget and Planning, Treasury, and Tax and Audit Offices. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nno proactive gender design features. Program preparation discussions with the government and \ndevelopment  partners  identified  relevant  gender  issues,  in  particular  the  potential  for  gender-\nresponsive budgeting and procurement, and gender actions related to the implementation of the \nBuilding  Act  and  draft  building  code.35 However,  the  government\u2019s  readiness to  address  these \nareas will need further discussions with the government and development partners and TA will be \nneeded  to  build  capacity.  ADB  will  explore  including  appropriate  actions  in  its  subsequent \nprograms. \n \nRisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \n24. \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.36 Development  partners  assess  that \nPFM  systems  can  support  mostly  reliable  services  for  budget  support.  Policy  reforms  and  TA \nsupport address the remaining fiduciary risks. The program\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government cannot implement \npolicy reform actions because it \nlacks the institutional capacity. \n\nExternal shocks (from disasters, \nclimate change, and global \neconomic conditions) impact the \nfiscal position and/or divert political \nfocus from reform. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nReforms are prioritized and sequenced to avoid overburdening the small \npublic administration and decision makers. Technical assistance is \nmobilized by development partners on a needs basis to supplement \ncapacity. \nThe government conservatively estimates revenues and grants to provide a \ncushion against external uncertainties. The government also has a \nsufficient fiscal buffer in the Consolidated Investment Fund, is eligible for \ncontingent disaster financing from the Asian Development Bank, has \nestablished the Tuvalu Survival Fund, and will seek development partner \nassistance in case of disasters. \n\nSource. Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n25. \nThe government and the MFED have assured ADB that the implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  grant  agreement.  The  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n26. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant  not  exceeding  $4,000,000  to  Tuvalu,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Improved Fiscal and Infrastructure Management Program, on terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n35 These are aligned with Tuvalu\u2019s National Gender Policy (2016) and the National Disability Policy (2018). \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 October 2019 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nPrudent management of the macroeconomic status of the economy (Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020)a \nEfficient, high-quality infrastructure, and support services provided (Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132020)a \n \n \nResults Chain \nEffect of the Reform \n \nImproved management of \npublic finances and \nnational infrastructure \n\n \nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\nBy 2021: \n \na.
