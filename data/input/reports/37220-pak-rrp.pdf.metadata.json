An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  has \nbeen  prepared  to  guide  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects \nduring implementation.  \n\nin \n\ninstitutional \n\ninvestments \n\nThe Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program (the Investment \nProgram  or  SCIP)  aims  to  improve  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  services  in \nclusters  of  secondary  cities  in  Sindh  Province,  thus  enhancing  the \nurban environment, public health, and economic opportunities for an \nestimated 4 million urban residents of participating secondary cities. \nThis will be achieved through an integrated program of physical and \nnonphysical \nreforms  and  priority \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovements.  Urban  services \ncorporations  (USCs),  established  as  public  limited  companies  by \nparticipating  local  governments  to  deliver  the  services,  represent  a \ncore institutional reform. The Investment Program has four parts: (i) \npart  A:  urban  planning,  institutional  development,  and  program \nimplementation  support  for  program  execution  and  institutional \nreforms;  (ii)  part  B:  water  supply  and  wastewater  management \nimprovements  to  boost  service  coverage,  quality,  and  reliability \nthrough  civil  works  and  equipment  provision;  (iii)  part  C:  SWM \nimprovements comprising the provision of civil works and equipment \nrequired  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  sanitary  landfill \nfacilities,  solid  waste  collection  equipment,  and  communal  waste \nbins;  and  (iv)  part  D:  operational  and  transition  support  funding  to \ncover  cash  shortfalls  in  the  newly  established  USCs  in  advance  of \nplanned tariff increases and greater cost recovery. \n \nParts  B  and  C  will  finance  physical  outputs  including  (i)  increased \nconnections to piped water supply and reduced system leakage; (ii) \nincreased  wastewater  disposal  and  capacity \nfor  wastewater \ntreatment;  and  (iii)  development  of  sanitary  landfills  and  increased \naccess to solid waste collection.   \n \nParts  A  and  D  will  finance  non-physical  outputs  including  (i) \nimproved  institutions  and  incentives  for  urban  service  delivery;  (ii) \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nMultitranche \nFinance Facility \nModality \n\ntariffs;  and \n\nincreased  efficiency \n\ncapacity  development  for  better  system  planning,  operations  and \nmaintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  through  metering,  billing \nand  collection \nthrough \n(iv) \npredictable  recurrent  financing  and  performance-based  contracting \nand private sector participation. \n \nThe Government of Pakistan has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to extend financing for the Investment Program through \na  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  The  requested  MFF  totals \n$300  million \ninvestments,  capacity \ndevelopment,  operational  funding  shortfalls,  and  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s implementation costs. The MFF modality is justified based \non the following: \n(i) \n\nThe  MFF  establishes  a  foundation  for  a  10-year  partnership \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Sindh  (GOS)  to \nrevitalize Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities. \nIt  avoids  the  piecemeal  approach  of  past  urban  projects  by \nbuilding a broad platform for engaging GOS on core reforms. \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfinance \n\n(ii) \n\nto \n\n(iii)  The  modality  provides  for  logical  sequencing  of  interrelated \nphysical  and  nonphysical  investments  over  the  medium-term \nto  support  long-term  GOS  objectives  for  balanced  urban \ndevelopment.  \nIt  allows  phasing  of  physical  investments  in  new  \u201ctown \nclusters\u201d  once  institutional  reforms  are  in  place  and  USCs \nestablished.  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  Multiple tranches provide flexibility to adjust investment levels, \nwith  tranche  amounts  increasing  over  time  as  a  corporate \nmodel  is  adopted  and  geographical  coverage  of  USCs \nincreases.  \n\n(vi)  The  MFF  allows  piloting  of  approaches, \n\nthen  applying \nexperience to subsequent tranches and town clusters for more \nefficient implementation. \n\n(vii)  Financing on an as-needed basis can lower transaction costs. \n(viii)  The MFF shifts focus to implementation, rather than repetitive \nprocessing  tasks,  while  internalizing  subproject  preparation \nskills. \nIt  complements  ADB\u2019s  proposed  MFF  for  urban  development \nin  Karachi,  providing  a  balanced  approach  to  province-wide \nurban development. \n\n(ix) \n\n \nConditions  for  an  MFF  are  satisfied.  The  sector  strategy  and  policy \nframework,  including  actionable  reforms,  investment  program,  and \nfinancing  plan  are  in  Appendix  3.  Management  and  institutional \nreforms  are  front-loaded  to  establish  a  foundation  for  physical \ninvestment. \n \nSindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities  are  under  increasing  stress  of  population \ngrowth and urban poverty. The provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices has not kept pace with the population. Inadequate planning \nand  management  of  infrastructure  services  keeps  costs  high  and \nquality  low  while  impeding  Sindh\u2019s  economic  competitiveness. \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nthe \n\nDeteriorating  urban  services  add  to  business  costs,  damage  the \nurban  environment,  diminish  the  quality  of  life,  and  discourage \npotential  investment.  Devolution  reforms  have  had  disappointing \neffect  since  2001.  While  providing  scope  for  more  effective  service \nprovision,  improvements  are  hindered  by  continuing  overlaps  and \nfragmentation  of  responsibilities  between \ntaluka  municipal \nadministrations  (TMAs)  and  provincial-level  agencies.  Alternative \napproaches  to  service  provision,  including  infrastructure  planning \nand  construction,  are  needed  to  address  the  challenges  facing \nSindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities.  Service  delivery  needs  to  be  separated \nfrom system regulation and political interest. Service provision needs \nto  be  progressively  placed  on  a  commercial  and  self-sustaining \nbasis, leveraging private sector expertise and incentive structures as \nappropriate. \n   \nThe Investment Program\u2019s impact will be improved health and quality \nof  life  for  an  estimated  4  million  residents  in  Sindh\u2019s  participating \nsecondary  towns  and  improved  economic  competitiveness  of  the \ntowns.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  quality,  coverage,  and \nreliability  of  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  for  an \nestimated 570,000 households in participating cities, through reforms \nthat  include  introducing  well-managed,  financially  sustainable  urban \nservice providers and more effective urban planning, while creating a \nplatform for increased private sector participation in the sector. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $400 \nmillion, of which $300 million would be covered under the MFF. The \nestimated  total  needs  for  infrastructure  services  investment  under \nthe  sector  road  map  and  investment  program  is  an  estimated  $2.3 \nbillion for the period 2008\u20132030. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \nSource \nWater Supply Infrastructure \nWastewater Management Infrastructure \nSolid Waste Management  \nInstitutional Reform and Development \n \n\nSector Investment Plan \nSector \nInvestment \nPlan  \n2008\u20132030 \n($ million) \n950 \n980 \n250 \n95 \n2,275 \n\nTotal \n\n \nInvestment \nProgram \n2009\u20132018 \n\n($ million) \n150.0 \n150.0 \n40.0 \n60.0 \n400.0 \n\n(%) \n16 \n15 \n16 \n63 \n18 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nInvestment Program Financing Plan \n\n \n \n\nInvestment \nProgram \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n\n($ million) \n300.0 \n100.0 \n400.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\nTranche 1 \n\n(%) \n75 \n25 \n100 \n\n($ million) \n38.0 \n12.0 \n50.0 \n\n(%) \n76 \n24 \n100 \n\nImpact and \nOutcome \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nThe Investment Program is divided into five tranches, with tranche 1 \ncovering eight subprojects.

Each \nloan  will  be  extended  to  finance  projects  subject  to  submission  of \nrelated  periodic  financing  requests  (PFR)  by  the  Government.  The \nGovernment intends to finance the Program by submitting five PFRs. \nThe first PFR amount is $38 million. The last loan is expected to be \nutilized no later than 31 December 2018.   \n \nThe OCR loans will have an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  annum,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan and project agreements as applicable. Each loan will be for \na  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years.  The  Special \nFunds resources under tranche 1 will have a 32-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  with  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nThe Government has options to choose between eligible currencies \nand  the  interest  rate  regime  most  suitable  for  each  loan.  ADB  also \nprovides  flexibility  in  terms  of  repayment  and  interest  swaps  during \nthe  financing  period.  Repayment  schedules  can  be  structured  for \neach  loan  to  match  the  needs  of  each  batch  of  subprojects  with \nregard to their cost-recovery and sustainability profiles. \n \nThe  Government  will  onlend  to  GOS  at  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as those for ADB loans to the Government. GOS will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk for all loans.  \n \nFinancing may be made available provided the Investment Program \nis  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  general  understandings  and \nexpectations  upon  which  the  MFF  is  based,  as  laid  out  in  the  FFA. \nProgress  toward  the  expected  outcomes  and  set  out  in  the  design \n\nMultitranche \nFinancing Facility \nAmount and Terms \n\n \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nthe \n\nsafeguard \n\nand monitoring framework and the action plan for reform will be part \nof the decision-making criteria and filters for continuing ADB support. \nCompliance  with \nsocial \ndevelopment policies, and with all other undertakings set forth in the \nFFA  will  also  guide  ADB\u2019s  decision  to  continue  financing  under \nindividual tranches. \n \nUntil  31  December  2018  (with  the  last  PFR  submission  by  31 \nDecember 2016) \n \n\nrequirements  and \n\n30 June 2018 \n\nThe Planning and Development Department (P&DD) of the GOS \n \nProgram Support Unit (PSU) has been established to support overall \nInvestment  Program  implementation;  the  PSU  will  promote  urban \nreforms and roll-out the USC model to town clusters, beginning with \nthe North Sindh Urban Services Corporation (NSUSC). The PSU will \noversee submission of the periodic financing requests (PFR), report \non and evaluate results, oversee safeguards compliance, coordinate \namong  provincial  agencies,  prepare  progress  reports,  monitor  and \nevaluate,  oversee  safeguard  requirements,  and  engage  with  the \nindependent  verifier  to  implement  Part  D  funding  for  USC  recurrent \ncosts.      An urban  policy  and  strategic  planning unit  (the  urban  unit) \nwill  be  established  to  provide  urban  planning  and  policy  support  for \nurban development in Sindh. The urban unit will collaborate with the \nPSU  to  champion  reforms  and  roll-out  the  USC  model  to  new  town \nclusters.  A  Program  Steering  Committee  (PSC),  chaired  by \nadditional chief secretary (development), will provide policy direction \nand strategic oversight.  \n \nUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  subprojects  and \nmanaging  services  delivery  within  their  coverage  areas.  Each  USC \nwill be headed by a managing director and professional management \nteam to be recruited competitively from the open market. USCs will, \namong others, (i) prepare business plans and operating budgets, (ii) \nbe  responsible  for  the  procurement  process,  (iii)  conduct  due \ndiligence on subsequent tranche investment, (iii) ensure safeguards \ncompliance,  (iv)  prepare  PFRs  for  submission  to  the  PSU,  and  (v) \nreport on progress and measure results. \n \nA  detailed  implementation  plan  identifies  specific  tasks  and  time \nto  establish  project  management  structures,  execute \nframes \ninfrastructure  subprojects  and  implement  reforms.    The  draft  facility \nadministration  manual  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A  incorporates \nthis  plan \ntimely  and  effective \nimplementation.  This  manual  adopts  a  substantive,  but  concise, \nformat intended to increase its use by the EA and USCs. \n \n\nto  guide  rapid  start-up, \n\nthen \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n\nEstimated  \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n \n\nImplementation \nPlan \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAll  procurement  under  the  MFF  will  be  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A \nprocurement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  under  the \nMFF.   \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures,  consultant  qualification  selection \nand/or individual consultant selection procedures in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Quality-based  selection  may  be  required  where \ntechnical  expertise  is  the  overriding  requirement.  Where  it  can  be \nreasonably justified, single-source selection may be necessary.

The  design  and  monitoring  frameworks  for  the \nMFF and tranche 1 are in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn  its  medium-term  development  framework  (2005\u20132010),  the  Government  of  Pakistan  \nhas  committed  to  making  towns  and  cities  more  efficient  and  competitive  to  help  accelerate \nnational growth and productivity. The Government cites need for enhanced urban planning and \nmanagement  capabilities,  stronger  public-private  partnerships,  and \nintegrated  urban \ndevelopment. This includes balanced development and improving basic urban services across \nlarge, medium, and small cities to enhance their productivity and competitiveness, as well as to \nimprove quality of life for their citizens. The Government has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to help finance a part of a strategic and phased investment program targeting urban \nrevitalization in second-tier towns of interior Sindh.1 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSindh  is  the  second  most  populous  province  in  Pakistan.  It  is  becoming  highly \nurbanized,  with  nearly  half  of  its  population  (some  19  million)  living  in  urban  areas.  While  the \nvast majority of this urban population (about 70%) lives in Karachi or Hyderabad, many of the \nnearly 6 million people scattered across Sindh live in more than 20 secondary cities with urban \npopulations exceeding 50,000. Economic growth in these secondary cities lags that of Karachi \nand cities in Punjab. When provincial figures are adjusted for Karachi, the relative stagnation in \neconomic  growth  in  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities  is  clear.  While  the  annual  per  capita  income  in \nKarachi is about $2,000, the figure for secondary cities in Sindh hovers around $200. That is far \nbelow  the  national  average  of  $925  per  annum.  Barriers  to  economic  growth  include,  among \nothers,  poor  water  and  power  supplies,  inadequate  connectivity  to  Karachi,  insufficient  skilled \nlabor,  and  political  uncertainty.  The  implications  for  income  generation  and  poverty  levels  are \npronounced.  In  the  absence  of  economic  opportunity,  reliable  urban  services,  and  a  safe, \nsecure, and predictable business environment, these secondary cities will continue to lose their \nyouth to Karachi and fall behind their peer cities in Punjab.2   \n \n4. \nPoverty Indicators. Income poverty in Pakistan declined between 2001 and 2005 owing \nto  strong  provincial  economic  growth  and  increased  pro-poor  government  spending.  The \npoverty headcount ratio declined from 34.5% in FY2001 to 23.9% in FY2005, then to 22.3% in \nFY2006.3 A  large  portion  of  the  population  remains  vulnerable,  however,  and  the  income  and \nexpenditure  gaps  between  the  poor  and  wealthier  strata  (and  especially  the  urban  rich)  have \nwidened.  While  urban  Sindh  is  the  least  deprived  area  nationally,  this  is  largely  due  to  the \npredominant affect of Karachi. One fourth of Sindh\u2019s urban areas fall into the category of high \ndeprivation, which is indicative of the development gap between Karachi and Sindh\u2019s secondary \ntowns. Urban poverty in Sindh is multifaceted, ranging from deficiencies in basic urban services \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The poverty levels of participating towns range from 40% to 50%.4 Significant \ndisparities exist between more developed neighborhoods and the katchi abadis (or slum areas).   \n \n5. \nNational  and  Provincial-Level  Urban  Service  Performance.  Effective  urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  are  prerequisites  for  sustainable  economic  growth,  yet  Pakistan\u2019s \nurban  sector  performance  indicators  have  stagnated  on  the  whole.  Urban  water  supply \ncoverage  increased  by  only  1%  during  2000  to  2004,  after  remaining  at  95%  nationwide  over \nthe prior decade. The number of household connections to piped water decreased from 60% in \n1990  to  49%  in  2004,  reflecting  both  population  growth  and  apparent  flagging  performance  of \ngovernment-managed  water  utilities.  While  access  to  improved  sanitation  rose  in  Pakistan\u2019s \nurban areas from 82% in 1990 to 92% in 2004, the proportion of households having sewerage \nconnections declined from 45% to 40% over this same period. Solid waste management (SWM) \nservices lag as well. Only 57% of urban households have access to garbage collection systems. \nUrban  service  delivery  performance  in  interior  Sindh  compares  poorly  against  these  national \nindicators  and,  together  with  environmental  conditions,  is  deteriorating  (para.  7).  Again, \nprovincial  figures  can  be  misleading,  as  relatively  better  conditions  in  Karachi  mask  poorer \nperformance in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns.   \n \nB. \n\nKey Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nAppendix 2 presents a problem tree analysis. The core problem is poor service delivery, \nparticularly  poor  quality,  continuity,  and  coverage  of  drinking  water,  sanitation,  and  SWM \nservices.  Ineffective  institutional  arrangements,  distorted  incentives,  weak  accountability,  and \npoor  governance  are  causal  factors.  Aggravating  the  problems  are  a  limited  appreciation  for \nurbanization  and  its  importance  for  economic  growth  and  weak  incentives  to  plan.  Together, \nthese  contribute  to  widening  gaps  between  the  quality  of  life  in  Sindh\u2019s  secondary  towns  and \nthat in Karachi and between Sindh and the faster growing areas of Punjab. The sector road map \nand  action  plan  for  reform  and  investment  in  Appendix  3  elaborate  on  the  challenges  and \nopportunities. \n \n\n1. \n\nInadequate Services \n\n \n7. \nWater  Supply,  Wastewater,  and SWM. Urban services in Sindh\u2019s secondary cities fall \nshort against three basic targets of quality, continuity, and coverage. On average, about half of \nthe urban population in Sindh Provice outside Karachi has access to piped water, but the water \nis of poor quality and flows intermittently for only 2\u20134 hours a day. Water tariffs and collection \nefficiency are low, and limited data suggests cost recovery is minimal. Arsenic contamination is \npresent at an alarming level in Sindh\u2019s groundwater aquifer.5 Systems are so deficient that there \nis  no  reliable  measure  of  how  much  water  is  sourced  or  delivered  and  the  costs  entailed. \nAccess to sewerage and sanitary drainage (primarily open drains) varies significantly between \ntowns, but averages around 60%.6 Sanitary drainage is extremely limited; sewer lines are often \nblocked,  causing  hazardous  ponding  of  sewage  in  neighborhoods.  There  is  no  sewage \ntreatment in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns. SWM systems are generally nonexistent or rudimentary \nin  urban  centers  outside  Karachi.  Less  than  40%  of  the  population  is  served  by  garbage \ncollection  systems,  including  some  handled  by  small  private  operators.  No  sanitary  landfills \nexist; solid waste collected is disposed of by burning or illegal dumping into open spaces or the \n\n                                                 \n4  The poverty level is measured as PRs749 per person per month (Sindh Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2003).   \n5  Among northern Sindh towns, a UNICEF survey has found alarming rates in Khairpur District. Arsenic is also \n\npresent in Shikarpur, which has no piped system and relies on groundwater for supply. \n\n6  Case  studies  of  seven  towns  across  Sindh  under  the  TA  for  Preparing  the  Sindh  Basic  Urban  Services  Project \n\nfound less than 10% of the population is served by underground drains. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ndrainage  channels.  This  causes  pollution  and  blocks  the  wastewater  disposal  network, \nexacerbating sanitation problems. \n \n\n2. \n\nWeak Institutions, Incentives, Management, Accountability, and Planning \n\nIneffective Institutions. The absence of appropriate institutions for urban management \n8. \nand  service  delivery  at  taluka  municipal  administration 7  (TMA)  level  are  among  the  core \nproblems  underlying  urban  service  delivery  and  the  deterioration  of  infrastructure  in  Sindh\u2019s \nsecondary  towns.  Devolution  reforms  in  2001  transferred  political  and  administrative  powers \nover  various  services  to  elected  local  authorities,  but  financing,  skilled  management  and \nstaffing, and accountability mechanisms did not follow. The TMA structure in so-called \u201ccommon \ndistricts\u201d  does  not  lend  itself  to  the  professionalized  management  of  modern  urban  utilities  for \nlarger towns.8 A thin layer of four managerial staff is tasked with overseeing TMA responsibilities \nin  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  These  four  positions  are  frequently  vacant  or  under-filled  with \njunior staff.9 The further absence of mid-level, skilled staff means that front line service delivery \nis  left  largely  to  levels  1\u20133  staff,  with  limited  supervision.  These  structural  weaknesses  are \nexacerbated by a 10-year hiring ban and the inherent weaknesses of the civil service systems to \nattract,  retain,  and  incentivize  staff  with  specific  technical  skills.  Outside  Karachi  and \nHyderabad, there are no systems for monitoring water quality, no maps of existing water supply \nand wastewater infrastructure, no meters to measure quantities of water produced, no accurate \naccounting of service delivery costs, or even an accurate count of houses connected. \n \n9. \nDisconnect  between  Infrastructure  Construction  and  System  Management. Sindh \nProvince  is  littered  with  nonfunctioning  or  partly  operational,  inappropriately  designed  or \nredundant  water  supply  schemes.10 Government  investment  levels  have  increased  in  recent \nyears, and a steady stream of funding for infrastructure and service improvement has flowed to \nsome TMAs through vertical programs, mostly implemented by the provincial-level Public Health \nEngineering  Department  (PHED),  previously  a  wing  of  the  local  government  department. 11 \nHowever,  these  assets  have  not  improved  service  delivery  due  to  (i)  inappropriate  projects \nselection, (ii) inappropriate designs, and (iii) insufficient attention to operation and maintenance \nrequirements.  The  current  system,  whereby  the  PHED  constructs  infrastructure  to  be  handed \nover  to  and  maintained  by  the  TMAs,  incentivizes  scheme  construction  and  not  service \nprovision.  It  has  contributed  to  a  culture  of  disregard  for  customer  needs  and  disinterest  in \noperational  imperatives,  including  cost  measurement  and  recovery,  asset  inventorying,  and \nsystems mapping. There is, as a result, little transparency or accountability in service delivery.   \n \n10.  Weak  Financial  Management  and  Incentives  for  Cost  Recovery.  At  province  level, \npolicy  frameworks  are  not  well  established.  Lack  of  political  commitment  for  cost  recovery \nundermines  financial  sustainability.  Low  tariffs  and  poor  collection  efficiencies  for  urban \nservices,  in  turn,  reflect  the  poor  quality  of  service  offered  and  poor  financial  management  of \nservice  providers.  User  charges  must  be  increased  and  collection  efficiencies  improved  for \nsustainable services. However, increases must follow visible improvements in service quality.  \n\n                                                 \n7  A  taluka  is  a  unit  of  local  government  that  covers  several  towns  and  villages.  Karachi  is  the  only  so-called  \u201ccity \ndistrict\u201d  government  in  Sindh.  All  other  municipalities  are  organized  as  taluka  municipal  administrations  (TMAs) \nwithin  \u201ccommon  districts.\u201d  Under  the  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance,  these  TMAs  are  responsible  for \nmunicipal services and regulations. Municipal services include water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and drainage \nsystems.  \n\n8  Owing to their smaller size, none of the secondary towns in Sindh have water authorities or boards. \n9  A  review  of  TMA  staff  in  2007  found  that  over  90%  of  finance  officer  positions  (level  17)  were  either  vacant  or \nunderfilled with grade 11 accounts officers; some 40% of the infrastructure and services positions were vacant. The \nfifth budgeted position, the planning officer, has never been filled in any TMA owing to staffing constraints. \n10 Ironically, these schemes often sit alongside still functional infrastructure built decades or even a century ago.  \n11 In May 2008 the Public Health Engineering Wing was reorganized as a Department in Sindh Province. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n11. \nPublic  trust  in  service  providers  must  be  rebuilt.  Entire  towns,  such  as  Larkana  and \nShikarpur, have opted out of public piped-water supply systems development, preferring far less \nefficient,  but  more  reliable,  self-provision  from  household  pumping  schemes.  Cost  recovery \nagainst operations and maintenance for water supply varies (but is typically below 30%) and it is \nfar lower for wastewater management. The difference has to be made up through a government \nsubsidy.  The  exact  size  of  this  subsidy  is  difficult  to  determine,  given  the  absence  of  data  on \nwhat  it  costs  to  provide  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services.  Local  government \nofficials find it difficult to increase (or even to set) tariffs, and direct involvement of taluka nazims \nin  service  provision  inevitably  leads  to  undercharging. 12 There  is  neither  bulk  nor  individual \nmetering in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns. User fees are typically charged at a flat rate. There is no \ncalculation of tariff rates necessary to cover cash operating costs, operations, and maintenance, \nand eventually debt service, depreciation, and a share of future capital expenditure.  \n \nPoor  Planning  and  Weak  Appreciation  for  Urbanization  as  a  Force  for  Economic \n12. \nGrowth.  These  problems  are  compounded  by  the  inadequate  urban  planning  systems,  which \nhave  resulted  in  haphazard  and  unplanned  growth  in  town  areas.  While  urban  planning \nfunctions have been devolved to the TMAs, no planning staff has been assigned and TMAs are \nunable  to  generate  the  vision,  strategies,  plans,  and  associated  actions  to  stimulate  and \nmanage effective urban growth and thus support economic development and improved quality \nof life. At province level, there has been too little focus on the role of urbanization in supporting \neconomic  growth,  job  creation,  and  reduced  regional  disparities.  A  provincial  focal  point  for \nstrategizing and planning urban regeneration is needed. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nExternal  Assistance. ADB assistance to water supply and sanitation (WSS) and other \nurban development in Pakistan to date totals over $1.2 billion across 16 projects and about 30 \nTA  projects.  However,  this  program  will  be  the  first  major  assistance  for  secondary  towns  in \nSindh  Province  since  the  $22  million  loan  for  the  Hyderabad  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage \nProject13 approved  in  1976.  It  follows  other  ADB  support  for  WSS  and  the  urban  sector  in \nPunjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Karachi (generally implemented with mixed results). \nThe Investment Program complements ongoing and proposed support to Karachi and responds \nto a Government of Sindh (GOS) commitment to regionally balanced development. \n \n14. \nOther  development  partners  assisting  Pakistan\u2019s  urban  sector  include  the  World  Bank; \nthe  governments  of  Japan,  Kuwait,  Netherlands,  and  United  Kingdom;  United  Nations \norganizations; and the World Bank\u2019s multipartner Water and Sanitation Program (WSP). While \neach has tended to focus on particular cities or provinces, the Investment Program\u2019s design has \nbenefited  from  information-sharing  with  the  World  Bank,  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom initiatives in Punjab Province, and WSP initiatives in North-\nWest  Frontier  Province.  Within  Sindh,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  providing \nadvisory services and/or finance to improve water supply, sewerage, and transport, including a \nmaster plan for water supply and sewerage in Karachi. WSP has supported WSS reforms and \nbenchmarking,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  United \nNations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  have  province-wide  sanitation  programs  (although  focused \nthat  Work  Program  proposes \nprimarily  on  rural  communities),  and  USAID\u2019s  Districts \n\nPrior External Assistance and Lessons \n\n                                                 \n12 Taluka nazims (which are chief elected local officials) in North Sindh recognize this problem and want to distance \n\n13 ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  assessed  this  project  \u201cpartly  successful\u201d  after  significant  reductions  in \n\ntheir offices from direct provision. \n\nscope and protracted delays. \n\n \n\n\f5\n\n \n\n \n\ninfrastructure  support  for  select  TMAs  in  water  supply  and  sanitation. 14    Appendix  4  lists \ndevelopment partner assistance to the urban sector since 2000. \n\n15. \nLessons  Observed  and  Incorporated.  The  Investment  Program  design  takes  into \naccount  lessons  from  previous  ADB  loans,  other  donor  interventions,  and  the  Government\u2019s \nown  programs. 15 The  Operations  Evaluation  Department  has  assessed  ADB\u2019s  urban  sector \nlending  as  weak,  citing  limited  ability  to  \u201cturn  physical  outputs  into  outcomes.\u201d  Contributing \nfactors  cited  include  (i)  financial  and  management  weakness  of  urban  authorities;  (ii)  poor \nsequencing  of  infrastructure  and  institutional  reforms,  the  former  typically  preceding  the  latter; \n(iii)  insufficient  attention  to  distortions  from  rent-seeking  behavior;  and  (iv)  too  little  innovation \nand  private  sector  participation. 16 The  Investment  Program  design  directly  addresses  these \nissues by providing a given TMA a sound alternative to professionally manage urban services \ndelivery  through  a  jointly  held  company.  The  new  company  will  help  to  ring-fence  finances, \nmaintain  higher  standards  for  corporate  governance  and  transparency,  and  access  private \nsector  expertise.  Fully  consistent  with  these  lessons,  the  Investment  Program  goes  beyond \ninstitutional strengthening components to ensure the key institutional reform is in place upfront.   \n \n16. \nThe  Investment  Program  also  addresses  these  issues  by  (i)  adopting  a  phased \napproach  under  an  MFF,  allowing  time  for  reform  to  take  root  and  roll  out  to  new  areas;  (ii) \nputting  institutional  reforms  in  advance  of  infrastructure,  thus  better  aligning  incentives  to \nservice delivery results; (iii) targeting a small number of priority secondary towns, geographically \nclustered  and  agreed  to  collaborate  through  a  single  implementing  agency,  the  jointly  held \ncorporate utility; (iv) focusing on only two urban subsectors; (v) targeting quick wins through a \nfew tranche 1 demonstration subprojects; and (vi) avoiding the institutional imperative to be all \nthings to all people.17 Supplementary Appendix B elaborates on lessons learned. \n \nD. \n \nRationale  for  Investment  Program.  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities  are  under  increasing \n17. \nstress of population growth and continuing urban poverty. Provision of urban infrastructure and \nservices has not kept pace with this population growth. Inadequate planning and infrastructure \nservices  management  keep  costs  high  and  quality  low  while  impeding  these  towns\u2019  economic \ncompetitiveness.  Insufficient  and  unreliable  urban  services  (i)  add  to  business  and  household \ncosts, (ii) damage the urban environment and diminish the quality of life, and (iii) decrease the \nattractiveness of these cities to potential investment (thus contributing to a downward spiral of \ndevelopment). The poor performance of local governments in delivering services also reduces \ntheir credibility and adversely affects their ability to perform other municipal functions. \n \n18. \nThe devolution reforms of 2001 transferred political and administrative power to elected \nlocal authorities and provided an opportunity for more effective service provision. Nevertheless, \nservice  delivery  improvements  are  hindered  by  continuing  overlaps  and  fragmentation  of \n\nRationale \n\n                                                 \n14 Such  investment  supported  by  development  partners  poses  challenges  for  establishing  urban  services \ncorporations. These development partner-supported vertical programs also need to be brought under the planning \nand implementation umbrella of the service provider.    \n\n15 GOS has cited local government department review that found about 700 of over 1,000 Public Health Engineering-\nconstructed schemes to be inoperable, owing primarily to operations and maintenance problems or TMA refusal to \naccept the schemes.   \n\n16 ADB. 2005. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation for the Social Sectors in Pakistan. Manila. \n17 As an example, the imperative for hygiene education is clear. Evidence shows that hand washing with soap can \nreduce diarrhea risk by nearly 50%, and hygiene promotion may be the single most cost-effective means of \npreventing disease in developing countries. Rather than appending a hygiene education component and adding \nunnecessary complexity, the Investment Program will focus on service delivery but seek parallel financing with \npartners specializing in hygiene promotion in schools. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nresponsibilities  between  the  TMAs  and  provincial-level  agencies.  In  some  urban  areas,  local \ngovernment  management  has  been  weakened  since  devolution.  Alternative  approaches  to \nservice provision, including infrastructure planning and construction, are needed to address the \nchallenges  facing  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities.  Service  delivery  needs  to  be  separated  from \nsystem regulation and political interest. Service provision needs to be progressively placed on a \ncommercial  and  self-sustaining  basis,  leveraging  private  sector  expertise  and  incentive \nstructures as appropriate.   \n \n19. \nSCIP  is  a  10-year,  $400  million  program  under  a  $300  million  ADB-financed  MFF  to \nfinance  basic  urban  infrastructure  improvements  in  Sindh\u2019s  secondary  towns  through  (i) \nestablishment of local government-owned, professionally managed urban services corporations \n(USCs);  (ii)  support  for  urban  sector  reforms  and  capacity  development;  and  (iii)  priority \ninvestment  in  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  infrastructure.  The \nInvestment Program offers so-called \u201cclusters\u201d of local governments a new means to organize \nurban  services  delivery  by  drawing  on  a  provision  of  the  Sindh  Local  Government  Ordinance \nallowing  for  TMAs  to  jointly  establish  and  own  a  regional  utility  corporation.  This  collaborative \napproach targets geographically clustered TMAs and takes advantage of economies of scale by \naggregating  TMAs\u2019  shared  vision  for  improved  service  delivery.  Two  or  three  USCs,  to  be \ndeveloped sequentially under the Investment Program and incorporated under the Companies \nOrdinance  1984,  will  have  (i)  professional  management,  (ii)  more  efficient  administration  and \nsound financial management systems, (iii) sound corporate governance, (iv) commitment to cost \nrecovery,  (v)  enhanced  accountability,  and  (vi)  greater  customer  focus.  The  USCs  will  be \nsupported by various agreements and guidelines that clearly establish the roles, responsibilities, \nand  obligations  of  the  participating  TMAs,  the  USCs,  the  provincial  government,  and  other \nstakeholders. A financing mechanism will be established to fund cash shortfalls arising from the \ngap between costs to deliver urban services and what citizens will pay for these services. Over \ntime,  this  gap  should  narrow  as  services  improve,  trust  builds,  and  operating  efficiencies \nincrease.   \n \n20. \ntargets  significant \nimprovements in service delivery, beginning with demonstration areas aimed at restoring trust in \npiped-water  services  with  24/7  delivery  of  potable  water.  Across  participating  towns,  better \nservice providers should bring significantly improved quality and quantity of piped-water access, \nfar higher levels of wastewater treatment, and systematic collection and proper final disposal of \nsolid waste to break the cycle of trash that clogs drains and leads to flooded communities. The \npresent state of operations and service data makes setting service standards and performance \ntargets  difficult.  However,  under  the  Investment  Program,  generating  baseline  data  and \nmapping  existing  systems  will  be  a  priority  to  enable  optimum  investment  and  informed \noperational  decisions.  As  information  becomes  available,  performance  targets  will  be  agreed \nbetween the USCs and TMAs, documented in service agreements, linked to tariff and financing \nfor \nrequirements,  and  monitored \naccountability, transparency, and financial efficiency are expected, and nonperformance in this \nregard will be defined as failure. \n \nSelection  of  MFF  Modality.  The  MFF  modality  was  selected,  as  it  sets  a  solid \n21. \nfoundation  for  long-term  partnership  between  ADB  and  GOS  to  revitalize  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier \ncities.  The  modality  is  well  suited  to  the  Investment  Program  as  it  avoids  the  piecemeal \napproach of past urban sector projects and establishes a sufficiently broad platform to engage \nsubstantively  with  GOS  on  fundamental  reforms.  It  allows  for  (i)  logical  sequencing  of \ninterrelated physical, and nonphysical investments over a 10-year period to support GOS\u2019 long-\nterm objectives for balanced urban development; (ii) sequencing of significant public sector and \nurban  service  reform  initiatives  that  require  actions  over  a  period  of  years;  (iii)  phasing  of \n\nthrough  benchmarking  exercises.  Higher  standards \n\nInvestment  Program \n\ninstitutional  reforms, \n\nThrough \n\nthese \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\ninvestments to support subprojects in new \u201ctown clusters\u201d as they organize USCs; (iv) flexibility \nin  levels  of  investment,  with  tranche  amounts  increasing  over  time  as  reforms  take  hold,  the \ncorporate  model  is  adopted,  and  geographical  coverage  increases;  (v)  flexibility  in  timing  of \nreforms against a road map for priority policy actions while ensuring the pace of infrastructure \ninvestment  incentivizes  institutional  change;  (vi)  testing  of  new  ideas  and  application  of  this \nexperience  to  other  town  clusters  during  subsequent  phases,  thus  enhancing  implementation \nefficiency;  (vii)  expedited  implementation  should  reforms  and  loan  disbursements  proceed \nahead  of  plan;  and  (viii)  financing  on  an  as-needed  basis  to  reduce  transaction  costs.  Finally, \nthe  MMF  modality  also  complements  ADB\u2019s  proposed  investment  support  to  Karachi,  thus \nproviding a more balanced approach to province-wide urban development in Sindh. \n \n22. \nSector Road Map and Investment Program. A set of institutional and financial reform \nactions, sequenced with targeted consultancy and priority subproject investments, are required \nfor this step-change in urban strategy and planning at provincial level and in services delivery at \nlocal level (Appendix 3). Under the Investment Program, GOS has agreed with ADB on a road \nmap  of  practical,  well-sequenced  steps  to  bring  about  institutional,  operational,  financial,  and \nregulatory  reforms  and  service  orientation  reforms  to  ensure  a  receptive  environment  for \ninfrastructure investment.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe impact of the Investment Program will be improved health and quality of life for an \nestimated  4,000,000  residents  in  the  participating  secondary18 towns  in  Sindh  and  improved \neconomic  competitiveness  of  those  towns.  The  outcome  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nenhanced quality, coverage, and reliability of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services for \nan estimated 570,000 households in the participating towns. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nfour  parts.  Part  A  supports \n\nInvestment  Program  comprises \n\n24. \nTo  achieve  these  outcomes,  the  Investment  Program  will  support  a  comprehensive \nreform  program  that  includes  introducing  more  effective  urban  planning,  well  managed  and \nfinancially sustainable urban service providers, and increased private sector participation. These \nreforms  will  be  complemented  by  priority  investments  in  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM \nimprovements.  The \nthe \nestablishment  of  professionalized  urban  service  providers,  urban  planning  capacity,  and \ntechnical  backstopping  for  program  implementation.  Parts  B  and  C  will  finance  targeted \ninfrastructure improvements in water supply and wastewater and in SWM, respectively. Part D \nprovides  revenue  shortfall  support  for  the  newly  established  USCs.  Parts  B,  C,  and  D  are \ndesigned to complement the institutional development and reforms aimed at improving service \ndelivery. Appendix 5 details these physical and non-physical outputs planned under Tranche 1. \n \n25. \nThe core reform under the Investment Program is the delegated management of water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  to  professional  management  under  contractual \nagreements.  Starting  in  northern  Sindh,  the  Investment  Program  will  support  formation  and \noperationalization of USCs (each jointly established under the Companies Ordinance 1984 by a \ncluster  of  TMAs)  to  deliver  these  services  to  specified  coverage  areas  comprising  the  former \nurban  local  council  areas.  Service  provision  will  be  delegated  to  three  USCs  by  clusters  of \nTMAs  through  service  and  asset  management  agreements  (SAMAs)  that  clearly  define \n\n                                                 \n18 Secondary towns for purposes of the Investment Program refers to those towns with populations between 50,000 \n\nand 1 million.   \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nrespective  roles  and  responsibilities  while  specifying  service  targets,  standards,  and  agreed \ninvestment and service charge levels. The USCs will be accountable to their respective boards \n(which  will  include  some  TMA  representatives)  for  their  performance  as  autonomous  entities \nwith a focus on performance and customer service. NSUSC has been incorporated to serve the \nfirst  cluster  of  six  TMAs  comprising  Khairpur,  Larkana,  New  Sukkur,  Rohri,  Shikarpur,  and \nSukkur.19 Associated  service  agreements  have  been  drafted  and  are  under  negotiation.  The \nInvestment Program will support these actions and arrangements in NSUSC and future USCs, \nincluding to engage the necessary management expertise. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart  A:  Urban  Planning  on  Institutional  Development,  and  Program \nImplementation Support    \n\n26. \nPart A will provide technical and management support to the program support unit (PSU) \nand  the  urban  policy  and  strategic  planning  unit  (the  urban  unit),  two  separate  but \ncomplementary units in the Sindh Planning and Development Department (P&DD). The PSU is \ntasked  with  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  execution  and  specific  reform  activities.  The  urban  unit \nwill provide overall guidance on urban policy and planning plus province-wide reforms to support \nmore effective urbanization. Part A will provide support to the PSU for (i) executing the reform \nagenda under the program, including rolling out the regional USC concept to other city clusters; \n(ii)  subproject  appraisal  and  support  on  safeguards;  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluating  the \nInvestment  Program.  Support  will  be  provided  under  part  A  to  the  urban  unit  for  urban  policy, \nstrategic regional and town planning, and information systems. As a focal point for SCIP-related \nreforms,  the  PSU  will  support  the  TMAs  in  adjusting  to  their  new  role  as  shareholders  of  the \nUSCs  and  parties  to  the  SAMAs.  Through  the  PSU  and  urban  unit,  the  SCIP  will  support  the \nTMAs to monitor USCs and develop town planning capacity. \n \n27. \nTechnical  and  management  support  will  be  provided  to  the  USCs  in  planning, \noperational  systems,  investment  programming  and  budgeting,  and  system  operation  and \nmaintenance.  This  will  include  developing  business  plans  to  set  out  how  the  USCs  will  meet \ntheir  obligations  under  the  SAMAs  and  to  be  used  as  a  basis  for  the  release  of  Investment \nProgram funds. Consultancy support will also be provided to the USCs and their capital works \nunits for the Investment Program\u2019s implementation, including design and such contract-related \nmatters  as  document  preparation,  procurement  packaging,  tendering,  awarding,  and  contract \nsupervision.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  the  USCs  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation \nthrough performance-based management contracts for water and waste management services.  \nPart A will also include (i) provision of computers, office equipment, and vehicles for the PSU, \nurban  unit,  and  USCs  to  support  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  execution  and  subsequent \noperations;  and  (ii)  training  for  the  PSU,  urban  unit,  TMAs,  and  USCs  in  a  range  of \nadministrative, management, and technical aspects of strategic planning, service planning, and \noperations.  \n \nTranche  1  and  Subsequent  Tranches.    Part  A  financing  for  non-physical  outputs  \n28. \nunder tranche 1 focuses on the operationalization of the PSU and NSUSC, establishment of the \nurban  unit,  and  building  a  strong  platform  from  which  to  implement  the  reform  program  and \ninfrastructure works.  Under subsequent tranches, part A financing will continue to support the \nPSU,  urban  unit  and  USCs,  with  more  emphasis  on  capacity  development  for  the  new  USCs.  \nInvestment  in  capacity  development  at  provincial  and  USC  levels  under  the  early  tranches \nshould enable the proportion of financing under part A to reduce overtime. \n\n                                                 \n19 Factors influencing the selection of urban areas in these TMAs included population (Sukkur and Larkana are the \nthird  and  fourth  largest  towns  in  Sindh),  proximity  to  one  another  (all  within  90-minute  drive),  strategic  location \nalong the National Trade Corridor, receptive political leadership, and willingness to cooperate together and improve \nurban service delivery systems. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nPart B: Water Supply and Wastewater Management Improvements \n \n\n2. \n \n29. \nPart B will be implemented by the USCs and focuses on water supply and wastewater \nmanagement,  including  system  mapping  and  planning;  source  identification,  development, \nimprovement,  and  augmentation;  raw  water  transmission,  storage,  and  treatment;  treatment \nplant  rehabilitation;  treated  water  storage,  transmission,  and  distribution;  distribution  network \nand  service  connection  improvement;  leak  detection  and  reduction;  bulk  and  individual  water \nmetering;  water  quality  monitoring;  drainage  and  sewerage  network  improvements;  and \nwastewater treatment plant rehabilitation and construction.  \n \n30. \nTranche  1.  Under  the  first  tranche,  part  B  finances  physical  investments  in  (i)  water \nsupply  system  augmentation  and  rehabilitation  (source  development,  treatment,  storage,  and \ntransmission)  in  the  TMAs  of  Khairpur,  New  Sukkur,  Rohri,  and  Sukkur;  (ii)  pilot  distribution \nnetwork improvement (DNI) schemes in specific urban council areas in Khairpur, New Sukkur, \nRohri,  and  Sukkur;  (iii)  groundwater  monitoring  in  Larkana  and  Shikarpur;  (iv)  urgent \nimprovements to wastewater management systems in Khairpur and Rohri; and (v) small-scale \ninvestments in drainage and sewerage networks and associated facilities through an allocation \nof loan funds for wastewater improvement works in tranche 1 cluster towns, subject to selection \ncriteria in the FFA. \n \n31. \nSubsequent Tranches 2\u20135. Under the subsequent tranches, part B will finance physical \ninvestments  in  similar  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  including  more  comprehensive \ninvestment in wastewater works. Subsequent investments will be guided by further mapping and \nplanning work under tranche 1.  Tranche 2 investments will focus on expanding investment and \nconsolidating reforms in northern Sindh towns, before shifting to new town clusters and USCs \nunder  tranches  3\u20135.    Nawabshah  and  Mirpurkhas  are  the  most  likely  anchor  towns  for  future \ntown clusters in mid and south Sindh. \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Solid Waste Management Improvements  \n\n32. \nPart C will also be implemented by USCs and focuses on SWM, including investments in \nprimary  and  secondary  storage  and  collection,  waste  reduction,  recycling,  reuse  and  recovery \n(including incineration where appropriate), treatment, and final sanitary disposal.  \n \n33. \nTranche  1.    Under  the  first  tranche,  part  C  finances  physical  investments  in  (i) \nconstruction of four landfill facilities in Khairpur, Larkana, and Shikarpur, with a common facility \nin  Rohri  serving  New  Sukkur,  Rohri,  and  Sukkur;  (ii)  procurement  of  specialized  solid  waste \ncollection  and  disposal  equipment;  and  (iii)  provision  of  improved  communal  bins  for  waste \nstorage.  \n \nSubsequent Tranches 2\u20135.  Under the subsequent tranches, part C will finance similar \n34. \ninvestments  in  collection,  final  disposal  and  management  of  solid  waste.    During  the  second \ntranche,  NSUSC  will  expand  its  coverage  to  other  north  Sindh  towns,  with  investment  in \nadditional sanitary landfills and collection systems. Subsequent tranches will build on the results \nof tranche 1, particularly the introduction of private sector participation in SWM.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPart D: Operational and Transition Support Funding  \n\nPart D provides financing for (i) operational support funding intended to bridge the short-\n35. \nto-medium term operational cash shortfalls of the USCs with GOS grant funds, and (ii) transition \nsupport funding to bridge the short-term operational cash shortfalls of the USCs with GOS loan \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nfunds.  The  choice  of  mix  between  grant  and  loan  funding  for  the  USCs  will  be  at  GOS\u2019 \ndiscretion.20  \n \n36. \nTranche  1  and  Subsequent  Tranches.    The  estimated  financing  requirement  under \npart  D  in  tranche  1  is  $8  million.    Financing  under  tranche  2  and  subsequent  tranches  will \ncontinue for NSUSC through FY2017, but in decreasing amounts.  Funding under part D will be \navailable  for  new  USCs,  subject  to  the  criteria  and  agreed  operational  funding  guidelines. \nFunding of about $30 million from part D may be required for operational support of three USCs \nover the Investment Program period. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n37. \nEstablishment  of  Regional  Urban  Services  Corporations.  The  Investment  Program \nproposes a progressive, two-stage reform process for improving municipal services and taking \nadvantage  of  economies  of  scale.  As  a  first  step,  the  participating,  geographically  clustered \nTMAs would join together to form a corporatized operating utility, a USC, under the Companies \nOrdinance 1984. The USC will aggregate the TMAs\u2019 urban water supply, wastewater, and SWM \noperations into a single corporation to achieve economies of scale and to share the overhead \ncosts  of  professional  management.21 Professional  management  will  be  competitively  recruited \nfrom  the  market  and  tasked  to  improve  service  delivery.  Incentives  will  be  better  aligned  with \nperformance  objectives,  and  compensation  systems  will  be  designed  to  reward  results.  USC \nfinances will be ring-fenced, rigorously audited, and not intermixed with TMA financial accounts, \nthus allowing management to better track service delivery costs and revenues. Under the USC \nmodel,  the  disconnect  between  asset  creation  and  asset  management  will  be  addressed,  as \nexisting system components will be inventoried and their performance assessed before deciding \non where, how much, and when to invest. This institutional reform will help to break the costly \ncycle of asset creation and rapid deterioration. Properly corporatized utilities, governed under an \nindependent board of directors and able to act in accordance with sound commercial principles, \nshould  ensure  focus  on  cost  recovery  to  achieve  financial  sustainability,  particularly  in  water \nsupply. Supplementary Appendix C elaborates on NSUSC organization and legal structure. \n \n38. \nService  and  Asset  Management  Agreements.  The  introduction  of  SAMAs  between \nTMAs and the USCs is at the core of the Investment Program\u2019s institutional reforms. The USCs \nwill  enter  into  SAMAs  with  each  of  their  participating  TMAs  to  provide  water,  wastewater,  and \nSWM  services  and  manage  the  relevant  TMA  assets  in  their  specified  urban  areas.22 These \npublic-public  service  agreements  would  set  out  performance \nindicators  and  reporting \nrequirements, as appropriate given systems data available. Such agreements would help clarify \nroles  and  responsibilities  during  the  first  stage  of  reform  and  improve  services  by  focusing \nmanagement  and  current  expenditure  on  readily  achievable  improvements  to  operations  and \nmaintenance.  These  SAMAs  will  provide  the  USCs  the  right  to  use  all  assets\u2014infrastructure, \nassociated  land,  and  mobile  plant  and  equipment\u2014as  required  to  deliver  the  contracted \nservices.23 These  agreements  represent  a  first  step  toward  better  incentivized,  performance-\nbased  management  contracting  agreements  that  assume  greater  private  sector  involvement \nunder  second-stage  reforms.  They  are  the  connective  tissue  that  links  the  various  elements \nnecessary for improved service delivery. The SAMAs represent the vehicle by which the USC \nand  TMAs  agree  on  a  coherent  plan  for  desired  operating  results  that  is  linked  to  identified \n\n                                                 \n20 The appropriate timing and use of loan funding will depend upon urban services\u2019 revenue generating capacity and \n\ntheir potential to generate surplus funds for debt repayment. \n\n21 This refers to operations in former urban local councils. \n22 Coverage  areas  will  be  former  urban  local  councils.  Rural  or  village-based  water  and  sanitation  programs  will \n\nremain under their current management arrangements by TMA staff not deputed to the USCs. \n\n23 The TMAs will remain the owners of new and existing assets in water supply, wastewater, and SWM.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\noperating priorities, levels of capital investment, operating budget, and, most important, agreed \nincreases in user charges.  Supplementary Appendix D contains a draft SAMA. \n \n39. \nfunding \nOperational  and  Transition  Support  Funding  Mechanisms.  These \nmechanisms  aim  to  bridge  the  gap  between  operational  costs  and  operational  revenues  in  a \nmanner that encourages financial transparency, operational accountability, and fiscal discipline. \nThe  mechanisms  will  help  GOS  clearly  to  identify,  measure,  and,  over  time,  reduce  the  fiscal \nburden  of  supporting  municipal  services  delivery.  Operational  support  funding  is  intended  to \nbridge  the  operational  cash  shortfalls  of  USC  operations  with  grant  funds  when  user  charges \nare unlikely to be sufficient to repay the funding, as typically is the case of wastewater and SWM \nservices. Transition support funding aims to bridge USCs\u2019 short-term operational cash shortfalls \nwith  loan  funds,  subsequently  to  be  repaid  through  USCs\u2019  revenues  from  user  charges. 24 \nOperational support funding will be linked to understandings between the TMAs and the USCs \non  tariff  enhancement.25 The  two  funding  mechanisms  will  provide  GOS  a  flexible  option  to \nensure that the investments made through the Investment Program are financially sustainable. \nThis will help USCs to realize the full economic life of their infrastructure, delaying the need for \nasset replacement. At GOS level, the operational support funding will be channeled through an \nescrow  account  arrangement,  guided  by  an  escrow  agreement,  and  overseen  by  an \nindependent verifier26 to ensure timely, predictable, and accountable funding to the USCs. The \nguidelines for the operational and transition support funding are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n40. \nStage-Two  Reforms  and  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  through  Management \nContracts. First-stage reforms will establish the USCs with more professional management and \naccess to skilled staff. It will be a substantial improvement over the typical water and sanitation \nauthority  model  and  will  begin  service  improvement.  Over  time,  however,  there  will  likely  be \nincreased  pressure  to  reduce  USC  autonomy  (e.g.,  pressure  to  hire  unqualified  staff  or  not  to \ncollect  user  charges).  This  suggests \nin  service  delivery  under  a \ncorporatization  model,  in  some  contexts,  may  only  be  modest  and  not  sustainable  without \nfurther reforms to better align incentives with service delivery. Performance-based management \ncontracts or lease affermage arrangements with qualified private operators are ways to further \nincentivize  results.  Establishment  of  USCs  and  further  advisory  support  on  private  sector \nparticipation  under  the  Investment  Program  will  help  pave  the  way  for  second-stage  reforms, \nincluding  introduction  of  more  comprehensive  performance-based  management  contracts  in \nSWM  and  water  services  and  appropriate  systems  for  regulation.  Such  performance-based \ncontracts will further separate TMAs from day-to-day service provision. This will allow local and \nprovincial  governments  to  shift  their  focus  to  regulatory  and  monitoring  functions  while  private \noperators focus on professional management of water and solid waste operations, including to \nrecover user charges and deliver results against contracted targets.  \n \nD. \n \n41. \nSector  investment  needs  are  estimated  at  $2.3  billion  through  2030.  The  medium-term \nestimate is at $1.0 billion through 2018, of which the Investment Program provides $400 million \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nimprovements \n\nthat \n\n                                                 \n24 GOS had indicated a preference to provide USCs grant financing at the start. Transition support funding provides \nGOS an option that it may avail itself of as tariff revenues, particularly for water supply, increase to levels that can \nsupport debt repayment. \n\n25 Such  understandings  will  be  included  in  SAMAs,  with  principles  being  (i)  tariffs  should  increase  with  inflation,  (ii) \ntariff  increases  above  the  rate  of  inflation  should  be  linked  to  improved  services,  and  (iii)  average  tariffs  should \nincrease  over  time  to  levels  that  cover  the  full  costs  of  operations  and  maintenance.  A  Tripartite  Operational \nSupport  and  Capital  Investment  Financing  Agreement  among  GOS,  the  USC,  and  each  TMA  will  guide  funding \noperations and complement the SAMAs. This will be a grant agreement under tranche 1. \n\n26 The independent verifier will be a firm contracted by GOS under part A against agreed criteria.   \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nequivalent  (Table  1).

The financing plan for the Investment Program is in Table 2. \n \n43. \nThe  Government  has  also  requested  ADB  to  consider  providing  up  to  $112  million \nequivalent  from  its  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  for  subsequent  tranches.  It  is \nunderstood that any additional ADF financing will be accompanied by a corresponding reduction \nin the OCR financing available, so that in any event the total available amount under the MFF \nwill  not  exceed  $300  million  equivalent.  This  additional  allocation  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the \ngeneral  availability  of  ADF  resources,  (ii)  Pakistan\u2019s  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to \nADB\u2019s  Graduation  Policy  (1998)  and  the  requirements  of  the  ADF  donors,  and  (iii)  the \navailability  of  such  resources  to  Pakistan  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Performance-Based \nAllocation for Asian Development Fund Resources (2001). \n \n44. \nThe  MFF  will  consist  of  individual  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  subprojects  and \ncomponents  under  the  Investment  Program,  subject  to  the  Government\u2019s  submitting  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  and  execution  of  the  related  loan  and  project  agreements. \nThe Government and GOS has entered into a framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB \nand  are  required  to  comply  with  its  requirements.  Pursuant  to  the  FFA,  the  Government  has \nsubmitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  in  a  total  amount  of  $38  million  equivalent  from  ADF.  The \nminimum amount of subsequent PFRs will be $25 million. \n \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility.

All  provisions  of  ordinary  loan  regulations \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan, \nsubject  to modifications,  if  any,  that  may  be  included  under  any  loan  and  project agreements. \nEach loan will be for a 24-year term, including a grace period of 4 years, with an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per annum, as well as such other terms and conditions as agreed in the FFA and loan \nregulations  and  further  supplemented  in  the  legal  agreements.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The Government will relend the proceeds \nof such loans to GOS on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loans.  \n \nParts A and D; selected water supply, wastewater management, and SWM subprojects \n46. \nunder  parts  B  and  C;  and  project  design  and  supervision  under  all  investment  subprojects, \namounting to up to $38 million in tranche 1, will be eligible for funding through ADF resources.28 \nIn  the  event  that  ADB  will  provide  additional  ADF  financing  as  described  in  para.  43,  such \nadditional ADF resources will only be used for eligible expenditures. The Government will make \nthe  proceeds  of  the  loan  available  to  GOS  upon  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nExcept as ADB may otherwise agree, the terms and conditions will include interest at the rate of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a repayment period of \n32 years, and a grace period of 8 years. GOS will bear the foreign exchange risk of the OCR \nand ADF loans.

Progress  toward  the  expected  outcomes  and  set  out  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework and the action plan for reform will be part of the decision-making criteria \nand filters for continuing ADB support. Compliance with the safeguards requirements and social \ndevelopment policies, as well as with all other undertakings set forth in the FFA will also guide \nADB\u2019s decision to continue financing under individual tranches. \n \nF. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Program Management \n\n48. \nP&DD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA).  GOS  has  established  a  PSU  to  support \nimplementation  and  take  overall  responsibility  for  the  Investment  Program  including  to  (i) \n                                                 \n28 Subprojects  with  priority  to  be  financed  by  ADF  resources  include  (i)  under  part  B,  pilot  distribution  network \nimprovements  for  water  supply  in  priority  zones  and  wastewater  improvements;  and  (ii)  under  part  C, \nimprovements in primary and secondary solid waste collection and storage.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\npromote urban and related sector reforms as agreed in the urban sector road map and design \nand  monitoring  framework;  (ii)  support  rollout  of  the  USC  model  to  new  town  clusters;  (iii) \nassume  responsibility  for  the  preparation  of  the  PFR;  (iv)  facilitate  interdepartmental  and \nprovincial coordination; (v) carry out program monitoring and evaluation through the investment \nprogram  performance  monitoring  system  (IPPMS);  (vi)  prepare  quarterly  and  annual  progress \nreports; (vii) ensure the quality of social and environmental safeguards documentation prepared \nby  the  implementing  agencies;  and  (viii)  engage  an  independent  verifier29 to  assess  USC  and \nTMA  compliance  with  Investment  Program-related  agreements.  P&DD  will  also  establish  an \nurban unit within 6 months of the effectiveness of the first tranche. The urban unit will provide \nstrategic  urban  planning  and  policy  support  for  urban  development  in  Sindh.  In  the  context  of \nthe  Investment  Program,  the  PSU  and  urban  unit  will  work  together  as  change  managers, \nsupporting  rollout  of  the  USC  model  to  new  town  clusters.  Implementation  arrangements  are \ndiagrammed  in  Appendix  7.  The  design  of  program  management,  capacity  building,  and \nimplementation support is described in Appendix 8. The EA will establish one or more regional \noffices as needed to support Investment Program implementation and facilitate TMA interaction \nwith the USCs. \n \nThe  SCIP\u2019s  program  director,  the  PSU  head,30 and  the  head  of  the  urban  unit  will  be \n49. \nrecruited  by  P&DD  through  competitive  processes  acceptable  to  ADB  and  criteria  mutually \nagreed  between  GOS  and  ADB.  The  urban  unit  head  recruitment  process  will  be  open  to \ngovernment and market applicants. The PSU and urban unit heads will be supported by highly \nqualified  professional  and  support  staff  recruited  through  competitive  processes  acceptable  to \nADB, and against criteria mutually agreed between Sindh and ADB.31 The PSU staff will include \nspecialists  in  municipal  services  engineering,  municipal  finance,  program  implementation, \nprocurement,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  urban  development,  and  information  technology.  The \nurban  unit  staff  will  include  specialists  in  urban  policy  and  economics,  regional  and  urban \nplanning, statistics and mapping, and information technology. The SCIP program director will be \nresponsible  to  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  implementation  is  consistent  with  its \nenvironmental and social safeguards frameworks.  \n \n50. \nThe PSC will provide policy direction and strategic oversight and serve as a focal point \nfor  interagency  coordination  on  Investment  Program-related  matters.  PSU  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  provincial  government,  district  government,  participating  TMAs  and  from \ncivil society. The chairperson may invite other persons, as necessary, to attend PSC meetings. \nThe PSC will meet at least quarterly. The PSC will, among other responsibilities, (i) advise on \nkey  sector  reform  milestones,  (ii)  review  annual  and  quarterly  performance  reports  on  reform \nand implementation progress of the Investment Program, and (iii) advise on or make policy-level \ndecisions required to facilitate timely program execution.  \n \n51. \nThe  EA  will  also  facilitate  establishment  of  the  USCs  to  be  incorporated  under  the \nCompanies Ordinance 1984, with all participating TMAs as shareholders comprising the general \nbody  of  the  corporation.32 Each  USC  will  have  a  board  of  directors  which  will  include  (i)  the \ntaluka  nazims  of  the  TMAs  forming  the  shareholders  of  the  corporation;  (ii)  provincial \ngovernment  representation  comprising  the  SCIP  program  director;  a  representative  from  the \nprovincial finance department; and district coordination officers; (iii) the managing director of the \n                                                 \n29 Findings of the independent verifier  will be provided simultaneously to GOS, NSUSC, and ADB, and they  will be \n\n30 The existing PSU head, the SCIP program director, was selected through such a competitive process. Successors, \n\nmade public on the NSUSC website. \n\nif any, will be similarly recruited. \n\n31 The  staff  for  each  unit  will  comprise  five  full-time  specialists  under  loan  financing,  and  three  to  four  incremental \n\n32 Each  USC  will  be  established  prior  to  loan  negotiations  for  any  tranche  intended  to  finance  its  operations  or \n\nstaff from GOS. \n\ninvestments. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nUSC; and (iv) at least 35% of the total Board members will be independent directors, selected \nagainst agreed skills-based criteria and in accordance with a process acceptable to ADB. The \nindependent  directors  will  include  representatives  from  the  business  community,  and  at  least \none  third  will  be  women.33 The  managing  director  of  the  USC  will  have  experience  managing \nservice  delivery  and  other  relevant  qualifications  to  be  agreed  upon  between  ADB,  and  GOS. \nThe USC managing director will be recruited from the open market and on a competitive basis \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n52. \nThe USC will be responsible for the day-to-day management of urban services provision, \nincluding  on-the-job  training  of  deputed  TMA  staff  in  utility  operations,  and  will  implement  all \nwater  supply,  sanitation,  and  SWM  construction  and  rehabilitation  work,  including  the \nsubprojects,  in  the  coverage  areas.  The  USC  will  also  (i)  be  responsible  for  the  procurement \nprocess,  including  the  award  and  implementation  of  contracts  related  to  water  supply, \nsanitation,  and  SWM  subprojects;  (ii)  prepare  annual  plans  and  budgets  for  submission  to  its \nboard; (iii) provide immediate oversight for environmental and social safeguards related to the \nsubprojects;  and  (iv)  prepare  periodic  financing  requests  with  respect  to  the  relevant \nsubprojects.   \n \n53. \nP&DD,  through  the  PSU,  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program\u2019s  support  for  spatial  and  town  planning  and  capacity  building  for \nparticipating TMAs while working in close collaboration with the regional office(s) at TMA-level, \nthe local government department, and the urban unit. \n \n54. \nP&DD will be responsible for establishing the operational and transition support funding \nmechanisms.  These  funds  will  be  operated  as  separate  escrow  accounts  in  which  ADB  loan \nproceeds  and  GOS  contributions  will  be  deposited  in  advance  for  each  financial  year.  Since \nthese  funds  will  support  the  operational  deficits  of  the  USCs,  GOS  will  release  the  monies \nbased  on  monthly  invoices  issued  by  USCs,  duly  examined  by  the  independent  verifier,  and \nrecommended to the GOS for payment.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation, Appraisal, and Approval \n\n \nCluster  Formation  and  Subproject  Selection  and  Preparation.  The  road  map \n55. \nprepared  for  the  urban  sector  in  Sindh,  along  with  the  prioritization  of  investments  within  this \nroad map, forms the basis for inclusion of infrastructure subprojects under parts B and C of the \nInvestment Program. While the type of subprojects likely to be included under the second and \nsubsequent  tranches  of  the  Investment  Program  have  been  identified  in  program  formulation, \nthe  beneficiary  city  clusters  and  exact  nature  of  subprojects  have  yet  to  be  determined. \nImplementation  priorities  may  need  to  be  adjusted  to  meet  changing  development  challenges. \nThe PSU, in collaboration with the urban unit, will be responsible for assisting in further cluster \nformation (Box 1). The NSUSC and subsequent USCs will be responsible for the identification \nand preparation of subprojects proposed for funding in the second and subsequent tranches, in \naccordance with the provisions of the urban sector road map, Investment Program  objectives, \nand good engineering practice.34 Cluster formation and all the subprojects proposed for funding \nunder the second and subsequent tranches must meet the subproject selection criteria set out \nin Schedule 4 to the FFA and adhere to environmental criteria presented in the environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  and  relevant  safeguards.  ADB  will  also  review  additional \n\n                                                 \n33 The  skills-based  selection  criteria  for  the  six  independent  directors  will  seek  inclusion  of  qualified  women  for  at \n\nleast one third of the six independent directors positions. \n\n34 Three likely clusters are Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, and Sukkur.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nBox 1: Selection Criteria for Town Clusters\n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  rolled-out  to  additional  clusters  of  towns  in  phased  and  strategic  manner, \ntiming  investment  with  introduction  of  management  capacity  to  deliver  services.  New  clusters  considered  for \ninfrastructure financing will meet the following criteria: \n \n\nThe cluster will have an anchor town, together providing a critical mass for efficient operation of an \nUrban Services Corporation. \nThe cluster\u2019s anchor town will be strategically located near transport links, and, owing to proximity to \nnatural and industrial resources, have capacity to generate economic growth and jobs. \nCluster  towns  will  have  jointly  incorporated  into  urban  services  corporation  under  the  Companies \nOrdinance 1984. \nCluster  towns  will  have  agreed  to  a  package  of  institutional  reforms  aimed  at  the  effective  and \nefficient management of urban services.  \n\nsubprojects  identified  for  funding  under  the  second  and  subsequent  tranches  to  ensure  their \ncompliance with the provisions of the FFA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n56. \nSubproject  Appraisal  and  Approval  and  Submission  of  PFRs.  The  PSU  will  be \nresponsible  for  detailed  appraisal  of  the  subprojects  with  the  assistance  of  the  program \nmanagement consultants. The PSU will prepare a summary subproject appraisal report based \non the feasibility studies carried out by the NSUSC and subsequent USCs with the assistance of \ntheir  respective  staff  and  consultants.  Feasibility  studies  will  include  the  rationale  for  each \nsubproject,  the  scope  of  work,  a  technical  description  and  analysis,  the  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing  plan,  an  environmental  assessment,  a  resettlement  plan,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  plan  (as  necessary),  and  the  implementation  arrangements  along  with  financial, \neconomic,  and  institutional  analyses.  All  summary  subproject  appraisal  reports  will  be  sent  to \nADB  for  review  and  approval  in  a  format  agreed  by  GOS  and  ADB.  If  necessary,  ADB  may \nadvise the EA to modify the subproject appraisal reports. Following ADB approval, and subject \nto any modifications and measures required by ADB, GOS will prepare PFRs for ADB financing. \nPFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing through the Government. \n \n\n\u201cAnchor towns\u201d are defined as contiguous urban areas having urban population in excess of 150,000.  Other \ntowns within 150 km of the anchor town, having urban populations in excess of 50,000, may join the cluster.  For \ninclusion in the program, the cluster should include an aggregate urban population of more than 350,000.  Neither \nKarachi nor Hyderabad is eligible. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule and Period \n\nThe  overall  implementation  period  for  the  Investment  Program  is  10  years,  through  30 \n57. \nJune  2018.  The  Investment  Program  constitutes  an  essential  component  of  the  overall \ninvestment  plan  for  the  sector that is  set  out  in  the  urban sector  road map.  Implementation  of \nsubprojects  is  proposed  in  five  tranches  over  the  implementation  period.  The  first  tranche \ncomprises  eight  subprojects.  The  subprojects  included  under  the  first  tranche  have  been \nselected on the basis of their relative priority under the Investment Program, their readiness for \nimplementation,  and  their  representative  character  in  the  context  of  the  overall  Investment \nProgram. It is anticipated that the first tranche will be implemented between January 2009 and \nJune  2012.  Approval  of  the  second  and  subsequent  tranches  will  depend  on  (i)  their  state  of \nreadiness, and (ii) GOS\u2019 compliance with the reform milestones set out in the reform action plan. \nThe implementation schedule for the MFF is in Appendix 9. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n58. \nProcurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  MFF  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nInternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedure  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts \nestimated to cost $5 million or more. Civil works contracts estimated to cost less than $5 million \nwill be procured under national competitive bidding (NCB).35 Single-stage two-envelope bidding \nprocedure with post-qualification will be adopted for all ICB and NCB civil works contracts under \nthe  Investment  Program.  ADB  has  reviewed  Pakistan\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  and \nprocurement  procedures  that  are  used  for  NCB  (civil  works  and  goods)  and  found  them  to  be \nconsistent with ADB requirements. Water supply and wastewater contracts that may involve civil \nworks combined with supply and installation of equipment and goods will be considered as civil \nworks  contracts,  regardless  of  the  proportion  of  costs  associated  with  equipment  or  goods. \nAppendix 10 contains a procurement plan for the first tranche, and the figure below highlights \nNSUSC\u2019s main contract packages under the first tranche. \n \n59. \nICB procedures will be used to procure goods and services estimated to cost $1,000,000 \nor more. NCB procedures will be followed for procurement of goods and services estimated to \ncost  less  than  $1,000,000.  For  specialized  equipment,  such  as  proprietary  software  and  small \nmaterials contracts valued at less than $100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed. \n \n\nFigure 1: Select Contract Packages\u2013Infrastructure \n\nNSUSC \nManagement Team \nManaging \nDirector \n\nInstitutional \nDevelopment and  \nProgram Implementation\n\nFinance \nDirector \n\nOperations \nDirector \n\nWater Supply and \nWastewater \nManagement \nImprovements \n\nSolid Waste\nManagement\nImprovements\n\n \nt\ni\nn\nU\n \ns\nk\nr\no\nW\n\n \nl\na\nt\ni\np\na\nC\n\nContract Packages \nA1-A3: Consultancy Studies \nADTA Component 1:\nOperational and Ogranizational\nSupport\n\nMethod\nQCBS\nQCBS\n\nB1: Water Supply and\n      Wastewater Improvements \nB2: Water Quality Testing \nB3: Design and Construction \n      Supervision, Mapping and \n      Feasibility\n\nICB \n\nNCB \nQCBS\n\nC1: Sanitary Landfills and\n      Equipment\nC2: Secondary Collection\n       Equipment\nC3: Concrete Base for Skips \nB3: Design and Construction \n       Supervision\n\nNCB: Design-\n Build\nICB \n\nNCB \nQCBS\n\n \n\nICB  =  international  competitive  bidding,  NCB  =  national  competitive  bidding,  NSUSC  =  North  Urban  Services \nCorporation Limited, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nConsultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \n60. \nprocedures, consultant qualification selection, and/or individual consultant selection procedures \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time).

Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Investment \nProgram. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program \nwill  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of GOS, NSUSC and other USCs, and of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n63. \nGood  governance  in  municipal  services  requires,  among  other  things,  (i)  information, \nskills,  and  autonomy  to  practice  sound  management;  (ii)  delinking  tariffs  and  staffing  from \npolitical  processes \nlow,  service  unsustainable,  consumers \nunempowered,  and  utilities \ninefficient;  (iii)  rigorous  engineering,  mapping,  and  asset \nmanagement  (and  not  just  building);  (iv)  freedom  from  non-merit-based  human  resource \npractices, which, together with poor information systems and political influence, allow so-called \n\u201cghost\u201d  workers  to  flourish;  (v)  curtailing  distorted  incentives  that  reward  asset  creation  rather \nthan service delivery and customer satisfaction; (vi) discouraging mediocrity and acceptance of \nintermittent  supplies  and  non-potable,  nonrevenue  water  as  the  norm,  because  solving  these \nproblems  would  curtail  rent-seeking  opportunities  for  those  who  understand  how  to  work  the \nsystems  to  their  advantage;  (vii)  closing  the  disconnect  between  operations  and  planning  and \nconstruction to enhance accountability for long-term performance of infrastructure assets; (viii) \nintroducing  contractual  arrangements  and  market \nto  clearly  define  roles  and \nresponsibilities,  and  to better  align service  provider  incentives  with  performance  requirements; \n(ix) helping customers understand that cost-recovery tariffs covering operations and, over time, \ncapital investment are essential to eliminate rent-seeking middlemen and hold service providers \nmore  accountable  to  the  consumer;  and,  finally,  (x)  discouraging  \u201cvertical\u201d  programs  which, \nunless channeled appropriately through the USCs, will undermine progress toward sustainable \nurban services and revitalized secondary cities.36 \n   \n64. \nIn the context of anticorruption and good governance, the Investment Program aims to \nincrease GOS\u2019 public accountability and its service delivery institutions37 while reducing the risk \nof  corruption  by,  among  other  things,  (i)  introducing  USCs  as  autonomous  public  limited \ncompanies able to competitively hire qualified staff (including accountants) and ring-fence their \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2003. Asian Water Supplies, Reaching the Urban Poor. Manila (Chapter 13). \n37 With  respect  to  increased  accountability  for  service  delivery,  the  attached  technical  assistance  (para.  77)  will \nsupport  NSUSC  to  establish  transparent  and  accessible  public  and  consumer  grievance  redress  systems.  It  will \nsupport  development  of  a  citizen  report  card  system.  The  findings  from  the  surveys  will  be  disseminated  to  the \npublic, and forums will be arranged to provide feedback to NSUSC senior management. \n\nforces \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nfinances;  (ii)  introducing  boards  of  directors  with  skills-based,  independent  nominees;  (iii) \neliminating the disconnect between asset creation and service outcomes by ensuring the USCs, \nnot  other  line  agencies  or  entities,  are  responsible  for  infrastructure  development;  and  (iv) \nintroducing contractual relationships between the stakeholders, including SAMAs and financing \nagreements. To further buttress the Investment Program reforms, TA will help NSUSC and GOS \nto  (i)  establish  systems  to  monitor  service  delivery,  and  promote  consumer  awareness  and \nprovider  responsiveness;  (ii)  tackle  the  serious  operational  challenges  of  data  management, \nnonrevenue water, and illegal connections; (iii) improve existing outsourcing contracts; and (iv) \nleverage private sector resources to incentivize better service delivery.  \n \n65. \nGOS,  through  the  PSU,  urban  unit,  NSUSC,  and  subsequent  USCs  as  formed,  will \ndisclose  basic  information  concerning  activities  and  progress  of  the  Investment  Program,  as \nappropriate, \nincluding  progress  reports  on  sector  reform  actions,  procurement-related \ninformation, financial statements, and reports on physical progress and outcomes. With regard \nto  procurement,  lists  of  participating  bidders,  names  of  winning  bidders,  basic  details  of  the \nbidding  procedures  adopted,  contract  values,  and  lists  of  goods  and  services  procured  will  be \ndisclosed.  Consideration  will  be  given  to  adopting  e-tendering  processes  for  selected \nprocurement to enhance fair, transparent, and efficient bidding procedures. Information will be \ndisseminated  widely  on  the  relevant  websites  and  at  relevant  office  locations,  including  by \nposting to bulletin boards at offices of the participating TMAs, the regional offices of the PSU, \nand NSUSC customer service units at town level. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nEach  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \n66. \ndisbursement  arrangements  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  individual  loan \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n67. \nTo  ensure  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds and  to  expedite  project implementation, \nimmediately  after  the  effectiveness  of  each  tranche,  two  project  imprest  accounts  will  be \nestablished at National Bank of Pakistan: one for P&DD and PSU to cover eligible expenditures \nunder parts A and D of the Investment Program, and one for NSUSC in the first tranche (then \none for each USC under the subsequent tranches) to cover eligible expenditures under parts A, \nB,  and  C.  Disbursement  arrangements  are  diagrammed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  In \nconnection with the P&DD\u2019s imprest account, P&DD will establish a separate escrow account at \nNational  Bank  of  Pakistan,  with  an  escrow  arrangement  and  independent  verification \nmechanism  that  are  additional  arrangements  to  manage  the  funds  specifically  for  Part  D,  as \nelaborated in Supplementary Appendix E. The imprest accounts will be established, managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  the \nagreed detailed arrangements. The total amount to be deposited into the imprest accounts will \nnot exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the \nimprest accounts for the next 6 months, or 10% of the related loan amount, whichever is lower. \nThe  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible \nexpenditures  for  the  Investment  Program  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  into  the  imprest \naccounts.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  not  exceed  $100,000.  The  loan  proceeds  may  also  be  disbursed \ndirectly to the consultants and contractors under the direct payment procedure. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n8. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n68. \nTo  expedite  construction,  the  Government  has  requested,  and  ADB  has  approved, \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  for  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services, \nincluding the recruitment of consultants for feasibility studies, detailed engineering designs, and \npreparation of bidding documents for subprojects and associated civil works.  \n \n69. \nThe  Government  and  NSUSC  (other  USCs)  were  (will  be)  informed  that,  for  expenses \nincurred  under  advance  contracting  to  be  eligible  for  ADB\u2019s  retroactive  financing,  such \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Once  the  loan  becomes  effective,  up  to  20%  of  the \namount  may  be  used  to  finance  civil  works,  equipment,  and  consulting  services  expenditures \nincurred  pursuant  to  advance  contracting  during  the  period  not  exceeding  12  months  prior  to \nsigning  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement  under  the  MFF.  Alternatively,  the \nGovernment and USCs may opt for advance contracting without retroactive financing, in which \ncase  the  procurement  procedures  completed  under  advance  contracting  do  not  conclude  with \nthe award of contract until after the loan becomes effective.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Report \n\n \nGoS through the PSU will establish an IPPMS acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the \n70. \neffectiveness  of  the  first  loan  under  the  MFF.  The  IPPMS  will  help  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nperformance  of  the  Investment  Program,  as  well  as  of  subprojects  under  each  loan.    It  will \nincorporate a set of performance monitoring indicators relating to outputs and outcomes in the \nDMF,  including  service delivery  performance,  physical  implementation,  institutional  reform  and \ncapacity-development milestones.  The PSU will develop baseline data for each of the selected \nindicators and conduct annual surveys with the assistance of consultants, and update ADB on \nthe  progress  against  each  indicator.  For  subprojects  procured  under  the  turnkey  and  design-\nbuild-operate  modalities,  key  performance  indicators  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  developed \nduring  the  preparation  of  requests  for  proposals  and  draft  contract  documents  for  each \nsubproject. \n \n The PSU will prepare quarterly progress reports on the Investment Program, including \n71. \nprogress against the above performance monitoring indicators, to be submitted to ADB within 30 \ndays from the quarter\u2019s close. The reports will incorporate the information provided by each of \nthe  USCs  (through  its  board).38 The  reports  will  discuss  progress  made  during  the  period  of \nreview,  changes  if  any  on  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties  encountered  and \nremedial actions taken, and work to be undertaken in the coming quarter. The USCs will also be \nresponsible for providing information as required to the independent verifier. \n \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n \n72. \nADB,  GOS,  and  the  USCs  will  conduct  quarterly  review  of  the  implementation  of  each \nindividual  tranche.  The  review  will  discuss  the  progress  of  the  individual  tranche  and  any \nchanges  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  needing  to  be  undertaken \ntoward achieving the objectives of the subprojects and overall Investment Program.  \n \n73. \nA midterm review of each individual tranche will be undertaken by ADB, GOS, and the \nUSCs.  It  will  include  reviewing  a  summary  of  contracts  awards  and  disbursements, \n\n                                                 \n38 These targets will be reflected in each USC\u2019s annual work plan and budget and serve as the basis for monitoring \n\nprogress. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nimplementation  progress  including  progress  against  service  delivery  performance,  reform, \ninstitutional development, and capacity building milestones. The midterm review will also identify \nproblems or weaknesses in implementation arrangements and agree on any changes needed. \nA  similar  midterm  review  of  the  Investment  Program  by  ADB,  GOS,  and  the  USCs  will  be \nundertaken in the fifth year from the date of ADB\u2019s approving the MFF.  \n \n74. \nGOS will submit to ADB of a subprogram completion report within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the subprogram, and an Investment Program completion report within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Investment Program. These reports shall provide detailed evaluation \nof  the  subprograms  and  the  Investment  Program,  respectively,  covering  the  design;  costs; \ncontractors\u2019  and  consultants\u2019  performance;  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts; \neconomic rate of return; and other details for each subproject and the Investment Program, as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Review, Accounts, and Audits \n\n \nThe PSU,39 urban unit, and USCs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate \n75. \nto  identify  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  under  the  MFF,  including \nexpenditures  for  works,  equipment,  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local \nfunds.  Each  USC  should  have  a  full  set  of  financial  statements.  These  project  accounts  and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  GOS  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  (including \nseparate  audit  opinions  on  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  and  expenditure \nprocedures)  and  audited  financial  statements  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each \nfiscal year. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \nTA  in  the  amount  of  $2,500,000  will  be  financed  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \n76. \nSpecial  Fund  to  support  (i)  NSUSC  in  achieving  performance  improvement  and  implementing \norganizational changes required for sustainable service provision; and (ii) public awareness and \noutreach, public monitoring of services, and customer care systems. The TA aims to increase \nthe  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  delivered  by \nNSUSC  to  its  customers.  P&DD  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA,  and  its  components  will  be \nimplemented by NSUSC and P&DD. Details on the TA and cost estimates are in Appendix 11. \n\nfor  achieving \n\nimprovements  and \n\ntechnical  and  operational \n\n \nThe TA has two parts. Component A supplements the Investment Program\u2019s assistance \n77. \nto  NSUSC \nimplementing \norganizational  changes  specifically  to  (i)  assist  with  information  gathering,  (ii)  implement \noperational  improvement  programs,  (iii)  improve  outsourcing  arrangements,  and  (iv)  develop \nand  implement  public-private  partnership  transactions.  Component  B  supports  (i)  customer \nawareness  of  reforms  in  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services;  (ii)  communications \nbetween  service  providers  and  customers;  (iii)  public  monitoring  of  service  delivery;  (iv) \naccountability  of  service  providers  to  the  public;  and  (v)  development  of  a  customer  care \nsystem.  \n \n78. \nComponent A will require 42 person-months of international and 100 person-months of \nnational consulting services. Component B will require 2 person-months of international and 20 \nperson-months  of  national  consulting  services,  plus  315  person-months  of  customer  relations \nstaff and IT support. The TA will be implemented over 44 months from April 2009. International \n\n                                                 \n39 Any regional offices of the PSU should maintain separate accounts. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nand national consulting firms and individuals will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses \n\nA. \n \n79. \nAn economic analysis was prepared for each of the proposed first tranche investments \nin  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  (Appendix  12).  The  gross  economic  benefits  of  the \nsubprojects  and  the  first  tranche  program  were  evaluated  based  on  willingness-to-pay  (WTP) \nanalysis. Based on a recent survey,40 the mean WTP was calculated at PRs566 per month for \nservice  charge  and  PRs3,620  for  one-time  connection.  The  evaluated  economic  costs  of  the \nsubprojects include (i) operating costs for the service provision after implementing subprojects, \nand (ii) capital costs of subprojects. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) values for the \nsubprojects range from 14% to 22% for water supply and wastewater improvements and 18% to \n44% for SWM improvements.  \n \nFinancial viability of NSUSC was evaluated through a financial model and in accordance \n80. \nwith  ADB  guidelines. 41 Currently,  the  provision  of  water,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  is \nfinancially  unsustainable.  Collected  tariffs  cover  a  small  fraction  of  operating  costs,  and  the \nestimated loss in FY2006 for the subject towns in the first tranche is more than PRs130 million. \nThe  Investment  Program  aims  to  first  achieve  significant  improvements  in  service,  making  it \neasier to justify tariff increases necessary to achieve cost recovery. The NSUSC financial model \nindicates  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  of  5%  for  NSUSC  over  a  10-year  projection \nperiod  (2008\u20132018).  The  financial  return  reflects  the  gradual  increase  in  average  tariffs  as \nservices improve and user fees are introduced or raised. The NSUSC  operating revenues are \nprojected to improve, and it is able to cover operating costs by FY2017. However, NSUSC still \nhas to rely on GOS subsidies for TMA-deputed staff costs. The Investment Program is expected \nto achieve financial sustainability in water supply services over 3 years. Wastewater and SWM \nwill  take  longer,  depending  upon  tariffs  and  any  future  tax-based  cost  recovery.  The  financial \nanalysis is in Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\n81. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  revealed  weak  financial  management  at  TMA \nlevel,  where  the  responsibility  for  basic  urban  services  resides.  The  Investment  Program \nsupports establishing USCs and financial management reforms at corporate level to address the \nimpact of these weaknesses on service provision. Financial management arrangements for the \nInvestment  Program  aim  to  create  obligations  for  a  higher  level  of  transparency  and \naccountability. 42  These  obligations  include  those  arising  from  incorporation  under  the \nCompanies Ordinance 1984, delegating functions of services delivery under SAMAs, obligating \npredictable  flows  of  operations  and  maintenance  financing  under  tripartite  operational  support \nfunding agreements, and professional oversight of operational support funds by an independent \nverifier. The Investment Program and supporting TA assist the design of operating procedures, \nfinancial safeguards, and monitoring systems, and they finance skilled technical specialists.

Financial management and \nreporting  obligations  cover,  among  others,  (i)  USC  financial  performance;  (ii)  disbursements  from  transition  and \noperations  support  funding  mechanisms;  (iii)  disbursement  of  capital  expenditure  funds;  and  (iv)  subproject \npreparation, implementation, and progress monitoring. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ninternal  financial  management  systems  for  the  USCs  will  conform  to  best  practice  design  for \nutility  companies.  Part  A  of  the  Investment  Program  will  support  development  of  financial \nmanagement  systems  in  USCs.  Overall,  the  major  risks  are  adequately  mitigated  under  the \nInvestment Program, and adequate funding and guidance will be provided to construct financial \nmanagement  systems  on  a  fundamentally  sound  corporate  base.  The  summary  financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nC. \n\nSummary of Benefits, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development \n\nThe population of the Investment Program cluster TMAs, estimated at 4 million persons, \n82. \nwill  enjoy  sustainable  benefits  from  the  Investment  Program  through  enhanced  capacities  for \ncity  planning,  management,  and  urban  service  delivery.  Specifically,  they  will  benefit  from \nimproved  quality,  continuity,  and  coverage  of  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services. \nResidents  of  some  20  secondary  towns  in  Sindh  will  enjoy  the  benefits  of  enhanced  living \nconditions and improved health as their basic urban services are upgraded and access to them \nexpanded.  Benefits  from  the  first  tranche  include  (i)  an  estimated  18,000  new  or  rehabilitated \nwater supply connections under DNI zones targeting potable, continuous service (representing \na  55%  increase  over  current  registered  connections);  (ii)  a  45%  increase  in  treated  water \navailability; (iii) priority fixes for drainage and sewerage problems; and (iv) secondary collection \ncapacity  built  to  handle  over  90%  of  the  waste  generation  in  each  of  the  participating  towns. \nTable  3  highlights  selected  tranche  1  benefits.  Less  tangible  benefits  include  (i)  improved \nfinancial planning, budgeting, and information systems (including system maps and inventories, \nthe  building  blocks  for  good  utility  management);  (ii)  greater  customer  orientation  and  more \ninformed,  responsible  consumers;  and  (iii) increased  performance  orientation  as  the  corporate \nstructure affords deputed TMA staff the necessary physical resources and technical supervision \nto do their jobs well.    \n \n\nTable 3: Investment Program Benefits (Tranche 1) \n\nItem \nHouseholds with Piped Connections (%) \nNumber Households with Potable Water > 20 hours day in DNI zones \nTreated Water Available (cubic meters per day) \nHouseholds with Access to Solid Waste Collection (%) \nWaste Collected (%) \nNumber Sanitary Landfills in Interior Sindh \n\n2008\u20132009 \n37 \nnone \nnone \n37 \n46 \nnone \n\n2012\u20132013 \n\n52 \n18,000 \n83,646 \n90 \n95 \n4 \n\n            DNI = distribution network improvement. \n            Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n83. \nAs  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  in  Appendix  14  highlights,  many \nhouseholds  in  Sindh\u2019s  secondary  town  areas  have  low  incomes  and  many  have  no  formal \nconnection  to  piped  network  services.43 These  households  represent  a  major  consumer  group \nand opportunity for the USCs. The Investment Program will support the development of service \ndelivery strategies for low-income consumers which can include reducing barriers to connection, \nusing small-scale service providers, adopting pro-poor tariffs, targeting customer outreach, and \nother  innovative  approaches  (Supplementary  Appendix  I).  A  specially  staffed  low-income \nconsumer unit in NSUSC will initiate these strategies in North Sindh. \n \n84. \nThe Investment Program will have a particularly positive impact on women and children \nin  the  USC  coverage  areas.  As  household  managers  and  caregivers,  women  are  the  primary \nusers of these basic urban services.  The Investment Program will finance advisory services to \n\n                                                 \n43 Of  864  households  recently  surveyed  by  Gallup  Pakistan  in  North  Sindh,  38%  had  no  piped  connection.  New \n\nSukkur lags even further behind, with 73% of those surveyed being unconnected. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\ndevelop  gender-sensitive  customer  outreach  and  public  accountability  mechanisms.  USC \noutreach to customers at town level will be designed to reach women in their communities and \nin  their  homes.    A  Gender  Action  Plan  will  guide  mainstreaming  these  concerns  for  inclusion \nand  empowerment.  There  is  also  provision  for  one  third  of  the  USC  independent  board \nmembers to be women.  The Gender Action Plan is in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nD. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguards  \n\n85. \nSocial  Safeguards.  The  Investment  Program  will  minimize  resettlement  impacts  by \nprioritizing  rehabilitation  and  optimizing  work  within  existing  facilities.  New  construction  is \nproposed on vacant government land where feasible. To ensure compliance with Government \nand  ADB  policies  and  requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement,  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  Pakistan  and  Sindh \nProvince,  and  the  operational  procedures  for  MFF  processing.  The  LARF  will  guide  the \nimplementation  of  subprojects,  outlining  the  objectives,  policy  principles,  procedures  for  land \nacquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected persons. A \nsummary  LARF  is  in  Appendix  15,  and  the  full  LARF  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K.  Land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for  subprojects  in  tranche  1  is  expected  to  have \nnon-significant impacts and the tranche is categorized as B; short LARPs have been prepared \naccordingly. Appraisal of successive PFRs will require preparation of LARPs for all subprojects \nwith land acquisition and resettlement issues, to be presented for ADB approval with submission \nof the PFR. The subprojects in the first tranche of the MFF will have no impact on indigenous \npeoples. \n \n86. \nEnvironmental  Safeguards.  The  provision  of  potable  piped-water  supply  plus \nwastewater  and  SWM  improvements  will  improve  the  environment  in  each  participating  town. \nThe design involves simple, appropriate, low-cost technology and does not pose any significant \nadverse environmental consequences. The Investment Program has been categorized as B for \nthe  purposes  of  environmental  safeguards.  Potential  negative  environmental  impacts  for  each \nproject  are  mainly  short-term  in  nature  during  the  construction  period  and  can  be  easily \nminimized  by  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  and  environmentally  sound  engineering  and \nconstruction  practices.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  prepared \nfollowing  ADB  procedures44 is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L.  For  each  PFR,  the  USCs  will \nprepare  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  or  environmental  impact  assessments  for \neach subproject or for groups of similar subprojects in the same subsector, as appropriate. The \nIEEs  for  the  first  tranche  show  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  (Supplementary \nAppendix M). As these IEEs, including environment management plans, were prepared based \non field reconnaissance survey and secondary reports, they will be improved during the detailed \nengineering design stage. ADB\u2019s review and clearance of the revised subproject IEE, including \nthe environment management plan, will be a condition precedent for release of relevant tender \ndocuments.  \n \n87. \nEnvironmental subproject selection criteria ensure that the Investment Program will not \nhave  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  and  will  have  no  impacts  on  environmentally \nsensitive  areas.  Impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and/or  irreversible  will  be  avoided. \nPotential  negative  environmental  impacts  of  typical  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  mostly \nlocalized  and  temporary.  These  impacts  can  largely  be  avoided  through  proper  subproject \ndesign  (particularly  site  selection)  or  through  appropriate  choice  of  water  and  wastewater \n\n                                                 \n44 The  EARF  follows  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \n\nGuidelines (2003).   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe  Investment  Program  faces  a  number  of  risks  in  implementation,  but  the  key  risks \n\ntreatment  technologies  and  process  design  parameters.  Alternatively,  they  can  be  mitigated \nthrough  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  The \nEARF  will  help  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  government  and  ADB  environmental \nrequirements  and  guide  the  design  and  implementation  of  future  subprojects.  The  safeguards \ncell of each USC will have an environmental safeguard specialist who, with assistance from an \ninternational  environmental  consultant,  will  apply  the  EARF.  Training  will  be  conducted  by  the \ninternational consultant to pertinent USC, PSU, and TMA staff.  \n \nE. \n \n88. \nhave been discussed with the Government and mitigation measures agreed.  \n \nImplementation  Delays  Due  to  Weak  Capacity  of  New  and  Existing  Institutions. \n89. \nThe Investment Program will finance teams of advisors to support the provincial PSU and urban \nunit and the USCs. Each USC will be staffed with appropriate senior management and technical \nsupervisors,  competitively  recruited  from  the  open  market,  in  addition  to  deputed  TMA \npersonnel  who  bring  their  institutional  memory.  Risks  of  delays  in  first  tranche  program \nimplementation  are  mitigated  through  upfront  grant  support  from  ADB\u2019s  Water  Financing \nPartnership  Facility  to  (i)  expedite  contracting  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  works,  and  (ii) \ndesign  a  public  awareness  campaign  to  sustain  public  and  political  momentum  for  reforms. \nBeyond this start-up period, attached advisory TA will help operationalize NSUSC and support \nservice delivery improvements.  \n \nDelays in Government Reform Actions to Replicate the USC Model. These include \n90. \npotential political interference in the functions of the USCs and their boards. These risks have \nbeen  mitigated  in  part  through  extensive  dialogue  with  the  Government  since  2006  on  the \nfundamental reforms under the Investment Program. The risk will be further mitigated through (i) \nlinkage  between  achieving  milestones  in  the  reform  action  plan  and  subsequent  financing \nrequest approvals, (ii) ADB\u2019s close supervision and continued dialogue with the highest levels of \nGOS on implementation, and (iii) targeted attached advisory TA support in these critical reform \nareas.   \n \nContinued Vertical Funding of Capital Investments in NSUSC Coverage Areas.45 A \n91. \nmajor risk to the Investment Program is continued, ad hoc so-called \u201cvertical\u201d investment under \nvarious  federal,  provincial,  and  donor-supported  programs  that  frequently  results  in  low-grade \ninfrastructure assets, inadequately coordinated with the subsequent operator, without adequate \nprovision  for  operation  and  maintenance,  and  not  factored  into  any  tariff  setting.  Such \ninvestments are unsustainable. This type of funding would undermine the USCs and continue to \nfinancially  burden  the  Government.  These  risks  will  need  to  be  mitigated  through  a  three-\npronged  approach:  (i)  continued  dialogue  with  federal,  provincial,  and  local  governments,  and \ndonor partners; (ii) developing within the USC the capacity to effectively harness vertical funds; \nand  (iii)  GOS\u2019  notification  of  the  USC  as  a  single  point  of  accountability  for  delivering  the \nrelevant services to agreed coverage areas by routing any related government or development \npartner-supported project proposal through the USC.46 \n \n\n                                                 \n45 Vertical funding refers to provincial line agency or federally driven infrastructure investment in USC coverage areas \nthat is not part of the local planning process. Such investments typically fall outside any planning for operation and \nmaintenance or sustainability. \n\n46 This  notification  is  to  be  provided  as  a  condition  precedent  to  any  financing  under  the  Investment  Program, \n\npreferably as a condition precedent to loan negotiations. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n92.  Weak Coordination Among GOS Agencies Whose Support is Necessary for USCs \nto Operate Effectively. This includes resistance from provincial line agencies that will no longer \nhave  the  construction  mandate  in  USC  coverage  areas.  The  risk  of  weak  coordination  will  be \naddressed through inclusion of PSU-supervised regional offices at town level to liaise on a daily \nbasis  between  NSUSC,  the  TMAs,  and  other  provincial  authorities.  In  addition,  incentive \nschemes will be established to recognize cooperative action between key TMA staff, and other \nline agency staff, and the relevant USC, based on USC performance against its business plan. \nProvincial  line  agencies,  including  the  departments  of  Finance,  Local  Government,  and  Public \nHealth  Engineering,  will  be  on  the  PSC  that  is  chaired  by  P&DD  and  charged  with  ensuring, \namong other things, high-level interagency coordination. \n \n93. \nLack of Interest by Private Sector Professionals and Firms Willing to Work in the \nProgram Areas. The Investment Program assumes professional managers and candidates for \nindependent  board  members  can  be  attracted  to  work  in  or with  a  USC  in  interior Sindh.  This \nrisk  is  mitigated  by  employing  a  professional  recruitment  firm  to  design  the  job  description, \ncompensation  and  incentive  package,  and  employment  contract.  The  risk  is  considered \nmanageable  given  that  there  are  examples  of  successful  commercial  operations  in  interior \nSindh,  and  given  recent  success  by  the  Government  of  Punjab  in  recruiting  on  a  competitive \nbasis managing directors for its water and sanitation authorities. \n \nResistance from TMA Staff Deputed to USCs. There is risk of poor cooperation from \n94. \nTMA staff to be deputed to the USCs from the TMA. This will be addressed by the proper design \nand  consultation  on  the  SAMAs  to  address  conditions  of  deputed  staff  employment.  These \nconsultations  will  allay  any  concerns  on  pension  rights  and  demonstrate  the  potential \nadvantages of USC employment, including incentivized pay, training, more assured resources, \nand  growth  opportunities.  The  risk  of  nonperformance  of  TMA  staff  deputed  to  USCs  is \nmitigated  by  provisions  allowing  for  the  USCs  to  transfer  the  staff  back  to  the  TMA  after  a \nprobationary period. \n \n95. \nResistance  by  Political  Leadership,  Government  Officials,  or  Customers  to \nIncreases  in  User  Charges.  There  is  agreement  on  the  need  for  cost  recovery  in  service \ndelivery,  which  is  to  be  achieved  as  services  are  improved  and  trust  rebuilt.  WTP  surveys \nsuggest  the  public  is  willing  to  pay  for  improved  service.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  clear \narticulation of these principles in the  SAMAs, through continued advocacy by NSUSC and the \nPSU,  with  support  of  tariff  structuring  advisors,  and  through  the  public  awareness  program \nunder  the  attached  advisory  TA.  Concerns  of  low-income  consumers  will  be  addressed  by  a \nspecial  unit  with  dedicated  staff. 47 There  is  binding  assurance  that  restricts  SCIP  financing \nunder subsequent tranches to those TMAs that have increased their tariffs to levels agreed in \nthe  USC  business  plans  and  consistent  with  WTP  survey  data  and  the  independent  verifier \nassessment.  Government  acceptance  of  these terms  signals  joint  agreement  on  this  essential \ncondition for sustainability. \n \n96. \nChanges in the Sindh Local Government Ordinance or Local Government System. \nThe  Investment  Program  has  been  designed  to  withstand  possible  changes  in  the  local \ngovernment  system  by  adopting  a  corporate  structure  and  organization  under  the  Companies \nOrdinance 1984. The USCs, as public limited companies with appropriate successor in interest \nprovisions, are considered sufficiently robust to withstand changes in federal or provincial law. \nThe  reliance  on  professional  management  and  corporate  boards  with  independent  directors \n\n                                                 \n47 Concerns  from  civil  society  over  the  perceived  commercialization  of  urban  service  provision  will  be  addressed \nthrough  these  outreach  programs  and  public  awareness  activities.  Adopting  the  pilot  introduction  of  24/7  service \ndelivery in DNI zones should also address these concerns. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nshould  also  support  continuity  of  program  implementation  as  the  local  governance  system \nevolves. \n \n97. \nSubproject  Implementation  Delays  Due  to  Political  Instability  and  Potential  Civil \nUnrest. The MFF structure, with its 10-year program period and flexible timing of loan tranches, \nmeans  that  the  SCIP  can  adapt  better  to  changes  in  the  political  and  security  environment. \nPakistan  and  Sindh\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and  resilience  in  the  midterm  is  key  to \nmitigating such risks, and ADB has been working closely with the Government on the necessary \npolicy  and  structural  reforms.48 Strong  support  by  local  political  leaders  and  opinion  makers, \nhowever,  will  be  the  more  important  factor  mitigating  such  risks.  Thus,  during  Investment \nProgram preparation, explicit support from political leadership was obtained.   \n \n98. \nGovernance  Risks.  Financial  and  operational  management  arrangements  under  the \nInvestment  Program  are  unique  in  seeking  to  create  obligations  for  greater  transparency  and \naccountability.  Organizing  service  providers  under  the  Companies  Ordinance  1984  mandates \nmore \ninformation;  managerial \nindependently  audited \nautonomy; and sound board governance. The SAMAs articulate roles and responsibilities, and \nthey  set  performance  targets.  The  Tripartite  Operational  Suport  and  Capital  Investment \nFinancing  Agreements  and  operational  support  funding  mechanism,  together  with  the \nindependent verifier function, obligate predictable financing flows for operations and investment. \nThe  Investment  Program  mitigates  governance  and  operational  risk  through  these  contractual \nobligations,  professional  and  independent  oversight  mechanisms  (complemented  by  citizen \nsatisfaction surveys under the attached advisory TA and under the proposed Sindh Growth and \nRural  Revitalization  Program),  and  strengthening  of  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  wing  of \nP&DD. Finally, at the corporate level under tranche 1, the Investment Program and related TA \nwill  support  enhanced  operating  procedures,  financial  safeguards,  monitoring  systems,  and \ncorporate governance training. Overall, key risks are adequately mitigated under the Investment \nProgram, with specific funding and guidance to ensure that the new urban service providers are \nrooted in a fundamentally sound corporate base. \n \n\ntransparent,  and \n\nfinancial \n\ntimely, \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n99. \nThe Government and GOS have agreed to the following specific assurances, in addition \nto  the  standard  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the  FFA  and  the  individual  loan \nagreements  as  applicable,  subject  to  any  amendments  to  be  mutually  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and ADB: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  and  GOS  will  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  agreed \nreforms set forth in the Strategic Action Plan for Reform and Investment, which is \npart of the urban sector road map and Investment Program. \nThe Government and GOS will ensure that ADB is kept informed on policies and \nprograms  related  to  municipal  services  in  the  secondary  towns  of  Sindh  and \nother policies and programs that will materially affect the financial viability of each \nsubproject under the Investment Program. \nPrior  to  any  intervention  related  to  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services  in  a  particular  town  cluster  under  the \nInvestment  Program,  GOS  will  ensure  the  timely  incorporation  of  the  relevant \n\n                                                 \n48 These programs include the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program and the proposed Sindh Growth and \n\nRural Revitalization Program.   \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nUSCs  pursuant  to  the  Companies  Ordinance  1984,  as  may  be  amended  from \ntime to time and allow the USC to operate as a limited liability company. \nPrior  to  any  intervention  related  to  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement  infrastructure  and  services  in  a  particular  town  cluster  under  the \nInvestment Program, GOS will issue the necessary notification(s) to allow USCs \nto  effectively  plan,  design,  construct,  operate,  manage,  and  maintain  all  water \nsupply, wastewater, and solid waste management infrastructure and services, in \ntheir  respective  coverage  areas.  The  coverage  areas  will  be  the  areas  to  be \nagreed upon between the GOS, the relevant TMAs and USCs, to the satisfaction \nof ADB. \n GOS will provide the necessary resources needed to ensure that (a) the USCs \nestablished under the Investment Program are effective, sustainable vehicles for \nthe delivery of water supply, wastewater, and solid waste management services, \nand  (b)  the  facilities  constructed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  continue  to \nbe in good condition during and after the completion of the Investment Program. \nGOS  will  ensure  that  the  participating  TMAs  increase  their  tariffs  to  customers \nreceiving  improved  services  and  that  the  increase  will  be  to  appropriate  levels, \ntaking  into  consideration  general  willingness-to-pay  survey(s)  from  reputed \nfirm(s) acceptable to ADB, and the real cost of delivering the improved service as \nassessed by the independent verifier. \n\n(vii)  GOS  will  ensure  that  the  USCs  have  adequate  enforcement  mechanism  to \neffectively  collect  service  fees  and  penalize  defaulters  in  order  to  improve  the \ncollection  efficiency,  deter  non-payment  and  ensure  sustainability  of  USC \noperations. \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  GOS will provide the USCs with timely assistance and support to ensure that the \nUSCs are able to effectively carry out their entire obligations to be set out under \nthe  SAMAs,  which  will  be  entered  into  between  the  relevant  TMAs  and  the \nrelevant USCs. \nGOS  will  provide  the  necessary  resources  needed  to  ensure  that  the  TMAs \nparticipating in the Investment Program are adequately staffed.  \nThe  Government  and  GOS  will,  and  will  cause  the  USCs,  to  ensure  that  all \nsubprojects and town clusters are selected in accordance with the agreed criteria \nset  out  in  the  Schedule  4  of  the  FFA  and  other  applicable  requirements  and \nguidelines for subproject implementation. The Government and GOS will monitor \nthe implementation of subprojects up through the completion of each subproject. \nThe Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, ensure that (a) all land \nand rights-of-way required for any subproject under the Investment Program are \nmade available in a timely manner, including the requirement for allocation in the \nannual budget for the financing of land acquisition and related resettlement costs \nunder  the  Investment  Program;  (b)  upon  completion  of  the  detailed  design  and \ndetailed  measurement  survey,  the  resettlement  plans  under  the  Investment \nProgram  will  be  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  the  affected  people  and  in \naccordance  with  the  LARF  agreed  upon  between  GOS  and  ADB  and  will  be \npromptly disclosed to the affected people; (c) any reports on the implementation \nof the resettlement plan to be prepared by an external monitoring and evaluation \nagency will be submitted to ADB on periodic basis, and (d) the entire involuntary \nresettlement  activities  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  LARF  and  resettlement  plans  agreed  upon  between  GOS \nand  ADB,  the  relevant  national  and  local  policies  on  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nPrior  to  issuance  of  notice  for  mobilization  for  civil  works  activities  under  a \nsubproject, GOS will ensure that (a) the LARP has been disclosed to the affected \n\n(xii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\npeople and submitted to ADB for review and approval, (b) the negotiations on the \nresettlement entitlements with the affected people have been completed, and (c) \nthe  affected  people  have  been  satisfactorily  compensated  for  their  loss  through \ncash payment or land replacement or other forms of agreed entitlement. \nIn  the  event  of  any  changes  to  the  agreed  LARPs,  including  on  the  agreed \ncompensation  to  the  affected  people,  GOS  will  inform  ADB  and  update  the \nLARPs accordingly, and submit the updated resettlement plans to ADB for review \nand approval.  \n\n(xiii) \n\n(xiv)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, ensure that the design, \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of all subproject facilities are carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and the Government\u2019s \nEnvironmental Protection Act, 1997. Any adverse environmental impacts arising \nfrom  the  construction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  subproject  facilities  will \nbe  minimized  by  implementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and  management \nmeasures  and  other  recommendations  specified  in  the  EARF  and  initial \nenvironmental  examinations/environmental  impact  assessments,  as  applicable. \nSubproject  assessment  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  EARF,  which \nhas been prepared based on the Government\u2019s environmental requirements and \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  Any  change  in  subproject  scope  will  be \nclassified  and  environmental  assessment  conducted  in  accordance  with  the \nEARF.  In  addition,  the  Government  and  GOS  will,  and  will  cause  USCs  to, \nensure  that  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  will  be  strictly \nimplemented. The Government, GOS, USCs, and ADB will also review progress \nin  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan \ncovering the subprojects financed under the loan prior to processing the follow-\nup loans. The Government and GOS will, and will cause the USCs to, submit to \nADB  annual  monitoring  reports  on  subprojects\u2019  environmental  performance  in \naccordance with the EARF.  \nThe  Government  and  GOS  will,  and  will  cause  USCs  to,  implement  the  gender \naction  plan  prepared  under  the  Investment  Program  to  encourage  gender-\nbalanced  consultation  and  participation  in  Investment  Program  planning  and \nimplementation,  including  representation  of  qualified  women  on  the  USCs\u2019 \nBoards  of  Directors.  GOS  will,  and  will  also  cause  USCs  to,  monitor  the \nsubproject  effects  on  women  during  implementation  of  each  subproject, \nincluding,  where  relevant,  with  gender-disaggregated  data  collected  pursuant  to \nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  IPPMS  and  the  gender \naction plan. \n\n(xv) \n\n(xvi)  The Government and GOS will, and will cause USCs to, ensure that (a) there is \nno differential payment between men and women for work of equal value, and (b) \ncivil  works  contractors  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance  activities  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  laws  and  regulations  of \nthe Government. \n\n(xvii)  The  Government  and  GOS  will  ensure  the  availability  and  timely  release  of \ncounterpart  funding  for  the  timely  implementation  of  the  subprojects  under  the \nInvestment Program.  \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed

urban population expected \n1. \nto be half of the total population by 2015. There is an urgent need to revitalize urban centers in \nPakistan  to  improve  living  standards  and  provide  more  competitive  platforms  for  economic \ngrowth.  At  present,  Pakistan\u2019s  cities  and  towns,  including  the  secondary  towns  in  Sindh,  are \nconstrained  by  weak  local  government  capacity;  insufficient  focus  on  cost  recovery  and  own-\nsource  revenue  generation;  inadequate  infrastructure;  absent  or  inefficient  municipal  service \nproviders;  and  a  lack  of  urban  management  and  planning  systems.  Inasmuch  as  Pakistan \nenvisions cities as engines of national growth, centers of economic activity and knowledge, and \nfocal  points  for  cultural  change,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  considers  urban \ndevelopment  a  strategic  priority.  Investment  in  the  urban  sector  in  Sindh  draws  on  ADB\u2019s \ndemonstrated  capacity  in  infrastructure  development  and  its  ability  to  catalyze  public-private \npartnerships in service delivery. The multitranche financing facility modality affords scope for a \nprogrammatic, long-term approach to revitalizing cities, guided by road maps for critical sector \nand  institutional  reforms.  The  Sindh  Cities  Improvement  Investment  Program  (SCIP  or  the \nInvestment  Program)  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  forward  assistance  program  that  supports \nurban service delivery, sustainable basic infrastructure, improved urban transport systems, and \nstrengthened  governance  and  institutions  for  better  municipal  management.1  A  core  strategic \nobjective  of  ADB  assistance  is  to  promote  efficient,  effective,  and  customer-focused  service \nproviders  with  incentives  and  capacity  to  improve  quality,  continuity,  and  coverage  of \ninfrastructure services.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nmore efficient and competitive cities and towns. Municipalities in Sindh should have  \n\nThe  vision  for  the  urban  sector  is  accelerated  national  growth  and  productivity  through \n\nRoad Map \n\nwell-managed utilities;  \nsound financial management; \nproper regulatory and oversight arrangements; and \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  measurable, targeted, and sustainable subsidies where they are necessary. \n\n \n3. \nThe Investment Program seeks to improve the quality, coverage, and reliability of water \nsupply,  wastewater  management,  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  services  for  an \nestimated  4  million  residents  in  participating  secondary  cities  in  Sindh  Province.  Enhanced \nfinancial  sustainability  of  these  services  is  essential.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  service \nproviders  will  have  clear  roles  and  strengthened  lines  of  accountability,  be  reoriented  toward \ncost  recovery  and  sustainability,  and  be  incentivized  to  perform.  The  following  underpins  the \nurban sector road map: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSustainability.  Focus  on  the  institutional  context  and  on  service  delivery,  with \ninfrastructure development seen in this context. \nthrough \nEfficiency.  Seek  efficiency  by \nestablishing  regional  utilities  and  clustering  local  governments,  introducing \nprivate sector participation, effective outsourcing, and management contracts.  \n\nleveraging  economies  of  scale \n\n                                                 \n1  The country partnership strategy is under preparation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n39\n\n         \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAccountability.  Pursue  corporate  models  and  markets,  including  service \ncompacts  and  contracts;  costs  and  performance  benchmarking;  and  ensuring \ninformation flow to customers to strengthen accountability of service providers. \nStrategic  Approaches.  Look  for  opportunities  to  tap  geographic  and  regional \nresources, such as trade links, transportation corridors, and business clusters. \nFinance.  Ensure  asset  investment  is  linked  to  strategies  for  maintenance  and \ncost recovery.  \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  Investment  Program  is  anchored  within  a  holistic  and  integrated  service  delivery \nreform  agenda,  comprising  (i)  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  service  delivery  reform,  (ii) \neffective  institutions  and  professional  management,  and  (iii)  sustainable  financing  of  urban \nservice  provision.  The  strategic  action  plan  for  reform  and  investment  is  in  Table  A3.1.  These \nkey reform milestones will trigger the release of the first, second and subsequent tranches of the \ninvestment loan. Together, the Investment Program and sequenced institutional reforms seek to \ntransform service delivery in urban Sindh in two-stages (Box A3.1). \n\nBox A3.1: Two-Stage Reform Process\n\nThe  Investment  Program  proposes  a  progressive,  two-stage  reform  process.  During  the  first  stage, \nparticipating cluster taluka municipal administrations (TMAs) join together to form a corporatized operating utility \nto  take  full  responsibility  for  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  systems.  These  urban \nservices  corporations  (USCs)  will  aggregate  water,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  operations  of  all \nparticipating  TMAs  into  a  single  institution  to  take  advantage  of  economies  of  scale  and  to  share  the  overhead \ncosts of professional management. Incentivized agreements will be put into place between the TMAs and USCs, \nthen  further  developed  with  more  private  sector  involvement  under  second-stage  reforms  and  introduction  of \nperformance-based  management  contracting.  The  USCs  are  transition  arrangements  before  introducing  more \ncomprehensive  public-private  partnerships  with  technically  qualified  private  operators  from  Pakistan\u2019s  business \ncommunity\u2014teamed up with international operator expertise\u2014to provide a more robust solution to the challenge \nof service delivery and infrastructure development.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nInvestment Program \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \nOverview.  The  Investment  Program  aims  to  improve  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement,  and  SWM  services  to  clusters  of  secondary  cities  in  Sindh  (Box  A3.2).  This,  in \nturn,  will  improve  the  urban  environment,  public  health,  and  economic  opportunities  for  an \nestimated 4 million urban residents of Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities. This will be achieved through \nan  integrated  program  of  institutional  reforms  and  investments  in  priority  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvements. The key institutional reform is the establishment of USCs, as \npublic limited companies, by participating local governments. The Investment Program has four \nparts: (i) urban planning, institutional development, and program management; (ii) water supply \nand wastewater management improvements; (iii) SWM improvements; and (iv) operational and \ntransition support funding to cover cash shortfalls in the newly established USCs in advance of \ntariff increases and increased cost recovery.   \n  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A3.1: Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program Action Plan for Reform and Investmenta \nWater Supply and Sanitation (WSS) and Solid Waste Management (SWM) \n\nTime Frameb \n\nIssues \nStrategy 1: Establish Corporate Structure and Systems for Improved Corporate Governance \nManagement structure for \ndelivering services weak;

Physical \n\nA.  \n \nSound  project  management  arrangements  and  reforms  are  essential  nonphysical \n1. \ninvestments  for  efficient  and  timely  delivery  of  outputs  and  outcomes  from  the  Sindh  Cities \nImprovement \nin \ninfrastructure alone are not sufficient to deliver the Investment Program objectives. The Urban \nPlanning, Institutional Development, and Program Implementation component (part A) will assist \nwith project execution functions, promoting reforms, and developing national capacity. Together \nwith the support for engineering design and construction supervision under parts B and C, the \nInvestment  Program  will assist with (i) implementation of the first-tranche investments; (ii) due \ndiligence  on,  and  preparation  of,  second  and  subsequent  tranche  investments;  and  (iii)  urban \nsector  planning,  sector  and  institutional  reforms,  and  results  measurement.  This  nonphysical \ninvestment\u2014the program management, capacity development, and implementation support\u2014is \nessential  to  the  Investment  Program.  It  backstops  and  guides  the  Government  and  urban \nservices corporation (USC) efforts to end the vicious cycle of weak planning, management, and \ninfrastructure that leads to failed urban services delivery.   \n \n2. \nThe  teams  of  consultants  contracted  through  firms  and  individually  will  assist  the \nInvestment  Program\u2019s  execution  at  the  provincial  and  USC  levels.  They  will  support  (i)  the \nprogram support unit (PSU) and the urban policy and strategic planning unit (urban unit), both \nwithin the Planning and Development Department (P&DD), at provincial level, and (ii) the USCs. \nAt  provincial  level,  individual  national  consultants  will  be  contracted  on  a  full-time  basis  under \nthe PSU and the urban unit. These individual specialists, together with permanent government \nstaff,  will  form  core,  full-time  teams  in  each  unit.  These  full-time  teams  will  be  guided  by \nadvisory consultants, comprising international and national experts, hired under a firm tasked to \nflexibly  support  the  provincial  government  in  executing  the  Investment  Program.  The  core \nimplementing  arms,  the  USCs,  will  have  permanent  professional  senior  management  and \ntechnical supervisors, recruited from the market, to implement the infrastructure subprojects and \noperate  the  systems.1  Under  the  first  tranche,  North  Sindh  Urban  Services  Corporation \n(NSUSC)  will  have  three  levels  of  management  or  supervisory  staff  for  this  function.  The \narrangements  for  the  first  tranche  are  outlined  below.  In  subsequent  tranches,  the  level  of \nconsultant inputs will decrease as capacity is developed in the PSU, urban unit, and USCs. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nthe necessary resources to, among other things, \n\nProgram management support will provide the Government of Sindh and the USCs with \n\nKey Tasks of Advisory and Support Teams \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nexecute  agreed  institutional  and  sector  reforms  in  the  Investment  Program\u2019s \nstrategic action plan and raise the profile of the urban sector in Sindh;  \nestablish and operationalize USCs; \nprepare detail or reference designs and implement first-tranche subprojects while \nensuring compliance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguards and other \nrequirements; \nroll out reforms, the USC model, and investments to new town clusters;  \n\n                                                 \n1  These market recruits will be augmented by deputed TMA staff who have been working in the USC urban coverage \n\nareas. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n \n54 \n \n\n(v) \n\nprepare  preliminary  subproject  designs  and  subsequent  loan  tranche  periodic \nfinancing  requests  (PFRs)  in  conjunction  with  engineering  design  consultants \nand the construction supervision and feasibility consulting team;  \nintroduce public-private partnerships for more effective service delivery; and \n\n(vi) \n(vii)  monitor and evaluate the Investment Program\u2019s results. \n \n4. \nSupport for capacity development will cut across these three organizations. The advisory \nteams  will  provide  on-the-job  and  more  formal  group  training  throughout  to  PSU,  USC,  urban \nunit, and relevant provincial, district and taluka-based staffing order to, among other things,  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\ndevelop provincial-level capacity to promote economic growth, coordinate urban \ninvestment, improve urban planning, and promote regulatory and tariff reforms;  \ndevelop district and local level capacity for urban planning;   \norient talukas in their new roles as NSUSC shareholders;  \nfurther  develop  NSUSC  manager  and  staff  capacity  for  utility  operations  and \nmanagement, including financial management and controls;  \ndevelop  NSUSC  and  PSU  capacity  for  due  diligence,  including  subproject \nidentification, preliminary design, and economic and financial evaluation; \ndevelop  NSUSC  capacity  for  procurement  of  works  and  service  contracts  and \nPSU and urban unit capacity for services contracts; and \ndevelop  PSU  and  NSUSC  capacity \nmonitoring, and program evaluation. \n\nfor  safeguards  compliance,  results \n\n \n5. \nThe program management, capacity building, and subproject implementation assistance \nput  the  Government  of  Sindh  (GOS)  and  NSUSC  at  the  core  of  executing  their  respective \ncomponents  while  providing  qualified,  full-time  national  and  intermittent  international  expertise \nas  support.  A  contingent  amount  will  be  allocated  for  the  PSU,  urban  unit,  and  NSUSC  to \nfacilitate  engaging  additional  expertise  according  to  need,  thus  allowing  enhanced  flexibility \nconsistent  with  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  focus  on  innovation  and  change  management.  In \naddition, support will be provided to NSUSC for subproject design and construction supervision, \nmapping  and  feasibility  studies,  and  preliminary  design  and  subproject  preparation.  The \nmanagers of the three implementing units\u2014the PSU program director, the urban unit head, and \nNSUSC\u2019s managing director\u2014will oversee these advisory and support teams. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  PSU  will  be  supported  by  a  firm  providing  intermittent  support  comprising  24 \nperson-months of international expertise and 60 person-months of national expertise. The firm \nwill  support  the  GOS  staff  and  a  team  of  9  individually  contracted  national  consultants  to  be \nembedded  in  the  PSU  on  a  full-time  basis.  Individual  consultant  support  will  total 396  person-\nmonths. These consultants will support the PSU to (i) implement the reform program, including \nrolling out the investments to new town clusters; (ii) prepare the periodic financing requests; (iii) \nensure  compliance  with  ADB  safeguards;  and  (iv)  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Investment \nProgram\u2019s  result.  Consulting  teams  and  their  relationships  to  PSU  staff  are  set  out  in  Figure \nA7.1. Outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix F. \n\nProgram Support Unit  \n\n \n\nSupport to the Urban Policy and Strategic Planning Unit (Urban Unit) \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe urban unit will be supported by a firm providing intermittent support comprising 18 \nperson-months of international expertise and 16 person months of national expertise. The firm \nwill support the GOS staff and a team of five individually contracted national consultants to be \nembedded  in  the  urban  unit  on  a  full-time  basis.  Individual  consultant  support  will  total  220 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n55\n\nperson-months.  These  consultants  will  support  the  urban  unit  to  establish  a  process  for \nprovince-wide  urban  development,  including  to  develop  an  urban  planning  process,  develop \nurban  policies,  compile  and  manage  urban  knowledge  and  information,  and  promote  reforms, \nincluding those included in the Investment Program\u2019s reform action plan. Consulting teams and \ntheir relationships to urban unit staff are set out in Figure A7.2.   \n \nD. \n\nSupport to the North Sindh Urban Services Corporation  \n\nThe  NSUSC  will  be  supported  by  a  firm  providing  intermittent  support  comprising  41 \n8. \nperson-months of international expertise and 49 person-months of national expertise. The firm \nwill  support  the  professional  staff  of  NSUSC,  reporting  to  the  managing  director.  The  firm  will \nsupport  (i)  utility  systems\u2019  technical  and  financial  operations,  as  well  as  human  resource \nmanagement; (ii) preliminary design and implementation for tranche 1 subprojects, including to \nsupervise  and  monitor  detailed  design  and  construction  of  facilities  created  under  the \nInvestment  Program;  (iii)  feasibility  studies  for  tranche  2  subprojects,  including  economic  and \nfinancial evaluations of subprojects; (iv) ongoing compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies; and \n(v) processing of consultant recruitment. Consulting teams and their relationships to NSUSC\u2019s \nmanagement are set out in Figure A7.3.   \n \nE. \n \n9. \nA  firm  will  be  responsible  for  verification  of  NSUSC  performance  against  targets  set  in \nthe  business  plan,  random  audits  of  NSUSC  funding  requests  and  NSUSC  operations, \nauthorization of payments from the operational and transition support fund, and related technical \nand financial auditing tasks. This assistance will entail 14 person-months of intermittent support \nover the first-tranche period. \n \nF. \n\nCapacity Building, Training, and Study Tours \n\nIndependent Verification Function \n\nSpecific \n\nrequirements  will  be  determined  during  early  stages  of \n\n10. \ntranche  1 \nimplementation.  Training  will  be  provided  for  NSUSC\u2019s  board  of  directors  and  key  staff,  GOS \nofficials and staff involved with the Investment Program\u2019s execution, as well as TMA and district \ngovernment officials and staff. Orientation tours will be supported where value can be obtained \nfrom exposure to similar service delivery models. \n \nG. \n\nEngineering Design, Construction Supervision, and Feasibility Consultants \n\n11. \nThe  scope  of  work  for  the  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  and  feasibility \nconsultants  comprises  (i)  detailed  designs  for  tranche  1  subprojects,  (ii)  preparing  tender \ndocuments for tranche 1 subprojects, (iii) supervising the construction of tranche 1 subprojects, \n(iv) conducting mapping and preparing feasibility studies and master plans, and (v) preliminary \ndesign and feasibility analysis for tranche 2 subprojects.

\nNORTH SINDH URBAN SERVICES CORPORATION LIMITED \n\nBackground \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe TA aims to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply, wastewater, and \n\n \nA. \n \nThis  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  reform  initiatives  under  the  Sindh  Cities \n1. \nImprovement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program  or  SCIP)  and  assist  the  newly \nformed  North  Sindh  Urban  Services  Corporation  (NSUSC)  to  become  a  more  efficient, \naccountable service provider. The TA has two integral components. Component A will develop \nthe  technical,  operational,  and  organizational  capacity  of  NSUSC  to  deliver  sustainable  water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  services.  Component  B  will  support \npublic awareness and outreach, public monitoring of services, and customer relations. The TA is \nconsistent  with  the  Pakistan  country  strategy  and  program  (update)  2006\u201320081  that  supports \nurban sector interventions focusing on institutional reform and improvement in service delivery. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nSWM services delivered by NSUSC while also increasing its accountability to its customers.  \n \n3. \nThe  outcomes  under  component  A  include  (i)  technical  and  financial  information \nbaselines  and  improved  information  on  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  systems;  (ii) \nenhanced  technical  capacity  of  NSUSC  staff;  (iii)  improved  NSUSC  technical  and  financial \nperformance;  (iv)  increased  and  more  effective  outsourcing  arrangements;  and  (v)  increased \npublic-private partnerships in water services and landfill operations.    \n \n4. \nThe outcomes under component B include (i) customer awareness and understanding of \nSCIP-supported  reforms  in  urban  service  delivery,  (ii)  increased  communication  between \nNSUSC and its customers, (iii) transparent public monitoring of service delivery, (iv) enhanced \naccountability of NSUSC to its customers, and (v) development of a customer relations system \nwithin NSUSC.  \n \nC. \n \n\nMethodologies and Key Activities \n\n1. \n\nComponent  A:  Technical,  Operational,  and  Organizational  Support  to \nNSUSC \n\n \n5. \nPart  A  of  the  Investment  Program  supports  NSUSC\u2019s  basic  technical,  planning,  and \nfinancial capacity. Component A supplements this by further developing technical, operational, \nand  organizational  capacity  to  increase  NSUSC\u2019s  efficiency  and  prepare  for  second-stage \nreforms. \n \n6. \nComponent  A  will  support  initiating  and  implementing  information-gathering  programs \nrequired under SCIP\u2019s service and asset management agreements and necessary for NSUSC\u2019s \neffective  operation.  These  are  directed  to  (i)  developing  baselines  for,  among  other  things, \nnonrevenue  water,  network  pressures,  number  of  connected  customers,  percentage  of  solid \nwaste  collected,  and  composition  of  waste;  (ii)  designing  and  implementing  improvement \nprograms in technical operations, commercial operations, and customer service;2 (iii) assisting \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program (Update). Manila. \n2  Programs  would  target,  among  others,  nonrevenue  water  reduction,  leakage  detection,  regularization  of  illegal \n\nconnections and improvement in customer complaint response times. \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nNSUSC  to  manage  and  improve  outsourcing  contracts  and  develop  improved  outsourcing \nmodels;  (iv)  providing  hands-on  training  to  NSUSC  staff  in  skills  required  for  operational \nimprovement  programs;  and  (v)  reviewing  public-private  partnership  options  for  landfill \noperations  and  water  services  provision,  including  to  recommend  preferred  options  and  build \nconsensus for implementation. \n \n\n2.  \n\nComponent  B:  Public  Awareness  and  Outreach,  Public  Monitoring,  and \nCustomer Relations \n\nCost and Financing \n\n \n7. \nCitizens\u2019  participation  is  integral  to  reforming  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  SWM \nservices  under  SCIP.  The  TA  component  will  develop  an  institutionalized  system  of  public \nawareness  and  outreach,  public  monitoring,  and  customer  relations  to  improve  NSUSC\u2019s \neffectiveness and accountability to its customers. The TA will build on consultations and public \nawareness  activities  carried  out  with  nongovernmental  and  civil  society  organizations  and \nstakeholders  during  the  preparation  phase.  Component  B  includes  support  for  (i)  public \nawareness and communication activities, (ii) citizen report card surveys, and (iii) a computerized \ncustomer  relations  and  complaints  redress  system.  NSUSC  customer  relations  units  will  be \nestablished  in  each  taluka.  Staffing  of  the  units  and  customer  relations  management  will  be \nprovided for a period of 2 years under the TA. These activities will be subsequently subsumed \nwithin  NSUSC\u2019s  operational  costs  as  NSUSC  develops.  The  public  outreach  and  customer \nrelations activities will identify specific communication needs for both men and women, as well \nas  policies  for  NSUSC  to  pursue  for  increasing  low-income  households\u2019  access  to  improved \nservices. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,900,000, with $2,500,000 equivalent from the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund and $400,000 in counterpart financing from the Government \nand  NSUSC.  Component  A  costs  total  $1,885,000,  while  those  for  component  B  come  to \n$490,000,  and  $125,000  is  budgeted  for  contingencies.  The  counterpart  contributions  include \noffice  facilities,  utilities,  administrative  support,  counterpart  staff,  secretarial  support,  supplies, \nlocal transportation, and miscellaneous training costs. Table A11 summarizes the costs.   \n \nE. \n \n9. \nThe  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for \nthe TA. NSUSC will be the Implementing Agency responsible for component A, while P&DD and \nNSUSC will be responsible for implementing their respective activities under component B. The \nSCIP\u2019s program support unit within P&DD will oversee the citizen report card subcomponent. \n \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  44  months  from  April  2009,  with  inputs  from \n10. \ninternational  and  national  consultants  hired  through  a  firm  for  each  of  the  two  components.  A \ncivil  society organization  will  be  contracted  separately  for  the  citizen  report  card  activity  under \ncomponent B. The planned level of effort for component A is 142 person-months, comprising 42 \nperson-months  of  international  inputs  and  100  person-months  of  national  inputs.  The  planned \nlevel of effort for Component B is 337 person-months in total, comprising 22 person-months of \nadvisory  inputs  (primarily  national),  312  person-months  of  customer  complaints  staff,  and  3 \nperson-months of information technology support.  \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n\fTable A11: Cost Estimates \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n69 \n\nCost ($ \u2019000) \n \n \n\nItem \n\n \nI.

The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\nA. \n\nObjectives of the Program \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe  objective  of  the  Sindh  Cities  Improvement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment \n1. \nProgram)  is  to  improve  the  quality,  coverage,  and  reliability  of  water  supply,  wastewater \nmanagement (WWM), and solid waste management (SWM) services in participating secondary \ncities. The Investment Program targets this outcome through a combination of institutional and \nsector reforms, capacity development, and priority infrastructure investments.  \n \nB. \n\nIdentification of Problems \n\nTaluka  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  are  responsible  for  municipal  services  and \n2. \nregulations.  Municipal  services  include,  among  others,  water  supply,  WWM,  and  SWM. \nHowever,  the  TMAs  lack  sufficient  organization,  capacity,  and  resources  to  deliver  such \nservices  effectively.  The  provision  of  water  supply,  WWM,  and  SWM  services  in  Sindh \nsecondary  cities  is  chaotic.  There  are  no  organized  water  supply  and  WWM  authorities,  no \nsystems for monitoring quality of service, and no maps of existing infrastructure. Data on service \ncoverage for the urban populations outside Karachi is poor, but piped-water access is estimated \nat less than 50% and the piped water is frequently contaminated. Similarly, access to sewerage \nor drainage (primarily open drains) varies considerably, but it averages around 60%. Less than \n40%  of  households  are  served  by  SWM  systems,  and  there  are  no  sanitary  landfills.  Cost \nrecovery  averages  about  30%  of  operating  and  maintenance  costs  for  water  supply  in  first-\ntranche towns, and it is negligible for WWM and SWM. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Rationale \n\nUnder \n\ninvesting \n\nthe  current \n\ninfrastructure  provision  arrangements, \n\n3. \nin  physical \ninfrastructure  will  not  bring  the  desired  service  improvements.  Physical  investments  not \naccompanied by reforms only feed a vicious cycle of inadequate service provision. Due to the \nlimited  capacity  of  the  public  sector,  municipal  service  reforms  need  to  (i)  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  efficient  service  provision  by  the  private  sector;  (ii)  promote  accountability  for \nservice delivery, not simply scheme construction; (iii) introduce a service-focused management \nmodel;  (iv)  address  key  technical  weaknesses  in  the  delivery  systems;  and  (v)  be  politically \nacceptable. \n \nPublic Sector Intervention. Based on these criteria, the initial model developed for the \n4. \nInvestment Program is a public limited corporation, formed under the Companies Ordinance Act \n1984  and  owned  by  the  participating  local  governments.  Under  tranche  1,  the  North  Sindh \nUrban  Services  Corporation  (NSUSC)  will  provide  water  supply,  WWM,  and  SWM  services \ninitially  to  a  cluster  of  six  participating  TMAs.  NSUSC  senior  management  and  technical \nsupervisors will be recruited competitively from the market.   \n \n5. \nThe  corporate  model  introduces  a  higher  level  of  accountability  for  providing  urban \nservices. While greater private sector participation (PSP) could incentivize more efficient service \ndelivery,  a  first-stage  public  sector  reform  is  necessitated  by  the  limited  capacity  to  manage \nPSP, varying political receptivity to PSP, absence of reliable data to assess and price risk, and \nembryonic  nature  of  the  private  sector  in  urban  services.  The  Investment  Program\u2019s  attached \ntechnical  assistance  will  support  PSP  transactions  to  incentivize  improved  service  provision, \nparticularly in urban water supply and SWM. \n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n71 \n\nAggregation  and  Multiple  Ownership.  The  benefits  of  grouping  several  TMAs  into  a \n6. \nsingle organization for urban service provision include economies of scale, sharing the cost of \nprofessional  management  and  systems,  and  balancing  the  interests  among  participants. \nSimilarly,  multiple  ownership  can  temper  politically  motivated  decisions,  help  professionalize \nmanagement,  and  improve  transparency  and  corporate  governance.  Participating  local \ngovernments  have  expressed  support  for  aggregating  as  shareholders  in  a  common  urban \nservices corporation. Perceived advantages include better defined TMA roles under contractual \nagreements  and  a  convenient  venue  for  TMA  joint  action.  As  the  service  and  asset \ntown \nmanagement  agreements \nrequirements, based on TMA commitment to reforms, this allows for more performance-based \nallocation of resources and discourages free-rider behavior from TMAs less willing to reform.  \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  subsector  investments  were  evaluated  for  the  water  supply, \n7. \nWWM,  and  SWM  subsectors.  For  each  participating  TMA,  the  economic  benefits  were \nevaluated only for those subsectors that will benefit from additional investment in that particular \nTMA.  Likely  benefits,  costs,  and  the  calculated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  from \nsubsector interventions for each town are described below. \n \nD. \n\n(SAMAs)  are  designed \n\nAlternative Analysis \n\nto  accommodate \n\nindividual \n\nAlternative subprojects were considered in each subsector and in each town. In all cases \n8. \nof  water  supply  and  WWM  subprojects,  the  alternatives  were  rehabilitation  of  existing \ninfrastructure  or  building  of  new  infrastructure.  Rehabilitating  existing  infrastructure  was \nregarded as the least-cost approach.  \n \n9. \nAlternatives  to  sanitary  landfills  include  incineration,  hydrolysis,  digestion,  and  gas \nplasma.  These  alternatives  are  technically  too  complex  and  their  capital  cost  too  high.  Two \nalternative  solid  waste  secondary  collection  systems  were  reviewed:  skip  hoist  vehicles  and  a \nmixed fleet of tractor-trailers, trucks, and loaders. While the capital cost of skip hoist vehicles is \nhigher,  they  were  chosen  because  they  (i)  avoid  double  handling  of  waste,  which  is  a  key \ntechnical requirement; (ii) can make more trips per day since they have higher average speed \nand much shorter loading time; (iii) are more reliable than tractor-trailers when traveling longer \ndistances;  and  (iv)  require  less  staff  to  operate.  Overall,  lower  operating  costs  offset  the \nincreased capital costs.  \n \nE. \n\nMethodology \n\n10. \nThe  economic  analysis  is  based  on  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  guidelines, \nincluding the Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997); Handbook for the Analysis of \nWater Supply Projects \u2013 Guidelines, Handbooks and Manuals (1999); and ERD Technical Note \n23: Good Practices for Estimating Reliable Willingness-to-Pay Values in the Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector (2007).  \n \n11. \nThe  economic  analysis  examined  subsector  investments  in  water  supply,  WWM,  and \nSWM by TMA in tranche 1. Investments were evaluated over a 15 to 20-year period depending \non asset life. Costs and benefits are forecast in 2008 prices. The analysis combines the Rohri \nwater supply and wastewater investments, as wastewater improvements have significant impact \non the quality of the raw water source for Rohri.  \n \n12. \nFor each subsector investment, the EIRR was calculated for the net stream of economic \nbenefits. The net economic benefit was calculated by subtracting the economic costs from the \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nGross Economic Benefits \n\ngross  economic  benefits  of  the  subprojects.  Economic  net  present  values  were  calculated  by \ndiscounting at 12%.  \n \nF. \n \n13. \nThe  contingent  valuation  method  was  used  to  evaluate  the  gross  economic  benefits. \nThis  method  was  used  since  the  willingness-to-pay  figures  capture  the  whole  spectrum  of \nbenefits  derived  by  the  consumers  from  urban  service  improvements.  To  calculate  the  gross \neconomic  benefits,  the  willingness-to-pay  figure  for  each  of  the  improved  services  was \nmultiplied by the number of consumers benefiting from these services.  \n \n14.  Willingness-to-pay  values  cover  four  main  types  of  service  provided:  (i)  24/7  water \nsupply  in  pilot  distribution  network  improvement  (DNI)  zones  (monthly  service  and  one-time \nconnection fee); (ii) regular but intermittent water supply service, with improved water quality in \nthe existing parts of the water supply network; (iii) wastewater services; and (iv) SWM services. \nThe estimated willingness to pay for 24/7 water supply service in the DNI zones was calculated \nat PRs566 per month using regression analysis based on a 2008 survey.  1 The willingness-to-\npay values for improved water service in the old network was estimated at PRs175 per month \nbased on the respondents\u2019 answers in a survey regarding provision of less-improved services. \nThe  WWM  and  SWM  willingness-to-pay  values  were  estimated  at  PRs100  and  PRs80, \nrespectively, based on social surveys in 12 Sindh secondary towns in 2006. \n \n15. \nThe  number  of  customers  benefiting  from  the  improved  services  is  equivalent  to  the \nnumber of customers assumed in the financial model (Appendix 13) during the tranche 1 period. \nUnauthorized  water  supply  customers  were  estimated  to  be  40%  of  the  starting  authorized \nwater supply customers.2 The gross economic benefit values are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nG. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n16. \nAll costs used in the analysis were actual real economic costs. The economic operating \ncosts  of  providing  the  service  are  assumed  to  be  the  benefits  customers  derive  from  that \nservice.  The  economic  operating  costs  are  based  on  nominal  financial  costs  used  in  the \nfinancial  model  deflated  to  2008  prices.  The  real  costs  were  converted  to  border  parity  prices \nusing  a  conversion  factor  of  0.75  for  labor  and  0.9  for  other  operating  costs.  The  economic \ncapital costs are based on the financial capital costs used in the investment plan, and exclude \nall  price  contingencies,  interest  costs,  taxes,  and  duties.  Details  on  economic  costs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. The details of capital expenditure are in Appendix 6. \n \nH. \n \n17. \n \n\nTable A12.1 summarizes the results of the economic analysis.  \n\nResults of the Economic Analysis \n\n                                                 \n1    Gallup  Pakistan.  2008.  Willingness-to-Pay  Survey.  Pakistan.  The  study  covers  864  households  and  commercial \nenterprises in Larkana, New  Sukkur, Rohri, and Sukkur City. Estimates for WWM and SWM are based on social \nsurveys  undertaken  by  PPTA  4534-PAK:  Sindh  Basic  Urban  Services  Corporation  (Nippon  Koei)  and  TA  4432-\nPAK: Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh (Halcrow) covering 12 towns, including 5 of 6 first-\ntranche  towns.  Commercial  willingness  to  pay  for  water  supply  and  WWM  is  assumed  twice  as  high  as  the \ndomestic willingness to pay.  \n\n2  Based on the assumption that nonrevenue water is 50%, with 30% technical losses and 20% commercial losses. \nAuthorized  and  unauthorized  consumption  are  estimated  at  50%  and  20%,  respectively,  of  water  produced. \nUnauthorized customers are estimated at 40% of authorized customers. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n73 \n\nTable A12.1: Summary of Economic Viability \n\n \nSubsector Investment \nKhairpur Water Supply \nKhairpur WWM \nKhairpur SWM \nLarkana SWM \nShikarpur SWM \nRohri Water Supply and WWM \nSukkur and New Sukkur Water Supply \nSukkur, New Sukkur and Rohri SWM \n\nNet Present Valuea \n(PRs million) \n93.63  \n11.24  \n19.27  \n153.82  \n22.89  \n11.23  \n42.69  \n107.34  \n\n \nEIRR (%) \n21.7 \n20.3 \n18.3 \n43.5 \n20.3 \n14.4 \n14.2 \n31.5 \n\n              \n\n              \n\nEIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  SWM  =  solid  waste  management,  WWM  = \nwastewater management. \na Net present value of net economic benefits discounted at 12% \n\nDistribution of Benefits \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n            \n \n18. \nOverall,  the  economic  analysis  indicates  that  all  of  the  investments  are  economically \nviable,  each  having  a  positive  EIRR  even  in  the  worst-case  sensitivity  analysis  scenario. \nLarkana  SWM  and  Sukkur,  New  Sukkur,  and  Rohri  SWM  have  high  EIRRs  due  to  significant \neconomies of scale, since they serve more than one TMA. Khairpur water supply and Shikarpur \nSWM  EIRR  values  are  robust  overall,  and  they  remain  above  the  12%  threshold  even  in  the \nworst-case  scenario.  Sukkur  and  New  Sukkur  water  supply,  Khairpur  WWM,  Khairpur  SWM, \nand  Rohri  water  supply  and  WWM  have  positive  EIRRs,  but  these  are  more  sensitive  to \nfluctuations in revenue. The results of the sensitivity analysis are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nI. \n \n19. \nThe improvements in all three services will benefit the whole of the urban population in \nthe  six  participating  TMAs.  Predictable  flows  of  quality  water  supply,  improved  wastewater \nmanagement, and increased solid water collection will have positive impacts on the health of the \npopulation, quality of life, and economic prospects in the TMAs. Both the Investment Program \nand  attached  advisory \nto  support  service \nimprovements  for  low-income  customers.  The  USCs  will  have  units  tasked  to  design  pro-poor \nsubsidies that will enable all classes of customers to avail of the improved service levels in the \nDNI  zones.  Outside  these  pilot  zones,  water  supply  will  be  supplied  at  regular  times  to  the \nconsumers and for longer duration. This water will be of higher quality since it will be filtered and \ndisinfected.  While  some  contamination  is  inevitable  due  to  intermittence  of  supply,  the  cost  of \nhousehold  treatment  will  be  reduced.  This  improvement  will  result  in  time  savings,  improved \nhealth,  and  lower  coping  costs.  It  is  estimated  that  some  households  spend  about  PRs400 \nmonthly on alternative water supplies, including for pumps, electricity, and water filtration.  \n \n21. \nThe reforms under the Investment Program are expected to have a positive effect on the \nTMA  staff  transferred  to  NSUSC.  The  deputation  will  allow  for  a  transition  without  widespread \nretrenchment.  The  staffing  of  NSUSC  can  be  rationalized  over  time  through  attrition.  Deputed \nTMA  staff  will  benefit  from  the  incentive-based  pay  in  NSUSC,  as  will  selected  TMA  staff  that \nmaintain  liaison  role  with  NSUSC  (as  planned  under  the  compensation  design).

The  analysis  includes  projections  of  NSUSC\u2019s  financial  position,  calculation  of  the \noperational and transition support funding requirement, and calculation of the financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR).  \n \nB. \n\nCurrent Situation \n\n2. \nThe accounting systems at the taluka level are weak. Financial information on costs of \ndelivering water supply, wastewater management (WWM), and solid waste management (SWM) \nservices provided by taluka municipal administrations (TMAs)2 is limited. Most expenses are not \nproperly  recorded  or  segregated  by  service.  Tariff  revenue  covers  less  than  3%  of  operating \ncosts  in  first-tranche  TMAs.  The  average  annual  cash  shortfall  for  FY2003  to  FY2006  was \nPRs185  million,  largely  comprising  staff  costs.3  The  current  structure  of  TMAs\u2019  urban  services \nprovision  is  not  financially  viable.  Supplementary  Appendix  M  elaborates  on  financial \nmanagement concerns at the TMA level. \n \nC. \n\nMethodology and Core Assumptions \n\nThe financial analysis, expressed in local currency and nominal prices, uses an accrual \n3. \naccounting-based financial model of NSUSC. The model calculates NSUCS\u2019s projected income, \ncash flows, and balance sheets. It estimates an FIRR for operations in first-tranche towns over \nthe  Investment  Program\u2019s  10-year  period,  from  FY2009  to  FY2018.  The  financial  model \nassumes  NSUSC  is  responsible for  operation, repair,  and maintenance  costs  of  the  municipal \nassets,  and  it  includes  depreciation  on  municipal  assets.4  Capital  investment  and  operating \ncosts are adjusted for inflation. The assumptions used for modeling NSUSC operations in each \nsubsector are detailed in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n4. \nThe model assumes inflation of 13% in FY2009, gradually decreasing to 6%. Household \nwater consumption is assumed at 136 liters per capita per day, which is consistent with average \nwater consumption in the region. Current monthly tariffs of PRs10\u2013PRs30 are retained for those \ncustomers not residing in a distribution network improvement (DNI) zone. Those customers with \nsignificantly  improved  service  in  the  DNI  zones  are  assumed  to  pay  upwards  of  PRs250\u2013\nPRs300  per  month  once  improved  services  commence.  The  assumed  tariffs  for  DNI  zones \nremain  lower  than  estimated  willingness-to-pay  values  in  Sindh,  and  they  are  comparable  to \nactual costs of water from alternative sources. Collection rates are based on actual performance \nbut are assumed to improve over time. Similarly, nonrevenue water is assumed initially at 50% \nand to gradually decrease to 20% by FY2018. Electricity cost is calculated according to water \ndelivered,  pumping  pressure,  and  a  unit  cost  of  PRs7  per  kilowatt-hour.  The  model  assumes \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  First-tranche TMAs comprise Khairpur, Larkana, New Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, and Sukkur City. During program \n\npreparation, 12 TMAs were examined. \n\n3  Electricity  costs  are  reportedly  high,  but  billing  lacks  transparency.  Given  the  absence  of  proper  financial \n\naccounting systems for expenses other than staff, the amount of this expense is significantly understated. \n\n4  Under  the  service  and  asset  management  agreements  to  be  signed  between  NSUSC  and  each  TMA,  the  TMA \n\nretains ownership of existing and new assets, while NSUSC will manage them. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n75 \n\nwastewater generation at 70% of water consumed, and it introduces a modest wastewater tariff \nof PRs50 per month starting from FY2012. Waste generation is estimated at 0.54 kg per capita \nper day. The model assumes introduction of a modest tariff at PRs50 per month from FY2013 \nthat is timed for full operation of a collection and disposal system. \n \nD. \n\nResults of Financial Projections for NSUSC \n\n5. \nNSUSC\u2019s projected net loss before depreciation over the period ending with FY2012 is \nPRs776  million  ($10  million),  but  NSUSC  performance  gradually  improves  as  tariff  revenue \nincreases with improved services (such as by the introduction of DNI zones under tranche 1).5 \nNSUSC is expected to cover its operating cash outflows from its own tariff revenues by FY2017 \n(Figure A13), assuming the Government covers deputed TMA staff costs.6 Cash flow coverage \nfor  water  supply  services  is  reached  in  FY2013.  Cash  flow  coverage  for  SWM  and  WWM  is \nmuch lower. NSUSC will require continuing subsidies to cover WWM and SWM services so long \nas  tariffs  lag  behind  cost  recovery  levels.  A  summary  of  NSUSC  income  and  cash  flow \nstatements is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\nFigure A13: NSUSC Operating Cashflows\u2013Consolidated \n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n\u00a0\n.\ns\nR\nP\n\n1,000\n\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n\u2010\n\nJan\u201009\n\nJan\u201011\n\nJan\u201010\nCash\u00a0Inflows\u00a0\u2010\u00a0NSUSC\nGovernment\u00a0Grants\u00a0for\u00a0Staff\u00a0Costs\n\nJan\u201013\n\nJan\u201012\n\nJan\u201014\n\nJan\u201015\n\nJan\u201016\n\nJan\u201017\n\nJan\u201018\n\nTotal\u00a0Operating\u00a0Costs\u00a0\u2010\u00a0NSUSC\n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \nE. \n\nOperations and Transition Support Funding \n\n6. \nThe  model  estimates  NSUSC  will  require  funding  of  about  PRs618  million  ($8  million) \nunder part D of the Investment Program during its initial operating period from FY2009\u2013FY2012. \nOver the remaining 7 years and four tranches, the projected cash shortfall is PRs1.3 billion ($17 \nmillion). NSUSC is expected not to require any operations and transition support funding from \nFY2017 onward. Continuing grants from the Government of Sindh for deputed TMA staff costs \n\n                                                 \n5  NSUSC revenues include the annual government grant for deputed TMA staff salaries and benefits, which ranges \n\nfrom PRs117 million to PRs270 million ($1.5 million to $3.5 million) over the 10-year projection period. \n6  Deputed TMA staff totals over 1800 persons, primarily street sweepers and staff in grade 5 or below. \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nare assumed in these projections. Overall operating performance can be substantially improved \nover these projections if NSUSC can rationalize deputed TMA staff numbers and the skills mix, \nparticularly  in  SWM.  Of  over  1,800  current  municipal  service  employees,  some  75%  are \nsweepers and account for about three quarters of the deputed TMA staff expense.  \n \nF. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) \n\n7. \nBasic  assumptions  used  in  computing  the  FIRR  are  as  follow:  (i)  project  investment \ncosts are derived from estimated costs less price contingencies and interest during construction; \n(ii) capital expenditures are recorded at the time they are incurred; (iii) interest and depreciation \nare excluded; (iv) real operating cash flows are used; and (v) residual value of asset additions in \n2018  are  regarded  as  a  benefit.  The  calculated  FIRR  for  NSUSC  is  5.2%  (Supplementary \nAppendix G). This is higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 3.92% (Table \nA13.1).  The  calculated  FIRR  values  for  various  scenarios  are  as  follow:  (i)  4.18%  with  a  10% \ndecrease in revenue, (ii) 4.32% with a 10% increase in costs, and (iii) 3.58% with a combined \n10%  decrease  in  revenue  and  10%  increase  in  costs.  Overall,  the  Investment  Program  is \nprojected to be financially viable at proposed tariff levels and under most scenarios.  \n \n\nTable A13.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Calculations \n\nItem \n\nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nInflation \nReal Cost \nWeighted Component of WACC \nWACC \n\nOCR \n\n262.0 \n\n65.5% \n4.4%a \n1.2%d \n3.2% \n2.1% \n3.9% \n\nADF \n\n38.0 \n\n9.5% \n1.4%b \n1.2% \n0.2% \n0.0% \n\n \n\nGovernment \n\n100.0 \n\n25.0% \n14.7%c \n7.5%e \n7.2% \n1.8% \n\n \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na London interbank offered rate US dollar 10-year rate of 4.21% plus spread of 20 basis points. \nb Average interest rate based on loan conditions for ADF. \nc Karachi interbank offered rate 3-year bond rate. \nd Average international cost escalation forecasts by ADB for 2006\u20132010. \ne Average domestic cost escalation forecasts by ADB for 2006\u20132010. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nG. \n\nTariff Assumptions and Affordability \n\nTariff Assumptions \n\n1. \n \n8. \nTariff  assumptions  are  based  on  existing  tariff  schedules  and  on  data  from  a  recent \nwater  supply  willingness-to-pay  (WTP)  survey  conducted  in  Khairpur,  New  Sukkur,  Rohri,  and \nSukkur.7 Regression analysis of the data set found a mean WTP of PRs566 per month and a \nmean WTP for a one-time connection charge of PRs3,620.  \n \n9. \nThe  model  assumes  a  tariff  of  PRs250\u2013PRs300  per  month  for  water  supply  to \nhouseholds in  DNI  zones.

Based on the available information, the median household income in urban \nareas  of  tranche  1  TMAs  is  estimated  at  PRs8,241  per  month.  At  the  start  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  the  expected  monthly  charge  for  water  will  range  from  PRs10  to  PRs30  per  month \n(with no charge for other services), or 0.12% to 0.36% of household income. In fiscal year 2012, \nthe  highest  expected  monthly  bill,  if  all  three  services  were  included,  would  be  PRs400  per \nmonth,  which  equates  to  4.8%  of  median  household  income.  This  is  below  the  generally \naccepted  benchmark  of  5%  for  affordability  of  utility  services.  Findings  from  the  recent  WTP \nsurvey,  however,  do  show  some  variance  in  WTP  levels  between  TMAs,  necessitating  user \ncharge schemes tailored to TMAs\u2019 needs. The WTP survey also highlighted, though, that some \nhouseholds in North Sindh pay in excess of PRs3509 per month for self-provision of water from \nwells  and  other  sources,  with  Sukkur  City  households  surveyed  bearing  monthly  expenses  of \nabout  PRs525  for  access  to  water  sourced  from  wells.  The  Investment  Program  will  support \nestablishment  of  a  low-income  consumer  unit  within  NSUSC  to  focus  on  adapting  pricing \nschemes and service provision to the needs of the urban poor. \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2004.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nSindh  Cities  Improvement  Investment  Program  (SCIP)  is  a  10-year,  $300  million  program  under  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility to fund basic urban infrastructure improvements in Sindh\u2019s secondary towns through (i) establishing local government-\nowned, professionally managed urban services corporations; (ii) support for urban sector reforms and capacity development; \nand (iii) priority investment in water supply, wastewater, and solid waste management (SWM) infrastructure. The investments, \nalong  with  institutional  reforms  and  capacity  development  to  improve  service  delivery,  are  consistent  with  the  poverty \nreduction strategies of the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The country\u2019s Poverty Reduction \nStrategy  Paper  (PRSP  2003),a  the  2005  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF  2005\u20132010),  the  Vision  2030 \napproved  in  2007,  and  the  upcoming  PRSP  II  together  identify  accelerating  economic  growth,  improving  governance  and \ndevolution, human development, and targeting the poor and vulnerable as key to poverty reduction efforts. Improved water, \nsanitation, and health are recognized as core elements of human development. The MTDF prioritizes investments in several \nareas,  including  balanced  rural  and  urban  development,  upgrading  physical  infrastructure,  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs),  and  supporting  private  sector  development.  All  these  are  relevant  for  the  SCIP.  The  PRSP-II \ndraft  summary  document  confirms  its  alignment  to  this  MTDF.  The  PRSP  II  itself  \u201cpresents  a  strategy  to  ensure  that  the \ngrowth is broad-based and leads to effective poverty reduction.\u201d It focuses on (i) public-private partnerships for infrastructure \ndevelopment,  (ii)  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  as  engines  of  growth,  and  (iii)  improved  service  delivery.  Again,  all  are \nrelevant to the SCIP. \n \nADB  is  finalizing  a  new  country  partnership  strategy  (2008\u20132012)  focused  on  (i)  reforms  and  investment  in  major \ninfrastructure sectors, (ii) second generation reforms to strengthen governance and services to promote structural change, (iii) \ndevelopment  of  the  urban  and  rural  economy  for  balanced  development,  and  (iv)  effective  implementation  for  development \neffectiveness and results. SCIP is fully consistent with this new strategy, as it introduces reforms, capacity development, and \npriority  infrastructure  investment  while  adhering  to  Government  of  Sindh\u2019s  and  national  poverty  reduction  priorities. \nImprovements in  water supply,  wastewater, and SWM infrastructure and services  will positively  influence health, education, \nsocial,  economic,  and  environment  outcomes.  These  are  critical  to  achieving  poverty  reduction.  Improved  services  will \npositively affect the health of young children, who disproportionately suffer from life-threatening water- and sanitation-related \ndiseases and benefit women whose time is spent caring for the sick and collecting water for households. The improved living \nenvironment will enhance the quality of life of all residents, having wider impacts on public and environmental health. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nSindh  Province  is  Pakistan\u2019s  second  largest  economy  and  second  most  populous  province  after  Punjab.  Its  population  is \nabout 36 million, and, since 2003, it has recorded average growth of about 7.0%.b The poverty headcount ratio has declined \nfrom 31% in FY2002 to about 20% in FY2007. Another source indicates poverty in Pakistan has declined from 34.5% in 2001 \nto 23.9% in 2005c in the  wake of overall economic growth and increased pro-poor government spending. However, 70% of \nthe  population  remains  vulnerable  to  poverty  in  the  long  run.  The  income  and  expenditure  gaps  between  the  poor  and  the \nwealthier  strata  have  widened  considerably.  Poverty  in  Pakistan  is  now  recognized  not  simply  as  an  income-related \nphenomena but also being reflected in deprivation of key quality of life opportunities as  well as feelings of vulnerability and \npowerlessness.  The  poor  tend  to  have  larger  households  and  less  access  to  essential  assets  and  services,  including \nelectricity,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  cooking  gas.  Poverty  is  clearly  associated  with  landlessness  and  small  land \nholdings, as well as lack of literacy and educational attainment. \n \nLarge-scale migration to Karachi has resulted in Sindh having the highest urban population, at nearly 50%, compared to 33% \nfor Pakistan as a whole. The evaluation of Sindh\u2019s constraints, opportunities, and development strategies needs to take into \naccount the urban-rural divide in the province. \n \nWhile urban Sindh, as a  whole, is the least deprived area nationally, it is estimated that one fourth of these urban areas of \nSindh fall into the category of high deprivation (from a scale of low-medium-high).d This is indicative of the gap in development \nbetween Karachi (where 60% of the urban population lives) and other urban centers. Urban poverty in the subproject towns is \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n79 \n\nmultifaceted, ranging from lack of employment to deficiencies in basic urban services, to substandard housing. The poverty \nlevels  of  towns  in  the  program  areas  are  around  40%\u201350%.e  Significant  disparity  exists  between  more  developed \nneighborhoods and the so-called katchi abadis (or slum areas). \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  contribute  to  improved  health  and  quality  of  life  for  the  population  of  Sindh,  in  line  with  MDG \ntargets for access to improved water supply and sanitation. MDG7 (target 10) aims to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people \nwithout access to safe drinking  water and basic sanitation. SCIP aims to improve quality, continuity, and coverage of water \nsupply,  wastewater,  and  SWM  services  by  incentivizing  and  supporting  effective  management  and  sustainable  financing  of \nurban  services  providers.  The  Investment  Program  will  have  a  indirect  impact  on  poverty  reduction  and  will  support \ninstitutional reforms for improving the enabling environment for pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. \nThe targeting classification is deemed to be a general intervention. \n \n2.  Design Features \nPro-poor  elements  of  the  service  provision  are  to  be  agreed  between  the  taluka  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  and  the \nTMA-owned urban services corporation (USC) and will be set out in the service and asset management agreements between \neach TMA and the USC. SCIP aims to create proper incentives for improved basic urban services delivery and to establish a \nsustainable approach for providing these services. Pro-poor measures to be adopted include:   \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\naiming for 80% coverage in poor communities and other service areas in general;  \nestablishing a specialized low-income consumer unit to expand access to the urban poor; \nestablishing  mechanisms  (subsidies,  exemptions,  or  payments  in  installments)  to  ensure  poor,  disabled,  or \nvulnerable households are not excluded from access by an inability to pay one-off, upfront connection charges;  \nsetting up mechanisms for holding the service provider accountable for service delivery to the poor;  \ndeveloping a transparent method for setting connection fees and tariffs; and \nensuring consumers have a voice in service delivery through a properly designed complaint system. \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \nn/a \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nIt is estimated SCIP will eventually cover a population of around 4 million in some 20 TMAs. The first tranche of the program \nwill cover the urban population of a cluster of cities in interior Sindh\u2014Khairpur, Larkana, New Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, and \nSukkur\u2014estimated  to  be  approximately  1,222,400  (based  on  the  1998  population  census  and  with  3.2%  per  annum \npopulation growth from 1998\u20132008). The population is ethnically diverse. It is dominated by Sindhi, followed by Baluch, Urdu-\nspeaking Muhajors, and Punjabis. The remaining population is made up of religious minorities, including upper class Hindus \n(Lohana,  Bania,  and  Thakurs),  schedule  cast  Hindus  (Bheel,  Meghwar,  and  Kolhi),  and  Christians.  Poverty  is  widespread. \nMost of the people living below the poverty line are landless, unemployed, and have very limited access to basic services.  \n \nAccording to Government statistics (footnote c), about  34% of the population  in the program cities  has  access to tap  water \nsupplies (varying from 18% to 73%) and around 77% has access to  flushing latrines (varying from 57% to 92%). However, \nthese  water supplies are intermittent (only 2\u20133 hours of service per day) and unsafe for drinking. Around 70% of the urban \npopulation of Sindh (including Karachi and Hyderabad) has access to underground sewerage and covered drainage systems \n(footnote c). In most participating towns, however, open drains are used to carry wastewater, including human excrement, at \nlane level. At main streets sewers carry wastewater up to sewage pumping stations. However, these systems suffer from poor \nmaintenance  and  are  often  blocked  up  with  garbage.  Only  38%  of  the  urban  population  of  Sindh  (including  Karachi  and \nHyderabad) is served by municipal SWM services, a further 23% is served by privately run services,while the remaining 39% \nhave no service.  \n\nA  social  audit  measuring  the  impact  of  decentralization  on  social  services  found  only  23%  of  all  respondents  in  urban  and \nrural areas of Sindh were satisfied with government water supply. A project preparatory technical assistance socioeconomic \nsurvey  found  that  82%  of  respondents  in  katchi  abadis  and  41%  of  respondents  in  pacci  abadis  (or  better-off  areas)  in \nKhairpur  were  dissatisfied  with  the  current  water  supply.  Ninety-one  percent  of  households  from  katchi  abadis  and  84%  of \nhouseholds from pacci abadis in this area were dissatisfied  with the current sewerage system. Over 90% of all households \nwere dissatisfied with the SWM service. Surveyed households demonstrated a willingness to pay both initial contributions and \nmonthly charges for water supply, wastewater, and SWM services.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder consultations were held throughout the design stage in a total of 14 TMAs. At provincial level, several workshops \nwere held with provincial government departments, local government officials, community stakeholders, and nongovernment \norganizations.  At  taluka  level,  focus  group  discussions  involved  representatives  of  schools;  labor,  women,  and  religious \ngroups; and the business sector. The meetings were held to share information and solicit advice on reforms and investments \nand  as  to  how  SCIP  can  address  their  interests.  A  socioeconomic  survey  helped  to  augment  information  collected  during \nconsultations,  including  willingness  to  pay  for  services.  This  consultation  and  survey  covered  seven  TMAs  across  interior \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nSindh  (Badin,  Dadu,  Islamkot,  Khairpur,  Mithi,  Nausharo  Feroz,  and  Sanghar),  areas  considered  for  initial  project-financed \nimprovements earlier in the design cycle. A stakeholder identification and consultation process was simultaneously carried out \nunder TA 4432-PAK: Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh to develop broad consensus on policies and \ntariff-setting for water, sanitation, and SWM services. Six TMAs were covered, and their case studies assess the water and \nsanitation  situation  in  Sindh\u2019s  interior  cities.  Support  for  investment  and  reforms  in  these  services  were  welcomed  by  the \npublic in Johi, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, New Sukkur, Shikarpur, Sukkur TMA, and Umerkot. \n \nAs project preparation developed and the current design of SCIP emerged, additional consultations were held in North Sindh \nand  tranche  1  towns.  Taluka  councils  were  consulted  multiple  times  and  passed  resolutions  to  participate  in  SCIP.  Public \nconsultations indicate broad support for the combination of reforms and investment. Further willingness-to-pay surveying was \ndone in 2008 following ADB guidelines.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n  Empowerment \n\n \nA  program  for  public  awareness  and  outreach  will  be  carried  out  under  SCIP.  A  strategy  for  public  awareness,  customer \nmonitoring, and customer care will be developed and implemented. For safeguards requirements, consultations will be carried \nout  as  set  out  under  the  safeguard  plans  and  frameworks.  Stakeholder  consultations  will  be  carried  out  for  subsequent \ntranches of the multitranche financing facility. \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nThere is no C&P plan, as development of consultation and participation activities will be carried out under component B of the \nadvisory technical assistance on public awareness. This will include further discussions with nongovernment and civil society \norganizations and other stakeholders. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.  Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues \n \nPakistan  ranks  very  low  in  the  Gender  Development  Index  of  2008  (152  out  of  156  countries),  and  significant  social  and \neconomic  gender  inequalities  exist.  Women  are  disproportionately  affected  by  unemployment,  earn  lower  wages,  generally \nhave no control or consent over the money they earn, and have limited access to credit. Despite women\u2019s legal right to own \nand inherit property, few  women have access and control over these resources. Female literacy in Pakistan is around 38% \ncompared  with  65%  for  men.  Only  35%  of  females  have  completed  primary  education  or  higher,  compared  to  56%  of  men \n(footnote c). Labor force participation rates for all ages are 51% for men, compared to 29% for women. Participation rates for \nmen and women from age 30 to 50 are about 97% and 52%, respectively.f Seventy-three percent of urban expectant women \nhad prenatal checkups, and only 38% of urban mothers had a postnatal consultation within 6 weeks after delivery.  \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in interior Sindh towns. This shows gender \ngaps  in  employment,  income,  education  and  decision  making.  Women,  particularly  in  low-income  communities,  face \nmultifaceted poverty. While women in program towns are involved in a range of economic activities, including cotton picking, \nwheat  threshing,  sugarcane  cutting,  teaching,  and  employment  in  office  jobs,  they  work  primarily  as  homemakers.  They \nspend several hours a day fetching, carrying, and storing water for household chores and domestic tasks, including preparing \nmeals,  washing  clothes,  cleaning  the  house  and  latrines,  etc.  For  this  reason,  poor  quality  water  and  unreliable  delivery  of \nwater supply services directly impact women. Lack of adequate sanitation facilities and garbage disposal services also place \nextra burden on women. The high incidence of water- and sanitation-related disease negatively impacts on women who are \nresponsible for nursing sick family members.  \n \nThe program will directly and indirectly benefit men and women in the participating towns of Sindh Province. Improvements in \nthe quality, coverage, and reliability of water supply, sewerage, and SWM services will have a particularly positive impact on \nwomen  in  program  areas.  As  women  are  the  primary  users  of  these  basic  urban  services,  gender  concerns  will  be \nmainstreamed  in  the  customer  complaint  mechanisms;  community  outreach  and  consultations;  public  accountability \nmechanisms;  and  urban  service  company  governance.

The  MFF  appraisal  will  include  the \nappraisal  of  the  first  loan  tranche  supporting  urban  planning,  institutional  reforms,  program \nimplementation  support,  plus  complementary  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  urban  areas  of  Khairpur,  Larkana,  New  Sukkur,  Rohri, \nShikarpur, and Sukkur.  \n \n2. \nThe sanitary landfill subprojects under tranche 1 are anticipated to have non-severe land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. Three short land acquisition and resettlement plans \n(LARPs) and one land acquisition and resettlement due diligence report (LARDDR) have been \nprepared for three sites. No LAR impacts are anticipated for the water supply and wastewater \nsubprojects  under  tranche  1.  The  potential  LAR  impact  of  subprojects  under  tranches  2\u20135 \ncannot  as  yet  be  ascertained.  However,  subprojects  will  be  similar  to  those  in  tranche  1  and \nsubject  to  the  provisions  of  the  LARF  prepared  for  the  Investment  Program.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) will not be triggered by the Investment Program. \n \nB. \n \nLAR  measures  under  the  Investment  Program  will  follow  the  applicable  laws  and \n3. \nregulations of Pakistan and Sindh Province, as well as ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement  Policy \n(1995) and Operations Manual (OM) Section F2/OP & BP 2006. The appraisal of the MFF and \neach tranche and the approval of each subproject with LAR impacts will require preparation of \nthe following documents: \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  LARF  for  the  MFF  applicable  to  all  subprojects.  The  existing  LARF  will  be \nreviewed, if necessary, updated, and resubmitted for ADB and the Government\u2019s \napproval as a condition to approve each new tranche under the MFF. \nThe initial poverty and  social assessment for each of the Investment  Program\u2019s \ntranches,  indicating  if  LAR  impacts  are  likely  to  occur,  their  type,  likely \nmagnitude, and whether any indigenous peoples may be affected.  \nFor each subproject under a tranche requiring LAR, either a LARDDR or a LARP \nbased  on  detailed  design.  The  LARDDR,  to  be  prepared  for  subprojects  where \nthe  ADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  will  not  be  triggered  (para.  5),  will \nprovide  detailed  information  on  how  land  has  been  acquired.  The  LARP,  to  be \nprepared when the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement is triggered, will detail \nthe compensation and/or rehabilitation plan to be implemented before civil works \nbegin.  \n\n \nAs  per  ADB  policy  and practice,  the  MFF,  each  tranche appraisal,  and  the  approval  of \n\n4. \nthe start of a subproject\u2019s civil works will be based on the following LAR-related conditionalities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe MFF and first-tranche appraisal: Conditional to the preparation of (a) a LARF \nfor  the  MFF  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  (b)  separate  LARPs  and/or  due  diligence \nreports for all subprojects requiring LAR included in tranche 1. \nFollowing  tranche  appraisals:  Conditional  to  (a)  review  and/or  update  LARF  (if \nnecessary),  and  (b)  preparation  for  each  project  with  LAR  of  a  LARP  and/or \nLARDDR fitting the revised LARF. \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n83 \n\n \nC.  \n \n5. \n\n(iii) \n\nProvision of notice to proceed to the subproject contractors: Conditional to the full \nimplementation  of  the  LARP  for  each  relevant  subproject.  Such  a  condition  will \nbe  clearly  explained  in  the  text  of  the  civil  works  contract,  including  satisfactory \nrehabilitation  of  all  private,  communal,  and  public  infrastructures  that  may  be \ndamaged during the course of the subproject\u2019s implementation. \n\nLand Acquisition Modalities and Application of ADB Policy \n\nThere are two modes for land acquisition available under the Investment Program: \n(i) \n\nMode  1:  acquisition  of  unoccupied  Government-owned  land  for  a  negotiated \nprice or agreed transfer arrangements between the parties concerned; and \nMode  2:  involuntary  land  acquisition  under  the  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894, \nthrough  the  provincial  Board  of  Revenue  and/or  the  district\u2019s  land  acquisition \ncollector (LAC) concerned.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n6. \nMode 1 is adopted for the acquisition of land for facilities and neither requires the right of \neminent  domain  nor  triggers  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  Mode  2  is  subject  to  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  LARPs  as  required  under  ADB  policy  and  indicated  in \nsection D.  \n \nBased  on  the  above,  ADB  will  approve  the  selection  of  subprojects  with  land  acquired \n7. \nunder mode 1 based on a LARDDR clearly documenting (i) government ownership of the land; \nand (ii) evidence that the acquired plot is not rented, encroached, or encumbered.  \n\nLARP Preparation and Implementation \n\n \nD. \n \n8. \nProject-specific  resettlement  issues  have  been  addressed  to  assist  non-titled  persons \nand  bridge  the  gap  between  existing  practice  and  the  main  guidelines  of  the  ADB  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  To  reconcile  inconsistencies  between  the  Pakistan  Land  Acquisition \nAct  of  1894  and  the  ADB  policy,  the  Government  of  Sindh  has  drafted  a  LARF  for  the \nInvestment  Program  guiding  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  LARPs.  It  ensures \ncompensation  at  replacement  cost  of  all  adverse  impacts  and  the  provision  of  subsidies  or \nallowances  for  affected  households  that  may  be  relocated,  suffer  business  losses,  or  be \nvulnerable or severely affected. \n \n9. \nof affected persons (APs), as outlined in the entitlement matrix in Table A15. \n\nLARF Eligibility and Entitlements.

As  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  Executing  Agency,  Sindh\u2019s \nPlanning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD)  will  have  responsibility  for  overall  strategy, \ntechnical  appraisal,  and  provision  of  counterpart  finances,  including  LAR  finances.  P&DD  will \noversee  the  subprojects\u2019  compliance  with  the  LARF  through  a  program  support  unit  (PSU). \nConcerning land acquisition and resettlement, the PSU will be entrusted with tranche appraisal \ncoordination,  interagency  liaison,  internal  monitoring,  and  finance  administration.  LARP \npreparation  functions  will  be  initiated  by  PSU  until  each  urban  services  corporation  (USC)  is \nsufficiently established. Land acquisition and resettlement tasks within the PSU  will be carried \nout  by  a  qualified  safeguards  officer,  reporting  to  the  PSU  program  director.  Under  the  first \ntranche of the Investment Program, the North Sindh Urban Services Company (NSUSC) will be \nestablished,  and  in  the  context  of  the  Investment  Program,  will  function  as  an  implementing \nagency.1  \n \n11.  When NSUSC capacity for LAR is sufficiently established,2 NSUSC will assume from the \nPSU the LAR implementation tasks under Parts B and C of the Investment Program, including \nsocial  and  environmental  safeguards  tasks  assigned  to  a  safeguards  cell  within  NSUSC  or \nanother USC. The safeguards cell will be responsible for the preparation and implementation of \nall LAR-related tasks, including updating the LARF (if needed), preparing and implementing the \nLARPs,  carrying  out  liaison  functions  with  the  district  revenue  offices  and  other  relevant \ngovernment  offices,  handling  first-instance  compliance  and  grievances,  and  delivering  all \ncompensation and assistance for non-land, crops, or trees losses to the APs. The district officer \n(revenue),  as  the  LAC,  and  local-level  revenue  staff  (Mukhtiarkar  at  the  taluka  level  and \nTapardar at the tapa level) verify and validate LARPs and compensation rates and deliver to the \nAPs compensation for land, crop, and tree losses. Various provincial government line agencies \ndetermine  compensation  rates  different  from  land.  The  office  of  the  taluka  nazim  will  play  a \ncoordinating role and the elected taluka councilors will represent the rights of the local citizens \non grievance committees. \n \n12. \nDisclosure and Public Consultation. APs as well as relevant government agencies will \nbe involved in consultations on APs\u2019 needs and preferences for compensation or rehabilitation \nmeasures. Key information in the LARF, including the entitlement matrix, will be translated into \nSindhi and disclosed to APs in the NSUSC, other USC, TMA, and local unions council offices. A \nSindhi  information  pamphlet  summarizing  the  LARP  will  be  provided  to  all  APs  requiring \ntranslation. An information pamphlet summarizing the LARF in Sindhi will be made available to \nthe communities. \n\n                                                 \n1  Under  subsequent  Investment  Program  tranches,  similar  urban  services  corporations  (USCs)  will  be  established \n\nand will assume the same responsibilities for LAR.  \n\n2  The  NSUSC  safeguards  cell  will  be  set  up  within  the  initial  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  supported \nintermittently  by  an  international  resettlement  consultant.  Social  and  environmental  safeguards  tasks  will  be \nassigned to this safeguards cell under the capital works unit, comprising two permanent staff experienced in land \nacquisition and resettlement and environmental protection. \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n \n13. \nGrievance  Procedure.  Initially,  an  aggrieved  AP  will  address  the  safeguards  cell  of \nNSUSC or other USC, whose officers will strive for an informal settlement within 10 days from \nlodging of the complaint. If the complaint cannot be settled, the grievance will be referred to the \nGrievance Committee comprising the Mukhtiarkar and Tapadar of the relevant taluka and tapa, \nthe elected taluka councilor of the respective tapa, the Taluka officer infrastructure and services \nof the concerned TMA, the social safeguards officer of the safeguards cell of NSUSC or other \nUSC, as  well as the social safeguards consultant hired under the Investment Program. Within \n30  days  the  committee  will  discuss  the  matter  and  refer  land  and  crop  compensation  related \ngrievances to the LAC and/or district officer (revenue), or grievances pertaining to all other types \nof assets and incomes to the NSUSC or other USC safeguards cell, and obtain a resolution. If \nthe complaint still remains unresolved, it can be re-lodged by the AP within 1 month of the LAC \nor safeguards cell decision with the Grievance Committee, which refers it to the management of \nNSUSC,  or  subsequent  USC.  The  AP  must  produce  all  relevant  documents  supporting  his  or \nher claim. The Management of NSUSC or other USC, will rule on the issue(s) within 21 days of \nits re-lodging with the Grievance Committee. The NSUSC\u2019s or other USC\u2019s decision must be in \ncompliance with the provisions of the LARF. If the grievance redress mechanism fails to satisfy \nthe aggrieved AP, he or she can submit the case to the appropriate court of law as set out in \nsections 18 to 22 of the Land Acquisition Act (1894). \n \n14.  Monitoring and Evaluation. NSUSC, or subsequent USC, assisted by the design and \nsupervision  consultant,  will  monitor  LARP  implementation  internally  and  report  to  ADB  in \nquarterly project implementation reports. An external monitoring organization will be tasked with \nexternal  monitoring  (once,  if  subproject  LARP  implementation  is  under  6  months,  biannually \notherwise) as well as post-project evaluation. It will provide external monitoring reports as well \nas an evaluation report to the USC, P&DD\u2019s program support unit, and ADB.  \n \n15. \nFinances and Schedules. The LARF mandates that each LARP will provide a detailed \nbudget and a schedule linking LAR tasks and disbursement of compensation with the initiation \nof civil works. \n \nE. \n \n16. \nIndigenous  people,  i.e.  tribal  communities,  existing  outside  the  cultural  and  legal \nmainstream  of  Pakistan  society,  are  not  present  in  the  area  of  the  Investment  Program. \nTherefore, the ADB Policy on Indigenous People will not be triggered by the subprojects under \nthe Investment Program. \n \nF. \n \n17. \nand Shikarpur.
