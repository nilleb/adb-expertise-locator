AEM  will  allow  accounting  for  every  unit  of  power \nconsumed,  which  is  essential  to  minimize  commercial  losses  and  identify  upgrades  that  will \nlower  technical  losses.  The  project  will  help  improve  energy  efficiency,  reduce  commercial \nlosses, and improve the efficiency of electricity revenue collection.2\n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  economy  has  sustained  high  growth,  averaging  8.5%  since  2006.  Growth  in  2011 \n3. \nand  beyond  is  expected  to  remain  at  8%\u20139%.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  prioritizes \nmodernizing  industry  and  developing  infrastructure  and  the  private  sector.  Reliable  and \naffordable electricity supply is vital to achieving these goals. \n \n4. \nThe  country  is  one  of  the  most  energy-intensive  in  the  world,  with  one  of  the  highest \nelectricity  consumption  rates.3 High  energy  intensity  and  electricity  consumption relative  to  the \nsize of economy mean that even a slight improvement in energy efficiency could have a great \neconomic  impact.  Promoting  energy  efficiency  is  a  strategic  priority  for  Uzbekistan  and  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB),4\n as it is the least-cost low-carbon solution to sustaining energy \nsecurity. Energy efficiency eases high energy intensity and improves energy productivity. \n \nThe  efficient  use  of  electricity  can  be  promoted  by  accounting  for  every  unit  of  power \n5. \nconsumed.  Minimizing  commercial  losses  and  identifying  upgrades  that  will  lower  technical \nlosses will help improve energy efficiency. Uzbekistan suffers high transmission and distribution \nlosses. The state joint stock company Uzbekenergo, a vertically integrated utility fully owned by \nthe government, estimates total system losses of up to nearly 20%: 2%\u20134% in transmission and \n13%\u201315%  in  distribution.  This  is  nearly  four  times  the  5%  losses  experienced  in  advanced \ncountries,  and  actual  losses  are  thought  to  be  higher,  with  commercial  losses  in  the  range  of \n25%\u201335%.  As  total  annual  power  supply  in  Uzbekistan  is  51,935  gigawatt-hours,  reducing \nlosses by 1% would annually save 520 gigawatt-hours, worth $26 million. \n \n6. \nUzbekistan\u2019s electrification rate is almost 100%. All connections are metered and billed \naccording  to  tariffs  set  for  consumer  categories.  But  the  electricity  meters\u2014electromechanical \ndevices that were manufactured during 1960\u20131990\u2014are generally old and unreliable. They are \nstill  in  service  well  beyond  their  designed  economic  life  without  recalibration  for  accuracy, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Advanced Electricity  Metering  Project.  Manila  (TA7740-UZB,  for  $1.0 million,  approved  on  17 \nDecember). \n\n3  In 2008, Uzbekistan was the second most energy-intensive country in the world, when measured by total primary \nenergy supply per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) (tons of oil equivalent per unit of GDP at purchasing power \nparity, measured in constant 2000 US dollars). It has the ninth-highest electricity consumption in the world, when \nmeasured by electricity consumption per unit of GDP (kilowatt-hour per unit of GDP, measured in constant 2000 \nUS dollars). (International Energy Agency. 2010. Energy Balances of Non-OECD Countries. Paris.) \n\n4  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n\n\fmaking it difficult for Uzbekenergo to account for electricity use. They are also easy to tamper \nwith. \n \n7. \nA  shortage  of  meter-reading  personnel  means  that  not  all  meters  are  regularly  read. \nCustomers  read  their meters themselves  but  sometimes  underreport  their  consumption.  Meter \nreaders (or controllers) are often unable to read the meters and collect revenue, as most meters \nare  installed  inside  the  house.  Controllers  can  decide  to  either  disconnect  the  customers \nimmediately for past unpaid consumption or overlook the excess consumption and enter into the \nsystem a reading lower than the actual one. \n \n8. \nAEM,  or  \u201csmart  metering\u201d  with  digital  meters,  allows  two-way  communication  between \nthe  utility  and  consumers.  AEM  enables  the  utility  to  remotely  monitor  and  disconnect  supply \nwithout  sending  reading  personnel  to  the  site.  It  provides  consumers  with  power  usage \ninformation  more  frequently.  AEM  can  help  identify  losses,  reduce  commercial  losses,  and \nimprove  tariff  collection.  The  AEM  system  will  accommodate  both  pre-  and  post-payment. \nUzbekenergo  expects  to  use  AEM  technology  to  increase  energy  efficiency  through  loss \nreduction and, potentially, demand-side management.5\n \n \n9. \nWith  an  internal  budget  of  $32  million,  Uzbekenergo  is  installing  bulk  revenue  meters \ncapable  of  accurately  measuring  and  reporting  interval  demand  for  large,  high-  and  medium-\nvoltage industrial customers and transmission\u2013distribution interfaces. This is to be completed by \nthe  end  of  2014.  The  installation  of  an  AEM  system  that  encompasses  low-voltage  residential \nand small commercial customers is a step toward ensuring the accurate measurement of losses \nin  various  system  components,  allowing  loss  reduction  efforts  to  focus  on  feeders  with  the \nhighest losses. \n \n10. \nUzbekenergo  has  undertaken  several  pilot  automated  and  advanced  metering  projects \nin  Tashkent,  covering  53,000  consumers.  The  pilot  schemes  have  generally  reduced \ncommercial  and  collection \ntwo-way \ncommunication  feature  allowed  remote  connection  and  disconnection  and  prevents  theft  and \nbypassing  the  meter.  However,  integration  was  difficult  because  of  the  differing  and \nincompatible  technologies  used.  Building  on  the  experience  of  the  pilot  projects  in  Tashkent, \nUzbekenergo  and  the  government  plan  to  integrate  the  AEM  system  and  expand  it  to  all  4.5 \nmillion  customers  in  phases.  After  covering  the  first  1  million  customers  with  ADB  assistance, \nthe same system will be replicated in other regions.7\n \n \n11. \nefficiency and reliable power supply.8\nsector. \n \n\nThe  project  follows  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  which  includes  a  focus  on  energy \n It will be ADB's second intervention in Uzbekistan's power \n\nincreasing  revenue. 6  AEM\u2019s \n\nlosses,  substantially \n\n                                                \n5  AEM  technology  enables  the  utility  to  manage  load  with  tariffs  differentiated  by  time  of  day.  The  power  usage \ninformation that consumers will have access to, and the utility\u2019s ability to remotely control the power supply, can be \nused to encourage consumers to conserve energy and pay on time. \n\n6  The revenue increase attributable to the pilot projects was 80% of the base revenue in 2005 (World Bank.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n12. \nThe impact of the project will be a power sector that is more financially viable. AEM will \nhelp improve energy efficiency and ensure that the energy used is properly accounted for and \nbilled. The project outcome will be substantially reduced commercial and tariff collection losses \nfor residential and small business entity customers. The project will target distribution systems in \nBukhara, Jizzakh and Samarkand. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe  project  will  install  advanced  electricity  meters  in  1  million  residences  and \ncommercial  entities.  It  will  enable  Uzbekenergo  to  monitor  the  energy  balance.  The  billing \nsystem will be automated to improve accuracy and efficiency. The project will improve metering \naccuracy, anti-tampering and fault-detection capability, billing efficiency, and the tariff collection \nrate. \n \nThe  project  will  improve  the  quality  of  customer  service.  With  better  access  to \n14. \ninformation on their power usage and energy efficiency, customers will be able to make better \ndecisions on electricity use. In households, women are the main users of electricity but do not \nnecessarily  make  spending  decisions.  The  project  will  give  them  more  household  decision-\nmaking power, as well as train them for jobs at regional data-management centers and district \nservice centers. \n \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Outputs \n\n15. \nAdvanced  electricity  metering  system  development.  The  system  requires  (i)  the \ninstallation of 1 million meters and an associated data communication system, including single-\nphase  retail  AEM  meters  for  residential  and  small  commercial  customers,  16,000  data \nconcentrators  for  retail  meters  and  bulk  three-phase  meters  to  obtain  balance  (one  per \ntransformer),  and  cable  products  and  (ii)  the  programming  and  installation  of  meter  data-\nmanagement  (MDM)  and  billing  systems,  including  computers,  printers,  servers,  and  software \nfor three regional data-management centers and 45 district service centers. \n \n\n2. \n\nNonphysical Outputs \n\n16. \nTraining Uzbekenergo personnel. Skills training will be given to (i) staff that will install \nmeters  and  create  the  customer  database,  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  personnel  and \nmanagement  at  regional  data-management  and  district  service  centers,  and  (iii)  meter \ncontrollers  who  will  be  transferred  to  other  sections.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  women \nemployees.  Contractors  and  a  supervision  and  project  management  consultant  will  train  staff \nand transfer knowledge. \n \n17. \nPublic  information  program.  The  program  will  disseminate  information  on  electricity \nservices,  payment,  and  energy  conservation  through  media  and  other  means,  with  special \nattention paid to household gender roles. The program will also improve the complaint-redress \nmechanism and emergency hotline. \n \nD. \n \n18. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $200 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n  \n\nAmount \n\nInstallation works and services \n\n \nBase Cost a \n1.

The  PMU,  funded  by \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  internal  sources,  will  administer  all  consulting  and  procurement  contracts  on \nbehalf of Uzbekenergo. It will be responsible for preparing project plans, bid evaluation reports, \nprogress reports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and any other reports required by ADB. \n \n23. \nUzbekenergo will employ a single contractor to (i) procure the MDM and billing systems \nfor the regional offices and district service centers and (ii) the advanced electricity meters and \nassociated  communication  system  using  ADB's  single-stage,  two-envelope  bidding  procedure. \nThe contractor will provide related services  to Uzbekenergo such as training, trouble-shooting, \nand the customization and installation of the MDM and billing systems. \n \n24. \nfocusing on gender impacts.10\n\nADB  will  rigorously  assess  the  project\u2019s  social  and  economic  impacts  on  households, \n\n Uzbekenergo will facilitate the impact evaluation study. \n\n                                                \n9  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n25. \nADB  conducted  technical  due  diligence  on  the  proposed  investments  and  is  satisfied \nwith the rationale, technical specifications, quantities, and cost estimates. The AEM system will \nmake billing transparent, improve operational efficiency, and build the strategic infrastructure for \nfuture load management in the three project regions. \n \n26. \nThe  project  will  consist  of  two  components  to  allow  full  AEM  system  functionality:  (i) \nmeters  and  an  associated  communication  system  and  (ii)  the  MDM  and  billing  systems.  The \nproject  will  replace  over  1  million  conventional  electromechanical  electricity  meters  with \nadvanced,  highly  accurate  solid-state  electricity  meters.  Manipulation  will  be  minimized  by \ninstalling all meters outside of customer premises, in publicly accessible and visible areas, and \nin weather-proof and tamper-proof cabinets. A three-phase bulk meter will be installed at each \ntransformer  to  allow  electricity  balancing.  The  meter  data  will  be  transmitted  to  the  MDM  and \nbilling  systems,  eliminating  the  commercial  losses  caused  by  frequent  human  errors  and \ninaccurate  measurements.  Secure  two-way  communication  links  will  be  installed  between  all \nmeters, regional centers, and district service centers through existing power line carriers and/or \ncommunication  infrastructure,  to  enable  frequent  monitoring  of  meter  reading  and  better \nmanagement control. \n \n27. \nRegional  offices  will  be  equipped  with  separate  MDM  and  billing  systems  and  provide \nsystem  operation  and  management  oversight.  The  MDM  system  will  be  customized  to \noperational needs and improve the efficiency of management and operational processes. Each \nregional office will be able to perform MDM functions, including regional load balancing, financial \naudit and planning, service quality monitoring, and asset management, as well as adopt a real-\ntime tariff structure. The system will be able to integrate large-scale customers connected with 6 \nkilovolts (kV), 10 kV, and 35 kV supply lines into the system. \n \n28. \nForty-five  existing  district  service  centers  in  Bukhara,  Jizzakh  and  Samarkand  will  be \nprovided with billing hardware and software and linked to the regional MDM centers through a \ncommunication  system.  The  service  centers  will  extract  information  from  the  regional  MDM \nsystem. The AEM system will enable service centers to (i) improve operation efficiency in their \ntraditional functions such as billing and customer management and relations, (ii) balance load at \nthe  district  or  transformer  level  to  reduce  commercial  losses,  (iii)  improve  system  stability  by \nlimiting  the  load  that  can  be  drawn  during  supply  shortages  or  other  emergencies,  and  (iv) \nremotely connect and disconnect customers. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nThe  project\u2019s  economic  viability  is  assessed  based  on  streams  of  benefits  and  costs \nresulting from installation and operation over the project\u2019s life. By eliminating distribution losses \ncaused, for example, by bypassing meters, the project may reduce consumption by those who \nare  not  paying  properly.  But  the  benefits  of  additional  consumption  resulting  from  reduced \noutages  and  efficient  electricity  distribution  will  be  significant.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n10 This impact evaluation study is expected to be financed through separate technical assistance to be processed and \n\nimplemented beginning in early 2012. \n\n\freturn  is  18.0%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  12.0%  opportunity  cost  of  capital  and \njustifies investment in the project. \n \n30. \nThe project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is 8.0%, which compares favorably with the \nestimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  1.8%,  indicating  that  the  project  is  financially \nviable. Financial viability was gauged by comparing the revenue and cost streams of scenarios \nwith and without the project. The revenue stream from residential and commercial customers is \nexpected to increase by 70%. \n \n31. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  financial  performance  has  been  strong  since  2006.  The  company  has \nbecome highly profitable, with a low debt\u2013equity ratio, helped by the accelerated depreciation of \nfixed  assets.  Most  of  the  fixed  assets  are  inherited  as  equity,  not  as  debt,  and  their  residual \nvalue appears to have already depreciated. \n \nThe  projected  financial  sustainability  for  2011\u20132015  incorporates  Uzbekenergo's \n32. \ninvestment  plan  to  expand  its  power  facilities.  The  total  investment,  including  this  project,  will \nrequire funding of over $3 billion. The financial plan, with a good mix of debt and Uzbekenergo's \ninternal  sources,  can  be  implemented  without  putting  undue  stress  on  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  future \nfinances  and  creditworthiness.  But  the  tariff  should  be  adjusted  to  reflect  the  cost  of  services \nand inflation. \n \n33. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  challenge  is  how  to  manage  the  cost  of  new  finance  required  to  replace \naging  power  infrastructure,  most  of  which  continues  in  use  beyond  its  economic  life.  The \ngovernment is committed to maintaining the cost of service tariffs for electricity. Since 2004, the \nnominal tariff for electricity has increased by 18%\u201320% per year. As a result, the retail tariff per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh)  has since  2004  more than quadrupled, from  SUM20/kWh  to  SUM84/kWh. \nContinued  tariff  increases  above  the  10%  rate  of  inflation  has  allowed  the  power  utility  to \nachieve a sustainable financial performance without direct subsidy. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\ntax \n\nfinancial  management  and \n\n34. \nThe  government  has  undertaken  a  series  of  measures  to  strengthen  its  national \ngovernance, including (i) legal reforms to improve the judiciary and courts; (ii) reforms to public \nsector  management,  especially  public \n(iii)  demonopolization  measures  to  make  the  private  sector  more  competitive;  and  (iv)  more \ntransparent procurement procedures. Progress has been made in public financial management, \nincluding the adoption of the Budget System Law and Treasury Law approved in 2007 and the \npublic  expenditure  reform  process  covering  2007\u20132018.  Uzbekistan  acceded  to  the  United \nNations Convention against Corruption in July 2008. A comprehensive governance assessment \nis being conducted as part of ADB's new country partnership strategy now under preparation. \n \n35. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  Uzbekenergo  found  that  it  has  a  basic \nfinancial and accounting policy that adopts accrual accounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and \nother  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and  conventions  in  compliance  with  national \nstandards.  Capacity  development  under  the  ongoing  Talimarjan  Power  Project  will  strengthen \nUzbekenergo's financial management capacity and accounting and auditing practices.11\n \n \n\n                                                \n11 ADB.  2010.

It  has  limited \n36. \nexperience working with ADB.12 Smooth project implementation requires (i) that the PMU have \ndirect access to Uzbekenergo management for efficient decision making, (ii) the staffing of PMU \nwith  competent  specialists  and  translators,  and  (iii)  an  international  consultant  to  assist  in \nprocurement  and  related  activities. 13  Procurement  will  follow  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  including  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  key  PMU  staff  members  have  participated  in  a  procurement  workshop.  An \ninternational  consultant  under  ADB  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  will  help \nUzbekenergo  prepare  bidding  documents.14\n Supervision  and  project  management  consultants \nwill assist in bid evaluation and contract negotiation, as well as provide PMU staff with on-the-\njob  training  in  procurement.  An  early  warning  system  will  be  established  to  ensure  timely \nprocurement and project implementation. \n \n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 9). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n38. \nThe project will help improve customer services by (i) increasing the staffing of existing \ndistrict  service  centers,  (ii)  introducing  a  24-hour  customer  service  hotline  with  emergency \nresponse  services  for  households,  (iii)  establishing  a  complaint-redress  mechanism,  and  (iv) \ndeveloping a participatory public information program. \n \nThe  project  will  improve  fair  billing  for  electricity.  It  will  empower  consumers  through  a \n39. \npublic  information  program,  with  women  as  agents  of  change  to  promote  energy  efficiency, \nconsumer rights, and the newly  introduced billing system. The project will also improve career \nopportunities and working conditions for women, allowing women meter readers (or controllers) \nto  be  absorbed  into  safer  job  environments  and  retrained.  The  project\u2019s  gender  action  plan \nincludes  improving  project  benefits  for  women  and,  therefore,  gender  equality  in  the  energy \nsector.15\n  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n40. \nNo  major  social  or  environmental  safeguards  issues  are  envisaged  under  the  project. \nThe  project  is  category  C  for  all  safeguards  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).  ADB  will  monitor  safeguards  issues  during  implementation.  If  any  unanticipated \nenvironmental  or  social  impacts  become  apparent  during  project  implementation,  ADB  will \nadvise  and  require  the  Uzbekenergo  to  (i)  assess  the  significance  of  such  unanticipated \nimpacts;  (ii)  evaluate  the  options  available  to  address  them;  (iii)  prepare  relevant  safeguards \ndocuments; and (iv) take necessary action(s). The project will be implemented and operated in \ncompliance  with  the  government\u2019s  rules  and regulations  governing  the  project\u2019s  environmental \nand social aspects. \n \n\n                                                \n12 Uzbekenergo has limited experience working with other multilateral and bilateral financiers; this is the second ADB \n\nproject in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector. \n\n13 These  key  success  factors  were  the  lessons  from  the  Talimarjan  Power  Project,  the  first  ADB  energy  project  in \n\nUzbekistan. \n\n14 ADB.  2010.
