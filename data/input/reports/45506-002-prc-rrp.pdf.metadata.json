I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Jiuquan Integrated Urban Environment \nImprovement Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  aims  to  promote  environmentally  sustainable  and  socioeconomically \ninclusive urban development in Jiuquan, Gansu province, by upgrading urban infrastructure and \nservices. The project will support wastewater management, urban transport and utility facilities, \nwindbreak plantation, and related services.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  since  1980,  but  such  progress  has  not  been  balanced  across  different  regions. \nLocated  in  the  country\u2019s  northwestern  region,  Gansu  has  lagged  behind  in  the  economic \ndevelopment and remains one of the poorest provinces in the PRC.3 In 2011, the poverty rates \nin Gansu province were 9.4% for urban and 20.4% for rural households, significantly higher than \nthe national averages of 3.3% and 8.1%. Development barriers facing Gansu include a harsh \nnatural  environment,  remote  inland  location,  underdeveloped  infrastructure,  and  lack  of \ninvestment. Such wide regional disparities prompted the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China to launch the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region, with the aim to \npromote balanced economic growth and to raise the living standards in the region.4 The strategy \nfocuses on developing infrastructure, protecting the environment, and strengthening economic \ncooperation and trade with neighboring provinces and countries.  \n \n4.  The project is located in Jiuquan, Gansu province, about 730 kilometers (km) northwest \nof the provincial capital of Lanzhou.5 Jiuquan\u2019s key industries are renewable energy equipment \nmanufacturing and agricultural product processing. Tourism has increasingly contributed to the \ncity\u2019s economic output based on its rich historic and cultural resources and the launching site of \nthe national space program. Historically an oasis on the ancient Silk Road along the Hexi \nCorridor, Jiuquan has the potential to serve as a vital artery for the relatively less-developed \nnorthwestern region of the PRC and play a strategic role in aiding the region's socioeconomic \ndevelopment as envisaged under the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region.  \n \n5.  Challenges. Jiuquan faces various environmental problems and urban development \nchallenges due to its harsh natural environment and inadequate urban infrastructure. Situated \nbetween  the  southern  limits  of  the  Gobi  desert  and  the  Qilian  Mountains,  Jiuquan  has  a \ncontinental desert climate with constrained water resources and high evaporation.6 Sand and \ndust transported by frequent strong winds from the desert cause atmospheric pollution, a high \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Gansu Jiuquan Urban Environment Improvement \nProject. Manila (TA 7847-PRC). \n3  In 2011, per capita gross domestic product in Gansu was CNY19,595, compared with the national average of \nCNY35,181, third lowest among provinces, major municipalities, and autonomous regions in the PRC. The average \nannual per capita disposable incomes in Gansu were CNY14,989 for urban and CNY3,909 for rural households, \nsubstantially lower than the national averages of CNY21,810 and CNY6,977. \n4  State Council of the PRC. 2000. The National Strategy for Development of the Western Region. Beijing. \n5  Jiuquan municipality comprises Suzhou district (Jiuquan city area), Dunhuang city, Yumen city, Akesei county, \nGuazhou county, Jinta county, and Subei county.  \n6  Average annual precipitation is 84 millimeters (mm) and average annual evaporation is 2,140 mm in Jiuquan. ", "2 \nincidence of respiratory illness, and productivity losses.7 The water quality in the Beida River is \nclass II for the upstream reach of Jiuquan city, class III through the city area, and class IV \ndownstream, resulting from discharges of untreated wastewater from the city.8 As a water- \nscarce city undergoing continuous growth, Jiuquan must stem the gradual contamination of its \nwater  resources,  which  endangers  public  health  and  safety  and  constrains  its  sustainable \ndevelopment. Jiuquan\u2019s increasingly congested urban roads and inadequate infrastructure also \nlimit the city\u2019s ability to promote greater links along the Hexi Corridor and enable socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the northwestern region.  \n \n6.  Wastewater. An estimated 66% of wastewater is treated in Jiuquan city at an existing \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Excessive wastewater overflows and discharges into the \nBeida River. There is an urgent need to expand the wastewater collection and treatment system \nto serve broader coverage in the existing and expanded urban areas. The project will support \nthe construction of a new WWTP and an associated wastewater collection network to expand \nthe service area, targeting an 88% treatment rate by 2019 and mitigating pollution loads into the \nBeida River. The project will also provide institutional support for wastewater reuse and sludge \ntreatment and disposal options appropriate to the local conditions.9 \n \n7.  Urban transport. According to the Jiuquan Urban Master Plan, 2011\u20132030,10 Jiuquan \ncity will expand northward and westward, ultimately integrating economically with Jiayuguan \ncity, 20 km to the northwest. The now incomplete and increasingly congested road network and \nill-managed transport system are constraints to sustainable urban development. The project will \nsupport the construction and rehabilitation of an urban transport network, thereby relieving \ncongestion  in  the  existing  road  network,  improving  access  to  a  main  employment  area, \nexpanding  farm-to-market  routes  for  neighboring  rural  areas,  and  facilitating  economic \nintegration between Jiuquan and Jiayuguan. It will improve urban service delivery by expanding \nmunicipal utility services networks along the roads. It will also help improve traffic management \nand road safety, and introduce a public transport corridor for the main road connecting the \nplanned high-speed railway station to the central urban area and to the expanded urban area to \nthe north.   \n \n8.  Forestry. Jiuquan suffers from frequent winds and sandstorms and is in a state of \nmoderate  desertification.  The  Jiuquan  municipal  government  (JMG),  recognizing  the \nconstrained physical environment and the importance of its prudent management to the city\u2019s \nsustainable  development,  has  made  increasing  investments  in  afforestation  and  resources \nreuse for ecological and environmental improvement. In support of these efforts, the project will \nestablish an ecological corridor by planting windbreak tree screens along the banks of the Beida \nRiver. This will provide natural windbreaks for the city against sandstorms, enhance public \namenities,  and  improve  the  living  environment  and  public  health  of  local  residents,  with \nadditional benefits of carbon sequestration, sand fixation, securing agricultural production, soil \nconservation, and regulation of micro-climate. \n                                                \n7  According to the Jiuquan Environmental Protection Bureau, the annual average of daily sand and dust deposits \nfrom the atmosphere is 22.9 tons per square kilometer (km2) per day. After the 5-day sandstorm in April 2011, it \nwas reported that 31.1 km2 of farmland had been affected, resulting in direct economic losses of CNY15.7 million. \n8  PRC water quality standards (GB 3838-2002) have five classes. Class I is pristine, class II is for high-value fish \nproduction areas and spawning habitats, class III is suitable for urban water supply, class IV is suitable for irrigation \nand recreation, and class V is polluted and not recommended for human consumption or agricultural use. \n9  Effluent wastewater from the project-supported WWTP will be reused for industrial purposes subject to detailed \ntechnical and economic analyses on various reuse alternatives, including landscaping and agricultural uses. This \nwill be supported by the capacity development component of the project. The project will also support sludge \ntreatment and disposal option analysis. \n10 Jiuquan municipal government. 2012.

The project will contribute to balanced regional development \nin the PRC, thereby supporting the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. By promoting \nsustainable and environment-friendly urban development, the project aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC.11 It  promotes  economic  growth  that  is  environmentally \nsustainable and inclusive, in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.12  It contributes to Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7 by improving sanitation. It conforms with ADB\u2019s urban, water, and transport \nsector  strategies,  which  encourage  green,  competitive,  and  inclusive  urban  development, \nefficient water use, expanded wastewater management, rehabilitation of degraded forestlands, \nand sustainable urban transport.13 It builds on ADB\u2019s experience and lessons gained from \nprevious  projects  in  Gansu  and  other  urban  projects  in  the  PRC,14 and  from  knowledge \ngenerated in policy-oriented studies on urban water security, sludge management, and dryland \necosystems,  including  the  (i)  need  for  well-programmed  capacity  building  to  accompany \nphysical  investments  to  enhance  sustainability;  (ii)  importance  of  continued  support  and \ncommitment to sector reforms such as cost recovery and resources conservation and reuse to \nimprove sector performance and sustainability; and (iii) need for integrated, participatory, and \nwell-coordinated management of the sensitive ecosystem in arid areas. \n \n10.  Special features. The project is designed to boost integrated environmental and social \nbenefits and involve community participation in project design and implementation. It has the \nfollowing special features:  \n(i)  To assist the government\u2019s strategy for resources reuse, it will lend institutional \nsupport to wastewater reuse and sludge utilization in a manner befitting the local \nconditions. \n(ii)  The  design  of  the  urban  transport  will  take  into  account  road  safety, \nnonmotorized transport, and integration of the public transport system with a view \nto the planned high-speed railway. Road safety campaigns with schools, bus \nstations, drivers association, and communities will be supported to step up public \nsafety awareness. To reinforce the social benefits of the road network, JMG gave \nassurances to allot adequate low-income housing in the expanded urban area. \n(iii)  Windbreak plantation will adopt a multifunctional approach to reduce air pollution \nand land degradation, improve the city\u2019s resilience to climate change impacts, \nand provide a landscaped area for public amenity. The results will be monitored \nthrough a quantitative evaluation system that the project will develop. The project \nwill also support regular water balance analyses and establish an ecological \neducation trail to inform the public on the city\u2019s exposure to desertification and \nthe benefits of afforestation.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project\u2019s impact will be environmentally sustainable and socioeconomically inclusive \nurban development in Jiuquan. The project\u2019s outcome will be improved urban infrastructure and \nservices in Jiuquan.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.

Contingencies include provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate.  \nd  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for the ADB loan has been computed at \nthe 5-year US dollar fixed swap rate plus a spread of 0.4% and maturity premium of 0.2%. Commitment charges \nfor an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. Interest during construction \nfor the domestic bank loan from the China Construction Bank is computed at 6.55% per year.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n15 Detailed cost estimates are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "5 \n14.  The government  has requested  a  loan  of  $100  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility,16 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan \nwill finance 46.2% of the project cost, including works, goods, and consulting services and \ntraining. The loan will also finance taxes and duties for eligible ADB-financed expenditures, and \ntransportation  and  insurance  costs.  JMG  will  provide  counterpart  funding  equivalent  to \n$54.23 million, which will finance 25.1% of the project cost. It has also requested a loan of about \n$62.20 million from the China Construction Bank to cover 28.7% of the project cost.

The EIRR for \neach component is computed at 12.4% for wastewater, 15.2% for urban transport, and 14.0% \nfor windbreak plantation, each exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR for wastewater is sensitive to changes in either costs \nor benefits, the EIRR for urban transport is robust to adverse changes, and the EIRR for \nwindbreak plantation is generally robust but sensitive to simultaneous increase in costs and \ndecrease  in  benefits.  However,  all  EIRRs  are  considered  underestimated,  as  all  project \ncomponents  have  significant  benefits  not  easily  quantified.17 Sustainability  of  the  project \ndepends on adequate O&M of the project facilities throughout their expected economic life. \nEconomic costs include capital costs for four components, physical contingencies, and O&M \ncosts. Economic benefits for wastewater are based on estimates of willingness to pay as \nderived from the contingent valuation survey conducted during project preparation; for urban \ntransport, they are based on (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) time savings, (iii) accident \ncost reductions, and (iv) road maintenance cost savings; and for windbreak, on (i) more income \ndue to employment generated by the component, (ii) benefits from carbon sequestration, and \n(iii) avoided damages on agricultural crops and properties due to occurrence of sandstorms. \n \n20.  Financial. The analysis of the financial viability of the revenue-generating component\u2014\nwastewater\u2014finds a financial internal rate of return at 2.3%, which compares favorably with the \n1.4% weighted average cost of capital. Wastewater tariff increases are proposed to achieve full \ncost recovery by 2027, as assured by JMG. The analysis of existing tariffs and cost-recovery \narrangements shows full cost recovery to be unrealistic in the short term without government \nsubsidy. However, the project will promote progressive tariff increases through the capacity \ndevelopment  component,  following  the  PRC  process  for  public  participation  in  water  tariff \nreform.18 The wastewater tariff will equal 0.4% of an average household\u2019s income and 0.7% of a \npoor household\u2019s income, considered affordable. The proposed tariff increase is within the \namount that beneficiaries are willing to pay. The tariff subsidy to the poor will be maintained.19 \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is sensitive to a revenue \ndecrease and O&M cost increase. Hence, realizing a tariff increase and controlling costs will be \ncrucial in ensuring the financial viability of the wastewater component. Financial sustainability \nanalysis indicates that JMG presents acceptable fiscal risk in its ability to provide counterpart \nfunds for capital investment, finance O&M costs, and service project debts. Its contributions to \nthe project will be less than 0.5% of its fiscal revenue over the project implementation period, \nand debt service and O&M costs will not exceed 0.7% of fiscal revenue during the operation \nperiod.  The  nonrevenue-generating  components\u2014urban  transport  and  utility  facilities  and \nwindbreak plantation\u2014are therefore considered both financially sustainable and affordable. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Gansu provincial government, JMG, and JEDIC. Specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM, e.g., providing support and training on ADB \npolicies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent and project implementation consultants to \n                                                \n17 Not readily quantifiable benefits such as health benefits were not included in the economic analysis. Better water \nquality and urban environment are probably not fully reflected in the willingness-to-pay survey because of their \nintangibility.  \n18  Tariff analysis is described in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), \nand tariff increases and associated capacity development support are assured in the draft Project Agreement and \nPAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n19  Poor households receiving minimum living standard security are eligible for a 50% discount in wastewater tariff up \nto 6 m3 per month.  \n ", "8 \nstrengthen  procurement,  and  involving  the  Jiuquan  Discipline  Investigation  Bureau  in \nprocurement.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that,  although  the  project \nmanagement  office  and  JEDIC  have  general  financial  management  capacity  and  project \nmanagement experience, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and require \na component that builds their capacity to implement the project in line with ADB policies and \nprocedures. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Poverty and social. Poverty and social analysis was undertaken through a household \nsurvey, community and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The project will \ndirectly benefit over 450,000 urban residents, of whom about 8.6% are poor, by improving living \nconditions, urban services, public health, urban environment, and ecology. The project will \ncreate about 8,000 jobs during construction of the wastewater and urban transport components, \nand about 145 jobs during operation. It is also estimated that about 3,000 person-days of labor \nwill  be  generated for  windbreak  plantation.  Employment  targets for  vulnerable  groups  and \nwomen are included in the design and monitoring framework and loan assurances. Better urban \nenvironment and transport services through expanded wastewater management, windbreak \nprotection, and a road network with stronger public and nonmotorized transport and road safety \nwill improve public health and safety. A social development action plan has been prepared and \nwill be implemented by the project management office in collaboration with other stakeholders \nduring project implementation. The project will not only improve the urban environment but also \nraise  public  awareness  on  water  conservation,  wastewater  tariffs,  road  safety,  and  anti-\ndesertification and thereby help sustain socioeconomic development in Jiuquan. \n \n23.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action \nplan has been prepared with agreed activities and indicators. The analysis of the survey and \nfocus group discussion data reveals that women are affected by poor mobility and access, \ngenerally burdened with family and household responsibilities, and employed in low-paying jobs. \nImproving sanitary conditions through expanded wastewater services will benefit women by \nreducing illness and associated time and cost burdens. Improvements to urban transport and \nattention to the needs of women in the planning of public transport, pedestrian, nonmotorized \ntransport access, and road safety programs will benefit women by increasing access, mobility, \nand safety, reducing time and cost burdens, and improving productivity. The healthier ecological \nenvironment and green space will provide recreational areas for women and children. Women\u2019s \nparticipation in windbreak plantation, education trail design, various public awareness activities, \nand public hearings on the wastewater tariff will strengthen the effectiveness of project activities \nand bolster project sustainability. The gender action plan includes specific targets for women in \nemployment,  participation,  and  capacity-building  opportunities,  and  is  supported  by  a  loan \nassurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  Environment.  The  project  is  environment  category  B.  An  initial  environment \nexamination\u2014prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nposted on the ADB website\u2014concludes that the project will have substantial environmental \nbenefits and that its potential adverse environmental impacts can be mitigated through the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). Construction and operation of the project components \nhave potential impacts on the environment, but these are site-specific, reversible, and not \nunprecedented. Dust and noise generated by construction activities could be a nuisance to \nnearby  residents  unless  mitigated.  Discharge  of  wastewater  from  construction  sites  could \n ", "9 \npotentially pollute nearby water bodies. Traffic on the project roads could generate air and noise \npollution that may affect nearby sensitive receptors. Operation of the WWTP could generate \nodor and noise impacts. Environmental management measures defined in the EMP, such as \nsound construction site management and regular monitoring of the  project\u2019s environmental \nperformance during construction and operation, will reduce these impacts to acceptable levels. \nJMG will be responsible for the overall implementation and compliance with the EMP, including \ninspection, monitoring, reporting, and corrective actions or measures. Contractors as well as \nJEDIC during construction, and facility operators during operation, will implement the EMP \nmeasures. Environmental management is supported by capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project  and  loan  covenants.  JMG  disclosed  relevant \nenvironment  information  to  potentially  affected people,  and  the results  and findings  of the \nconsultation process were used to modify the initial environmental examination and finalize the \nproject  design.  Consultations  and  public  participation  will  continue  throughout  project \nimplementation. Environmental complaints will be handled in accordance with the environment \ngrievance redress mechanism developed for the project. The EMP is in Annex 1 of the PAM. \n \n25.  Resettlement. The project is resettlement category A. A total of 897 mu of land will be \npermanently acquired, including 609 mu of collective land and 288 mu of state-owned land.20 A \nfurther 351 mu of state-owned land will be temporarily occupied during project implementation. \nLand acquisition will affect 138 households with 547 persons.21 A total of 5,624 square meters \n(m2) of rural residences and 21,580 m2 of nonresidential structures will be demolished, affecting \n22 households with 88 persons, and 21 enterprises with 162 employees. A resettlement plan \nwas  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  endorsed  by  JMG, \ndisclosed  to  affected  people  in  the  local  language,  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  The \nresettlement plan will be finalized in line with the detailed engineering design and detailed \nmeasurement survey, disclosed to affected people in the local language, and submitted to ADB \nfor  approval  before  awarding  civil  works  contracts.  Compensation  for  lost  assets  and \nresettlement allowances will be paid to affected people, and livelihood rehabilitation will be \narranged in accordance with the resettlement plan before starting the related civil works. The \nproject management office and JEDIC will assume responsibility for planning, implementing, \nfinancing, and reporting on land acquisition and resettlement. A grievance redress mechanism \nwas established. \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples. The project is indigenous peoples category C. In Jiuquan city, \nethnic minorities make up about 1.6% of the population. They are socially and economically well \nintegrated and will benefit from the project activities as much as the mainstream population. The \nproject will not have any impact on the dignity, human rights, traditional lands, or culture of \nethnic minorities. No buildings with cultural or religious significance to ethnic minorities are in \nthe project area. The project will not have any direct impact on their livelihoods. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \n \n                                                \n20 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n21  Of these, 78 households with 297 persons will be seriously affected, losing more than 10% of their productive land.  \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays due  JMG has hired a qualified tendering agent with ADB procurement experience.    \nto the limited experience of  The project will provide consulting services for technical support and on-the-\nthe PMO and JEDIC in  job trainings in procurement, disbursement, and financial management. \nprojects financed by  JMG has established rapport with the implementing agencies of previous ADB \nmultilateral agencies  urban sector projects in Gansu to learn about ADB guidelines and \nprocedures.  \nDelay in land acquisition  JMG will make available for and timely release of funds for compensation \nand resettlement   under its fiscal budget as per loan covenant.  \nThe project will support (i) initial project implementation by engaging a \nresettlement expert to assist in detailed measurement surveys and \nresettlement plan finalization, and (ii) independent resettlement monitoring \nto ensure compliance. \nUnsustainable operation  JMG will ensure adequate staff resources and annual operation and \nand maintenance of  maintenance budget as per loan covenants. \ninfrastructure components  The project will provide (i) infrastructural support for management \ndue to lack of capacity or  improvement such as wastewater system monitoring, road maintenance, \nbudget  and traffic management; and (ii) institutional support for prudent \noperational practices and trainings. \nDelay in tariff increase  JMG will implement a phased tariff increase to achieve full cost recovery by \n2027 as per loan covenant.  \nThe project will provide institutional support for annual tariff reviews and \npublic awareness program. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JEDIC = Jiuquan Economic Development and Investment Company, JMG = \nJiuquan municipal government, PMO = project management office.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n28.  The  government,  Gansu  provincial  government,  and  JMG  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, Gansu \nprovincial government, and JMG have also agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n29.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Jiuquan \nIntegrated Urban Environment Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \nBindu N.
