The project will support wastewater management, urban transport and utility facilities, \nwindbreak plantation, and related services.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction  since  1980,  but  such  progress  has  not  been  balanced  across  different  regions. \nLocated  in  the  country\u2019s  northwestern  region,  Gansu  has  lagged  behind  in  the  economic \ndevelopment and remains one of the poorest provinces in the PRC.3 In 2011, the poverty rates \nin Gansu province were 9.4% for urban and 20.4% for rural households, significantly higher than \nthe  national  averages  of  3.3%  and  8.1%.  Development  barriers  facing  Gansu  include  a  harsh \nnatural  environment,  remote  inland  location,  underdeveloped  infrastructure,  and  lack  of \ninvestment. Such wide regional disparities prompted the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China to launch the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region, with the aim to \npromote balanced economic growth and to raise the living standards in the region.4 The strategy \nfocuses  on  developing  infrastructure,  protecting  the  environment,  and  strengthening  economic \ncooperation and trade with neighboring provinces and countries.  \n \n4. \nThe project is located in Jiuquan, Gansu province, about 730 kilometers (km) northwest \nof the provincial capital of Lanzhou.5 Jiuquan\u2019s key industries are renewable energy equipment \nmanufacturing and agricultural product processing. Tourism has increasingly contributed to the \ncity\u2019s economic output based on its rich historic and cultural resources and the launching site of \nthe  national  space  program.  Historically  an  oasis  on  the  ancient  Silk  Road  along  the  Hexi \nCorridor,  Jiuquan  has  the  potential  to  serve  as  a  vital  artery  for  the  relatively  less-developed \nnorthwestern  region  of the  PRC  and  play  a strategic  role  in  aiding the  region's  socioeconomic \ndevelopment as envisaged under the National Strategy for Development of the Western Region.  \n \n5. \nChallenges.  Jiuquan  faces  various  environmental  problems  and  urban  development \nchallenges  due  to  its  harsh  natural  environment  and  inadequate  urban  infrastructure.  Situated \nbetween  the  southern  limits  of  the  Gobi  desert  and  the  Qilian  Mountains,  Jiuquan  has  a \ncontinental  desert  climate  with  constrained  water  resources  and  high  evaporation.6 Sand  and \ndust transported by frequent strong winds from the desert cause atmospheric pollution,  a high \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2011.  Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the  Gansu Jiuquan Urban Environment Improvement \nProject. Manila (TA 7847-PRC). \n\n3   In  2011,  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  in  Gansu  was  CNY19,595,  compared  with  the  national  average  of \nCNY35,181, third lowest among provinces, major municipalities, and autonomous regions in the PRC. The average \nannual  per capita  disposable incomes  in  Gansu  were  CNY14,989  for  urban and  CNY3,909  for  rural  households, \nsubstantially lower than the national averages of CNY21,810 and CNY6,977. \n\n4   State Council of the PRC. 2000. The National Strategy for Development of the Western Region. Beijing. \n5   Jiuquan  municipality  comprises  Suzhou  district  (Jiuquan  city  area),  Dunhuang  city,  Yumen  city,  Akesei  county, \n\nGuazhou county, Jinta county, and Subei county.  \n\n6   Average annual precipitation is 84 millimeters (mm) and average annual evaporation is 2,140 mm in Jiuquan. \n\n\fincidence of respiratory illness, and productivity losses.7 The water quality in the Beida River is \nclass  II  for  the  upstream  reach  of  Jiuquan  city,  class  III  through  the  city  area,  and  class  IV \ndownstream,  resulting  from  discharges  of  untreated  wastewater  from  the  city. 8 As  a  water- \nscarce city undergoing continuous growth, Jiuquan must  stem the gradual contamination of its \nwater  resources,  which  endangers  public  health  and  safety  and  constrains  its  sustainable \ndevelopment. Jiuquan\u2019s increasingly congested urban roads and inadequate infrastructure also \nlimit the city\u2019s ability to promote greater links along the Hexi Corridor and enable socioeconomic \ndevelopment in the northwestern region.  \n \n6. \nWastewater.  An  estimated  66%  of  wastewater  is  treated  in  Jiuquan  city  at  an  existing \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Excessive wastewater overflows and discharges into the \nBeida River. There is an urgent need to expand the wastewater collection and treatment system \nto serve broader  coverage  in the  existing  and  expanded  urban areas. The  project  will  support \nthe  construction  of  a  new WWTP  and  an  associated  wastewater  collection  network  to  expand \nthe service area, targeting an 88% treatment rate by 2019 and mitigating pollution loads into the \nBeida River. The project will also provide institutional support for wastewater reuse and sludge \ntreatment and disposal options appropriate to the local conditions.9 \n \nUrban  transport.  According  to  the  Jiuquan  Urban  Master  Plan,  2011\u20132030,10 Jiuquan \n7. \ncity  will  expand  northward  and  westward,  ultimately  integrating  economically  with  Jiayuguan \ncity, 20 km to the northwest. The now incomplete and increasingly congested road network and \nill-managed transport system are constraints to sustainable urban development. The project will \nsupport  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  an  urban  transport  network,  thereby  relieving \ncongestion  in  the  existing  road  network,  improving  access  to  a  main  employment  area, \nexpanding  farm-to-market  routes  for  neighboring  rural  areas,  and  facilitating  economic \nintegration between Jiuquan and Jiayuguan. It will improve urban service delivery by expanding \nmunicipal utility services networks along the roads. It will also help improve traffic management \nand  road  safety,  and  introduce  a  public  transport  corridor  for  the  main  road  connecting  the \nplanned high-speed railway station to the central urban area and to the expanded urban area to \nthe north.   \n \nForestry.  Jiuquan  suffers  from  frequent  winds  and  sandstorms  and  is  in  a  state  of \n8. \nmoderate  desertification.  The  Jiuquan  municipal  government \nthe \nconstrained  physical  environment  and  the  importance  of  its  prudent  management  to  the  city\u2019s \nsustainable  development,  has  made  increasing  investments  in  afforestation  and  resources \nreuse for ecological and environmental improvement. In support of these efforts, the project will \nestablish an ecological corridor by planting windbreak tree screens along the banks of the Beida \nRiver.  This  will  provide  natural  windbreaks  for  the  city  against  sandstorms,  enhance  public \namenities,  and  improve  the  living  environment  and  public  health  of  local  residents,  with \nadditional  benefits  of  carbon  sequestration,  sand  fixation,  securing  agricultural  production,  soil \nconservation, and regulation of micro-climate. \n\nrecognizing \n\n(JMG), \n\n                                                \n7  According  to  the  Jiuquan  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  the  annual  average  of  daily  sand  and  dust  deposits \nfrom the atmosphere is 22.9 tons per square kilometer (km2) per day. After the 5-day sandstorm in April 2011,  it \nwas reported that 31.1 km2 of farmland had been affected, resulting in direct economic losses of CNY15.7 million. \n8   PRC  water  quality  standards  (GB  3838-2002)  have  five  classes.  Class  I  is  pristine,  class  II  is  for  high-value  fish \nproduction areas and spawning habitats, class III is suitable for urban water supply, class IV is suitable for irrigation \nand recreation, and class V is polluted and not recommended for human consumption or agricultural use. \n\n9   Effluent  wastewater  from  the  project-supported  WWTP  will  be  reused  for  industrial  purposes  subject  to  detailed \ntechnical and economic analyses on various reuse alternatives, including landscaping and agricultural uses. This \nwill  be  supported  by  the  capacity  development  component  of  the  project.  The  project  will  also  support  sludge \ntreatment and disposal option analysis. \n\n10 Jiuquan municipal government. 2012. Jiuquan Urban Master Plan, 2011\u20132030.

The project will contribute to balanced regional development \n9. \nin  the  PRC,  thereby  supporting  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015.  By  promoting \nsustainable and environment-friendly urban development, the project aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC. 11  It  promotes  economic  growth  that  is  environmentally \nsustainable  and  inclusive,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020. 12   It  contributes  to  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 7 by improving sanitation. It conforms with ADB\u2019s urban, water, and transport \nsector  strategies,  which  encourage  green,  competitive,  and  inclusive  urban  development, \nefficient water use, expanded wastewater management, rehabilitation of degraded forestlands, \nand  sustainable  urban  transport. 13 It  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  lessons  gained  from \nprevious  projects  in  Gansu  and  other  urban  projects  in  the  PRC, 14  and  from  knowledge \ngenerated in policy-oriented studies on urban water security, sludge management, and dryland \necosystems,  including  the  (i)  need  for  well-programmed  capacity  building  to  accompany \nphysical  investments  to  enhance  sustainability;  (ii)  importance  of  continued  support  and \ncommitment to sector reforms such as cost recovery and resources conservation and reuse to \nimprove  sector  performance  and  sustainability;  and  (iii)  need  for  integrated,  participatory,  and \nwell-coordinated management of the sensitive ecosystem in arid areas. \n \n10. \nSpecial  features. The project is designed to boost integrated environmental and social \nbenefits  and  involve  community  participation  in  project  design  and  implementation.  It  has  the \nfollowing special features:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nTo  assist  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  resources  reuse,  it  will  lend  institutional \nsupport to wastewater reuse and sludge utilization in a manner befitting the local \nconditions. \nThe  design  of \ninto  account  road  safety, \nnonmotorized transport, and integration of the public transport system with a view \nto  the  planned  high-speed  railway.  Road  safety  campaigns  with  schools,  bus \nstations, drivers association, and communities will be supported to step up public \nsafety awareness. To reinforce the social benefits of the road network, JMG gave \nassurances to allot adequate low-income housing in the expanded urban area. \n\ntransport  will \n\nthe  urban \n\ntake \n\n(iii)  Windbreak plantation will adopt a multifunctional approach to reduce air pollution \nand  land  degradation,  improve  the  city\u2019s  resilience  to  climate  change  impacts, \nand provide a landscaped area for public amenity. The results will be monitored \nthrough a quantitative evaluation system that the project will develop. The project \nwill  also  support  regular  water  balance  analyses  and  establish  an  ecological \neducation  trail  to  inform  the  public  on  the  city\u2019s  exposure  to  desertification  and \nthe benefits of afforestation.  \n\n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe project\u2019s impact will be environmentally sustainable and socioeconomically inclusive \nurban development in Jiuquan.

The  design  for  wastewater  treatment  adopts  a  proven \ntechnology  in  the  PRC,  suits  the  natural  environment,  and  is  adequate  to  attract  market \ncompetition.  Holistic  road  design  considerations  have  been  incorporated  into  the  transport \ncomponent, including junction design, nonmotorized and pedestrian lanes, stronger traffic safety \nmanagement, and a cross-section design amenable to the public transport system. Windbreak \nplantation  is  well  integrated  and  sequenced  with  other  project  components.  A  detailed \nengineering  design  will  comply  with  latest  urban  design  standards  and  specifications.  A \ncapacity-building program for related urban services is included to ensure sustainable operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of project facilities. A detailed description of components is in the PAM. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  the \n19. \nproject  components  use  least-cost  options  to  support  Jiuquan\u2019s  long-term  urban  development \nplans.  The  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  reveals  the  project\u2019s  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return \n\n \n\n\f(EIRR) at 14.5% and the overall economic net present value at CNY108.5 million. The EIRR for \neach component  is  computed  at  12.4% for  wastewater,  15.2% for  urban  transport,  and  14.0% \nfor  windbreak  plantation,  each  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12.0%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR for wastewater is sensitive to changes in either costs \nor  benefits,  the  EIRR  for  urban  transport  is  robust  to  adverse  changes,  and  the  EIRR  for \nwindbreak  plantation  is  generally  robust  but  sensitive  to  simultaneous  increase  in  costs  and \ndecrease  in  benefits.  However,  all  EIRRs  are  considered  underestimated,  as  all  project \ncomponents  have  significant  benefits  not  easily  quantified. 17  Sustainability  of  the  project \ndepends  on  adequate  O&M  of  the  project  facilities  throughout  their  expected  economic  life. \nEconomic  costs  include  capital  costs  for  four  components,  physical  contingencies,  and  O&M \ncosts.  Economic  benefits  for  wastewater  are  based  on  estimates  of  willingness  to  pay  as \nderived  from  the  contingent  valuation  survey  conducted  during  project  preparation;  for  urban \ntransport, they are based on (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) time savings, (iii) accident \ncost reductions, and (iv) road maintenance cost savings; and for windbreak, on (i) more income \ndue  to  employment  generated  by  the  component,  (ii)  benefits  from  carbon  sequestration,  and \n(iii) avoided damages on agricultural crops and properties due to occurrence of sandstorms. \n \n20. \nFinancial. The analysis of the financial viability of the revenue-generating component\u2014\nwastewater\u2014finds a financial internal rate of return at 2.3%, which compares favorably with the \n1.4% weighted average cost of capital. Wastewater tariff increases are proposed to achieve full \ncost  recovery  by  2027,  as  assured  by  JMG.  The  analysis  of  existing  tariffs  and  cost-recovery \narrangements  shows  full  cost  recovery  to  be  unrealistic  in  the  short  term  without  government \nsubsidy.  However,  the  project  will  promote  progressive  tariff  increases  through  the  capacity \ndevelopment  component,  following  the  PRC  process  for  public  participation  in  water  tariff \nreform.18 The wastewater tariff will equal 0.4% of an average household\u2019s income and 0.7% of a \npoor  household\u2019s  income,  considered  affordable.  The  proposed  tariff  increase  is  within  the \namount that beneficiaries are willing to pay. The tariff subsidy to the poor will be maintained.19 \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  sensitive  to  a  revenue \ndecrease and O&M cost increase. Hence, realizing a tariff increase and controlling costs will be \ncrucial  in  ensuring  the  financial  viability  of  the  wastewater  component.  Financial  sustainability \nanalysis  indicates  that  JMG  presents  acceptable  fiscal  risk  in  its  ability  to  provide  counterpart \nfunds for capital investment, finance O&M costs, and service project debts. Its  contributions to \nthe  project  will  be  less  than  0.5%  of  its  fiscal  revenue  over  the  project  implementation  period, \nand  debt  service  and  O&M  costs  will  not  exceed  0.7%  of  fiscal  revenue  during  the  operation \nperiod.  The  nonrevenue-generating  components\u2014urban  transport  and  utility  facilities  and \nwindbreak plantation\u2014are therefore considered both financially sustainable and affordable. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Gansu  provincial  government,  JMG,  and  JEDIC.  Specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM, e.g., providing support and training on ADB \npolicies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent and project implementation consultants to \n\n                                                \n17 Not readily quantifiable benefits such as health benefits were not included  in the economic analysis. Better water \nquality  and  urban  environment  are  probably  not  fully  reflected  in  the  willingness-to-pay  survey  because  of  their \nintangibility.  \n\n18  Tariff analysis is described in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2), \nand tariff increases and associated capacity development support are assured in the draft Project Agreement and \nPAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n\n19  Poor households receiving minimum living standard security are eligible for a 50% discount in wastewater tariff up \n\nto 6 m3 per month.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finvolving \n\nin \nstrengthen  procurement,  and \nprocurement.  The  financial  management  assessment  concludes  that,  although  the  project \nmanagement  office  and  JEDIC  have  general  financial  management  capacity  and  project \nmanagement experience, they lack sufficient experience in managing ADB projects and require \na  component  that  builds  their  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  line  with  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures. \n\nthe  Jiuquan  Discipline \n\nInvestigation  Bureau \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n22. \nPoverty  and  social. Poverty and social analysis was undertaken through a household \nsurvey, community and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The project will \ndirectly benefit over 450,000 urban residents, of whom about 8.6% are poor, by improving living \nconditions,  urban  services,  public  health,  urban  environment,  and  ecology.  The  project  will \ncreate about 8,000 jobs during construction of the wastewater and urban transport components, \nand about 145 jobs during operation. It is also estimated that about 3,000 person-days of labor \nwill  be  generated  for  windbreak  plantation.  Employment  targets  for  vulnerable  groups  and \nwomen are included in the design and monitoring framework and loan assurances. Better urban \nenvironment  and  transport  services  through  expanded  wastewater  management,  windbreak \nprotection, and a road network with stronger public and nonmotorized transport and road safety \nwill improve public health and safety. A social development action plan has been prepared and \nwill  be  implemented  by  the  project  management office  in collaboration  with  other  stakeholders \nduring project implementation. The project will not only improve the urban environment but also \nraise  public  awareness  on  water  conservation,  wastewater  tariffs,  road  safety,  and  anti-\ndesertification and thereby help sustain socioeconomic development in Jiuquan. \n \n23. \nGender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action \nplan  has  been  prepared  with  agreed  activities  and  indicators.  The  analysis  of  the  survey  and \nfocus  group  discussion  data  reveals  that  women  are  affected  by  poor  mobility  and  access, \ngenerally burdened with family and household responsibilities, and employed in low-paying jobs. \nImproving  sanitary  conditions  through  expanded  wastewater  services  will  benefit  women  by \nreducing  illness  and  associated  time  and  cost  burdens.  Improvements  to  urban  transport  and \nattention  to the  needs  of  women  in  the  planning  of  public  transport,  pedestrian,  nonmotorized \ntransport access, and road safety programs will benefit women by increasing access, mobility, \nand safety, reducing time and cost burdens, and improving productivity. The healthier ecological \nenvironment and green space will provide recreational areas for women and children. Women\u2019s \nparticipation in windbreak plantation, education trail design, various public awareness activities, \nand public hearings on the wastewater tariff will strengthen the effectiveness of project activities \nand bolster project sustainability. The gender action plan includes specific targets for women in \nemployment,  participation,  and  capacity-building  opportunities,  and  is  supported  by  a  loan \nassurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\nis  environment  category  B.  An \n\n24. \ninitial  environment \nexamination\u2014prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nposted  on  the  ADB  website\u2014concludes  that  the  project  will  have  substantial  environmental \nbenefits  and  that  its  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  through  the \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). Construction and operation of the project components \nhave  potential  impacts  on  the  environment,  but  these  are  site-specific,  reversible,  and  not \nunprecedented.  Dust  and  noise  generated  by  construction  activities  could  be  a  nuisance  to \nnearby  residents  unless  mitigated.  Discharge  of  wastewater  from  construction  sites  could \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fpotentially pollute nearby water bodies. Traffic on the project roads could generate air and noise \npollution  that  may  affect  nearby  sensitive  receptors.  Operation  of  the  WWTP  could  generate \nodor  and  noise  impacts.  Environmental  management  measures  defined  in  the  EMP,  such  as \nsound  construction  site  management  and  regular  monitoring  of  the  project\u2019s  environmental \nperformance during construction and operation, will reduce these impacts to acceptable levels. \nJMG will be responsible for the overall implementation and compliance with the EMP, including \ninspection,  monitoring,  reporting,  and  corrective  actions  or  measures.  Contractors  as  well  as \nJEDIC  during  construction,  and  facility  operators  during  operation,  will  implement  the  EMP \nmeasures.  Environmental  management  is  supported  by  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project  and  loan  covenants.  JMG  disclosed  relevant \nenvironment  information  to  potentially  affected  people,  and  the  results  and  findings  of  the \nconsultation process were used to modify the initial environmental examination and finalize the \nthroughout  project \nproject  design.  Consultations  and  public  participation  will  continue \nimplementation. Environmental complaints will be handled in accordance with the environment \ngrievance redress mechanism developed for the project. The EMP is in Annex 1 of the PAM. \n \nResettlement. The project is resettlement category A. A total of 897 mu of land will be \n25. \npermanently acquired, including 609 mu of collective land and 288 mu of state-owned land.20 A \nfurther 351 mu of state-owned land will be temporarily occupied during project implementation. \nLand acquisition will affect  138 households with 547 persons.21 A total of 5,624 square meters \n(m2) of rural residences and 21,580 m2 of nonresidential structures will be demolished, affecting \n22  households  with  88  persons,  and  21  enterprises  with  162  employees.  A  resettlement  plan \nwas  prepared  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  endorsed  by  JMG, \ndisclosed  to  affected  people  in  the  local  language,  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website.  The \nresettlement  plan  will  be  finalized  in  line  with  the  detailed  engineering  design  and  detailed \nmeasurement survey, disclosed to affected people in the local language, and submitted to ADB \nfor  approval  before  awarding  civil  works  contracts.  Compensation  for  lost  assets  and \nresettlement  allowances  will  be  paid  to  affected  people,  and  livelihood  rehabilitation  will  be \narranged  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement  plan  before  starting  the  related  civil  works.  The \nproject  management  office  and  JEDIC  will  assume  responsibility  for  planning,  implementing, \nfinancing, and reporting on land acquisition and resettlement. A grievance  redress mechanism \nwas established. \n \n26. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  indigenous  peoples  category  C.  In  Jiuquan  city, \nethnic minorities make up about 1.6% of the population. They are socially and economically well \nintegrated and will benefit from the project activities as much as the mainstream population. The \nproject  will  not  have  any  impact  on  the  dignity,  human  rights,  traditional  lands,  or  culture  of \nethnic  minorities.  No  buildings  with  cultural  or  religious  significance  to  ethnic  minorities  are  in \nthe project area. The project will not have any direct impact on their livelihoods. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.22 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \n \n\n                                                \n20 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2). \n21  Of these, 78 households with 297 persons will be seriously affected, losing more than 10% of their productive land.  \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nImplementation delays due \nto the limited experience of \nthe PMO and JEDIC in \nprojects financed by \nmultilateral agencies \n\nDelay in land acquisition \nand resettlement  \n\nUnsustainable operation \nand maintenance of \ninfrastructure components \ndue to lack of capacity or \nbudget \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nJMG has hired a qualified tendering agent with ADB procurement experience.    \nThe project will provide consulting services for technical support and on-the-\njob trainings in procurement, disbursement, and financial management. \n\nJMG has established rapport with the implementing agencies of previous ADB \n\nurban sector projects in Gansu to learn about ADB guidelines and \nprocedures.  \n\nJMG will make available for and timely release of funds for compensation \n\nunder its fiscal budget as per loan covenant.  \n\nThe project will support (i) initial project implementation by engaging a \nresettlement expert to assist in detailed measurement surveys and \nresettlement plan finalization, and (ii) independent resettlement monitoring \nto ensure compliance. \n\nJMG will ensure adequate staff resources and annual operation and \n\nmaintenance budget as per loan covenants. \n\nThe project will provide (i) infrastructural support for management \n\nimprovement such as wastewater system monitoring, road maintenance, \nand traffic management; and (ii) institutional support for prudent \noperational practices and trainings. \n\nDelay in tariff increase \n\nJMG will implement a phased tariff increase to achieve full cost recovery by \n\nThe project will provide institutional support for annual tariff reviews and \n\n2027 as per loan covenant.  \n\npublic awareness program. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JEDIC = Jiuquan Economic Development and Investment Company, JMG = \nJiuquan municipal government, PMO = project management office.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n28. \nThe  government,  Gansu  provincial  government,  and  JMG  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the  PAM and loan documents.
