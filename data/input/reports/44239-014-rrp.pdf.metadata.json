The \nadditional  financing  will  further  strengthen  safety  and  security,  and  improve  passenger \nconvenience  in  terms  of  level  of  service  at  these  airports.  The  overall  project  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  plan  to  develop  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  air  transport  system  connecting \nurban and rural centers to help overcome the limitations of road transport, improve accessibility, \nand promote tourism and high-value agriculture in less-developed regions of the country. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nBhutan  is  a  mountainous,  landlocked  country  with  its  socioeconomic  development \nlargely  depending  on  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  transport  network.  The  country  has  an \nestimated population of 745,000 and a population density of 19 persons per square kilometer, \nwhich is the smallest population and the lowest  population density in South Asia.2 Bhutan falls \nwithin  a  seismic  risk  zone  with  a  moderate  to  high  risk  level,  and  has  formidable  weather \nconditions.  This  makes  it  difficult  for  the  country  to  achieve  economies  of  scale  in  service \ndelivery,  and  costly  to  build  and  maintain  physical  infrastructure,  particularly  roads.  The  high \nexternal  and domestic transport  costs  and lack of  or  limited  accessibility  have constrained the \ncountry\u2019s economic and social development. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan,  2013\u20132018,  highlights  the  development \n4. \nobjectives for the country, focusing on sustainable and equitable socioeconomic development.3 \nTo help achieve the objectives, the government decided to develop a safe, reliable, and efficient \nnetwork  of  domestic  air  transport  connecting  urban  and  rural  centers.  In  keeping  with  this \nstrategy, the government started development and improvement of three domestic airports\u2014in \nBumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. \n \n5. \nAir  transport  activity  in  Bhutan  is  set  to  increase  substantially  as  a  result  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  continued  effort  to  brand  and  market  tourist  attractions  in  the  country.  The \nhistorical  trend  for  total  tourist  arrivals  to  Bhutan  has  shown  strong  growth,  with  total  visitor \narrivals  increasing  from  23,480  in  2009  to  133,480  in  2014,  or  a  41.6%  increase  per  year  on \naverage.4 In  view  of  the  anticipated  increase  in  aircraft  movements  and  passenger  volume, \nthere is an urgent need to strengthen safety and security, and enhance the capacity of domestic \nairports.  \n \n\n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015.

ADB financed \nthe  original  project  through  a  grant  of  $6.92  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  The \ngovernment financed $0.68 million of taxes and duties and office accommodation.  \n \n7. \n\nThe original project is performing well based on the following assessment:7 \n(i) \n\nimplementation  progress \n\nimplementation  progress.  The \n\nDelivery  of  expected  outputs. The delivery of expected outputs is satisfactory. \nAll  civil  works  at  Bumthang  and  Gelephu  domestic  airports  were  completed  by \nApril 2015. Remaining civil works in Yonphula will be completed by October 2016, \nbefore the financial closing on 31 December 2016. The original project is on track \nto  meet  the  intended  outcome  of  improved  safety,  security,  and  capacity  at  the \nthree domestic airports. \nis \nSatisfactory \nsatisfactory. As of March 2016, all contracts had been awarded with a cumulative \namount  of  $6.90  million  (99%  of  the  total  grant).  The  cumulative  disbursement \nwas $4.24 million (61% of the total grant). \nrequirements.  The \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy \ncompliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  is  satisfactory.  Environmental \nin \nand  social  safeguards  mitigation  measures  have  been \ncompliance  with  the  grant  covenants  and  the  mitigation  measures  described  in \nthe  environmental  management  plan,  the  resettlement  plan,  and  contract \nspecifications. \nSuccessful management of risks. The risks have been successfully managed. \nThe design and supervision consultant team, including international and national \nspecialists,  has  effectively  supported  the  government\u2019s  project  implementation \nunit by preparing bidding documents and bid evaluation reports, and supervising \ncontract execution. \nOn  track  rating.  The  original  project  has  been  rated  on  track  in  the  project \nperformance rating since the grant effectiveness. \n \n\nimplemented \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  original  project resolved  deficiencies in basic  infrastructure such  as lack  of  aircraft \n8. \nparking aprons and taxiways, security fencing, and car parks. Aircraft parking apron and taxiway \nexpansion has enabled an increase in the number of flights during the rainy seasons. Security \nfencing has prevented live animals from entering into the airport area. All-weather car parks and \naccess  roads  have  improved  the  level  of  service  for  passengers  and  aviation  staff.  The \ninstallation  of  drainage  and  flood  protection  systems  has  mitigated  the  environmental  risk  of \nflooding and operational hazards posed by the unfavorable terrain. \n \n\n                                                \n5  ADB.  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the \n\nKingdom of Bhutan for the Air Transport Connectivity Enhancement Project. Manila (Grant 0295-BHU). \n\n6  Project  output  performance  indicators  at  appraisal  included  basic  infrastructure  improvement  such  as  perimeter \nfencing,  runway  asphalt  overlay,  runway  repair,  access  road,  and  terminal  expansion.  In  the  course  of  project \nimplementation, some indicators have been added, deleted, or changed. \n\n7  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fBased on lessons from similar projects in the region, regulatory and institutional capacity \n9. \nis critical to ensuring sustainable development of air transport in the country. Separation of the \nregulatory and operational functions of the Department of Civil Aviation took place in April 2015; \nwhich was supported by ADB technical assistance approved on 5 December 2011.8 The Bhutan \nCivil  Aviation  Authority  serves  as  the  regulator  while  the  Department  of  Air  Transport  (DOAT) \noperates and maintains airports. As a result, DOAT is serving as the project implementation unit \nwhile the Ministry of Information and Communications (MOIC) remains the executing agency for \nthe original project. \n \n10. \nDespite  progress,  security  and  service  level  at  the  airports  remains  deficient.  The \nexisting passenger terminal in Bumthang has limited capacity and requires expansion. Aviation \nsecurity  staff  in  Gelephu  have  no  accommodation  facility  within  the  airport  boundary.  In \nYonphula, the aircraft apron is elevated by  1 meter from the ground level, posing a safety risk \nfor  passengers.  The  additional  financing  will  address  these  deficiencies  and  support  the \nchanges  in  project  scope  to  further  improve  security  and  service.  It  will  help  consolidate \ndevelopment  outcomes  by  providing  physical  infrastructure  within  the  airport  boundaries. \nOverall, the project meets eligibility criteria for additional financing. The additional financing will \nenhance  the  intended  impact  of  the  original  project  by  utilizing  the  existing  implementation \narrangements, achieving results expeditiously. \n \nThe  overall  project  is  in  line  with  the  strategic  objective  of  providing  safe  and  more \n11. \nefficient  movement  of  people  and  goods  as  described  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2014\u20132018.9 The  proposed  additional  financing  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business \nplan,  2016\u20132018. 10  Investments  in  developing  a  safe,  reliable,  and  efficient  domestic  air \ntransport  network  connecting  urban  and  rural  centers  were  identified  as  priorities  for  the \ntransport  sector  and  are  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  strategies  for  development  of  the \ntransport sector. \n \nRegional  connectivity.  The  government\u2019s  initiative  to  develop  international  and \n12. \ndomestic air transport networks will contribute to tourism growth in Bhutan. International visitors \nwho  travel  to  domestic  tourism  destinations  currently  must  travel  by  road.  Improved  air \nconnectivity  will  provide  more  variety  of  transport  modes  to  reach  domestic  destinations,  and \nenable  the  marketing  of  tourist  attractions  to  diversified  visitor  segments.  The  project  will \nimprove  accessibility  to  less-developed  regions  of  the  country.  This  will  help  facilitate  greater \nand more equitable coverage of potential benefits from tourism growth. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nThe  overall  aggregate  impact  will  be  improved  air  transport  connectivity.  The  overall \naggregate outcome will be improved safety, security, and capacity at three domestic airports in \nBumthang, Gelephu, and Yonphula. The impact and outcome statements are unchanged from \nthe original project. \n \n \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                \n8  ADB.  2011.

To  enhance  resilience  to  climatic  hazards  and  disasters,  built-in  civil  engineering \nmeasures will be assessed and applied, including flood protection structures, design values of \nstorm  frequency  and  runoff,  and  drainage  systems.  Hydrological  considerations  will  be \nheightened in consultation with the government\u2019s hydro-meteorological services division.  \n \n20. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  DOAT\u2019s  Technical  Support  Division,  which  comprises \nfour  sections\u2014civil,  electrical,  mechanical,  and  horticulture  and  beautification\u2014is  currently \nproviding adequate maintenance services for Bhutan\u2019s airport facilities. With minimum staffing, it \nrelies  on  external  local  contractors  for  several  maintenance  functions  including  some  major \nmaintenance activities for airside facilities such as the runway, taxiways, and apron. For current \nand future maintenance requirements for the domestic airports, DOAT has assigned six full-time \nmaintenance  staff\u2014two  stationed  at  each  airport  in  Bumthang  and  Gelephu,  and  two  at  the \nYonphula  airport  once  domestic  air  service  operations  recommence.  Additional  and  more \nspecialized maintenance staff are seconded from Paro International Airport when and if required. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nThe economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.13 The proposed additional financing will provide a new terminal \nfacility  and associated  infrastructure, together  with the  ongoing  project  which improved  safety, \nsecurity,  and  capacity  at  the  three  domestic  airports.  The  overall  project  will  help  ensure \noperation  of  aircraft  types  with  adequate  capacity  for  continued  passenger  traffic  growth  and \nimproved service and safety.14 The economic benefits are derived from the air traffic that will be \ngenerated. Economic benefits will include (i) an increase in tourist spending derived from longer \nstays in the country as more regions are connected by air, and additional tourist arrivals to the \ncountry as a result of better accessibility to more parts of the country; (ii) travel time savings for \ndomestic air passengers; (iii) aeronautical revenues received by the airport from new traffic; and \n(iv)  improved  aircraft  utilization  by  the  airline  operator.  The  total  benefit  generated  by  the \ndomestic  airport  development  was  apportioned  according  to  the  investment  made  for  airport \ndevelopment. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the overall project is estimated at \n15.5%. A sensitivity analysis tested the effects of possible unfavorable scenarios resulting from \nchanges  in  the  key  parameters  that  determine  the  project\u2019s  costs  and  benefits.  The  analysis \nindicates  that  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  would  remain  satisfactory  even  under  adverse \nscenarios,  and  that  a  cost  increase  of  52%  for  the  components  under  additional  financing  or \ndecrease  in  benefits of 21%  would be required  to reach  the  cutoff EIRR of  12%. The  EIRR of \nthe additional financing alone is 16.1%. \n \n22. \nThe  financial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  project \ninvestment based on revenues from the domestic airport improvements covering the capital and \noperating  costs.  Based  on  the  financial  projections  and  evaluation,  the  project  is  financially \nsustainable  and  will  generate  sufficient  revenue  to  meet  the  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditure  and  partially  recover  the  investment  made.  However,  the  rate  of  return  on  the \noverall project is negligible. The economic analysis demonstrates social and economic benefits \nfrom improved accessibility, including substantial tourism growth potential and local employment \ngeneration.15 \n \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997.

DOAT is responsible for the development and \nmanagement  of  Bhutan\u2019s  airports  and the  operation  and maintenance  of  the  country\u2019s  airports \nand  airfields.  The  DOAT  director  reports  to  the  secretary  of  the  MOIC.  DOAT  has  sufficient \ncapacity to undertake infrastructure improvements with past project experience funded primarily \nby  bilateral  development  partners.  Supported  by  ADB  capacity  development  technical \nassistance  (footnote  8),  a  new  Civil  Aviation  Act  and  applicable  Bhutan  air  navigation \nregulations to reflect  current needs  have been  prepared,  effective separation of  the  regulatory \nand  operating  functions  of  the  Department  of  Civil  Aviation  has  taken  place,  and  technical \ntraining in the critical areas of regulatory oversight and airport operations have been provided to \nDOAT staff, which contributed to further improvement of institutional capacity. \n \n24. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects16 and \nthe  Financial  Due  Diligence:  A  Methodology  Note.17 The  financial  management  assessment \nconsidered  the  capacity of  DOAT,  including funds flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting and \nfinancial  reporting  systems,  financial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing \narrangements.  Based  on  the  assessment,  DOAT  will  include  a  suitably  qualified  accountant \nofficer in the project implementation unit. It is concluded that the overall premitigation financial \nmanagement  risk  of  DOAT  is  moderate.  With  the  proposed  action,  the  overall  financial \nmanagement arrangements are considered satisfactory, and the overall risk is moderate. \n \n25. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  All  procurement  of  works  and  goods  will  follow \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  National  competitive \nbidding  will  follow  the  government\u2019s  Procurement  Rules  and  Regulations  (2009)  with  the \nclarifications  and  modifications  described  in  the  procurement  plan.  Under  the  government\u2019s \nProcurement  Rules and Regulations (2009),  the Public  Procurement  Policy  Division  under  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  is  the  oversight  agency  for  public  procurement  in  the  country  and  is \nmandated,  among  other  things,  to  make  recommendations  to  the  government  to  oversight \nreform of the procurement policy or laws, prepare standard bidding documents, issue technical \nguidelines  and  manuals  on  procurement,  liaise  with  government  organizations  to  develop \nhuman  resources  and  professionalism  in  procurement,  and  act  as  the  central  counterpart  for \nany procurement-related issues in connection with donors. The regulations also recognize that \ndonor rules and procedures on procurement may prevail in the case of donor-funded projects. \nThe Anti-Corruption Commission under the Anti-Corruption Act of Bhutan, enacted in 2006, has \nauthority  to  take  necessary  actions  to  prevent  and  combat  corruption,  investigate  acts  of \ncorruption whenever there is evidence of corruption, sanction corrupt firms from participating in \ngovernment  bids,  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  national  anticorruption  strategy.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in \nthe PAM (footnote 12). Preparation of detailed design and bidding documents for the additional \nfinancing components is in progress, funded by the original project. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nPoverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  Bhutan\u2019s  poverty  rates  have  been  significantly \nreduced  from  31.7%  in  2003  to  12.0%  in  2012  because  of  economic  growth  and  the \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n16 ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s  2013  country  diagnostic \nstudy for  Bhutan  identified  poor  connectivity  in rural  areas  and  limited  opportunities for  decent \nemployment  as key  factors  contributing  to  poverty  and  inequality.18 The  project  is  expected  to \nincrease  accessibility  and  create  income-generating  opportunities  for  the  estimated  100,000 \nresidents  living  in  Bumthang,  Sarpang,  and  Trashigang  districts,  where  the  airports  are \nlocated. 19 The  project  is  expected  to  support  the  development  of  trade  and  businesses  in \ngeneral  and  the  tourism  sector  in  Bumthang  in particular.  Project  beneficiaries  include  DOAT; \nthe households expected to occupy the new staff quarters at Gelephu; and the businesses and \nvisitors related to trade, tourism, and services sectors. \n \n27. \nGender.  The  new  terminal  at  Bumthang  will  include  universal  design  features  such  as \nsegregated  toilets  for  men  and  women  and  accessibility  ramps.  Moreover,  the  project  will \nbenefit the existing 13 female staff working in the three airports, and the prospected  eight staff \nto  be  hired  shortly.  Consultations  with  104  women  and  a  sample  survey  on  200  households \nwere  conducted  in  2011  as  part  of  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  prepared  under  the \noriginal project. Most women consulted, whose primary income comes from selling agricultural \nand dairy products, viewed the development of the airports positively and were looking forward \nto  the  ensuing  business  and  income-generation  opportunities  derived  from  an  increase  in \ngeneral business and tourist numbers. \n \nSexually  Transmitted  Infections.  The  National  Sexually  Transmitted  Infections  (STI), \n28. \nHIV  and  AIDS  Prevention  and  Control  Programme   is  a  multisector  initiative  involving  all \nsections  of  society  in  Bhutan  and  has  been  operating  since  1988,  assisted  by  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  development  agencies  and  the  United  Nations.  The  government  has  been \nsuccessful  in  carrying  out  awareness  campaigns  to  prevent  the  health  risks  associated  with \ninfrastructure  development.  Meanwhile,  under  the  project,  contractors  will  carry  out  STI/HIV \nawareness activities for laborers at work sites, which will be monitored by supervision consultant. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n1. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n\n \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  is  categorized  C  for  involuntary \n29. \nresettlement.  Social  due  diligence  of  social  impacts  related  to  the  additional  financing  was \nconducted  during  project  preparation  and  confirmed  that  all  civil  works  will  be  built  within \nDOAT\u2019s  property  boundaries,  will  not  affect  private  assets,  and  will  not  cause  physical  and \neconomic  displacement.  A  social  compliance  review  of  the  ongoing  investment,  which  was \ncategorized  B  for  resettlement  impacts,  was  also  conducted.  It  confirmed  that  the  household \naffected  by  land  acquisition  in  Gelephu  was  compensated  as  per  the  disclosed  resettlement \nplan  and  that  a  stupa  at  Yonphula  was  successfully  relocated. 20 However,  it  also  identified \npending  actions  to  address  impacts  associated  with  the  original  development  of  the  airports \nunder the Government of Bhutan\u2019s own financing, such as the finalization of the compensation \nof  one  household  and  the  reconstruction  of  a  footbridge  in  Bumthang  as  well  as  the \nidentification of an alternative footpath in Yonphula. DOAT agreed on an action plan to address \n\n                                                \n18  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  2013. \n\nCountry Diagnostic Studies: Bhutan\u2014Critical Development Constraints.

More information can be found in the Safeguards Compliance Report disclosed on \nthe ADB website.21 \n \n30. \nImpact  on  indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  people  in  the  project  area. \nThe  civil  works  under  the  additional  financing  will  not  affect  any  person  and  the  project  is \ncategorized C for indigenous peoples. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n31. \nThe  additional  financing  is  for  construction  of  a  new  terminal  building  at  Bumthang \nairport,  security  staff quarters  at Gelephu  airport,  and  a  low  safety  barrier  at  Yonphula  airport. \nThese activities do not involve major civil works and will all be undertaken within the boundaries \nof the existing airport facilities. Given this, anticipated environmental impacts of the project are \nlow  and,  therefore,  the  project  is  classified  B  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (SPS)  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  report  has  been  prepared \nfor the proposed construction of the three structures under the project and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite. A safeguards compliance audit has been carried out for the original project, as required \nby the SPS for existing facilities, as the proposed structures under the project are being added \nto the existing airports. The safeguards compliance report is also disclosed on the ADB website. \nAnticipated  environmental  impacts,  which  will  mainly  occur  during  the  construction  stage,  are \noccupational health and safety issues, generation of construction waste, generation of dust and \nnoise, and problems of siltation.  Solid and liquid waste from the operation of the two buildings \nwill  be  the main operational-stage  issue that  will  need to be managed.  Mitigation measures to \naddress these issues have been recommended in the IEE and the environmental management \nplan,  which  will  form  part  of  the  bidding  documents  for  contractors.  Consultations  with \nconcerned  stakeholders  and  communities  have  been  completed  while  preparing  the  IEE.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism has been proposed to address stakeholder and local community \nconcerns during project construction.  \n \n32. \nThe  institutional  system  under  the  original  project  will  continue  to  be  followed  for  the \nadditional financing components. DOAT\u2019s director will serve as the  project director responsible \nfor  overall  implementation  of  environmental  safeguards.  The  project  manager  for  each  airport \nwill serve as the on-site focal point for environmental safeguards under the DOAT director. The \nsupervision  consultant  team  will  include  an  environment  specialist  to  monitor  contractor \ncompliance. Annual environmental monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB for \ndisclosure  on  the  ADB  website,  as  required  by  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for \nenvironment category B projects. \n \nF. \n \n33.
