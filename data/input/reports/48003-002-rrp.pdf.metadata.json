Instead \nof  coal,  the  system  will  use  natural  gas,  solar  thermal,  shallow-ground geothermal,  and  waste \nheat recovered from industrial plants as its energy sources.2 The project will also demonstrate a \nlow-temperature  district  energy  distribution  network  and  combine  it  with  a  smart  energy \nmanagement  system.3 The  project  system  is  expected  to  lower  energy  intensity  by  40%  and \ncarbon intensity by 64% from the averages achieved by  comparable standard systems now in \nuse in the northern PRC.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nQingdao  is  in  Shandong  Province  in  the  northeast  of  the  PRC  where  winter \ntemperatures  drop  to  as  low  as  \u201317  degrees  Celsius  (oC)  and  are  typically  below  zero  for  5 \nmonths  a  year.  Heating  is  therefore  an  essential  service  for  public  health  and  well-being  and \nsustaining people\u2019s livelihoods. Demand for heating grew along with urbanization at an average \nrate of 11% a year during 2011\u20132014 in Qingdao. The city air has become hazy and polluted in \nthe  winter,  a  problem  common  in  the  PRC\u2019s  urban  regions.  According  to  the  local  air  quality \nmonitoring  system,  the  average  annual  fine  particulate  matter  concentration  in  2014  was  84 \nmicrograms  per  cubic  meter  (\u00b5g/m3),  more  than  8  times  the  level  recommended by  the World \nHealth  Organization.5 It  is  estimated  that  on  winter  days  40%  of  this  particulate  matter  comes \nfrom burning coal.  \n \n4. \nCoal-based heating is a major cause of  rising levels of  outdoor and indoor air pollution \nduring the winter months and the growing risk of respiratory and heart diseases that results. The \nsick, children, the elderly, and the poor are affected the most. In June 2013, the Government of \nthe PRC issued a policy on 10 air pollution prevention and control measures, which included the \nreduction of  coal  use  and  greater  use  of  natural gas and  renewable energy.  In  July  2013,  the \nQingdao municipal government (QMG) developed a comprehensive policy for urban air pollution \nreduction,  which  included  a  ban  on  the  use  of  coal  in  district  energy  systems  for  new  and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Shallow-ground  geothermal  technology  uses  the  earth  as  a  heat  source  in  the  winter  and  a  heat  sink  in  the \nsummer for heating and cooling systems. The project will use waste heat recovered from both industrial plants and \nmunicipal sewage plants. \n\n3  Instead  of  keeping  the  prevailing  flow  temperature  of  water  at  75  degree  Celsius  (oC)  and  return  temperature  of \nwater at 55oC in the distribution network for heat, the project will employ current best practice of flow temperature \nof  water  at  50oC  and  return  temperature  of  water  at  40oC  in  the  network,  which  is  extensively  used  in  many \nEuropean countries. The smart energy management system will optimize energy supply by responding to real-time \ndemand. \n\n4  Compared with the average energy intensity of 0.56 gigajoules per square meter (m2) in the PRC, the project will \nachieve  0.35  gigajoules per m2.  Compared  with  the  70  kilograms  of  carbon  emissions per  m2  produced  by coal-\nbased systems, the project system will produce 20 kilograms per m2. \n\n5  In 2014, the average concentration of fine particles (of less than 2.5 micrometers) in some large PRC cities, which \n3 in \nhave drawn much national and international attention, was 95 \u03bcg/m\nTianjin.  Air  pollution  in  Qingdao  is  equally  severe.  In  contrast,  the  average  concentration  is  22  \u00b5g/m3  in  Metro \nManila in the Philippines and 10 \u00b5g/m3 in Yokohama in Japan. \n\n3 in Beijing, and 83 \u03bcg/m\n\nin Hebei, 86 \u03bcg/m\n\n3 \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nadditional  heating  areas,  and  a  plan  to  eliminate  the  use  of  coal  over  time  in  urban  areas.  In \nJanuary 2014, the PRC set new targets for provinces to reduce air pollution by 5%\u201325% during \n2015\u20132020.  The  United  Kingdom,  where  smog  rose  to  serious  levels  in  London  in  1952, \nshowed that a rapid switch from the use of coal to gas as a basic energy fuel can greatly reduce \nair pollution.6 \n \n5. \nQingdao  was  selected  as  pilot  city  for  low-carbon  development  by  the  government\u2019s \nNational Development and Reform Commission in December 2012. One-third of carbon dioxide \nemissions  in  the  city  come  from  residences  and  the  heating  industry,  many  of  which  still  use \ncoal-based  systems  and  high-loss  heating  networks.7 This  makes  the  replacement  of  boilers \nand  centralized  district  heating  networks  using  coal  with  decentralized  systems  using  natural \ngas  and  renewable  sources  a  high  priority  of  Qingdao  in  the  effort  to  reduce  carbon  dioxide \nemissions.8 \n \n6. \nThe district heating systems in the PRC also tend to overheat buildings, which leads to \nsignificant energy loss through the building envelope. This happens because heat suppliers do \nnot know and cannot react to the customer demand for heat in real time. Use of a smart energy \nmanagement system will prevent overheating, save energy, and improve the quality of heating \nservice.  These  systems  provide  interactive  communications  and  energy  control  between  heat \nsuppliers and customers to indicate and meet household demand. \n \n7. \nThe  project  design  (para.  2)  responds  directly  to  the  urgent  national,  provincial,  and \nmunicipal  government  priorities  to  develop  low-carbon  cities  and  reduce  urban  air  pollution \n(paras. 4\u20136). When the project is completed, the design can be replicated in other major cities to \nbring  their  systems  in  line  with  current  international  best  practices  for  achieving  energy \nefficiency.9 By  providing  cleaner  district  energy  services  and  improving  air  quality,  the  project \nwill  directly  benefit  about  half  a  million  people  in  the  project  area,  or  about  15%  of  the  city\u2019s \nurban population, as well as commercial enterprises and public agencies. It will indirectly benefit \nthe residents  of  the  other  parts  of  Qingdao  by  removing  some of the sources of  pollution  now \nemanating from the project area. \n \n8. \nWhile preparing the project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established a platform \nfor  an  exchange  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  between  the  Qingdao  District  Heating \nAssociation  and the  Swedish  Council  for  District  Heating  and  District  Cooling,  an  international \nleader  in  the  development  of  low-carbon  and  energy-efficient  district  heating  and  cooling \nsystems. This will help Qingdao gain knowledge of (i) district energy policies and regulations, (ii) \ndistrict  energy  technologies  and  new  applications,  and  (iii)  lessons  learned  in  other  relevant \nprojects beyond the PRC.10 In addition, to disseminate knowledge and experience gained from \n\n                                                \n6  The  World  Bank  recommends  that  natural  gas  be  used  for  heating  rather  than  coal.  World  Bank.  2007. \nEnvironmental Health and Safety Guidelines. Washington, DC. This is because it emits 50% less carbon dioxide, \n82% less nitrogen oxide, negligible particulate matters, and 98% less sulfur dioxide. A heating source using natural \ngas can be operated independently and located within the building being heated (distributed energy). \n\n7  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance to  the  People\u2019s  Republic of  China  for  Enabling  the  Protection of Jiaozhou  Bay \n\nWater Quality. Manila. \n\n8  A  decentralized  or  distributed  energy  system  can  reduce  the  amount  of  energy  lost  in  transmitting  heat  and/or \npower from where they are generated to where they are to be used because the source is within the same building \nor nearby. In addition, upgrading and/or expanding current heating pipelines to meet demand is difficult when the \nunderground space for service infrastructure is already congested.  \n\n9  It can be replicated in 180 cities in 14 provinces and  2 autonomous regions and in the municipalities of Beijing and \n\nTianjin where heating is provided by a district system. \n\n10 ADB facilitated the signing of the memorandum of understanding between the Swedish Council for District Heating \n\nand District Cooling and the Qingdao District Heating Association on 29 May 2015. \n\n\f3 \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nthe  Qingdao  project,  ADB  will  support  district  energy  conference  in  the  PRC  and  publish \nknowledge products and policy notes. \n \nThe  project  is  closely  aligned  with  (i)  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,11 which \n9. \nidentifies  environmentally  sustainable  growth  as  a  priority  for  helping  developing  member \ncountries  move  to  a  low-carbon  growth  path  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and  introducing \nrenewable  energy;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC,12 which \nidentifies  environmental  sustainability  as  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  ADB  assistance;  and  (iii) \nADB\u2019s Energy Policy,13 which prioritizes energy efficiency, renewable energy development, and \naccess to energy for all. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  impacts  will  be  (i)  greater  energy  efficiency  in  district  energy  systems,  and  (ii)  a \ndecline  in  cases  of  respiratory  and  heart  diseases.  The  outcome  will  be  the  avoidance  of \nemissions of carbon and pollutants by district energy systems in Qingdao.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  output  will  be  the  construction  of  a  smart,  distributed  district  energy  system  in \nQingdao. The key activities will be the (i) installation of  small, distributed natural gas boilers, a \nwaste  heat  recovery  system  from  sewage  plants  and  industries,  heat  pump  systems,  a  solar \nheating  system,  a  heat  storage  system,  and  low-temperature  pipelines  in  eight  locations;  (ii) \ninstallation  of  a  smart  energy  management  system  in  eight  locations;  and  (iii)  supervision  of \nproject implementation.14 The project\u2019s components and key features are summarized in Table \n1. \n \n\nOutput \n\nTable 1: Key Features of the Project by Location \n\nDistrict Name and System \nType \n\nBinhai energy system (N) \n\nHouhai energy system (N) \nLicang unit-based heating and \ncooling system (N) \nShibei heat exchange stations \n(N) \nJidong energy system \nEast Licang heating system \n(N) \nShinan unit-based heating \nand cooling system (N) \nShibei geothermal and solar \nheating system (N) \n  Total \n\nHeating \nArea \n(million \nm2) \n6.7 \n\nCooling \nArea \n(million \nm2) \n0.8 \n\nPower \nSupply \n(MWh) \n25.6 \n\nLength \nof \nPipeline \n(km) \n0.0 a \n\n0.7 \n0.1 \n\n5.0 \n\n2.1 \n\n3.1 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.1 \n\n0.3 \n0.2 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.1 \n\n1.8 \n\n59.8 \n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n22.5 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n14.0 \n0.0a \n\n47.2 \n\n27.4 \n\n28.2 \n0.0 a \n\n0.0 a \n\n18.2 \n\n107.9 \n\n116.8 \n\n  \n\nHeat Source and \nTechnologyb \nWaste heat recovery from \nindustry, gas, and sewage \nsource heat pump \nGas \n\nGas \n\nGas \n\nGas \n\nGas \n\nGas and absorption heat \npump \nUnderground source heat \npump and solar thermal \n\n                                                \n11 ADB. 2014.

An assessment of the heat sources available for the project \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNatural  gas. The project will consume an estimated 155 million cubic meters of \nnatural gas annually, equivalent to less than 2% of the gas consumed in 2014 in \nQingdao.  A  gas  supply  agreement  has  been  concluded  with  the  Qingdao \nTaineng Gas Company, a 100% subsidiary of QEG. \nSolar energy. Qingdao has good solar irradiation of 4,200\u20135,400 megajoules per \nsquare meter annually, which is suitable for solar heating. \n\n(iii)  Wastewater heat. The temperature of wastewater is 12oC\u201314oC in winter, which \nis within the range of ideal heat source temperatures (above 10oC in winter). \nGround heat. The ground temperature is stable year-round at about 15\u00b0C and is \nwithin the range of ideal heat source temperatures. \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  Waste  heat  recovery  from  industrial  plants.  Available  waste  heat  from \nindustrial  plants  is  estimated  at  240  megawatt-thermal  equivalent,  and  a  heat \nsupply  agreement  has  been  concluded  with  the  source  industries.  In  the  event \nthat  heat  supply  from  industrial  plants  is  interrupted,  natural  gas  boilers  to  be \ninstalled under the project will provide backup. \n\n \n20. \nThe  technical  due  diligence  confirmed  that  the  use  of  these  diverse  heat  sources  is \nviable and that the envisioned project methods have been applied successfully in Germany and \nScandinavian  countries. 17  However,  QEG\u2019s  limited  experience  in  this  technology  poses \nperformance risks. To mitigate these risks, technical consultants engaged under the project and \na  local  design  institute  with  experience  in  the  technical  design  of  an  advanced  district  energy \n\n                                                \n17 The applications include (i) combined, natural gas-based cooling, heating, and power; (ii) waste heat recovery from \nindustrial  and  municipal  sewage  plants;  (iii)  underground  heat  pumps;  (iv)  absorption  heat  pumps;  and  (v)  solar \nthermal. \n\n\f7 \n\nsystem  will  help  QEG  in  reviewing  and  optimizing  the  systems\u2019  technical  design  and  in \nsupervising project implementation (para. 19). \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  include  those  provided  by  a  more  efficient \nheating  system  and  environmental  improvements.  An  economic  analysis  considered  all  the \nproject-related  costs,  benefits  from  cost  savings  from  the  use  of  alternative  fuels  and  system \nefficiency  improvements,  and  local  and  global  environmental  benefits.  The  project\u2019s  estimated \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  was  16.81%  without  the  environmental  benefits  and  16.98% \nwith  them,  making  the  project  economically  viable  since  both  figures  exceed  the  12.00% \neconomic  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  testing  indicated  that  the  project  would  likely  remain \nsustainable under a variety of adverse economic impacts. \n \n22. \nThe  project  will  generate  revenue  from  the  sale  of  heat,  cooling,  electricity,  and  the \ncollection  of  the  service  connection  fees  from  new  customers  in  the  project  areas.  Financial \nanalysis  of  the  project  indicated  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  10.35%,  well  above  the \nweighted  average cost  of  capital  of  2.92%.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  the  project to be  likely \nsustainable  under  several  potential  adverse  scenarios.  A  financial  performance  analysis  and \nfinancial  projections  indicated  that  QEG  has  the  financial  capacity  needed  to  provide \ncounterpart funding, service the project debt, and cover operation and maintenance costs. \n  \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nADB  has  assessed  the  financial  management  risk  of  QEG  as  moderate.  This  is  based \n23. \non  its  limited  direct  experience  in  following  ADB  disbursement  procedures,  which  could  delay \ndisbursements.18 To address the risk, QEG and QMG were given disbursement training during \nproject  preparation.  More  training  will  follow  during  implementation,  and  the  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  are  deemed  adequate  with  these  mitigation  measures.  QMG  has \nestablished  a  good  track  record  in  financial  management  while  implementing  several  other \nADB-financed projects.19  \n \nAn  assessment  of  QEG  procurement  capacity  showed  it  to  have  the  skilled  and \n24. \nexperienced  staff  and  well-established  procedures  and  systems  needed \nto  manage \nprocurement  in  a  manner  consistent  with  ADB  requirements. 20  Staff  received  procurement \ntraining three times during the project preparation period, and QEG has conducted international \ncompetitive bidding for other projects financed by foreign development partners. QEG engaged \na tendering agency with good experience on 15 June 2015 specifically for this project, and ADB \n\n                                                \n18 The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  under  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  in  May \n2015.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSocial  benefits.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  420,000  people  in the  project  area,  of \n26. \nwhom  about  210,000  are  female  and  7,495  are  from  poor  households.  It  will  provide  direct \nbenefits to 22,000 children in 15 schools and an additional 7,000 in 55 kindergartens, as well as \npatients and medical staff in 7 hospitals. The project will (i) reduce cases of respiratory diseases \nby improving indoor and outdoor air quality, (ii) reduce carbon monoxide poisoning by providing \nsafer  district  heating  services,  (iii)  provide  a  better  medical  environment  by  providing  cleaner \nand  more  reliable  heating  services,  (iv)  improve  living  conditions  by  providing  adequate  and \nreliable heating services, (v) reduce household spending on heating by shifting consumers from \nthe  use  of  stoves  and  decentralized  heating  systems  to  centralized  energy-efficient  heating \nsystems, (vi)  provide  a better  learning  environment for  students  during the  winter  by  providing \nschools with cleaner and more reliable heating services, and (vii) increase income through the \ncreation of 350 temporary jobs during construction. \n \nGender impact. The project\u2019s gender category is some gender elements. Its benefits for \n27. \nwomen will include (i) access to a reliable, cleaner, and safer heating system; (ii) an easing of \nthe  domestic  chores  related  to  space  heating  (1  hour  per  day);  (iii)  a  reduced  incidence  of \nrespiratory  diseases  related  to  indoor  air  pollution;  and  (iv)  a  lowering  of  the  current  rate  of \ncarbon monoxide poisoning and accidental fires. \n \nThe  project  will  (i)  organize  energy  conservation-awareness  campaigns  in  partnership \n28. \nwith a women\u2019s federation at least twice during implementation, targeting all 100,000 women in \nthe  project  area  (including  11,000  female  students);  (ii)  aim  to  fill    50%  of  the  310  permanent \npositions to be created during operation with women employees; (iii) ensure that QMG provides \na  100%  subsidy  for  heating  tariffs  to  poor  households  headed  by  women  and  that  heating \ncompanies  waive  their  connection  fees  for  these  households;  and  (iv)  conduct  customer \nsatisfaction surveys in a gender-responsive manner to improve service delivery. \n \nE. \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  The  initial \n29. \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  complied  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements,  including \nthose  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  risks  during  project  construction \nidentified  by  the  IEE  included  those  related  to  (i)  noise  and  dust,  (ii)  construction  waste,  (iii) \ncommunity  disturbance  and  public  safety,  and  (iv)  occupational  health  and  safety.  It  found \npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  during  system  operation  to  be  related  to  (i)  the \nemission  of  nitrogen  oxides,  (ii)  noise,  (iii)  the  disposal  of  wastewater  from  the  heat  source \nplants, and (iv) occupational health and safety. The IEE concluded that all the construction and \noperational  risks  it  pinpointed  could  be  mitigated  by  implementing  measures  specified  by  the \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n21 The  tendering  agency  has  a  grade  A  certificate  as  an  international  tendering  agent  from  the  government  and \n\nexperience from five ADB projects and five World Bank projects currently being implemented.  \n\n\f9 \n\nenvironmental  management  plan,  monitoring  implementation,  and  assigning  institutional \nresponsibility for ensuring proper environmental management. \n \n30. \nQMG and QEG carried out meaningful consultations with the public in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  QMG  and  QEG  are  committed  to  managing  the \nenvironmental risks cited by the IEE and have agreed on a comprehensive set of environment-\nrelated  loan  covenants  and  to  participate  in  a  training  program  that  will  strongly  emphasize \nenvironmental  safeguards.  The  IEE  was  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  3  August  2015. \nto  the  affected  people.  Potential \nEnvironmental  safeguard  documents  were  disclosed \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the project. An assessment of the climate change risks posed to the \nproject  considered  them  to  be  moderate.  The  most  significant  threat  comes  from  rising  sea \nlevels, and no specific design modifications were required or justified since this will not affect the \nproject during its life span.22 \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.    The  project  is  classified  as \n31. \ncategory  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  does  not  entail \npermanent  land  acquisition,  restrictions  on  land  use,  the  demolition  of  any  structure,  or \ninvoluntary resettlement. Installing underground heating pipelines will affect only publicly owned \nroads and sidewalks for a maximum of 6 months. The project is not expected to have adverse \nimpacts  on  ethnic  minorities.  It  will  be  implemented  in  a  large  urban  area  where  a  vast \npercentage  of  people  are  members  of  the  Han  ethnic  majority,  and  where  no  significant \ndifferences exist between the lifestyles and socioeconomic status of the Han majority and ethnic \nminorities. The project site is not close to any ethnic minority towns or villages.  \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  benefits.  The  project\u2019s  completion  will  allow  QMG  to  shut  down  coal-\nfired heating systems. The project system\u2019s natural gas use will generate  an estimated annual \ncarbon  dioxide  emission  of  490,000  tons.  This  will  be  offset  by  emission  reductions  expected \nfrom QMG\u2019s low-carbon and air pollution control program.23 By using natural gas and renewable \nenergy  sources,  the  project  system  will  eliminate the  consumption  of the  537,867 tons  of  coal \nthat would occur each year under a business-as-usual scenario. This will prevent the emission \nof 1,398,456 tons of carbon dioxide, 12,909 tons of sulfur dioxide, 3,765 tons of nitrogen oxide, \nand  5,379  tons  of  particulate  matter.  Compared  with  a  traditional  heating  system,  the  project \nsystem  will  emit  53%  less  carbon  dioxide,  and  less  than  5%  of  nitrogen  oxide,  sulfur  dioxide, \nand particulate matter.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n                                                \n22 The assessment found that the project\u2019s critical structures are roughly 2\u20134 meters above the current sea level. An \naverage  sea  level  rise  of  even  1  centimeter  a  year  would  result  in  a  sea  level  only  25  centimeters  higher  than \ntoday\u2019s by the end of the project design\u2019s estimated 25-year life span. Slow-onset sea level risks can be addressed \nthrough adaptive incremental interventions. \n\n23 QMG has been implementing other low-carbon and air pollution control measures that include the (i) elimination of \nold  vehicles  and  construction  of  10  metro  lines  to  reduce  the  emissions  from  road  traffic;  (ii)  development  of \nrenewable energy (wind, solar, and  hydropower); (iii) enforced installation of desulphurization, denitrification, and \ndust  removal  facilities  in  coal-fired  power  plants  and  boilers;  (iv)  elimination  of  small  coal-fired  boilers;  and  (v) \nshutdowns of polluting industries. The progress made through these measures will be monitored during the project \nimplementation.  \n\n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe contract award may be delayed.  \n\nDisbursement could be slow.  \n\nThe project\u2019s district energy system \nachieves less than anticipated energy \nefficiency.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nADB provided procurement training to QEG during project preparation \nand will give additional training to both QEG and the tendering company \nduring implementation. \nADB will provide disbursement training to QEG and QMG during project \npreparation and implementation. \nTechnical consultants under the project will assist QEG in reviewing and \noptimizing the technical design and the specifications for the detailed \ndesign, selecting quality contractors and suppliers, and supervising \nproject implementation to ensure high probability of achieving design \nefficiency levels. \n\nAsian Development Bank = ADB, QEG = Qingdao Energy Group, QMG = Qingdao municipal government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nOverall,  the  risks  associated  with  the  project  have  been  adequately  addressed.  The \n\n \n34. \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  QMG  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n36. \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nThe government and QMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n37. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$130,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Qingdao  Smart  Low-Carbon  District \nEnergy  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n16 November 2015 \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\nThe project \nsystem achieves \nlower than \nanticipated energy \nefficiency and \nenvironmental \nperformance \nlevels \n\n \nTechnical \nspecifications \nchange due to a \nchange in energy \ndemand \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nEnergy efficiency in district energy systems improved.a  \nCases of respiratory and heart diseases decreased.a  \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome  \nCarbon and pollutant \nemission from district \nenergy system in \nQingdao avoided \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nData from the project\u2019s \nannual environmental \ncompliance report \n\nOutput \nA smart, distributed \ndistrict energy system \nconstructed in Qingdao  \n\n \nLoan review missions \nand project \nperformance reports \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy 2022 \nAnnual standard coal \nconsumption of more than \n537,867 tons avoided.
