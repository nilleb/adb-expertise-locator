However,  while  these  strict  containment  efforts  have  shielded  a \nvulnerable public health system from overburden, they disrupt a trajectory of strong and inclusive \neconomic growth, threatening the development gains achieved in the period between 2012 and \n2019.  To  mitigate  the  adverse  public  health  and  socioeconomic  effects  of  the  crisis,  the \ngovernment  adopted  a  sizable  countercyclical  expenditure  program.  The  proposed  CARES \nProgram2 aims to support the government in implementing its response package to protect the \nlives and livelihoods of Georgians, especially the poor and vulnerable segments of the population, \nwomen, and children.  \n \n\nTable 1.

Pre-shock \nRecord of sound \nmacroeconomic \nManagement \n\nThe IMF projects GDP growth in Georgia to decline to -4% in 2020 against the original estimate \nof 4.3% because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a $3.6 billion loss in economic output. \nThe economic slowdown, led by a contraction in domestic demand and investment\u2014and a sharp \ncontraction  in  tourism,  foreign  direct  investment,  trade,  and  remittances\u2014is  threatening  the \ndevelopment  gains  Georgia  achieved  in  the  period  2011\u20132019.  The  number  of  unemployed \npeople could triple which, in addition to an expected increase in loss of income by people in the \ninformal  sector,  would  significantly  threaten  the  livelihoods  of  47%  of  Georgians  who  are \nconsidered vulnerable to poverty. A protracted crisis is limiting the fiscal space needed to mitigate \nhealth  and  economic  impacts.  A  decline  of  23.3%  in  revenue  collection  against  the  original \nestimate  for  2020-led  by  a  reduction  of  1.6%  in  the  tax\u2013GDP  ratio\u2013combined  with  increased \nexpenditure under the government\u2019s Anti-Crisis Plan will widen the fiscal deficit to 8.1% against \nthe original estimate of 2.2% of GDP.  \nThe government announced a GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion) plan, to cover higher spending in the \nhealth sector; provide assistance to affected private sector entities; and support the unemployed, \npoor and vulnerable with a GEL1.035 billion  ($329 million)social assistance package. The total \nexpenditure package amounts to 7.4% of GDP, one of the highest in the region. The government \nhas  also  adopted  a  range  of  countercyclical  monetary  policy  measures  for  price  stability  and \nadequate liquidity in the financial system.   \nBefore  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Georgia\u2019s  economy  expanded  at  an  average  of  4.7%  during \n2011\u20132019 and was expected to grow by 4.3% in 2020. According to ADB and IMF forecasts for \n2020,  all  key  macro  fiscal  aggregates  were  expected  to  remain  below  their  maximum  target \nceilings, with public debt\u2013GDP a 44.5%, the fiscal deficit at 2.2% and total expenditure as a share \nof  GDP  at  28.3%.  Reforms  to  tax  administration  led  to  higher-than-anticipated  tax  revenue \ncollection, reaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019. The only significant risk faced by the authorities before \nCOVID-19  stemmed  from  inflationary  pressures,  which  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  targeted \nthrough  tightened  monetary  policy.  The  banking  industry\u2019s  performance  was  also  expected  to \nremain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality and higher \nliquidity despite marginally lower profitability. The IMF\u2019s favorable assessment letter confirm ADB \nstaff\u2019s  assessment  that  the  economic  downturn  is  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  not \nbecause of previous macroeconomic mismanagement.  \nGeorgia  has  made  credible  commitments  to  continue  its  ambitious  reform  path  despite  the \nCOVID-19 crisis under IMF and World Bank policy-based operationsb and planned policy reforms \n\n4.

Debt \nsustainability \n\nsupported by  ADB.c  In  response  to  the  crisis,  the  government  established  an  IACC  under  the \ndirection of the Prime Minister in February 2020. The IACC has taken decisive and credible steps \nto contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the recessionary impact on the economy.  The \ndeclaration of a national State of Emergency in March 2020 was followed by the publication of an \nextensive  list  of  containment  measures  and,  on  24  April  2020,  the  announcement  of  a \ncomprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience, affected businesses, and \nthe poor and vulnerable during the crisis.  \nThe  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  has  been  stable  in  recent  years,  hovering  below  45%  of  GDP. \nWidening  fiscal  imbalances  because of  COVID-19 are expected  to push  the  public debt\u2013GDP \nratio to 62.4% in 2020 but will resume a downward trend starting in 2021 towards a 51% ratio by \n2024. Despite the sharp increase in 2020, the ADB\u2019s DSAd concludes that public debt remains \nsustainable in the medium term. Financial assistance from the ADB will not aggravate Georgia\u2019s \ndebt vulnerabilities in the medium term.  \nADB  has  consulted  with  IMF  and  is  in  close  contact  with  its  relevant  staff  on  macroeconomic \nmonitoring.  IMF  has  provided  a  favorable  assessment  letter.  The  IMF  has  reached  staff-level \nagreement on augmentation and extension of the current program, helping the government meet \nshock-related needs, and build buffers. \n\n6.

Since its outbreak in December 2019, \n3. \nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly across the world. World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a \nglobal pandemic on 11 March 2020. The number of cases worldwide soared to 2,912,421 with \n203,432  deaths  worldwide  as  of  26  April  2020. 3 Georgia,  with  a  population  of  3.723  million \npeople,4 began  the  fight  against  COVID-19  on  28  January,  1  month  before  the  first  confirmed \ncase  of  infection  was  reported  on  26  February,  imported  by  a  citizen  returning  from  Iran  via \nAzerbaijan.  A  state  of  emergency  was  declared  on  21  March,  2  days  before  community \ntransmission was confirmed. As of 19 April 2020, 388 cases had been reported and four deaths \nconfirmed.5 Some 5,094 people are in a 14-day mandatory quarantine, while 547 patients remain \nunder observation in hospitals.6 If no mitigation and containment measures were adopted,  it is \nestimated  that  114,804  people  could  require  hospitalization  and  nearly  29,500  could  require \nintensive  care,  which  would  overwhelm  the  health  system. 7  The  increasing  burden  of \nnoncommunicable  diseases 8 poses  an  additional  risk  to  the  populations\u2019  vulnerability  to  the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  as  evidence  from  other  countries  suggests.

London: Imperial College London.  \n\n8  Noncommunicable diseases account for more than 81.2% of the burden of disease in Georgia, and the prevalence \n\nof risk factors such as smoking and hypertension is high. \n\n \n\n\fprevention measures and further strengthening of the health system\u2019s capacity to handle more \ncases of COVID-19 in the medium-term are needed. \n \n4. \nPublic health system\u2019s vulnerability to COVID-19. Despite significant improvements in \nrecent years, Georgia\u2019s public health system remains vulnerable to the health burden posed by \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic  and  crisis.  According  to  the  Global  Health  Security  Index,  Georgia\u2019s \nhealth capacity in clinics, hospitals and community care centers scored low: 18.3 out of 100.9 This \nis in part driven by the country\u2019s low nursing staff and hospital bed density.10 Georgia has only \n47.3 nurses per 10,000 population and 26 hospital beds per 10,000 population compared  with \nneighboring countries such as Armenia which has 42 beds per 10,000 population.11 Some 62% \nof frontline medical doctors, who are higher risk of contagion, are women.12  \n \nPre-shock  strong  economic  performance  recorded.  The  outbreak  of  COVID-19 \n5. \ndisrupted a trajectory of strong economic performance and robust macroeconomic fundamentals \nin  Georgia.  Before  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  economic  performance  was  expected  to  remain \nstrong,  with  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  forecasted  at  4.3%  for  2020  on  account  of \ngood  macroeconomic  management.  Georgia\u2019s  demonstrable  commitment  to  fiscal  discipline \ntranslated into robust macroeconomic fundamentals between 2014 and 2020. In 2019, Georgia \nachieved the lowest fiscal deficit in 10 years (at 2.2% of GDP), a historically low current account \ndeficit (at 5.1% of GDP), the lowest unemployment rate since the country\u2019s foundation (at 11.6%), \nand the lowest rate of poverty (still high at 20.1 percent, but nearly halved in comparison to 2007). \nPublic debt\u2013GDP remained under its 60% ceiling, at 44.5% and expenditure as a share of GDP \nat 28.3%. Reforms to revenue administration had led to overperformance in revenue collection, \nreaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019, and helped maintain the government\u2019s strong fiscal position even \nas it pursued ambitious public investment and social sector spending. 13 As a result, all three main \ncredit  rating  agencies  upgraded  Georgia\u2019s  sovereign  credit  rating  to  BB/Ba2  from  BB\u2013/Ba3 \nreferring to improved economic resilience and sound macroeconomic management as the main \ndriver.  Monetary  policy  interventions  and  exchange  rate  flexibility  were  expected  to  remain \neffective  in  curbing  inflationary  pressures.  The  banking  sector\u2019s  performance  was  expected  to \nremain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality and higher \nliquidity despite marginally lower profitability.14 \n \nImpact  of  COVID-19  on  the  economy.  Global  travel  restrictions,  nonpharmaceutical \n6. \ninterventions (NPIs), and the anticipation of a global economic crisis because of the COVID-19 \npandemic caused an immediate exogenous shock on the Georgian economy through four main \ntransmission channels: (i) a slowdown in tourism, (ii) trade disruptions, (iii) capital outflow, and \n(iv) an increase in the cost of finance. The tourism sector, which contributed 11.6% to GDP in \n\n \n\n9  The Global Health Security index is a comparative assessment of global health security capabilities in 195 countries.  \nIt reflects the average performance across 34 categories, which together indicate the readiness level of public health \nsystems to handle a biological threat.

Public  debt  and  budget \nbalance rules have been adhered to since their introduction.

IMF  Country  Report.  No.  19/372. \nWashington DC.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f2019, 15 was severely hit by travel restrictions and recorded a 58.6% decline in international visitor \ntrips in March 2020, year on year.16 Reduced international trade affects exports and imports.17 \nDecreased external demand is expected to shrink exports by 25.0% in 2020. Imports will reduce \nby  29.3%  and  affect  the  availability  of  intermediary  goods  for  manufacturing.  Foreign  direct \ninvestment  is  expected  to  decline  by  20.8%  in  2020,  compared  with  2019.  Remittances  are \nexpected to reduce by 15% in 2020 compared with 2019, having contracted by 9.0% in March \n2020  compared  with  March  2019. 18 The  contagion  effects  of  the  global  recessionary  shock \ncaused by COVID-19 will be significantly compounded by the effect of containment measures and \nlockdown imposed by the government since the declaration of the state of emergency in March \n2020.  These  are  likely  to  lead  to  a  sharp  decline  in  aggregate  domestic  demand, 19  which \naccounted  for  65%  of  GDP  in  2019,  and  are  expected  to  cause  cancellation  and  delays  of \ninvestments, affecting the business environment and investor confidence. Domestic production \nwill also suffer, because of NPIs and disruptions to global value chains, trade, and investment, \nthus exacerbating the recessionary economic and social impact of the crisis. Updated estimates \nby the IMF and the MOF predict the current account deficit to widen to -11.3% of GDP in 2020, \nfrom a record low of -5.1% in 2019 and an estimated -4.9% in 2020. Real GDP is expected to \ncontract by 4% in 2020\u2013a sharp downturn from the previous estimate of 4.3% growth. \n \n7. \nImpact of COVID-19 on public finances. The impact on state finances is expected to be \nsignificant. Recent estimates suggest that state revenues will decrease by $452 million in 2020 \nbecause of COVID-19. This sharp decline is driven by an expected fall in the tax\u2013GDP ratio from \n23.7% to 21.4% due to slowdown in economic activity. In turn, public expenditure will increase to \n32.9%  of  GDP,  compared  with  the  original  estimate  of  28.3%  for  2020.  Increases  in  public \nexpenditure, combined with a sharp decline in public revenue as a result of COVID-19, will widen \nthe fiscal deficit, from 2.2% to 8.1% of GDP in 2020. The public debt\u2013GDP ratio will, as a result, \nrise from 44.5% in 2019 to 62.4% in 2020 to help meet the estimated financing gap of $1.533 \nbillion that will emerge as a result of COVID-19, its impact on the economy and the cost of the \ngovernment  response.

The Economic Response to COVID-19: How \nis Georgia Handling the Challenge? Tbilisi: International School of Economics at TSU Policy Institute. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\falmost  all  industries  place  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  at  risk,  either  by  downward \nadjustments to income or working hours, or by losing their jobs. A total of 381,548 workers, or \n23% of all hired and self-employed workers, are at high risk of job loss  as a result of the COVID-\n19 crisis.23 Such sharp increases in unemployment could eradicate years of inclusive economic \ngrowth, reversing a decade-long decline in absolute poverty.24 While absolute poverty ($1.90/day) \nhas declined sharply from 12.2% in 2010 to 3.7% estimated for 2020, the effects of COVID-19 \nare expected to lead to a rise in poverty incidence to 4.3%, in a best case scenario, or 6.8%, in a \nworst  case  scenario.25 Further,  the  national  poverty  line  indicates  that  one  in  five  Georgians \n(20.1% in 2018) still lives in poverty. As of 2018, 47% of Georgians were estimated to remain \nvulnerable to poverty, with monthly incomes precariously close to the national poverty line.26 High \ndependence on labor income implies that even a small increase in the unemployment rate could \npush many households into poverty, starting with already vulnerable households.27 The loss of \nlabor income, combined with a reduction in remittances, will have a direct bearing on domestic \nconsumption and further threaten employment and incomes. The 23% of Georgians who depend \non income from informal labor for their livelihoods28 are also expected to suffer from the impact of \nCOVID-19.  \n \n9. \nThe  economic  impact  of  COVID-19  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to  gender  economic \nimbalances. As of December 2019, Georgia had 1.66 million hired and self-employed workers, \n46% of which were women.29 Recent estimates suggest that 40.6% of all female hired workers \nand 22.6% of female self-employed workers are at high risk of job loss.30 With women earning \nonly 64% of men\u2019s average earnings in 2017, potential downward adjustments to income or work \nhours would likely affect women more severely.31 Further, women comprise an estimated 60% of \nall workers in tourism, one of the most affected industries in Georgia, which accounts for 7.8% of \ntotal employment. The low average salaries for women in tourism, which were about a third of the \nnational average salaries in 2017, exacerbate the impact of a reduction in income in this industry \non women (footnote 31). 32 Finally, the expected 15% reduction in remittances is likely to impact \nwomen disproportionately, as they represent 61.8% of all remittance recipients in Georgia.33  \n \n10. \nImmediate and effective response to contain the spread of COVID-19. Acknowledging \nthe fragility of its public health system and the difficulties in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, \nGeorgia  implemented  strict  containment  measures  very  early.  On  21  March  2020,  with  47 \nconfirmed  cases  of  COVID-19,  Georgia  declared  a  state  of  emergency  and  published  a \ncomprehensive list of NPIs, including restrictions on the movement of people, public gatherings, \ncultural  and  sports  events,  as  well  as  restrictions  on  the  types  of  economic  activities  that  are \n\n \n\n23 L.

To  mitigate  the  expected  socioeconomic  impacts  of \n11. \nCOVID-19, the government adopted a comprehensive countercyclical development expenditure \nprogram. Costed at GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion), or 7.4% of GDP, the response program has a \nthreefold objective: (i) increase the public health sector\u2019s capacity to respond to the pandemic in \nthe short and medium term; (ii) minimize losses to be incurred by affected private sector entities; \nand  (iii)  limit  socioeconomic  costs  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  expanded  assistance \nprograms.  The  government\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program  has  been  drafted  within  a \ndemonstrably  sustainable  macroeconomic  background  and  will  be  implemented  through  a \nprudent budgetary framework (footnote 15). \n \n12. \nPublic  health  sector  response  to  COVID-19  (GEL350  million  or  $111  million).  The \nhealth system\u2019s capacity to cope with an increasing number of COVID-19 cases is limited. While \nthe  strict  containment  measures  adopted  by  the  government  have  been  widely  effective  in \nminimizing  the  number  of  cumulative  cases,  the  government  acknowledges  the  need  to \nstrengthen the health system\u2019s capacity in the medium-term. The health sector response revolves \naround five key areas of intervention:  \n\ni) \n\nii) \n\niii) \n\niv) \n\nv) \n\nCase  detection  and  confirmation:  The  government  will  procure  necessary \nmedical hygiene materials, COVID-19 test kits, laboratory reagents, polymerase \nchain  reaction  equipment,  and  specimen  transport  kits.  It  will  be  supported  by \ninvestment  in  information  technology  systems  for  disease  surveillance  and \ncontract tracing.35  \nIsolation  of  high-risk  individuals:  The  government  will  ensure  that  high  risk \nindividuals36 are placed in specially organized quarantine facilities. \nImproving the quality of medical care: To improve the quality of medical care \nprovided and minimize risks of infection to health personnel, the government will \ntrain at least 2,000 medical staff, procure essential medical goods and carry out \nrapid conditioning of designated public health facilities.  \nPatient  care  and  case  management:  The  government  has  committed  to \nproviding free access to all diagnostic, laboratory and treatment costs of COVID-\n19 patients in public and private facilities.37 \nInfrastructure investment: Government is investing in capacity improvements of \ndesignated  public  facilities,  including  hospitals  that  serve  a  large  internally \ndisplaced people (IDP). \n\n \n13. \nSupport  to  affected  businesses  (GEL2.11  billion  or  $671  million).  The  government \nhas committed a GEL2.11 billion ($671 million) to support most affected businesses, with a focus \non small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The government has tailored its support package to benefit \nSMEs and firms in the agriculture sector.  \n \nSupport to small and medium-sized enterprises. According to Enterprise Georgia,38 an \n14. \nestimated 99.7% of all registered firms in Georgia in 2017 were SMEs, which employed 62% of \nall formal workers and 67% of all female hired workers. 39 To avoid mass retrenchment of workers, \nthe  government  adopted  three  measures  aimed  specifically  at  improving  access  to  finance  to \nSMEs:  (i)  increasing  the  budgetary  allocation  to  the  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  by  GEL300 \nmillion($111 million) to raise the total value of co-financed loans to SMEs to GEL2 billion ($636 \nmillion);  (ii)  expanding  and  upgrading  existing  credit  enhancement  mechanisms  under  the \n\u201cProduce  in  Georgia\u201d  program,  40  which  is  expected  to  benefit  at  least  300  SMEs;  and  (iii) \nextending GEL40 million ($12.7 million) in grants to micro-entrepreneurs,41 which is expected to \nbenefit up to 5,000 entrepreneurs. In addition to these multi-sectoral measures, the government \nwill provide tax credits to SMEs in the tourism industry\u2014one of the most affected segments, where \n60% of workers are women, many of whom at high risk of job loss. This includes the deferral of \nproperty and income tax until November 2020, which is expected to benefit up to 4,500 SMEs, \nthe provision of an 80% subsidy on interest rate payments for small and medium-sized hotels42 \nfor a period of 6 months, which is expected to benefit up to 2,000 small and medium-sized hotels.  \n \n15. \nSupport to firms in the agriculture sector. Despite its relatively low contribution to GDP \n(7% in 2019), 40.9%43 of all active working age persons in Georgia work in agriculture\u201497% of \nwhom  are  self-employed  and  fall  outside  existing  support  systems. 44  Further,  low  baseline \nincomes in the sector suggest that loss of economic activity could have a disproportionately higher \nimpact on the rise in poverty incidence compared with other sectors.  As a result, measures to \nsupport firms in the agriculture sector are expected to be effective in mitigating the resurgence in \npoverty  incidence.  They  also  complement  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  increase  domestic  food \nproduction,  with  a  view  to  protecting  food  insecure  households.45 To  this  end,  the  government \nadopted  a  measure  ensuring  the  provision  of  a  100%  subsidy  for  interest  payments  on  loans \nobtained through the government\u2019s agrocredit project. This measure will benefit up to 5,000 firms \nin the sector, most of which are expected to be SMEs. In addition to this, government will exempt \nagriculture sector firms from paying amelioration fees and will write off any accumulated arrears \non  such  fees.  This  measure  is  expected  to  benefit  up  to  40,000  small-holder  farmers  and \ncontribute toward increasing domestic food production.  \n \n16. \nProvision of ample liquidity to all firms. The National Bank of Georgia has adopted a \nrange of countercyclical measures that will ensure the provision of liquidity to the real economy. \nImplementation of additional capital requirements planned for March 2020 were postponed and \ncommercial banks are now allowed to use capital conversion, countercyclical, and related buffers. \n\n \n\n38 Enterprise  Georgia  is an agency  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Development  responsible  for  business support, \n\nexport promotion and investment in Georgia sectors.

Furthermore, criteria for security or pledging \nof  repurchase  agreements  to  support  local  currency  liquidity  have  been  updated.  Altogether, \nthese  measures  are  expected  to  free  up  additional  resources  of  around  GEL1.6  billion  ($500 \nmillion). \n \nSocial Assistance Package (GEL1.035 billion or $329 million). The government has \n17. \ncommitted to reducing the negative effects of job and income loss, increasing its support to the \npoor and vulnerable.47 To this end, it has adopted a range of measures that attempt to preserve \njobs  and  support  the  livelihoods  of  people  who  lose  their  source  of  income  as  a  result  of  the \nCOVID-19 crisis.  \n \n18. \nEmployment  preservation  measures.  To  avoid  mass  layoffs  in the formal  sector,  the \ngovernment will exempt businesses from income tax charged over GEL750 ($238) of income for \nworkers  with  incomes  up  to  GEL1,500  ($477)  for  6  months,  provided  these  worker\u2019s  jobs  are \nretained.  Up  to  300,000  employees  are  estimated  to  be  covered  by  this  assistance  measure. \nWorkers who lose their jobs or who are put on unpaid leave will receive temporary unemployment \nassistance equivalent to GEL200 per month ($63.5) for up to six months. For informal workers, \n50% of whom are estimated to be women,48 and self-employed workers who lose their source of \nincome,  the  government  will  provide  access  to  a  one-time  benefit  of  GEL300.  An  estimated \n250,000  workers  are  expected  to  benefit  from  this  scheme.  The  State  Employment  Support \nAgency  in  the  Ministry  of  Internally  Displaced  People  from  the  Occupied  Territories,  Labour, \nHealth  and  Social  Affairs  (MOILHSA)  will  verify  eligibility,  avoiding  overlaps  with  the  other \nemergency programs. \n\n \n19. \nCash  transfers  to  vulnerable  groups.  The  government  has  adopted  a  wide  range  of \ntemporary  social  protection  cash  transfer  measures  to  alleviate  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  the \npoor and vulnerable, especially women and people living with disabilities. The Targeted Social \nAssistance (TSA) delivery system provides a solid basis to address the temporary shock, with a \nsocial registry (accounting for 30% of the total population) that can facilitate a rapid expansion. \nApplication  and  registration  procedures  have  been temporarily  simplified  to facilitate  access to \nthe TSA. The threshold has been temporarily expanded from 65,000 to 100,000 (proxy-means \ntest score), with 70,000 households (190,000 citizens) expected to be eligible for GEL600 ($191) \non average in the next 6 months. Households with three or more children under the age of 16, \nare entitled to a top-up benefit of GEL100 per household for 6 months. Household with persons \nwith  severe  disabilities  and  disabled  children  are  entitled  to  an  additional  GEL200  ($63.5)  for  \n6 months. In addition to the expansion of the TSA system, government will also provide a cash \ntransfer of GEL600 ($191) for adults living with acute disabilities and children living with any type \nof disability over 6 months. As many as 41,500 people are expected to benefit from this scheme. \nIn addition to cash transfers to the vulnerable and poor, government will also ensure that the basic \n\n \n\n46 The  Basel  III  countercyclical  capital  buffer  is  calculated  as  the  weighted  average  of  the  buffers  in  effect  in  the \n\njurisdictions to which banks have a credit exposure. \n\n47 A total of 381,548 jobs\u2014257,365 employees and 124,183 self-employed\u2014are at high risk of job loss because of the \nCOVID-19 crisis. In addition, 23% of the population, or 45% of the total work force, is in the informal sector and at \nhigh risk of loss of income. Most of the self-employed work in agriculture.

To this end, government will subsidize utility fees for three months \n(March, April, May) for electricity and gas, and water bills for households that consume less than \n200 kWh of electricity and 200 cubic meters of natural gas per month. \n \nEnsuring  food  security.  Georgia  is  a  net food  importer49 and  highly  import-dependent \n20. \nfor most food categories.50 This puts food security at risk through food export restrictions. Food \nprices had already risen before the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching 13.4% year on year in March \n2020  compared  with  6.1%  headline  inflation,  because  of  exchange  rate  depreciation. 51 The \naverage share of food consumption expenditure was 43% in 2018, which underlines the social \nimportance of food prices. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture (MEPA) has \nadopted  a  range  of  measures  to  ensure  food  security  and  spur  domestic  production.52 These \ninclude:  (i)  ensuring  prices  for  basic  foodstuffs;53 (ii)  providing  crop  loans;54 (iii)  increasing  the \nmaximum  government  contribution  to  finance  fixed  agricultural  assets  from  8%  to  11%;  \n(iv) subsidizing interest rates of up to 10% for food industry;55 (v) securing collateral of up to 50% \nfor livestock working capital loans; (vi) supporting smallholder milk production with GEL3 million \n($0.95  million); 56  (vii)  subsidizing  wheat \nimports  with  GEL5.2  million  ($1.65  million);  \n(viii)  expanding  the  Agriculture  Insurance  Program  by  GEL9  million  ($2.86  million);57 and  (ix) \nrenewing the Agricultural Support Program with GEL10 million ($3.18 million).58 The government \nwill focus on SMEs in the agriculture sector, relying on the registry of support schemes to identify \nbeneficiaries. In addition, MEPA, together with the European Union, and the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, awarded 50 matching grants for a total amount of GEL2.2 \nmillion ($0.7 million) to support food production and security.59 \n \n21. \nPro-poor  and  gender-responsive  response  program.  Georgia\u2019s  Anti-Crisis  Plan \neffectively addresses the needs of the poor and vulnerable including women, children and people \nliving with disabilities. By increasing health spending, the MOILHSA will help protect all frontline \nmedical workers from contagion, 62% of whom are women. By ensuring that all COVID-19 related \ndiagnosis  and treatment  are  provided free  of  charge,  the  government  is  also safeguarding the \npoorest from a potential increase in out-of-pocket expenditure on health. This is likely to benefit \nwomen-headed  households,  which  spent,  an  average  of  1%  more  on  health  care  than  men-\nheaded  households  in  2016.60 Under  its  private  sector  support  package,  the  government  will \nprotect all the 40% of Georgians living near the poverty line, who rely on labor income for their \n\n \n\n49 A.

Targeted  support  to  firms  in  the  tourism  industry  is \nparticularly important to safeguard the economic well-being of Georgian women, who constitute \n60% of hired workers in the sector. Support to SMEs is also of critical importance to safeguard \nprogress made in the economic empowerment of women in recent years. As of 2018, 67% of all \nwomen employed in the private sector worked for SMEs, and 33% of them are now owned or \nmanaged  by  women  (paragraph  14).61 The  government\u2019s  social  assistance  package  has  been \ntailored to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the poor and vulnerable. The \ntemporary unemployment subsidy put in place will help newly laid-off Georgians to sustain their \nlivelihoods  until  they  are  able  to  seek  employment  opportunities (paragraph  18).  This  will  help \nmitigate resurgence in poverty incidence as a result of frictional unemployment. The package also \nincludes increases in the coverage of the TSA, of which 55% of beneficiaries are women.  This \nwill  ensure  that  individuals  who  fall  into  poverty  because  of  COVID-19  are  provided  adequate \nfinancial support to meet their basic needs (paragraph 19). Finally, the government\u2019s Anti-Crisis \nPlan also includes measures to assist large families as well as people living with acute disabilities.  \n \n22. \nStructural Reforms. Georgia\u2019s response to COVID-19 follows a two-pronged approach: \nan initial temporary emergency relief package and the continuation of critical structural reforms to \nensure the adequacy of its social welfare and public health systems within a sustainable macro-\nfiscal framework. As an immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government established \nthe IACC under the direction of the Prime Minister in February 2020. The IACC has taken decisive \nand credible steps to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the recessionary impact on \nthe economy. The declaration of a national State of Emergency in March 2020 was followed by \nthe publication of an extensive list of containment measures and, in April 2020, the announcement \nof a comprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience, affected businesses, \nand the poor and vulnerable during the crisis. In the medium term, the government is committed \nto pursuing a comprehensive fiscal management and social protection reform program with ADB \nto strengthen inclusive economic growth in the long run within macroprudential limits. This forms \npart of the government\u2019s recovery program. In addition to these reforms, the government remains \ncommitted  to  (i)  structural  policy  reform  in  public  sector  management  to  ensure  the  fiscal \nsustainability of government operations in the medium term; (ii) capital market reforms to support \nthe de-dollarization of the financial sector and reduce external vulnerabilities; (iii) reforms to the \neducation system to improve job matching, productivity, and wages; (iv) operationalizing pension \nreforms;62 (v)  continuing  business  environment  reforms,  e.g.,  requiring  corporations  to  publish \naudited  financial  statements  based  on  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS);  \n(vi) developing land cadasters to help protect property rights and simplify land transactions; and \n(vii) reforms to benefit from Georgia\u2019s free trade agreements (FTAs).63  \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe proposed CARES Program will be a critical component of the government\u2019s efforts to \nmitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the health and welfare of Georgians. It is aligned \nwith the following overarching development objective of the Anti-Crisis Plan: health and economic \nimpacts of COVID-19 in Georgia are mitigated, protecting the most vulnerable. The program will \nhave the following effect: rate of spread of the disease managed, burden on affected businesses \nmitigated  and  poverty  contained.  The  program  is  structured  around  three  output  areas:  \n\nProposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n\n \n\n61 ADB staff calculations based on Geostat Gender.

ADB  has  been  a  trusted  partner  of  Georgia  in  emergency \n24. \nresponse,  public sector management  reform,  social  protection  and  infrastructure  development. \nThe  proposed  program  builds  on  more  than  a  decade  of  close  cooperation  across  key  policy \nreform areas such as fiscal management and social protection, which will be critical elements of \nthe  government\u2019s  post-pandemic  recovery  response.  Starting  in  2014,  ADB  has  been \ncontinuously engaged in policy dialogue with the government regarding fiscal management and \nsocial protection reform. 64 Under the Second Domestic Resource Mobilization Program,65 ADB is \nstrengthening  public  sector  management  and fiscal  responsibility  while  supporting  government \nefforts to reform its public pension system\u2014the largest social protection program in the country. \nTo this end, ADB is strengthening the capacity of key government institutions through a carefully \ndesigned  capacity  building  plan  under  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  Second  Domestic \nResource Mobilization Program. It is also processing a policy-based loan with a focus on reforms \nin fiscal management and social protection. Underpinning the CARES Program, ADB is providing \ngrant  support to procure medical supplies and equipment, capacity building for the COVID-19 \nhealth response and a platform to share and learn from the response of other countries in the \nregion, funded under the regional technical assistance project Regional Support to Address the \nOutbreak  of  Coronavirus  Disease.66 In  addition  to  the  strong  base  of  country  knowledge,  the \nCARES  Program  is  also  informed  by  lessons  learnt  through  previous  policy-based  program \nsupport provided to Georgia. Experience through this program provided useful lessons, especially \nthe importance of a clear but realistic DMF, with measurable targets and provision of adequate \nmonitoring support to the government. The Program has drafted the DMF in close coordination \nwith government and has also set up a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) team to ensure \ntight  feedback  loops  and  enhance  ADB\u2019s  capacity  to  support  the  government  in  overcoming \nemerging challenges throughout the implementation period.  \n \n25. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The Program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically the operational priorities on addressing poverty and reducing inequality (through its \nsupport  for  social  programs  that  will  mitigate  the  expected  increase  in  poverty  incidence), \naccelerating progress in gender equality (through its gender sensitive targets), and strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity (through support for strengthening the public health sector \nand  social  welfare  system),  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (through \ncomplementarities with the regional TA being provided to help inform health responses based on \nexperience from other countries in the region).67 \n \nC. \nSustainability \n\nDevelopment  Financing  Needs,  Development  Partner  Coordination  and  Debt \n\n26. \nDevelopment financing needs for 2020.

The proposed CARES Program provides for about 6.5% of gross \nfinancing requirements for 2020. The remaining gap will be addressed by loans and grants from \ndevelopment  partners  as  well  as  domestic  borrowing,  with  government  deposits  available  to \nweather  against  downside  risks,  if  necessary.  The  IMF,  World  Bank,  the  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank and selected bilateral partners have committed to assist Georgia in accessing \nfinance (Table 2). Total ADB budget support in 2020 will tentatively amount to $630 million, or \n41%  of  gross  financing  requirements.  This  support  will  help  finance  Georgia\u2019s  countercyclical \neconomic  response  efforts.  Given  the  rise  in  the  yield  spreads  to  US  Treasury  bonds  in \ninternational markets, Georgia aims to reduce its reliance on international capital markets to the \nextent  possible.  It  will  also  avoid  drawing  on  its  international  gross  reserves,  which  it  has \naccumulated over recent years and amount to $3.5 billion.  \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Need and Tentative Budget Support by Development Partners 2020  \n($ millions) \n\nItem \n\n2020 pre-\nCOVID-19 \n\nThematic Focus \n\n \n\n261 \n234 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGross financing requirement \n \nGross foreign financing \n \nADB \n \n  CARES Program (CPRO) \n \n  Fiscal Management and Social Protection PBL \n  Modern Skills for Better Jobs (SDP)d \n \n  Sustainable Water Sanitation Services (SDP)d \n \n  State Electro System Corporatization (SDP)d \n \nJoint DPO World Bank \nAIIB \nRural development, Education \nEuropean Union  \nSocial Protection \nFrance (AFD) \nEnergy policy \nGermany (KfW) \nExtended Fund Facility \nIMF \nHealth, Education, Emergency Response \nWorld Bank \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AIIB  =  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  CARES  =  COVID-19  Active  Response  and  Expenditure  Support,  CPRO  =  COVID-19  Pandemic \nResponse Option, DPO = development policy operation, EU = European Union, IMF = International Monetary Fund, \nKfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, PBL = policy-based loan, SDP = sector development program. \na Subject to revision. \nb Amount to be confirmed. \nc Subject to availability of resources and co-financing.  \nd Policy-based component only (budget support).  \nSource: Government of Georgia, Ministry of Finance. \n \n27. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac92,302,000 ($100,000,000 equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to provide countercyclical budgetary support for Anti-Crisis \nPlan. The loan will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 6.75 years \nand there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n28. \nDevelopment  Partner  Coordination.  The  government  is  actively  coordinating  health, \nsocial,  and  economic  responses  with  development  partners  to  overcome  the  pandemic  with \ndecisive  policy  measures.  Since  February  2020,  it  has  conducted  regular  IACC  meetings  on \nCOVID-19 related issues, chaired by the Prime Minister. The IACC is actively cooperating with \n\n2020 \nCOVID-19 \nadjusted \n1,533a \n1,150 \n280b \n100 \nTBDc \n50 \n50 \n80 \n100 \n95 \n205 \n100 \n200 \n180 \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fthe  WHO  on  preparedness  and  response  measures  to  keep  the  situation  under  control.  In \npreparing the proposed CARES Program, the ADB team has consulted and coordinated closely \nwith  the  IMF  on  Georgia\u2019s  macroeconomic  situation,  and  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment partners on potential financial  support packages aimed at mitigating the negative \nimpact caused by COVID-19. The thematic focus of each development partner\u2019s budget support \nprograms  is  described  in  Table  2.  The  proposed  program  provides  critical  support  to  the \ngovernment and complements other stakeholders\u2019 responses. As economic impact of COVID-19 \nbecomes clearer, ADB will consider providing further support to the government and explore co-\nfinancing opportunities. ADB has also begun liaising with relevant development partners involved \nin  social  protection  to  coordinate  future  assistance.  These  include  the  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement and the World Bank. ADB will also remain involved in fiscal management reform \nareas, working closely with the IMF to monitor the macroeconomic situation. \n \n29. \nCoordination with the IMF. In December 2019, the IMF and the government agreed to \nan extension of the Extended Fund Facility until April 2021 (footnote 14). The IMF will supervise \nthe compliance with performance criteria and structural benchmarks that help sustain medium-\nterm macroeconomic stability. ADB has consistently liaised with the IMF as part of its engagement \nin  public  financial  management  (PFM)  in  Georgia,  under  the  Second  Domestic  Resource \nMobilization  Program  and  associated  technical  assistance  project  (footnote  65).  Recently, \ncoordination with the IMF and other development partners has strengthened to converge around \na coordinated response to the COVID-19 crisis. The IMF welcomes ADB\u2019s financial support to \nGeorgia, which will help prevent the accumulation of more onerous financing. The assessment \nletter from the IMF68 and the debt sustainability assessment from ADB69 confirm that the proposed \nProgram would not worsen the country\u2019s debt sustainability situation. Coordination with the IMF \nand other development partners on the long-term implementation of macroeconomic and financial \nreforms  is  ensured  regionally  through  activities  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  program,  whose  economic  and  financial  stability  cluster  holds  regular  high-level \ndialogues on macroeconomic policy design and management.70  \n \n30. \nDebt  is  sustainable in the  medium  term.  Public  debt\u2013GDP  in  Georgia has  remained \nstable between 2014\u20132019, consistently below 45%. Although it is expected to rise sharply from \n42.7% of GDP in 2019 to 62.4% in 2020, ADB expects it to remain sustainable over the medium \nterm. The increase in 2020 is largely because of the fiscal stimulus package to mitigate the impact \nof  COVID-19  compounded  by  a  decline  of  23.3%  in  revenue  collection  against  the  original \nestimate for 2020. The resulting gross financing requirement will be closed primarily through loans \nand grants from development partners and domestic borrowing to accommodate a higher level of \nfiscal deficit to mitigate further downside risks to economic and social development. From 2021 \nonwards, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to decline as one-off spending measures wane \nand  economic  growth  recovers.  It  is  expected  to  reach  50.8%  of  GDP  by  2025.  Financial \nassistance  from  ADB  will  not  aggravate  Georgia\u2019s  debt  vulnerabilities  and  fiscal  risks  in  the \nmedium term. While providing critical countercyclical support to the economy, the proposed ADB \nbudget support loans in 2020 represent just 8.3% of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock of nearly $7.6 \nbillion. Additional loans approved or under proposal by other development partners would jointly \nadd another 11.6% to the public debt stock. Together, lending from all these institutions would lift \npublic debt initially to 72% of GDP in 2020, and to 58% of GDP by 2024. These loans, on broadly \nconcessional terms, will not add significantly to the government\u2019s annual debt service obligations. \n \n\n68 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n69 ADB debt sustainability analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n70 Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program.

The government \nand  ADB  have  agreed  on  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  to  support  effective \nimplementation  of  Georgia\u2019s  COVID-19  response  plan.  ADB  has  committed  to  establishing  a \nMonitoring, Evaluation and Learning Lab, which will work closely with MOF and other relevant \ngovernment  agencies  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  program,  and  support  with \nmonitoring and reporting to ADB. The MEL Lab will liaise with the IACC and optimize feedback \nloops  throughout  the  implementation  process  to  allow  for  timely  learning  and  adaptive \nmanagement  to  the  implementing  agencies.  ADB,  through  the  MOF  and  the  MEL  Lab,  has \ncommitted  to  mobilizing  TA  resources  to  help  the  government  respond  to  any  emerging \nchallenges in a flexible and agile manner. Ongoing TA project on fiscal management reforms will \nensure policy dialogue with government on the evolution of the macroeconomic situation (footnote \n69). ADB\u2019s regional TA support to the health sector will help contribute to capacity building and \nsharing of regional experiences and lessons (footnote 66). The MOF will monitor budget execution \nand  flow  of  funds  for  countercyclical  measures.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nThe program implementation period is June 2020 to June 2021.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nin  Georgia  with \n\nimproved  significantly \n\nGovernance.

According  to  the  most  recent  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial \nAccountability  Assessment  (2018)  Georgia  has  sound  systems  in  place  for  strategic  budget \nplanning, execution and accounting and reporting.71 Notable improvements in fiscal discipline are \nreflected  in  a  reduction  of  variance  of  expenditure  outturn  when  compared  with  the  budget \n(decreased use of virements) and robust execution rates for revenue and stronger oversight of \naggregate fiscal risk from state-owned enterprises and public-private partnerships. Georgia has \nimproved its strategic allocation of resources through its multi-year budgeting tool and preparation \nof costed sector strategies. Finally, Georgia has witnessed an increase in the efficiency of the use \nof resources for service delivery, with increased effectiveness of payroll controls; internal audit; \ntimelier and more regular reconciliation of accounts; and expansion of the scope and nature of \nfollow-up audits.  \n \n33. \nPoverty  and  Gender.  Despite  substantial  gains,  households  in  Georgia  remain  highly \nvulnerable  to  shocks,  including  those  associated  with  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19.  Georgia\u2019s \ncurrent  social  welfare  system  covers  a  relatively  high  share  of  the  population  but  may  not  be \nsufficient to address the needs of its poorest citizens. While 24% of Georgians are beneficiaries \nof at least one social assistance program\u2014with women constituting 64.9% of all recipients\u2014only \n11.7% of Georgians receive a subsistence allowance under the TSA, against 20.1% of people \nliving under the national poverty line. Nevertheless, the high share of women beneficiaries of both \nthe  TSA  (55%)  and the pension  fund  (71%)  suggest that  women  receive  wider  coverage  from \nsocial  welfare  programs  than  men.  As  of  2018,  the  share  of  women  living  under  the  relative \npoverty line in Georgia (20.5%) was only marginally lower than that of men (20.6%). Most of the \n61,000 women who received social benefits from government were aged 18\u201359 years (footnote \n12). Of the 61,000 women who received social benefits, 81% received disability pension, while \n18% received survivors\u2019 pension, and 1% received state compensation.

Adverse Impact of \nExogenous Shocks \n\nASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACCESS CRITERIA FOR THE COUNTERCYCLICAL SUPPORT FACILITY AND \nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC RESPONSE OPTION  \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nThe  first  confirmed  case  of  COVID-19  in  Georgia  was  reported  on  26  February,  imported  by  a  citizen \nreturning  from  Iran  via  Azerbaijan.  As  of  19  April  2020,  394  cases  had  been  reported  and  four  deaths \nconfirmed.  The doubling time of total confirmed COVID-19 cases stood at 8.76 days. a The relatively low \nnumber of confirmed cases, deaths and doubling time attests to the effectiveness of the strict containment \nmeasures adopted by the Government on 21 March 2020, as it declared state of emergency. The pandemic \nand  ensuing  containment  and  behavioral  responses  are  dampening  potential  GDP  growth  in  Georgia, \nlowering  tax  revenues,  and  putting  pressure  on  the  lari  (11.2%  depreciation  against  the  USD  between \nFebruary  and  April  2020).b  Lower  growth  in  trading  partners  is  expected  to  significantly  lower  exports  \n(-24%)  and  remittances  (-15%).  Heightened  global  uncertainty  will  hamper  confidence,  reduce  capital \ninflows (-19% growth in FDI), and delay investment. High headline inflation in 2019\u2014at 7% as a result of \nnominal depreciation\u2014is expected to decrease to 3.5% in 2020 because of lower commodity prices and \nsubdued domestic demand. c According to recent IMF and MOF estimates, reduction in economic activity \nis expected to bring growth to -4 percent in 2020, against the original estimate of 4% growth in 2020 and \nin sharp contrast with the 4.9% growth average in the period 2016\u20132019. c  \n \nGeorgia\u2019s external position in 2019 was favorable. The current account deficit narrowed to a record low \n(5.1 percent of GDP) driven by a favorable trade balance. The completion of significant FDI projects helped \ncontain imports and the NIIP. Gross international reserves reached $3.5 billion in 2019, boosted by the \nforeign exchange interventions by the National Bank of Georgia, larger-than-expected inflows, and lower-\nthan-expected government foreign exchange expenditures.  c The COVID-19 shock is expected to widen \nthe current account to 11.3% in 2020, exacerbating pressures on the NIIP and reserves, and weakening \nthe  external  position.  Continued  prudent  fiscal  policy,  exchange  rate  flexibility,  and  structural  reforms \nimplementation  remain  essential  to  safeguarding  external  sustainability  over  the  medium-term.  A \nprotracted crisis is limiting the fiscal space needed to mitigate health and economic impacts. A decline of \n23.3%  in  revenue  collection  against  the  original  estimate  for  2020,  led  by  a  reduction  of  1.6%  in  the  \ntax\u2013GDP  ratio,  will  widen  the  fiscal  deficit  to  8.1%  against  the  original  estimate  of  2.2%  of  GDP.d  The \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to meet  gross  financing  needs  is  further  constrained by  growing  uncertainty  in  the \nfinancial markets resulting in higher costs of borrowing.  \n \nEconomic  slowdown  in  2020  threatens  the  development  gains  Georgia  achieved  since  2012.  The \nunemployment  rate,  which  reached  a  record  low  in  2019  at  11.6%  in  2019,  could  triple  if  no  public \nintervention  is  adopted  to  avoid  mass  layoffs.e  Taking  into  account  the  measures  put  in  place  by  the \n\n \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\n2.

Pre-shock Record \nof sound \nmacroeconomic \nManagement \n\n \n\nAppendix 4       23 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \ngovernment  to  avoid  spikes  in  unemployment,  the  rate  of  unemployment  is  expected  to  rise  to  19%  in \n2020.  d  Such  sharp  increases  in  unemployment  could  eradicate  years  of  inclusive  economic  growth, \nreversing  a  decade-long  decline  in  absolute  poverty.    While  absolute  poverty  ($1.90/day)  has  declined \nsharply from 12.2% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2019, the effects of COVID-19 are expected to lead to a rise in \npoverty incidence to 4.3%, in a best-case scenario, or 6.8%, in a worst-case scenario.  Further, as of 2018, \n47%  of  Georgians  were  estimated  to  remain  vulnerable  to  poverty,  with  monthly  incomes  precariously \nclose to the poverty line, placing a significant share of the population at risk of poverty due to decline in \nincomes and a rise in unemployment.f \n \nThe government announced a GEL3.5 billion ($1.1 billion) Anti-Crisis Plan, to cover higher spending in the \nhealth  sector  amounting  to  GEL350  million  ($111  million),  provide  assistance  to  affected  private  sector \nentities worth GEL2,110 million  ($671 million), and support the unemployed, poor and vulnerable with a \nGEL1.035 billion ($329 million) social assistance package. The total expenditure package amounts to 7.4% \nof  GDP,  one  of  the  highest  in  the  region.  The  government  has  also  adopted  a  range  of  countercyclical \nmonetary policy measures for price stability and adequate liquidity in the financial system. Georgia\u2019s Anti-\nCrisis  Plan  effectively  addresses  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  including  women,  children  and \npeople living with disabilities across its three areas of focus: (i) health intervention; (ii) support to affected \nbusinesses; and (iii) support to social programs. It\u2019s support to the health system will help protect frontline \nmedical doctors, 62% of which are women, through the procurement of adequate PPEs. Under this Plan, \nthe  government  plans  to  ensure  that  health  services  related  to  COVID-19  are  provided  for  free, \nsafeguarding the poorest in society from increased health expenditure and out-of-pocket payments, and \nwill  ensure  that  it  provides  COVID-19  diagnosis  and  treatment  services  in  areas  with  high  density  of \nInternally Displaced Persons from the occupied territories.  \n \nUnder its private sector support package, the government will protect all the 40% of Georgians living near \nthe poverty line, who rely on labor income for their livelihoods, by containing mass layoffs. Targeted support \nto firms in the tourism industry is particularly important to safeguard the economic well-being of Georgian \nwomen, who constitute 60% of hired workers in the sector. Support to SMEs is also of critical importance \nto safeguard progress made in the economic empowerment of women in recent years. As of 2018, 67% of \nall women employed in the private sector worked for SMEs, and 33% of them are now owned or managed \nby women. g  \nAs noted by the IMF, \u201cthe COVID-19 outbreak has hit the Georgian economy hard [and] growth prospects \nfor 2020 have weakened sharply\u201d a as a result of it. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia\u2019s economy \nexpanded at an average of 4.7% between 2011\u20132019 and was expected to grow by 4.3% in 2020. Public \ndebt\u2013GDP, the fiscal deficit and total expenditure as a share of GDP were all expected to remain below \ntheir maximum ceilings, at 44.5%, 2.2% and 28.3% respectively. Reforms to tax administration led to a \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n24 \n \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n4. Structural reforms \nand pandemic \nresponse plan \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nhigher-than anticipated tax revenue collection, reaching 23.7% of GDP in 2019. g The only significant risk \nfaced by the authorities prior to COVID-19 stemmed from inflationary pressures, which the National Bank \nof Georgia targeted appropriately through tightened monetary policy. The banking sector\u2019s performance \nwas also expected to remain robust, with an increase in credit to the private sector, improved asset quality \nand higher liquidity despite marginally lower profitability. Previous assessment letters and Reviews under \nthe Extended Financing Agreement suggested gradual and continuous improvement of macroeconomic \nmanagement in Georgia. The IMF\u2019s favorable assessment letter confirm ADB staff\u2019s assessment that the \neconomic downturn is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not to previous macroeconomic mismanagement.  \n38.  Georgia\u2019s response to COVID-19 follows a two-pronged approach: an initial temporary emergency \nrelief package and the continuation of critical structural reforms to ensure the adequacy of its social welfare \nand public health systems within a sustainable macro-fiscal framework. As an immediate response to the \nCOVID-19  crisis,  the  government  established  the  IACC  under  the  direction  of  the  Prime  Minister  in \nFebruary 2020. The IACC has taken decisive and credible steps to contain the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate  the  recessionary  impact  on  the  economy.  The  declaration  of  a  national  state  of  emergency  in \nMarch  2020  was  followed  by  the  publication  of  an  extensive  list  of  containment  measures  and,  in  April \n2020, the announcement of a comprehensive response package supporting health sector resilience in the \nmedium-term. The health sector response revolves around five key areas of intervention:  \nCase detection and confirmation: The government will procure necessary medical hygiene materials, \nCOVID-19 test kits, laboratory reagents, polymerase chain reaction equipment, and specimen transport \nkits.  It  will  be  supported  by  investment  in  information  technology  systems  for  disease  surveillance  and \ncontract tracing. \nIsolation of high-risk individuals: The government will ensure that high risk individualsh are placed in \nspecially organized quarantine facilities. \nImproving the quality of medical care: To improve the quality of medical care provided and minimize \nrisks of infection to health personnel, the government will train at least 2,000 medical staff, procure essential \nmedical goods and carry out rapid conditioning of designated public health facilities.  \nPatient  care  and  case  management:  The  government  has  committed  to  providing  free  access  to  all \ndiagnostic, laboratory and treatment costs of COVID-19 patients in public and private facilities. \nInfrastructure  investment:  Government  is  investing  in  capacity  improvements  of  designated  public \nfacilities, including hospitals that serve a large internally displaced persons (IDP). \n \nIn addition to its medium-term health response plan, Georgia has made credible commitments to continue \npursuing structural reforms under International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility as well as planned \npolicy  reforms  supported  by  ADB.  These  reforms  include  (i)  structural  policy  reform  in  public  sector \nmanagement to ensure the fiscal sustainability of government operations in the medium term; (ii) capital \n\n\fAccess Criteria \n\n5. Debt sustainability \n\n6. Coordination the \nInternational Monetary \nFund \n\n \n\nAppendix 4       25 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nmarket reforms to support the de-dollarization of the financial sector and reduce external vulnerabilities; (iii) \nreforms  to  the  education  system  to  improve  job  matching,  productivity,  and  wages;  (iv)  operationalizing \npension  reforms;  (v)  continuing  business  environment  reforms,  e.g.,  requiring  corporations  to  publish \naudited financial statements based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); (vi) developing \nland cadasters to help protect property rights and simplify land transactions; and (vii) reforms to benefit \nfrom Georgia\u2019s free trade agreements (FTAs). \nPublic debt\u2013GDP ratio has been stable in recent years, hovering below 45% of GDP. Despite an expected \nsubstantial increase in 2020, led by temporary spending financed by development partners and domestic \nborrowing, ADB assessment concludes public debt remains stable in all standardized stress tests and is \nexpected to remain sustainable over the medium-term.d The CARES Program will have a minimal impact \non Georgia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio and will amount to 1.03% of public debt in 2020. With the CARES Program, \npublic debt\u2013GDP ratio will increase from 61.6% to 62.4% of GDP. Financial assistance from the ADB will \nnot  aggravate  Georgia\u2019s  debt  vulnerabilities and fiscal  risks  in the medium  term.  While providing critical \ncountercyclical support to the economy, the proposed ADB loans in the amount of $100 million represent \njust 1.3% percent of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock of nearly $7.6 billion. The planned total amount of ADB \nbudget support for 2020, in the amount of $630 million, represents just 8.3% of Georgia\u2019s public debt stock. \nThese  loans  will  not  add  significantly  to  the  annual  debt  service  obligations  facing  the  Government. \nAdditional loans approved or under proposal by the World Bank ($180 million), the International Monetary \nFund ($200 million), the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($205 million), the KfW ($100 million), the \nEuropean  Union  ($95 million),  and the  Asian Infrastructure Investment  Bank ($100  million)  would jointly \nadd another 11.6% to the public debt stock. Together, lending from all these institutions would lift public \ndebt initially to 72% of GDP in 2020, and to 58% of GDP by 2024. \nADB has consulted with IMF and is in close contact with its relevant staff on macroeconomic monitoring. \nIMF has a favorable assessment letter (linked documents 9). In the Assessment Letter, the IMF share ADB \nstaff\u2019s assessment that the government\u2019s fiscal response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \non the economy is appropriate. The IMF considers that despite a spite a sharp increase in the public debt\u2013\nGDP  ratio  in  2020, medium-term fiscal  consolidation  will  bring  public  debt (net  of  government  deposits) \nbelow  45%  of  GDP  by  2024  and  is  sustainable  in  the  medium-term.  The  IMF  has  reached  staff-level \nagreement on an augmentation of access of 130% of quota under the Extended Fund Facility, helping the \ngovernment meet shock-related needs, and build buffers. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; CARES = COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; FTA = free trade agreement; \nGDP = gross domestic product; IACC = Inter Agency Coordination Council; IDP = internally displaced person; IFRS = International Financial Reporting Standards; IMF \n= International Monetary Fund; KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; MOF = Ministry of Finance; NIIP = net international investment position; PPE = personal protective \nequipment; SME = small and medium-sized enterprise. \na Information retried from StopCov.ge on 20 April 2020. \nb National Bank of Georgia.
