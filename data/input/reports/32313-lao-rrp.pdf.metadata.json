Following the primary health care expansion \nproject,  it  will  help  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  to  improve \nprimary  health  care  (PHC)  delivery  in  the  eight  northern \nprovinces;  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  MOH  in  planning, \nbudgeting, financing, human resource development (HRD), and \ncoordination towards a comprehensive program approach.  \n \nStarting from a low base, the country\u2019s health indicators still lag \nbehind those of most other countries in the region. Challenges \ninclude  widespread  poverty,  isolated  populations,  and  public \nsector  capacity  and  financing  constraints.  A  PHC  network  has \nbeen put in place in the last decade, and access to basic health \ncare has substantially improved. However, the health behavior \nof the rural poor has not changed much, and demand for health \nservices  remains  low.  Services  are  often  substandard  and  not \naffordable  to  the  poor.  Appropriate  services  for  women  and \nsome ethnic groups are often lacking.  \n \nThe Government of the Lao PDR stands committed to reducing \npoverty and achieving the MDGs, and has identified the health \nsector as one of four priority sectors in the NSEDP6. The MOH \nhas  prepared  the  Health  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  to \naddress  the  sector  challenges,  including  moving  toward  a \ndecentralized  and  results-based  approach,  integrating  PHC, \nimproving  maternal  and  child  health  and  nutrition,  developing \nhuman  resources,  improving  health  sector  financing,  and \nharmonizing external assistance.   \n \nThe  proposed  Project  is  included  in  the  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram Update (2006\u20132008) for the Lao PDR approved by the \nBoard in August 2005, and is also included in the 2007 country \nprogram. It builds on ADB\u2019s previous investments in the health \nsector  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  responds  to  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts  to  improve  PHC  delivery  and  help  prepare  the  building \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nGrant Allocation Terms \n\nblocks for a national program. It proposes internationally proven \nstrategies  for  improving  PHC  performance,  and  cost-effective \ninterventions  that  benefit  the  poor,  women,  and  ethnic  groups \nmost.  \n\nThe goal of the Project is to improve health and nutrition in the \nLao  PDR,  particularly  among  the  poor,  women  and  children, \nand ethnic groups in the eight northern provinces. Its aim is to \nimprove  health  and  nutrition  behavior,  increase  use  of  health \nservices, and make the provincial health system more effective, \nefficient, and equitable in delivering PHC.  \n \nThe objectives of the Project are (i) to improve PHC delivery in \nthe eight northern provinces, particularly for vulnerable groups; \nand  (ii) \nfor  health  system \ndevelopment  nationwide,  including  planning  and  budgeting, \ntwo \nfinancing,  HRD,  and  coordination.  The  Project  has \ncorresponding components and is based on a two-phased PHC \ndevelopment concept covering 8 years.  \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $15.0 million equivalent for the \n4-year period, including taxes, duties, and contingencies. \n\nto  strengthen  MOH  capacity \n\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$13.0 million from its Special Funds resources to cover 87% of \nthe project cost. The Government will contribute $2.0 million.  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\n \nSource \nAsian Development Banka \nGovernment \n \na Asian Development Fund grant. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n  Amount\n13.0 \n2.0 \n15.0 \n\n \n \n\nADB will provide a grant of $13.0 million from its Special Funds \nresources  with \nin \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Grant  Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\nterms  and  conditions  substantially \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nThe grant will be used until 31 March 2012.  \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n30 September 2011.  \n \n\nThe executing agency will be the MOH, through its Department \nof  Planning  and  Budgeting  (DPB).  Project  implementation  will \nbe  mainstreamed  through  the  various  MOH  departments,  with \nthe DPB in a coordinating and administrative role.  \n \nThe MOH Steering Committee chaired by the Minister of Health \nwill guide project implementation. Departments of the MOH and \n\nImplementation \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nthe  biodata \n\ncore  ministries  are  represented  in  the  committee.  Project \nreview  meetings  will  be  held  every  quarter.  MOH  has  also \nformed technical task forces for guiding implementation.   \n \nto  ADB\u2019s \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  conform \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nThe Project will require five international consultants for a total \nof 47 person-months, five national consultants for a total of 90 \nperson-months,  and  architect  and  accounting  services.  The \ninternational  experts  in  PHC  systems  (21 person-months), \nhealth  policy  and  planning  (6  person-months)  and  health \neconomics  (8  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  hiring \nconsultants. The architect and accounting services will be hired \nthrough separate firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), \nusing \ntechnical  proposal  and  consultant \nqualification  selection  or  least-cost  selection  method.  Other \nconsultants  will  be  contracted  through  one  firm  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the \nfixed  budget  selection  method  and  biodata  technical  proposal. \nThis package includes international experts in HRD (9 person-\nmonths)  and  social  development  (3  person-months);  and \nnational  experts  in  health  information  (24  person-months), \nhealth  policy  and  planning  (12  person-months),  HRD  (24 \nperson-months), health care financing (24 person-months), and \nsocial development (6 person-months). \n \nThe  Project  is  targeted at  the  rural poor,  women  and  children, \nand  ethnic  groups.  The  country  is  lagging  behind  its  MDGs \nbecause  of  high  mortality  and  morbidity  among  these  groups. \nHighly cost-effective interventions through an established PHC \nsystem will help the Lao PDR in achieving its MDGs. At project \ncompletion,  health  behavior,  coverage  of  essential  services, \nand health system performance will have improved. Substantial \ncapacity will have been built up at MOH and the provinces for \nresults-based  planning,  budgeting, \nfinancing,  HRD,  and \nadministration towards a comprehensive program approach.   \n\nFour  risks  have  been  identified.  First,  MOH  and  provincial \ngovernments  must  make  difficult  political  choices  to  improve \nsector  performance.  Project  support  will  therefore  be  results-\nbased and participatory. Second, PHC delivery will depend on \nexternal  bridging  of  recurrent  costs  until  domestic  funding \nimproves.  Third,  staff  lack  skills  and  work  limited  hours  due  to \nlow  pay.  Fourth,  initial  project  delay  will  be  mitigated  by  using \nthe existing administrative capacity of the MOH. \n\n \n\nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f102  00'Eo\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nLAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nHEALTH SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nPEOPLE'S\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA\n\nGnot-Ou\n\nBoun Nua\n\nPhongsali\n\nPHONGSALI\n\nSamphan\n\nMai\n\nSing\n\nBoun Tai\n\nLouang-Namtha\n\nLong\n\nLOUANGNAMTHA\n\nNamo\n\nKhoa\n\nLa\n\nViangphoukha\n\nXai\n\nNambak\n\nNgoy\n\nNale\n\nOUDOMXAI\n\nViangkham\n\nM Y A N M A R\nM ekong River\n\nMeung\nBOKEO\n\nTonpheung\n\nXiangkho\n\nSopbao\n\nXam-Nua\n\nHouayxay\n\nBeng\n\nPha-Oudom\n\nLOUANGPHRABANG\n\nNga\n\nHouamuang\n\n20  00'No\n\nHoun\n\nChomphet\n\nPak-Ou\n\nPakxeng\n\nPhonxai\n\nEt\n\nViangxai\n\nHOUAPHAN\n\nXam-Tai\n\nPaktha\n\nPakbeng\n\nXianghon\n\nKhop\n\nNgeun\n\nHongsa\n\nPhoukhoun\n\nXaignabouri\n\nNan\n\nPhiang\n\nKasi\n\nXAIGNABOURI\n\nMet\n\nFuang\n\nVangviang\n\nKeo-Oudom\nHinheup\n\nThongmixai\n\nPhonhong\n\nLouangphrabang\n\nXiang-Ngeun\n\nKham\n\nPhoukout\n\nPhaxai\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nXaisomboun\n\nPek\n\nNonghet\n\nKhoun\nMok-Mai \nXIANGKHOUANG\n\nThathom\n\nVIET  NAM\n\nLongxan\n\nBorikhan\n\nThaphabat\n\nThourakhom\n\nPakxan\n\nBORIKHAMXAI\nViangthong\n\nPakkading\n\nKhamkeut\n\nPaklai\n\nSangthong\n\nNaxaythong\nXaithani\n\nSikhottabong\n\nVIENTIANE\nMUNICIPAL\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nPak-Ngum\n\nChanthabouri\nHatxaifong\n\nSisattanak\n\nXanakham\n\nBoten\n\nKenthao\n\n20  00'No\n\nGulf   of   Tonkin\n\nTHAILAND\n\nHinboun\n\nNakay\nKHAMMOUAN\n\nGnommalat\n\nM\n\ne\n\nk\n\no\n\nn\n\ng Riv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nThakhek\n\nNongbok\n\nMahaxai\n\nBoualapha\n\nXebangfai\n\nXaibouathong\n\nAtsaphon\n\nVilabouri\n\nXaibouri\n\nOuthoumphon\n\nAtsaphangthong\n\nXepon\n\nPhalanxai\n\nKhanthabouri\n\nChamphon\n\nXonbouri\n\nSAVANNAKHET\n\nPhin\n\nNong\n\nXaiphouthong\n\nSongkhon\n\nSamouay\n\nProject Area - Component 1\n\nXanasomboun\n\nLaongam\n\nLaman\n\nDakchung\n\n16  00'No\n\nN\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nProvincial Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nNational Road\n\nPaved Provincial Road\n\nRiver\n\nDistrict Boundary\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n102  00'Eo\n\nThapangthong\n\nTa-Oy\nToumlan\n\n16  00'No\n\nLakhonpheng\n\nVapi\n\nSaravan\n\nKhongxedon\n\nSARAVAN\n\nKarum\n\nXEKONG\n\nThateng\n\nBachiangchareunsouk\n\nPhonthong\n\nChampasak\n\nSoukhouma\n\nPakxe\n\nPakxong\n\nPathoumphon\n\nSanxai\n\nXaisettha\nSamakkhixai\n\nCHAMPASAK\n\nSanamxai\n\nATTAPU\nPhouvong\n\nMounlapamok\n\nKhong\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n106  00'Eo\n\n06-3412 RM\n\n\f \n\n  I. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Health System Development Project \nto  support  primary  health  care  in  northern  Lao  PDR  and  build  capacity  for  health  system \ndevelopment nationwide. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe Lao PDR has a population of 5.6 million people, 73% of whom live in rural areas.1 \n2. \nAbout 2 million live in the eight, partly mountainous, northern provinces. The population is highly \ndispersed, with an average population density of 24 people per square kilometer and an annual \npopulation growth rate of 2%, including migration. The rural population is scattered over 10,552 \nvillages in 17 provinces and 141 districts. About 80% of the population depends on agriculture, \nbut only 4% of the land area is considered arable and permanent cropland.2 Small ethnic groups \nmake  up  about  30%  of  the  population;  most  of  these  are  poor,  live  in  the  uplands,  and  have \nlimited access to services and markets, particularly during the rainy season.  \n \n3. \nWith  the  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  the  sixth  national  socio-economic \ndevelopment plan (NSEDP6) for 2006\u20132010 gives high priority to reducing urban-rural inequity.3 \nAverage per capita income in the country increased from $335 in 2000 to $491 in 2005, and the \nannual  gross  domestic  product  grew  from  5.8%  in  2000  to  6.5%  in  2004. 4 Overall  income \npoverty declined from 46% in 1992 to 32% in 2003,5 but growth has been primarily urban, and \nrural-urban disparities are increasing. Poverty in the uplands is estimated at 43.9%, compared \nwith  28.2%  in  lowland  areas.  On  the  2005  gender-related  development  index,6 the  Lao PDR \nranked 102nd out of 140 countries; Viet Nam ranked 83rd, and Thailand, 57th.7 \n \n4. \nThe Lao PDR has made good progress in health indicators, but the country started from \na low base, and with current trends, will not achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs) \nfor the health sector. Child mortality reduced from 107 to 98 per 1,000 live births from 2000 to \n2005,  compared  with  the  MDG  of  55  per  1,000  by  2015.  The  maternal  mortality  ratio  (MMR) \nreduced from 530 to 405 per 100,000 live births from 2000 to 2005, compared with the MDG of \n185 per 100,000 live births in 2015 (footnote 1). Surrounded by five countries with higher HIV \nprevalence,  the  country  is  unlikely  to  halt  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS.  HIV  prevalence  has \nincreased to 1% of service women and 0.1% of adults aged 15-45 years.8 The health indicators \nshow major differences between socioeconomic groups (Appendix 1). \n\n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2005.

Malaria, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections \nare  the  common  causes  of  child  mortality,  often  in  association  with  malnutrition.  Besides  a \ngrowing HIV/AIDS epidemic, the population also faces the threat of an avian influenza epidemic. \nNoncommunicable  diseases  and  road  accidents  are  gaining  in  importance  as  well and  putting \npressure on the limited resources for health services.  \n \n6. \nThe  total  fertility  rate  has  reduced  to  4.5  children  per  woman,  while  the  contraceptive \nprevalence rate among married women has increased from 32% to 38% in 5 years. However, \nmotherhood has not become much safer. According to the Lao Reproductive Health Survey of \n2000,  only  23%  of  deliveries  were  attended  by  trained  health  personnel.9 Nationwide,  86%  of \ndeliveries  occurred  at  home,  and  9  out  of  10  maternal  deaths  occur  at  home.  Access  to \nemergency  obstetric  care  is  a  major  problem  in  rural  areas;  where  such  care  is  provided,  the \nprohibitive  costs  of  transport  and  operations  often  make  them  unaffordable.10 The  survey  also \nreported a high rate of pregnancies among teenagers (those aged 15\u201319), who are particularly \nat risk of complications during childbirth\u201418.4% of girls in this age group were either mothers or \npregnant at the time of the survey.  \n \n7. \nAccording to a 2006 study of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, 39% of children under \n5  years  of  age  are  underweight  (based  on  weight  for  age),  compared  with  40%  in  1990. \nMalnutrition  is  common  because  of  seasonal  food  shortages,  common  infections,  certain \ncustoms,  and  inappropriate  child care.  Micronutrient  deficiencies  in  vitamin  A,  iron,  and  iodine \nare  also  widespread. 11  Malnutrition  is  possibly  associated  with  as  much  as  58%  of  child \nmortality. It is now receiving more attention as a major public health problem.  \n \n8. \nUnder  the  stewardship  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  primary  health  care  (PHC)  is \ndelivered  through  a  system  that  includes  village  health  activities,  outreach  services,  health \ncenters,  district  and  provincial  health  offices  (PHOs)  and  hospitals,  and  centrally  managed \nvertical programs. A substantial network of health centers has been established.12 In 2004, 53% \nof villagers in the eight northern provinces lived within 1 hour walking from a hospital or health \ncenter and 16% were more than 4 hours away. Physical access is becoming less of a barrier to \nhealth  services  for  most  people.  However,  physical  and  social  access  is  still  poor  for  women \nneeding reproductive health care and for remote ethnic communities in general. Overall demand \nfor services remains low. Of those seeking treatment, 26% use a village health volunteer (VHV) \nor  village  health  provider;  40%  a  government  facility;  and  29%  a  private  pharmacy  or  clinic \n(section  B). 13  Family  care  including  child  nutrition  can  also  be  improved,  even  given  local \nconditions.   \n \n9. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to  address  this  situation.  Its  overall \nstrategic  framework  identifies  health  as  a  priority  sector  for  development,  and  proposes  to \nreduce differences between urban and rural health, lower mother and child mortality rates, raise \nlife  expectancy,  and  contain  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases.  In  health  and  human \nresource  development  (HRD),  priority  is  given  to  deploying  more  health  personnel  to  the \ndistricts  and  villages,  particularly  to  remote  rural  areas,  upgrading  the  quality  and  capacity  of \nhealth personnel, and improving health financing. \n                                                 \n9  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2000.

Vientiane. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nIn addition to expanding the infrastructure network, the MOH has set up a village health  \n10. \nprogram to improve health and nutrition behavior and provide villages beyond 2 hours walking \nfrom  a  health  facility  with  better  access  to  health  care  (footnote  12).    Through  village  health \ncommittees, local men and women have been trained as VHVs. They provide basic treatment of \ncommon  diseases  with  medicines  financed  from  a  drug  revolving  fund  (DRF).  In  five  northern \nprovinces surveyed under the Primary Health Care Expansion Project (PHCEP), by 2004, drug \nkits had been supplied to 48% of the villages compared to 10% 4 years earlier. These drug kits \nare  now  the  primary  source  of  medicines  in  these  villages.  More  recently,  VHVs  and  union \nmembers  have  also  been  introduced  to  peer  education  to  augment  behavioral  change  efforts. \nThe  program  can  be  improved  and  expanded  to  include  more  prevention  and  promotion \nactivities, in particular for reproductive health and nutrition.    \n \nThe NSEDP6 identifies health as one of four priority sectors for development. It calls for \n11. \nexpanded  PHC  services  to  all  remote  and  poor  villages,  and  more  village  and  district  health \npersonnel. The plan is being implemented in the context of greater decentralization of authority \nto  the  provinces.  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Instruction  01  of  March  2000  outlines  the  Government\u2019s \ndecentralization approach, with the province as the strategic unit for development, the district as \nthe planning and budgeting unit, and the village as the implementing unit. The decentralization \ninstruction  has  encouraged  the  MOH  to  concentrate  on  results-based  approaches  to  health \nmanagement.  \n \nThe  PHC  Policy  (2000)  approach  directly  addresses  the  MDGs.14 The  policy\u2019s  corner \n12. \nstones are (i) expanded coverage of the health service network to peripheral areas, (ii) health \ncare for women of reproductive age and children under 5 years, (iii) full community participation, \n(iv) dissemination  of  health  information  to  people  in  rural  areas,  (v)  use  of  resources  with  a \nsound scientific basis and appropriate to the actual situation and needs, (vi) collaboration with \nother  government  sectors  and  with  the  private  sector,  (vii)  more  support  for  a  more  effective \nPHC program, and (viii) sustainability of health care services at every level through community \ncontributions to and ownership of the services. The family, school, and pagoda will be the focal \npoints for PHC implementation in the villages. \n \nThe  MOH  has  prepared  the  Health  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010),15 and  is  preparing \n13. \npolicies, plans, and decrees for HRD, nutrition, the package of health services, and integration \nand decentralization of health services. The Plan emphasizes efforts to increase the number of \nfemales  and  members  of  small  ethnic  groups  among  health  workers.  The  expansion  and \nimprovement  of  the  PHC  network  has  obvious  financial  implications  for  the  Government.  The \nNSEDP6 lays out the Government\u2019s overall strategy for increasing and providing more efficient \nfunding of the health sector, along with improving donor coordination. Another health financing \npriority  under  the  plan  is  making  health  services  more  affordable  to  the  poor  by  introducing \nhealth  insurance  and  health  equity  funds  (HEFs).  The  Government  has  also  approved  the \nCurative  Law  (now  called  Health  Care  Law),  which  is  expected  to  improve  financing  of  health \nservices and includes adjustments in cost recovery that are likely to have impact on the poor.  \n    \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 1999.

Vientiane.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nReaching Vulnerable Groups to Achieve Millennium Development Goals \n\nThe poor use health services less than those in higher-income groups.16 In rural areas, \n14. \nhouseholds  in  the  highest  income  quintile  have  an  inpatient  admission  rate  of  42.4  per  1,000 \npersons per year, compared with 15.9 per 1,000 per year for households in the lowest quintile. \nWhile physical access has improved substantially in the past decade, half the population lives at \nleast  one  hour  walk  from  a  health  center  or  a  hospital.  Low  population  density  and  fiscal  and \nhuman  resource  constraints  limit  the  potential  for  improving  access  to  health  facilities,  and \nvillage-based health care has been introduced to complement these services.    \n \nServices  for  women  and  infants  are  less  accessible  and  often  not  up  to  standard  in \n15. \nhealth  centers  and  hospitals.  This  partly  explains  why  there  is  less  progress  in  reducing  the \nMMR, infant mortality rate, and low-birth-weight rate. Unless rural women and ethnic groups are \nreached with reproductive health services, these targets will remain elusive. However, a major \nreduction of the MMR is achievable with basic interventions, such as teenage education, family \nplanning in the villages, timely referral of reproductive complications, and surgical services. The \nissue of low affordability of care is discussed in section B6.    \n \n16. \nAdditional social barriers exist for isolated ethnic groups. Ethnic groups in the Lao PDR \nare  classified  into  four  linguistic  groups:  Tai-Kadai  (44%),  Mon-Kmer  (33%),  Hmong-Mien \n(16%), and Sino-Tibetan (7%). Many of these groups live in rural areas (90%), are subsistence \nfarmers (83%), and are poor (46%). They use services less and are less educated about health \nmatters, such as HIV prevention.17 They generally prefer to consult health staff who speak their \nlanguage  and  understand  their  views.  There  is  a  paucity  of  health  professionals  from  ethnic \ngroups  largely  because  of  comparatively  lower  educational  attainment.  A  PHCEP  pilot  study \ndemonstrated that local students can be trained as PHC workers to serve in their own villages. \n \n17. \nIf the MDG to reduce child mortality by two thirds is to stay on track, common infectious \ndiseases  affecting  the  rural  poor,  in  particular  ethnic  groups,  need  to  be  addressed.  These \ndiseases  can  be  prevented  with  simple,  highly  cost-effective \ninterventions  such  as \ninsecticide-treated  bednets,  better  personal  hygiene,  vaccination,  clean  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and timely recognition and basic treatment of common illnesses. However, progress \nhas been unstable because of management and service delivery problems, as discussed below.  \n \n18. \n Malnutrition, a major contributor to child mortality, will also need to be addressed. When \nthere are no food shortages, it is foremost a child care problem that primarily needs household \nand  community  interventions  rather  than  health  services.  The  Government  is  preparing  a \nnutrition  policy  and  plan  to  integrate  nutrition  into  PHC.  Nutrition  among  women  and  children \ncan be improved through specific, low-cost interventions such as the promotion of breastfeeding \nand a proper weaning diet, kitchen gardens, vitamin supplementation, and family planning.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n16 Lao PDR Public Expenditure Review, 2006 (draft). \n17 ADB.  2004.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f2. \n\nSetting Health Sector Priorities \n\n19. \nTo achieve the international goal of Health for All, the MOH gives priority to developing a \npublic welfare system based on the principles of PHC. In view of the Government\u2019s financial and \ncapacity  constraints,  this  translates  into  providing  a  basic  health  care  package  for  all  citizens \nwith  special  effort  to  reach  the  poor  and  near  poor.  The  Government  gives  high  priority  to \nimproving healthcare for rural women and ethnic groups, and is striving to expand services to all \nvillages and houses. Overall, making the health system more effective, equitable, and efficient \nentails a shift to promoting health and nutrition, preventing diseases, improving service quality \nand affordability, and reaching remote villages, in particular women and ethnic groups with high \nresidual  mortality.  Doing  so  requires  a  shift  in  the  mindset  and  practices  of  planners  and \nmanagers, more and more balanced financing, better staffing, and better communication.  \n \n20. \nThe  Government  has  taken  several  policy  actions  to  strengthen  the  delivery  of  health \nservices.  It  has  approved  a  reproductive  health  policy  that  includes  maternal  care  and  family \nplanning  in  villages,  and  training  of  midwives  and  surgeons.  Available  and  affordable \nemergency obstetric surgery in hospitals can potentially cut the MMR by about half and greatly \nreduce  chronic  complications  due  to  childbirth.  Considering  the  constraints  of  rural  hospitals, \nseveral innovative approaches will have to be taken, including the training of medical doctors in \nbasic surgery, and the provision of incentives to staff posted to rural hospitals where there is no \nother means of income. The Government passed a regulation to introduce financial incentives \nfor rural civil servants (Decree No. 381/PM), but these incentives do not appear to be enough. \nAs HIV/AIDS will continue to spread, the Government and the Joint United Nations Programme \non HIV/AIDS have prepared a plan to widen prevention efforts to reach all high-risk groups.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPHC Organization and Management Capacity \n\n21. \nA  major  problem  hampering  the  integration  of  PHC  is  the  vertical  management  of \ndisease  control  through  central  programs,  leading  to  fragmentation  and  inefficiency  at  lower \nlevels of implementation. Rather than pooling their resources and activities in the districts and \nvillages, health service providers are obliged to implement vertical program activities separately. \nMuch of this behavior is reinforced by donors who fund specific projects or programs and restrict \nthe  use  of  funds,  equipment,  medicines,  and  other  supplies.  For  example,  the  maternal  and \nchild  health  and  immunization  programs,  both  vertical  programs,  have  done  poorly  for  many \nyears, with limited management capacity, fragmented and unstable assistance, and, for the safe \nmotherhood program, an inability to scale up. Their integration in PHC has been slow.    \n \n22.  With  the  ongoing  decentralization,  the  roles  of  provincial  and  district  governments  are \nless  clear.  There  is  a  mismatch  between  the  responsibilities  of  provincial  and  district  health \nmanagers and their resources. Limited local stewardship and involvement in sector performance \nfurther  impede  the  ability  of  health  managers  to  respond  to  public  demand.  Because  of  the \nimplications and risks involved, competent provincial health managers are often reluctant to take \ninitiatives to improve services. \n  \nDistrict  managers,  to  varying  degrees,  lack  capacity  in  such  areas  as  planning  and \n23. \nbudgeting,  financial  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Managers  are  often  doctors \nor medical assistants without appropriate management training. A new generation of energetic- \nmanagers  is  emerging  in  the  districts,  but  most  have  received  only  short-term  management \ntraining.  Almost  all  provincial  health  officers  now  have  a  master\u2019s  degree  in  public  health, \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncompared with only about half in 1999.18 But only a few MOH officers have nonmedical training \nin such areas as health economics, administration, and HRD.  \n \n24. \nThe  current  organizational  structure  and  limited  management  capacity  in  the  health \nsystem  have  serious  implications.  National  health  policies  and  regulations  are  often  not  fully \nimplemented  by  local  governments.  Facility-based  and  outreach  services  are  fragmented, \nirregular, and of poor quality, resulting in a loss of public confidence. Also given the uncertain \nbenefit of using public services, associated costs of services are often unacceptable. The MOH \nplans to move toward provincial results-based programs to integrate programs and services and \nimprove  ownership,  accountability,  and  flexibility.  But  management  training,  advocacy  among \nstakeholders,  pilot-testing,  and  supporting  administrative  and  fund  flow  arrangements  will  be \nneeded to achieve this goal.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImproving Staff Performance \n\n25. \nThe  NSEDP6  and  the  PHC  policy  draw  attention  to  the  issue  of  health  service  quality. \nThe  performance  of  health  facilities  is  affected  by  inappropriate  staffing  or  understaffing.  The \nhigh  ratio  of  doctors  to  other  medical  staff  in  health  facilities  leads  to  health  system \ninefficiencies. There is one doctor for every 1.7 mid-level staff instead of the stated MOH goal of \nthree to four nurses per doctor, and one to two nurses per medical assistant. At the same time, \nhowever, surveys show that one third of the district hospitals are without a doctor (footnote 13).  \n \n26. \nPHC services are also affected by the type of training that health professionals receive. \nThe  past  emphasis  on  training  sufficient  numbers  of  health  staff  has  had  implications  for  the \nquality of the staff. Despite their participation in several in-service training programs, providers \nof  maternal  and  child  health  services  were  found  to  have  inadequate  knowledge,  skills,  and \nattitude to provide accurate information and appropriate services to clients.19 For lack of funds \nand opportunities for clinical and laboratory training, many medical professionals did not receive \nadequate skills beyond classroom theory before they were sent to work in health facilities. With \nthe  increase  in  enrollment  of  self-financed  students,  the  quality  of  training  has  deteriorated \nfurther. Also, some staff are in positions for which they have not received pre-service training, \nsuch as nurses working as laboratory technicians.  \n \n27. \nStaff management functions, such as providing regular feedback to staff, ensuring even \ndistribution  of  workload,  promoting  quality,  and  encouraging  participation,  also  need \nimprovement. Health center staff, lacking transport and an operational budget, only make a few \nsupervisory  visits  to  VHVs  each  year.  The  problem  of  limited  supervision  at  lower  levels  is \ncompounded  by  a  lack  of  accountability.  The  lack  of  equipment,  funds,  and  information  also \naffect staff motivation and the quality of services. \n \n\nImproving Recurrent Cost Financing  \n\n5. \n \n28. \nThe  serious  underfunding  of  the  health  sector  contributes  directly  to  low  performance \nand  presents  a  serious  challenge  to  the  Government,  given  the  fiscal  constraints  and  poverty \nlevels. Within these resource constraints, however, there is substantial scope for improvement. \nMuch  of  the  emphasis  in  the  past  few  years  has  been  on  investments  in  new  health  facilities \nwith the laudable purpose of improving access to health services of a higher standard. But this \n\n                                                 \n18 Bonnet,  Frederic.  1999.

Vientiane.    \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\ndevelopment  has  not  been  matched  with  funding  to  cover  the  recurrent  costs  of  the \ninvestments.  Staff  salaries  are  relatively  low  (and  often  not  paid  on  time)  but  the  non-salary \nrecurrent  budget,  at  about  7%  of  the  provincial  health  budget,  is  very  low  as  well.  Health \nfacilities  must  generate  an  operating  budget  from  overhead  on  the  sale  of  medicines,  thereby \nmaking health services less affordable and encouraging overprescription. The recurrent budget  \nmust increase about fourfold to cover the recurrent costs of health facilities. The goals of greater \nequity and improved service quality are thus undermined. The MOH will have to cut back on its \ninvestments  and  make  the  best  use  of  limited  resources  by  strengthening  planning  and \nbudgeting,  economic  analysis,  health  personnel  planning,  and  provincial  and  district \nmanagement capacity.     \n \n29. \nCost  recovery  was  introduced  in  the  Lao  PDR  in  the  early  1990s,  mainly  through  the \nsale  of  drugs  financed  from  DRFs.  Based  on  1999  data,  domestically  financed  government \nspending is less than the contribution from user fees.20 The MOH estimates that more than half \nof  the  operating  costs  of  central  and  provincial  hospitals  and  one  third  of  those  of  district \nhospitals are now met through cost recovery. Under a new Curative Law, the Decree on Fees \nand Charges (December 2005) allows public agencies to expand the types of charges and fees \nfor services, and to use revenue from fees to cover salaries and other recurrent costs. However, \nthe concern is that, even with expanded cost recovery, there might be no net increase in health \nsector financing because of a reduction in the central budget allocation, as revenue is integrated \nwith the formal fiscal year budget. The actual surplus from the estimated fee income will go to \nthe Treasury, and actual deficits in anticipated fee income may lead to central budget subsidies \nonly after a formal audit.  \n \n\n6. \n\nMaking Health Care Affordable to the Poor \n\n30.  While  user  fees  play  an  important  role  in  health  system  financing,  they  are  not  the \nsolution  to  the  problem  of  underfunding  for  the  recurrent  costs  of  health  facilities.  Studies \naround  the  world  have  shown  that  user  fees  at  public  facilities,  even  with  accompanying \nexemption schemes for the poor, deter the poor from using health services.  \n \n31. \nLow affordability of services, especially for the poor, is believed to be a major cause of \nunderutilization of services in the Lao PDR. The income disparity between the poor and nonpoor \nhas  increased,  and  the  cost  of  health  care  has  gone  up  substantially  over  the  past  several \nyears. The introduction of cost recovery for drugs is likely to have made health care even less \naffordable, and the new Decree on Fees and Charges under the Curative Law may exacerbate \nmatters.  While  the  poor  are  unable  to  pay  for  services,  there  is  not  enough  public  finance  to \nprovide them with free services.  \n \n32. \nHouseholds obtain about 90% of their medicine needs through out-of-pocket spending. \nThis implies that free medicines are very limited in the health system and the poor may not be \ngetting the medicines they need. A market is thus created for cheap counterfeit drugs that are \nunsafe and contribute to drug-resistant diseases. Exemptions for the poor are supposed to be \ncovered  by  the  DRF  and  government  contributions.  According  to  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) estimates, exemptions for hospital services range between 2.2% and 21.1% of the DRF. \nThis level of funding is not enough to cover the needs of the poor. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Schwartz,  J.

Vientiane.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nNone  of  the  three  formal  health  insurance  schemes\u2014civil  servant  health  insurance, \n33. \nsocial  security  fund,  and  community-based  health  insurance\u2014benefits  the  poor.  These \nschemes, with a total coverage of 1% of the population, are not a viable option for making the \nservices  more  affordable  to  the  poor  in  the  medium  term.  HEFs  have  been  successfully \npilot-tested in a few districts to compensate hospitals for the \u201closs\u201d they incur when treating the \npoor. The MOH wants to widen the application of HEFs.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons  \n\n34. \nADB, the World Bank, and bilateral agencies have assisted the Government of the Lao \nPDR in putting in place a basic network of hospitals, health centers, and village activities, and \nPHC coverage has improved substantially. The PHC Project21 was aimed at expanding access \nto  basic  health  services  through  health  centers  in  two  provinces  and  was  evaluated  as \nsuccessful.22 The  well-performing  PHCEP  (footnote  12)  has  a  more  comprehensive  approach \nincluding  hospital  services  and  village-based  health  care  in  eight  northern  provinces,  and  the \nstrengthening of provincial management nationwide. A similar approach is followed by the World \nBank in the southern provinces.           \n \n35. \nA  major  issue  under  the  PHCEP  was  how  to  shift  focus  from  inputs  (in  particular,  civil \nworks)  to  outcomes,  given  the  challenge  of  navigating  complex  procurement  procedures  to \nensure quality inputs. It was felt that technical staff should preferably not be involved in project \nadministration but concentrate on outcomes. The PHCEP proved its flexibility by making some \nadjustments when a shortfall in indicators, in particular for immunization, was noted.  \n \nExperience  in  the  PHCEP  demonstrated  the  difficulty  of  integrating  the  centrally \n36. \nmanaged  vertical  health  programs  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  Essentially,  two  factors \naccounted for this difficulty. Vertical programs typically do  not allow for sharing resources and \npooling funds, making joint activities difficult, and PHC is often perceived as a vertical program \nitself. Strong provincial leadership can, however, foster greater integration of health programs.  \n \n37. \nThe  PHCEP  showed  the  effectiveness  of  using  a  geographic  information  system  in \nhealth service zoning to plan the location of new health centers. This approach greatly reduced \nthe number of health centers that needed to be built, and optimized the catchment area for each \nhealth  center,  thereby  making  the  investments  more  efficient.  In  addition,  a  village  health \nprogram  was  added  to  improve  access  for  villages  located  more  than  2  hours  walking  from  a \nhealth facility.   \n \n38. \nTo find staff for remote health centers, under PHCEP, school students living near health \ncenters  were  selected  and  provided  with  vocational  training.  This  practice  produced  health \nworkers who were integrated and able to thrive in the local community. The recruits committed \nto  working  in  the  health  center  for  several  years.  Given  the  low  school  attainment  in  these \nlocations,  about  one  third  of  trainees,  especially  among  the  women,  were  first  given  general \neducation  to  qualify  for  vocational  training.  The  MOH  is  now  extending  this  approach  to  other \ncadres.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB.  1995.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nUnder  the  PHCEP,  the  project  management  office  built  up  considerable  administrative \n39. \ncapacity and established strong provincial linkages, but could not spread this know-how in the \nMOH.  Similar  project  procurement  and  financial  management  functions  for  foreign-assisted \nprojects  are  spread  over  several  departments  in  the  MOH,  involving  large  transaction  costs, \nduplication, project delays, competition for limited staff time and consultants, and other adverse \neffects. Mainstreaming and integrating project administration in the MOH, as a building block for \nharmonized external assistance in accordance with the Paris Declaration, is therefore desirable. \n \nD. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n40. \nThe  Lao  health  sector  has  seen  a  substantial  shift  in  donor  assistance  over  the  past \n5 years. Several bilateral donors have been phasing out their programs as global funds moved \nin.  The  MOH\u2019s  Health  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  presents  a  budget  of  $323  million, \nimplying  a  doubling  in  public  spending.  Donors  have  pledged  $99  million  in  contributions, \ncompared  with  the  proposed  $177  million.  With  a  planned  share  of  $44  million  from  the \nGovernment  and  a  community  share  of  $32  million,  the  expected  funding  gap  over  5  years  is \n$71 million. External assistance to Lao\u2019s health sector is summarized in Appendix 2.      \n \n41. \nExternal assistance to the health sector is fragmented and typically supports a specific \nsubsector  or  geographic  area.  PHC  and  communicable  disease  control  receive  the  most \nfunding. Assistance for HRD is mostly for in-service training under various projects. The Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency supports nursing education.   \n \n42. \nPHC in the north is being supported by ADB, and in the south by the World Bank, while \nPHC  models  have  been  pilot-tested  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development, \nBelgian  Technical  Cooperation,  the  Government  of  Luxembourg,  and  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency.  PHC  projects  follow  similar  approaches  but  need  to  be  harmonized \nfurther. Maternal and child health, nutrition, and immunization are being supported as separate \nprograms by the United Nations and other agencies, and need to be integrated with PHC. The \npullout of several bilateral agencies has led to a decline in funding for PHC in recent years.  \n \nIn  communicable  disease  control,  the  establishment  of  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight  AIDS, \n43. \nTuberculosis  and  Malaria  has  significantly  increased  funding  for  malaria  and  tuberculosis \ncontrol,  and  recently  also  for  HIV/AIDS  (footnote  8).

Its aim \nis to improve health and nutrition behavior and use of health services and make the provincial \nhealth system more effective, efficient, and equitable in delivering PHC.  \n \n45. \nThe objectives of the Project are (i) to improve PHC delivery, particularly for vulnerable \ngroups, in the eight northern provinces, and (ii) to strengthen MOH capacity for health system \ndevelopment  nationwide,  including  planning  and  budgeting,  financing,  HRD,  and  coordination. \nThe  Project  has  two  corresponding  components  and  is  based  on  a  two-phased  PHC \ndevelopment  concept  covering  8 years,  with  the  Project  supporting  the  first  phase  of  4  years \n(2007\u20132011). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3.  \n \nThe  Project  is  set  within  the  framework  of  the  NSEDP6  and  PHC  policy,  and  supports \n46. \ntheir expected outcomes, priorities, and plans. It will contribute to the improvement of key health \nindicators  to  achieve  the  MDGs  in  the  medium  term,  and  to  health  system  development  to \nsustain health benefits in the longer term. The ADB-supported PHCEP and other projects in the \neight northern provinces helped establish a considerable network of health facilities. The MOH \nhas  requested  ADB  to  help  improve  the  functioning  and  use  of  the  PHC  network  while \nexpanding PHC to remote populations without such services. About 19 out of 62 districts in the \neight northern provinces still have substantial populations living in social and physical isolation.  \n \n47. \nThe MOH is moving from a traditional, input-driven, centralized public health system to a \nmodern,  results-based  health  system  with  strong  community  participation  and  novel  ways  of \novercoming barriers in public education and PHC delivery. For PHC to become more effective, \nefficient, and equitable, and benefit those who need it most, the fragmented health system must \nbe better integrated and substantially decentralized. Building on the strong relationship that ADB \nhas formed with the MOH in health system development over the past decade, the Project will \nsupport  the  strengthening  of  policy  and  capacity  for  health  system  development  nationwide. \nProject support for sector policies is summarized in Appendix 4.  \n \nB. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: Improving PHC Delivery   \n\n \n48. \nADB  has  been  supporting  the  eight  northern  provinces  under  the  PHC  Expansion \nProject  (footnote  12),  and  wants  to  continue  supporting  this  region  in  view  of  the  poor  health \nstatus of its people, many of them from ethnic groups, the high level of poverty, ADB\u2019s current \nrole  in  the  development  of  this  region,  and  the  need  to  further  enhance  the  impact  of  past \ninvestments.  The  first  component  is  therefore  concerned  with  improving  PHC  delivery  in  eight \nnorthern  provinces  and  includes  three  subcomponents:  (i)  improving  PHC  management  and \nquality  of  care;  (ii)  increasing  access  to  PHC,  in  particular  for  women  and  ethnic  groups;  and \n(iii) increasing PHC financing and affordability for the poor.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\na. \n \n\nImproving PHC Management and Quality of Care  \n\n \n \n49. \nAccording  to  government  policy,  PHC  is  to  be  the  overarching  principle  that  integrates \nservices  and  programs,  including  those  for  maternal  and  child  health,  nutrition,  immunization, \nand communicable disease control, into one comprehensive approach. Government instructions \nfor decentralized, integrated management have largely not been implemented for lack of central \nsupport, managerial know-how and motivation, and limited pooling of resources. Good practices \nin Xaignabouri and Xiang Khouang provinces and other successful pilot areas are being studied \nwith  the  intention  of  implementing  these  more  widely,  as  appropriate. 25  PHC  management \nguidelines developed under the PHCEP for all levels will be improved further and implemented \nwith the help of a PHC system expert, who will also work as chief technical adviser.   \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  eight  northern  provinces  to  strengthen  district  PHC \n50. \nmanagement and introduce the results-based approach (it will support the provinces in strategic \nplanning  in  component  2).  District  teams  in  the  eight  northern  provinces  will  be  assisted  in \npreparing  annual  plans  and  budgets,  with  the  help  of  a  supplementary  grant  based  on  the \nsatisfactory achievement of specific targets, activities, and outputs. The provincial management \nteams will be assisted in supporting the implementation and monitoring of these plans. Reasons \nfor  noncompliance  in  management  procedures  and  poor  performance  will  be  examined,  and \naddressed,  as  possible.  Analytical  capacity  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels  will  be \nstrengthened  (see  component  2).  Because  appropriate  health  management  information  is \nessential for results-based planning, the data collection and reporting system will be improved.  \n \n51. \nGiven an appropriate policy framework and basic resources, capable management is the \ndriving  force  for  better  PHC  delivery.  District  health  managers  are  central  to  achieving  better \nhealth  outcomes,  by  planning  ahead,  negotiating  support,  coordinating  resources,  motivating \nstaff, pursuing high-quality care, and tracking performance. Around the world, the performance \nof district health managers has been associated with achieving results. The Project will support  \nin-service  training  of  district  health  managers  that  will  be  intermittent,  skill-based,  and \ninteractive, using available know-how from other countries. Successful classroom work and field \nassignments  for  a  total  duration  of  3  months  will  be  awarded  with  a  certificate  in  PHC \nmanagement. The Project will thereby help groom a new generation of health managers. After \nthe  training,  the  district managers  are  expected  to  be  familiar  with  the  basics  of  results-based \ndistrict  health  management  including  planning  and  budgeting,  integrated  PHC  delivery,  and \nfinancial and personnel management. For well-performing district health managers, the Project \nwill offer two regional master-level scholarships in public health each year.  \n \n52. \nThe  Project  will  help  establish  an  Internet  network  for  district  health  offices  in  at  least  \nhalf  of  the  Project  districts  including  software  development,  equipment,  training,  and  recurrent \ncosts.  This  network  will  be  linked  to  the  MOH  statistical  unit,  which  will  also  be  strengthened \n(see  component 2).  The  Project  will  likewise  support  in-service  training  for  about  1  week  per \nyear  for  all  health  center  managers,  in  such  topics  as  integrated  PHC  services  and \nmanagement,  outreach  services,  supervision  of  the  village  health  and  nutrition  program,  work \nplanning, technical standards, monitoring, and reporting. \n \n53. \nOn the technical side, the Project will support the eight northern provinces in improving \nthe  quality  of  care  at  all  levels.  Substantial  progress  was  made  under  PHCEP  and  other \nprojects.  However,  the  inadequate  practical  skills  of  staff,  lack  of  standards  and  supervision, \n\n                                                 \n25  E.g., training programs in provincial and district health management (PHCEP); district management manual (Swiss \n\nRed Cross); provincial financial management manual (Belgian Technical Cooperation). \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nad hoc in-service training, and outdated equipment continue to be common problems. The MOH \nis  now  updating  the  standards  and  job  descriptions  for  district  hospitals  and  VHVs,  and  has \nalready  approved  a  similar  package  for  health  centers.  The  Project  will  help  implement  these \nguidelines through workshops and training activities. \n \n54. \nAt health centers, the Project will address shortages of staff, particularly female staff and \nstaff  from  ethnic  groups,  by  continuing  the  successful  PHC  worker  training  program  begun  in \n2002 under the PHCEP. Under this program, students were recruited from the vicinity of health \ncenters with a staff shortage, and trained on scholarship for 2.5 years to become PHC workers. \nBridging education was provided to candidates who did not meet education prerequisites. Under \nthe Project, at least 48 students will be provided with bridging education and 275 PHC workers \nwill  be  trained,  to  meet  the  current  shortfalls.  The  MOH  will  recruit  the  candidates,  preferably \nfemales and members of ethnic groups.  \n \n55. \nThe MOH also proposes to create the position of PHC officer, similar to the former job of \nmedical assistant. While PHC workers address an immediate need, further improvement of the \nquality of care needs better-trained staff. The PHC officer would be a mid-level PHC manager \nand provider posted in rural facilities. The MOH plans to build a regional school for PHC officers \nin  Louang  Phrabang,  with  civil  works  to  be  completed  by  the  Government  with  private  sector \nsupport. The feasibility study was done under the PHCEP. The Project will provide managerial \nand technical support for school and hostel developments, equipment and furniture, curriculum \ndevelopment, and stipends for the first two batches of students. In selecting students, the MOH \nwill use an approach similar to the one being used in selecting PHC workers.  \n    \nThe  Project  will  help  strengthen  the  in-service  training  program  to  address  the  lack  of \n56. \npractical skills of staff, and incorporate the program in the recurrent budget (under component \n2). On average, one staff per health center and three staff per district health office and hospital \nwill  receive  in-service  training  each  year.  The  Project  will  support  the  preparation  of  training \npackages,  training  of  trainers,  and  provision  of  training  materials.  It  will  also  make  available \nequipment and interactive audiovisual software for training (a recent pilot study for immunization \nwas  highly  successfully).  Competent  practitioners  will  be  trained  as  teachers  (see  component \n2).  In  addition  to  short-term  training,  240  provincial,  88  national,  and  20  regional  scholarships \nwill  be  provided.  An  important  aspect  of  the  program  is  the  continuity  of  in-service  training, \ninstead of the current ad hoc and project-based approach. \n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  also  provide  eight  multipurpose  vehicles  for  provincial  outreach, \nincluding audiovisual equipment for road shows, and drugs to supplement those covered by the \nDRFs  for  district  hospitals  and  health  centers.  Outdated  equipment  at  health  centers  will  be \nreplaced as needed.  \n\n \nb. \n\nIncreasing Access to PHC  \n\n \n58. \nIn  the  eight  northern  provinces,  the  PHCEP  has  been  supporting  a  village  health \nprogram for all villages beyond a 2-hour walk from a health facility. A total of 6,064 village health \nvolunteers have been trained and provided with drug kits for basic curative care. The demand \nfor  these  services  has  been  very  high.  To  complement  village  health  care,  and  in  the  light  of \nexperience gained from the HIV prevention program, a peer education program was pilot-tested  \nto  improve  health  and  nutrition  behavior  in  the  family  and  community.  This  approach  has \nproduced various successful health and nutrition initiatives in the villages.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  upgrading  of  about  6,000  VHVs  and  the  training  of  1,000 \n59. \nnew VHVs. The distribution of village drug kits will be expanded to selected villages, and 1,000 \nbicycles  will  be  provided  to  help  restock  medicines.  The  peer  education  program  will  be \nexpanded to 3,800 villages (82% of the total in the eight provinces). Village health committees \nwill  be  mobilized,  and  12,800  peer  educators  will  be  trained  in  health  care  and  nutrition \npromotion, in schools and elsewhere. The MOH is developing a nutrition policy and action plan \nto  address  serious  malnutrition.  The  Project  will  support  the  implementation  of  accepted \nnutrition interventions by providing education and supplies like micronutrients and anthelmintics.  \n \n60. \nThe  Project  will  make  safe  motherhood  services  more  accessible  to  rural  populations. \nMidwives  will  be  trained,  and  selected  hospitals  will  be  upgraded  to  enable  them  to  provide \nemergency  obstetric  services.  In-service  training  in  safe  motherhood  and  delivery  skills  has \nbeen  pilot-tested  successfully  under  the  current  PHCEP.  Certificate  training  in  basic  obstetric \ncare  will  be  provided  for  3  months  to  340  health  center  staff.  In  addition,  36  nurse-midwives \nfrom  remote  districts  will  be  given  scholarships  for  3-year  preservice  training.  Students  from \nremote districts often cannot afford the considerable fees, as a visit to regional nursing schools \nrevealed. Women with basic literacy including traditional birth attendants will be encouraged to \nbecome VHVs, and VHVs will be trained to refer emergencies to nearby health facilities.   \n \n61.   As much as half of the MMR is attributed to lack of access to emergency services. The \nProject will therefore support the upgrading of the Paklay and Xienghone (Xaignabouri) district \nhospitals to type A hospitals, and the construction of type B hospitals in Viengxay (Houaphan) \nand Nateuy (Louang Namtha), to provide obstetric and other emergency services. The Project \nwill  support  environmentally  sound  facilities  and  equipment,  and  training  and  monitoring  in \nwaste  management.  It  will  also  provide  16  ambulances  for  district  hospitals,  and  replace \noutdated  hospital  equipment.  The  Project  will  likewise  explore  the  possibility  of  a  hardship \nallowance for health staff in district hospitals and health centers and expedite it where possible \non a pilot basis.   \n \n62. \nThe Project will support the expansion of basic health services through the construction \nof  health  centers  for  populations  that  have  little  or  no  access  to  these services,  usually  ethnic \nminority populations in remote areas. Ten new health centers will be built. The Project will also \nsupport  the  replacement  of  11  old  health  centers  and  the  repair  of  40  others,  out  of  a  total  of \n335 health centers. New as well as refurbished centers will be equipped.   \n \n\nc. \n\nIncreasing PHC Financing and Affordability for the Poor \n\n63. \nThe Project will help (i) improve health care financing, and (ii) pilot-test a provincial HEF \nfor  the  poor.  The  funding  of  recurrent  costs  in  the  health  sector  has  been  very  low.  Hospitals \nand  health  centers  received  supplementary  funds  for  operations  under  several  projects.  Such \nfunding  has  had  major  impact  on  PHC  delivery,  and  will  also  be  supported  under  the  Project. \nThis budget will be linked to results such as output of the health facilities. Provincial and district \nhospitals  and  offices  will  be  reimbursed  for  actual  expenditures,  and  health  centers  will  be \nextended modest grants-in-aid.  \n \n \n \n64. \nThe Project will make health care more affordable to about 185,000 poor people in three \nprovinces  (Xaignabouri,  Xiangkhouang,  and  Oudomxai)  through  province-wide  HEF.  All  those \nliving below the poverty line26 (about 25% in the targeted provinces) will be able to benefit from \n\n                                                 \n26 The poverty line used here is defined as (i) a food poverty line, or (ii) an overall poverty line. The food poverty line \nthreshold  is  2,100  calories  per  day  per  person,  which  the  World  Health  Organization  and  other  international \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nthe  HEF.  A  system  of  means  testing  is  already  in  place,  and  the  poor  have  been  identified. \nReimbursements will be paid out of the HEF for all public health care costs and transportation \nfor emergencies including obstetric emergencies; such costs are often a major barrier to access \nfor the poor. Reimbursements from the HEF will cover the health service expenses of the poor \non  a  fee-for-service  basis  for  hospitals,  and  a  capitation  basis  for  health  centers  and  VHVs. \nTrained fund management committees, trained staff, field support, fund management oversight \nby  an  accounting  firm,  and  technical  support  will  be  needed  to  implement  the  HEF.  The \nimplementation design of the HEF is outlined in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening Capacity for Health System Development  \n\n65. \nThis component will support the MOH and the 17 provinces in (i) strengthening capacity \nfor  HRD,  (ii)  strengthening  planning  and  budgeting,  and  (iii)  integrating  project  administration \nand coordination.   \n \n\nStrengthening MOH Capacity for HRD  \n\na. \n \n\n66. \nThe Department of Organization and Personnel (DOP) must be strengthened to improve \nits capacity to carry out its mandate. The Project will support the DOP with three scholarships \n(in  policy  and  planning,  teaching  methodology,  and  human  resource  management),  four \n3-month  attachments  to  human  resource  departments  in  the  region,  and  operational  support. \nThe Project will also provide a long-term consultant and support the HRD task force.  \n \n67. \nFor  better  workforce  planning  and  management,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the \nmanagement  information  system  for  the  MOH  workforce  through  a  national  survey  of  health \npersonnel  and  an  improved  staff  personnel  database.  It  will  also  support  the  strengthening  of \nhuman  resource  management  including  the  revision  of  the  manual  on  health  personnel \noperations  and  management,  and  support  for  an  orientation  program  for  new  staff,  job \ndescriptions for the provinces (currently being prepared), and performance appraisal tools.  \n  \n68. \nTo  improve  the  quality  of  training  programs  for  lower  and  mid-level  staff,  as  the  DOP \nplans  to  do,  the  Project  will  support  the  development  of  training  standards,  the  review  of \ncurricula,  the  assessment  of  graduates,  the  strengthening  of  in-service  training,  and  the \ndevelopment  of  standard  in-service  training  modules  on  key  topics.  The  capacity  of  provincial \ntrainers  will  also  be  strengthened,  annual  provincial  training  plans  developed,  and  training \nmaterials  and  supplies  provided  under  this  component.  Education  planning,  skill  training, \nimproved teaching methods, need-based training, and impact assessment will be emphasized.  \n \n69. \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  development  of  the  national  human  resource  policy  and \nlong-term  strategic  human  resource  plan  being  prepared  by  the  MOH.  In  coordination  with \ngovernment  agencies,  the  Project  will  support  induction  to  international  workforce  policy, \nplanning,  and  management  practices;  policy  planning \nforce; \ndissemination activities; and monitoring.  \n \n\nthe  HRD \n\nthrough \n\ntask \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \norganizations have determined to be the basic requirement for people in Lao PDR. Those with less than this daily \ncalorie intake are considered to be living below the food poverty line. The cost of acquiring this intake plus 20% for \nnonfood  necessities  determines  the  overall  poverty  line.  Source:  Government  of  Lao  PDR.  2004.

The  Project  will \nsupport several of these building blocks in coordination with other stakeholders.    \n \n \nThe Project will help strengthen strategic planning and budgeting in 17 provinces based \n71. \non the concept of an integrated provincial health system pilot-tested in several districts. Under \nthe  guidance  of  the  provincial  committee  for  health,  provincial  health  management  teams  will \nconduct  a  strategic  planning  exercise  to  improve  their  5-year  plans  and  prepare  medium-term \nexpenditure frameworks showing all likely sources and uses of funds, among others, to ensure \nadequate funding of basic public health functions and recurrent expenditures. These plans will \nbe  used  in  preparing  annual  plans  and  budgets  for  provincial  health  system  development \naccording  to  national  targets  and  local  priorities.  The  Project  will  support  the  orientation  of \nprovincial  governments  and  other  stakeholders;  the  preparation  of  guidelines,  standards,  and \nprocedures  for  strategic  planning  and  budgeting;  staff  training;  international  and  national \nconsulting services; and the provision of equipment and vehicles, and operational support.       \n \n72.     To strengthen the analytical capacity of the MOH in health economics and financing, the \nProject will support the division of health financing in the Department of Planning and Budgeting \n(DPB)  of  the  MOH.  Three  scholarships  in  health  economics  and  health  policy,  consulting \nservices, and financing studies will be supported (see also Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n73. \nGiven the challenges of developing risk pooling systems in the Lao PDR, cost recovery \nwill  remain  the  predominant  mode  of  financing  for  non-salary  recurrent  costs.  Under  the  new \nCurative  Law  (2006),  hospitals  and  health  centers  can  now  charge  for  fees  and  hospital  stay, \nbesides charging for medicines and diagnostic services. While this makes costing more realistic, \nit will also increase charges and cause the poor and near-poor further hardship. The Project will \nsupport  health  financing  studies  including  (i) the  impact  of  the  new  Curative  Law;  (ii)  hospital \npricing, to set HEF reimbursement rates for services for the poor; (iii) HEF performance; (iv) use \nof loan funds; and (v) results-based supplementary operational financing. The division of health \nfinancing will be assisted in systematically tracking and monitoring all sources and uses of funds \nin the health sector. The studies are listed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n \n \n74. \nAdministrative project implementation capacity is poorly distributed within the MOH. It is \nlocked-in under a few projects and often not sustained when projects are completed, resulting in \nconsiderable  inefficiencies  in  the  MOH.  The  MOH  plans  to  mainstream  project  management \ncapacity.  Combining  the  administration  of  several  externally  funded  interventions  in  the  health \nsector  will  improve  MOH  capacity  and  efficiency,  and  foster  synergies  between  projects.  The \nProject  will  support  the  strengthening  of  DPB  to  enable  it  to  handle  routine  administrative \nfunctions  including  civil  works,  procurement  of  goods,  financial  management,  and  general \nproject  administration.  Technical  functions  and  coordination  with  agencies  will  remain  with  the \nconcerned  technical  units.  A  major  responsibility  will  be  to  improve  the  flow  of  funds  and \nfinancial  management  of  projects.  DPB  will  also  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  provinces  in \nfinancial  management  by  standardizing  and  improving  financial  management  systems.  The \nProject will support initial design and regulatory work, and administrative and capacity-building \noperations for 4 years. An accounting firm will be hired to oversee the financial management of \n\nIntegrating Project Administration and Coordination \n\nc. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nProject Investment Plan  \n\nDPB and train its staff. A project coordination unit will be responsible for ADB matters, while all \nadministrative and technical matters will be mainstreamed in the MOH.  \n \nC. \n \n75. \nThe Project is estimated to cost $15.0 million equivalent for the 4-year period (October \n2007\u2013September  2011),  including  taxes,  duties,  and  contingencies  (Table  1).  At  base  costs, \nimproving PHC delivery is estimated to cost $11.2 million (81%), and strengthening capacity in \nhealth system development, $2.6 million (19%). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 5.   \n \nD. \n \nADB will provide a grant of $13.0 million from its Special Funds resources to cover 87% \n76. \nof  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will  provide  $2.0  million  equivalent  in  counterpart \nfunds.27 Table  2  shows  the  financing  plan  according  to  source  of  funds.

The  project \n77. \ndirector  will  be  the  director  of  DPB,  who  will  be  assisted  by  a  project  coordination  unit.  The \nProject will be implemented otherwise through DPB and the departments concerned\u2014primarily \nDOP and eight PHOs\u2014as implementing agencies, and in coordination with the Cabinet, and the \nCurative,  Prevention  and  Hygiene,  Food  and  Drug,  and  Inspection  departments  of  the  MOH. \nThe project organization structure is in Appendix 6.  \n \n78. \nThe  MOH  Steering  Committee  will  provide  overall  guidance  in  project  implementation. \nThe steering committee is chaired by the Minister of Health, and comprises representatives of \ndepartments  of  the  MOH.  Representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  Ministry  of \nEducation, the Committee for Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Office will join the committee as required. The MOH has also established task \nforces  for  HRD,  PHC,  and  health  financing;  these  will  meet  monthly  to  provide  technical \nguidance in these subsectors.  \n \n79. \nThe  project  coordination  unit  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  providing  project  coordination, \n(ii) coordinating  with  departments  and  agencies,  (iii)  preparing  and  managing  the  annual  plan \nand  budget,  (iv) providing  guidance  to  implementing  agencies,  (v)  monitoring  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  (vi)  ensuring  that  ADB  requirements  are  being  complied  with, \n(vii) monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project,  (viii)  submitting  quarterly  progress  and  financial \nreports,  and  (ix)  conducting  reviews  and  surveys.  The  unit  will  be  managed  by  two  deputy \ndirectors and a planning and budgeting officer.    \n \n80. \nDPB  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  (ii)  consulting \nservices,  and  (iii)  administrative  and  financial  management.  The  Project  will  support  DPB  with \ncontractual staff for administration, accounting, procurement, civil works, and monitoring.  \n \n81. \nIn each province, the Project will be managed directly by the PHO, through the existing \nPHC coordinating unit. The PHC coordinating unit will absorb the program implementation office \nof  the  PHCEP  to  mainstream  administrative  capacity.  The  provincial  steering  committee, \nchaired by the vice governor, and including representatives of the PHO, the provincial planning \nand budgeting department, the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and other offices, will provide oversight to \nthe  provincial  project  activities.  Similar  arrangements  will  be  made  in  the  districts,  while  the \nvillage health committees will oversee implementation in the villages.   \n   \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n82. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  4  years,  from  1  October  2007  to  30  September \n2011, and the grant will close by 31 March 2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n83. \nAll ADB-financed procurement will be done according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan with indicative contract packages \nis in Appendix 8. Goods and services $100,000 and above and all civil works will be procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding.  Vehicles  will  be  procured  through  the  United  Nations \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nsystem;  its  procurement  procedures  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  Minor  goods  and  services  other \nthan civil works and vehicles costing less than $100,000 may be procured through shopping.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n84. \nThe Project will require five international consultants for a total of 47 person-months, five \nnational consultants for a total of 90 person-months, and architect and accounting services. The \ninternational experts in PHC systems (21 person-months), health policy and planning (6 person-\nmonths)  and  health  economics  (8  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for hiring consultants. The architect and accounting services \nwill  be  hired  through  separate  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal  and \nconsultant  qualification  selection  or  least-cost  selection  method.  Other  consultants  will  be \ncontracted  through  one  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nusing the fixed budget selection method and biodata technical proposal. This package includes \ninternational experts in HRD (9 person-months) and social development (3 person-months); and \nnational  experts  in  health  information  (24  person-months),  health  policy  and  planning  (12 \nperson-months),  HRD  (24  person-months),  health  care  financing  (24  person-months),  and \nsocial  development  (6  person-months).  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services \nare in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n \n85. \nThe  MOH  will  take  advance  action  to  speed  up  project  implementation.  It  will  hire \ninternational and national consultants, train project and provincial staff to implement the Project, \nand prepare bidding documents for major civil works. ADB will not finance expenditures paid by \nthe Government before the grant takes effect. ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the related expenditures under the Project or to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n86. \nThe  project  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Each fiscal year, DPB will see \nto  it  that  each  participating  department  and  province  prepares  annual  reports,  plans,  and \nbudgets and has these approved by the MOH steering committee before any funds are released. \nThe  MOH  and  the  MOF  will  ensure  the  timely  release  of  funds.  Supplementary  Appendix  C \ndescribes the flow of funds.  \n \n87.  \nThe MOF will open an imprest account for the Project at the Bank of Lao PDR. ADB will \ndeposit  in  the  account  an  estimated  6  months\u2019  expenditure  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount, \nwhichever is less. DPB of the MOH will open a second-generation imprest account to manage \nproject funds for the MOH at any bank acceptable to the MOH and ADB, and MOF will deposit \nan  estimated  6  months\u2019  expenditure  or  $500,000,  whichever  is  less,  in  this  account.  The \nstatement of expenditure (SOE) procedure may be used in obtaining reimbursement for eligible \nproject  expenditures  and  in  liquidating  advances  from  the  imprest  account  or  replenishing  the \naccount.  The  SOE  procedure  applies  to  contracts  of  not  more  than  $100,000  equivalent  per \npayment  and  to  the  liquidation  of  advances  made  from  the  imprest  account  according  to  the \nfinancial  covenants  of  the  grants.  Detailed  arrangements  for  establishing  the  imprest  account \nand  the  SOE  procedure  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Adequate \nsupporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  must  be  kept  at \neach level of project management to substantiate all expenditures made with the grant proceeds.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\n \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n88. \nThe EA will hire an accounting firm for financial management according to the terms of \nreference in Appendix 9. The MOH and the provincial governments will keep separate records \nand  accounts  for  the  Project,  identifying  the  goods  and  services  financed  with  the  grant \nproceeds. The EA has implemented similar projects financed by ADB and others in the last 10 \nyears.  Past  experience  and  the  results  of  the  assessment  indicate  satisfactory  financial \nmanagement capacity on the part of the EA (details are in Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \n89. \nThe State Audit Organization in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office or other certified auditor will \naudit each year all accounts and financial statements, SOEs and revenues, and activities in the \nimprest account related to the Project, according to auditing standards acceptable to ADB and \ninternational  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project \naccounts,  together  with  the  report  of  the  auditor,  including  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of \ngrant  proceeds,  compliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under \nADB\u2019s SOE procedure, will be submitted not later than 9 months after the financial year.28 \n   \n90. \nThe EA will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation within \n30  days  of  the  end  of  each  quarter.  The  progress  reports  will  be  in  English  and  in  a  format \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  will  indicate,  among  other  things,  progress  made  against  established \ntargets,  problems  encountered  during  the  previous  quarter,  steps  taken  to  resolve  problems, \ncompliance  with  grant  covenants,  and  the  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the  succeeding \nquarter.  Within  3  months  after  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  MOH  will  submit  to \nADB a project completion report with details of program implementation and accomplishments.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was discussed with the MOH as \n91. \nthe EA for the Project. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  The  MOH  has \nhandled four ADB projects through the same administrative unit, which is now familiar with ADB \nprocedures and anticorruption measures. The previous projects helped set clear procedures for \nthe procurement of equipment and civil works, with financial management support from a private \naccounting firm. There have not been any major audit issues or instances of suspected fraud. \nThe EA plans activities in detail, under the supervision of an international consultant, and holds \nweekly meetings to plan and report on activities and generally ensure transparency. To support \nthese  efforts,  MOH  staff  not  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  undergo  orientation, \nand ADB review missions will include discussions on corruption. A statement of this policy will \nbe part of the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project will specify the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as \nthey  relate  to  the  Project.  Governance-related  risks  will  be  further  minimized  through  the \nimplementation  of  a  Governance  Action  Plan  to  be  developed  jointly  by  the  MOH  and  the \nprovinces to improve efficiency of program implementation, enhance the quality of outputs, and \nprevent fraud and corruption. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n28 Due to logistical constraints, submission of audited financial statements and audited project accounts is extended. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n9. \n\n10. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n \n92. \nDistrict  hospitals  and  health  centers  will  be  upgraded  on  existing  land;  hence,  no \nresettlement issues are expected. The 11 new health centers will, as a matter of priority, be built \nonly  on  vacant  and  idle  land  owned  by  the  Government  that  is  free  from  all  encumbrances, \nhabitation, dispute, or controversy. However, since the final site for each subproject has not yet \nbeen  selected,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), to guide the preparation of a resettlement plan, should \nthere be any land acquisition impact (Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix D).  \n \n \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  environmental  impacts  were  reviewed  through  rapid  environmental \n93. \nassessment;  no  significant  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  The  Project  will  support  the \nconstruction  of  district  hospitals  and  health  centers  based  on  MOH  guidelines  for  the \nconstruction  of  health  facilities  developed  under  the  PHCEP.  Environmentally  sound  medical \nwaste treatment will be included in the design of the new as well as upgraded health facilities. \nSite selection, design, construction, replacement work, and facility operation will conform to the \nrelevant regulations and standards of the Government, international good practices, and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  No  activities  resulting  from  the  Project  will  cause  pollution,  health \nhazards, or soil erosion. The Project is classified as Category C.  \n \n\nEnvironment \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \nA project performance  monitoring system  will  be established at all levels to ensure the \n94. \nachievement of the objectives of the Project. Special attention will be given to the monitoring of \nbenefits  to  the  poor,  in  particular  women,  children,  and  ethnic  groups,  using  disaggregated \nindicators. The project performance monitoring system will encompass the following elements: \n(i)  impact  and  outcome  assessment  using  the  PHCEP  end-of-project  household  survey  as \nbaseline and an end-of-project survey in the fourth project year, (ii) performance assessment of \nvillage  health  care  and  health  services  (outputs)  through  surveys,  (iii)  monitoring  of  activities \nand inputs, (iv) study of specific social and environmental aspects, and (v) monitoring of project \nmanagement and financing. The performance indicators are listed in Appendix 11. \n \n\n12. \n\nProject Review \n\n \nThe  MOH  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  and  annual  reports  on  the  progress  of  the \n95. \nProject and related policy issues (Appendix 4). The reports should review progress milestones \nvis-\u00e0-vis  the  achievement  of  project  indicators,  identify  issues,  and  propose  adjustments  as \nneeded. Within 3 months after each year following project effectiveness, the MOH will submit to \nADB a project annual report summarizing the issues related to project progress and compliance \nwith covenants.  \n \n96. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  joint  project  reviews,  including  midterm  and \ncompletion reviews. The reviews will focus on project impact, achievement of objectives, project \nactivities,  inputs,  administration,  policy  reforms,  and  institutional  and  sustainability  aspects \nincluding aid coordination. The reviews will also examine compliance with social, environmental, \nfinancial,  and  other  covenants  in  the  grant  agreement.  The  MOH  and  the  provincial \ngovernments will see to it that their staff visit the field often and join ADB in all review missions.  \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \n\n21 \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nHealth Benefits \n\n97. \nLagging health indicators compared with MDG goals and targets are primarily a result of \nhigh mortality and morbidity among the rural poor, women and children, and ethnic groups\u2014the \nprimary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project.  Targeting  these  groups  with  cost-effective  interventions \nthrough  an  already  established  PHC  system  is  expected  to  have  a  major  impact  on  key \nindicators in the medium term, and to assist the Lao PDR in achieving its MDGs.  \n \n98. \nThe  Project  incorporates  challenges  facing  ethnic  groups  in  gaining  access  to  health \nservices, and the health sector in delivering good-quality PHC services. The Project focuses on \nthe  eight  northern  provinces  with  a  high  ethnic  population,  and  is  aimed  at  (i)  widening  health \ncenter  coverage  of  ethnic  communities  by  constructing  new  health  centers  in  underserved \nethnic areas; (ii) training more ethnic PHC health workers through special bridging courses for \nstudents  who  do  not  yet  meet  the  education  prerequisites  for  entry  into  the  regular  course; \n(iii) forming a new cadre of PHC officers with functions similar to those of medical assistants, to \nbe posted as mid-level staff at health centers; (iv) expanding VHV training and peer education, \nin  particular  for  remote  ethnic  groups  and  female  VHVs;  and  (v)  making  the  training  course \ncurricula and materials sensitive to cultural and traditional practices and equitable. \n \nOn project completion, the PHC network will have improved in performance\u2014there will \n99. \nbe much more demand for services, wider coverage of essential services, and a more effective, \nefficient,  and  equitable  health  system.  Substantial  planning  and  budgeting  capacity  will  have \nbeen built up in the provinces. MOH capacity in HRD, economic and financial analysis, financial \nmanagement,  and  integrated  project  administration  will  have  been  strengthened.  The  Project \nwill have supported policies to restructure the health budget, services, and staff.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Poverty Benefits \n\n \n100.  Health  is  a  critical  asset  for  all  people  but  especially  for  the  rural  poor,  who  depend \nexclusively on physical labor to meet their daily food requirements and minimal living standards. \nIt is estimated that at any given time one quarter of poor households in the Lao PDR experience \nan  acute  illness  in  the  family,  in  addition  to  chronic  illness.  Catastrophic  illnesses  often  drive \nfamilies into poverty, but many families cannot afford even routine outpatient care. The Project \nis  aimed  at  making  health  care  more  affordable  to  the  poor.  The  emphasis  on  extending  and \nimproving  PHC  in  the  villages  will  heighten  prevention  and  make  illnesses  less  costly.  The \nexpansion of reproductive health services will reduce maternal mortality, with major impact on \nthe  well-being  of  the  family  and  the  survival  of  children.  The  health  and  nutrition  activities  will \nalso  lead  to  better  attendance  in  school  and  more  productive  schoolchildren.  A  summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n101.  The project interventions will reduce illness  and premature death in the family, thereby \nimproving  productivity  and  income.  Economic  benefits  will  also  be  derived  from  cost  savings \ndue  to  increased  health  service  coverage.  Resource  or  out-of-pocket  savings  may  flow  from \nincreased access to nearby health services (e.g., reduced transport costs) and more timely and \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nrational diagnosis and treatment that reduce treatment cost.29 More efficient health care delivery \nwill  lead  to  other  economic  benefits.  The  Project  clearly  has  cost  implications  for  the  health \nsystem,  such  as  the  expected  increase  in  PHC  staff,  but  the  rational  use  of  staff  and  other \ninputs will lead to a more efficient and qualitatively better health system and better use of past \ninvestments. The economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n \nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\n1. \n\nCommitment to Reforms \n\n102.  Achieving  project  objectives  is  predicated  on  several  assumptions  and  on  the  effective \nmitigation of certain risks (see Appendix 3). The two components of reaching vulnerable groups \nwith PHC and developing the health system are closely related and share a number of risks.  \n \n   \n \n103.  Striving  for  more  equity,  efficiency,  and  effectiveness  entails  difficult  political  choices \nabout  redistributing  control,  budgets,  staff,  and  services,  and  depends  on  the  commitment  of \nstakeholders  to  reach  vulnerable  groups  and  carry  out  reforms.  Improving  PHC  delivery  and \nreaching vulnerable groups are explicitly stated goals in NSEDP6, and past projects have given \nspecial  attention  to  reaching  these  groups  with  reasonable  success.  The  Project  proposes \nseveral new strategies and interventions to further improve benefits for these groups. The MOH \nis expected to continue to provide strong stewardship for PHC. Provincial governments will be \nguided in making choices in favor of PHC, MDGs, and health system development that provide \ngreater  benefits  to  the  poor  and  the  disadvantaged.  Central  health  programs  and  external \nagencies  must  be  supported  in  decentralizing,  integrating,  and  harmonizing  programs  and \nprojects in support of PHC. The Project will facilitate this by carrying out participatory planning, \nhelping  prepare  decrees  and  guidelines,  providing  training,  monitoring  project  activities,  and \nlinking inputs with results.     \n  \n\n2. \n\nFinancing Constraint \n\n \n104.  Domestic public funding for the health sector is about 0.8% of gross domestic product.30 \nHowever, the Government plans to increase health sector financing substantially over the next \n5 years. If PHC, which mainly benefits the poor, is to be improved and sustained, the MOH will \nneed  to  give  priority  to  PHC  rather  than  to  large  hospitals  in  using  additional  funds.  Even  so, \nwhile the economy shows strong and stable growth and increasing revenues, external funding \nwill be needed to bridge the gap in funding for the recurrent costs of PHC. The Project provides \nfor several strategies to improve health sector financing (subcomponent 1.3) and use of funds \n(subcomponent 2.2). It will also support studies to monitor health sector financing and explore \ninnovative  options.  After  the  Project,  the  MOH  is  expected  to  be  able  to  absorb  the  resulting \nadditional recurrent cost (see Appendix 13, para. 20).  \n \n \n \n105.  Project  impact  requires  substantially  improved  staff  performance,  particularly  among \nprovincial and district managers, staff providing midwifery services, and staff providing services \nin  remote  locations.  The  Project  provides  training  opportunities  and,  on  a  pilot  basis,  staff \n\nStaff Performance Constraints \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n29 Bloom and Choynowski (2003) calculated that, in Cambodia, out-of-pocket health expenditure would decrease by \n\n$6 per person with the availability of improved health services.  \n\n30 The World Bank (2006). World Development Indicators 2006, World Bank Publications. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nincentives  to  improve  staff  performance.  The  Project  will  also  improve  staff  motivation  by \nincreasing the budget for operations, maintenance, supplies, and supervision. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdministrative Risks \n\n106.  HEF  and  the  results-based  approach  are  relatively  new  in  the  MOH  and  require  new \nadministrative  procedures.  The  Project  provides  for  preparation  time,  guidelines,  technical \nexpertise,  and  accounting  services  to  ensure  proper  implementation.  Experience  with  health \nsector  projects  suggests  that  the  appointment  of  staff  and  consultants,  and  the  approval  of \nbudgets and financial arrangements, may cause start-up delays. Advance action will be taken, \nand  the  Project  will  use  existing  staff  and  established  implementation  and  funds  flow \nmechanisms to minimize these delays. \n \nC. \n\nSustainability of Project Initiatives \n\n107.  The Government\u2019s effort is severely limited by its narrow revenue base, and will continue \nto  be  fiscally  constrained  for  the  next  10  years.  Poverty  is  high  and  there  are  serious  equity \nissues associated with high cost recovery and a weak social safety net. To ensure the financial \nsustainability  of  pro-poor  activities,  fiscal  measures,  improved  sector  allocations,  improved \nallocation efficiency within the sector, and other measures are under way. Efficiency gains will \nalso be realized through the systemic reforms proposed under the Project. The division of health \nfinancing in DPB will be strengthened under the Project and will study options within the sector \nfor improving the quantity and quality of health sector financing. \n \n108.  The Project includes support for several system developments in the sector that require \nsubstantial  institutional  changes.  The  MOH  anticipates  that  integrating  of  PHC  services  and \nprograms  will  take  up  to  2015.  The  Project  supports  building  blocks  for  a  national  program \napproach  including  building  MOH  capacity,  integrating  services  and  programs,  mainstreaming \nproject  administration,  strengthening  planning  and  budgeting,  and  improving  monitoring  and \nevaluating. The MOH plans to develop a national program approach in the second phase.   \n \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n109. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nAnnual planning and budgeting. As the basis for determining provincial project \nassistance, each of the eight northern provinces will submit an annual plan and \nbudget to the MOH by 30 September 2007 and each year thereafter. Each plan \nand  budget  will  cover  all  sources  and  uses  of  funds  for  the  provincial  public \nhealth sector, and clearly show capital and recurrent expenditures. \n\nOperation  and  maintenance.  Each  of  the  eight  northern  provinces  will  ensure \nthat  from  September  2008  onward,  an  annual  budget  is  made  available  for  the \noperations  and  maintenance  of  the  village  health  program,  the  health  centers, \nand the district hospitals, based on projections agreed to by ADB and the MOH. \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  \n\nFlow of funds. The Government will ensure that ADB grant funds are transferred \nto the MOH and the provinces and reimbursements done in a timely manner. \n\n \n(iv)   Counterpart  financing.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary \n\ncounterpart funds for project implementation are provided in a timely manner.  \n\n Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  district  hospitals  and  health \ncenters  are  upgraded  on  existing  land  and  that  the  construction  of  new  health \ncenters  is  carried  out  only  on  vacant  land  and  idle  land  owned  by  the \nGovernment  that  is  free  from  any  encumbrances,  habitation,  dispute,  or \ncontroversy.  Among  other  things,  the  Government,  through  the  MOH,  shall \nscreen  all  the  activities  of  the  Project  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts. In the event that any resettlement impacts are detected for an activity, \nthe  Government  will  (i)  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  for  such  activity  in \naccordance with the agreed resettlement framework prepared for the Project and \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and (ii) ensure that (a) only sites \nwith nonsignificant (Category  B, as defined in the resettlement framework) land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  be  selected;  (b)  the  land \ndoes  not  belong  to  vulnerable  households  and  is  free  of  any  disputes  or \ncontroversies;  (c)  there  are  no  built  houses  on  the  land,  to  avoid  relocation  of \npeople; (d) there is no voluntary donation of land or other assets; (e) resettlement  \nplans  are  prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  detailed  technical  design,  disclosed  to \naffected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval;  and  (f)  all \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  assistance  is  paid  before  dispossession  of \nassets. \n\nGender  strategy  and  action  plan.  The  MOH  will  ensure  that  the  gender \nstrategy and action plan for the Project is incorporated in each provincial annual \nplan in accordance with the terms of the action plan, that gender-related activities \nare implemented in a timely manner and have adequate resources allocated for \npreparation and implementation, and that participation of female students in the \nProject is as per gender strategy and action plan (see Appendix 14).  \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nEthnic  groups.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  measures  are  undertaken  to \npromote  the  full  participation  of  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities,  such  as \ndeveloping  mechanisms  to  include  ethnic  groups  in  capacity  building  and \ntraining. It will ensure that project activities are carried out in accordance with the \nspecific actions for ethnic groups as agreed under the Project. \n\n \n(viii)  Environment.  The  Government,  through  the  MOH,  will  ensure  that  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  all  health  facilities  comply  with  all  applicable  laws \nand  regulations  of  Lao  PDR  and  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nregulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). ADB shall be informed \nif  the  construction  of  any  health  facility  requires  the  removal  of  hazardous \nmaterials.  \n\n(ix) \n\nHEF  management.  Before  HEF  is  disbursed  to  its  recipients,  the  MOH  will \nsubmit guidelines for the use and management of the HEF to ADB for approval.  \nThe guidelines will include, among other things, (a) eligibility of the recipients, (b) \nexpenditures eligible for financing from the HEF, (c) administration mechanism of \nHEF  including  accounting  and  funds  flow,  and  (d) reporting  mechanism.  The \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\nMOH  will  ensure  that  activities  financed  by  HEF  are  implemented  according  to \nthe agreed guidelines. \n\n \nB. \n\nCondition for Grant Effectiveness \n\n110.  The  condition  for  project  grant  effectiveness  is  that  MOH  will  have  confirmed  the \nestablishment of the project coordination unit and the appointment of the project director.  \n\n   \n \n\n \n7 June 2007 \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n111. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $13,000,000  to  the  Government  of  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Health System Development Project.  \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nHealth Indicators   \n\nA. \n \nThe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  has  adopted  the  United  Nations \n1. \nMillennium  Declaration  of  September  2000  and  is  committed  to  achieving  the  eight  millennium \ndevelopment goals (MDGs), four of which address health, nutrition, and population.1 As shown in \nTable A1.1, the child mortality rate was reduced from 170 to 98 per 1,000 live births from 1995 to \n2005 but is unlikely to reach the MDG of 55 per 1,000 (a two-thirds reduction) by 2015 (footnote 1, \nmain text). The maternal mortality ratio reduced from 656 to 405 per 100,000 live births from 1995 \nto  2005,  and  may  reach  250  instead  of  the  goal  of  185  per  100,000  live  births  (a  three-fourths \nreduction) by 2015. With Lao PDR being surrounded by countries with higher HIV prevalence, the \nspread of HIV/AIDS is unlikely to halt at current levels (about 1% of service women and 0.1% of \nadults aged 15-45 years) (footnote 8, main text). To sustain or improve these trends, and achieve \nMDGs, higher investments are needed in the country. \n \n\nTable A1.1: Lao PDR Health Sector Achievements, Projections, and 2015 Targets \n\n \n\nHealth Indicator \nMaternal mortality ratio \nInfant mortality rate \nUnder-5 mortality rate \nUnder-5 malnutrition rate  \n\n(weight for age) \n\nAchievements \n\n  1995 \n656 \n104 \n170 \n \n40 \n \n0 \n13 \n\n2000 \n530 \n82 \n107 \n \n40 \n  \n 0.2 \n32 \n\n2005 \n405 \n70 \n98 \n \n39 \n \n1 \n38 \n\nProjected \n2015 \n \n250 \n50 \n65 \n \n30 \n \n4 \n55 \n\nMDG \n2015 \n185 \n\u2014 \n55 \n \n20 \n \n0 \n\u2014 \n\nHIV prevalence among service  \n  women (%) \nContraceptive prevalence \nMDG = millennium development goal, \u2014 = not applicable. \nSources: Lao Census 1995, 2005; Lao Reproductive Health Survey 2000; Lao MDG Report.  \n\n \n2. \nMost children still die from common infections such as acute respiratory infections, diarrheal \ndiseases,  malaria,  and  measles.  Only  22%  of  households  in  the  northern  privinces  used \ninsecticide-treated bednet in a 2004 survey (footnote 12, main text). Full immunization coverage of \nchildren  aged  12\u201323  months  has  stagnated  at  40\u201350%  in  the  past  5  years,  and  is  among  the \nlowest globally.2 Access to safe drinking water edged up from 15% in 1995 to 35% in 2005, with \n53% of households having access to water on the premises (footnote 2). Other data suggest that \n67% of households have access to clean water.3 For 2005, estimates of sanitation coverage range \nfrom 40% to 46% (footnotes 2 and 6). Only 20% of children with diarrhea receive oral rehydration \ntreatment,  increased  fluids,  and  continued  feeding.4  In  summary,  the  coverage  of  basic \ninterventions  has  improved  unevenly.  The  coverage  indicators  of  basic  interventions  are \nparticularly low among many ethnic groups (see figure on page 30).  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  United  Nations.  2004.

The  total  fertility  rate  declined \n3. \nfrom  4.9  to  4.5  children  per  woman  between  2000  and  2005  (footnote  1,  main  text).  The \ncontraceptive prevalence rate among married women increased from 32% to 38% between 2000 to \n2005.  Unmet  need  for  family  planning  was  40%  in  2000  (footnote  9,  main  text).  The  maternal \nmortality  ratio  declined  from  655  per  100,000 live  births  in 1995  to  405  per  100,000  live  births  in \n2005  (footnote  1,  main  text).  The  2000  Reproductive  Health  Survey  showed  a  very  high \npercentage  of  pregnancies  among  adolescents  or  teenagers  (ages  15\u201319):  18.4%  of  girls  or \nwomen in this age group were either mothers or pregnant at the time of the survey. According to \nthe  same  survey,  only  23%  of  deliveries  were  attended  by  trained  health  personnel  (13%  by \ndoctors; 10% by nurses, midwives, or other health workers). The percentage of births attended by \ntrained birth attendants was less than 1%. Throughout the country, 86% of deliveries and 90% of \nrelated deaths occurred at home. Many district hospitals do not provide obstetric surgery. Even if \nsuch care is available, the costs of transport and surgery are often prohibitive (footnote 10, main \ntext).  \n \n4. \nMalnutrition is the greatest single contributing factor to child mortality in Lao PDR, with 59% \nof  all  child deaths  related  to  nutritional  deficiencies.5  Child  nutrition  has  not  improved  since  1990 \n(footnote  11,  main  text).    Poor  breast-feeding  and  weaning  practices  are  widespread.  Almost  all \nmothers  give  food  supplements  (such  as  chewed  glutinous  rice)  to  infants  within  a  few  weeks  of \nbirth. Harmful practices (such as discarding colostrum) and other food taboos for pregnant women \nreduce  disease  resistance  for  newborns  and  increase  malnutrition.  Micronutrient  deficiencies \nfurther  hinder  child  development.  Vitamin  A  capsules  now  reach  only  29%  of  children  under  5 \nyears.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Children  Fund,  based  on  initial  data  of  the  2006  multiple \nindicator cluster survey, anemia is 48.2% for children under 5 years of age and 31.3% among adult \nfemales. In 2000, 75% of households were using iodized salt.  \n \n5. \nThe prevalence of HIV  had reached 1.0% among service women and 0.1% in the general \nadult population by the end of 2005, from nil in 1990, and may be doubling every 2 years. Of the \nidentified  1,827  HIV-positive  cases  in  2005,  60%  were  male,  40%  female.  More  than  77%  were \nbetween 20 and 39 years of age. For cases where  the mode of transmission was known, 94.8% \nwere due to heterosexual intercourse and 3.9% to mother-to-child transmission (footnote 8, main \ntext).  Several  determinants,  such  as  poverty,  changing  social  patterns,  low  population  concern, \nmigration, communication, neighboring countries with epidemics, and limited control capacity, favor \nan advancing HIV/AIDS epidemic. For example, the Government reported an HIV infection rate of \nmore than 6% among 1,000 young people returning from seasonal work in Thailand. \n \nThe country has had several outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry, including one in 2006. \n6. \nTwo human cases have been identified so far. The threat of a new human influenza virus requires \nmajor  investment  in  preparedness.  Increasing  demand  for  expensive  medical  services  for  non-\ncommunicable diseases and traffic accidents puts further pressure on limited resources.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  poverty  reduction  as  its  overarching  development  goal. \nThe  Committee  on  Planning  and  Investment  has  identified  72  \u201cpoor\u201d  districts  throughout  the \ncountry  (with  2.1  million  people)  as  priority  targets  for  development.  Of  these,  47  districts  (1.2 \nmillion people) are classified as \u201cpoorest.\u201d In the eight northern provinces, 60.7% of all districts are \npoor and 44.3% poorest.  \n \n\nNational Development Plans and Health Policies \n\n                                                 \n5  Bounthom, Dr. Phengdy. September 2005. Country Paper on Maternal and Child Malnutrition in Lao PDR. Vientiane. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n \nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  6th  national  socio-economic  development  plan  (NSEDP6)  (2006\u20132010)  identifies \n8. \nhealth  as  one  of  the  four  priority  sectors  for  development.  The  health  objectives  of  NSEDP6  are \npresented  in  the  main  text  (para.  11).  The  Primary  Health  Care  Policy  (2000)  of  the  Ministry  of \nHealth  (MOH),  directly  addresses  the  MDGs,  and  is  supported  by  policies  such  as  those  for \nreproductive health and soon also nutrition.  \n \n9. \nTo  implement  these  overall  policies  and  plans,  the  MOH  has  developed  the  Health \nDevelopment  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  The  cornerstones  of  the  plan  are  summarized  in  the  main  text \n(para.  13).  Expanding  and  improving  the  primary  health  care  (PHC)  network  has  substantial \nfinancial implications for the Government. The NSEDP6 lays out the Government\u2019s overall strategy \nfor  increased  and  more  efficient  funding  of  the  health sector,  including  better  donor  coordination. \nAnother  health  financing  priority  under  the  plan  is  making  health  services  more  affordable  to  the \npoor by introducing health insurance and health equity funds.  \n \n10. \nThe  National  Reproductive  Health  Policy  (MOH,  October  2005)  proposes  to  integrate \nreproductive health services and widen the scope of safe motherhood services at all levels. In the \narea  of  adolescent  health,  the  policy  emphasizes  the  need  for  school  health  programs  and \ncampaigns  through  mass  organizations  and  media  to  reach  out-of-school  youth.  The  National \nStrategic and Action Plan on HIV/AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006\u20132010) was approved \nin 2005. It proposes a multisectoral response based on the \u201cthree ones\u201d approach of one oversight, \none  program,  and  one  monitoring  system.  Among  the  key  concerns  identified  is  the  limited \ncoverage of the high-risk population. \n \nC. \n \n11. \n The  MOH  is  responsible  for  health,  nutrition,  population,  and  rural  development,  including \nsmall-scale  water  and  sanitation,  and  also  coordinates  multisectoral  programs  such  as  those  for \nHIV/AIDS  and  avian  Influenza  control  and  preparedness.  It  has  seven  departments:  the  cabinet, \nhygiene  and  prevention,  curative,  organization  and  personnel,  planning  and  budgeting,  food  and \ndrugs,  and  inspection.  The  MOH  has  a  National  Steering  Committee  for  Health  that  oversees  all \nMOH activities, including its projects and programs.  \n\nSector Organization  \n\nRegional  hospitals  provide  a  wider  range  of  specialist  services  and  are  also  centers  for \n12. \ntraining  and  technical  supervision.  Under  the  provincial  committee  for  health  of  the  provincial \ngovernment,  the  provincial  health  office  plans,  implements,  supervises,  and  monitors  PHC \nprograms in the province. In each province, a PHC coordination office under the provincial health \nofficer has responsibility for PHC activities.  \n \n13. \nUnder  the  district  health  committee,  the  district  health  office  supervises  services  in  the \ndistrict and the village health program to ensure regular and good-quality service to the population. \nDistrict hospitals have been divided into two levels. Surgeries can be done in type A hospitals but \nnot in type B hospitals.  \n \n14. \nHealth centers have also been divided into types A (large) and B (small). The functions of \nthe health centers are prevention, health promotion, and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases \nwithin their capacity. Like hospitals, health centers manage drug revolving funds to sustain service. \nUnder the supervision of the district health office, the health center supervises and monitors village \nhealthcare providers, and coordinates between village and district.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n29\n\n \n\n \n\nThe village health committee selects and supervises the village health volunteers (VHVs), \n15. \nusually 2\u20133 (male and female) per village, who are trained for 3 months.6 The VHVs mainly provide \nbasic  curative  care  and  run  a  drug  revolving  fund.  Village  health  providers  are  private  providers \nwith some health background. The peer educators are volunteer providers of health and nutrition \neducation  and  promotion.  Trained  birth  attendants,  if  they  are  present,  assist  with  deliveries  and \ngive  advice  on  safe  delivery  practices.  Traditional  healers,  according  to  the  health  policy, \ncomplement  modern  medicine.  All  are  expected  to  promote  the  three  elements  of  good  hygiene \n(clean water and food, body and clothes, and environment).  \n\nPrimary Health Care Delivery \n\n16. \nIn  2001,  there  were  309  registered  private  clinics,  mainly  urban  and  mostly  run  by  public \nhealth  staff  after  office  hours.  There  are  very  few  private  clinics  in  the  eight  northern  provinces. \nMost of those that do exist have only basic equipment. Houaphan and Phongsali provinces have \nno  recorded  private  clinics  at  all.  In  2001,  there  were  2,132  registered  private  pharmacies  in \nLao PDR.  There  are  also  many  unlicensed  drug  shops  and  a  host  of  illicit  private  drug  vendors. \nThe sale of poor-quality and fake drugs, in particular for infections, is a major problem. \n \nD. \n \n17. \nHousehold  access  to  public  health  services  is  around  90%  in  Lao  PDR,  if  VHVs  are \nincluded. In remote areas, where it would be highly inefficient to build fixed health facilities, VHVs \nare  the  only  feasible  source  of  PHC  services  (see  figure).  Their  presence  in  the  villages  has \nparticularly  benefited  ethnic  groups,  as  shown  in  the  chart  below.  The  provision  of  drug  kits  has \ngiven many ethnic villages access to health services within less than 1 hour. However, VHVs need \nmore training, in reproductive health, nutrition promotion, and other areas.  \n \n18. \nA  study  on  the  use  of  health  facilities,  done  during  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  for  the  PHCEP  in  2000,  found  that  expanding  the  health  facility  network  through  the \nconstruction  of  health  centers  in  two  provinces  from  1995  to  2000  had  increased  the  outpatient \nutilization  rate  in  their  administrative  areas  from  16%  to  33%  in  Xiangkhouang,  and  from  8%  to \n27%  in  Oudomxai.7  According  to  the  PHCEP  Household  Survey  in  2004,  rural  households in  the \nhighest  quintile  have  an  inpatient  admission  rate  of  42.4  per  1,000  persons  per  year,  compared \nwith 15.9 for rural households in the lowest quintile. \n \n19. \nThe  quality  of  PHC  services  is  particularly  problematic.  Many  health  workers  cannot \ndiagnose  and  treat  common  diseases  such  as  malaria,  diarrhea,  and  acute  respiratory  infections \naccording to the standards required in Lao PDR. At health facilities only about 20% of children with \ndiarrhea receive adequate treatment and counseling (i.e., continued breast-feeding). Some of this \ninsufficiency  stems  from  a  lack  of  qualified  teachers  with  field  experience  and  familiarity  with \nmodern teaching methods. Many hospitals also lack skilled staff in such areas of health services as \nlaboratory, pharmacy, blood bank, and some medical services. Also, critical shortages in recurrent \nbudgets for public health facilities hamper effective and efficient operation.  \n\n                                                 \n6  Training  modules  for  VHVs  and  village  health  providers  were  developed  in  cooperation  with  the  United  Nations \n\nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) under the PHCEP. \n\n7  Noel,  Alain.  2000.

Strengthening  human  resource  planning,  management, \nand training in the health sector is a priority in achieving this goal. The NSEDP6 assigns top priority \nto increasing the health staff in the villages and districts, and to improving the attitude, morale, and \ncapacity of health personnel. The MOH does not have a comprehensive, strategic human resource \ndevelopment  policy  or  long-term  plan  specific  to  the  health  sector.  The  MOH  Department  of \nOrganization and Personnel is developing a 5-year national Human Resource Plan for the sector, \nbut  it  lacks  experts  and  facilities  in  this  field.  Workforce  planning  is  constrained  by  difficulties  in \ncollecting  reliable  personnel  data.  The  MOH  is  also  pilot-testing  a  human  resource  management \ninformation system and expanding its use. \n \n21. \nAs of March 2005, there were 11,037 active employees in the public health sector, and 484 \nemployees on study leave. In addition to MOH personnel, 5,452 were employed in the military and \npolice services. There are also about 20,107 volunteers or traditional health-care providers, and a \nsmall workforce in the 254 or so private health clinics. Government health personnel are distributed \nas  follows:  central,  19%;  provincial,  33%;  district,  39%;  and  village  or  health  center,  10%.  Staff \ngaps are apparent in health centers and district hospitals, with a third of district hospitals in some \nareas lacking a doctor or staff. There are also significant skill gaps in many provincial hospitals in \nsuch areas as laboratory, pharmacy, blood bank, and some medical services. The mix of staff in \nLao PDR shows a relatively high ratio of doctors to mid-level staff (1 doctor for every 1.7 nurses, \nmidwives, or medical assistants), associated with health system inefficiency.  \n \nThe  unavailability  of  female  staff  and  health  workers  from  small  ethnic  groups  was \n22. \nmentioned  earlier.  The  PHCEP  has  introduced  bridging  training  for  potential  health  staff  from \nremote areas who do not meet the  basic educational requirements. The training of PHC  workers \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n80% \n\n70% \n\n60% \n\n50% \n\n40% \n\n30% \n\n20% \n\n10% \n\n0% \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n31\n\n \n\nHealth Sector Management \n\nhas added some 150 staff at health centers in the eight northern provinces. Revitalizing the training \nfor medical assistants (PHC officers) will make more mid-level staff available at health centers. Low \nsalaries and lack of incentives (financial and nonfinancial) for rural and remote posting hamper the \neffective distribution of staff to health centers and district hospitals. The Government has passed \nlegislation to introduce financial incentives for rural civil servants (Decree No. 381/PM). However, \nwhether such incentives are enough to bring the health staff\u2019s income anywhere near their needs is \nquestionable. \n \n23.  Many  MOH  staff  do  not  perform  at  their  potential  because  of  lack  of  appropriate  skills  or \nmotivation and poor human resource management. Many managers lack the skills and resources \nto properly manage, supervise, and support their staff in performing at a high level. Furthermore, \nfacilities often lack the equipment needed to provide the full range of services that the staff have \nbeen  trained  for.  The  quality  of  training  needs  to  be  improved  to  better  prepare  health  staff  to \ndeliver good-quality services. Teacher trainers will have to be trained in modern teaching methods \nand training institutions adequately equipped with teaching materials. Students should be admitted \non the basis of needs and actual training capacity, including capacity for skills training. \n \nF. \n \n24. \nPrime  Minister  Instruction  No.  01/PM  of  March  2000  established  the  principle  of \ndecentralization  and  the  governance  of  planning  and  budgeting  (see  main  text,  para.  11).  Still, \nresponsibilities and authority at the different levels of health administration are unclear. Provincial \ngovernments  are  often  uncertain  about  their  roles  and  responsibilities  because  implementation \nguidelines  on  decentralization  are  lacking,  e.g.,  for  budgeting  procedures.  The  responsibilities \ndelegated  often  do  not  match  the  human  and  financial  resources  available.  There  is  lack  of \nanalytical  and  managerial  skills  at  all  levels.  Most  provincial  authorities  cannot  prepare  medium-\nterm  (strategic)  and  annual  plans  and  budgets.  The  districts  also  lack  capacity  for  planning  and \nbudgeting.  Moreover,  operating  funds  are  not  enough  to  establish  the  necessary  exchange  of \ninformation and provide the required supervision and services. \n \n25. \nDecentralized and need-based health planning is further impeded by the fragmentation of \nhealth management and service delivery into vertical programs. Each program has its own targets, \nlogistics,  reporting  system,  and  often  its  own  field  workers  and  remuneration  schemes.  The \naforementioned  challenges,  along  with  vested  interests  in  maintaining  control  over  budgets  and \nprograms,  disincline  central  health  authorities  from  delegating  power  to  the  lower  levels  of  the \nhealth  system.  As  a  result,  decentralization  of  authority  is  incomplete  and  the  lower  levels  of  the \nhealth system are not encouraged or empowered to assume their full responsibilities. The shortage \nof  reliable  data  and  funds  for  supervision  also  constrain  the  management  of  PHC  and \ndecentralization. Without timely and accurate data, health managers are hard put to identify critical \nneeds  and  trends,  and  thus  to  plan and  budget appropriately.  Supervision  is seriously  hampered \nby  the  lack  of  operating  funds.  Managers  cannot  properly  supervise  and  support  their  staff.  The \nreasons  for  program  failures  need  to  be  analyzed  and  addressed  urgently.  Strengthening \nmanagerial capacities at all levels of the program will be one answer. Structural changes will also \nbe required: programs should be integrated, and responsibilities delegated properly to lower levels \nwith  the  necessary  authority,  flexibility,  and  accountability  for  decision  making.8  There  must  be \nsubstantial consensus building and indeed a change in the work culture in the coming years.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2006.

In  2002\u20132005,  government  health  spending \nmore or less remained at about 1% of gross domestic product, and about 6% of total government \nexpenditure.  This  is  low  compared  with  government  health  spending  in  many  other  low-  and \nmiddle-income  countries.  The  NGPES  foresees  an  increase  in  the  budgetary  allocation  for  the \nhealth sector. But the Government\u2019s fiscal situation will remain very tight in the next 5\u201310 years.  \n \nThe share of domestically financed government health spending in total health expenditure \n27. \nhas varied considerably over the last 12 years. The share was about 18% in 2002\u20132003. Generous \nforeign  financing  has  kept  the  share  of  government  health  spending  in  total  health  expenditure \nwithin 42\u201351%, implying a high 49\u201358% in out-of-pocket expenditures (Table A1.2).  \n \n\nTable A1.2: Total Health Expenditure, by Financing Source, 1992\u20132003  \n(current $ million) \n\n \n\nFinancing Source \nGovernment (domestically financed) \nCentral Ministry of Health \nProvinces  \nForeign-financed \nDonors \nNongovernment organizations \nHouseholds \nUser fees at public facilities \nOther private expenditure \nTotal Health Expenditure \nTotal Per Capita ($) \nPublic health spending \n\nDomestically financed (%) \nForeign-financed (%) \nHousehold-financed (%) \n\nCalendar Year \n\n1992\u20131993 \n8.40 \n3.33 \n4.95 \n8.61 \n5.36 \n3.25 \n20.68 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n38.18 \n8.54 \n \n22.0 \n22.6 \n54.2 \n\n1994\u20131995 \n16.30 \n6.33 \n9.70 \n8.43 \n7.70 \n0.70 \n26.21 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n50.68 \n11.26 \n \n32.2 \n16.6 \n51.7 \n\n1997\u20131998 \n8.31 \n2.31 \n5.20 \n22.05 \n17.64 \n4.40 \n42.09 \n15.07 \n27.02 \n72.45 \n14.94 \n \n11.5 \n30.4 \n58.1 \n\n1999 \n5.55 \n1.54 \n3.49 \n21.69 \n18.63 \n3.06 \n34.30 \n12.21 \n22.09 \n61.63 \n11.81 \n \n9.0 \n35.2 \n55.7 \n\n2002\u20132003 \n7.09 \n1.89 \n5.22 \n13.05 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n19.02 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n39.17 \n7.38 \n \n18.1 \n33.3 \n48.6 \n\n\u2014 = no data available. \nSource:  Knowles,  J.  2006.  Public  Expenditure  in  the  Lao  PDR  Health  Sector:  ADB,  RSC-C51839  (LAO):  Public \nExpenditure Review. Manila.  \n\n \n28. \nEstimates for 2002/03 indicate that the share of capital spending in total health expenditure \nhad increased sharply since 1999 (i.e., from 20% to 39%), while the share of drugs in total health \nspending  had  decreased  by  about  the  same  amount  (i.e.,  from  55%  to  34%).  The  share  of \npersonnel  expenditure  had  also  declined  (from  18%  to  12%),  while  that  of  other  supplies  had \nincreased  from  7%  to  14%.  Most  of  the  government  spending  is  tied  up  in  salaries,  and \ninfrastructure  development  (e.g.,  counterpart  funds  for  projects).  A  high  share  of  foreign  financial \naid may have created substantial inefficiencies through an excessive focus on investment without \nadjusting  for  recurrent  expenditures.  To  improve  aid  effectiveness,  there  must  be  better  aid \ncoordination and reduced transaction costs, particularly given the limited capacity of the MOH.  \n \n29. \nPublic health-care facilities recover some of their costs through drug revolving funds, which \ninclude income from fees for medicines and supplies consumed. A markup of 25% (usually) on the \npurchase  cost  covers  exemptions  for  poor  patients,  administration  costs,  damage,  spoilage,  etc. \nUntil recently, the facilities were not allowed to charge fees for services provided, other than drugs \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n33\n\n \n\nand supplies, except for some nominal room charges for inpatients. The level of cost recovery in \nthe country\u2019s public hospitals is relatively high compared with that in other countries in the region. \nThe recent Decree on Fees and Charges (PM 381, December 2005), may significantly change the \nway  health  facilities  charge  fees  to  patients  and  finance  staff  salaries,  however.  All  government \nagencies may now charge for all services and products that they provide, and use the revenue thus \ngenerated for salaries and other recurrent costs. But increasing prices risks making public health \ncare  even  less  affordable,  especially  to  the  rural  poor.  Poor  and  near-poor  people  are  either \nexempted from fees or discharged after pledging to pay the fees later, often in installments. Even \nthese  arrangements,  however,  often  compel  them  to  sell  assets  or  to  take  out  private  or \ncommercial loans.  \n \n30. \nThere is substantial evidence that the non-poor receive most of the health sector services. \nEfforts must therefore be made to distribute the services more equitably, as provided in the policy \nstatement of the Government. Among other things, there must be a greater emphasis on benefits \nfor rural communities. The Government is making efforts to make health care more affordable, e.g., \nby improving cost recovery, and promoting community-based health insurance and possibly credit \narrangements  and  equity  subsidy  for  the  very  poor.  There  are  three  formal  health  insurance \nschemes  in  Lao  PDR:  (i)  civil  servant  health  insurance,  (ii)  social  security  organization,  and \n(iii) community-based  health  insurance.  Social  security  organization  and  community-based  health \ninsurance  are  small  programs  for  private  sector  workers  that  cover  only  about  64,000  people \nnationwide\u2014well  less  than  1%  of  the  population.  It  will  take  a  long  time  to  cover  the  informal \nsector, given the current pace, capacity, use of services, and quality of care.9 \n \n31. \nThe  Government  is  also  striving  to  increase  the  use  of  fixed  facilities  and  village-based \nservices  through  health  equity  funds  (HEFs),  among  others.  Three  HEFs  are  now  being \npilot-tested. Each pre-identifies the poorest people in the district and issues health cards to allow \nthem  to  obtain  free  services.  All  three  HEFs  are  relatively  small  efforts  to  support  the  very  poor. \nThe  MOH  has  proposed  a  public  assistance\u2013financed  system  with  HEFs  for  the  poor  and  also  a \nhealth loan fund for the near-poor. Such funds will also give hospitals and health centers a more \nsecure basis for forecasting revenue. By removing the uncertainty of bill payments, they will put the \nhealth facilities in a better position for budgeting. \n \nTable A1.3 summarizes health services data for the eight northern provinces.

The 17 provinces will also be \nsupported in planning and budgeting, to introduce the results-based approach.    \n \n2.  \nThe Project will require five international consultants for a total of 47 person-months, five \nnational consultants for a total of 90 person-months, and architect and accounting services. The \ninternational experts in PHC systems (21 person-months), health policy and planning (6 person-\nmonths)  and  health  economics  (8  person-months)  will  be  hired  as  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for hiring consultants. The architect and accounting services \nwill  be  hired  through  separate  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  using  the  biodata  technical  proposal  and \nconsultant  qualification  selection  or  least-cost  selection  method.  Other  consultants  will  be \ncontracted  through  one  firm  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants, \nusing the fixed budget selection method and biodata technical proposal. This package includes \ninternational experts in HRD (9 person-months) and social development (3 person-months); and \nnational  experts  in  health  information  (24  person-months),  health  policy  and  planning  (12 \nperson-months),  HRD  (24  person-months),  health-care  financing  (24  person-months),  and \nsocial development (6 person-months). \n \n3. \nThe consulting services are designed to provide technical support to the Project as well \nas to build MOH and provincial capacity for planning, management, service delivery, and policy \nanalysis in the sector.

The resettlement framework has been prepared for the Project because the \nfinal  location  of  each  subproject  has  not  been  agreed  yet  and  there  is  no  technical  design \navailable.    The  resettlement  framework  sets  out  the  resettlement  policy,  screening  and  planning \nprocedures  that  the  Project  will  follow  when  preparing  a  resettlement  plan,  if  any  is  required, \nfollowing detailed design.   \n  \nLegal and Policy Framework. The policy framework and entitlements are developed from \n2. \nthe  relevant  laws,  decrees  and  regulations  of  the  Government  of  Lao  PDR  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995)  guided  by  Operations  Manual  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(OM/F2, 2006).  Provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement framework will supplement \nthe  provisions  of  relevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Lao  PDR  wherever  a  gap  exists.    Key \nstrategies  to  reconcile  the  differences  will  be  included  in  the  resettlement  plan  that  will  be \nprepared. \n \nSite  Selection  and  Resettlement  Plan  Preparation.    Site  selection  and  detailed  design \n3. \nwill,  to  the  extent  feasible,  explore  all  viable  options  to  avoid,  if  not,  reduce  the  requirements  for \nland acquisition and resettlement. As a priority, vacant and idle public or communal reserve land \nwill  be  used.  If  private  land  has  to  be  acquired,  criteria  for  acquiring  private  land  to  minimize \nresettlement impacts, procedure for the resettlement plan preparation, and project entitlements are \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix D.  Voluntary contributions of land or other assets will not be \npermitted. \n \nParticipation and Grievance Redress. Consultation will be undertaken prior to finalization \n4. \nof  detailed  design  in  order  that  affected  persons\u2019  requests  and  suggestions  to  minimize \nresettlement  impacts  can  be  incorporated  into  the  design  as  far  as  is  practicable.  Separate \nconsultations with poor and vulnerable groups will be carried out in order to identify and address \nthe  specific  needs  or  concerns  of  these  groups.  A  grievance  mechanism  will  be  established  to \nensure that affected persons\u2019 concerns and grievances are addressed and resolved in a timely and \nsatisfactory manner. Affected persons will be made fully aware of their rights verbally and in writing \nduring consultation, survey, and time of compensation.  \n \n5. \nImplementation  Arrangements.  At  the  central  level,  the  project  office  of  the  Ministry  of \nHealth will provide overall guidance and technical support to the provincial and district resettlement \ncommittees (RCs). The project office and RCs will be assisted by the Supervision Consultants. A \ndomestic  resettlement  specialist  will  provide  full-time  assistance  during  resettlement  preparation \nand implementation. Village Resettlement Committees will be established, as required. \n \n6. \nMonitoring, Budget, and Implementation Schedule. The project office will be responsible \nfor  internal  monitoring  of  resettlement.  Progress  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly \nbasis.    The  budget  will  cover  compensation  for  land  acquisition  and  rehabilitation  costs, \nmanagement  costs,  and  contingency.    All  resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil \nworks  schedule.    Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  not  approve  award  of  civil  works  contract \nuntil  all  resettlement  activities  has  been  satisfactorily  completed  and  agreed  rehabilitation \nassistance is in place and that the site is free of all encumbrances.  Resettlement implementation \ncannot commence until the resettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB.   \n \n7. \nDisclosure  of  Resettlement  Planning  and  Monitoring  Documents.  The  draft \nresettlement framework  has been uploaded on ADB  website.  The project office and RCs will  be \nresponsible for the disclosure of the resettlement plan to the APs prior to submission to ADB. ADB \nwill upload the final resettlement plan and resettlement progress reports on ADB\u2019s website. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n \n53\n\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS \n\n \n1. \nThe Project will monitor inputs, activities, outputs, coverage, and impact indicators, as also \ndescribed  in  the  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  in  Appendix  3.  In  addition,  the  Project  will \nsupport social analysis, with emphasis on poverty, gender, and ethnic group issues. \n \n2. \nTo monitor project outcome (output, coverage and impact), the Project will use the primary \nhealth  care  expansion  project  household  survey  and  health  service  survey,  both  scheduled  for \nNovember\u2013December  2006,  as  baselines.  With  project  completion  scheduled  in  2011,  the \nhousehold survey will be repeated in November\u2013December 2010, and the health service survey in \nNovember\u2013December 2008 and 2010. The number of indicators will be kept limited, and standard \ndefinition and survey methods will be used to allow comparison of data. The household survey will \nbe  based  on  the  multi-cluster  model  and  the  sample  size  will  be  large  enough  to  provide \ndisaggregated data by gender and ethnic group for each of the eight provinces where the survey \nwill be conducted. The health facility survey will include all hospitals and a sample of health centers \nand village health volunteers. \n \n3. \nThe Project will use a detailed chart to help prepare, plan, and coordinate project activities, \nand assess physical progress. This chart will also be used for tracking inputs. Detailed monitoring \nof staff and financial inputs using financial management tools will be used to track costs, so as to \nbe able to calculate unit costs, which will be useful for future contracting. \n \n4. \nIn addition, qualitative studies will be conducted, in particular in the area of health services \nmanagement,  planning  and  budgeting,  financial  management,  the  program-based  approach, \nhealth equity funds, and financial studies.  \n \n5. \nThe outcome indicators (impact, coverage and output) in the table have been prepared in \ncoordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  to  measure  sector  achievement  in  relation  to  project \nobjectives  toward  the  overall  achievement  of  relevant  millennium  development  goals.  The \nindicators will be disaggregated by sex, poverty level, ethnic group, and place of residence, where \npossible.  \n \n\nIndicative Performance Indicators \n\n  \nClassification \n \nChild survival \n\nIndicator \nImpact and Coveragea \n\n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \nHealth  is  a  key  factor  in  achieving  sustained  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  gender  equality.  The \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies health as a priority in its 6th national socio-\neconomic  development  plan  (NSEDP6,  2006\u20132010)  that  feeds  into  its  poverty  reduction  strategy  outlined  in  the \nNational  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES,  2003).  The  NGPES\u2019s  operational  framework  comprises \nfour  main  sectors:  agriculture,  education,  health,  and  infrastructure.  In  the  health  sector,  the  priorities  include \nstrengthening and improving the quality of health care at the grassroots level, particularly in underserved areas and for \nvulnerable groups, including mothers and children, and small ethnic groups. \n \nThe Health System Development Project is aimed at improving the health and nutrition of the population, in particular \nthe poor,  women and children, and ethnic groups in the  eight northern  provinces of Lao PDR. The objectives of the \nProject are twofold: (i) to improve primary health care (PHC) delivery, in particular for vulnerable groups, in the eight \nnorthern  provinces;  and  (ii)  nationwide,  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  in  health  system \ndevelopment,  including  human  resource  development  (HRD),  planning  and  budgeting,  and  coordination.  It  supports \nthe Health Strategy (up to the year 2020) and its objectives of ensuring full health-care service coverage, justice, and \nequity in order to increase the quality of life of all Lao ethnic groups. It contributes directly to poverty reduction with its \nfocus  on  improving  PHC  for  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  Improved  health  reduces  income  losses  and \nexpenditures due to illness or disease, and indirectly protects the labor force and production of food and cash crops. In \neducation, children in good health and with good nutrition learn faster and miss school less often because of illness. \nThe Project is also aimed at improving access to health care by the poor, the near-poor, women, and vulnerable ethnic \ngroups by introducing health equity funds (HEFs).  \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention-millennium development goals \nThe country has made strong economic gains over the last few years. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was \n$335  in  2000  and  increased  to  $491  in  2005.  Annual  real  GDP  growth  from  2000  to  2004  increased  from  5.8%  to \n6.5%. The International Monetary Fund projects continuing solid growth at 6\u20137% per year in 2006\u20132010. Lao PDR\u2019s \ngrowth  over  the  past  decade  or  more  has  led  to  a  decline  in  overall  poverty,  from  46%  in  1992  to  32%  in  2003.1 \nDevelopment, however, has not been even in geographic distribution and among the various economic sectors. There \nare stark disparities in economic growth between urban and rural areas, and in the income of the \u201cbetter off\u201d and the \npoor.  Lao  PDR  remains  one  of  the  world\u2019s  least-developed  countries,  as  it  ranks  131rd  out  of  177  countries  in  the \nUnited Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) Human Development Report for 2005.2  \n \nThe Project  will be implemented  in the eight northern provinces  of  Xaignabouri, Phongsali, Bokeo, Louang Namtha, \nOudomxai, Louang Phrabang, Xiang Khouang, and Hoauphan,  where there is a large  concentration of poor people. \nWithin  these  provinces,  districts  will  be  selected  in  line  with  the  NGPES  development  priorities  (e.g.,  47  poorest \ndistricts).  In  the  eight  project  provinces,  about  61%  of  all  districts  are  classified  as  poor,  and  44%  poorest,  in \ncomparison with the national level, where about 51% of all districts qualify as poor and 33% as poorest. About 37% of \nthe total population in the northern provinces is from small ethnic groups (PHCEP 2004 Household Survey). Many of \nthem live in remote, mountainous areas, thus making physical access to any services, including health and education, \ndifficult. Village-based health services need to be expanded into these areas. \n \nThe poor often bear the highest burden of illness and disease. Some are unable to use public health facilities because \nof  the  introduction  of  user  fees  and  the  absence  of  social  safety  nets.  The  low  access  to  health  services  for  ethnic \ngroups is exacerbated by sociocultural, language, and traditional health practices. A lack of health facilities and trained \nethnic health staff also affects utilization rates. The Project is focused on expanding PHC services through a network \nof village health workers from the specific ethnic community, and on supporting bridging courses for students who do \nnot  already  meet  the  general  education  prerequisites  for  entry  into  formal  PHC  worker  training  courses  (introduced \nunder  the  primary  health  care  expansion  project).  The  HEFs  will  be  pilot-tested  in  three  provinces  (Xaignabouri, \nXiangkhouang, and Oudomxai) to help protect the poor and near-poor from the risk of further impoverishment due to \nincreased  health-care  spending.  The  HEFs will  give  the  poor  better  access  to  health  services,  especially  access  for \npoor women to obstetric services.  \n\n                                                 \n1  National Statistics Centre of the Lao PDR. 2003.

A variety of stakeholders \nwere consulted including the relevant ministries, other national agencies, provincial and district health officials, managers \nand  staff  of  hospitals  and  health  centers,  village  health  volunteers.  Discussions  were  held  with  development  partners \n(e.g., the World Bank) to ensure synergies and complementarities with their ongoing initiatives in the health sector, and \nwith the private sector (Amanresorts International Private Limited) to seek out possible partnerships.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  participation  strategy  is  incorporated  into  the  overall  project  design.  The  Project  supports  the  MOH  efforts  to \nstrengthen  the  decentralization  of  the  health  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR.  It  will  also  build  MOH\u2019s  capacity  to  coordinate \namong  donors  as  the  health  sector  gradually  moves  toward  a  program  approach.  It  supports  consultation  and \ncoordination activities among departments within MOH, between MOH and other line ministries, between the central \nand administrative levels, and in the districts and villages. The use of participatory approaches is critical for the design \nand introduction of HEFs. Villagers, especially women, will participate in the identification of candidates for PHC officer \ntraining. Health committees at different levels will perform various roles in the management of health facilities and of \nhealth programs, including the expansion of the village health program under the Project. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\nC.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe Project\u2019s PHC focus is highly beneficial to poor women and children. Support for expanding the reproductive health \npackage  including referral services for  obstetric  emergencies  will  benefit  women directly.  Women  will  also benefit from \nproject support to increase nurse-midwives, so that more births can be attended by a trained health worker. The selection \nof health workers to be trained will focus on filling gaps in female staff. Training content will be sensitive to gender and \nethnicity. It will include an emphasis on reproductive health and family planning. Health facility designs will be reviewed to \nensure that they allocate enough room for delivery and postdelivery care, and that the privacy and other needs of women, \nincluding those from small ethnic groups, are reflected. The HEFs supported by the Project will improve women\u2019s access \nto  emergency  obstetric  services.  Health  planning  needs  will  be  based  on  sex-disaggregated  data  and  on  monitoring \nindicators, and data collection methodologies will be reviewed. A gender strategy and action plan is in Appendix 14.  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\nD.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n \n \nItem \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nReplacement  of  11  existing  health  centers  and  upgrading  of \nthree district hospitals under the Project will not require any new \nland. Construction of new provincial hospitals in Houaphan and \nLouang Namtha and 10 new health centers will, as a priority, be \ncarried  out  on  vacant  and  idle  land  owned  by  the  Government \nthat  is  free  from  all  encumbrances,  habitation,  dispute,  or \ncontroversy.  Since  the  final  site  for  each  subproject  has  not \nbeen agreed yet, a resettlement framework has been prepared. \nThe  Project  provides  targeted  support  to  the  poor  and  ethnic \ngroups,  particularly  women  and  adolescent  girls,  to  expand \naccess to health services. HEFs will address access barriers to \nPHC services by the poor and near-poor in three pilot provinces. \nThe Project is not expected to adversely affect labor policy, law, \nor broader labor issues. It will lead to better skilled health staff in \nthe  provinces,  districts,  and  villages.  Interventions  will  help \nincrease  the  number  of  female  and  ethnic  health  workers  and \ncontribute to better retention in remote and underserved areas. \nThe  project  design  is  built  around  the  needs  of  ethnic  groups \nand  includes  several  strategies  to  ensure  that  ethnic  groups \nbenefit from the Project.

It  is  assumed  that  the  Project  will  have  positive  impact  on  the  population\u2019s  health  by \nimproving access to effective and efficient health services, thus reducing the disease burden. The \nuse  of  quantitative  analysis  is  based  on  estimates  of  the  likely  net  present  value  of  the  Project\u2019s \nbenefits in relation to its costs.  \n \n \n \n2. \nSpending  public  resources,  whether  from  the  current  budget  or  through  loan  funding,  is \nsupported  most  strongly  where  resources  are  targeted  to  services  with  substantial  positive \nexternalities\u2014(i)  strengthening  the  ability  of  primary  care  to  deliver  basic  health  services, \n(ii) providing an insurance or social safety net for the most uncertain health services, (iii) increasing \nthe  appropriate  use  of  primary  health  care  (PHC)  services  among  the  poorest  groups,  and  (iv) \npromoting appropriate and effective services. \n \n3. \nThe  strongest  rationale  for  government  involvement  in  the  health  sector  is  its  potential  to \ncontribute to more effective and efficient functioning of the health system and to poverty reduction \nand redistribution of income. Government involvement in the provision of health services, such as \nmalaria  control,  surveillance  and  control  of  communicable  diseases,  sanitation,  mass  education, \nand  research,  is  justified  because  of  their  \u201cpublic  goods\u201d  nature.  Similarly,  many  health  services \ncan create large spillover effects (such as vaccination for preventive health services), and produce \ngreater  social,  rather  than  private,  benefit.  There  is  also  good  reason  for  the  Government  to  be \ninvolved in addressing market failure in the provision of health services to the poor.  \n \n4. \nAlthough  progress  has  been  made  in  recent  years,  health  status  indicators  show  that  the \npopulation  remains  affected  by  significant  health  problems.  Urban-rural  disparities  exist  in  social \nindicators. Infant mortality and maternal mortality continue to be among the highest in the region. \nNotwithstanding the impact of poverty and of the situation in other sectors, public health issues can \nbe  mitigated  with  adequate  financing  and  improved  performance  of  the  health  delivery  system. \nWeaknesses in the health system will continue to hamper improvements in health indicators unless \nthe low and inefficient use of resources, inadequate incentives for service delivery, low capacity of \nservice providers, and core issues of physical and financial access are addressed. \n \nIn  such  a  scenario,  investing  in  health  is  likely  to  generate  substantial  economic  returns. \n5. \nThe Project has been designed to have a systemic effect, supporting both activities that generate \ndirect health benefits for the target population and activities that will affect the planning, financing, \nand  management  of  health  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  creating  the  practical \nconditions  for  the  actual  implementation  of  an  integrated  PHC  package  in  the  villages  while \ndeveloping critical capacity for efficient management of the health system at all levels. The Project \nwill focus on the needs of the poor and vulnerable, by building institutional capacity in the health \nworkforce at all levels; improving the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of health-care financing; \nand improving the delivery and quality of PHC services. Equitable and efficient allocation of scarce \nresources can play an important role in improving the health status of the poor.  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n \n6. \nThe Project is expected to yield several benefits. These include improvements in the health \nof  people  in  the  program  provinces  and  districts  through  increased  health  service  delivery,  more \nefficient  resource  allocation  and  mobilization,  greater  quality  of  care  to  reduce  the  number  of \ntreatments and recurrence of illness, and better access for vulnerable groups.  \n \n7. \nThe Project\u2019s support for PHC will play a key role in decreasing the maternal mortality rate, \ninfant mortality rate, and general morbidity. It relies on the strengths of PHC, which bring essential \nsupport  to  cost-effective  treatment  and  prevention.  Health  staff  will  be  trained  in  clinical  and \nnonclinical  approaches.  The  Project  is  expected  to  increase  the  number  of  persons  receiving \ngood-quality  health  care,  and  will  contribute  directly  to  improving  the  productivity  of  the  target \nbeneficiaries.  \n\n8. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  the  target  beneficiaries,  primarily \nthe poor. It will have several positive impacts on the population\u2019s health and welfare, which can be \nquantified in economic terms. Key project benefits are as follows: (i) cost savings due to improved \naccess  to  efficient  and  effective  health  services,  and  (ii)  increased  income  through  reduced  sick \nleave or time spent caring for the sick. Cost savings may arise from (a) reduced costs of curative \nservices as a result of improved access to prevention and health promotion services; (b) reduced \nout-of-pocket expenditures, mainly transport cost due to improved access to health services; and \n(c)  more  efficient  and  rational  diagnosis  and  treatment  that  reduce  treatment  cost.  Adults  often \nhave  to  care  for  sick  children,  or  they  may  contract  infectious  disease  themselves  and  suffer \nreduced  work  productivity  and  foregone  income  through  premature  death.  The  nature  of  these \nproductivity  losses  has  received  limited  attention  in  the  literature,  although  demographic  and \nhousehold  surveys  indicate  that  considerable  time  is  lost  through  the  transportation  and  care  of \nsick family members.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Costs \n\n \n9. \nBase investment costs are in constant 2007 dollar prices. Costs are derived from projected \ndisbursements over the implementation period and are adjusted for inflation into 2007 dollar terms. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  based  on  the  period  of  20  years,  the  expected  life  of  the \nProject.  Incremental  recurrent  costs  are  calculated  for  the  16  years  following  the  4-year  project \nimplementation period. \n \n\n4. \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis \n\n \n10. \nKey assumptions are: \n\nThe quantitative cost-benefit analysis for the Project follows the methods outlined by ADB.1 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nDiscount rate. The economic opportunity cost of capital was assumed to be 12%. \nMost health project analyses tend to use 3% as a discount factor. Therefore, future \nbenefits are likely to be given greater value. To harmonize this analysis with other \nproject appraisal in non-health sectors, a higher discount rate is used. \n \nProjection of project benefits and costs. The period of analysis covers 20 years, \nand  benefits  and  costs  are  calculated  in  constant  2007  dollar  prices.  Key  benefits \nincorporated  in  the  economic  evaluation  framework  involve  cost  savings  from \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

The opportunity cost of labor or the shadow wage for both \nurban and rural adults was calculated at $0.5 per day. This estimate is derived from \nbasic statistics on the Lao PDR. \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n11. \nThe Project will avoid the loss of nearly $23 million in income from workdays lost to illness \nor  spent  caring  for  the  sick,  and  save  $57  million  in  out-of-pocket  health  expenditure  over  the \n20-year  project  period.  The  analysis  assumes  that  a  10%  reduction  in  the  under-5  mortality  rate \nwould  yield  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  17.7%.  A  net  benefit-cost  ratio  of  1.35  is \ncalculated. Cost savings from reduced medical expenditure is expected to account for 71% of total \neconomic benefits, and labor productivity for 29%.  \n \nB. \n \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\n \n12. \nLao  PDR  has  shown  robust  and  rising  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth,  averaging \nmore  than  6%  from  2000-2005.  The  robust  growth  is  largely  attributable  to  the  industry  sector, \nparticularly  the  development  of  gold  and  copper  mining  and  the  Nam  Theun  2  Hydroelectric \nProject, which registered double-digit growth in recent years.2 The economy is forecast to grow by   \n6\u20137%  in  2006  to  2010,3  with  the  energy  sector  as  the  key  engine  of  economic  growth  over  the \nperiod.  \n\n \n\n13. \nThe  Government  made  progress  in  strengthening  its  revenue  base  in  2004.  Revenue \ncollection, excluding grants, is estimated to have increased 12% in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, \ncentral government expenditure declined from 18.4% in 2000 to 16.7% in 2004, but overall fiscal \ndeficit  narrowed  from  6%  to  4.8%  during  the  same  period.  Efforts  were  made  to  address  an \nimbalance  in  public  expenditure,  reflected  in  an  increase  in  recurrent  expenditures  (wages, \ntransfers, interest payments) from 7.8% of GDP in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n\nThe  sustainability  of  the  health-care  system  remains  a  major  concern of  the  Government. \n14. \nLao PDR is unusual among Asian countries with private (household) expenditures accounting for \nthe  largest  share  (49%)  of  health  spending  in  2000.  The  Government  contributes  about  18%  to \ntotal  health  care,  and  development  partners  account  for  the  remaining  33%  of  the  total.  The \ncomposition of health spending indicates that the Government does not have enough resources to \nsustain  the  health  sector  on  its  own.  The  total  spending  of  about  $11  per  person  per  year,  and \npublic spending of $3 per capita, is well below the target of $34 per person per year on health care \nrecommended by the World Health Organization. \n\n15. \nAlthough  its  resources  for  health  are  severely  limited  by  its  narrow  revenue  bases,  the \nGovernment  is  making  efforts  to  increase  domestic  health  spending  through  fiscal  management \nreforms.  Additional  domestic  resources  of  about  $5  million  per  year  are  projected  for  the  health \nsector  from  2010.  The  positive  economic  prospects,  including  stronger  baseline  growth  and \nimproved cash flow from Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project revenue, are expected to increase the \noverall resources allocated to the health sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB\u2019s draft macroeconomic assessment for the 2007 Asian Development Outlook. \n3  ADB. 2006.

It is designed \nto enhance the quality and management of systems and thus improve health service efficiency and \nquality. The Project will help put PHC facilities into operation through support for recurrent costs to \nimprove  the  operating  efficiency  of  the  health  facilities.  The  Project\u2019s  support  for  village  health \nvolunteers and health equity funds are considered a core strategy to improve the health of the poor \nand, hence, reduce poverty. This strategy should substantially increase the flow of funds for PHC \nand  improve  quality.  However,  recurrent  costs  are  also  expected  to  increase  substantially  on \nproject  completion.  While  this  increase  is  desirable,  given  the  current  low  levels  of  spending,  it \nneeds  to  be  sustainable.  To  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  after  project  completion,  the \nanalysis  focuses  on  the  fiscal  impact  of  the  Project  on  overall  government  and  health  sector \nbudgets.  \n \n17. \nAbout  13%  of  the  Project  will  rely  on  counterpart  funding  from  both  cash  and  noncash \nsources.  The  total  financial  cost  of  the  Project,  inclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  and  contingencies,  is \nestimated at $15.0 million. Of the total project cost, ADB will provide $13.0 million in grant financing \nand the Government will contribute $2.0 million through cash and in-kind contributions. Nearly 75% \nof the Project will go to capital expenses; the remaining 25% will cover recurrent costs.  \n\nGiven  the  expected  project  disbursements,  projections  were  made  to  assess  the  annual \n18. \nrecurrent costs resulting from the Project. The total recurrent costs of the Project are estimated to \nbe about $3.6 million during the implementation period. The incremental recurrent costs associated \nwith  the  Project  are  estimated  at  $0.98  million  per  year  after  project  completion.  The  table \nsummarizes the main recurrent costs of the Project.  \n\nEstimated Recurrent Costs after Project Completion \n($ \u2019000) \n \n\nCategory \nRecurrent costs for primary health care \nHealth equity fund for the poor  \nNew primary health care staff \nVillage drug kits and peer education \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n   Cost \n336.0 \n330.0 \n75.2 \n238.0 \n979.2 \n\n19. \nThe  overall  budgetary  allocation  for  the  health  sector  is  expected  to  increase  from  $29 \nmillion  in  2006  to  $50  million  in  2010.  This  increase  of  $21  million  will  be  more  than  enough  to \ncover the recurrent costs introduced by the Project. If current trends are assumed to continue, the \nhealth sector budget can be expected to grow progressively over the next 5\u201310 years. The Project \nwill have limited impact on central budgetary resources (health), as these represent an average of \nabout 2.2% of the government health budget in the project years. Local spending for health must \nbe  increased  during  project  implementation  to  sustain  and  deepen  the  benefits  and  make  a \nsubstantial impact on key health indicators.  \n\nThe Ministry of Health has confirmed that it has the support for these additional recurrent \n20. \ncosts.  It  intends  to  reduce  rural-urban  discrepancies  and  improve  equity.  It  agrees  that  overall \nrecurrent expenditures are very low, and need to be increased in accordance with the Ministry of \nHealth  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  and  the  corresponding  budget,  and  it  is  containing \ninvestment  in  civil  works,  integrating  services,  and  involving  the  private  sector.  The  result  is \nsubstantial savings, including future recurrent cost savings.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n61\n\nGENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN \n\n \n \n1. \nThe  Health  System  Development  Project  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao \nPDR) is aimed at improving the health and nutrition status of the Lao people, in particular the poor, \nwomen  and  children,  and  ethnic  groups.  It  will  improve  health  and  nutrition  behavior  and  use  of \nhealth  services  by  making  the  provincial  health  system  more  effective,  efficient,  equitable,  and \nsustainable  in  delivering  primary  health  care  (PHC).  The  Project  will  provide  direct  investment  to \nsupport  improvements  in  PHC  in  eight  northern  provinces,  which  were  supported  by  the  Primary \nHealth  Care  Expansion  Project.  These  provinces  are  Xaignabouri,  Phongsali,  Bokeo,  Louang \nNamtha,  Oudomxai,  Louang  Phrabang,  Xiang  Khouang,  and  Houaphan.  In  these  provinces, \ndistricts will be selected according to the development priorities outlined in the National Growth and \nPoverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES)  and  the  6th  national  socio-economic  development  plan \n(NSEDP6)  for  2006\u20132010.  Health  equity  funds  (HEFs)  will  be  pilot-tested  in  Xaignabouri, \nXiangkhouang, and Oudomxai.  \n \nThe  gender  strategy  and  action  plan  (GSAP)  highlights  specific  actions  in  the  Project  that \n2. \nmake it more responsive to the PHC and nutritional needs of women and ethnic groups. The GSAP \nis  based  on  (i)  a  gender  and  social  analysis;  (ii)  primary  and  secondary  data  collection;  and \n(iii) discussions  with  ethnic  people,  women,  government  officials  and  mass  organizations.  The \nGSAP follows Lao PDR regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and Policy on \nGender  and  Development  (2003),  and  the  ADB  document,  Lao  PDR:  Gender,  Poverty  and  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).1 \n \nA. \n \n3. \nAccording to the 2005 population census, Lao PDR has a total population of 5.6 million is \nspread  over  17  provinces,  141  districts,  and  10,552  villages,  with  75  villages  per  district  and  91 \nhouseholds  per  village  on  average.  The  2005  census  identified  49  ethnic  groups,  many  of  which \nlive  in  isolated  villages.  A  large  proportion  of  these  ethnic  groups  live  in  poverty,  and  often  lack \naccess  to  basic  services  and  markets.  Levels  of  education  are  generally  low  in  rural  areas, \nparticularly  among  girls  from  ethnic  groups.  The  individual  health  and  well-being  of  both  women \nand  men  is  fundamental  to  creating  a  foundation  for  sustainable  development.  Poor  health  limits \nearning capacity, productivity, and the ability to seize opportunities. Its impact on women is greater, \nas the next generation is affected. Investment in women\u2019s health has not only individual and family \nbenefits but also generational benefits. \n \n4. \nGender  equality  and  health  care  are  strongly  interrelated.  For  example,  women  and  girls \nmay  suffer  from  nutritional  deficiency  because  of  unequal  allocation  of  food  within  the  family. \nSimilarly, women are often victims of gender-based violence. They are also more vulnerable and at \na  higher  risk  of  acquiring  a  sexually  transmitted  infection  and  HIV/AIDS  because  of  their  young \nreproductive system and limited power to make decisions and negotiate safer sex. Ethnic women \nand girls are more vulnerable because of traditional gender norms and poverty.  \n \nThe  MDG  target  for  reducing  maternal  mortality  is  185  per  100,000  live  births.  Maternal \n5. \nmortality has declined since 1995, from 656 per 100,000 live births to an assumed 400 per 100,000 \nin  2005.  According  to  the  Lao  Reproductive  Health  Survey  2000,  76%  of  women  who  gave  birth \n\nGender Considerations in Primary Health Care \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Only 23% of deliveries were attended \nby trained health personnel. The survey also found that, nationwide, 86% of deliveries, and 9 out of \n10 maternal deaths, occurred at home. Emergency obstetrical care is lacking in some districts, and \neven  when  it  is  available,  the  often  prohibitive  costs  of  transport  and  operations  limit  access. \nContraceptives are still not widely used. The Lao Reproductive Health Survey 2000 found that the \ncontraceptive prevalence rate among married women was 31.6%, while the unmet need for family \nplanning was 39.5%. Overall, a more comprehensive approach is needed to improve obstetric care \nfrom the community level to hospitals, with attention to the following key interventions: (i) measures \nreferral  of \nfor \naddressing  unmet  demand \npregnancy-related  complications,  (iii)  delivery  and  puerperium \nthe  communities,  and \n(iv) increased availability and affordability of emergency services.  \n \nIn  response  to  women\u2019s  particular  health  risks,  constraints  on  women\u2019s  access  to  health \n6. \nservices,  and  patterns  of  women\u2019s  health-seeking  behavior,  newly  designed  health  programs  are \nable  to  deliver  better-quality  health  services  for  women.  For  instance,  women\u2019s  health-seeking \nbehavior and fertility decisions are often influenced by crosscutting factors such as gender relations, \ncultural and traditional practices, ethnicity, and access.2 In the rural and underserved areas, obstetric \nemergency services are available at only a few hospitals because of a shortage in trained staff and \nequipment  in  rural  hospitals.  A  majority  of  women  also  deliver  without  the  help  of  a  trained  birth \nattendant. It was found that Lao women prefer female health care providers, who are in short supply.  \n \n7. \nConventional  access  barriers  to  PHC  services  are  greater  for  women  from  small  ethnic \ngroups  because  of  the  language  barrier,  cultural  differences,  traditional  health  beliefs,  lack  of \nethnic health personnel, and other factors. At the same time, keeping trained health staff in remote \nand rural areas is a challenge, given the low demand for ethnic-specific health services at public \nhealth  facilities,  lack  of  incentive  for  health  workers  to  reside  in  ethnic  villages  because  of \nperceived or real communication gaps, and lack of trained health professionals from ethnic groups \ndue to their comparatively lower educational attainments. Concerted efforts are needed to train and \nkeep health workers from the ethnic groups within their own villages.  \n \nB. \n \nPromoting  gender  equality  is  an  important  national  goal  of  the  Lao  PDR,  as  reflected  in  the \n8. \n1991  Constitution,  the  NGPES  and  NSEDP6,  and  a  number  of  the  country\u2019s  international \ncommitments.  For  example,  the  International  Conference  on  Population  Development  (1994),  the \nConvention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination  against  Women,  and  the  Beijing \nPlatform of Action (1995) are valuable references in formulating gender-responsive health policies. \nThe Government\u2019s recent policy on reproductive health (November 2005) is also a good guide for \nfuture  policies  and  regulations,  as  it  includes:  (i)  family  planning  at  the  village  level,  (ii)  improved \nmaternal  care  at  all  levels,  and  (iii)  training  of  midwives  and  surgeons.  In  addition,  the  Health \nDevelopment  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  emphasizes  the  need  to  increase  the  number  of  female  health \nworkers and health workers from small ethnic groups. In 2004, the Ministry of Health (MOH) set up \nthe  Committee  for  Women\u2019s  Advancement  (Sub-CAW)  to  encourage  and  oversee  the  gender \nmainstreaming  process  and  gender  equity  in  the  health  sector.  The  Sub-CAW  is  led  by  a  vice \nminister and has seven members from key ministerial departments. \n\nCommitments to Gender Equality and Health Care \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2001.

The  Project  gives  particular  focus  to  addressing \nmaternal  and  neonatal  care  through  targeted  local  interventions.  Village  health  volunteers, \nparamedics, and other local health workers will be trained to function as trained birth attendants to \nhelp (i) identify pregnant women; (ii) educate them about pregnancy, nutrition, delivery, and danger \nsigns; (iii) assist with routine deliveries; (iv) refer obstetric complications to referral hospitals; and \n(v)  advise  on  postpartum  and  newborn  care  and  family  planning.  Obstetric  emergencies  may  be \nsupported by village health emergency funds for the poor, established with HEFs. Improved access \nto emergency obstetric care will also be provided through an increase in the number of midwives at \nhealth  centers  and  the  provision  of  ambulances  and  hospital  emergency  room  equipment.  In  the \nvillages, the Project is also aimed at expanding reproductive health services and the village health \nprogram, and setting up health funds. \n \n10. \nGender and Ethnic Awareness and Skills Development. A gender awareness workshop \nshould  be  organized  to  introduce  the  concept  and  advocacy  of  gender  equality  for  poverty \nreduction and health improvement. The gender workshop should be developed for health officials \nand  professionals  (e.g.,  senior  management  officials,  planners,  and  project  managers).  At  the \ncentral  and  provincial  levels,  the  training  curriculum  should  include  topics  related  to  gender  and \ndevelopment,  gender  analysis,  sex-disaggregated  statistics,  gender  empowerment,  and  skills  in \ngender  planning  and  mainstreaming.  A  more  practical  workshop  should  be  organized  for  district \nhealth officials and PHC workers. The workshop should include a session on cultural sensitivities, \nbalance between modern and traditional medicine, and ethnic diversity. \n \nHuman  Resource  Development.  Human  resource  strategies  have  a  dual  internal/external \n11. \nfunction  in  relation  to  gender  mainstreaming.  Internally,  the  organization  should  practice  and  model \ngender  equality  on its own internal  functioning  (e.g., a  hiring policy with  gender  balance, as  well as \nethnic sensitivity). A gender and ethnic perspective should be well integrated into the development of \na 5-year human resource plan for the health sector. As a prerequisite, sex-disaggregated data on the \ncurrent  health  workforce  need  to  be  collected  and  the  database  on  health  personnel  must  be \nimproved. Externally, the health sector needs to contribute more effectively to greater gender equality \nin  its  programs  and  envisaged  impacts  (e.g.,  by  making  commitment  and  competence  to  work  for \ngender equality part of job descriptions, terms of reference, and performance criteria, including those \nfor international and national health consultants). Staff recruitment, promotion, budgetary allocations, \nimplementation of state regulations regarding female employees, and the performance of managers in \npromoting  gender  equality  initiatives  should  be  reflected  in  the  human  resource  plan,  which  should \ninclude steps for diversifying the ethnic composition of the PHC staff. \n \n12. \nGender-Responsive  Planning  and  Budgeting.  Gender-responsive  budgeting  entails  an \nanalysis of any form of public expenditure or method of raising revenue in view of the implications \nfor women and girls, as compared with men and boys. It includes ways in which (i) gender is taken \ninto  account  in  policy  formulation,  implementation,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  priorities  are  given  to \nreducing  gender  inequality;  and  (iii)  specific  targets  for  gender  equality  are  met.  This  type  of \nbudgeting would therefore require the strengthening of health statistics disaggregated by sex. Most \nhealth  institutions  in  Lao  PDR  record  the  gender  and  ethnicity  of  their  clients,  but  do  not  require \ndata  disaggregated  by  sex  for  reporting  to  MOH.  In  most  cases,  the  nature  of  service  often \nprecludes  the  need  to  disaggregate  health  indicators  and  statistics.  Therefore,  to  enable \nmanagers, planners, and policy makers to identify issues and monitor progress, it is recommended \nthat statistics in regular health information systems include sex-disaggregated information. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nHealth-Care Financing. The HEF is a policy decision on health financing. It is suggested \n13. \nthat an assessment be conducted to better identify possible constraints on access for women and \nsmall ethnic groups, and seek ways to formulate appropriate procedures during the pilot stage in \nXaignabouri province.  \n \n14. \nThese  strategic  principles  can  be  translated  into  the  following  specific  actions,  which \ncorrespond to each project component (see table). The Gender Action Plan may be refined during \nimplementation to respond to the specific characteristics of each province and its population. \n\n \nGender Action Plan \n \n\nHSDP Component \n\nProposed Actions \n\nComponent 1: Improving Primary Health Care (PHC) Delivery in Eight Northern Provinces \n1.1. Improving PHC \nmanagement and \nquality of care  \n \n\nrepresenting an ethnic group in the area.  \nIdentify and replicate factors in the PHC workers training approach (2002) that increased female \nhealth staff, especially from small ethnic groups. Make improvements as needed. \n\n\u2022  Work  to  increase  female  health  staff  to  50%  in  rural  health  centers  and  place  at  least  one  staff \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Subsequently,  reserve  a  proportion  of  scholarships  for  the  PHC  worker  training  program  for \n\nqualified female staff. \n\n\u2022  Within the Project, provide the same incentives to male and female health staff. Health staff will \n\nnot be discriminated against as a result of their sex or ethnicity. \nIn improving the PHC management guidelines for the provinces, districts, and health centers that \nwere developed under the PHCEP, give attention to ensuring that maternal health programs are \nwell integrated into the overall comprehensive approach. \n\n\u2022  Make  qualified  female  district  health  managers  eligible  to  participate  in  the  in-service  training  of \n\ndistrict health managers for certificates in PHC management. \nIncludes  separate  sessions  and  on-the-job  training  in  maternal  care  and  barriers  to  access  for \nwomen and ethnic groups (e.g., traditional medicine) in support for the regional school in Louang \nPhrabang (e.g., curriculum, training of teachers, and course implementation). \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Consider  safety  measures  in  the  construction  and  management  of  the  school  and  hostel  in \n\nLouang Phrabang. \n\nschool. \n\n\u2022  Make  qualified  women  eligible  for  stipends  offered  to  those  attending  the  Louang  Phrabang \n\n\u2022  Set aside for women at least 40% of the slots in-service training for health center managers and \n\ndistrict/health center staff. \nIncorporate the health needs of women and ethnic groups in training materials and case studies.  \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Give equal consideration to qualified female district health officers, especially from ethnic groups, \nfor  scholarships,  with  a  target  of  awarding  at  least  30%  of  regional  scholarships  to  qualified \nwomen.  \nInclude  in  the  training  of  midwives  an  understanding  of  the  barriers  to  female  ethnic  mothers  in \nfacility-based deliveries, as well as possible solutions (e.g., incentives for peer referrals). \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Set aside for women at least 35% of village health volunteer positions (new and old) and 50% of \npeer educator positions. Volunteers and peer educators should be ethnically representative of the \nvillage. \nInclude  a  session  on  improving  client-staff  relations  and  using  a  client-centered  approach  in \ntraining for hospital staff in emergency obstetric care. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Allocate  enough  room  in  new/upgraded  hospitals  and  health  centers  for  delivery  and  postdelivery \ncare. The privacy needs of women, especially from small ethnic groups, should be included in the \ndesign. \n\n\u2022  See to it that women make up at least 30% of provincial and district health committees, and are \n\nproportionately represented on committee boards. \n\n\u2022  Highlight  the  range  of  services  especially  for  women  and  ethnic  groups  with  low  literacy  and \n\nlimited access to information, in the reproductive health (RH) package. \n\n\u2022  Disseminate  culturally  appropriate \n\ninformation  about \n\nthe  expansion  of  services,  using \n\ncommunication strategies that are appropriate for different population groups. \n\n\u2022  Explore  the  possibility  of  providing  hardship  allowances  for  specialists  in  district  hospitals  and \n\nfemale staff in health centers, to manage maternal deaths better.  \n\n1.2. Increasing \naccess to PHC, in \nparticular for women \nand ethnic groups \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n \n65\n\nHSDP Component \n\n1.3 Increasing PHC \nfinancing and \naffordability for the \npoor \n\nProposed Actions \n\n\u2022  Equip district hospitals (types A and B) to provide emergency obstetric care. \n\u2022  Give equal benefits from fee exemptions for the same services to men and women. \n\u2022 \n\nIn  pilot-testing  the  HEF,  disaggregate  the  baseline  by  sex  and  ethnicity  for  the  specific  services \ncovered. Progress reports will include information on different beneficiary groups.  \n\nComponent 2: Strengthening Capacity for Health System Development \n2.1.Strengthening \ncapacity for HRD  \n\nInclude training in gender-inclusive recruitment and HRD in the capacity-building activities of the \nDepartment of Organization and Personnel. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Ensure  that  HR  policy,  planning,  and  management  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels  address \nshortages  of  female  and  ethnic  staff  and  students,  including  issues  of  staff  retention  (among \nfemale, ethnic, and other health staff) in remote areas (e.g., incentives).  \n\n\u2022  Consult  existing  health  staff  and  clients  to  understand  the  key  barriers  to  staff  recruitment  and \n\nretention.  \nIn  the  national  survey  of  health  staff,  include  data  on  the  current  health  workforce  needs, \ndisaggregated by sex and ethnicity. \nImprove  the  human  resource  management  information  system  to  include  gender-specific  health \ninformation and sex-disaggregated personnel information. \n\n\u2022  Set HRD targets for every health center, PHC center (type A), and district hospital to ensure that \neach level of health services is adequately representative of the client population and includes at \nleast one female health staff. \n\n\u2022  Support  mechanisms  to  enable  an  increase  in  female  high  school  graduates  participating  in \n\ntraining sessions for health workers (e.g., scholarships). \nIn  managerial  training  in  HR  management,  include  a  session  in  (i)  gender  awareness  and \nmainstreaming, and (ii) cultural sensitivities in delivering good-quality PHC. \n\n\u2022  Consult women and ethnic groups (including, for example, Lao Women\u2019s Union members and the \n\nLao Front) in planning, implementing, and monitoring provincial health plans. \nTrain  provincial/district  health  staff  in  gender-responsive  health  planning,  budgeting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation.  \n\n\u2022  Maximize  training  opportunities  for  qualified  women  in  planning  and  budgeting  within  the  17 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nprovinces targeted under this subcomponent. \n\n\u2022  As part of the guidelines developed for the preparation of 5-year medium-term expenditure plans, \nprepare modules to mainstream gender and pro-poor considerations in a decentralized planning \nand budgeting system for PHC.  \n\n\u2022  Review  5-year  plans  and  expenditure  frameworks  for  the  pilot  province  from  a  gender  and \nethnically sensitive point of view and recommend measures to strengthen these plans. Pro-poor \nhealth  service  coverage  indicators  should  be  disaggregated  by  sex  and  ethnicity  to  the  extent \npossible. \nInclude in health financing studies (e.g., on the effectiveness of HEF) an assessment of (i) gender \nand ethnic needs, and (ii) the impact of recommended interventions on these groups.  \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022  Disaggregate survey questions where appropriate, and administer these to both men and women \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nfrom different ethnic groups. \nIdentify  a  focal  person  in  the  Department  of  Planning  and  Budgeting  to  be  responsible  for \nmainstreaming gender in planning and budgeting.  \nIdentify a focal person in the provincial health office through the PHC coordinating unit to oversee \ngender mainstreaming in planning and budgeting. \n\n\u2022  Provide training in gender-responsive and pro-poor planning and budgeting for the PCU, the PHC \ncoordinating  unit,  the  health  financing  division,  and  other  relevant  health  staff  in  the  target \nprovinces. Recruit a local consultant or MOH staff in the PCU to oversee GSAP implementation. \n\n\u2022  Consult relevant staff, including other stakeholders (e.g., Lao Women\u2019s Union and Lao Front), on \n\nways of improving decentralized planning and budgeting. \n\u2022 \nIncorporate gender aspects of planning and budgeting into materials for strengthening capacity. \n\u2022  Disaggregate  baseline  data  for  monitoring  by  sex  and  ethnicity,  and  include  in  reports  specific \n\nsections on the progress of gender and ethnic activities/actions. \n\n2.2.

A  gender  focal  point  (or  health  staff)  will  be  assigned  responsibility  in  key \nproject  administration  units  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  to  oversee  GSAP \nimplementation.  Representatives  from  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  the  Lao  Front  for  National \nConstruction  will  facilitate  the  participation  of  girls/women  and  ethnic  groups  in  project  activities. \nConsultants will help integrate ethnic and gender concerns into activities during implementation. An \ninternational  social  development  expert  (3  person-months)  and  a  national  social  development \nexpert (6 person-months) will be recruited to work with MOH and other experts. They will work with \nthe  project  coordinating  unit  to  establish  indicators  for  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation, disaggregated by sex and ethnicity. Progress reports will include updates on the effect \nof  the  Project  on  gender  and  ethnicity,  and  the  midterm  review  will  consider  past  updates  and \nmake  adjustments,  as  required.  The  project  completion  report  will  provide  an  assessment  of  the \neffect of project activities in improving the health status of women, ethnic groups, and the poor.  \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 May 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \u2013 kip (KN) \n", "KN1.00 = $.00010412 \n$1.00 = KN9,604.5 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAIDS \nDOP \nDPB \nDRF \nEA \nGDP \nGSAP \nHEF \nHIV \nHRD \nLao PDR \nMDG \nMMR \nMOF \nMOH \nNSEDP6 \nPHC \nPHCEP \nPHO \nRC \nSOE \nVHV \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome \nDepartment of Organization and Personnel \nDepartment of Planning and Budgeting \ndrug revolving fund \nexecuting agency \ngross domestic product \ngender strategy and action plan \nhealth equity fund \nhuman immunodeficiency virus \nhuman resource development \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nmillennium development goal \nmaternal mortality ratio \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Health \nsixth national socio-economic development plan \nprimary health care \nprimary health care expansion project \nprovincial health office \nresettlement committee \nstatement of expenditure \nvillage health volunteer \n", " \nNOTE \n", "In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n", "Vice President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n", "C.
