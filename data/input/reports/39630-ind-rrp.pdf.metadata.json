This policy, Power for \nAll  by  2012,  will  require  additional  generation  capacity  of  78,600 \nmegawatts  (MW)  during  the  period  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FY2008\u2013FY2012).  \n\nThe Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) adopted by the Government in \n2006  specifies  certain  regulatory  measures  for  (i)  optimizing  the \npower  supply  mix  through  greater  use  of  indigenous  hydropower \nresources  and  renewable  energy,  (ii)  pursuing  technologies  that \nmaximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing the ongoing power \nreforms  to  control  technical  and  commercial  losses.  In  particular, \nthe IEP aims to change the current hydro-thermal energy ratio of \n25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not \nless  than  10%  of  the  generation  base  by  2012.  The  nationwide \nenergy efficiency potential (including cogeneration) is estimated at \nover  20,000  MW,  but  the  realization  of  this  potential  will  require \nrobust regulatory incentives on behalf of the Government.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  energy  sector  program \nfor  India  aims  at  enhancing  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s \nincludes  both  demand-  and  supply-related \ninitiatives  and \nprograms.  The  planned  activities  include  (i)  renovation  and \nmodernization  of  existing  hydropower  and  thermal  power  plants, \n(ii)  upgrade  of  inefficient  thermal  power  plants  to  enhance  their \nperformance,  (iii)  development  of  renewable  and  alternative \nenergy sources, (iv) reduction of technical and commercial losses \nin  transmission  and  distribution  networks  and  facilities,  and  (v) \nbringing demand-side management and energy conservation into \nthe  mainstream  while  ensuring  environmental  and  social \nsustainability. The recently launched ADB Carbon Market Initiative\nand  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  will  leverage  additional  resources \n\nBorrower \n \nGuarantor  \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nOverview \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto  accelerate  the  promotion  of  energy  efficiency,  renewable \nenergy,  and    other    forms  of  clean  energy  in  India.  As  natural \nenergy  resources  are  unevenly  distributed  and  often  located  far \nfrom  the  load  centers,  the  additional  generation  capacity  will \nrequire  the  development  of  an  adequate  intrastate  and  interstate \ntransmission  system  to  ensure  reliable  and  secure  delivery  of \npower from generation plants to end users. The Central Electricity \nAuthority  (CEA)  has  developed  the  National  Electricity  Plan,  and \nthis is to be used as a basis of investment plans to be prepared by \nprospective  generating  companies  and \ntransmission  and \ndistribution licensees at the central and state level. \n \nPower Transmission Sector. The Indian power system is divided \ninto  five  regions\u2014northern,  southern,  western,  eastern,  and \nnortheastern. Except for the eastern and northeastern regions, all \nthe  regions  are  presently  facing  power  shortages  in  the  range  of \nthe  generation  addition \nabout  300\u20136,000  MW.  Considering \nprogram  up  to  FY2012,  the  maximum  surplus  power  in  the \neastern  region  is  expected  to  be  around  12,000  MW  and  in  the \nnortheastern  region  around  3,000  MW;  however,  the  northern, \nwestern, and southern regions will need to import power to a large \nextent  from  the  northeastern  and  eastern  regions  to  reduce  their \ndeficit  situation.  Therefore,  development  of  strong  interregional \nlinks connecting the northeastern and eastern regions to all other \nregions is needed.  \n \nWhile  the  state  governments  are  responsible  for  the  intrastate \ntransmission system, the Government is focusing on the creation \nof  a  national  grid  in  a  phased  manner  by  adding  over  60,000 \ncircuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission network by 2012. This will \nenable  the  integrated  grid  to  transmit  an  additional  78,600  MW \nand carry 60% of the power generated in the country, increasing \ninterregional  power  transfer  capacity  from  14,100  MW  in  March \n2007  to  more  than  37,000  MW.  For  this  purpose,  capital \ninvestment of about $18.75 billion will be required during the 11th \nFive-Year  Plan  to  (i)  strengthen  regional  grids,  (ii)  increase \ninterregional  capacity,  and  (iii)  establish  a  unified  load  dispatch \nscheme. \n \nPower Grid Corporation of India Ltd. Power Grid Corporation of \nIndia  Ltd  (POWERGRID),  the  central  transmission  utility  tasked \nwith  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining \nthe  national \ntransmission  grid,  will  be  responsible  for  investing  $13.75  billion \nduring the plan period. The balance of $5 billion is expected from \nthe  private  sector.  To  achieve  its  mission,  POWERGRID  has \ndeveloped  a  long-term  corporate  strategic  plan  for  the  period \n2003\u20132012.  The  strategy  covers  various  areas  including  (i) \ncontract management, (ii) project implementation and monitoring, \n(iii)  operation  and  maintenance,  (iv)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards, \ntechnology \ndevelopment,  (vi)  information  technology,  (vii)  human  resource \n\ngovernance, \n\ncorporate \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n\fSector Road Map and \nInvestment Program \nDescription \n\n \n\niii\n\ninitiatives \n\nfar,  23  state  electricity \n\nimplementing  capacity-development \n\nmanagement,  (viii)  cost  reduction,  (ix)  fund  mobilization,  and  (x) \nbusiness process reengineering. While POWERGRID already has \nsufficient  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  strategy,  it  has \nbeen \nincluding \ntraining  programs  for  executives,  managers,  and  line  workers  in \nspecialized  areas.  The  capacity-development  program  is  being \nfinanced through internal resources. \n \nPolicy  Environment.  The  Electricity  Act  2003  provides  a \ncomplete legal framework for implementing the reforms, including \n(i)  the  unbundling  of  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs),  (ii)  the \nestablishment  of  state  regulators,  (iii)  licensing,  and  (iv)  an \nregulatory \nantitheft  provision.  So \ncommissions  have  been  constituted  and  16  states  have \nunbundled and or corporatized their SEBs. The Electricity Act also \nrepresents  a  departure  from  the  previous  regime  of  the  power \nsector by introducing more competition into the wholesale market \nin  addition  to  retail  markets.  Certain  provisions  in  the  Electricity \nAct,  such  as  (i)  open  access  to  the  transmission  and  distribution \nnetwork, (ii) recognition of power trading as a distinct activity, and \n(iii) the liberal definition of a captive generating plant, have already \nstarted  to  introduce  and  encourage  competition  in  the  power \nsector.  Under  the  Electricity  Act,  18  states  have  issued  open-\naccess guidelines. \n \nTransmission  Sector  Road  Map.  The 11th Five-Year Plan aims \nto further accelerate the reforms and underpins the Government\u2019s \nmission  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  through  (i)  expanding  the \ncoverage,  (ii)  improving  the  reliability,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the \nsustainability and efficiency of the interstate transmission network. \nExpected outcomes and major milestones of the plan are defined \nin  the  transmission  sector  road  map.  The  sector  road  map \nincludes specific technical targets to be achieved by 2012 in terms \nof  expansion  of  the  national  power  grid  and  reliability  and \nefficiency  of  the  grid  operations.  As  POWERGRID  is  the  primary \nprovider  of  interstate  and  interregional  transmission  services,  the \nsector  road  map  also  includes  various  measures  based  on  its \nlong-term corporate strategy to further strengthen POWERGRID\u2019s \ninstitutional  capacity  to  achieve  the  technical  targets.  These \nmeasures  aim  to  strengthen  corporate  governance,  improve \nefficiencies,  and  enhance  financial  viability  of  POWERGRID \nthrough  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  safeguard  compliance,  (iii) \nhuman resource management, (iv) information technology, and (v) \ncost reduction. \n \nInvestment  Program.  The  proposed  investment  program  is  part \nof  the  $13.75  billion  investment  plan  of  POWERGRID  and  will \nprimarily  have \nfunding.  Project  1 \n(Upgradation  of  Transmission  Capacity  from  Uttarakhand)  will \nprovide transmission arrangement for the evacuation and reliable \ntransfer of hydropower generated in the Tehri Valley in the state of \n\ntwo  projects \n\nfor  ADB \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nVoltage  Direct  Current \n\nUttarakhand  to  the  northern  region.  Project  2  (\u00b1800  kilovolt  [kV] \nHigh \n[HVDC]  Northeastern\u2013\nNorthern/Western  Interconnector)  aims  to  deliver  bulk  power \ngenerated from hydropower stations in the northeastern region to \nthe power-deficit areas of the northern and western regions. Other \nprojects may be added, if necessary. \n \nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \nabout $2.542 billion including taxes, duties, and interest and other \ncharges  on  the  loans  during  construction.  POWERGRID  has \nrequested  financing  of  up  to  the  equivalent  of  $600  million  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources under the sovereign-guaranteed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  POWERGRID  has  also \nrequested a $400 million nonsovereign loan.  \n \n\nClean  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency.  Projects  1  and  2  under \nthe  proposed  investment  program  will  improve  the  overall  power \nsystem  efficiency  in  the  northern  and  western  regions  by \nestablishing  adequate  high-efficiency  transmission  infrastructure \nwith a planned transmission capacity enhancement of 4,500 MW. \nThe  efficiency  improvements  will  result  from  upgrading  the \ntransmission  network  in  Uttarakhand  and  the  use  of  \u00b1800  HVDC \ntechnology  for  transmission  of  bulk  power  over  a  long  distance \n(1,800  kilometers  [km])  within  the  northeastern\u2013northern/western \ninterconnecting corridor.  \n \nThe  huge  advantage  of  the  HVDC  technology  is  its  ability  to \ntransmit  large  amounts  of  power  over  long  distances  with  much \nlower  technical  losses  than  alternating  current  (AC)  systems. \nLosses in HVDC lines are quoted at as low as 3% per 1,000 km. \nBy  2012,  upon  the  completion  of  two  associated  hydropower \nfacilities  with  a  combined  capacity of  2,600  MW,  the  reduction  in \ntransmission  losses  alone  will  bring  about  228  gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)  of  clean  electricity  transmitted  annually  through  the \nnortheastern\u2013northern/western  interconnecting  corridor.  In  2015, \nwhen  extra  hydropower  capacity  of  3,000  MW  comes  online,  the \nreduced  transmission  losses  will  result  in  491  GWh  of  additional \nelectrical energy per year. In addition, the planned HVDC link will \nnot  only  transmit  excess  electricity  from  the  northeastern  grid  to \nthe  capacity-deficient  northern  and  western  grids,  but  also  make \npossible  the  realization  of  supply-side  energy  efficiency,  which  is \nnot  achievable  in  the  case  of  conventional  AC  transmission \nsystems.  The  efficiency  gains  come  from  the  ability  of  HVDC \nsystems  to  allow  a  quick  change  in  the  direction  of  power  flow \n(bidirectionality).  This  will  permit  (i)  the  meeting  of  peak-load \nneeds  and  provision  of  emergency  power  into  the  northern  and \nwestern  grids  when  fossil-fuel  plants  go  offline  unexpectedly \n(peak-shaving  load  management),  and  (ii)  storage  of  off-peak \npower  from  thermal  facilities  which  are  not  easily  cycled  (valley-\nfilling load management). \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nthe  ordinary  operations \n\nThe  proposed  investment  program  also  will  generate  substantial \nenvironmental  benefits  relating  to  the  reduction  of  greenhouse \ngases  and  other  pollutants.  The  projects  planned  under  the \ninvestment  program  will  allow  avoiding  the  expansion  of  thermal \npower  generation  in  the  Northern  and  Western  regions  through \nenabling  the  transmission  of  hydropower  from  the  Northeastern \nregion of India. ADB estimates that hydropower plants associated \nwith  Project  1  will  offset  more  than  263  million  tons  (t)  of  CO2 \nequivalent,  and  with  Project  2  the  figure  is  551  million  t. \nFurthermore,  additional  cumulative  offsets  gained  from  reduced \ntransmission losses will account for 7 million (t) of CO2 equivalent \nover the lifetime of the project. \n \nThe financing will be provided under the MFF, in accordance with \nADB  policy.1 The  MFF  will  extend  multiple  loans  of  no  less  than \n$100  million  to  finance  part  of  the  costs  of  the  two  projects \nconstituting  the  investment  program.  Additional  projects  may  be \nadded if necessary. These will be subject to submission of related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  by  POWERGRID  and  India, \nand execution of the related loan and guarantee agreements.  \n \nThe  provisions  of \nloan  regulations \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending  facility  will  apply  to  each loan,  subject  to  modifications,  if \nany,  that  might  be  included  under  each  loan  agreement.  The \nspecific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility.  \n \nThe investment program will (i) provide long-term and predictable \nfinancing  for  POWERGRID\u2019s  huge  investment  requirements;  (ii) \nreduce 821 million t of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalent emissions \nover  the  lifetime  of  two  proposed  projects  primarily  by  replacing \nthermal  generation  at  the  demand  site  with  transmitted,  clean \nhydropower;  (iii)  help  POWERGRID  implement  its  capacity-\ndevelopment program under the corporate strategic plan; (iv) help \nPOWERGRID  prepare  for  external  commercial  borrowing  to \nbroaden and deepen its access to financial markets; (v) introduce \nbest  practices,  such  as  state-of-the-art  HVDC \ntransmission \ntechnologies;  and  (vi)  ensure  sound  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies are followed. \n \nThe investment program is expected to promote sustained social \nand  economic  prosperity  and  growth  in  India  by  providing \nadequate  and  reliable  power  supply.  Inadequate  supply  of \nelectricity has been a major hindrance to economic growth in the \ncountry, affecting all consumer groups and social classes. \n \n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005.

Reliable  power  supply  through  the  expansion  and \naugmentation  of  the  national  transmission  grid  will  remove  the \nhindrance  to  economic  growth  in  India  caused  by  an  unstable \nelectricity supply. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  also  help  reduce  821  million  t2 of \nCO2-equivalent  emissions,  primarily  by \nthermal \ngeneration  at  demand  sites  with \ntransmitted,  nonpolluting \nhydropower. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  help  enhance  the  commercial \nviability  of  POWERGRID  by  providing  long-term  funding  support \nfor its immediate investments and promoting various measures to \nstrengthen  corporate  governance  and \nimprove  operational \nefficiencies. \n \nthe  Government  will  remain \nKey  assumptions  are \ncommitted  to  power  sector  reforms  and  development  of  the \nnational  electricity  market,  (ii)  the  Electricity  Act  2003  will  be \nimplemented  in  a  timely  and  transparent  manner,  and  (iii) \nmacroeconomic growth will remain stable. \n \nPOWERGRID  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  from  SEBs,  which \nessentially handle retail distribution of electricity in India. While the \ncost-plus  tariff  structure  in  India  allows  all  debt  servicing,  foreign \nexchange  losses,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  to  be \npassed on, there may be a possibility of reduction in the return on \nequity  guaranteed  to  POWERGRID.  These  risks  may  impact  on \nthe  cash  flow  of  POWERGRID  and  implementation  of  the \ninvestment program. However, such risks appear to be low given \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  strong  financial  position  and  stringent  payment \ndiscipline for SEBs introduced in 2003.  \n \n\nreplacing \n\nthat  (i) \n\n\f \n\nix\n\nOther  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  (i)  delay  in \nassociated generation investments, (ii) an increase in the price of \nmaterials,  and  (iii)  failure  to  meet  safeguard  requirements  in  a \ntimely  manner.  These  risks  all  appear  to  be  low.  The  investment \nprogram  is  properly  planned  and  sequenced  with  regard  to  the \nassociated  generation  plan,  and  the  implementation  of  the \nassociated  hydropower  generation  plants  is  on  track.  Sensitivity \nanalyses  of  the  investment  program  indicate  that  it  is  resilient  to \nincreases  in  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  technical  capability  to  implement  the  investment \nprogram  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies is well proven. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (the Facility) to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (POWERGRID), \nguaranteed  by  India,  for  the  National  Power  Grid  Development  Investment  Program.  The  design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nSector Overview \n\nfluctuation  at  metered  consumer \n\n \n2. \nBalanced  infrastructure  development  is  a  major  challenge  for  India  to  overcome  if  it  is  to \nachieve  its  sustainable  economic  growth  target  of  8\u20139%  annually  over  the  next  25  years.  Given \ninfrastructure  inadequacies  now  exist  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas,  preliminary  exercises  by  the \nGovernment  of  India  indicate  that  investment  in  infrastructure  will  need  to  increase  from  4.6%  of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  between  7%  and  8%  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  period. \nDevelopment  needs  in  the  power  sector  are  vast;  India\u2019s  need  for  power  is  growing  rapidly  with \nconsumption  increasing  by  about  64%  over  the  last  10  years.  The  forecast  growth  in  electricity \ndemand to support a GDP growth rate of about 9% is expected to be 8%. This is higher than the \nlast  10  years,  as  the  energy-intensive  manufacturing  sector  is  expected  to  increase  its  share  of \nGDP.  However,  electricity  is  still  inaccessible  to  the  majority  of  households.  While  over  80%  of \nvillages are already electrified, only 44% of total households have access to electricity, and in the \nrural  areas  only  33%  of  households  have  access  to  electricity.  As  of  31  March  2005,  per  capita \nelectricity consumption stood at about 606 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually.  \n  \n3. \nEnergy  and  peaking  shortage  are  high,  with  frequent  load  shedding  (rationing)  and \nindustrial \nsignificant  voltage \ncompetitiveness  and  severely  constrains  economic  growth.  The  major  reasons  for  inadequate, \nerratic,  and  unreliable  power  supply  especially  at  the    state  level  are  (i)  inadequate  power \ngeneration  capacity,  (ii)  lack  of  optimum  utilization  of  the  existing  generation  capacity,  (iii)  an \ninadequate and aging subtransmission and distribution network, (iv) large scale theft and a skewed \ntariff structure, (v) slow pace of rural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity by the end \nconsumer. \n \nIn  India,  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  [AT&C]  losses  are  quite  high  arising  mainly \n4. \nfrom  distribution  losses,  unmetered  connections,  theft,  and  subsidies  to  agricultural  consumers. \nNationwide AT&C losses amount to as much as 40%, compared to the world average of 10\u201315%, \nwhile some states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat have shown remarkable \nimprovement  in  reducing  AT&C  losses.  The  operational  inefficiencies  represented  by  such  high \nAT&C  losses,  combined  with  retail  tariffs  set  far  below  the  cost  of  supply,  have  resulted  in  a \ndeterioration  of  the  financial  health  of  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs).  Despite  the  Government\u2019s \nefforts to create enabling and encouraging policy and regulatory framework, poor creditworthiness \nof SEB remains a major hindrance to private sector investment in some states.  \n \n5. \nIn  line  with  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act  1998,  the  Central  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (CERC) was established in 1998, and has full authority to determine bulk \ntariffs. The 1998 act enables state governments to establish state electricity regulatory commissions \nwith  jurisdiction  over  state  power  utilities.  CERC  regulates  interstate,  regional,  and  interregional \ntransmission, while the 23 state electricity regulatory commissions regulate state transmission and \n\nlevels.  This  undermines \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ndistribution. State and central regulatory commissions have powers to (i) grant, amend, and revoke \nlicenses; (ii) regulate the performance of licensees; (iii) determine tariffs; (iv) safeguard consumers' \ninterests while ensuring cost recovery of electricity; (v) promote development of markets, including \ntrading; and (vi) rationalize electricity tariffs by making subsidies transparent. \n \n6. \nTo further accelerate the sector reforms, the Government enacted the Electricity Act 2003, \nwhich came into force in June 2003. The Electricity Act provides for a complete legal framework for \nimplementing  the  reforms,  including  (i)  the  unbundling  of  SEBs,  (ii)  establishment  of  the  state \nregulator,  (iii)  licensing,  and  (iv)  an  anti-theft  provision.  The  Act  also  represents  a  departure  from \nthe previous power sector regime by introducing more competition into wholesale as well as retail \nmarkets. Certain provisions in the Electricity Act, such as (i) open access to the transmission and \ndistribution  network,  (ii)  recognition  of  power  trading  as  a  distinct  activity,  and  (iii)  the  liberal \ndefinition of a captive generating plant, are expected to introduce and encourage competition in the \npower sector. Under the Electricity Act, 18 states have issued open-access guidelines. \n \n \n \n7. \nCognizant  of  the  pivotal  role  the  power  sector  plays  in  development  for  economic  growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  confirmed  its  mission  to  provide  electricity  to  all \nhouseholds at an affordable price by 2012. This goal of Power for All by 2012 has been elaborated \ninto  subsector-specific  policies  in  the  National  Electricity  Policy,  which  was  prepared  in  February \n2005 in accordance with the Electricity Act 2003. The Government has set ambitious energy policy \nobjectives to achieve annual generation capacity of 1,000 kWh per capita by 2012. The magnitude \nof investment needed to achieve this goal is vast. Net capacity addition of 78,600 megawatts (MW) \nwill be required under the 11th Five-Year Plan period.  \n\nSector Strategy and Policy \n\n2. \n\n 8. \nIntegrated Energy Policy. The Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) adopted by the Government \nin  2006  specifies  certain  regulatory  measures  for  (i)  optimizing  the  power  supply  mix  through \ngreater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy, (ii) pursuing technologies \nthat maximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing the ongoing power reforms to control technical \nand  commercial  losses.  The  Government  is  endeavoring  to  turn  the  IEP  targets  into  tangible \noutcomes through the provision of incentives for investors in order to overcome such challenges as \n(i) the perceived advantages of capital investment in everyday technology, (ii) smaller project sizes \nresulting  in  higher  transaction  costs  of  project  preparation,  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  institutional \ncapacities.  In  particular,  the  IEP  aims  to  change  the  hydro-thermal  energy  ratio  from  the  current \n25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not less than 10% of the generation \nbase, by 2012. The nationwide energy efficiency potential (including cogeneration) is estimated at \nover  20,000  MW,  but  the  realization  of  this  potential  will  require  robust  regulatory  incentives  from \nthe Government.  \n    \nGeneration. Coal fuel will continue to dominate power production in India in the near future, \n9. \nas the country attempts to increase its generation capacity to keep up with growing industrial and \nresidential power demand. India will continue to emphasize the development of large-scale pithead \ncoal-fired  plants  to  take  advantage  of  domestic  coal  resources  rather  than  increase  fossil-fuel \nenergy  imports.  However,  the  Government  is  endeavoring  to  minimize  environmental  impacts  by \nusing state-of-the-art technologies and continuing the development of clean and renewable sources \nof energy such as the untapped hydropower potential in the northeastern and northern regions.  \n\nThe  thermal-hydro  ratio  was  close  to  50:50  in  the  early  1960s,  partly  because  the  early \n10. \neconomic  development  policy  emphasized  support  for  agriculture,  which  has  extensive  irrigation \ndemands. Industrial development became a priority in the 1960s, when new thermal plants became \ndominant. By 2003, for a variety of reasons, the Government recognized the need to increase the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\nhydropower  proportion  and  introduced  an  initiative  to  develop  up  to  about  50,000  MW  of  new \nhydropower  capacity  as  part  of  the  Power  for  All  by  2012  policy.  The  Ministry  of  Power  (MOP) \nconducted  preliminary  feasibility  studies  on  about  300  candidate  sites,  and  identified  over  30,000 \nMW of potential hydropower that could be commercially developed (based on an estimated 1st-year \ntariff  of  Rs.  2  per  kWh  or  less).  MOP  has  implemented  several  policy  measures  to  accelerate \nhydropower development, including the streamlining of the project approval process and a review of \ntariff policies.  \n\nTransmission. As natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and often located far \n11. \nfrom  the  load  centers,  additional  generation  capacity  will  require  development  of  an  adequate \nintrastate and interstate transmission system to ensure reliable and secure delivery of power. The \nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) has developed the National Electricity Plan, which is to be used \nas  a  basis  for  investment  plans  to  be  prepared  by  prospective  generating  companies  and \ntransmission  and  distribution  licensees  at  the  central  and  state  level.  In  line  with  the  plan, \nPOWERGRID  is  tasked  to  develop  the  national  power  grid  to  provide  adequate  infrastructure  for \ninterstate transmission of power so as to ensure that underutilized generation capacity is used and \nthe  power  is  transmitted  to  deficit  regions.  The  transmission  sector  can  play  a  pivotal  role  in \nimplementing the IEP by (i) ensuring regional energy security with a transnational grid, enabling the \nregion  to  avoid  overdependence  on  fossil-fuel  energy  resources;  (ii)  reducing  greenhouse  gas \nemissions by connecting hydropower and renewable energy power plants to the load centers; and \n(iii) enhancing energy efficiency through technical loss reduction using advanced technologies.  \n \n12. \nDistribution.  The major weakness of the power sector is on the distribution side, which is \nentirely  the  domain  of  the  states.  Restoring  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector  through  the \nrestructure  of  the  state  utilities  (while  still  safeguarding  consumer  interests)  is  a  major  challenge. \nConsequently, the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program (APDRP) was initiated in \n2001 to introduce reforms at the distribution level with an overall objective of reducing AT&C losses \nto 15% by 2007. While metering on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders has improved from 81% in 2001 to 96% \nin  2006,  and  consumer  metering  has  improved  from  78%  to  92%  in  the  same  period,  average \nAT&C losses are still close to 50%, which the Government aims to reduce to 15% by the end of the \n11th  Five-Year  Plan  period.  In  addition  to  financial  support  under  the  APDRP,  many  states  have \nunbundled  their  SEBs  to  put  distribution  companies  under  regulatory  oversight  for  efficiency \nimprovements.  The  Government  encourages  private  sector  participation  in  distribution  through \nprivatization and franchising. \n \n \n \n13. \nPOWERGRID was established in October 1989 and became fully operational in 1992. It is \nresponsible  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  national  transmission  grid,  which \nincludes  interstate  and  interregional  transmission  lines.  Prior  to  its  formation,  central  sector \ngenerating  companies  constructed  and  operated  their  own  transmission  facilities  to  supply  and \ndistribute power from their power plants. As a result, the national transmission system has evolved \nin  a  rather  haphazard  manner,  resulting  in  transmission  bottlenecks  in  many  areas;  most  regions \nare not fully synchronized with each other and there are limited transfers of power. \n \n14. \nAs of December 2007, POWERGRID operates and maintains one of the largest extra-high \nvoltage transmission networks in the world, with about 65,000 circuit kilometers (ckm) of extra-high \nvoltage  lines,  along  with  110  substations  with  transmission  capacity  of  about  66,000  megavolt-\namperes (MVA) and carries about 45% of generated power across the country through its national \ntransmission  grid.  The  national  grid  has  an  interregional  capacity  of  17,000  MW  as  of  December \n2007, which is planned to be increased to more than 37,000 MW by the end of 2012. POWERGRID \n\nPower Grid Corporation of India, Limited \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nowns  and  operates  five  state-of-the-art  regional  load  dispatch  centers  and  is  implementing  the \nNational Load Dispatch Center to integrate them. \n \n15. \nPOWERGRID  has  achieved  remarkable  growth  since  it  started  commercial  operations  in \n1992 and has demonstrated high productivity among major transmission companies in the world. Its \nsystem availability was above 99% in FY2007 and technical loss level is reported at 3\u20134%, which is \ncomparable  with  international  standards.  POWERGRID  played  a  major  role  in  implementing  the \navailability-based tariffs in the country, which helped stabilize vital grid parameters such as voltage \nand  frequency  to  prevent  tripping.  POWERGRID  has  also  invested  in  modernizing  regional  load \ndispatch  centers,  which  has  also  improved  operating  efficiency  of  the  transmission  system. \nPOWERGRID  has  developed  into  a  well-respected  public  sector  enterprise,  which  attracts  highly \nqualified staff who are employing international standards of design, engineering, construction, and \noperations. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges and Opportunities of the Power Transmission Sector \n\n \n16. \nPrior  to  1992  when  POWERGRID  became  fully  operational,  central  sector  generating \ncompanies constructed and operated the transmission facilities to distribute power from their power \nplants  and  transmit  it  to  client  SEBs.  At  that  time,  the  generation  and  transmission  system  in  the \ncountry  was  planned  and  developed  on  the  basis  of  regional  self-sufficiency.  Interregional \ntransmission arrangements were envisaged only for transfer of intermittent operational surpluses of \nsmall  magnitude.  With  the  formation  of  strong  regional  grid  systems,  the  focus  was  shifted  to \nplanning on an all-India basis and for a free flow of electricity across the whole country through a \nstrong national power grid. \n \n17. \nThe Indian power system is divided into five electrical regions\u2014northern, southern, western, \neastern,  and  northeastern.  Except  for  the  eastern  and  northeastern  regions,  all  the  regions  are \npresently facing power shortages in the range of about 300\u20136,000 MW. Considering the generation \naddition program up to FY2012, the maximum surplus power in the eastern region is expected to be \nin  the  range  of  12,000  MW  and  in  the  northeastern  region  around  3,000  MW;  however,  the \nnorthern,  western,  and  southern  regions  will  need  to  import  power  to  a  large  extent  from  the \nnortheastern and eastern regions to alleviate their deficits.  \n \n18. \nThe transmission sector has a great opportunity to enhance energy efficiency and minimize \nenvironmental  impacts,  as  well  as  improve  regional  energy  security,  by  developing  advanced \nnational and transnational grids with cutting-edge technologies such as high voltage direct current \n(HVDC) for connecting the load centers to hydropower and renewable energy power plants in India \nand neighboring countries. State-of-the-art technology will be needed to transfer power with minimal \nlosses and under right-of-way constraints from the resource-rich northeastern and eastern regions \nto distant load centers in the northern and western regions.  \n \n \n \n19. \nThe  development  agenda  for  the  transmission  sector  is  twofold.  At  the  state  level,  where \nSEBs  are  responsible,  strengthening  and  modernization  of  the  intrastate  transmission  system  is \nimmediately needed to reduce technical losses and enhance reliability of state grids. At the central \nlevel,  where  POWERGRID  is  the    primary  provider  of  transmission  service,  transmission  capacity \nexpansion between states and regions is a major challenge for optimizing the use of the country\u2019s \nenergy  resources,  and  one  which  will  require  enormous  investment.  According  to  the  least-cost \n\nSector Investment and Financing Plan \n\n2. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\ngeneration  expansion  program  and  demand  projection  for  different  regions,  the  northeastern  and \neastern region will be the major power exporter for other regions. Therefore, development of strong \ninterregional  links  interconnecting  the  northeastern  and  eastern  regions  to  all  other  regions  are \nneeded.  By  2012,  the  eastern,  western,  and  northern  regions  will  be  interconnected  by  a  high \ncapacity 765 kV ring, while the southern region will remain interconnected in asynchronous mode. \nThe  northeastern  region  is  also  expected  to  be  connected  with  the  eastern  region  by  a  high-\ncapacity 400kV alternating current (AC) link and with the northern and western regions by a high-\ncapacity  800kV  high  voltage  direct  current  (HVDC)  link.  This  will  constitute  a  stronger  national \npower grid with high-capacity transmission. \n \n20. \nAt the central level, the Government, therefore, is focusing on the creation of a national grid \nin  a  phased  manner  by  adding  over  60,000  ckm  of  transmission  network  by  2012  so  that  the \nintegrated grid can handle an additional 78,600 MW and carry 60% of the power generated in the \ncountry,  increasing  interregional  power  transfer  capacity  from  14,100  MW  in  March  2007  to  more \nthan 37,000 MW. For this purpose, capital investment of about $18.75 billion will be required during \nthe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  period  to  (i)  strengthen  regional  grids,  (ii)  increase  interregional  capacity, \nand  (iii)  establish  a  unified  load  dispatch  scheme.  Out  of  this,  investment  of  $13.75  billion  will  be \nmade  by  POWERGRID  for  its  own  facilities  and  the  balance  of  $5  billion  will  be  mainly  for \ngeneration-linked  transmission  projects  to  be  constructed  and  owned  either  privately  or  through \npublic-private  partnership.  POWERGRID  may  participate  in  the  projects  jointly  with  private  sector \ninvestors. The investment and financing plan during the 11th Five-Year Plan period is shown in the \nFigure. \n\n11th Five-Year Plan and Financing Plan\n\n(FY2008-FY2012)\n\nInvestment Plan\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nGeneration-Linked Projects\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n    \n12,947\n\nGrid-Strengthening Projects\n\n      \n\n3,637\n\nPOWERGRID \n\nInterregional/Intercountry Link\n\n      \n\n2,022\n\nULDC and Others\n\n         \n\n144\n\nPrivate \nSector \nInvestment \n\nPublic\u2013Private \nPartnership (JV)\n\nIndependent \nTransmission \nCompanies\n\nPublic Sector \nProjects\n\nADB\nForeign Borrowingsa/Supplier's Credit\nBonds / Domestic Loans\nInternal Resources\nof which JV Investment from POWERGRID\n\nAmount\n($ million)\n       \n600\n    \n3,150\n    \n5,875\n    \n4,125\n     \n(107)\n\nPrivate Sector Financing\n\n    \n\n5,000\n\nTotal\n\n    \n\n18,750\n\nTotal\n\n  \n18,750\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JV = joint venture, POWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., ULDC = United Load Dispatch Center.\na Including $400 million nonsovereign loan from ADB and other multilateral and bilateral sources.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n\n \n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation. The Government amended Indian Electricity Laws to enable \n21. \nprivate sector participation in transmission sector. In January 2000, the Government issued detailed \nguidelines. The guidelines envisage two routes for inviting private sector investment. One route is \nthrough  joint  venture  of  central  transmission  utility  /  state  transmission  utility  and  private  sector.  \nThe  first  joint  venture  has  been  established  by  POWERGRID  and  Tata  Power  Company  Ltd  for \n1,200 km of transmission lines associated with the Tala Hydro Electric Power in Bhutan on Build-\nOwn-Operate  Transfer  basis.  The  project  was  successfully  commissioned  in  August  2006.  ADB \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nprovided a loan1 for the project through its private sector window. Several joint-venture projects are \nat  an  advanced  stage  of  selection  of  investors.  The  other  option  is  through  what  is  known  as  an \nindependent  private  transmission  company,  and  this  envisages  100%  private-sector  investment. \nPart  of  a  system  strengthening  project  in  the  western  region  is  being  implemented  in  this  way. \nPOWERGRID plans various joint-venture projects between now and 2012. \n \n22. \nCorporate  Governance.  POWERGRID  is  committed  to  sound  corporate  governance \nprinciples by promoting corporate fairness, transparency, fiduciary responsibility, and accountability \namongst  all  its  stakeholders,  beyond  its  sole  shareholder.  POWERGRID  believes  that  good \ngovernance should entail trusteeship, empowerment, and accountability of the management while \nremaining  responsive  to  Government  policies.  It  is  focused  towards  its  mission  of  \u201cestablishment \nand operation of regional and national power grids to facilitate transfer of power within and across \nthe regions with reliability, security and economy on sound commercial principles.\u201d2 This mission is \ncarried out based on the well-established practices in engineering and design, procurement, project \nmanagement, finance, and human resources, which are being followed in letter and spirit and are \nbeing continually improved upon. \n \n23. \n Because  its  bonds  are  publicly  listed,  POWERGRID  is  required  by  the  Securities  and \nExchange  Board  of  India  to  have  at  least  50%  of  its  board  directors  as  nonexecutive  members. \nPresently, POWERGRID has nine directors \u2014 three executive directors from POWERGRID and six \nnonexecutive directors. Of the six nonexecutive directors, two are government directors appointed \npart-time; the other four are independent directors.  \n \n24. \nTo introduce a further layer of nonexecutive oversight into its corporate governance system, \nPOWERGRID  has  introduced  certain  committees  of  independent  eminent  persons  relating  to  the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards, and (iv) research and development. These committees report directly to the chairman. \nIn order to have better and more focused attention on certain areas, the board has also constituted \nseveral other subcommittees to focus on functional matters such as (i) the award of contracts, (ii) \nfeasibility  reports  and  revised  cost  estimates,  and  (iii)  bonds.  Improvements  suggested  by  the \nexperts are progressively incorporated into POWERGRID\u2019s procedures. POWERGRID is committed \nto  effective  quality  project  management  aligned  to  its  documented  quality  management  system  to \nthe  requirements  of  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (lSO)  9001  1994  (certification \nachieved in July 1995). An integrated management system has been developed by integrating the \nrequirements  of  ISO  9001:2000  (quality  management  system),  ISO  14001:2004  (environmental \nmanagement  system)  and  OHSAS  18001:1999  (occupational  health  and  safety  management \nsystem).3 A summary of governance measures is in Table 1. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

POWERGRID  has  been \nclassified  as  a  mini-ratna  company,  in  which  it  may  make  capital  expenditures  and  investment  in \njoint  ventures  without  Government  approval  up  to  a  certain  threshold.  Like  other  commercially \nviable  state-owned  enterprises,  POWERGRID  enters \ninto  an  annual  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Government.  The  agreement  sets  annual  performance  targets  for  the \nphysical, financial, and dynamic parameters of POWERGRID and gives the Government a baseline \nfor independent monitoring. At the end of each fiscal year, MOP evaluates POWERGRID\u2019s actual \nperformance,  and  it  has  regularly  ranked  in  the  highest  category.  Based  on  such  performance, \nPOWERGRID  has  requested  the  Government  for  navratna  status,  which  would  provide  greater \nmanagerial  and  financial  autonomy.  Such  designation  would  affirm  POWERGRID\u2019s  corporate \ngovernance reforms. The Government  is expected to confer the Navratna status soon. \n \n26. \nInitial  Public  Offering  and  Partial  Divestment  of  Government  Shares.  As  per  the \ndecision  of  the  Cabinet  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  in  November  2006,  the  Government  has \n\n                                                 \n4   A  navratna  company  does  not  require  Government  approval  for  any  investment  and  is  allowed  to  enter  into  a  joint \n\nventure business in India as well as overseas up to certain limit. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\ndecided to issue fresh shares to the public in three public-sector power companies\u2014POWERGRID, \nthe Rural Electrification Corporation, and the Power Finance Corporation\u2014up to 24% of their paid-\nup capital, and to divest itself of 5% of its shares in the companies. POWERGRID invited bids for its \ninitial  public  offering  up  to  10%  of  its  paid-in  capital  between  10  and  13  September  2007.  The \ndivestment  of  the  Government  shares  was  planned  simultaneously.  These  actions  have  diluted \nGovernment  ownership  in  POWERGRID  from  100%  to  about  86.4%.  This  is  a  positive  step  in \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  corporate  governance  reform  program,  as  it  will  encourage  further  disclosure  of \nfinancial information to shareholders, investment professionals, and the general public. Public listing \ncreates regular market information on commercial performance and monitoring by a separate class \nof  shareholders  other  than  the  Government  (this  is  because  shareholders  have  a  residual  rather \nthan  a  priority  claim  on  the  firm\u2019s  assets;  the  value  of  minority  shareholders\u2019  investments  in  the \nutility  compared  with  the  lenders  depends  more  strongly  on  the  performance  of  the  utility). \nPOWERGRID has received enormous response from the bidders in all categories. Massive positive \nmarket  response  to  the  share  issue  reflects  POWERGRID\u2019s  existing  corporate  governance \npractices and demonstrated confidence in the company going forward on a commercial basis \n \n \n \n27. \nThe major development partner in the electricity sector has been the World Bank, which has \nsupported  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including  assistance  directed \nto  SEBs  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  ADB \ncoordinates with the World Bank on the geographic demarcation of state-level operations, as well \nas to ensure the overall complementary nature of actions at both the central and state levels. Other \nmajor  agencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany. Besides these, technical assistance is being provided \nby  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  Although  the \ncombined  assistance  of  all  assistance  agencies  constitutes  only  about  8\u201310%  of  the  total \ninvestments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have resulted.  \n \n28. \nPrevious  ADB  assistance  to  the  power  sector  in  India  is  listed  in  Appendix  4.  Since  1986, \nADB  has  approved  loan  assistance  totaling  about  $3.59  billion5 for  23  energy  sector  projects  in \nIndia. Out of these, three loans among five totaling $925 million were POWERGRID projects. ADB \nhas  also  given  India  37  technical  assistance  grants  totaling  about  $22.5  million,  mainly  for \nassistance on power sector reforms and restructuring at the national and state level. \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \nADB  has  provided  three  loans6 to  POWERGRID,  one  of  which  has  been  post-evaluated.7 \n29. \nRelevant lessons learned are that (i) with proper planning, effective project monitoring mechanisms, \nand motivated and well-trained personnel, infrastructure projects can be implemented successfully \neven  in  difficult  terrain;  and  (ii)  POWERGRID\u2019s  timely  acquisition  of  land  and  other  statutory \nclearances  helped  in  project  implementation.  It  was  also  learned  that  the  project  implemented  by \nPOWERGRID  has  contributed  to  (i)  overall  growth  of  the  power  sector,  (ii)  a  reduction  in \n\n                                                 \n5  Including the amount of approved tranches for the MFF.  \n6  ADB. 1995.

POWERGRID has also \nbeen allowed to award contracts without submitting bid evaluation reports and award proposals to \nADB  for  prior  approval  when  the  contract  amount  is  less  than  $3  million  for  the  lowest  evaluated \nbidder  provided  that  (i)  any  bid  evaluation  cases  raising  unusual  issues  or  problems  shall, \nregardless of contract amount, be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval; and (ii) contracts \nshall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders. This has helped acceleration of procurement. \n \n31. \nAccording  to  the  survey  conducted  for  POWERGRID  in  the  recent  Sector  Assistance \nProgram Evaluation on the Indian power sector, it is pointed out that ADB\u2019s advice on developing its \nenvironmental  standards  and  social  policies  and  on  designing  its  procurement  procedures  has \nassisted  with  POWERGRID\u2019s  institutional  development  and  that  these  factors,  along  with  the \nadditional  credibility  that  POWERGRID  gains  as  an  ADB  client,  are  also  vital  parts  of  the  lending \nrelationship. However, POWERGRID also asserts that ADB attempts to exercise too much control \nover  the  detail  of  POWERGRID  decisions  in  procurement  and  safeguard  matters.  Particularly,  it \nfinds  some  ADB  conditions  irksome;  for  example,  the  request  for  a  resettlement  plan  for  a \ntransmission  line  project  when  it  is  not  the  company\u2019s  policy  to  acquire  land  but  rather  to  pay \ncompensation  for  crop  losses.  Under  the  Facility,  these  concerns  have  been  duly  addressed  by \nproviding  more  autonomy  and  flexibility  to  POWERGRID,  based  on  overall  assessment  of  its \ncapacity in procurement and safeguard measures.  \n \n \n \nCognizant of the strong nexus between infrastructure and poverty reduction, ADB\u2019s overall \n32. \nassistance  has  taken  a  balanced  infrastructure  development  approach,  comprising  road  systems, \nwater  transport,  railways,  hydrocarbons,  and  energy.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  energy  sector  as \noutlined in the 2005 country strategy and program updates9 has six main priorities: (i) reforming the \npower  sector;  (ii)  promoting  higher  efficiency  and  low-carbon  power  sources  (for  example,  run-of-\nriver hydropower projects and renewable energy); (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and \ndistribution systems; (iv) strengthening institutions to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct  2003,  including  the  development  of  more  flexible  power  delivery  and  trading  systems;  (v) \npromoting  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation  and  ensuring \nenvironmental and social sustainability.  \n \n33. \nTo  support  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  Power  for  All  by  2012,  ADB\u2019s  future  strategy  for  the \npower sector will be aligned with the 11th Five-Year Plan. ADB will continue to support state-level \npower  sector  reforms  by  including  more  states,  such  as  Himachal  Pradesh  and  Bihar,  and  by \nincreasing its  efforts  in  the  states  in  which  it  is currently  active,  such  as  Assam,  Gujarat,  Madhya \nPradesh,  and  Uttarakhand.  The  proposed  loan  is  consistent  with  the  strategy  of  supporting \nexpansion  and  optimization  of  the  transmission  network  and  will  also  help  to  promote  the  open-\naccess policy introduced under the Electricity Act 2003. ADB intervention will (i) promote knowledge \ntransfer  in  relation  to  best  practices  in  the  international  power  sector,  (ii)  improve  corporate \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n\n6. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2004.

Inadequate \nsupply  of  electricity  has  been  a  major  hindrance  to  economic  growth  in  the  country,  affecting  all \nconsumer  groups  and  social  classes.  The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  is  enhanced \ntransmission network reliability and efficiency through expansion and augmentation of the national \ntransmission grid. This, in turn, will lead to improved quality of supply in the major demand centers \nof  the  northern  and  western  regions  of  the  country.  Through  the  development  of  a  sophisticated \nnational  grid  to  be  linked  with  neighboring  countries  with  untapped  natural  resources,  the \ninvestment  program  will  also  contribute  to  enhancing  regional  and  national  energy  security  and \nenergy efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The investment program is part of \nthe least-cost development plan for the power sector, and supports the Government\u2019s goal of Power \nfor All by 2012. \n  \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe investment program will have two projects for funding under the Facility.  \n\nProject 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity from Uttarakhand. This project \nis to provide adequate transmission capacity for reliable transfer of power generated \nin  the  Tehri  Valley  in  Uttarakhand  to  constituents  of  the  northern  region,  by  (i) \nestablishment of 765/400 kV, 10 x 500 MVA transformation capacity at Tehri Pooling \nStation and Meerut substations within the existing substation site, (ii) construction of \n103 km of loop-in-loop-out of Bareilly\u2013Mandaula 400 kV double-circuit transmission \nline  at  Meerut  (54km  of  loop-in  and  49km  of  loop-out),  and  (iii)  modification  of  a \nseries  of  capacitors  for  operation  at  765  kV  level.  ADB  funding  is  proposed  for \nsubstations only. \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2004.

This project aims to deliver bulk power generated from hydropower \nstations  in  the  northeastern  region  to  the  power-deficit  areas  of  the  northern  and \nwestern  regions  through  construction  of  about  1,800  km  of  \u00b1800  kV  HVDC \ntransmission systems from Biswanath Chariyali to Agra, including 800 kV converting \nand  inverting  stations  at  both  ends,  and  construction  of  400  kV  connecting \ntransmission  lines  at  Biswanath  Chariyali  for  transfer  of  power  from  various  power \nplants  in  the  northeastern  region.  ADB  funding  is  proposed  for  the  \u00b1800  kV  HVDC \ntransmission lines only.  \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \n37. \nThese  projects  have  been  proposed  for  ADB  funding  due  to  (i)  their  project  readiness,  (ii) \nthe need to dovetail transmission system development with associated generation projects, and (iii) \nthe level of  innovation in introducing state-of-the-art high voltage transmission technology. Project \nreadiness of these projects is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. Other additional projects may \nbe added subsequently if necessary. \n \nC. \n \n38. \nRoad Map. The 11th Five-Year Plan aims to further accelerate the reforms and underpin the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  through  (i)  expanding  coverage,  (ii)  improving \nreliability,  and  (iii)  enhancing  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  the  interstate  transmission  network. \nExpected  outcomes  and  major  milestones  of  the  plan  are  defined  in  the  transmission  sector  road \nmap.  The  sector  road  map  includes  specific  technical  targets  to  be  achieved  by  2012  in  terms  of \nexpansion  of  the  national  power  grid  and  reliability  and  efficiency  of  the  grid  operations.  As \nPOWERGRID is the provider of interstate and interregional transmission services, the sector road \nmap also includes various measures to further  strengthen POWERGRID\u2019s institutional capacity to \nachieve  the  technical  targets,  based  on  its  long-term  corporate  strategy.  These  measures  aim  to \nstrengthen  corporate  governance,  improve  efficiencies,  and  enhance  the  financial  viability  of \nPOWERGRID  through  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  safeguard  compliance,  (iii)  human  resource \nmanagement, (iv) information technology, and (v) cost reduction. The road map provides for a long-\nterm framework of ADB\u2019s intervention in the sector and will be used as a basis for dialogue with the \nGovernment and POWERGRID during the Facility period. Based on the road map, the Facility will \nhelp enhance the commercial viability of POWERGRID by providing long-term funding support for \nits  immediate  investments  and  promoting  various  measures  planned  under  the  road  map  to \nstrengthen corporate governance and improve operational efficiencies. This combined approach will \nensure  the  development  impact  of  the  investment  program.  The  central  transmission  sector \nroadmap is provided in Appendix 3.      \n \n39. \nEnergy  Efficiency  Improvement  and  Emission  Reduction.  The  Facility  will  incorporate \nstate-of-the-art  HVDC  transmission  technology.  HVDC  is  proven  to  be  the  most  cost  effective \nmeans  of  transmitting  bulk  power  over  long  distances,  well  beyond  that  which  is  feasible  using \nconventional AC technology. At 1,000 MW design capacity for point-to-point transmission, HVDC is \neconomically  preferable  for  system  lengths  exceeding  700\u2013800  km,  and  transmission  losses  are \nalso less.   \n \n40. \nThe proposed projects will also improve the overall power system efficiency by connecting \n1,000  MW  pumped  storage  facilities  under  Project  1  and  2,600  MW  hydro  generation  facilities \nunder Project 2 to the northern and western region grids. The projects will reduce energy demand \nat  certain  critical  times,  typically  when  the  regional  electrical  system  experiences  peaks.  It  will \ngenerally  have  only  small  effects  on  overall  energy  use  but  will  focus  sharply  on  reducing  energy \nuse at critical times (peak-shaving load management) and increasing off-peak energy consumption \n\n \n\n\fwithout  necessarily  reducing  peak  demands  (valley-filling  load  management).  The  projects  will \nenable  the  use  of  hydropower  storage  systems  in  the  northeastern  region  to  (i)  meet  peak  load \nneeds as well as provide emergency power injection into the grid when fossil-fuel plants go offline \nunexpectedly,  and  (ii)  store  off-peak  power  generated  from  fossil-fuel  facilities  that  are  not  easily \ncycled.  A  significant  advantage  of  the  connected  pumped  storage  system  is  its  ability  to  rapidly \ninject a large amount of power into the power grid. \n \n41. \nThe  investment  program  does  entail  potential  cumulative  and  induced  impacts,  which  are \nlargely considered positive. POWERGRID will transfer low-carbon energy from hydropower plants \nin the northeastern and northern regions to the other regions which experience power deficit. The \nproposed projects will reduce emissions by replacing thermal generation at demand sites (northern \nand  western  regions)  through  the  transmission  of  clean,  less  polluting  hydropower  generated  in \nphases  from  the  remote  northeastern  region  of  the country  with  negligible  environmental  impacts. \nADB estimates that Project 1 associated hydropower plants will offset more than 8 million tons (t) \nper  year  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent  by  2015,  and  cumulative  offsets  of  more  than  263 \nmillion  t  of  CO2-equivalent  during  the  30-year  project  lifecycle  (based  on  about  2,400  MW  of \nhydropower available for transmission). ADB also estimates that Project 2 is expected to generate \nabout 20 million t in CO2 emission reductions in the first phase (2010\u20132015) with the total amount of \nCO2-equivalent emission reductions reaching 551 million t over the lifetime of the project. Additional \ncumulative offsets gained from the reduction in transmission losses in Project 2 account for 7 million \nt  CO2  equivalent  over  the  lifetime  of  the  project.  Potential  revenues  from  carbon  finance  might, \ntherefore,  constitute  a  large  percentage  of  annual  interest  payments  and  initial  operation  and \nmaintenance costs during the first several years. Other positive impacts include (i) the expansion of \nlow-carbon  energy,  offsetting  emissions  from  thermal  power  plants,  (ii)  transmission  system \nefficiency improvements, and (iii) economic growth related to the improved power supply to millions \nof customers. The cumulative reduction of other pollutants is estimated as follows: (i) 2.8 million t of \nsulfur dioxide, (ii) 1.4 million t of nitrogen oxides, and (iii) 0.5 million t of particulate matters (every \n20 years). \n \n42. \nNonsovereign  Borrowing.  POWERGRID  plans  to  mobilize  funds  for  capital  investment \nthrough  ADB  loans,  other  foreign  borrowings,  domestic  bonds  and  loans,  and  internal  resources. \nBased  on  the  CERC  tariff  norms,  POWERGRID  is  seeking  to  arrange  70%  debt  financing  for  its \nsubprojects.  Of  this  debt  financing,  approximately  70%  is  raised  in  Indian  rupees  from  the  local \nmarket. However, the local market is constrained from providing long-term funding which is required \nin  order  to  properly  amortize  the  capital  costs.  Therefore,  POWERGRID  regularly  accesses  long-\nterm  foreign  loans  from  multilateral  financing  institutions  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  with \nGovernment  guarantees.  As  its  borrowing  requirements  are  substantial  to  meet  2012  goals, \nPOWERGRID  has  requested  a  nonsovereign  loan  from  ADB.  The  nonsovereign  loans  will  allow \nPOWERGRID  to  access  a  new  source  of  funding\u2014the  syndicated  offshore  banking  market  for \nforeign-currency  loans\u2014and  to  develop  relationships  with  the  commercial  market,  which  will \nimprove POWERGRID\u2019s visibility and credibility as a reputable borrower and enhance its corporate \nprofile. Eventually, it will assist POWERGRID to (i) move from Government-guaranteed lending to \ncommercial borrowing without any credit enhancement, and (ii) become a more commercially viable \nentity.    \n \n43. \nPrivate\u2013Public  Partnership.  Subject  to  applicable  ADB  policies  and  due  diligence,  the \nFacility can be used for financing POWERGRID\u2019s equity investment at its request for joint venture \ntransmission projects with private sector investors and financial institutions. This could be combined \nwith  ADB\u2019s  other  instruments,  including  guarantees  and  syndications  of  loan  and  guarantees \nthrough  the  private  sector  window,  to  accelerate  private-public  partnership  in  the  transmission \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nsector and help ADB play a more proactive role in private sector participation. POWERGRID plans \nvarious joint venture projects between now and 2012. \n \nD. \n\nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria \n\n44. \nCEA  carries  out  least-cost  generation  expansion  and  long-term  transmission  planning \nstudies for the country using an integrated resource planning approach to ensure optimum use of \nnational  power  resources.  Based  on  these  studies,  POWERGRID,  as  the  central  transmission \nutility,  formulated  its  investment  plan  during  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  period  through  exhaustive \nengineering  design  calculations.  POWERGRID  employs  state-of-the-art  commercially  available \npower  system  simulation  software  packages  to  perform  detailed  power  flow  studies,  short-circuit \ncalculations,  and  dynamic  and  transient  stability  analyses  to  ensure  a  robust  yet  optimal  national \ntransmission  grid  based  on  internationally  proven  extra-high  voltage  AC  and  HVDC  transmission \ntechnologies. \n \n45. \nprojects have been selected based on criteria which includes the following. \n \n\nAll  projects  have  been  subjected  to  a  rigorous  and  strict  scrutiny  process.  The  proposed \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe project is technically feasible and is part of the least-cost development plan. \nThe project is part of the 11th Five-Year Plan. \nThe project is economically viable.  \nThe  project  is  socially  sound  and  will  include  measures  to  mitigate  any  adverse \nsocial impacts, if any. \nSufficient  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the  project  as \nscheduled. \nAll necessary central and state government approvals will be obtained for the project \nin a timely manner.  \nThe  SEB  or  other  beneficiary  of  the  project  has  a  satisfactory  payment  record  with \nPOWERGRID,  i.e.,  POWERGRID  will  maintain  accounts  receivable  at  a  level  not \nexceeding an amount equivalent to the income proceeds of its transmission services \nfor the preceding 3 months of billable amount as allowed by CERC. \n\n \nE. \n\nInvestment Program Cost Estimates \n\n46. \nThe investment program is estimated to cost the equivalent of about $2,542 million including \ntaxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loans from ADB during construction (Table 2). \nThe detailed cost estimates of the investment program are provided in Appendix 5. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Program Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA.

These will be subject \nto  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  request  (PFR)  by  POWERGRID  and  India,  and \nexecution of the related loan and guarantee agreements. POWERGRID and India have entered into \na  framework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB,  which  satisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in \nAppendix 4 of ADB\u2019s policy.12  POWERGRID has also requested a $400 million nonsovereign loan. \nAs  and  when  decided  by  POWERGRID,  the  nonsovereign  loan  will  be  presented  in  a  separate \nreport and recommendation to the board.   \n \n48. \nThe  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans  will  apply  to  each  loan  under  the  Facility,  subject  to \nmodifications, if any, that might be included under each loan agreement. The specific terms of each \nloan  will  be  based  on  the  related  PFR,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility. POWERGRID has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision \nto  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere made independently, and did not rely on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n49. \nguarantee provided by India.

POWERGRID  has \nsubmitted to ADB the first PFR for tranche 1, requesting $400 million. This will cover payment for \nsubstation contract packages of Project 1 and transmission line contract packages of Project 2. The \nfirst PFR is presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors together with this document and the FFA. The \nloan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. It will have an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year on full undisbursed amount, and such other terms  and conditions as agreed in the Loan \nAgreement.  \n \n51. \nEach  project  will  consist  of  one  or  more  components.  POWERGRID  will  ensure  that  the \nentire  Project  meets  the  project  selection  criteria  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policy  requirements \nwhen  any  component  under  the  Project  is  proposed  for  funding  under  the  Facility.  A  component \nmay  include  one  or  more  contract  packages.  In  case  a  component  or  a  contract  package  is \nfinanced by multiple loans under the Facility, ADB will ensure that the entire component or contract \npackage is in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements when any loan is requested.  \n \n52.   Along with the first PFR, POWERGRID has submitted to ADB a component-wise financing \nplan under the Facility and a contract-wise financing plan under the first tranche. The second and \nsubsequent  PFRs  may  include  a  revised  component-wise  financing  plan  and  a  contract-wise \nfinancing plan for subsequent tranches.  \n    \nH. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nthe  executive  director  (corporate  planning)  at \n\nPOWERGRID  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  investment  program,  and  has  set  up  a \n53. \nprogram  management  unit  headed  by \nits \nheadquarters.  The  unit,  through  the  related  functional  departments  of  POWERGRID,  will  be \nresponsible  for  processing  and  implementing  the  investment  program.  POWERGRID  has  nine \nregional  offices  headed  by  an  executive  director  or  general  manager  to  implement  the  projects \nunder their respective jurisdictions. The additional general manager or deputy general managers in \nthe  region  responsible  for  construction  and  commissioning  of  subprojects  will  report  to  their \nrespective  regional  heads.  The  regional  heads  will  facilitate  submission  of  the  implementation \nprogress  reports.  The  management  of  POWERGRID  will  receive  monthly  progress  reports  and \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nreview each project in quarterly review meetings. The PMU will maintain regular consultations with \nADB and other funding agencies for implementation of the projects. \n \n54. \nThe  investment  program  will  follow  MFF  implementation  procedures.  POWERGRID  will \nappraise all projects and be responsible for processing and implementing them. POWERGRID will \nprepare  a  project  appraisal  report  that  will  include  (i)  the  rationale  for  each  project,  (ii)  the  scope \nand  components,  (iii)  a  technical  description  and  analysis,  (iv)  the  cost  estimates  and  financing \nplan,  (v)  an  environmental  assessment,  (vi)  a  resettlement  plan,  (vii)  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan, and (viii) the implementation arrangements along with financial, economic, and \ninstitutional  analyses.  POWERGRID  will  be  supported  by \nfunded  by \nPOWERGRID  in  preparation  of  technical  specifications  and  bidding  documents,  bidding  and \nevaluation, construction supervision, and testing and commissioning of Project 2. \n \n\ntechnical  experts \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n55. \nThe  proposed  Facility  will  be  implemented  over  7  years,  inclusive  of  procurement  and \nconstruction  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  March  2015.  The  implementation \nschedule of projects 1 and 2 is provided in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n56. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the  investment  program  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  For  such  procurement,  bid  specifications  will  be  prepared  in  a  manner  to  ensure  maximum \ncompetition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  A  procurement  plan  and  indicative  contract  \npackages  for  Tranche  1  is  in  Appendix  7  and  an  assessment  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  procurement \ncapacity  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  Procurement  plans  will  be  prepared  for  each \nPFR.   \n \n57. \n To  further  facilitate  procurement  process,  POWERGRID  will  initially  prepare  a  model \nbidding  document  for  each  type  of  contract  package  under  the  Facility,  such  as  transmission \ntowers, conductors, insulators, hardware fittings, and substations, and will seek approval from ADB \nfor such model bidding documents. In preparing such model bidding documents, POWERGRID will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Standard  Bidding  Document  for  Procurement  of  Goods  for  supply,  erection  and \ncommissioning  contracts  as  well  as  supply-only  contracts,  and  identify  sections  of  bidding \ndocuments that may be specific to each procurement package. Upon ADB\u2019s approval of the model \nbidding  documents,  POWERGRID  will  be  exempted  from  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  of  its  bidding \ndocuments  provided  that  (i)  such  documents  are  in  line  with  the  corresponding  model  bidding \ndocument, and at the time of release of invitation for bid, they are forwarded to ADB for post-facto \napproval, and (ii) POWERGRID issues amendments to such documents based on comments made \nby ADB, if any, during the bidding period. Further, POWERGRID may also award contracts of value \nless than $10  million in each case without seeking prior approval of ADB, provided that the lowest \npriced bidder at bid opening is also the recommended bidder for contract award. All cases involving \nunusual issues shall be submitted to ADB for prior review, and ADB shall retain the right to disallow \nutilization of loan proceeds in case (i) it is unable to agree with POWERGRID on either the bidding \ndocuments  or  the  bid  evaluation  report,  either  in  prior  or  post-facto  review  cases,  or  (ii) \nmisprocurement is established after due process. \n \n58.  Before commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB, \nthe Government of India, and the Borrower will review the public procurement rules and regulations \nof  the  Government  of  India,  and  the  Borrower's  Works  &  Procurement  Policy  and  Procedures  to \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nensure consistency with the Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications or clarifications \nwill be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n59. \nPOWERGRID has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for procurement \nof  goods  up  to  20%  of  each  tranche  for  a  period  of  up  to  12  months  prior  to  loan  signing.  ADB \nmanagement  has  agreed  to  approve  retroactive  financing  for  all  projects  under  the  Facility  up  to \n20%  of  the  proceeds  from  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  provided  that  expenditures  are  in \naccordance with the Procurement Guidelines and safeguard policies, and were incurred during the \n12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement.  POWERGRID  was \ninformed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  or  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the ensuing project. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \n60. \nwith  POWERGRID.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  and  examine  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nalleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprojects  under  the \ninvestment program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  investment  program  shall  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of \nPOWERGRID,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \ninvestment program. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n61. \nEach  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed between POWERGRID and ADB. Loan disbursements will be \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  POWERGRID  and  ADB.  No  imprest  account  will  be \nrequired for disbursement under the Facility.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n62. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the investment program \nwill  be  established  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  and  practices  satisfactory  to  ADB. \nWithin  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  POWERGRID  will  submit  (i)  annual  project \naccounts,  with  detailed  descriptions  of  the  sources  of  receipts  and  expenditures;  and  (ii)  annual \nfinancial statements comprising an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and \nrelated  notes  to  the  financial  statements  and  consolidated  for  all  of  POWERGRID\u2019s  operations. \nPOWERGRID  will  continue  the  current  practice  of  hiring  independent  chartered  accountants  to \naudit its annual financial statements and annual project accounts, together with the memorandum \non issues identified during the audit process (i.e., management letter). These will be submitted with \nthe  respective  reports.  The  accounts  will  be  prepared  using  accounting  standards  issued  by  the \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  covenants  and  indicate  the  details  of  the  actual \ncalculations for all ratios, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan Agreement. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n63. \nPOWERGRID  will  prepare  progress  reports  for  its  respective  projects  and  submit  these  to \nADB on a quarterly basis within 45 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide (i) a \nnarrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation \nschedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  (iv) \nthe  project \nimplementation  consultants,  and  (v)  the  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  next  period.  The  progress \nreport will also include a summary financial account for the project loan components, consisting of \nproject expenditures for the year to date and total expenditure to date, and a contract-wise financing \nplan.  POWERGRID  will  undertake  periodic  project  performance  review  under  each  individual \ntranche  of  the  loan,  and  also  for  the  investment  program  to  evaluate  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements,  progress,  and  achievements  of  objectives  of  the  related  project  and  the  overall \ninvestment program.13 Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework.  \n \n\nthe  performance  of \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n64. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  the  investment  program  approval. \nADB will review the implementation and operation of the investment program based on the quarterly \nprogress  reports  and  meet  with  POWERGRID  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  the \nprogress  of  the  individual  project  and  any  changes  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial \nmeasures  required  to  be  undertaken  towards  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  projects  and \ninvestment program. \n \nA  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2  years  after  the  loan  effectiveness,  focusing  on  the \n65. \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing the \nfinancial  status  of  POWERGRID.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  POWERGRID  will  take  part  in  the \nreview,  which  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure  successful  project \nimplementation and achievement of objectives. \n \n66. \nPOWERGRID  will  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  within  6  months  of  physical \ncompletion of the projects, and a facility completion report within 6 months of physical completion of \nthe investment program.

The  proposed  investment  program  is \nexpected  to  support  the  achievements  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  by \nincreasing  transmission  capacity  and  enhancing  reliability  and  efficiency  of  the  transmission \nnetwork. Reliable power supply through expansion and augmentation of the national transmission \ngrid will remove the hindrance to economic growth in India caused by an unstable electricity supply. \n\n                                                 \n13 POWERGRID has a Corporate Monitoring Department headed by an executive director. The department has sufficient \n\ncapacity and systems to monitor individual projects as well as the entire investment program. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\nTechnical Analysis \n\nThe investment program will also help reduce 821 million t14 of CO2-equivalent emissions, primarily \nby  replacing  thermal  generation  at  demand  sites  with  cleaner  transmitted  hydropower.  The \ninvestment program will help enhance the commercial viability of POWERGRID by providing long-\nterm funding support for its immediate investments and promoting various measures to strengthen \ncorporate governance and improve operational efficiencies. \n \nB. \n \nHydropower  potential  in  the  Tehri  Valley  is  being  tapped  by  the  development  of  three \n68. \nintegrated power stations: the 1,000 MW Tehri-I plant, the 400 MW Koteshwar plant, and the 1,000 \nMW Tehri-II pumped storage facility. In May 2006, POWERGRID commissioned the first phase of \nthe transmission system associated with the power generation plants. The Tehri-I generation plant \nis  under  operation  and  Koteshwar  generation  plant  will  be  operating  by  the  end  of  2008,  and  the \nTehri-II  pumped  storage  facility  is  planned  to  be  commissioned  by  June  2011.  The  transmission \ncapacity  must  be  expanded  in  order  to  deliver  power  to  Delhi  and  transfer  beyond  to  various \nbeneficiaries of the northern region through existing and proposed transmission lines. \n \n69. \nThe  northeastern  region,  Sikkim,  and  Bhutan  are  also  endowed  with  large  hydropower \npotential. The generation addition of about 35,000 MW in the northeastern region, and 15,000 MW \nin Sikkim and Bhutan, are expected in the future. Considering the low growth of power demand in \nthe northeastern region, Sikkim, and Bhutan, it is estimated that about 42,000\u201345,000 MW will be \nsurplus  in  these  areas,  whereas  the  generation-addition  scenarios  for  the  northern  and  western \nregions indicate that these regions will remain in a serious deficit situation in the foreseeable future. \nTherefore,  surplus  power  from  these  generation  sources  will  have  to  be  transmitted  to  the  load \ncenters of the northern and western regions over long distances. POWERGRID has studied various \noptions  for  reliable  bulk  power  transmission  over  long  distance  in  association  with  electric  power \nresearch  institutions,  equipment  manufactures,  consultants,  and  experts  across  the  world,  and \nconcluded  that  an  \u00b1800kV  HVDC  transmission  system  would  need  to  be  installed  and \ncommissioned  in  stages  matching  with  the  development  of  hydropower  generation  projects  in  the \nnortheastern region, Sikkim, and Bhutan. Further studies recommended that construction of parallel \nconverters of 3,000 MW each in two stages for an ultimate capacity of 6,000 MW would be suitable \nin view of the commissioning schedule of the 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower hydropower plant by 2012 \nand the 600 MW hydropower plant at Kameng by 2011. In addition, a number of power producers \nhave  submitted  applications  for  transferring  a  total  of  about  4,000  MW  of  power  by  2012  from \nSikkim to the northern and western regions. \n \nC. \n \n70.  While the financial management structure of POWERGRID was assessed and found to be \nadequate during the processing of LN 2152-IND (footnote 7), a financial management assessment \nwas undertaken to ensure the current ability of POWERGRID to fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements \nunder the proposed Facility. A financial management assessment questionnaire was completed by \nPOWERGRID  to  facilitate  a  review  of  its  financial  systems  and  processes,  and  to  identify  any \nissues or constraints.  \n \n71. \nfairly  advanced,  utilizing \ncomputerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. Existence of well-defined charts \nof  accounts  enables  proper  recording  of  financial  transactions.  Accounting  policies,  based  on  the \naccounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, have been framed \n\nfinancial  accounting  system  of  POWERGRID \n\nFinancial Management and Financial Analysis \n\nThe \n\nis \n\n                                                 \n14 Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nfor  accounting  and  preparation  of  the  financial  statements.  Accounting  and  financial  reporting \nresponsibilities  are  carried  out  as  per  the  delegation  of  powers  defined  and  approved  by \nPOWERGRID\u2019s board of directors. POWERGRID\u2019s Finance Department has developed procedures \nand  guidelines  for this  reporting.  POWERGRID  has  constituted  a  committee  of  three  independent \nchartered  accountants  to  review  its  existing  procedures,  systems,  and  capabilities  in  the  area  of \nfinancial  management,  including  risk  management.  The  updated  manuals  have  been  shared  with \nADB.  The  recent  issue  of  POWERGRID  shares  to  the  public  is  expected  to  further  enhance \naccountability, transparency, and predictability of its financial governance through further disclosure \nof information to shareholders, investment professionals, and the general public.   \n \n72. \nPOWERGRID  maintains  a  sound  financial  position  and  generates  sufficient  cash  flow  to \ncover  its  cost  of  service,  capital  investment,  and  debt  payments.  In  FY2007,  POWERGRID \ngenerated Rs. 40.8 billion ($1,020 million) in revenue and Rs. 34.5 billion ($862.5 million) in gross \nearnings. This generated a net income of Rs. 12.3 billion ($308 million), up 22% over the previous \nfiscal year. Compounded average growth over the past four fiscal years was 13%. Its profit margin \nfor  the  past  four  fiscal  years  has  been  between  27%  and  30%,  which  is  relatively  healthy  for  a \nregulated business. POWERGRID has maintained relatively modest debt levels with a debt-equity \nratio of 64:36 in FY2007. Its leverage is likely to gradually increase to keep pace with heavy capital \nexpansion.  Although  the  projected  capital  expansion  plan  is  aggressive  and  will  require  a  much \ngreater  level  of  borrowings,  the  financial  projections  show  that  POWERGRID  will  remain  in \ncompliance with covenanted levels on the long term debt-equity ratio, accounts receivable, and self-\nfinancing ratio. Further details on POWERGRID\u2019s financial performance are provided in Appendix 8.  \n \n73. \nFinancial  analysis  of  Tranche  1  projects  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects. 15  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been \nexpressed  at  constant  2006  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR),  i.e.,  capital  investment,  and  operations  and  maintenance  reflect  the  costs  of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. The current transmission tariff scheme was used to estimate the \nrevenue, while incremental operation and maintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n74. \nThe FIRR of 7.9% compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC)  of  5.2%,  indicating  financial  viability  for  the  projects.  Financial  viability  was  gauged  by \ncomparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  with-project  and  without-project  investment \nscenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  increased  evacuation  of  power  within  the \ntransmission system due to the removal of transmission constraints as a result of the investment. \nNonquantifiable  financial  benefits,  such  as  quality  of  power  supply,  were  not  included  in  the \nfinancial evaluation. A summary of the financial analysis is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n75. \nSensitivity  and  risk  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRRs  are  robust  with  (i)  a  20%  increase  in \ncapital  costs,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  (iii)  a  1-year \nimplementation delay. As the principles of tariff allow POWERGRID projects to pass on the costs of \n(i) the full cost recovery of the loan capital, (ii) depreciation, (iii) return on equity, (iv) operation and \nmaintenance  expenses,  and  (v)  interest  on  working  capital,  the  differences  of  the  options  are \nmarginal. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2005.

A  time-slice  approach  was  adopted  and  the  entire  power  sector  investment \nprogram  was  considered,  including  upstream  generation  costs  and  downstream  transmission  and \nrelevant distribution costs. The validity of CEA\u2019s national electricity demand forecasts was verified \nand the least-cost nature of the proposed investment program was confirmed. The main economic \nbenefits  are  displaced  thermal  electricity  generation  and  incremental  consumption.  Based  on  the \ninterregional transmission capacity that will be added through the investment program, and demand \nand  generation  capacity  and  plant  factor  forecasts  capacity  contained  in  the  National  Electricity \nPlan  (Transmission),  expected  interregional  power  flows  for  winter,  monsoon,  and  summer  were \nmodeled and used to quantify benefits. Nonincremental output displaces generation from coal-fired \nthermal  plants  and  captive  diesel  plants  and  was  valued  on  this  basis.  Incremental  output  was \nvalued  using  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  incremental  consumption.  The  overall  investment \nprogram  has  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  13.1%,  indicating  that  it  is \neconomically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  revealed  that  expected  economic  outcomes  are  robust \nunder  a  range  of  downside  scenarios,  reflecting  the  strong  link  between  an  adequate  electricity \nsupply and economic growth. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 10. \n \nE. \n \n78. \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF),  which  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures,  and  institutional  requirements  for  the  overall  investment  program  and  each  tranche, \nhas been prepared for the investment program (see Supplementary Appendix D). POWERGRID as \nthe  Executing  Agency  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental  assessments  and \nobtaining  all  necessary  government  clearances,  along  with  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  prior  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  program.  The  environmental  assessment  of  the  proposed  investments  is \nbeing  conducted \nthe  EARF,  POWERGRID\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Policy & Procedures 2005 (ESPP), and the Government\u2019s environmental \nassessment  regulations  and  guidelines.  The  proposed  first  tranche  projects  are  classified  as \ncategory  B  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy.  POWERGRID  has  prepared  an  Initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE) \ntranche  projects.  Additional  environmental \nfirst \nassessments will be prepared in due course for the future tranche projects, as outlined in the EARF. \n \nBased on the IEE results and reconnaissance surveys, most of the impacts will occur during \n79. \nthe  construction  phase.  Such  measures  as  selective  routing  for  transmission  lines,  the  proper \ndesign  of  distribution  substations,  appropriate  erosion-control  measures,  suitable  management  of \nconstruction-related  wastes,  and  provision  of  compensation  for  reforestation  (if  required)  will \nmitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  the  investment \nsubprojects. Measures such as (i) compliance with India\u2019s national and state environmental, health, \nand safety regulations, and guidelines; (ii) proper equipment and hazardous material handling and \ndisposal, (iii) conformity with the ESPP and POWERGRID\u2019s operations and maintenance manuals, \nand (iv) periodic environmental monitoring, will address the identified environmental impacts during \n\nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002), \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1997.

The land required for the construction of transmission towers and placement \nof  transmission  lines  is  primarily  government  owned.  In  cases  when  the  transmission  line \nconstruction  affects  agricultural  production,  compensation  provisions were  prepared  for  temporary \nland acquisition. Land to be acquired for new distribution substations is mostly uninhabited, unused, \nand lies outside urban or rural settlements. \n \n80. \nThe enclosed summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) (Supplementary Appendix \nC) and environmental management plan (EMP) (Supplementary Appendix D), present the full list of \nadequate environmental mitigation and monitoring provisions and associated cost estimates for the \nEMP  implementation.  POWERGRID  will  incorporate  the  relevant  environmental  requirements  into \ncivil  contracts  and  operation  subcontracts  (as  necessary).  The  project  contractors  will  bear  the \nprimary  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction phase. POWERGRID assumes the ultimate responsibility for the overall adherence to \nthe  IEE  recommendations,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  on  the  EMP  implementation  for  each \nspecific project. \n \nF. \n \nA  compensation  plan  for  temporary  damages  (CPTD)17 was  prepared  in  full  consultation \n81. \nwith  affected  communities  to  address  the  negative  impacts  under  the  projects  according  to  the \nprovisions  agreed  upon  in  the  resettlement  framework.  Impacts,  which  will  be  due  to  the \nconstruction  of  an  HVDC  transmission  line,  are  not  expected  to  be  significant.  No  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  was  prepared  for  the  first  tranche  of  the  Facility  since  no \nsignificant impact is expected. However, additional assistance is provided in the entitlement matrix \nof the CPTD for indigenous peoples and other vulnerable affected persons.  \n \n82. \nA resettlement framework and an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) have \nbeen prepared and will serve as a basis for preparing the CPTD and IPDP for additional projects as \nrequired, according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998), the Land Acquisition Act, 1884, the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for \nProject Affected Persons (NPRR) (2003), and POWERGRID\u2019s ESPP. All plans will be prepared in \nfull consultation with affected persons, will be disclosed to them, and all compensation will be paid \nprior to the commencement of civil works. \n \n83. \nParticipation  of  affected  communities  was  used  as  a  fundamental  means  to  minimize \nadverse impacts. In particular, consultations with local communities have contributed to minimizing \nimpacts in the corridor of the transmission line. No permanent land acquisition will be necessary. In \naddition,  POWERGRID  will  schedule  the  civil  works  in  such  a  way  as  to  minimize  or  even  avoid \ndamage to crops. POWERGRID has already allocated sufficient budgetary resources to cover the \ncompensation  packages  provided  in  the  CPTD.  A  maximum  estimated  maximum  4,926  hectares \n(ha)  of  land  is  expected  to  be  affected  on  a  temporary  basis  for  the  transmission  line  corridor, \naffecting  a  maximum  of  14,085  affected  persons18 (for  less  than  10%  of  their  assets).  A  total  of \n20,285  trees  will  also  need  to  be  compensated  for,  according  to  the  provision  in  the  CPTD.  The \nsummary short resettlement plan (CPTD) for Projects 1 and 2 is provided in Appendix 11. \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Compensation  plans  in  case  of  transmission  lines  which  do  not  require  permanent  land  acquisition,  according  to  the \n\nGovernment laws. \n\n18 The  number  of  affected  persons  is  the  most  conservative  estimate.  POWERGRID  will  schedule  civil  works  in  such  a \nway  as  to  minimize  (or  even  avoid)  impacts  and  substantially  reduce  damage  to  crops  and  therefore  the  number  of \naffected persons. The maximum estimated number of affected households is 4,115. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nPoverty Assessment \n\nPotential Risks and Assumptions \n\nThe  resettlement  framework  and  the  IPDF  were  uploaded  to  the  ADB  and  POWERGRID \n84. \nwebsites prior to loan appraisal. The CPTD was disclosed to the affected persons in local language \nand uploaded to the ADB and POWERGRID\u2019s websites. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is presented in Appendix 12. The resettlement framework and IPDF are provided as part of \nthe FFA (Supplementary Appendix E and F). \n \nG. \n \nThe  investment  program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  by  the \n85. \nprovision  of  an  adequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity,  which  will  support  the  Government\u2019s \nprojections  for  growth  in  energy  demand  and  confirmed  intent  to  make  affordable  grid-based \nelectricity supplies available to all by 2012. A secure and predictable electricity supply will provide \nsocial  and  economic  benefits,  and  ensure  improved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other \nsocial services. \n \n86. \nIn  addition,  the  improvement  of  the  interregional  transmission  capacity  is  expected  to \nimprove the distribution of economic benefits and industrial development normally associated with \npower supply and access to reliable electricity throughout the country. \n \nH. \n \n87. \nKey assumptions are that (i) the Government will remain committed to power sector reforms \nand development of the national electricity market, (ii) the Electricity Act 2003 will be implemented \nin a timely and transparent manner, and (iii) macroeconomic growth will remain stable. \n \n88. \nRetail distribution of electricity in India is essentially handled by SEBs, and POWERGRID is \nexposed to this credit risk. While the one-time tripartite agreement settlement in 2004 resolved the \npast-due  receivables  and  provided  incentives  for  the  improvement  of  current  dues  of  the  SEBs, \nthere  is  still  a  residual  risk,  as  many  SEBs  are  still  loss-making.  CERC,  which  sets  the  interstate \ntransmission tariffs in India, issued the most recent tariff order in 2004, to reduce POWERGRID\u2019s \nreturn on equity from 16% to 14% on a post-tax basis. There may be a possibility that CERC will \nconsider  further  reduction  to  lower  the  cost  of  power  and  augment  resources  of  SEBs.  Although \nPOWERGRID\u2019s current financial position is strong and its cash flow remains stable due to a cost-\nplus  tariff  structure,  with  all  debt  servicing,  foreign  exchange  losses,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance and costs allowed to be passed through, these risks may impact on its cash flow and \nimplementation  of  the  investment  program.  However,  such  risks  appear  to  be  low  given \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  strong  financial  position  and  stringent  payment  discipline  for  SEBs  introduced  in \n2003. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to estimate aggregate impact from unfavorable changes \nin  key  variables.  Under  downside  scenarios,  POWERGRID  would  maintain  its  financial  viability  to \nfully meet funding requirements of the investment program in a timely manner.  \n \n89.  Other risks to the investment program include (i) delay in associated generation investments, \n(ii)  increased  prices  of  materials,  and  (iii)  the  failure  to  meet  safeguard  requirements  in  a  timely \nmanner. The investment program is properly planned and sequenced with regard to the associated \ngeneration  plan.  Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  investment  program  indicate  that  it  is  resilient  to \nincreases  in  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  POWERGRID\u2019s  technical \ncapability to implement the investment program in a timely manner is well proven.          \n \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n90. \nPOWERGRID  and  the  Government  have  made  specific  representations  and  warranties  as \nset out in the FFA, and given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the individual \nLoan Agreements between POWERGRID and ADB.  \n \n91. \n \n\nPOWERGRID shall ensure that: \n\nProject/Subproject Selection Criteria  \n\n(i) \n\nselection of Projects, follows the eligibility criteria and procedures set out in the FFA; \n\nFinancial Governance \n\nit maintains its accounts receivable at a level not exceeding an amount equivalent to \nthe income proceeds of its transmission services for the preceding three months of \nbillable amount as allowed by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission; \nit  obtains  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  from  the  state  electricity  boards  and  other \nbeneficiaries,  in  an  aggregate  amount  based  on  average  monthly  billings  of  the \nprevious financial year, as deemed acceptable by POWERGRID and as allowed by \nCERC; \nit maintains a debt-equity ratio of 80:20 and a self-financing ratio of at least 20% from \n2007 onward; \nit exercises its rights promptly including the right to effect the reduction/stoppage of \nsupply  under  the  commercial  contracts  with  state  electricity  boards  or  other \nbeneficiaries  as  well  as  under  the  tripartite  agreements  with  the  Government,  state \ngovernments and Reserve Bank of India;  \n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n all Projects and project facilities are assessed, designed, implemented, constructed, \noperated, maintained, and monitored in accordance with all applicable environmental \nlaws, rules, and regulations of the Government, relevant States, ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), POWERGRID's Environmental and Social Policy & Procedures 2005 \n(ESPP), IEE, EIA (if necessary) and EARF; \n(a)  the  EMP  and  the  mitigation  measures  included  therein,  as  specified  in  the  IEE, \nEIAs, and EARF, as applicable, are properly and promptly implemented; (b) the EMP \nand  mitigation  measures  included  therein  are  updated  at  the  engineering  design \nstage and incorporated into the bidding documents and civil works / supply contracts; \n(c)  any  adverse \nfrom  project \nthe  environment \nimplementation  activities  is  promptly  mitigated  or  minimized  in  accordance  with  the \nEMP;  (d) any  major  accidents, \nincluding  any  safety  breaches,  violation  of \nenvironmental  standards,  and  corrective  measures  taken  thereto,  are  reported \nforthwith to ADB; (e) at least semiannual reports on the implementation of the EMP \nare submitted to ADB, and ADB is allowed to conduct annual environmental reviews; \n(e) reports and information are provided to ADB on request to enable it to verify that \nthe goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the loan have been produced \nin a responsible manner with a view to resource efficiency, waste minimization, and \nother  environmental  considerations;  and  (f)  for  any  category  A  or  B  sensitive \nprojects, an IEE or EIA, as applicable, for subsequent tranches will be prepared and \nmade available to the general public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB; \n\nthat  may  arise \n\nimpact  on \n\n\f \n\n \n \n \n \n\nLand Availability and Resettlement \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n land acquisition and resettlement is undertaken in accordance with applicable laws, \nregulations,  and  policy  of  the  Government,  relevant  States,  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995),  POWERGRID\u2019s  ESPP  2005,  Compensation  Plan  for \nTemporary  Damages  (CPTD),  as  well  as  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework and resettlement plans for each Project; \nit  (a)  prepares  and  implements  Resettlement  Plans  for  the  Projects  entailing \npermanent losses, and CPTDs for Projects entailing only temporary losses, including \nany revisions thereto due to detailed designs, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, POWERGRID\u2019s ESPP 2005 and the Resettlement Framework, \nand (b) discloses the Resettlement Plans and CPTDs to affected persons in a form \nand language easily comprehended by affected persons prior to submission to ADB \nfor  review.

Given \nthat infrastructure inadequacies now exist in both rural and urban areas, preliminary exercises \nby the Government indicate that investment in infrastructure will need to increase from 4.6% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  between  7%  and  8%  in  the  period  of  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FY2008-FY2012). \n \n2. \nDevelopment  needs  in  the  power  sector  are  vast.  India\u2019s  need  for  power  is  growing \nrapidly, with consumption increasing by about 64% over the last 10 years. The forecast growth \nof  electricity  supply  to  support  GDP  growth  of  about  9%  is  expected  to  be  8%.  This  is  higher \nthan the last 10 years, as the energy-intensive manufacturing sector is expected to increase its \nshare of GDP. However, electricity is still inaccessible to the majority of households. While over \n80% of villages are already electrified, only 44 % of total households have access to electricity, \nand in the rural areas only 33% of households have access to electricity. As of 31 March 2005, \nannual per capita electricity consumption was about 606 kilowatt-hours (kWh).  \n \nEnergy  and  peaking  shortage  are  high,  with  frequent  load  shedding  (rationing)  and \n3. \nsignificant  voltage  fluctuation  at  metered  consumer  levels.  This  undermines  industrial \ncompetitiveness and severely constrains economic growth. The major reasons for inadequate, \nerratic,  and  unreliable  power  supply  especially  at  the  state  level  are  (i)  inadequate  power \ngeneration  capacity,  (ii)  lack  of  optimum  utilization  of  the  existing  generation  capacity,  (iii)  an \ninadequate  and  aging  subtransmission  and  distribution  network,  (iv)  large  scale  theft  and  a \nskewed tariff structure, (v) slow pace of rural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity \nby the end consumer. \n \n4. \nThe total power generation capacity available to the grid was 132,329 megawatts (MW) \nas of 31 March 2007, comprising 34,653 MW of hydropower, 86,015 MW of thermal, 3,900 MW \nof nuclear, and 7,761 MW of renewable energy. State electricity boards (SEBs) own 53% of the \ntotal installed capacity, the central sector 34%, and the private sector 13%. From April 2006 to \nMarch 2007, the peak power deficit was about 13.5% (13,610 MW) and the energy deficit about \n9.9% (68,341 gigawatt-hours [GWh]).  \n \n In  India,  aggregate  technical  and  commercial  [AT&C]  losses  are  quite  high  arising \n5. \nmainly  from  distribution  losses,  unmetered  connections,  theft,  and  subsidies  to  agricultural \nconsumers.  Nationwide  AT&C  losses  amount  to  as  much  as  40%,  compared  to  the  world \naverage of 10\u201315%, while some states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat \nhave  shown  remarkable  improvement  in  reducing  AT&C  losses.  The  operational  inefficiencies \nrepresented  by  such  high  AT&C  losses,  combined  with  retail  tariffs  set  far  below  the  cost  of \nsupply, have resulted in a deterioration of the financial health of state electricity boards (SEBs).. \nDespite  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  enabling  and  encouraging  policy  and  regulatory \nframework,  poor  creditworthiness  of  SEB  remains  a  major  hindrance  to  private  sector \ninvestment in some states.  \n. \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nLegal and Regulatory Framework \n\nB. \n \n6. \nElectric  power  is  a  concurrent  matter  between  the  central  and  state  governments.  The \nMinistry  of  Power  (MOP)  is  the  policy  setting  authority  for  the  sector,  and  is  assisted  by  the \nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) which advises central and state governments and undertakes \nplanning  and  project  appraisal.  The  central  Government  is  also  a  major  investor  in  the  power \nsector  and  accounts  for  about  32%  of  generation  capacity.  It  operates  the  interregional \ntransmission grid and is responsible for developing and funding other initiatives such as national \npower  regulation,  power  trading,  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  rural  electrification. \nPrivate  generation  accounts  for  about  10%  of  supply,  and  all  other  generation,  transmission, \nand distribution is supplied at the state level. \n \nNational  power  regulation  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \n7. \nCommission (CERC) established in 1998. CERC has full authority to determine bulk tariffs and \nregulates  interstate,  regional,  and  interregional  transmission,  while  the  23  state  electricity \nregulatory  commissions  regulate  state  transmission  and  distribution.  State  and  central \nregulatory commissions have powers to (i) grant, amend, and revoke licenses; (ii) regulate the \nperformance  of  licensees;  (iii)  determine  tariffs;  (iv)  safeguard  consumers'  interest  while \nensuring cost recovery of electricity; (v) promote development of markets, including trading; and \n(vi)  rationalize  electricity  tariffs  by  making  subsidies  transparent.  The  Appellate  Tribunal  for \nElectricity deals with appeals against decisions of the CERC and state electricity regulators. \n \n8. \nTo  further  accelerate  the  sector  reforms,  the  Government  enacted  the  Electricity  Act \n2003,  which  came  into  force  in  June  2003.  The  Electricity  Act  provides  for  a  complete  legal \nframework for implementing the reforms, including the unbundling of SEBs, establishment of the \nstate regulator, licensing, and an antitheft provision. The Act also represents a departure from \nthe previous regime of the power sector by introducing more competition into wholesale as well \nas  retail  markets.  Certain  provisions  in  the  Electricity  Act,  such  as  (i)  open  access  to  the \ntransmission and distribution network, (ii) recognition of power trading as a distinct activity, and \n(iii) the liberal definition of a captive generating plant, are expected to introduce and encourage \ncompetition in the power sector. \n \n\n9. \nAmong the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) developing member countries, India has \none of the most mature environmental regulatory systems. The system is based on command \nand  control  instruments  such  as  laws,  regulations,  and  standards.  Environmental  impact \nassessments  (EIAs)  for  category  A  projects  are  prepared  in  a  manner  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguards requirements. EIAs are required for individual power plants, and, as a \ngeneral rule, are prepared by the project sponsors or owners. The Ministry of Environment and \nForests (MOEF) has the final authority for EIA approval for large power plants (above 50 MW), \nand  gives  other  environmental  permits  and  clearances  prior  to  construction  and  operations. \nState  pollution  control  boards  normally  issue  a  no-objection  certificate  for  individual  power \nplants,  and  are  responsible  for  routine  compliance  oversight.1 Construction  and  operation  of \ntransmission  lines  and  networks  are  considered  nonpolluting.  Such  projects  are  exempt  from \nthe  requirement  to  prepare  and  submit  EIAs  to  MOEF,  unless  project  works  traverse  forest \nareas.  For  these  projects,  an  implementing  agency  is  required  to  obtain  forest  clearance  from \nMOEF.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB  has  accepted  in  principle  the  regulatory  system  of  the  Government  as  adequate  for  purposes  of \n\nenvironmental management of impacts arising from power plants.   \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\n \n \n\n1. \n\nSector Policy \n\nMedium- and Long-Term Strategy \n\n \nC. \n \n \n \n10. \nCognizant  of  the  pivotal  role  that  power  sector  development  plays  in  economic  growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  confirmed  its  mission  to  provide  electricity  to  all \nhouseholds  at  an  affordable  price  by  2012.  This  goal  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  has  been \nelaborated into subsector-wise policies in the National Electricity Policy, which was prepared in \nFebruary 2005 in accordance with the Electricity Act 2003. The Government has set ambitious \nenergy  policy  objectives  to  achieve  annual  generation  capacity  of  1,000  kWh  per  capita  by \n2012.  The  magnitude  of  investment  needed  to  achieve  the  goal  is  vast.  New  generation \ncapacity of 78,600 MW and matching transmission and distribution facilities need to be added \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan period.  \n \n11. \nIntegrated  Energy  Policy.  The  Integrated  Energy  Policy  (IEP)  adopted  by  the \nGovernment  in  2006  specifies  certain  regulatory  measures  for  (i)  optimizing  the  power  supply \nmix  through  greater  use  of  indigenous  hydropower  resources  and  renewable  energy,  (ii) \npursuing  technologies  that  maximize  energy  efficiency,  and  (iii)  continuing  the  ongoing  power \nreforms to control technical and commercial losses. The Government is attempting to turn the \nIEP targets into tangible outcomes through the provision of incentives for investors to overcome \nchallenges such as (i) the perceived advantages of capital investment in everyday technology, \n(ii)  smaller  project  sizes  resulting  in  higher  transaction  costs  of  project  preparation,  and  (iii)  a  \nlack  of  institutional  capacities.  In  particular,  the  IEP  aims  to  change  the  current  hydro-thermal \nratio of 25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not less than 10% of the \ngeneration  base  by  2012.  Nationwide  energy  efficiency  potential  (including  cogeneration)  is \nestimated  at  over  20,000  MW,  but  the  realization  of  this  perspective  will  require  robust \nregulatory incentives on behalf of the Government.  \n \n12. \nTable  A2.1  shows  how  the  IEP  envisages  that  the  source  of  electricity  generation  will \nevolve over time. This projection is one possible scenario assuming that (i) the country\u2019s GDP \ncontinues to grow at 8% annually, (ii) the country\u2019s hydropower potential of 150,000 MW will be \nfully  developed,  and  (iii)  63,000  MW  of  nuclear  power  and  14,000  MW  of  wind  energy  will  be \nadded. If the envisaged hydropower and nuclear capacity addition does not occur, coal-based \ngeneration will need to fill the gap.       \n \n\nTable A2.1: Sources of Electricity Generation \n(%) \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2012 \n\nFY2022 \n\nFY2032 \n\n81.2 \n12.2 \n5.5 \n1.1 \n100.0 \n\n79.1 \n13.6 \n6.2 \n1.1 \n100.0 \n\n76.7 \n13.6 \n8.7 \n1.0 \n100.0 \n\n78.0 \n11.0 \n10.3 \n0.7 \n100.0 \n\n      Source: Integrated Energy Policy by the Government of India. \n \n\n2. \n\nNational Electricity Policy \n\n \n13. \nIn accordance with Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003, the Government formulated \nthe National Electricity Policy in February 2005 in consultation with CEA and state governments. \n\nSource \n\nThermal \nHydro \nNuclear \nRenewable \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTo achieve the overarching goal of Power for All by 2012, the National Electricity Policy aims to \n(i) fully meet power demand by 2012 with energy and peak shortages eliminated and adequate \nreserve  assured,  (ii)  supply  reliable  and  quality  power  of  specified  standards  in  an  efficient \nmanner and at reasonable rates, (iii) increase per capita availability to over 1,000 kWh by 2012, \n(iv)  ensure  minimum  lifeline  consumption  of  1  kWh  hour  per  household  per  day  by  2012,  (v) \nmake the sector financially viable, and (vi) protect consumers\u2019 interests. \n \n14. \nCoal  fuel  will  continue  to  dominate power  production  in  India  in the  near  future, as  the \ncountry  attempts  to  increase  its  generation  capacity  to  keep  up  with  growing  industrial  and \nresidential  power  demand.  While  India  will  continue  to  emphasize  development  of  large-scale \npithead  coal-fired  plants  to  take  advantage  of  domestic  coal  resources  rather  than  increasing \nfossil-fuel  energy  imports,  the  Government  will  endeavor  to  minimize  environmental  impacts \nto  develop  untapped \nthrough  employing  state-of-the-art \nhydropower sources in the northeastern and northern regions.  \n\ntechnologies  and  continuing \n\n15. \nThe  thermal-hydropower  ratio  was  close  to  50:50  in  the  early  1960s,  partly  because \nearly  economic  development  policy  emphasized  support  for  agriculture,  which  has  extensive \nirrigation  demands.  Industrial  development  became  a  priority  in  the  1960s,  after  which  new \nthermal plants dominated the generation mix. For a variety of reasons, by 2003 the Government \nrecognized  the  need  to  increase  the  hydropower  proportion  and  introduced  an  initiative  to \ndevelop  up  to  about  50,000  MW  of  new  hydropower  capacity  as  part  of  the  Power  for  All  by \n2012  policy.  Preliminary  feasibility  studies  were  conducted  under  MOP  auspices  on  over  300 \ncandidate  sites,  and  these  identified  over  30,000  MW  of  potential  hydropower  that  could  be \ncommercially  developed  (based on an  estimated  1st-year  tariff  of  Rs2 per  kWh  or less).  MOP \nhas  taken  several  policy  measures  to  accelerate  hydropower  development,  including  the \nstreamlining  of  project  approval  processes  and  a  review  of  tariff  policies.

The  generation  of  power  no  longer \nrequires a license from regulators and thermal generation does not require clearance from CEA. \nFor  hydropower  generation,  the  limit  of  capital  expenditure  above  which  CEA  concurrence  is \nrequired  has  been  raised.  It  has  taken  several  policy  measures,  including  streamlining  of  the \nproject approval process and a review of tariff policies, to accelerate hydropower development. \nRestrictions on captive power generation have been substantially relaxed to allow captive plants \n\n \nTotal \n \n48,210 \n6,380 \n10,680 \n65,270 \n \n18,900 \n22,900 \n107,070 \n\n \n% \n \n45.0 \n6.0 \n10.0 \n61.0 \n \n17.6 \n21.4 \n100.0 \n\nTotal (A+B+C) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n35 \n\n \n \n\nto  be  established  by  a  group  of  consumers,  thus  enabling  small  and  medium  industries  to \nsecure a stable power supply, and to allow captive generators to sell surplus power through the \ngrid to consumers who are allowed open access. \n \nThe  planned  capacity  addition  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  timely  investments  in \n17. \nassociated  transmission  systems.  The  open-access  policy  introduced  under  the  Electricity  Act \n2003  requires  adequate  augmentation  of  transmission  capacity.  The  Government,  therefore, \nemphasizes  development  of  the  national  power  grid,  including  interstate  connections, \ntechnology upgrade, and the optimization of transmission costs.    \n \n\nthe \n\nfinancial  viability  of \n\nDistribution Reforms \n\ninterests  while  restoring \n\n3. \n \nThe major weakness of the power sector is on the distribution side which is entirely the \n18. \ndomain of the states. Restructuring of state utilities is a major challenge, and the process needs \nto  safeguard  consumer \nthe  sector. \nConsequently,  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program  (APDRP)  was \ninitiated in 2001 to introduce reforms at the distribution level with an overall objective of reducing \nAT&C losses to 15% by 2007. The APDRP is an instrument to leverage distribution reforms in \nthe states. Therefore, priority is given to projects from those states which have committed to a \ntime-bound  program  of  reforms  including  (i)  establishment  of  a  regulator,  (ii)  filing  and \nimplementation of tariff orders, (iii) securitization of dues from central public sector utilities, (iii) \nmetering of 11 kV feeders, (iv) metering of all consumers, (v) energy audit at 11 kV level, and \n(vi) maintenance of grid discipline. Metering on 11 kV feeders has improved from 81% in 2001 \nto 96% in 2006, and metering of consumers has improved from 78% to 92% in the same period, \nbut the average AT&C losses are still close to 50%, which the Government aims to reduce to \n15% by the end of the  11th Five-Year Plan period. Functional unbundling and restructuring of \nliabilities  are  now  mandated  under  the  Electricity  Act  2003.  With  financial  support  under  the \nAPDRP, many states have unbundled their SEBs to put distribution companies under regulatory \noversight  and  some  states  have  shown  a  much  better  performance  than  the  average.  The \nGovernment  encourages  private  sector  participation \nin  distribution  and  has  privatized \ndistribution  companies  in  Orissa  and  Delhi.  Franchising  of  distribution  business  to  the  private \nsector is also encouraged by the Government as a means of loss reduction and this has been \nexplored in some states. \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation  \n\n \nSince the formulation of the Policy on Private Participation in the Power Sector in 1991, \n19. \nthe  Government  has  developed  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  to  promote  private \nsector participation, cognizant of the fact that the investment requirements for the power sector \nwould exceed the resources available in the public sector and could not be met without private \nsector  investment.  The  Electricity  Act  2003  has  opened  the  way  for  (i)  competition  in  power \ntransmission and distribution, (ii) power trading and market development, and (iii) new providers \nof power supply in rural areas.  \n \nIn  addition  to  the  traditional  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  projects,  under  tariff-\n20. \nbased  competitive  bidding  the  Government  has  initiated  larger  thermal  power  projects,  called \nultra  mega  power  projects,  and  these  use  the  latest  super-critical  boiler  technologies.  In  the \narea  of  power  transmission,  the  Government  issued  guidelines  for  private  sector  participation \nwhich envisaged two distinct options: (i) joint venture, and (ii) independent private transmission \ncompany. As a pilot joint venture project, Tata Power and POWERGRID are executing specific \ntransmission  lines  associated  with  the  Tala  Hydro  Electric  Project  and  the  East  North \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nInterconnector. In distribution, as a measure of state-level power sector reform, privatization has \nbeen implemented in Orissa and Delhi, while outsourcing through franchising is being explored \nin some states. \n \n\n5. \n\nRural Electrification \n\n \n21. \nThe key development objective of the power sector is the supply of electricity to all areas \nincluding rural areas as mandated in Section 6 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Only about 56% of \nrural households have been electrified even though many of the households without electricity \nare willing to pay for electricity. To achieve its goal of Power for All by 2012, the Government \ninitiated a new scheme called the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana in April 2005. The \nscheme  aims  to  electrify  125,000  unelectrified  villages  and  give  access  to  78  million  rural \nhouseholds  and  is  being  implemented  through  the  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  (REC). \nThrough  REC,  the  Government  provides  90%  of  the  capital  cost  of  developing  (i)  a  rural \nelectrification distribution backbone with at least one 33/11 kV (or 66/11 kV) substation in each \nblock,  (ii)  village  electrification  infrastructure  with  at  least  one  distribution  transformer  in  each \nvillage or habitation, and (iii) a decentralized distributed generation system where grid supply is \nunfeasible or not cost effective.  \n \n22. \nThe scheme also emphasizes sustainability of rural supply through collection of the cost \nof  electricity  from  the  beneficiaries.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  Government  encourages \nfranchisees  such  as  nongovernment  organizations  and  consumer  associations.  The  state \ngovernments are free to provide appropriate targeted subsidies to poor households.       \n \nD. \n \n23. \nKey  Opportunities  and  Challenges.  The  Indian  power  system  is  divided  into  five \nelectrical  regions\u2014northern,  southern,  western,  eastern,  and  northeastern.  At  present,  all \nexcept the southern region are operating in synchronism. The southern region is connected to \nthe  eastern  and  western  regions  through  asynchronous  links.

Under this strategy, coverage of the \ntransmission network will be expanded by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (POWERGRID) \nand  the  private  sector,  creating  a  national  grid  by  adding  over  60,000  circuit  kilometers  (ckm) \nand thus increasing interregional power transfer capacity to more than 37,000 MW by 2012.  \n \n\n1. \n\nNational Power Grid \n\n \n3. \nExcept  for  the  eastern  and  northeastern  regions,  all  the  regions  are  presently  facing \npower  shortages  in  the  range  of  about  300\u20136,000  MW.  Considering  the  generation  addition \nprogram by 2012, the surplus power in the eastern region will be about 12,000 MW and in the \nnortheastern region about 3,000 MW; the northern, western, and southern regions will need to \nimport power to a large extent from the eastern and northeastern regions to reduce their deficit \nsituation. According to the least-cost generation expansion program and demand projection for \ndifferent regions, the northeastern and eastern region will be the major power exporter for other \nregions.  Therefore,  development  of  strong  interregional  links  connecting  the  northeastern  and \neastern regions to all other regions is needed. \n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A3.2: Proposed Interregional Transmission Capacity (MW) by 2012\n\nAppendix 3 \n\n41 \n\nMarch 2007         2012\n  0MW  ->        3,000 MW\n\nMarch  2007       2012\n4,220 MW   -> 13,620 MW\n\nMarch  2007      2012\n2,080 MW  ->  4,180 MW March 2007    2012\n\n1,760 MW-> 6,600 MW\n\nNorthern\nInstalled capacity: \n34,701 MW\nPeak availability:\n26,500 MW\nPeak demand: \n31,500 MW\n\nDeficit: \n- 5,000 MW\n\nWestern\nInstalled capacity: \n37,160 MW\nPeak availability:\n26,085 MW\nPeak demand: \n32,506 MW\n\nDeficit: \n- 6,000 MW\n\nNorth-Eastern\nInstalled capacity: \n2,404 MW\nPeak availability:\n1,193 MW\nPeak demand: \n1,300 MW\nDeficit: \n+ 500 MW\n\nMarch 2007    2012\n3,120 MW-> 3,620 MW\n\nMarch 2007    2012\n1,240 MW-> 2,840 MW\n\nEastern\nInstalled capacity: \n16,728 MW\nPeak availability:\n10,000 MW\nPeak demand: \n9,200 MW\n\nDeficit: \n-+3,000 MW\n\nSouthern\nInstalled capacity: \n36,599 MW\nPeak availability:\n22,360 MW\nPeak demand: \n23,010 MW\n\nDeficit: \n- 740 MW\n\nMarch 2007    2012\n1,680 MW-> 3,780 MW\n\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n\n \n\n \n4. \nBy  2012,  the  eastern,  western,  and  northern  regions  will  be  interconnected  by  a  high \ncapacity  765  kV  ring,  while  the  southern  region  will  remain  interconnected  in  asynchronous \nmode. The northeastern region is also expected to be connected with the eastern region with a \nhigh  capacity  400  kV  AC  link  and  with  the  northern  and  western  regions  with  a  high  capacity \n800 kV HVDC link. This will constitute a stronger national grid with high-capacity transmission \nhighways  having  total  interregional  capacity  of  more  than  37,000  MW.  Figure  A3.2  shows  the \nprojected capacity of interregional transmission links in 2012. \n \n\n2.  \n\nStrengthening of Regional Grids and Integrated Grid Operation \n\n \nTransmission  systems  in  the  five  regional  grids  need  to  be  further  expanded  and \n5. \nstrengthened  to  provide  associated  transmission  systems  for  the  planned  generation  capacity \naddition  of  about  78,600  MW  during  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  period  and  to  realize  optimal \nutilization  of  available  generation  and  the  extra-high  voltage  grid.  POWERGRID  plans  to \nestablish  a  national  load  dispatch  center  to  interlink  five  regional  load  dispatch  centers  for \nsmooth operation and real-time monitoring of the national grid. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  aims  to  further  accelerate  the  reforms  and  underpin  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  through  (i)  expanding  coverage,  (ii)  improving \nreliability, and (iii) enhancing sustainability and efficiency of the interstate transmission network. \nExpected  outcomes  and  major  milestones  of  the  plan  are  defined  in  the  transmission  sector \n\nSector Road Map \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n1. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nroad  map.  The  sector  road  map  includes  specific  technical  targets  to  be  achieved  by  2012  in \nterms of expansion of the national power grid and reliability and efficiency of the grid operations. \nAs  POWERGRID  is  the  primary  provider  of  interstate  and  interregional  transmission  services, \nthe  sector  road  map  also  includes  various  measures  to  further  strengthen  POWERGRID\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to achieve the technical targets, based on its long-term corporate strategy. \nThese  measures  aim  to  strengthen  corporate  governance,  improve  efficiencies,  and  enhance \nthe  financial  viability  of  POWERGRID  through  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  safeguard \ncompliance,  (iii)  human  resource  management,  (iv)  information  technology,  and  (v)  cost \nreduction. \n \n \n \n7. \n The Government amended Indian Electricity Laws to enable private sector participation \nin  transmission  sector.  In  January  2000,  the  Government  issued  detailed  guidelines.  The \nguidelines envisage two routes for inviting private sector investment. One route is through joint \nventure of central transmission utility/state transmission utility and private sector.  The first joint \nventure has been established by POWERGRID and Tata Power Company Ltd for 1,200 km of \ntransmission  lines  associated  with  the  Tala  Hydro  Electric  Power  in  Bhutan  on  Build-Own-\nOperate  Transfer  basis.  The  project  was  successfully  commissioned  in  August  2006.  ADB \nprovided a loan1 for the project through its private sector window. Several joint-venture projects \nare at an advanced stage of selection of investors. The other option is through what is known as \nan  independent  private  transmission  company,  and  this  envisages  100%  private-sector \ninvestment. Part of a system strengthening project in the western region is being implemented \nin this way. POWERGRID plans various joint-venture projects2 between now and 2012. \n\n \n\nFinancial and Corporate Governance Matters \n\n2. \n \n8. \nAppointment  of  Independent  Directors.  Because  its  bonds  are  publicly  listed, \nPOWERGRID is required by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to have at least 50% of \nits  board  directors  as  nonexecutive  members.  Presently,  POWERGRID  has  nine  directors  \u2014 \nthree  executive  directors  from  POWERGRID  and  six  nonexecutive  directors.  Of  the  six \nnonexecutive  directors,  two  are  government  directors  appointed  part-time;  the  other  four  are \nindependent directors.  . \n \n9. \nInitial  Public  Offering  and  Partial  Divestment  of  Government  Shares.  As  per  the \ndecision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in November 2006, the Government has \ndecided to (i) issue shares to the public in three public-sector power companies (POWERGRID, \nthe  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  and  the  Power  Finance  Corporation)  up  to  24%  of  their \npaid-in capital and (ii) to divest itself of 5% of its shares in the companies. POWERGRID invited \nbids for its initial public offering up to 10% of its paid-in capital between 10 and 13 September \n2007.  The  divestment  of  the  Government  shares  was  planned  simultaneously.    These  actions \nhave  diluted  Government  ownership  in  POWERGRID  from  100%  to  about  86.4%.  This  is  a \npositive  step  in  POWERGRID\u2019s  corporate  governance  reform  program,  as  it  will  encourage \nfurther  disclosure  of  financial  information  to  shareholders,  investment  professionals,  and  the \ngeneral public. Public listing creates regular market information on commercial performance and \nmonitoring  by  a  separate  class  of  shareholders  other  than  the  Government  (because \nshareholders have a residual rather than priority claim on the firm\u2019s assets, the value of minority \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Tala-\n\nDelhi Transmission Limited for the Tala-Delhi Transmission Project in India. Manila \n\n2  The following joint-venture projects are planned: with Reliance Energy Ltd for transmission system associated with \nParbati-II  (800  MW)  and  Koldam  (800  MW),  with  Torrent  Power  Ltd  for  transmission  system  associated  with \ngeneration  project  at  Sugen  (Gujarat),  with  Jaiprakash  Hydro  Power  Ltd  for  transmission  system  associated  with \nKarcham  Wangtoo  (1,000  MW)  HEP,  with  Countrywide  Power  Transmission  Ltd  for  transmission  system \nassociated  with  power  projects  in  Sikkim,  and  with  Essar  Power  for  transmission  system  associated  with  power \nproject at Hazira (Gujarat). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\nshareholders\u2019  investments  in  the  utility  depends  more  strongly  on  performance  of  the  utility \ncompared with the lenders).   POWERGRID has received enormous response from the bidders \nin all categories. Massive positive market response to the share issue  reflects POWERGRID\u2019s \nexisting  corporate  governance  practices  and  demonstrated  confidence  in  the  company  going \nforward on a commercial basis.  \n \nFinancial Management. The expansion plan to meet 2012 goals will require increasing \n10. \nlevels of debt over the medium term. Based on the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission \n(CERC) tariff norms, POWERGRID is seeking to arrange 70% debt financing for its subprojects. \nSound financial management will, therefore, be very important to maintaining sustainability and \nefficiency  of  POWERGRID.  POWERGRID  regularly  issues  domestic  bonds  and  borrows  long-\nterm funds from domestic lenders and multilateral financing institutions such as the World Bank \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  with  Government  guarantees.  POWERGRID  will \nexplore  the  possibility  of  borrowing  foreign  currency  loans  from  ADB  and  the  syndicated  bank \nmarket  without  sovereign  guarantee.  POWERGRID  will  develop  relationships  with  the \ncommercial  market,  which  will  improve  POWERGRID\u2019s  visibility  and  credibility  as  a  reputable \nborrower  and  enhance  its  corporate  governance.  Eventually,  it  will  assist  POWERGRID  to  (i) \nmove  from  Government-guaranteed  lending  to  commercial  borrowing  without  any  credit \nenhancement, and (ii) become a more commercially viable entity. \n \n11. \n POWERGRID  is  exposed  to  payment  risk  from  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs).  While \nthe  one-time  tripartite  agreement  settlement  in  2004  resolved  the  past-due  receivables  and \nprovided incentives for the improvement of current dues of the SEBs, residual risk remains as \nsome SEBs are still loss-making. POWERGRID will maintain its accounts receivable at a level \nnot exceeding an amount equivalent to the income proceeds of its transmission services for the \npreceding  3  months  of  billable  amount,  as  allowed  by  CERC.  POWERGRID  will  also  obtain \nirrevocable  letters  of  credit  from  the  state  electricity  boards  and  other  beneficiaries,  in  an \naggregate amount based on average monthly billings of the previous financial year, as deemed \nacceptable by POWERGRID and as allowed by CERC. \n \n\n3. \n\nHuman Resource Development  \n\n \n12. \nSince  the  1990s,  POWERGRID  has  strengthened  its  human  resource  management \nfunctions.  As  a  result,  POWERGRID  succeeded  in  enhancing  its  employee  productivity \n(measured by the ratio of manpower to the transmission asset) to international standards. For \nfurther  strengthening  of  human  resource  management,  POWERGRID  has  been  implementing \nfully  fledged  capacity-development  initiatives.  This  includes  (i)  optimization  of  the  skill  mix,  (ii) \nshifting  towards  a  leaner  organization,  and  (iii)  expansion  of  training  programs  in  specialized \nareas for executives, managers, and line workers  \n \n\n4. \n\nInformation Technology \n\n \n13. \nPOWERGRID  has  developed  advanced  information  systems  since  1992,  when  an \ninformation system planning study was conducted and a computer-based system was adopted \nat  corporate  and  regional  offices.  Most  business  processes  are  now  computerized  through  in-\nhouse  developed  applications  and  web-enabled  applications.  The  key  applications  currently \ndeployed  include  finance  and  payroll,  an  online  grid  monitoring  system,  specialized  software \ntools  for  engineering  and  project  management,  enterprise-wide  electronic  messaging,  an \nintranet-based  management  information  system  and  information  dissemination,  and  various \nother functional reporting systems. To further enhance corporate governance and streamline its \nbusiness processes, POWERGRID plans to integrate corporate-wide information systems. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n44 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nFiduciary Oversight and Safeguard  \n\n \n14. \nPOWERGRID  already  has  a  comprehensive  internal  control  mechanism  to  verify  the \naccounting and financial management system, adequacy of controls, material checks, financial \nproperty  aspects,  and  compliance  implementation  mechanism.  POWERGRID  is  further \nstrengthening its fiduciary oversight and safeguard measures through (i) initiatives related to the \nRight  to  Information  Act,  (ii)  strengthening  its  compliance  mechanism  with  the  introduction  of \nenterprise resource planning, and (iii) continuous quality enhancement program through the ISO \nquality  assurance  system.  Under  the  Right  to  Information  Act,  POWERGRID  is  required  to \ndisclose to the public (i) the particulars of its organization, functions, and duties; (ii) the powers \nand  duties  of  its  officers  and  employees;  (iii)  the  procedure  followed  in  its  decision-making \nprocess,  including  channels  of  supervision  and  accountability;  (iv)  the  norms  set  by  it  for  the \ndischarge of its functions; and (v) the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals, and records used \nby its employees for discharging their functions. POWERGRID achieved the distinction of being \nthe  first  power  utility  and  second  company  in  the  world  to  get  certified  with  PAS  99:2006 \nintegrating the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 (quality management system), ISO 14001:2004 \n(environmental management system) and OHSAS 18001:1999 (occupational health and safety \nmanagement system).3 \n \n15. \nPOWERGRID  has  introduced  certain  committees  of  independent  eminent  persons \nrelating  to  the following matters:  (i) financial management,4(ii) procurement,  (iii) environmental  \nand social safeguards,5 and (iv) research and development. These committees report directly to \nthe chairman. In order to give more focused attention to certain areas, the board has constituted \nseveral  other  subcommittees  to  look  at  functional  matters  such  as  the  award  of  contracts, \nfeasibility  reports  and  revised  cost  estimates,  and  bonds.  Improvements  suggested  by  the \ncommittees and subcommittees are progressively incorporated into POWERGRID\u2019s procedures. \n \n16. \nPOWERGRID will enhance its accountability through (i) initial public offering of its shares \nto  the  stock  exchange,  and  (ii)  proposed  conferring  of  Navratna  status  which  enables \nPOWERGRID to make decisions on issues like joint ventures, capital expenditure, and setting \nup of subsidiary firms.  \n \n\n6. \n\nCost Reduction  \n\n \n17. \nAlthough  the  current  regulation  allows  POWERGRID  to  earn  revenue  on  a  cost-plus \nbasis, continuous cost reduction efforts are critical to prepare for change to the tariff philosophy \nto price-cap methodologies and to provide transmission services to its customers at affordable \ntariffs.  POWERGRID  will  optimize  the  capital  cost  of  transmission  projects  through  (i)  the \nadoption  of  new  technologies  at  the  planning  and  development  stages,  (ii)  an  aggressive \nprocurement  strategy  to  widen  supplies  and  its  contract  base,  (iii)  maintaining  an  appropriate \ncapital structure for project funding, and (iv) ensuring timely implementation of projects. \n                                                 \n3  Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. 2007. Available: http://www.powergridindia.com/powergrid/ \n  CITIZENCHARTER/02-0011-001.aspx \n4   This  committee  reviews  matters  such  as  (i)  existing  financial  management  policy,  (ii)  system  and  procedures  for \nenhancing financial performance and operational efficiency, and (iii) the financing of new business. The committee \ncomprises four independent members with administrative, managerial, professional, and academic experience and \nis  headed  by  a  former  comptroller  and  auditor-general  of  India.  The  committee  has  reviewed  issues  such  as  the \nmobilization of resources, cash management system, financial forecasting, and allocation of common expenditure, \nand made suggestions for further improvement which have been considered by the management. \n\n5 This committee is headed by the former secretary general of the Worlwide Fund for Nature, and also has the former \ndirector general (forests) from the Ministry of Environment & Forests as environmental specialist, a professor from \nthe Administrative Staff College of India (Hyderabad) as the R&R specialist, and includes E&S specialist members \nnominated by the World Bank and ADB to review POWERGRID\u2019s Environment and Social Policy and Procedures  \nin  light  of  International  practices  and  review  POWERGRID\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Environment  and  Social  Policy \nand Procedures. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45 \n\n   \n18. \nPOWERGRID will try to further reduce operation and maintenance costs by (i) managing \nadditions in the  transmission  system  without  corresponding  increases in  human  resources,  (ii) \nadopting  proper  monitoring  and  control  measures,  and  (iii)  following  a  stringent  regime  of \npreventive and regular maintenance and conservation of energy.  \n \nC. \n \n\nPower Transmission Sector Investment Plan and Financing Plan \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Investment \n\n \nThe total investments requirement in central transmission sector during the 11th Plan is \n19. \nestimated at  $18.75 billion, out of which POWERGRID\u2019s investment program is planned to be \n$13.75 billion, while the balance $5.0 billion is envisaged to be mobilized through private-sector \nparticipation.

For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared \nin a manner to ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding.  \n \n2. \nTo  further  facilitate  procurement  process,  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Ltd \n(POWERGRID)  will  initially  prepare  a  model  bidding  document  for  each  type  of  contract \npackage  under  the  Facility,  such  as  transmission  towers,  conductors,  insulators,  hardware \nfittings, and substations, and will seek approval from ADB for such model bidding documents.

It \nderives  income  from  the  transmission  of  electricity  and  its  primary  source  of  revenue  is \ntransmission  tariffs,  which  are  set  by  CERC  on  a  cost-plus  basis  with  a  minimum  availability \nrequirement. The current tariff regulation was put into effect on 1 April 2004 and will be revised \nin  2009.  As  a  result  of  its  regulatory  oversight,  POWERGRID  has  been  consistently  profitable \nfor  many  years.  Credit  Rating \nIndia  Limited  has  assigned \nPOWERGRID\u2019s long-term bonds a local currency debt rating of AAA stable. It has not yet been \nrated by an international credit rating agency (i.e., no foreign currency issues), but the company \nis in the process of obtaining such a rating as it considers moving into foreign currency debt and \nbond markets.   \n \nB. \n\nHistorical Financial Performance \n\nInformation  Services  of \n\n2. \nA summary of historical financial performance is shown in Table A8.1. The most recent \nfinancial results have been analyzed and some of the reasons for its performance and year-on-\nyear  changes  are  indicated.  The  information  has  been  gathered  from  audited  financial \nstatements  which  were  prepared  by  POWERGRID  in  accordance  with  its  accounting  policies \nwhich conform to Indian generally accepted accounting principles and have been audited by its \nstatutory auditors in accordance with Indian auditing standards. \n \n\nTable A8.1: Summary of Historical Financial Performance \n(Rs million, unless otherwise stated) \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\n28,313  \n11,143  \n7,855  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFY2004 \n\n28,054  \n11,002  \n7,482  \n\nItem  \n \nTotal Operating Revenue \nTotal Operating Expenses \nNet Profit \n \nCurrent Assets \nTotal Fixed Assets \nTotal Long-Term Liabilities \n \nNet Profit Margin (%) \nSFR 3-Year Average (%) \nAnnual SFR (%) \n \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times) \nLong-Term Debt-Equity Ratio \nAccounts Receivable (months) \nFY = financial year, SFR = self-financing ratio, Rs = Indian rupees. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.

This was a 15% increase in revenue compared with the \nprevious  fiscal  year.  82%  of  revenue  was  from  the  transmission  business,  with  the  remainder \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n58 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nbeing generated by the telecom business, international and domestic consultancy work, interest \non bonds, and lease income. This generated a net income of Rs. 12.3 billion ($308 million), up \n22% over the previous fiscal year. Compounded average growth over the past four fiscal years \nwas 13%. Its profit margins for the past four fiscal years have been between 27\u201330%, which is \nrelatively  healthy  for  a  regulated  business.  However,  POWERGRID\u2019s  profitability  growth  could \nbe constrained by the pace of capital expenditures, which requires increased borrowings and is \ninherently limited to a fixed rate of return. Its return on equity (ROE) for the past four fiscal years \nhas been between 8% and 10%, due to the expansion program. One would expect the ROE to \neventually  increase  to  around  14%.  However,  POWERGRID\u2019s  potential  to  increase  its \nprofitability  lies  more  in  its  burgeoning  unregulated  businesses  such  as  telecommunications \nnetwork expansion and consultancy and advisory work. \n \nPOWERGRID  has  maintained  relatively  modest  debt  levels  with  a  debt-equity  ratio  of \n4. \napproximately  60:40  in  the  past  several  years;  the  debt-equity  ratio  has  risen  to  64:36  in \nFY2007. POWERGRID\u2019s leverage is likely to gradually increase to keep pace with heavy capital \nexpansion, where projects will generally be financed on the basis of a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. \nTherefore, no significant improvement in the leverage ratios are expected in the medium term. \nAs its revenue is received almost entirely in rupees, POWERGRID has relied on the domestic \nloan  and  bond  market  for  financing,  and  it  can  obtain  13-year  tenors  for  such  financing,  a \nsubstantial portion of this on bullet repayment terms. \n \n5. \nIn  addition,  the  company  has  also  relied  on  long-term  foreign  debt  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank,  and  this  reduces  the  annual  interest  expense \nand  provides  amortization  schedules  of  up  to  20  years.  Approximately  67%  of  its  outstanding \nlong-term  debt  is  local  currency  bonds  and  term  loans,  and  the  remaining  33%  is  foreign \ncurrency loans, almost entirely from multilateral lenders. These foreign currency loans have all \nbeen  guaranteed  by  the  Government  of  India.  This  composition  of  debt  has  provided  some \nflexibility  in  terms  of  debt  servicing;  POWERGRID\u2019s  debt-service  coverage  ratio  was  1.72  in \nFY2007. \n \n6. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  main  financial  risk  is  the  risk  of  nonpayment  by  the  state  electricity \nboards  (SEBs),  its  key  receivers  of  power.  While  POWERGRID  enjoys  the  benefit  of  a  large \nnumber  of  regionally  diverse  SEBs  as  a  portfolio,  the  inherent  weakness  of  SEB  credit  is  a \ncause  for  concern.  In  FY2003,  receivables  rose  to  Rs  16.4  billion  (288 days).  To  mitigate  this \nrisk and secure past debts, the Government of India signed tripartite agreements with the state \ngovernments and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where 8.5% tax-free bonds were issued by \nRBI for all outstanding dues from state utilities as of 30 September 2001. The bonds have a 5-\nyear grace period and 10-year repayment. Interest on the bonds is paid annually by RBI. \n \n7. \nTo promote payment discipline on current electricity sales, incentives were put in place \nwhereby rebates on the bond\u2019s face value would be earned if bills were paid on time and letters \nof credit were opened in favor of central power units. As a result, the SEBs presently pay their \nbills on time and receivables have dropped to less than 2 months average sales at the end of \nFY2007. However, this payment discipline is directly linked to the implementation of reforms in \nvarious  states  and  sustainability  could  be  affected,  because  the  incentives  have  started  to  be \nphased out starting in FY2007. \n \nC. \n\nCompliance with Financial Loan Covenants \n\n8. \nThe  last  ADB  loan  to  POWERGRID  approved  in  2004  included  the  following  financial \ncovenants: (i) a long-term debt-equity ratio of 80:20, (ii) a self-financing ratio of 20% of a rolling \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n59\n\n3-year  average  of  its  actual  and  planned  capital  expenditures,  (iii)  accounts  receivable  of  no \nmore than 2 months average sales, and (iv) establishment of irrevocable letters of credit by SEB \ncustomers  in  favor  of  POWERGRID.  It  is  worth  noting  that  these  financial  covenants  are \nharmonized with other multilateral lenders to POWERGRID. \n \n9. \nPOWERGRID  has  a  successful  track  record  in  complying  with  these  covenants  in  the \npast several years. As noted above, its long-term debt-equity ratio has remained well below the \ncovenanted  level.  However,  it  is  gradually  increasing  its  debt  to  more  appropriately  mirror  the \nCERC-mandated leverage on future investments. The self-financing ratio has averaged 33% for \nthe  past  3  fiscal  years, and  is  expected  to  remain  in compliance  for the  projected period.  The \nself-financing  ratio  for  FY2007  was  30%.  However,  annual  capital  expenditure  levels  are \nprojected to increase to keep pace with power generation expansion, which will reduce this ratio \nto an average of 26% over the projected period. While the levels of accounts receivable were a \nserious  concern  prior  to  the  2003  settlement  of  SEB  dues  (see  paras.  6-7),  since  then \nPOWERGRID has complied with the covenanted level due partially to payment incentives put in \nplace for prompt payment. As of 31 August 2006, accounts receivable are less than 1 month of \naverage  sales.  In  addition,  they  are  protected  by  the  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  that  are \ncurrently  in  place  with  all  SEBs  in  an  amount  which  now  exceeds  100%  of  average  monthly \nturnover. It is proposed to maintain these financial covenants in the proposed loan. \n \nD. \n\nAssumptions on Financial Projections \n\n10. \nOperating revenue is taken from audited financial results for FY2007 and for subsequent \nyears,  based  on  the  expected  commissioning  schedule  of  transmission  assets.  POWERGRID \ncomputes  its  tariffs  based  on  full  recovery  of  the  capital  cost,  inclusive  of  (i)  interest  expense \nfrom  existing  loans,  (ii)  depreciation  in  line  with  CERC  guidelines,  and  (iii)  a  return  on  equity \n(fixed  at  14%).  Operation  and  maintenance  expenses  are  estimated  at  1.4%  of  capital  cost \noutlays  with  4%  annual  escalation.  Transmission  and  administrative  charges  are  projected  to \nescalate at the same rate as transmission charges. Operation and maintenance expenses also \ninclude  an  expected  20%  increase  in  employee  remuneration  in  FY2008  (due  to  usual  5-year \nwage  revisions).  System  availability  is  assumed  at  98.5%  for  the  purpose  of  determining \nincentive  payments.  Other  income  includes  consultancy  and  telecommunications  revenue  as \nwell  as  interest  income  from  bonds  issued  on  behalf  of  the  SEBs.  Income  from  transmission \njoint-venture  projects  is  calculated  based  on  a  10%  dividend  from  such  equity  investments \nbased  on  the  commissioning  year  of  the  project.  Revenue  realization  is  considered  at  95%  of \nbilling, with the balance assumed realized after 2 years.   \n \n11. \nAll new projects are assumed financed on a 70:30 debt-equity ratio, in line with CERC\u2019s \nguidelines.  While  a  certain  portion  of  the  capital  expenditure  plan  will  be  financed  from  its \ninternal  cash  flow  and  retained  earnings,  the  remainder  will  be  borrowed,  mainly  from  Indian \nfinancial  institutions  and  international  financial  institutions  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank. \nGenerally,  POWERGRID  plans  to  source  (i)  70%  of  its  debt  requirements  through  domestic \nloans (13-year tenors, including 3-year grace, at 9% interest), (ii) 10% through suppliers\u2019 credits \nor external commercial borrowings (13-year tenor, including 3-year grace, at 5% interest), and \n(iii) 20% from ADB and the World Bank (20-year tenor, including 5-year grace, at 4% interest). \nThe  financial  projections  also  assume  a  3%  exchange  rate  variation  per  annum  on  foreign \ncurrency loans, which is charged to the income statement but fully recoverable through the tariff. \nWhile interest rate assumptions may be low, all interest costs are an automatic pass-through in \nthe tariff and would not have a material impact on projections.   \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n60 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nAs per present tariff norms applicable from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2009, depreciation \n12. \nis charged to the income statement using the straight line method at the rates specified under \nthe  CERC  tariff  norms,  which  is  approximately  3%  for  transmission  systems.  The  rate  of \ndepreciation in the tariff is linked to the technical life of transmission assets. To compensate for \nthe possible mismatch between loan repayments and depreciation recovered through the tariff, \nCERC allows for Advance Against Depreciation (AAD) up to 7% per annum considering a debt-\nequity of 70:30 and a loan tenure of 10 years (in addition to depreciation at 3% as mentioned \nabove).  After  repayment  of  loans,  remaining  depreciation  is  readjusted  equally  over  the \nremaining  useful  life  of  the  assets.  Thus,  considering  an  average  life  of  30  years,  the \ndepreciation  falls  to  1%  per  annum  for  the  remaining  life.  AAD  is  reduced  from  sales  and \nconsidered as deferred revenue to be included in sales in subsequent years. \n \nPOWERGRID  pays  taxes  (minimum  alternate  tax  and  dividend  tax)  as  per  rates \n13. \nprescribed under applicable Indian Tax Laws. Minimum Alternate Tax is passed through in the \ntransmission tariff as per present tariff norms of CERC.  \n \nE. \n\nFinancial Projections and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n14. \nBased  on  the  assumptions  explained  above,  the  base-case  financial  projections  (in \nnominal terms) are included in Table A8.2. These projections demonstrate that POWERGRID\u2019s \ncurrent  financial  position  is  acceptable  and  adequately  recovers  its  cost  in  order  to  service  its \ndebt  prudently.  Although  the  projected  capital  expansion  plan  is  aggressive  and  will  require  a \nmuch greater level of borrowings, the financial projections show that POWERGRID will remain \nin  compliance  with  covenanted  levels  on  the  long-term  debt-equity  ratio,  accounts  receivable, \nand self-financing ratio.  \n \n15. \nBased  on  these  results,  the  financial  projections  were  tested  to  determine  their \nsensitivity  to  major  variables  and  operating  drivers  that  could  affect  POWERGRID\u2019s  viability. \nCertain  variables  (such  as  cost  overruns,  interest  rates,  and  foreign  exchange  rates)  will  not \nhave  an  impact,  as  these  fluctuations  are  directly  passed  through  in  the  tariff.  It  was  also \ndiscussed  whether  there  could  be  a  negative  cash  flow  impact  from  such  changes  while  the \nregulator  considered  a  new  petition.  However,  such  changes  can  be  automatically  adjusted \nwithout separate approvals, and if not, filings to CERC are made each year. New capital assets \nare included in the regulatory base as soon as they are commissioned. With a cost-plus tariff, \nPOWERGRID does not carry any volume risk, i.e., as long as it meets the availability target, its \ncapital and operating costs are fully compensated. It is not based on an energy component that \ncan vary with throughput on its transmission lines.  \n \n16. \nKey variables which could adversely impact POWERGRID\u2019s financial position include: (i) \nSEB  receivables;  (ii)  delays  in  project  implementation,  i.e.,  reduced  growth  of  transmission \nrevenues;  and  (iii)  possible  introduction  of  competition  in  the  transmission  subsector.  The \npossibility  of  increased  receivables  from  the  SEBs  is  the  most  likely  scenario  of  the  three \nmentioned here, but it should be tempered by the payment discipline which has been in place \nsince  2003.  Should  SEBs  decide  not  to  pay  their  bills  within  90  days,  POWERGRID  can  take \nimmediate  action  to  stop  delivering  power  through  its  lines.  However,  if  it  is  assumed  that \naccounts  receivables  on  new  sales  is  increased  to  6  months,  it  reduces  cash  flow  only  to  a \nsmall extent; POWERGRID can still adequately service its debt and meet its financial covenants \nin  all  years,  with  the  exception  of  the  self-financing  ratio  in  FY2009  and  FY2010.  It  is  highly \nunlikely that receivables would be permitted to increase to such a level without the Government \nor regulator stepping in again. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n61\n\nBased on past experience in the power sector in India, delays in project implementation \n17. \nare  moderately  likely,  as  most  large  transmission  projects  are  directly  related  to  progress  on \ngeneration  projects  which  will  supply  the  new  capacity.  To  the  extent  certain  projects  are \ndelayed, POWERGRID will naturally postpone some drawdowns of loans and or additional bond \nissues to ensure financial costs are minimized. As previously mentioned, growth in revenues is \nregulated to a 14% return on equity, so delay in such revenue growth will not have a significant \nimpact on projected performance. To some extent, the growth of unregulated business revenue \n(e.g.,  telecommunications  and  consulting  activities)  may  mitigate  any  such  delays  in  capital \nexpenditures.   \n \n18. \nFinally, the Electricity Act 2003 and the National Tariff Policy (2006) does allow for some \ncompetition  to  be  introduced  into  the  transmission  subsector,  which  may  permit  other \ncompanies to construct lines based on lowest-cost competitive bids. This process may result in \ntransmission  tariffs  which  are  lower  than  the  current  tariffs  set  on  a  cost-plus  basis.  However, \nsuch  competition  would  only  be  introduced  on  a  selective  basis  no  earlier  than  2012,  when \nPOWERGRID will have already completed (or initiated the final subprojects) a large portion of \nits  transmission  grid  network.  Furthermore,  there  was  an  attempt  by  the  Government  to \nintroduce  competition  in  transmission  2  years  ago  and  it  failed  to  attract  any  serious  interest \nfrom bidders. Therefore, it is unlikely that competition will be introduced in 2012 other than on a \nsmall-scale basis. As it is already the dominant provider of transmission capacity (and the most \nexperienced  in  constructing  such  projects),  POWERGRID  should  be  able  to  be  compete  with \nany other suppliers for future projects and remain at least as viable as with a regulated return on \nequity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\nTable A8.2: Summary of POWERGRID Financial Projections \n(Rs million) \n\n \nItem  \nBalance Sheet Summary \nCurrent Assets \nTotal Fixed Assets \nCurrent Liabilities \nNon-Current Liabilities \nTotal Equity \n \nIncome Statement Summary \nTotal Revenues \nTotal Expenses \nTotal Financial Charges \nProfit Before Tax \nTax \nProfit After Tax \n \nCash Flow Summary \nOperating Cash Flow (Post Tax) \nPlanned Capital Expenditures \nCash Available for Debt Service \nDebt Service    \nDividend Paid \nNet Cash Increase (Decrease) \n \nFinancial Ratios \nProfit Margin (%) \nGross Margin (%) \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (Times) \nLong-Term Debt-Equity Ratio \nAccounts Receivable (Months) \nSFR 3-Year Average (%) \nAnnual SFR (%) \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n2007/08 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11  2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n69,372 \n\n59,738 \n\n32,971 \n\n30,987 \n\n28,030 \n\n36,325 \n\n44,110 \n351,496  448,106  562,777  673,354  760,579   848,296  885,290  936,127  966,291 \n99,260 \n209,490  283,791  376,821  466,223  529,591   589,676  602,103  613,527  602,362 \n122,987 138,259 153,605 172,157 193,363  218,110 246,754 278,042 311,375\n \n \n\n84,986   87,446 \n\n76,823 \n\n81,451 \n\n96,995 \n\n49,842 \n\n90,448 \n\n49,529 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n38,819   40,422 \n\n48,497 \n17,019 \n13,935 \n17,543 \n1,968 \n15,575 \n\n66,680 \n21,038 \n19,058 \n26,585 \n2,983 \n23,602 \n\n76,209 \n24,697 \n24,815 \n26,697 \n2,995 \n23,701 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n93,356  107,715   117,704  124,905  129,002  131,621 \n38,937 \n29,177 \n35,050 \n31,916 \n57,634 \n32,263 \n6,467 \n3,620 \n51,168 \n28,643 \n\n37,746 \n37,152 \n54,105 \n6,071 \n48,034 \n\n36,633 \n38,739 \n49,533 \n5,558 \n43,975 \n\n4,131  \n\n33,264   35,427 \n37,631   39,403 \n36,820   42,874 \n4,810 \n32,689   38,063 \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n82,111 \n\n70,859 \n\n63,623 \n\n43,517 \n64,997  111,894  132,120  130,768  110,040   111,147 \n67,097   76,132 \n31,100 \n55,272   62,543 \n24,460 \n11,182   13,020 \n5,328 \n569 \n1,313 \n\n94,401   102,322  108,498  114,837  112,096 \n53,678 \n60,508 \n95,993 \n92,374 \n84,122 \n68,956 \n17,503 \n15,043 \n(5,632)\n8,375 \n\n74,350 \n94,422 \n78,087 \n16,431 \n(97)\n\n44,560 \n35,827 \n8,108 \n626 \n\n38,192 \n29,448 \n8,074 \n669 \n\n57,953 \n47,388 \n9,798 \n767 \n\n643  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n32\n65\n1.94\n63:37\n1.18\n20\n24\n\n35\n68\n2.20\n67:33\n1.17\n27\n25\n\n31\n68\n2.02\n71:29\n1.18\n23\n21\n\n31\n69\n1.88\n73:27\n1.15\n21\n20\n\n30 \n69 \n1.84 \n73:27 \n1.18 \n25 \n27 \n\n32\n70\n1.77\n73:27\n1.20\n30\n25\n\n35\n71\n1.70\n71:29\n1.21\n22\n30\n\n37\n71\n1.59\n69:31\n1.21\n35\n30\n\n39\n70\n1.46\n66:34\n1.25\n27\n30\n\nSFR = self-financing ratio, Rs = Indian rupees. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.

Price  contingencies  and \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe financial analysis of the proposed subprojects under tranche 1 has been carried out \nin  accordance  with  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 1  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). All financial costs and benefits have been  expressed at a constant \n2006 price level. Cost streams used for the purposes of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \ndetermination  (i.e.,  capital  investment  and  operations  and  maintenance)  reflect  the  costs  of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. The current transmission tariff scheme was used to estimate \nthe financial benefits.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  project  involves  several  subprojects.  These  individual  subprojects  are  not  stand-\nalone investments and would not yield benefits if considered in isolation from a number of other \nprojects.  Therefore,  the  financial  analysis  was  conducted  using  a  time-slice  approach  for  the \nentire  11th  Five-Year  Plan  of  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Ltd  (POWERGRID).  Hence \nthe financial viability of the overall investment program during the period 2007\u20132012 (of which \nthe subprojects to be financed under the investment program are part of) has been assessed. \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  is  also  calculated  for  the  overall  investment \nprogram  to  be  financed  by  POWERGRID  and  was  compared  with  FIRR  to  ascertain  the \nfinancial  viability  of \ninterest  during \nconstruction were excluded in the estimation of capital costs for the purpose of the FIRR, which \nis at 2006 constant prices.  \n \n3. \nFinancial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of \nwith-investment  and  without-investment  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the \nincreased  transmission  of  power  through  the  transmission  system  due  to  removal  of \ntransmission constraints as a result of the investment. Installing additional transformers and line \nextensions  and  the  construction  of  new  grid  substations  removes  the  bottlenecks  that  prevent \navailable  generation  capacity  from  being  transmitted.  Incremental  operating  and  maintenance \ncosts have been computed as a percentage of the investment. It is assumed that the investment \nwill have a 30-year economic life and residual value of Rs 46.3 billion at the end of that life. \n \n4. \nThe  principles  of  tariff  set  by  the  regulatory  agency  (the  Central  Electric  Regulatory \nCommission  [CERC])  allow  POWERGRID  to  pass  through  the  full  cost  recovery  of  the  loan \ncapital (debt-equity ratio of 70:30), depreciation (straight line), return on equity (14%), operation \nand maintenance expenses (based on fixed coefficient), and interest (based on short-term rates \nof the State Bank of India) on working capital.   \n \nC. \n \n5. \nTo  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  equity  contribution  financed  through  retained  earnings  and  a  combination  of \nforeign and local currency loans. Based on the expectations and POWERGRID\u2019s historical cost \nof borrowing, the foreign and local currency loans earmarked for POWERGRID are assumed to \ncarry different nominal interest rates. The cost of POWERGRID\u2019s equity is calculated at 14% as \nallowed by CERC tariff norms for pass-through. The other assumptions are a domestic inflation \nrate of 4.4% and an international inflation rate of 1.5%. As shown in Table A9.1, the WACC for \nthe investment program during the period 2007\u20132012 is 5.2%. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The  variables  considered  for  the \nsensitivity analyses were a 1-year implementation delay, a 20% increase in capital costs, and a \n20% increase in operation and maintenance costs (Table A9.3). As the principles of tariff allow \nPOWERGRID projects to pass through full cost-recovery of (i) the loan capital, (ii) depreciation, \n(iii)  return  on  equity,  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  expenses,  and  (v)  interest  on  working \ncapital,  the  differences  of  the  options  are  marginal.  Thus,  in  any  case,  these  rates  compare \nfavorably  with  the  estimated  WACC  value  of  5.2%,  substantiating  the  financial  viability  of \nTranche 1.   \n \n\nTable A9.3: Financial Results of Sensitivity Analyses \nFNPV \n(Rs Million) \n98,762 \n86,921 \n94,267 \n98,422 \n\n \nItem \nBase case \n1 year implementation delay \n20% increase in capital cost \n20% increase in O&M cost \n\nFIRR  \n(%) \n7.9% \n7.8% \n7.7% \n7.9% \n\n     FIRR = financial internal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value,  \n\n \n\n \n\n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n        \n                                  O&M = operation and maintenance.         \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nBackground and Approach \n\n \nA. \n \nUnder the 10th and 11th five-year plans (2002 to 2012), Power Grid Corporation of India \n1. \nLimited  (POWERGRID)  is  focusing  on  the  creation  of  a  national  grid  in  a  phased  manner  by \nadding  over  60,000  circuit  km  of  transmission  line  so  that  the  integrated  national  grid  can \nevacuate  additional  100,000  MW  and  carry  60%  of  the  power  generated  in  the  country, \nincreasing  inter-regional  power  transfer  capacity  from  11,500  MW  at  present  to  37,150  MW \n(according  to  the  Draft  National  Electricity  Plan  (Transmission)).  This  National  Power  Grid \nDevelopment Program will require an investment of Rs. 800 billion ($17.4 billion), out of which \nPOWERGRID  is  expecting  to  invest  Rs  181  billion  ($3.4  billion)  during  the  10th  (current)  plan \nand is planning an investment of Rs 550 billion ($12.0 billion) in the 11th plan. \n \n2. \nDespite its relatively strong financial capacity, it will be a challenge for POWERGRID to \nraise  sufficient  funds  in  the  domestic  debt  and  equity  markets  to  complete  the  Investment \nProgram  by  2012.  Therefore,  a  significant  part  of  funding  is  expected  to  come  from  foreign \nsources such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. Out of a total foreign \nfunding requirement of $3.7 billion for the 11th Plan, foreign funding of $ 3.0 billion is yet to be \ncommitted.  India\u2019s  open  access  transmission  network  and  the  associated  bilateral  contracts \nmarket  is  in  its  infancy.  The  private  sector  is  understandably  adopting  a  cautious  approach  to \ncommitting  capital  to  an  unproven  market.  This  places  the  onus  on  the  public  sector  to \ndemonstrate  the  market\u2019s  viability  and  thus  provides  the  rationale  and  justification  for  ongoing \npublic sector intervention. The ADB\u2019s involvement can help bring down the total cost of funds to \nPOWERGRID  and  ultimately  the  transmission  component  of  tariff  to  end-users.  This  provides \nthe context and rationale for ADB\u2019s proposed intervention. \n \n3. \nThe economic analysis of the POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program under the \n11th  Plan  (2008  \u2013  2012)  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. A time-slice approach was adopted, with the entire transmission \nand  (grid-connected)  generation  investment  program  considered.  This  was  done  to  avoid  the \ndifficulties  inherent  in  allocating  costs  and  particularly  benefits  to  individual  transmission \nprojects. Moreover, investments in inter-regional, intra-regional and inter-state transmission flow \nfrom and are inseparable from the National Electricity Plan (Generation).  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  Central  Electricity  Authority  (CEA)  prepares  national  electricity  demand  forecasts, \nusing a model called Electric Power Survey (EPS). The latest EPS, the 16th, was carried out in \n1999 and the results of the survey were published in September 2000.1  The EPS employs both \ntop-down  and  bottom-up  forecasting  techniques.  A  recent  review  saw  a  slight  decrease  in \nforecast  growth  rates  in  all  regions except  for  the  Western  Region.  The  current  Draft  National \nElectricity Plan (Transmission) uses the revised forecast. Table A10.1 shows regional forecast \npeak  demand  at  the  start  and  end  of  the  11th  Plan,  along  with  planned  peak  availability  of \ngeneration.

At this level, planning is concerned with solving the objective function of \nproviding  electricity  to  points  of  demand  at  the  lowest  possible  cost.  Modeling  and  analysis \ntakes into account and compares fuel transport costs and electricity transmission costs. In other \nwords,  the  approach  aims  to  determine  the  least  cost  means  of  supplying  consumers  with \nelectricity.  The  National  Electricity  Plan  (Generation)  and  the  National  Electricity  Plan \n(Transmission)  can  therefore  be  considered  to  be  least  cost  plans.  The  planning  approach \nadopted  by  POWERGRID  derives  an  integrated  transmission  plan  using  both  top-down  and \nbottom-up  inputs.  Development  of  the  transmission  plan  is  iterative;  various  input  (power \nstation) scenarios and off-take (grid substation) scenarios are modeled and analyzed, with the \nultimate intention being the identification of the lower cost means of developing the transmission \nnetwork  under  a  reasonable  range  of  scenarios.  In  this  sense,  the  transmission  network \ndevelopment plan encapsulated in the proposed investment program is the least cost means of \nachieving a desired set of electricity transmission outcomes.  \n \n\nProgram Costs \n\nD. \n \n6. \nAll costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant 2006 price level. The domestic \nprice  numeraire  was  used;  tradable  inputs  were  valued  at  their  border  price  equivalent  value \n(BPEV)  and  were  converted  to  domestic  equivalents  using  an  estimated  standard  exchange \nrate  factor  (SERF)  of  1.05.  Capital  costs  included  physical  contingencies,  but  excluded  taxes, \nprice contingencies and financial charges during construction. \n \n7. \nA  \u201cwith  program\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  program\u201d  test  was  employed  to  assess  the  inclusion  or \nexclusion of various capital and operating costs. The \u201cwith program\u201d scenario assumes that the \nNational  Electricity  Plan  will  be  implemented,  with  the  focus  on  an  all-India  resource \nmaximization,  development  of  shared  generation  capacity,  and  strengthened  inter-regional \ncapacity as per POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program under the 11th Plan. Under the \n\u201cwithout  program\u201d  scenario,  it  was  assumed  that  no  further  investment  in  generation  capacity \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nwould take place beyond expenditure that is already committed (taken as all expenditure up to \nand  including  2009),  and  no  further  investment  in  inter-regional,  intra-regional  and  state-level \ntransmission would be made. \n \n\nCapital costs for inter-regional transmission were taken from POWERGRID\u2019s investment \n8. \nplan,  with  appropriate  adjustments  to  remove  taxes,  financing  costs  and  price  contingencies. \nSpecific  (overnight)  capital  costs  for  thermal  (coal-fired)  and  hydropower  generation  capacity \nwere  assumed  equivalent  to  the  all-India  planning  parameters  of  Rs  40,000  per  kW \n(approximately  $930/kW)  and  Rs  50,000  per  kW  (approximately  $1,160/kW)  respectively. \nCapacity  additions  were  taken  from  the  National  Electricity  Plan  (Transmission),  with  the \ninvestment  assumed  to  precede  the  capacity  addition  by  one  year.  Investments  in  generation \nmade before 2009 were assumed to be already committed and therefore common to both the \n\u201cwith  program\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  program\u201d  scenarios.  On  the  basis  of  advice  from  CEA,  provisions \nwere included for downstream (state-level) transmission and distribution investments required to \nrelieve  any  constraints  in  delivering  peak  generation  (Rs420  billion  and  Rs1030  billion  for \ntransmission  and  distribution  respectively).  An  operation  and  maintenance  cost  allowance  of \n1.5%  of  capital  costs  was  assumed  for  new  transmission  and  distribution  equipment,  and  an \nallowance 0.75% of capital cost was assumed for new hydropower plant (again, on the basis of \nadvice from CEA).  \n \n\n9. \nIt  is  generally  acknowledged  that  significant  investment  is  required  in  downstream \ndistribution systems to improve supply quality and reliability and to reduce losses. Investments \nin supply reliability tend to be localized and do not typically part of the National Electricity Plan. \nTherefore,  whilst  a  provision  has  been  made  for  capital  and  operating  costs  associated  with \nrelieving  downstream  capacity  constraints,  the  benefits  of  system  reliability  improvements, \nautomation and non-technical loss reduction were not included in the analysis and consequently \nrelated capital and operating costs were estimated and excluded. \n\n \n\nProgram Benefits \n\nE. \n \n10. \nThe main economic benefits of the proposed investments are incremental consumption, \ndisplaced thermal electricity and displaced self-generation from diesel plant. Based on the inter-\nregional transmission capacity that will be added through the investment program, and demand \nand  generation  capacity  and  plant  factor  forecasts  contained  in  the  National  Electricity  Plan \n(Transmission), expected inter-regional power flows for winter, monsoon and summer peak and \noff-peak  periods  were  estimated  for  the  period  2012-2018  (i.e.  after  all  11th  Plan  investments \nhave  been  made).  Incremental  demand  served  and  resource  cost  saved  was  estimated  by \nsubtracting power flows in the \u201cwithout program\u201d scenario from the \u201cwith program\u201d scenario, and \nconverting  these  flows  to  energy  by  applying  appropriate  load  factors.2 Growth  in  demand  for \nelectricity beyond year 2018 was excluded from benefit estimation. \n \n11. \nNon-incremental outputs were valued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if \nthe  investment  program  was  to  proceed.  Resource  cost  saving  was  only  assumed  to  occur \nwhen: \n \n\n                                                 \n2   It was assumed that peak periods last for 3 hours per day, and each season (winter, monsoon and summer) last \n\nfor four months each. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n69\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthermal  generation  that  would  have  been  required  to  meet  demand  in  the \n\u201cwithout  program\u201d  scenario  is  replaced  with  hydropower  generation  from  the \neastern and northeastern regions in the \u201cwith program\u201d: scenario; and \ndemand that would otherwise have been met from the 25GW of existing captive \ndiesel plant is displaced by grid electricity.3 \n\n \n12. \nCoal fuel for thermal power plants was initially valued at its BPEV, based on the World \nBank\u2019s  coal  price  forecast  and  adjusted  for  the  generally  lower  quality  of  coal  used  for  power \ngeneration  in  India.  Typical  loading  and  transport  costs,  excluding  taxes,  were  added  to  base \ncoal prices to derive a 2007 BPEV of Rs2,400/tonne. Marginal operating costs of existing coal \nplant  were  estimated  based  on  actual  historical  operating  parameters  contained  in  the  most \nrecent  tariff  petition  for  a  representative  public  sector  generating  company.    Total  marginal \nthermal  plant  operating  costs  in  2007  for  electricity  delivered  at  the  power  station  gate  was \ncalculated to be Rs2.1/kWh, with an overall levelised variable cost of Rs1.8/kWh. Marginal costs \nof captive diesel plant were based on an estimated BPEV of diesel of Rs 18.9 per liter, specific \nconsumption of 0.3 liters/kWh, non-fuel O&M of Rs0.3/kWh specific capital cost of Rs30,000/kW \nand a 10 year life. This gave a total variable cost of Rs6.0/kWh and a total levelised cost for new \nplant of Rs9.4/kWh. \n\n \nIncremental  outputs  were  valued  using  consumers\u2019  estimated  willingness  to  pay  for \n13. \nincremental consumption, adjusted for medium voltage and low voltage losses as appropriate. \nFor  domestic  consumption,  a  demand  function  relating  energy  price  to  energy  demand  was \nestimated  for  each  of  the  five  regions  considered  in  national  generation  and  transmission \nplanning  (North,  West,  South,  Northeast,  and  East).  The  methodology  outlined  in  ADB\u2019s  ERD \nTechnical Note No. 3 \u201cMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity\u201d was followed. Two or more \ndata points were used for each region, adjusted for suppressed demand.   Regression analysis \nwas used to derive the five domestic demand functions. On the basis of these demand functions \nand the incremental consumption that will be enabled by the planned power sector investment \nprogram, domestic willingness to pay was estimated for each region.4 \n \n14. \nThe same approach was used to estimate demand functions for industrial, commercial \nand  agricultural  sectors.  State-level  gross  output  was  included  as  an  addition  regression \nvariable when deriving demand functions. Based on these demand functions, willingness to pay \nfor  incremental  consumption  was  estimated  on  a  regional  basis  for  the  industrial  and \ncommercial sectors, and on a national basis for the agricultural sector.5   \n \n\n                                                 \n3   CEA\u2019s General Review 2006 indicates a total 2004-2005 installed capacity of captive plant in the industrial sector \nof  19.1  GW,  with  7.1  GW  of  that  coming  from  diesel  plant.  Steam  plant  (8.9  GW),  gas  plant  (2.9  GW)  and  wind \nturbines  (0.1  GW)  make  up  the  balance.  The  General  Review  2006  estimated  total  generation  from  this  captive \ndiesel  plant  of  12,000  GWh  in  2004\u20132005.  CEA  does  not  include  smaller  diesel  plant  (less  than  1  MW)  in  its \nreview, but has verbally indicated it estimates an installed capacity of sub 1 MW diesel sets of 16\u201320 GW, running \nfor an average of 2 hours per day. \n\n4   2008  willingness  to  pay  estimates  for  domestic  consumers  were  Rs3.4/kWh  (West  region),  Rs2.8/kWh  (North \n\nregion), Rs5.1/kWh (Northeast region), Rs2.0/kWh (South region) and Rs1.0/kWh (East region).   \n\n5   Willingness  to  pay  estimates  for  industrial  consumers  were  Rs5.3/kWh  (West  region),  Rs6.0/kWh  (North  region), \nRs6.0/kWh  (Northeast  region),  Rs5.8/kWh  (South  region),  and  Rs6.0/kWh  (East  region).  Willingness  to  pay \nestimates  for  commercial  consumers  were  Rs4.3/kWh  (West  region),  Rs4.5/kWh  (North  region),  Rs2.5/kWh \n(Northeast  region),  Rs4.3/kWh  (South  region),  and  Rs3.7/kWh  (East  region).  Willingness  to  pay  estimates  for \ncommercial consumers were Rs4.3/kWh (West region), Rs4.5/kWh (North region), Rs2.5/kWh (Northeast region), \nRs4.3/kWh (South region), and Rs3.7/kWh (East region). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nF. \n \n15. \nThe basis for investment program economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and \ncosts  between  the  \u201cwith  program\u201d  scenario  and  the  \u201cwithout  program\u201d  scenario.  As  discussed \nabove, upstream generation and relevant downstream transmission and distribution costs were \nincluded in the analysis. A period of 25 years has been used for economic evaluation, including \nfive  years  of  capital  investment  and  construction.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place  in  the \nperiod  2008-2012,  and  benefits  are  assumed  to  be  realized  progressively  from  year  2009. \nResidual  values  were  estimated  for  equipment  on  the  basis  of  60  year  economic  life  for \nhydropower  assets,  50  years  for  POWERGRID  transmission,  40  years  for  state-level \ntransmission  and  distribution  and  30  years  for  thermal  plant.  Variable  generation  cost  is  zero \nuntil year 2013, before which time incremental thermal generation is lower in the \u201cwith program\u201d \ncase than the \u201cwithout program\u201d case (i.e. a resource cost saving).  \n \n16. \nThe  detailed  cost-benefit  calculations  show  that  the  overall  investment  program  during \nthe 11th Plan is economically viable, with an estimated EIRR of 13.1%. This is considered to be \na robust return given the size of the investment program considered. Economic cost and benefit \nflows for the investment program are shown in Table A10.2.  \n \n\nTable 10.2: EIRR Calculation \n \nCosts (Rs million)\n\nBenefits (Rs million)\nNon-\nIncremental\n\nIncremental\n\nCapital\nPOWERGRID\n\nState-Level\nTransmission\n\nVariable\n\nOperating\nFixed\n\nGeneration\n\nGeneration\n\nTransmission\nand Distribution\n\nGeneration\n\nOutput\n0\n23,824\n59,542\n82,502\n104,827\n161,912\n215,005\n261,971\n296,416\n326,253\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n354,365\n\nOutput\n0\n35,924\n93,159\n135,113\n179,746\n225,759\n264,073\n294,921\n328,881\n366,244\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n393,217\n\n0\n0\n495,750\n493,100\n345,300\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n(629,394)\n\nTransmission\n50,584\n84,988\n96,295\n91,627\n74,307\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n(218,791)\n\nand Distribution\n311,272\n300,407\n289,920\n279,800\n270,033\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n(635,002)\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n11,419\n66,529\n124,361\n158,008\n176,263\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n195,249\n\n0\n0\n0\n8,401\n15,123\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n19,547\n\nEIRR\n\n0\n5,428\n11,209\n17,002\n22,573\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n27,739\n\nNet\n\nBenefits\n(361,857)\n(331,075)\n(740,472)\n(672,315)\n(442,764)\n328,966\n365,264\n385,246\n420,003\n468,949\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n505,047\n1,988,233\n13.1%\n\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, T&D = transmission and distribution.\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates.\n \n17. \nEconomic  benefit  flow  is  financial  and  institutionally  sustainable.

Cost side risks include delay in program implementation, increases in capital and \noperating costs, and increases in state-level transmission and distribution costs. On the benefit \nsides, consumers\u2019 WTP is derived from the forecasts of their electricity demands in the coming \nyears.  If  the  country  experiences  significantly  lower  economic  growth  which  dampens  the \ndemand for electricity, consumers\u2019 WTP and the program benefits would be lower.    \n \n19. \nFor each of the risks identified, the sensitivity of the EIRR was tested, including capital \nand operating cost assumptions, willingness to pay values, and program timing. In all cases with \nthe exception of the combined scenario the EIRR exceeds 11.5%. Based on these results, the \noverall  investment  program  appears  to  be  economically  robust  and  delivers  acceptable \neconomic returns over a range of input assumptions. Results are show  in  Table  A10.3  below. \nNote that EIRR increases with increasing cost of generation as the resource cost saving benefit \noutweighs the additional generation cost to serve incremental consumption. \n \n\nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \n\nSensitivity Parameter\n\nVariation\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nBase case\nGeneral Capital Cost Increase\nState T&D Capital Cost Increase\nWTP Reduce\nCost of Generation Increase\nO&M Increase\nDelay\nCombined\n\nSwitching\nValue\n\n       9.2\n     18.7\n(13.3)\n(17.3)\n     77.0\n\nEIRR\n13.1\n11.9\n11.6\n12.3\n13.8\n13.0\n11.5\n10.2\n\n10\n25\n(10)\n10\n10\n1 year\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operations and maintenance; T&D = \ntransmission and distribution; WTP = willingness to pay.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n\n \n\nDistribution Analysis \n\n \nH. \n \n20. \nThe distribution of costs and benefits amongst stakeholders was assessed by comparing \nfinancial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits.

However,  as  the \nestimated average power sector financial return is less than 12%, it suffers a loss when its net \nfinancial benefit streams are discounted at 12%. On the other hand, the economy gains overall \nfrom  the  investment  program,  and  the  difference  between  the  financial  net  present  value  and \neconomic  net  present  value  (Rs  845  billion)  is  distributed  between  electricity  consumers, \nunskilled labor the government. From an economic perspective, benefits accrue to consumers \nas  energy  is  consumed  incrementally.  Some  of  the  benefit  of  resource  cost  savings  also \naccrues  to  consumers  as  more  expensive  energy  sources  are  displaced.    The  sum  of  these \nbenefits is greater than the incremental financial costs to consumers, and therefore consumers \nare  net  beneficiaries.  Government  of  India  is  a  net  beneficiary  due  to  reduction  in  imported \nenergy  costs  and  tax  revenues,  more  than  offsetting  the  loss  arising  from  the  over-valued \nexchange  rate.  Finally,  small  gains  are  made by  unskilled  labor  as  the  assumed wage  paid  is \nhigher than the willingness to work. \n \n\nTable A10.4: Distribution of Program Effects \n(Rs million) \n\nNPVs at 12%\n\nDistribution to Affected Groups\n\nItem\n\nEconomic\n\nFinancial\n\nDifference\n\nEconomy\n\nLabor\n\nPower\nSector\n\nBenefits\n  Incremental consumption\n  Resource cost saving\n  Power sector revenue\n\nCosts\n  Investment\n   Unskilled labor\n   Operation and maintenance\n\n        \n     \n\n819,404\n1,734,560\n0\n\n     \n\n1,944,996\n\n      \n819,404\n1,734,560\n   \n(1,944,996)\n\n           \n\n68,391\n\n     \n          \n        \n\n2,056,628\n54,955\n250,253\n\n     \n          \n        \n\n2,274,148\n73,274\n250,253\n\n(217,520)\n(18,318)\n0\n\n         \n\n217,520\n\n      \n\n18,318\n\n0\n\nElectricity \nConsumers\n\n        \n     \n\n819,404\n1,666,169\n(1,944,996)\n\n \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n        \n\n        \n\n        \n\n         \n\n18,318\n\n652,679\n\n844,806\n\n540,577\n\n652,679\n\n285,911\n\n192,128\n\nConclusion \n\nNet benefits\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \nI. \n \n22. \nThe  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  overall  11th  Plan  power  sector  investment \nprogram, of which POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program forms a part, is least cost and \nis economically viable. The analysis yields an EIRR of 13.1% Sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.

Project-I \u201cUpgradation of Transmission Capacity \nfrom Uttarakhand\u201d is to provide adequate transmission arrangement for evacuation and reliable \ntransfer of power generated from Tehri Valley in the state of Uttarakhand to constituents of the \nnorthern  region.  Project-II  \u201c\u00b1800kV  High  Voltage  Direct  Current  (HVDC)  Northeastern  \u2013 \nNorthern/Western  Inter-connector  \u201d  aims  to  deliver  bulk  power  generated  from  hydro  power \nstations  in  the  northeastern  region  to  the  power  deficit  regions  of  the  northern  region  and  the \nwestern region through construction of about 1,800km of \u00b1800kV HVDC transmission systems. \nThese  projects  have  been  proposed  for  ADB  funding  due  to  (i)  their  project  readiness;  (ii)  the \nneed to dovetail transmission system development with associated generation projects and; (iii) \ntheir  innovativeness  of  introducing  the  state-of-the-art  high  voltage  transmission  technology. \nThe Investment Program will have two projects for the funding under the Facility. \n \n\n1. \n\nProject 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity from Uttarakhand. \n\n \nThis project is to provide adequate transmission arrangement for evacuation and reliable \n2. \ntransfer of power generated from Tehri Valley in the state of Uttarakhand to constituents of the \nNorthern Region, by establishment of 765/400kV, 10 x 500 MVA transmission capacity each at \nTehri Pooling Station and Meerut within the existing site, construction of 103km of loop-in-loop-\nout  (LILO)  of  Bareilly  \u2013  Mandaula  400kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  at  Meerut  (54km  of \nloop-in and 49km of loop-out), and modification of series capacitors for operation at 765kV level. \nADB funding is proposed for sub-stations only. \n\n2. \n\nProject  2:  \u00b1800kV  High  Voltage  Direct  Current  (HVDC)  Northeastern  \u2013 \nNorthern/Western Inter-connector. \n\n \n3. \nThis  project  aims  to  deliver  bulk  power  generated  from  hydro  power  stations  in  the \nNorth-eastern region to the power deficit regions of the Northern region and the Western region \nthrough construction of about 1,800km of \u00b1800kV HVDC transmission systems from Biswanath \nChariyali  to  Agra  including  800kV  converting  and  inverting  stations  at  both  ends,  and \nconstruction of 400kV connecting transmission lines at Biswanath Chariyali for transfer of power \nfrom  various  power  plants  in  the  North-eastern  region.  ADB  funding  is  proposed  for  \u00b1800kV \nHVDC transmission lines only.  \n\ninvestigation/survey  has  been  carried  out \n\n4. \nThe length of Biswanath Chariyali to Agra + 800 kV, 6000 MW HVDC bi-pole line is too \nto \nlong.

The  Project,  by \nfocusing  on  strengthening  and  expansion  of  the  interregional  and  intraregional  transmission  systems  of  the  Power \nGrid  Corporation  of  India,  Limited  (POWERGRID),  is  expected  to  reduce  system  losses,  which  in  turn  will  improve \nfrequency and voltage levels, and ultimately reduce wear on electrical equipment. This will lead to more efficient use \nof resources and make more power available to increase electrification outreach. In addition, it will facilitate efficient \nutilization  of  existing  and  planned  power  plants.  The  strengthening  of  the  sector  in  the  selected  states  will  result  in \nefficient  delivery  of  services  to  consumers.  Profitability  and  efficiency  in  the  farming  as  well  as  other  sectors  is \nexpected to improve with improvements in quality and reliability of power supply with effective restructuring. For the \npoor, employment opportunities are expected to increase due to the civil works.  \n\n \nNA \n\n   \n\n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project is expected to result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. The improved frequency and voltage \nwill boost the industry and agriculture sectors, leading to enhanced production and improved economic development. \nNo direct impact on poverty is expected, considering that this project will strengthen the interregional grid. \n \nThe  sample  subprojects  will  create  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during  their \nimplementation. Unskilled labor  will  be employed directly for the construction of transmission lines, substations, and \nother manual works. There will also be the opportunity for employment for the post-construction phase, especially for \nmaintenance. \n \n \nC.         Participation Process \n \nIs there a stake holder analysis? Yes  \n \n\n \n\nParticipation  during  project  preparation.  Since  no  impact  and  no  direct  beneficiaries  are  expected  due  to  the \nimplementation of the first tranche, nonstakeholder analysis was undertaken. Nevertheless, POWERGRID, under the \nfuture  tranches,  will  undertake  a  full  social  assessment  of  all  the  stakeholders  which  will  include  consultations  with \nlocal  officials  and  village  leaders  and  all  the  affected  communities.  This  approach  is  expected  to  raise  the  level  of \nawareness, build local support, and enable affected people to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and \nimplementation. The poor, women, and other vulnerable groups will be carefully considered in conducting participatory \nactivities. As part of the social assessment, stakeholder consultations in the project areas will be carried out with the \nbroad objective of ensuring extensive participation of all types of stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participatory strategy? Yes \n \nParticipation  and  consultation  are  based  on  a  two-way  information  flow,  from  project  authorities  to  people  and  from \npeople to project authorities. Participation, consultation, and information dissemination will be incorporated at several \nlevels  during  planning  of  subprojects  under  future  tranches.  As  part  of  the  project  preparation,  to  ensure  that \ncommunity support is obtained and the project supports the needs of the affected persons; public consultations were \ncarried  out  as  an  integral  component.  Continuous  involvement  of  the  stakeholders  and  the  affected  community  was \nobtained.  The  feedback  received  from  the  consultation  brought  substantial  inputs  into  the  project  preparation. \nInteracting with people and eliciting feedback allows affected populations to influence the decision-making process by \nraising issues that should be considered in design, mitigation, monitoring, and management plans and the analysis of \nalternatives.  The  Executing  Agency  will  ensure  that  essential  participation  focuses  will  be  adhered  to  during \nimplementation. These will involve local groups in (i) preparing final compensation listings and individual claim files; (ii) \nthe  payment  of  compensation  for  acquired  land  and  loss  of  assets  and  livelihood;  (iii)  participation  in  any  grievance \nredress; and (iv) participation in the monitoring and evaluation process during implementation of the resettlement plan. \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nGender and Development  \n\n \nD. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \nThe poor and women will be carefully considered when conducting participatory activities.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
