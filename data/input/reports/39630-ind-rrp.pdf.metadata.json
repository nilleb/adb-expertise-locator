This policy, Power for \nAll by 2012, will require additional generation capacity of 78,600 \nmegawatts  (MW)  during  the  period  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FY2008\u2013FY2012).  \nThe Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) adopted by the Government in \n2006 specifies certain regulatory measures for (i) optimizing the \npower supply mix through greater use of indigenous hydropower \nresources and renewable energy, (ii) pursuing technologies that \nmaximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing the ongoing power \nreforms to control technical and commercial losses. In particular, \nthe IEP aims to change the current hydro-thermal energy ratio of \n25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not \nless than 10% of the generation base by 2012. The nationwide \nenergy efficiency potential (including cogeneration) is estimated at \nover 20,000 MW, but the realization of this potential will require \nrobust regulatory incentives on behalf of the Government.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) energy sector program \nfor  India  aims  at  enhancing  the  impact  of  the  Government\u2019s \ninitiatives  and  includes  both  demand-  and  supply-related \nprograms.  The  planned  activities  include  (i)  renovation  and \nmodernization of existing hydropower and thermal power plants, \n(ii) upgrade of inefficient thermal power plants to enhance their \nperformance,  (iii)  development  of  renewable  and  alternative \nenergy sources, (iv) reduction of technical and commercial losses \nin transmission and distribution networks and facilities, and (v) \nbringing demand-side management and energy conservation into \nthe  mainstream  while  ensuring  environmental  and  social \nsustainability. The recently launched ADB Carbon Market Initiative\nand Energy Efficiency Initiative will leverage additional resources \n ", "ii   \nto  accelerate  the  promotion  of  energy  efficiency,  renewable \nenergy, and  other  forms of clean energy in India. As natural \nenergy resources are unevenly distributed and often located far \nfrom  the  load  centers,  the  additional  generation  capacity  will \nrequire the development of an adequate intrastate and interstate \ntransmission  system  to  ensure  reliable  and  secure  delivery  of \npower from generation plants to end users. The Central Electricity \nAuthority (CEA) has developed the National Electricity Plan, and \nthis is to be used as a basis of investment plans to be prepared by \nprospective  generating  companies  and  transmission  and \ndistribution licensees at the central and state level. \n   \nPower Transmission Sector. The Indian power system is divided \ninto  five  regions\u2014northern,  southern,  western,  eastern,  and \nnortheastern. Except for the eastern and northeastern regions, all \nthe regions are presently facing power shortages in the range of \nabout  300\u20136,000  MW.  Considering  the  generation  addition \nprogram  up  to  FY2012,  the  maximum  surplus  power  in  the \neastern region is expected to be around 12,000 MW and in the \nnortheastern  region  around  3,000  MW;  however,  the  northern, \nwestern, and southern regions will need to import power to a large \nextent from the northeastern and eastern regions to reduce their \ndeficit situation.  Therefore,  development  of  strong  interregional \nlinks connecting the northeastern and eastern regions to all other \nregions is needed.  \n \nWhile the state governments are responsible for the intrastate \ntransmission system, the Government is focusing on the creation \nof a national grid in a phased manner by adding over 60,000 \ncircuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission network by 2012. This will \nenable the integrated grid to transmit an additional 78,600 MW \nand carry 60% of the power generated in the country, increasing \ninterregional power transfer capacity from 14,100 MW in March \n2007  to  more  than  37,000  MW.  For  this  purpose,  capital \ninvestment of about $18.75 billion will be required during the 11th \nFive-Year  Plan  to  (i)  strengthen  regional  grids,  (ii)  increase \ninterregional capacity, and (iii) establish a unified load dispatch \nscheme. \n \nPower Grid Corporation of India Ltd. Power Grid Corporation of \nIndia Ltd (POWERGRID), the central transmission utility tasked \nwith  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  national \ntransmission grid, will be responsible for investing $13.75 billion \nduring the plan period. The balance of $5 billion is expected from \nthe  private  sector.  To  achieve  its  mission,  POWERGRID  has \ndeveloped  a  long-term  corporate  strategic  plan  for  the  period \n2003\u20132012.  The  strategy  covers  various  areas  including  (i) \ncontract management, (ii) project implementation and monitoring, \n(iii)  operation  and  maintenance,  (iv)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards,  (v)  corporate  governance,  (vi)  technology \ndevelopment,  (vi)  information  technology,  (vii)  human  resource \n ", "  iii\nmanagement, (viii) cost reduction, (ix) fund mobilization, and (x) \nbusiness process reengineering. While POWERGRID already has \nsufficient institutional capacity to implement the strategy, it has \nbeen  implementing  capacity-development  initiatives  including \ntraining programs for executives, managers, and line workers in \nspecialized areas.  The  capacity-development  program  is  being \nfinanced through internal resources. \n \nSector Road Map and  Policy  Environment.  The  Electricity  Act  2003  provides  a \nInvestment Program  complete legal framework for implementing the reforms, including \nDescription  (i)  the  unbundling  of  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs),  (ii)  the \nestablishment  of  state  regulators,  (iii)  licensing,  and  (iv)  an \nantitheft  provision.  So  far,  23  state  electricity  regulatory \ncommissions  have  been  constituted  and  16  states  have \nunbundled and or corporatized their SEBs. The Electricity Act also \nrepresents a departure from the previous regime of the power \nsector by introducing more competition into the wholesale market \nin addition to retail markets. Certain provisions in the Electricity \nAct, such as (i) open access to the transmission and distribution \nnetwork, (ii) recognition of power trading as a distinct activity, and \n(iii) the liberal definition of a captive generating plant, have already \nstarted  to  introduce  and  encourage  competition  in  the  power \nsector. Under the Electricity Act, 18 states have issued open-\naccess guidelines. \n \nTransmission Sector Road Map. The 11th Five-Year Plan aims \nto further accelerate the reforms and underpins the Government\u2019s \nmission  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  through  (i)  expanding  the \ncoverage,  (ii)  improving  the  reliability,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the \nsustainability and efficiency of the interstate transmission network. \nExpected outcomes and major milestones of the plan are defined \nin  the  transmission  sector  road  map.  The  sector  road  map \nincludes specific technical targets to be achieved by 2012 in terms \nof  expansion  of  the  national  power  grid  and  reliability  and \nefficiency of the grid operations. As POWERGRID is the primary \nprovider of interstate and interregional transmission services, the \nsector road map also includes various measures based on its \nlong-term corporate strategy to further strengthen POWERGRID\u2019s \ninstitutional  capacity  to  achieve  the  technical  targets.  These \nmeasures  aim  to  strengthen  corporate  governance,  improve \nefficiencies,  and  enhance  financial  viability  of  POWERGRID \nthrough (i) financial management, (ii) safeguard compliance, (iii) \nhuman resource management, (iv) information technology, and (v) \ncost reduction. \n \nInvestment Program. The proposed investment program is part \nof the $13.75 billion investment plan of POWERGRID and will \nprimarily  have  two  projects  for  ADB  funding.  Project  1 \n(Upgradation  of  Transmission  Capacity  from  Uttarakhand)  will \nprovide transmission arrangement for the evacuation and reliable \ntransfer of hydropower generated in the Tehri Valley in the state of \n ", "iv   \nUttarakhand to the northern region. Project 2 (\u00b1800 kilovolt [kV] \nHigh  Voltage  Direct  Current  [HVDC]  Northeastern\u2013\nNorthern/Western  Interconnector)  aims  to  deliver  bulk  power \ngenerated from hydropower stations in the northeastern region to \nthe power-deficit areas of the northern and western regions. Other \nprojects may be added, if necessary. \n \n  The investment program is estimated to cost the equivalent of \nabout $2.542 billion including taxes, duties, and interest and other \ncharges  on  the  loans  during  construction.  POWERGRID  has \nrequested financing of up to the equivalent of $600 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources under the sovereign-guaranteed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  POWERGRID  has  also \nrequested a $400 million nonsovereign loan.  \n \nClean Energy and Energy Efficiency. Projects 1 and 2 under \nthe proposed investment program will improve the overall power \nsystem  efficiency  in  the  northern  and  western  regions  by \nestablishing adequate high-efficiency transmission infrastructure \nwith a planned transmission capacity enhancement of 4,500 MW. \nThe  efficiency  improvements  will  result  from  upgrading  the \ntransmission network in Uttarakhand and the use of \u00b1800 HVDC \ntechnology for transmission of bulk power over a long distance \n(1,800 kilometers [km]) within the northeastern\u2013northern/western \ninterconnecting corridor.  \n \nThe  huge  advantage  of  the  HVDC  technology  is  its  ability  to \ntransmit large amounts of power over long distances with much \nlower  technical  losses  than  alternating  current  (AC)  systems. \nLosses in HVDC lines are quoted at as low as 3% per 1,000 km. \nBy  2012,  upon  the  completion  of  two  associated  hydropower \nfacilities with a combined capacity of 2,600 MW, the reduction in \ntransmission  losses  alone  will  bring  about  228  gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)  of  clean  electricity  transmitted  annually  through  the \nnortheastern\u2013northern/western interconnecting corridor. In 2015, \nwhen extra hydropower capacity of 3,000 MW comes online, the \nreduced transmission losses will result in 491 GWh of additional \nelectrical energy per year. In addition, the planned HVDC link will \nnot only transmit excess electricity from the northeastern grid to \nthe capacity-deficient northern and western grids, but also make \npossible the realization of supply-side energy efficiency, which is \nnot  achievable  in  the  case  of  conventional  AC  transmission \nsystems.  The  efficiency  gains  come  from  the  ability  of  HVDC \nsystems to allow a quick change in the direction of power flow \n(bidirectionality).  This  will  permit  (i)  the  meeting  of  peak-load \nneeds and provision of emergency power into the northern and \nwestern  grids  when  fossil-fuel  plants  go  offline  unexpectedly \n(peak-shaving  load  management),  and  (ii)  storage  of  off-peak \npower from thermal facilities which are not easily cycled (valley-\nfilling load management). \n ", "  v\nThe proposed investment program also will generate substantial \nenvironmental  benefits relating  to  the  reduction  of  greenhouse \ngases  and  other  pollutants.  The  projects  planned  under  the \ninvestment program will allow avoiding the expansion of thermal \npower generation in the Northern and Western regions through \nenabling the transmission of hydropower from the Northeastern \nregion of India. ADB estimates that hydropower plants associated \nwith Project 1 will offset more than 263 million tons (t) of CO  \n2\nequivalent,  and  with  Project  2  the  figure  is  551  million  t. \nFurthermore, additional cumulative offsets gained from reduced \ntransmission losses will account for 7 million (t) of CO  equivalent \n2\nover the lifetime of the project. \n \nMultitranche Financing  The financing will be provided under the MFF, in accordance with \nFacility  ADB policy.1 The MFF will extend multiple loans of no less than \n$100  million  to  finance  part  of  the  costs  of  the  two  projects \nconstituting the investment program. Additional projects may be \nadded if necessary. These will be subject to submission of related \nperiodic financing requests (PFRs) by POWERGRID and India, \nand execution of the related loan and guarantee agreements.  \n \nThe  provisions  of  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility will apply to each loan, subject to modifications, if \nany,  that  might  be  included  under  each  loan  agreement.  The \nspecific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility.  \n \nRationale  The investment program will (i) provide long-term and predictable \nfinancing for POWERGRID\u2019s huge investment requirements; (ii) \nreduce 821 million t of carbon dioxide (CO )-equivalent emissions \n2\nover the lifetime of two proposed projects primarily by replacing \nthermal  generation  at  the  demand  site  with  transmitted,  clean \nhydropower;  (iii)  help  POWERGRID  implement  its  capacity-\ndevelopment program under the corporate strategic plan; (iv) help \nPOWERGRID  prepare  for  external  commercial  borrowing  to \nbroaden and deepen its access to financial markets; (v) introduce \nbest  practices,  such  as  state-of-the-art  HVDC  transmission \ntechnologies;  and  (vi)  ensure  sound  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies are followed. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The investment program is expected to promote sustained social \nand  economic  prosperity  and  growth  in  India  by  providing \nadequate  and  reliable  power  supply.  Inadequate  supply  of \nelectricity has been a major hindrance to economic growth in the \ncountry, affecting all consumer groups and social classes. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

This will cover payment for substation \ncontract  packages  of  Project  1  and  transmission  line  contract \npackages of Project 2. The first PFR is presented to ADB\u2019s Board \nof Directors together with this document and the FFA. The loan \nwill have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. It \nwill have an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear on the full undisbursed amount, and such other terms and \nconditions as set out in the related  loan agreement.  \n   \n  India will provide irrevocable sovereign guarantee(s), in form and \nsubstance acceptable to ADB for the term of each loan, as a \ncondition  precedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  each  tranche \nrequested by POWERGRID, and provided by ADB pursuant to the \nterms of the loan agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  Each PFR will result in a separate loan agreement, which will \ndescribe  the  detailed  disbursement  arrangements  agreed \nbetween POWERGRID and ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon by POWERGRID and \nADB. No imprest account will be required for disbursement under \nthe facility. \n   \nAdvance Contracting and  For  each  project,  advance  contracting  for  procurement  of \nRetroactive Financing  equipment and civil works will be allowed, subject to these being \neligible according to agreed procedures, and ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nRetroactive financing may be available under individual loans for \nexpenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to the signing of the \ncorresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling up to 20% of the \nloan amount. POWERGRID has been informed that approval of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to financing any of the proposed projects. \n   \nAvailability Period  The availability period will be for 7 years from March 2008 to \nMarch 2015, with the last PFR to be submitted by the end of 2013. \nEach specific loan will have its own closing date to match its \nimplementation period.  \n   \n ", "viii  \nExecuting Agency  Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.  \n   \nImplementation  POWERGRID will be responsible for the implementation of the \nArrangements  investment program and its individual projects as per the loan \nagreements. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services for the Investment Program \nwill be carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Supply of materials will be on the basis of international \ncompetitive bidding.  \n   \nInvestment Program  The investment program is designed to benefit all grid-connected \nBenefits and  consumers with adequate and reliable supply of electricity and is \nBeneficiaries  expected to support the achievements of the Government\u2019s goal \nof Power for All by 2012 by increasing transmission capacity and \nenhancing  the  reliability  and  efficiency  of  the  transmission \nnetwork.  Reliable  power  supply  through  the  expansion  and \naugmentation of the national transmission grid will remove the \nhindrance to economic growth in India caused by an unstable \nelectricity supply. \n \nThe investment program will also help reduce 821 million t2 of \nCO -equivalent  emissions,  primarily  by  replacing  thermal \n2\ngeneration  at  demand  sites  with  transmitted,  nonpolluting \nhydropower. \n \n  The  investment  program  will  help  enhance  the  commercial \nviability of POWERGRID by providing long-term funding support \nfor its immediate investments and promoting various measures to \nstrengthen  corporate  governance  and  improve  operational \nefficiencies. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Key  assumptions  are  that  (i)  the  Government  will  remain \ncommitted  to  power  sector  reforms  and  development  of  the \nnational  electricity  market,  (ii)  the  Electricity  Act  2003  will  be \nimplemented  in  a  timely  and  transparent  manner,  and  (iii) \nmacroeconomic growth will remain stable. \n   \n  POWERGRID  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  from  SEBs,  which \nessentially handle retail distribution of electricity in India. While the \ncost-plus tariff structure in India allows all debt servicing, foreign \nexchange  losses,  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs  to  be \npassed on, there may be a possibility of reduction in the return on \nequity guaranteed to POWERGRID. These risks may impact on \nthe  cash  flow  of  POWERGRID  and  implementation  of  the \ninvestment program. However, such risks appear to be low given \nPOWERGRID\u2019s strong financial position and stringent payment \ndiscipline for SEBs introduced in 2003.  \n   \n                                                 \n2 ADB estimates. \n ", "  ix\n  Other  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  (i)  delay  in \nassociated generation investments, (ii) an increase in the price of \nmaterials, and (iii) failure to meet safeguard requirements in a \ntimely manner.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (the Facility) to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (POWERGRID), \nguaranteed by India, for the National Power Grid Development Investment Program. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Sector Overview \n \n2.  Balanced infrastructure development is a major challenge for India to overcome if it is to \nachieve its sustainable economic growth target of 8\u20139% annually over the next 25 years. Given \ninfrastructure inadequacies now exist in both rural and urban areas, preliminary exercises by the \nGovernment of India indicate that investment in infrastructure will need to increase from 4.6% of \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  between  7%  and  8%  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  period. \nDevelopment needs in the power sector are vast; India\u2019s need for power is growing rapidly with \nconsumption increasing by about 64% over the last 10 years. The forecast growth in electricity \ndemand to support a GDP growth rate of about 9% is expected to be 8%. This is higher than the \nlast 10 years, as the energy-intensive manufacturing sector is expected to increase its share of \nGDP. However, electricity is still inaccessible to the majority of households. While over 80% of \nvillages are already electrified, only 44% of total households have access to electricity, and in the \nrural areas only 33% of households have access to electricity. As of 31 March 2005, per capita \nelectricity consumption stood at about 606 kilowatt-hours (kWh) annually.  \n  \n3.  Energy  and  peaking  shortage  are  high,  with  frequent  load  shedding  (rationing)  and \nsignificant  voltage  fluctuation  at  metered  consumer  levels.  This  undermines  industrial \ncompetitiveness and severely constrains economic growth. The major reasons for inadequate, \nerratic,  and  unreliable  power  supply  especially  at  the    state  level  are  (i)  inadequate  power \ngeneration capacity, (ii) lack of optimum utilization of the existing generation capacity, (iii) an \ninadequate and aging subtransmission and distribution network, (iv) large scale theft and a skewed \ntariff structure, (v) slow pace of rural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity by the end \nconsumer. \n \n4.  In India, aggregate technical and commercial [AT&C] losses are quite high arising mainly \nfrom distribution losses, unmetered connections, theft, and subsidies to agricultural consumers. \nNationwide AT&C losses amount to as much as 40%, compared to the world average of 10\u201315%, \nwhile some states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat have shown remarkable \nimprovement in reducing AT&C losses. The operational inefficiencies represented by such high \nAT&C losses, combined with retail tariffs set far below the cost of supply, have resulted in a \ndeterioration of the financial health of state electricity boards (SEBs). Despite the Government\u2019s \nefforts to create enabling and encouraging policy and regulatory framework, poor creditworthiness \nof SEB remains a major hindrance to private sector investment in some states.  \n \n5.  In  line  with  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  Act  1998,  the  Central  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (CERC) was established in 1998, and has full authority to determine bulk \ntariffs. The 1998 act enables state governments to establish state electricity regulatory commissions \nwith jurisdiction over state power utilities. CERC regulates interstate, regional, and interregional \ntransmission, while the 23 state electricity regulatory commissions regulate state transmission and \n ", "2   \ndistribution. State and central regulatory commissions have powers to (i) grant, amend, and revoke \nlicenses; (ii) regulate the performance of licensees; (iii) determine tariffs; (iv) safeguard consumers' \ninterests while ensuring cost recovery of electricity; (v) promote development of markets, including \ntrading; and (vi) rationalize electricity tariffs by making subsidies transparent. \n \n6.  To further accelerate the sector reforms, the Government enacted the Electricity Act 2003, \nwhich came into force in June 2003. The Electricity Act provides for a complete legal framework for \nimplementing the reforms, including (i) the unbundling of SEBs, (ii) establishment of the state \nregulator, (iii) licensing, and (iv) an anti-theft provision. The Act also represents a departure from \nthe previous power sector regime by introducing more competition into wholesale as well as retail \nmarkets. Certain provisions in the Electricity Act, such as (i) open access to the transmission and \ndistribution  network,  (ii)  recognition  of  power  trading  as  a  distinct  activity,  and  (iii)  the  liberal \ndefinition of a captive generating plant, are expected to introduce and encourage competition in the \npower sector. Under the Electricity Act, 18 states have issued open-access guidelines. \n \n  2.  Sector Strategy and Policy \n \n7.  Cognizant of the pivotal role the power sector plays in development for economic growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  confirmed  its  mission  to  provide  electricity  to  all \nhouseholds at an affordable price by 2012. This goal of Power for All by 2012 has been elaborated \ninto subsector-specific policies in the National Electricity Policy, which was prepared in February \n2005 in accordance with the Electricity Act 2003. The Government has set ambitious energy policy \nobjectives to achieve annual generation capacity of 1,000 kWh per capita by 2012. The magnitude \nof investment needed to achieve this goal is vast. Net capacity addition of 78,600 megawatts (MW) \nwill be required under the 11th Five-Year Plan period.  \n 8.  Integrated Energy Policy. The Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) adopted by the Government \nin 2006 specifies certain regulatory measures for (i) optimizing the power supply mix through \ngreater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy, (ii) pursuing technologies \nthat maximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing the ongoing power reforms to control technical \nand commercial losses. The Government is endeavoring to turn the IEP targets into tangible \noutcomes through the provision of incentives for investors in order to overcome such challenges as \n(i) the perceived advantages of capital investment in everyday technology, (ii) smaller project sizes \nresulting  in  higher  transaction  costs  of  project  preparation,  and  (iii)  the  lack  of  institutional \ncapacities. In particular, the IEP aims to change the hydro-thermal energy ratio from the current \n25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not less than 10% of the generation \nbase, by 2012. The nationwide energy efficiency potential (including cogeneration) is estimated at \nover 20,000 MW, but the realization of this potential will require robust regulatory incentives from \nthe Government.  \n    \n9.  Generation. Coal fuel will continue to dominate power production in India in the near future, \nas the country attempts to increase its generation capacity to keep up with growing industrial and \nresidential power demand. India will continue to emphasize the development of large-scale pithead \ncoal-fired plants to take advantage of domestic coal resources rather than increase fossil-fuel \nenergy imports. However, the Government is endeavoring to minimize environmental impacts by \nusing state-of-the-art technologies and continuing the development of clean and renewable sources \nof energy such as the untapped hydropower potential in the northeastern and northern regions.  \n10.  The thermal-hydro ratio was close to 50:50 in the early 1960s, partly because the early \neconomic development policy emphasized support for agriculture, which has extensive irrigation \ndemands. Industrial development became a priority in the 1960s, when new thermal plants became \ndominant. By 2003, for a variety of reasons, the Government recognized the need to increase the \n ", "    3  \nhydropower proportion and introduced an initiative to develop up to about 50,000 MW of new \nhydropower capacity as part of the Power for All by 2012 policy. The Ministry of Power (MOP) \nconducted preliminary feasibility studies on about 300 candidate sites, and identified over 30,000 \nMW of potential hydropower that could be commercially developed (based on an estimated 1st-year \ntariff of Rs. 2 per kWh or less). MOP has implemented several policy measures to accelerate \nhydropower development, including the streamlining of the project approval process and a review of \ntariff policies.  \n11.  Transmission. As natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and often located far \nfrom the load centers, additional generation capacity will require development of an adequate \nintrastate and interstate transmission system to ensure reliable and secure delivery of power. The \nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) has developed the National Electricity Plan, which is to be used \nas  a  basis  for  investment  plans  to  be  prepared  by  prospective  generating  companies  and \ntransmission  and  distribution  licensees  at  the  central  and  state  level.  In  line  with  the  plan, \nPOWERGRID is tasked to develop the national power grid to provide adequate infrastructure for \ninterstate transmission of power so as to ensure that underutilized generation capacity is used and \nthe power is transmitted to deficit regions. The transmission sector can play a pivotal role in \nimplementing the IEP by (i) ensuring regional energy security with a transnational grid, enabling the \nregion to avoid overdependence on fossil-fuel energy resources; (ii) reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions by connecting hydropower and renewable energy power plants to the load centers; and \n(iii) enhancing energy efficiency through technical loss reduction using advanced technologies.  \n \n12.  Distribution. The major weakness of the power sector is on the distribution side, which is \nentirely  the  domain  of  the  states.  Restoring  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector  through  the \nrestructure of the state utilities (while still safeguarding consumer interests) is a major challenge. \nConsequently, the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program (APDRP) was initiated in \n2001 to introduce reforms at the distribution level with an overall objective of reducing AT&C losses \nto 15% by 2007. While metering on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders has improved from 81% in 2001 to 96% \nin 2006, and consumer metering has improved from 78% to 92% in the same period, average \nAT&C losses are still close to 50%, which the Government aims to reduce to 15% by the end of the \n11th Five-Year Plan period. In addition to financial support under the APDRP, many states have \nunbundled  their  SEBs  to  put  distribution  companies  under  regulatory  oversight  for  efficiency \nimprovements.  The  Government  encourages  private  sector  participation  in  distribution  through \nprivatization and franchising. \n \n  3.  Power Grid Corporation of India, Limited \n \n13.  POWERGRID was established in October 1989 and became fully operational in 1992. It is \nresponsible  for  developing,  operating,  and  maintaining  the  national  transmission  grid,  which \nincludes  interstate  and  interregional  transmission  lines.  Prior  to  its  formation,  central  sector \ngenerating companies constructed and operated their own transmission facilities to supply and \ndistribute power from their power plants. As a result, the national transmission system has evolved \nin a rather haphazard manner, resulting in transmission bottlenecks in many areas; most regions \nare not fully synchronized with each other and there are limited transfers of power. \n \n14.  As of December 2007, POWERGRID operates and maintains one of the largest extra-high \nvoltage transmission networks in the world, with about 65,000 circuit kilometers (ckm) of extra-high \nvoltage lines, along with 110 substations with transmission capacity of about 66,000 megavolt-\namperes (MVA) and carries about 45% of generated power across the country through its national \ntransmission grid. The national grid has an interregional capacity of 17,000 MW as of December \n2007, which is planned to be increased to more than 37,000 MW by the end of 2012. POWERGRID \n ", "4   \nowns and operates five state-of-the-art regional load dispatch centers and is implementing the \nNational Load Dispatch Center to integrate them. \n \n15.  POWERGRID has achieved remarkable growth since it started commercial operations in \n1992 and has demonstrated high productivity among major transmission companies in the world. Its \nsystem availability was above 99% in FY2007 and technical loss level is reported at 3\u20134%, which is \ncomparable with international standards. POWERGRID played a major role in implementing the \navailability-based tariffs in the country, which helped stabilize vital grid parameters such as voltage \nand frequency to prevent tripping. POWERGRID has also invested in modernizing regional load \ndispatch  centers,  which  has  also  improved  operating  efficiency  of  the  transmission  system. \nPOWERGRID has developed into a well-respected public sector enterprise, which attracts highly \nqualified staff who are employing international standards of design, engineering, construction, and \noperations. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges and Opportunities of the Power Transmission Sector \n \n16.  Prior  to  1992  when  POWERGRID  became  fully  operational,  central  sector  generating \ncompanies constructed and operated the transmission facilities to distribute power from their power \nplants and transmit it to client SEBs. At that time, the generation and transmission system in the \ncountry  was  planned  and  developed  on  the  basis  of  regional  self-sufficiency.  Interregional \ntransmission arrangements were envisaged only for transfer of intermittent operational surpluses of \nsmall magnitude. With the formation of strong regional grid systems, the focus was shifted to \nplanning on an all-India basis and for a free flow of electricity across the whole country through a \nstrong national power grid. \n \n17.  The Indian power system is divided into five electrical regions\u2014northern, southern, western, \neastern, and northeastern. Except for the eastern and northeastern regions, all the regions are \npresently facing power shortages in the range of about 300\u20136,000 MW. Considering the generation \naddition program up to FY2012, the maximum surplus power in the eastern region is expected to be \nin  the  range  of  12,000  MW  and  in  the  northeastern  region  around  3,000  MW;  however,  the \nnorthern, western, and southern regions will need to import power to a large extent from the \nnortheastern and eastern regions to alleviate their deficits.  \n \n18.  The transmission sector has a great opportunity to enhance energy efficiency and minimize \nenvironmental  impacts,  as  well  as  improve  regional  energy  security,  by  developing  advanced \nnational and transnational grids with cutting-edge technologies such as high voltage direct current \n(HVDC) for connecting the load centers to hydropower and renewable energy power plants in India \nand neighboring countries. State-of-the-art technology will be needed to transfer power with minimal \nlosses and under right-of-way constraints from the resource-rich northeastern and eastern regions \nto distant load centers in the northern and western regions.  \n \n  2.  Sector Investment and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The development agenda for the transmission sector is twofold. At the state level, where \nSEBs are responsible, strengthening and modernization of the intrastate transmission system is \nimmediately needed to reduce technical losses and enhance reliability of state grids. At the central \nlevel, where POWERGRID is the  primary provider of transmission service, transmission capacity \nexpansion between states and regions is a major challenge for optimizing the use of the country\u2019s \nenergy resources, and one which will require enormous investment. According to the least-cost \n ", "    5  \ngeneration expansion program and demand projection for different regions, the northeastern and \neastern region will be the major power exporter for other regions. Therefore, development of strong \ninterregional links interconnecting the northeastern and eastern regions to all other regions are \nneeded. By 2012, the eastern, western, and northern regions will be interconnected by a high \ncapacity 765 kV ring, while the southern region will remain interconnected in asynchronous mode. \nThe northeastern region is also expected to be connected with the eastern region by a high-\ncapacity 400kV alternating current (AC) link and with the northern and western regions by a high-\ncapacity 800kV high voltage direct current (HVDC) link. This will constitute a stronger national \npower grid with high-capacity transmission. \n \n20.  At the central level, the Government, therefore, is focusing on the creation of a national grid \nin a phased manner by adding over 60,000 ckm of transmission network by 2012 so that the \nintegrated grid can handle an additional 78,600 MW and carry 60% of the power generated in the \ncountry, increasing interregional power transfer capacity from 14,100 MW in March 2007 to more \nthan 37,000 MW. For this purpose, capital investment of about $18.75 billion will be required during \nthe 11th Five-Year Plan period to (i) strengthen regional grids, (ii) increase interregional capacity, \nand (iii) establish a unified load dispatch scheme. Out of this, investment of $13.75 billion will be \nmade  by  POWERGRID  for  its  own  facilities  and  the  balance  of  $5  billion  will  be  mainly  for \ngeneration-linked transmission projects to be constructed and owned either privately or through \npublic-private partnership. POWERGRID may participate in the projects jointly with private sector \ninvestors. The investment and financing plan during the 11th Five-Year Plan period is shown in the \nFigure. \n11th Five-Year Plan and Financing Plan\n(FY2008-FY2012)\nInvestment Plan Financing Plan\nAmount Amount\n($ million) ($ million)\nGeneration-Linked Projects    1 2,947 ADB       6 00\nPublic Sector  Foreign Borrowingsa/Supplier's Credit    3 ,150\nGrid-Strengthening Projects      3 ,637 POWERGRID  Projects Bonds / Domestic Loans    5 ,875\nInternal Resources    4 ,125\nInterregional/Intercountry Link      2 ,022 of which JV Investment from POWERGRID     ( 107)\nPublic\u2013Private \nULDC and Others         1 44 Private  Partnership (JV)\nSector  Independent  Private Sector Financing    5 ,000\nInvestment  Transmission \nCompanies\nTotal    1 8,750 Total  1 8,750\nADB = Asian Development Bank, JV = joint venture, POWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., ULDC = United Load Dispatch Center.\na Including $400 million nonsovereign loan from ADB and other multilateral and bilateral sources.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n \n \n3.  Policy Dialogue \n \n21.  Private Sector Participation. The Government amended Indian Electricity Laws to enable \nprivate sector participation in transmission sector. In January 2000, the Government issued detailed \nguidelines. The guidelines envisage two routes for inviting private sector investment. One route is \nthrough joint venture of central transmission utility / state transmission utility and private sector.  \nThe first joint venture has been established by POWERGRID and Tata Power Company Ltd for \n1,200 km of transmission lines associated with the Tala Hydro Electric Power in Bhutan on Build-\nOwn-Operate Transfer basis. The project was successfully commissioned in August 2006. ADB \n ", "6   \nprovided a loan1 for the project through its private sector window. Several joint-venture projects are \nat an advanced stage of selection of investors. The other option is through what is known as an \nindependent private transmission company, and this envisages 100% private-sector investment. \nPart of a system strengthening project in the western region is being implemented in this way. \nPOWERGRID plans various joint-venture projects between now and 2012. \n \n22.  Corporate  Governance.  POWERGRID  is  committed  to  sound  corporate  governance \nprinciples by promoting corporate fairness, transparency, fiduciary responsibility, and accountability \namongst  all  its  stakeholders,  beyond  its  sole  shareholder.  POWERGRID  believes  that  good \ngovernance should entail trusteeship, empowerment, and accountability of the management while \nremaining responsive to Government policies. It is focused towards its mission of \u201cestablishment \nand operation of regional and national power grids to facilitate transfer of power within and across \nthe regions with reliability, security and economy on sound commercial principles.\u201d2 This mission is \ncarried out based on the well-established practices in engineering and design, procurement, project \nmanagement, finance, and human resources, which are being followed in letter and spirit and are \nbeing continually improved upon. \n \n23.   Because its bonds are publicly listed, POWERGRID is required by the Securities and \nExchange Board of India to have at least 50% of its board directors as nonexecutive members. \nPresently, POWERGRID has nine directors \u2014 three executive directors from POWERGRID and six \nnonexecutive directors. Of the six nonexecutive directors, two are government directors appointed \npart-time; the other four are independent directors.  \n \n24.  To introduce a further layer of nonexecutive oversight into its corporate governance system, \nPOWERGRID has introduced certain committees of independent eminent persons relating to the \nfollowing  areas:  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  procurement,  (iii)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards, and (iv) research and development. These committees report directly to the chairman. \nIn order to have better and more focused attention on certain areas, the board has also constituted \nseveral other subcommittees to focus on functional matters such as (i) the award of contracts, (ii) \nfeasibility reports and revised cost estimates, and (iii) bonds. Improvements suggested by the \nexperts are progressively incorporated into POWERGRID\u2019s procedures. POWERGRID is committed \nto effective quality project management aligned to its documented quality management system to \nthe requirements of International Organization for Standardization (lSO) 9001 1994 (certification \nachieved in July 1995). An integrated management system has been developed by integrating the \nrequirements of ISO 9001:2000 (quality management system), ISO 14001:2004 (environmental \nmanagement  system)  and  OHSAS  18001:1999  (occupational  health  and  safety  management \nsystem).3 A summary of governance measures is in Table 1. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Navratna  Status.4 Although  substantially  owned  by  the  Government,  POWERGRID  is \npermitted  to  operate  with  some  managerial  and  financial  autonomy.  POWERGRID  has  been \nclassified as a mini-ratna company, in which it may make capital expenditures and investment in \njoint ventures without Government approval up to a certain threshold. Like other commercially \nviable  state-owned  enterprises,  POWERGRID  enters  into  an  annual  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Government.  The  agreement  sets  annual  performance  targets  for  the \nphysical, financial, and dynamic parameters of POWERGRID and gives the Government a baseline \nfor independent monitoring. At the end of each fiscal year, MOP evaluates POWERGRID\u2019s actual \nperformance, and it has regularly ranked in the highest category. Based on such performance, \nPOWERGRID has requested the Government for navratna status, which would provide greater \nmanagerial  and  financial  autonomy.  Such  designation  would  affirm  POWERGRID\u2019s  corporate \ngovernance reforms. The Government  is expected to confer the Navratna status soon. \n \n26.  Initial  Public  Offering  and  Partial  Divestment  of  Government  Shares.  As  per  the \ndecision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in November 2006, the Government has \n                                                 \n4  A navratna company does not require Government approval for any investment and is allowed to enter into a joint \nventure business in India as well as overseas up to certain limit. \n ", "8   \ndecided to issue fresh shares to the public in three public-sector power companies\u2014POWERGRID, \nthe Rural Electrification Corporation, and the Power Finance Corporation\u2014up to 24% of their paid-\nup capital, and to divest itself of 5% of its shares in the companies. POWERGRID invited bids for its \ninitial public offering up to 10% of its paid-in capital between 10 and 13 September 2007. The \ndivestment of the Government shares was planned simultaneously. These actions have diluted \nGovernment ownership in POWERGRID from 100% to about 86.4%. This is a positive step in \nPOWERGRID\u2019s corporate governance reform program, as it will encourage further disclosure of \nfinancial information to shareholders, investment professionals, and the general public. Public listing \ncreates regular market information on commercial performance and monitoring by a separate class \nof shareholders other than the Government (this is because shareholders have a residual rather \nthan a priority claim on the firm\u2019s assets; the value of minority shareholders\u2019 investments in the \nutility  compared  with  the  lenders  depends  more  strongly  on  the  performance  of  the  utility). \nPOWERGRID has received enormous response from the bidders in all categories. Massive positive \nmarket  response  to  the  share  issue  reflects  POWERGRID\u2019s  existing  corporate  governance \npractices and demonstrated confidence in the company going forward on a commercial basis \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n \n27.  The major development partner in the electricity sector has been the World Bank, which has \nsupported power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including assistance directed \nto SEBs in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. ADB \ncoordinates with the World Bank on the geographic demarcation of state-level operations, as well \nas to ensure the overall complementary nature of actions at both the central and state levels. Other \nmajor  agencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany. Besides these, technical assistance is being provided \nby  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment  Agency,  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development.  Although  the \ncombined  assistance  of  all  assistance  agencies  constitutes  only  about  8\u201310%  of  the  total \ninvestments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have resulted.  \n \n28.  Previous ADB assistance to the power sector in India is listed in Appendix 4. Since 1986, \nADB has approved loan assistance totaling about $3.59 billion5 for 23 energy sector projects in \nIndia. Out of these, three loans among five totaling $925 million were POWERGRID projects. ADB \nhas  also  given  India  37  technical  assistance  grants  totaling  about  $22.5  million,  mainly  for \nassistance on power sector reforms and restructuring at the national and state level. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n \n29.  ADB has provided three loans6 to POWERGRID, one of which has been post-evaluated.7 \nRelevant lessons learned are that (i) with proper planning, effective project monitoring mechanisms, \nand motivated and well-trained personnel, infrastructure projects can be implemented successfully \neven  in  difficult  terrain;  and  (ii)  POWERGRID\u2019s  timely  acquisition  of  land  and  other  statutory \nclearances helped in project implementation. It was also learned that the project implemented by \nPOWERGRID  has  contributed  to  (i)  overall  growth  of  the  power  sector,  (ii)  a  reduction  in \n                                                 \n5  Including the amount of approved tranches for the MFF.  \n6  ADB. 1995.

Under the ongoing Power Grid Transmission (Sector) Project,8 POWERGRID is exempted \nfrom ADB review of bidding documents, provided that, at the time of release of such bidding \ndocuments, POWERGRID forwards copies to ADB for post-facto approval. POWERGRID has also \nbeen allowed to award contracts without submitting bid evaluation reports and award proposals to \nADB for prior approval when the contract amount is less than $3 million for the lowest evaluated \nbidder  provided  that  (i)  any  bid  evaluation  cases  raising  unusual  issues  or  problems  shall, \nregardless of contract amount, be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval; and (ii) contracts \nshall be awarded to the lowest evaluated bidders. This has helped acceleration of procurement. \n \n31.  According  to  the  survey  conducted  for  POWERGRID  in  the  recent  Sector  Assistance \nProgram Evaluation on the Indian power sector, it is pointed out that ADB\u2019s advice on developing its \nenvironmental standards and social policies and on designing its procurement procedures has \nassisted  with  POWERGRID\u2019s  institutional  development  and  that  these  factors,  along  with  the \nadditional credibility that POWERGRID gains as an ADB client, are also vital parts of the lending \nrelationship. However, POWERGRID also asserts that ADB attempts to exercise too much control \nover the detail of POWERGRID decisions in procurement and safeguard matters. Particularly, it \nfinds  some  ADB  conditions  irksome;  for  example,  the  request  for  a  resettlement  plan  for  a \ntransmission line project when it is not the company\u2019s policy to acquire land but rather to pay \ncompensation for crop losses. Under the Facility, these concerns have been duly addressed by \nproviding  more  autonomy  and  flexibility  to  POWERGRID,  based  on  overall  assessment  of  its \ncapacity in procurement and safeguard measures.  \n \n  6.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n \n32.  Cognizant of the strong nexus between infrastructure and poverty reduction, ADB\u2019s overall \nassistance has taken a balanced infrastructure development approach, comprising road systems, \nwater transport, railways, hydrocarbons, and energy. ADB\u2019s assistance for the energy sector as \noutlined in the 2005 country strategy and program updates9 has six main priorities: (i) reforming the \npower sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power sources (for example, run-of-\nriver hydropower projects and renewable energy); (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and \ndistribution systems; (iv) strengthening institutions to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct 2003, including the development of more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) \npromoting  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi)  encouraging  energy  conservation  and  ensuring \nenvironmental and social sustainability.  \n \n33.  To support the Government\u2019s goal of Power for All by 2012, ADB\u2019s future strategy for the \npower sector will be aligned with the 11th Five-Year Plan. ADB will continue to support state-level \npower sector reforms by including more states, such as Himachal Pradesh and Bihar, and by \nincreasing its efforts in the states in which it is currently active, such as Assam, Gujarat, Madhya \nPradesh,  and  Uttarakhand.  The  proposed  loan  is  consistent  with  the  strategy  of  supporting \nexpansion and optimization of the transmission network and will also help to promote the open-\naccess policy introduced under the Electricity Act 2003. ADB intervention will (i) promote knowledge \ntransfer  in  relation  to  best  practices  in  the  international  power  sector,  (ii)  improve  corporate \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004.

ADB\u2019s activities under Energy Efficiency Initiative (EEI) in India aims at enhancing the \nimpact of the Government\u2019s initiatives and includes both demand- and supply-related programs. \nThe objectives of ADB\u2019s assistance will be achieved effectively through a combination of lending \nand  technical  assistance  instruments.  The  planned  activities  include  (i)  renovation  and \nmodernization of existing hydro and thermal power plants, (ii) upgrading of inefficient thermal power \nplants to enhance their performance, (iii) developing renewable and alternative energy sources, (iv) \nreducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and distribution networks and facilities, \nand (v) bringing demand-side management and energy conservation into the mainstream while \nensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.

THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  The proposed investment program is expected to promote sustained social and economic \nprosperity and growth in India by providing an adequate and reliable power supply. Inadequate \nsupply of electricity has been a major hindrance to economic growth in the country, affecting all \nconsumer  groups  and  social  classes.  The  outcome  of  the  investment  program  is  enhanced \ntransmission network reliability and efficiency through expansion and augmentation of the national \ntransmission grid. This, in turn, will lead to improved quality of supply in the major demand centers \nof the northern and western regions of the country. Through the development of a sophisticated \nnational  grid  to  be  linked  with  neighboring  countries  with  untapped  natural  resources,  the \ninvestment program will also contribute to enhancing regional and national energy security and \nenergy efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The investment program is part of \nthe least-cost development plan for the power sector, and supports the Government\u2019s goal of Power \nfor All by 2012. \n  \nB.  Outputs \n36.   The investment program will have two projects for funding under the Facility.  \n \n(i)  Project 1: Upgradation of Transmission Capacity from Uttarakhand. This project \nis to provide adequate transmission capacity for reliable transfer of power generated \nin the Tehri Valley in  Uttarakhand to constituents of the northern region, by (i) \nestablishment of 765/400 kV, 10 x 500 MVA transformation capacity at Tehri Pooling \nStation and Meerut substations within the existing substation site, (ii) construction of \n103 km of loop-in-loop-out of Bareilly\u2013Mandaula 400 kV double-circuit transmission \nline at Meerut (54km of loop-in and 49km of loop-out), and (iii) modification of a \nseries of capacitors for operation at 765 kV level. ADB funding is proposed for \nsubstations only. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n ", "   11  \n(ii)  Project 2: \u00b1800kV High Voltage Direct Current Northeastern\u2013Northern/Western \nInterconnector. This project aims to deliver bulk power generated from hydropower \nstations in the northeastern region to the power-deficit areas of the northern and \nwestern  regions  through  construction  of  about  1,800  km  of  \u00b1800  kV  HVDC \ntransmission systems from Biswanath Chariyali to Agra, including 800 kV converting \nand  inverting  stations  at  both  ends,  and  construction  of  400  kV  connecting \ntransmission lines at Biswanath Chariyali for transfer of power from various power \nplants in the northeastern region. ADB funding is proposed for the \u00b1800 kV HVDC \ntransmission lines only.  \n \n37.  These projects have been proposed for ADB funding due to (i) their project readiness, (ii) \nthe need to dovetail transmission system development with associated generation projects, and (iii) \nthe level of innovation in introducing state-of-the-art high voltage transmission technology. Project \nreadiness of these projects is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. Other additional projects may \nbe added subsequently if necessary. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n38.  Road Map. The 11th Five-Year Plan aims to further accelerate the reforms and underpin the \nGovernment\u2019s  policy  of  Power  for  All  by  2012  through  (i)  expanding  coverage,  (ii)  improving \nreliability, and (iii) enhancing sustainability and efficiency of the interstate transmission network. \nExpected outcomes and major milestones of the plan are defined in the transmission sector road \nmap. The sector road map includes specific technical targets to be achieved by 2012 in terms of \nexpansion  of  the  national  power  grid  and  reliability  and  efficiency  of  the  grid  operations.  As \nPOWERGRID is the provider of interstate and interregional transmission services, the sector road \nmap also includes various measures to further strengthen POWERGRID\u2019s institutional capacity to \nachieve the technical targets, based on its long-term corporate strategy. These measures aim to \nstrengthen  corporate  governance,  improve  efficiencies,  and  enhance  the  financial  viability  of \nPOWERGRID through (i) financial management, (ii) safeguard compliance, (iii) human resource \nmanagement, (iv) information technology, and (v) cost reduction. The road map provides for a long-\nterm framework of ADB\u2019s intervention in the sector and will be used as a basis for dialogue with the \nGovernment and POWERGRID during the Facility period. Based on the road map, the Facility will \nhelp enhance the commercial viability of POWERGRID by providing long-term funding support for \nits  immediate  investments  and  promoting  various  measures  planned  under  the  road  map  to \nstrengthen corporate governance and improve operational efficiencies. This combined approach will \nensure  the  development  impact  of  the  investment  program.  The  central  transmission  sector \nroadmap is provided in Appendix 3.      \n \n39.  Energy Efficiency Improvement and Emission Reduction. The Facility will incorporate \nstate-of-the-art HVDC transmission technology. HVDC is proven to be the most cost effective \nmeans of transmitting bulk power over long distances, well beyond that which is feasible using \nconventional AC technology. At 1,000 MW design capacity for point-to-point transmission, HVDC is \neconomically preferable for system lengths exceeding 700\u2013800 km, and transmission losses are \nalso less.   \n \n40.  The proposed projects will also improve the overall power system efficiency by connecting \n1,000 MW pumped storage facilities under Project 1 and 2,600 MW hydro generation facilities \nunder Project 2 to the northern and western region grids. The projects will reduce energy demand \nat certain critical times, typically when the regional electrical system experiences peaks. It will \ngenerally have only small effects on overall energy use but will focus sharply on reducing energy \nuse at critical times (peak-shaving load management) and increasing off-peak energy consumption \n ", "12  \nwithout necessarily reducing peak demands (valley-filling load management). The projects will \nenable the use of hydropower storage systems in the northeastern region to (i) meet peak load \nneeds as well as provide emergency power injection into the grid when fossil-fuel plants go offline \nunexpectedly, and (ii) store off-peak power generated from fossil-fuel facilities that are not easily \ncycled. A significant advantage of the connected pumped storage system is its ability to rapidly \ninject a large amount of power into the power grid. \n \n41.  The investment program does entail potential cumulative and induced impacts, which are \nlargely considered positive. POWERGRID will transfer low-carbon energy from hydropower plants \nin the northeastern and northern regions to the other regions which experience power deficit. The \nproposed projects will reduce emissions by replacing thermal generation at demand sites (northern \nand western regions) through the transmission of clean, less polluting hydropower generated in \nphases from the remote northeastern region of the country with negligible environmental impacts. \nADB estimates that Project 1 associated hydropower plants will offset more than 8 million tons (t) \nper year of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent by 2015, and cumulative offsets of more than 263 \n2\nmillion t of CO -equivalent during the 30-year project lifecycle (based on about 2,400 MW of \n2\nhydropower available for transmission). ADB also estimates that Project 2 is expected to generate \nabout 20 million t in CO  emission reductions in the first phase (2010\u20132015) with the total amount of \n2\nCO -equivalent emission reductions reaching 551 million t over the lifetime of the project. Additional \n2\ncumulative offsets gained from the reduction in transmission losses in Project 2 account for 7 million \nt CO equivalent over the lifetime of the project. Potential revenues from carbon finance might, \n2 \ntherefore,  constitute  a large  percentage  of  annual  interest  payments  and  initial  operation and \nmaintenance costs during the first several years. Other positive impacts include (i) the expansion of \nlow-carbon  energy,  offsetting  emissions  from  thermal  power  plants,  (ii)  transmission  system \nefficiency improvements, and (iii) economic growth related to the improved power supply to millions \nof customers. The cumulative reduction of other pollutants is estimated as follows: (i) 2.8 million t of \nsulfur dioxide, (ii) 1.4 million t of nitrogen oxides, and (iii) 0.5 million t of particulate matters (every \n20 years). \n \n42.  Nonsovereign Borrowing. POWERGRID plans to mobilize funds for capital investment \nthrough ADB loans, other foreign borrowings, domestic bonds and loans, and internal resources. \nBased on the CERC tariff norms, POWERGRID is seeking to arrange 70% debt financing for its \nsubprojects. Of this debt financing, approximately 70% is raised in Indian rupees from the local \nmarket. However, the local market is constrained from providing long-term funding which is required \nin order to properly amortize the capital costs. Therefore, POWERGRID regularly accesses long-\nterm foreign loans from multilateral financing institutions such as ADB and the World Bank with \nGovernment  guarantees.  As  its  borrowing  requirements  are  substantial  to  meet  2012  goals, \nPOWERGRID has requested a nonsovereign loan from ADB. The nonsovereign loans will allow \nPOWERGRID to access a new source of funding\u2014the syndicated offshore banking market for \nforeign-currency  loans\u2014and  to  develop  relationships  with  the  commercial  market,  which  will \nimprove POWERGRID\u2019s visibility and credibility as a reputable borrower and enhance its corporate \nprofile. Eventually, it will assist POWERGRID to (i) move from Government-guaranteed lending to \ncommercial borrowing without any credit enhancement, and (ii) become a more commercially viable \nentity.    \n \n43.  Private\u2013Public  Partnership. Subject to applicable ADB policies and due diligence, the \nFacility can be used for financing POWERGRID\u2019s equity investment at its request for joint venture \ntransmission projects with private sector investors and financial institutions. This could be combined \nwith  ADB\u2019s  other  instruments,  including  guarantees  and  syndications  of  loan  and  guarantees \nthrough the private sector window, to accelerate private-public partnership in the transmission \n ", "   13  \nsector and help ADB play a more proactive role in private sector participation. POWERGRID plans \nvarious joint venture projects between now and 2012. \n \nD.  Technical Justification and Selection Criteria \n44.  CEA  carries  out  least-cost  generation  expansion  and  long-term  transmission  planning \nstudies for the country using an integrated resource planning approach to ensure optimum use of \nnational power resources. Based on these studies, POWERGRID, as the central transmission \nutility, formulated its investment plan during the 11th Five-Year Plan period through exhaustive \nengineering  design  calculations.  POWERGRID  employs  state-of-the-art  commercially  available \npower system simulation software packages to perform detailed power flow studies, short-circuit \ncalculations, and dynamic and transient stability analyses to ensure a robust yet optimal national \ntransmission grid based on internationally proven extra-high voltage AC and HVDC transmission \ntechnologies. \n \n45.  All projects have been subjected to a rigorous and strict scrutiny process. The proposed \nprojects have been selected based on criteria which includes the following. \n \n(i)  The project is technically feasible and is part of the least-cost development plan. \n(ii)  The project is part of the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n(iii)  The project is economically viable.  \n(iv)  The project is socially sound and will include measures to mitigate any adverse \nsocial impacts, if any. \n(v)  Sufficient  counterpart  funding  will  be  allocated  to  implement  the  project  as \nscheduled. \n(vi)  All necessary central and state government approvals will be obtained for the project \nin a timely manner.  \n(vii)  The SEB or other beneficiary of the project has a satisfactory payment record with \nPOWERGRID, i.e., POWERGRID will maintain accounts receivable at a level not \nexceeding an amount equivalent to the income proceeds of its transmission services \nfor the preceding 3 months of billable amount as allowed by CERC. \n \nE.  Investment Program Cost Estimates \n46.  The investment program is estimated to cost the equivalent of about $2,542 million including \ntaxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loans from ADB during construction (Table 2). \nThe detailed cost estimates of the investment program are provided in Appendix 5. \n ", "14  \n \n \nTable 2: Program Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem      Total \nA.

Investment Program Financing Plan \n \n47.  POWERGRID has requested financing of up to the equivalent of $600 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources under the sovereign-guaranteed multitranche financing facility (MFF). \nThe MFF will extend multiple loans of no less than $100 million to finance part of the costs of the \ntwo projects, and possibly other projects, constituting the investment program. These will be subject \nto  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  request  (PFR)  by  POWERGRID  and  India,  and \nexecution of the related loan and guarantee agreements. POWERGRID and India have entered into \na framework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB, which satisfies the requirements set forth in \nAppendix 4 of ADB\u2019s policy.12  POWERGRID has also requested a $400 million nonsovereign loan. \nAs and when decided by POWERGRID, the nonsovereign loan will be presented in a separate \nreport and recommendation to the board.   \n \n48.  The provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans will apply to each loan under the Facility, subject to \nmodifications, if any, that might be included under each loan agreement. The specific terms of each \nloan will be based on the related PFR, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility. POWERGRID has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision \nto borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere made independently, and did not rely on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n49.  As the borrower, POWERGRID will bear the foreign exchange risk, and the cost of the \nguarantee provided by India. The financing plan for the investment program is in Table 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005.

Project 1 is estimated to cost the equivalent of about $371.8 million and Project 2 about \n$2,170.8  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges.  POWERGRID  has \nsubmitted to ADB the first PFR for tranche 1, requesting $400 million. This will cover payment for \nsubstation contract packages of Project 1 and transmission line contract packages of Project 2. The \nfirst PFR is presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors together with this document and the FFA. The \nloan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. It will have an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year on full undisbursed amount, and such other terms and conditions as agreed in the Loan \nAgreement.  \n \n51.  Each project will consist of one or more components. POWERGRID will ensure that the \nentire Project meets the project selection criteria as well as ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements \nwhen any component under the Project is proposed for funding under the Facility. A component \nmay include one or  more contract packages. In case a component or a contract package is \nfinanced by multiple loans under the Facility, ADB will ensure that the entire component or contract \npackage is in compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policy requirements when any loan is requested.  \n \n52.   Along with the first PFR, POWERGRID has submitted to ADB a component-wise financing \nplan under the Facility and a contract-wise financing plan under the first tranche. The second and \nsubsequent  PFRs  may  include  a  revised  component-wise  financing  plan  and  a  contract-wise \nfinancing plan for subsequent tranches.  \n    \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n53.  POWERGRID will be the Executing Agency for the investment program, and has set up a \nprogram  management  unit  headed  by  the  executive  director  (corporate  planning)  at  its \nheadquarters.  The  unit,  through  the  related  functional  departments  of  POWERGRID,  will  be \nresponsible for processing and implementing the investment program. POWERGRID has nine \nregional offices headed by an executive director or general manager to implement the projects \nunder their respective jurisdictions. The additional general manager or deputy general managers in \nthe  region  responsible  for  construction  and  commissioning  of  subprojects  will  report  to  their \nrespective regional heads. The regional heads will facilitate submission of the implementation \nprogress reports. The management of POWERGRID will receive monthly progress reports and \n ", "16  \nreview each project in quarterly review meetings. The PMU will maintain regular consultations with \nADB and other funding agencies for implementation of the projects. \n \n54.  The investment program will follow MFF implementation procedures. POWERGRID will \nappraise all projects and be responsible for processing and implementing them. POWERGRID will \nprepare a project appraisal report that will include (i) the rationale for each project, (ii) the scope \nand components, (iii) a technical description and analysis, (iv) the cost estimates and financing \nplan,  (v)  an  environmental  assessment,  (vi)  a  resettlement  plan,  (vii)  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan, and (viii) the implementation arrangements along with financial, economic, and \ninstitutional  analyses.  POWERGRID  will  be  supported  by  technical  experts  funded  by \nPOWERGRID  in  preparation  of  technical  specifications  and  bidding  documents,  bidding  and \nevaluation, construction supervision, and testing and commissioning of Project 2. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n55.  The proposed Facility will be implemented over 7 years, inclusive of procurement and \nconstruction  activities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  March  2015.  The  implementation \nschedule of projects 1 and 2 is provided in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n56.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed under the investment program will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). For such procurement, bid specifications will be prepared in a manner to ensure maximum \ncompetition under international competitive bidding. A procurement plan and indicative contract  \npackages for Tranche 1 is in Appendix 7 and an assessment of POWERGRID\u2019s procurement \ncapacity is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. Procurement plans will be prepared for each \nPFR.   \n \n57.   To  further  facilitate  procurement  process,  POWERGRID  will  initially  prepare  a  model \nbidding document for each type of contract package under the Facility, such as transmission \ntowers, conductors, insulators, hardware fittings, and substations, and will seek approval from ADB \nfor such model bidding documents. In preparing such model bidding documents, POWERGRID will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Standard  Bidding  Document  for  Procurement  of  Goods  for  supply,  erection  and \ncommissioning  contracts  as  well  as  supply-only  contracts,  and  identify  sections  of  bidding \ndocuments that may be specific to each procurement package. Upon ADB\u2019s approval of the model \nbidding  documents,  POWERGRID  will  be  exempted  from  ADB\u2019s  prior  approval  of  its  bidding \ndocuments provided that (i) such documents are in line with the corresponding model bidding \ndocument, and at the time of release of invitation for bid, they are forwarded to ADB for post-facto \napproval, and (ii) POWERGRID issues amendments to such documents based on comments made \nby ADB, if any, during the bidding period. Further, POWERGRID may also award contracts of value \nless than $10 million in each case without seeking prior approval of ADB, provided that the lowest \npriced bidder at bid opening is also the recommended bidder for contract award. All cases involving \nunusual issues shall be submitted to ADB for prior review, and ADB shall retain the right to disallow \nutilization of loan proceeds in case (i) it is unable to agree with POWERGRID on either the bidding \ndocuments  or  the  bid  evaluation  report,  either  in  prior  or  post-facto  review  cases,  or  (ii) \nmisprocurement is established after due process. \n \n58.  Before commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive bidding, ADB, \nthe Government of India, and the Borrower will review the public procurement rules and regulations \nof the Government of India, and the Borrower's Works & Procurement Policy and Procedures to \n ", "   17  \nensure consistency with the Procurement Guidelines. Any necessary modifications or clarifications \nwill be reflected in the procurement plan. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n59.  POWERGRID has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing for procurement \nof goods up to 20% of each tranche for a period of up to 12 months prior to loan signing. ADB \nmanagement has agreed to approve retroactive financing for all projects under the Facility up to \n20%  of  the  proceeds  from  individual  loans  under  the  MFF  provided  that  expenditures  are  in \naccordance with the Procurement Guidelines and safeguard policies, and were incurred during the \n12 months before the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement. POWERGRID was \ninformed that approval of advance contracting or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the ensuing project. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  POWERGRID.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to audit and examine directly or through its agents, any \nalleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprojects  under  the \ninvestment program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are \nincluded  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the investment program shall include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of \nPOWERGRID, and all contractors, suppliers, and other service providers as they relate to the \ninvestment program. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  Each  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed between POWERGRID and ADB. Loan disbursements will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon by POWERGRID and ADB. No imprest account will be \nrequired for disbursement under the Facility.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n62.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the investment program \nwill be established in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. \nWithin 6 months of the close of the financial year, POWERGRID will submit (i) annual project \naccounts, with detailed descriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures; and (ii) annual \nfinancial statements comprising an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and \nrelated notes to the financial statements and consolidated for all of POWERGRID\u2019s operations. \nPOWERGRID will continue the current practice of hiring independent chartered accountants to \naudit its annual financial statements and annual project accounts, together with the memorandum \non issues identified during the audit process (i.e., management letter). These will be submitted with \nthe respective reports. The accounts will be prepared using accounting standards issued by the \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. The auditors will be required to provide an opinion on \nPOWERGRID\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants and indicate the details of the actual \ncalculations for all ratios, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan Agreement. \n \n ", "18  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n63.  POWERGRID will prepare progress reports for its respective projects and submit these to \nADB on a quarterly basis within 45 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide (i) a \nnarrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation \nschedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties  encountered,  (iv)  the  performance  of  the  project \nimplementation consultants, and (v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress \nreport will also include a summary financial account for the project loan components, consisting of \nproject expenditures for the year to date and total expenditure to date, and a contract-wise financing \nplan.  POWERGRID  will  undertake  periodic  project  performance  review  under  each  individual \ntranche of the loan, and also for the investment program to evaluate the scope, implementation \narrangements, progress, and achievements of objectives of the related project and the overall \ninvestment program.13 Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n64.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the investment program approval. \nADB will review the implementation and operation of the investment program based on the quarterly \nprogress reports and meet with POWERGRID and the Government semiannually to discuss the \nprogress of the individual project and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial \nmeasures  required  to  be  undertaken  towards  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  projects  and \ninvestment program. \n \n65.  A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness, focusing on the \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing the \nfinancial status of POWERGRID. Representatives of ADB and POWERGRID will take part in the \nreview, which will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful project \nimplementation and achievement of objectives. \n \n66.  POWERGRID will submit to ADB a project completion report within 6 months of physical \ncompletion of the projects, and a facility completion report within 6 months of physical completion of \nthe investment program. These reports will cover a detailed evaluation of projects and the Facility, \ncovering the design, costs, contractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social, environmental, and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details for each project and the Facility as may \nbe requested by ADB. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Investment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n67.  The  investment  program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  by  the \nprovision  of  adequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  The  proposed  investment  program  is \nexpected to support the achievements of the Government\u2019s policy of Power for All by 2012 by \nincreasing  transmission  capacity  and  enhancing  reliability  and  efficiency  of  the  transmission \nnetwork. Reliable power supply through expansion and augmentation of the national transmission \ngrid will remove the hindrance to economic growth in India caused by an unstable electricity supply. \n                                                 \n13 POWERGRID has a Corporate Monitoring Department headed by an executive director. The department has sufficient \ncapacity and systems to monitor individual projects as well as the entire investment program. \n ", "   19  \nThe investment program will also help reduce 821 million t14 of CO -equivalent emissions, primarily \n2\nby  replacing  thermal  generation  at  demand  sites  with  cleaner  transmitted  hydropower.  The \ninvestment program will help enhance the commercial viability of POWERGRID by providing long-\nterm funding support for its immediate investments and promoting various measures to strengthen \ncorporate governance and improve operational efficiencies. \n \nB.  Technical Analysis \n \n68.  Hydropower potential in the Tehri Valley is being tapped by the development of three \nintegrated power stations: the 1,000 MW Tehri-I plant, the 400 MW Koteshwar plant, and the 1,000 \nMW Tehri-II pumped storage facility. In May 2006, POWERGRID commissioned the first phase of \nthe transmission system associated with the power generation plants. The Tehri-I generation plant \nis under operation and Koteshwar generation plant will be operating by the end of 2008, and the \nTehri-II pumped storage facility is planned to be commissioned by June 2011. The transmission \ncapacity must be expanded in order to deliver power to Delhi and transfer beyond to various \nbeneficiaries of the northern region through existing and proposed transmission lines. \n \n69.  The northeastern region, Sikkim, and Bhutan are also endowed with large hydropower \npotential. The generation addition of about 35,000 MW in the northeastern region, and 15,000 MW \nin Sikkim and Bhutan, are expected in the future. Considering the low growth of power demand in \nthe northeastern region, Sikkim, and Bhutan, it is estimated that about 42,000\u201345,000 MW will be \nsurplus in these areas, whereas the generation-addition scenarios for the northern and western \nregions indicate that these regions will remain in a serious deficit situation in the foreseeable future. \nTherefore, surplus power from these generation sources will have to be transmitted to the load \ncenters of the northern and western regions over long distances. POWERGRID has studied various \noptions for reliable bulk power transmission over long distance in association with electric power \nresearch institutions, equipment manufactures, consultants, and experts across the world, and \nconcluded  that  an  \u00b1800kV  HVDC  transmission  system  would  need  to  be  installed  and \ncommissioned in stages matching with the development of hydropower generation projects in the \nnortheastern region, Sikkim, and Bhutan. Further studies recommended that construction of parallel \nconverters of 3,000 MW each in two stages for an ultimate capacity of 6,000 MW would be suitable \nin view of the commissioning schedule of the 2,000 MW Subansiri Lower hydropower plant by 2012 \nand the 600 MW hydropower plant at Kameng by 2011. In addition, a number of power producers \nhave submitted applications for transferring a total of about 4,000 MW of power by 2012 from \nSikkim to the northern and western regions. \n \nC.  Financial Management and Financial Analysis \n \n70.  While the financial management structure of POWERGRID was assessed and found to be \nadequate during the processing of LN 2152-IND (footnote 7), a financial management assessment \nwas undertaken to ensure the current ability of POWERGRID to fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements \nunder the proposed Facility. A financial management assessment questionnaire was completed by \nPOWERGRID to facilitate a review of its financial systems and processes, and to identify any \nissues or constraints.  \n \n71.  The  financial  accounting  system  of  POWERGRID  is  fairly  advanced,  utilizing \ncomputerization with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. Existence of well-defined charts \nof accounts enables proper recording of financial transactions. Accounting policies, based on the \naccounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, have been framed \n                                                 \n14 Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "20  \nfor  accounting  and  preparation  of  the  financial  statements.  Accounting  and  financial  reporting \nresponsibilities  are  carried  out  as  per  the  delegation  of  powers  defined  and  approved  by \nPOWERGRID\u2019s board of directors. POWERGRID\u2019s Finance Department has developed procedures \nand guidelines for this reporting. POWERGRID has constituted a committee of three independent \nchartered accountants to review its existing procedures, systems, and capabilities in the area of \nfinancial management, including risk management. The updated manuals have been shared with \nADB.  The  recent  issue  of  POWERGRID  shares  to  the  public  is  expected  to  further  enhance \naccountability, transparency, and predictability of its financial governance through further disclosure \nof information to shareholders, investment professionals, and the general public.   \n \n72.  POWERGRID maintains a sound financial position and generates sufficient cash flow to \ncover  its  cost  of  service,  capital  investment,  and  debt  payments.  In  FY2007,  POWERGRID \ngenerated Rs. 40.8 billion ($1,020 million) in revenue and Rs. 34.5 billion ($862.5 million) in gross \nearnings. This generated a net income of Rs. 12.3 billion ($308 million), up 22% over the previous \nfiscal year. Compounded average growth over the past four fiscal years was 13%. Its profit margin \nfor the past four fiscal years has been between 27% and 30%, which is relatively healthy for a \nregulated business. POWERGRID has maintained relatively modest debt levels with a debt-equity \nratio of 64:36 in FY2007. Its leverage is likely to gradually increase to keep pace with heavy capital \nexpansion. Although the projected capital expansion plan is aggressive and will require a much \ngreater  level  of  borrowings,  the  financial  projections  show  that  POWERGRID  will  remain  in \ncompliance with covenanted levels on the long term debt-equity ratio, accounts receivable, and self-\nfinancing ratio. Further details on POWERGRID\u2019s financial performance are provided in Appendix 8.  \n \n73.  Financial analysis of Tranche 1 projects has been carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.15 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been \nexpressed at constant 2006 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of \nreturn  (FIRR),  i.e.,  capital  investment,  and  operations  and  maintenance  reflect  the  costs  of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. The current transmission tariff scheme was used to estimate the \nrevenue, while incremental operation and maintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n74.  The FIRR of 7.9% compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) of 5.2%, indicating financial viability for the projects. Financial viability was gauged by \ncomparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  with-project  and  without-project  investment \nscenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the increased evacuation of power within the \ntransmission system due to the removal of transmission constraints as a result of the investment. \nNonquantifiable  financial  benefits,  such  as  quality  of  power  supply,  were  not  included  in  the \nfinancial evaluation. A summary of the financial analysis is provided in Appendix 9. \n \n75.  Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRRs are robust with (i) a 20% increase in \ncapital  costs,  (ii)  a  20%  increase  in  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  (iii)  a  1-year \nimplementation delay. As the principles of tariff allow POWERGRID projects to pass on the costs of \n(i) the full cost recovery of the loan capital, (ii) depreciation, (iii) return on equity, (iv) operation and \nmaintenance expenses, and (v) interest on working capital, the differences of the options are \nmarginal. \n \n \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "   21  \nD.  Economic Analysis \n \n76.  Projects to be financed under the Facility will need to demonstrate economic viability and \nsustainability, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.16 The \ninclusion of subprojects in the National Electricity Plan or other relevant least-cost transmission plan \nwill be a prerequisite for funding under the MFF.   \n \n77.  Economic analysis of POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program under the 11th Five-\nYear Plan (2008\u20132012) has been carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. A time-slice approach was adopted and the entire power sector investment \nprogram was considered, including upstream generation costs and downstream transmission and \nrelevant distribution costs. The validity of CEA\u2019s national electricity demand forecasts was verified \nand the least-cost nature of the proposed investment program was confirmed. The main economic \nbenefits are displaced thermal electricity generation and incremental consumption. Based on the \ninterregional transmission capacity that will be added through the investment program, and demand \nand generation capacity and plant factor forecasts capacity contained in the National Electricity \nPlan (Transmission), expected interregional power flows for winter, monsoon, and summer were \nmodeled and used to quantify benefits. Nonincremental output displaces generation from coal-fired \nthermal plants and captive diesel plants and was valued on this basis. Incremental output was \nvalued using consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for incremental consumption. The overall investment \nprogram has an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13.1%, indicating that it is \neconomically viable. Sensitivity analysis revealed that expected economic outcomes are robust \nunder a range of downside scenarios, reflecting the strong link between an adequate electricity \nsupply and economic growth. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 10. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n \n78.  The environmental assessment and review framework (EARF), which outlines the policy, \nprocedures, and institutional requirements for the overall investment program and each tranche, \nhas been prepared for the investment program (see Supplementary Appendix D). POWERGRID as \nthe Executing Agency is responsible for preparing the required environmental assessments and \nobtaining  all  necessary  government  clearances,  along  with  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  prior  to  the \nimplementation of the program. The environmental assessment of the proposed investments is \nbeing  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  the  EARF,  POWERGRID\u2019s \nEnvironmental and Social Policy & Procedures 2005 (ESPP), and the Government\u2019s environmental \nassessment  regulations  and  guidelines.  The  proposed  first  tranche  projects  are  classified  as \ncategory  B  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy.  POWERGRID  has  prepared  an  Initial \nenvironmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  first  tranche  projects.  Additional  environmental \nassessments will be prepared in due course for the future tranche projects, as outlined in the EARF. \n \n79.  Based on the IEE results and reconnaissance surveys, most of the impacts will occur during \nthe construction phase. Such measures as selective routing for transmission lines, the proper \ndesign of distribution substations, appropriate erosion-control measures, suitable management of \nconstruction-related  wastes,  and  provision  of  compensation  for  reforestation  (if  required)  will \nmitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  associated  with  the  construction  phase  of  the  investment \nsubprojects. Measures such as (i) compliance with India\u2019s national and state environmental, health, \nand safety regulations, and guidelines; (ii) proper equipment and hazardous material handling and \ndisposal, (iii) conformity with the ESPP and POWERGRID\u2019s operations and maintenance manuals, \nand (iv) periodic environmental monitoring, will address the identified environmental impacts during \n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "22  \nthe operational phase. The land required for the construction of transmission towers and placement \nof  transmission  lines  is  primarily  government  owned.  In  cases  when  the  transmission  line \nconstruction affects agricultural production, compensation provisions were prepared for temporary \nland acquisition. Land to be acquired for new distribution substations is mostly uninhabited, unused, \nand lies outside urban or rural settlements. \n \n80.  The enclosed summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) (Supplementary Appendix \nC) and environmental management plan (EMP) (Supplementary Appendix D), present the full list of \nadequate environmental mitigation and monitoring provisions and associated cost estimates for the \nEMP implementation. POWERGRID will incorporate the relevant environmental requirements into \ncivil contracts and operation subcontracts (as necessary). The project contractors will bear the \nprimary  responsibility  for  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction phase. POWERGRID assumes the ultimate responsibility for the overall adherence to \nthe IEE recommendations, and monitoring and reporting on the EMP implementation for each \nspecific project. \n \nF.  Social Safeguards \n \n81.  A compensation plan for temporary damages (CPTD)17 was prepared in full consultation \nwith affected communities to address the negative impacts under the projects according to the \nprovisions  agreed  upon  in  the  resettlement  framework.  Impacts,  which  will  be  due  to  the \nconstruction of an HVDC transmission line, are not expected to be significant. No indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  was  prepared  for  the  first  tranche  of  the  Facility  since  no \nsignificant impact is expected. However, additional assistance is provided in the entitlement matrix \nof the CPTD for indigenous peoples and other vulnerable affected persons.  \n \n82.  A resettlement framework and an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) have \nbeen prepared and will serve as a basis for preparing the CPTD and IPDP for additional projects as \nrequired, according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n(1998), the Land Acquisition Act, 1884, the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for \nProject Affected Persons (NPRR) (2003), and POWERGRID\u2019s ESPP. All plans will be prepared in \nfull consultation with affected persons, will be disclosed to them, and all compensation will be paid \nprior to the commencement of civil works. \n \n83.  Participation  of  affected  communities  was  used  as  a  fundamental  means  to  minimize \nadverse impacts. In particular, consultations with local communities have contributed to minimizing \nimpacts in the corridor of the transmission line. No permanent land acquisition will be necessary. In \naddition, POWERGRID will schedule the civil works in such a way as to minimize or even avoid \ndamage to crops. POWERGRID has already allocated sufficient budgetary resources to cover the \ncompensation packages provided in the CPTD. A maximum estimated maximum 4,926 hectares \n(ha) of land is expected to be affected on a temporary basis for the transmission line corridor, \naffecting a maximum of 14,085 affected persons18 (for less than 10% of their assets). A total of \n20,285 trees will also need to be compensated for, according to the provision in the CPTD. The \nsummary short resettlement plan (CPTD) for Projects 1 and 2 is provided in Appendix 11. \n \n                                                 \n17 Compensation plans in case of transmission lines which do not require permanent land acquisition, according to the \nGovernment laws. \n18 The number of affected persons is the most conservative estimate. POWERGRID will schedule civil works in such a \nway as to minimize (or even avoid) impacts and substantially reduce damage to crops and therefore the number of \naffected persons. The maximum estimated number of affected households is 4,115. \n ", "   23  \n84.  The resettlement framework and the IPDF were uploaded to the ADB and POWERGRID \nwebsites prior to loan appraisal. The CPTD was disclosed to the affected persons in local language \nand uploaded to the ADB and POWERGRID\u2019s websites. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is presented in Appendix 12. The resettlement framework and IPDF are provided as part of \nthe FFA (Supplementary Appendix E and F). \n \nG.  Poverty Assessment \n \n85.  The  investment  program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  by  the \nprovision of an adequate and reliable supply of electricity, which will support the Government\u2019s \nprojections  for  growth  in  energy  demand  and  confirmed  intent  to  make  affordable  grid-based \nelectricity supplies available to all by 2012. A secure and predictable electricity supply will provide \nsocial and economic benefits, and ensure improved conditions for schools, hospitals, and other \nsocial services. \n \n86.  In  addition,  the  improvement  of  the  interregional  transmission  capacity  is  expected  to \nimprove the distribution of economic benefits and industrial development normally associated with \npower supply and access to reliable electricity throughout the country. \n \nH.  Potential Risks and Assumptions \n \n87.  Key assumptions are that (i) the Government will remain committed to power sector reforms \nand development of the national electricity market, (ii) the Electricity Act 2003 will be implemented \nin a timely and transparent manner, and (iii) macroeconomic growth will remain stable. \n \n88.  Retail distribution of electricity in India is essentially handled by SEBs, and POWERGRID is \nexposed to this credit risk. While the one-time tripartite agreement settlement in 2004 resolved the \npast-due receivables and provided incentives for the improvement of current dues of the SEBs, \nthere is still a residual risk, as many SEBs are still loss-making. CERC, which sets the interstate \ntransmission tariffs in India, issued the most recent tariff order in 2004, to reduce POWERGRID\u2019s \nreturn on equity from 16% to 14% on a post-tax basis. There may be a possibility that CERC will \nconsider further reduction to lower the cost of power and augment resources of SEBs. Although \nPOWERGRID\u2019s current financial position is strong and its cash flow remains stable due to a cost-\nplus  tariff  structure,  with  all  debt  servicing,  foreign  exchange  losses,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance and costs allowed to be passed through, these risks may impact on its cash flow and \nimplementation  of  the  investment  program.  However,  such  risks  appear  to  be  low  given \nPOWERGRID\u2019s strong financial position and stringent payment discipline for SEBs introduced in \n2003. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to estimate aggregate impact from unfavorable changes \nin key variables. Under downside scenarios, POWERGRID would maintain its financial viability to \nfully meet funding requirements of the investment program in a timely manner.  \n \n89.  Other risks to the investment program include (i) delay in associated generation investments, \n(ii) increased prices of materials, and (iii) the failure to meet safeguard requirements in a timely \nmanner. The investment program is properly planned and sequenced with regard to the associated \ngeneration  plan.  Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  investment  program  indicate  that  it  is  resilient  to \nincreases  in  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  POWERGRID\u2019s  technical \ncapability to implement the investment program in a timely manner is well proven.          \n \n ", "24  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n90.

Overview \n \n1.  Balanced infrastructure development is a major challenge to be overcome by India if it is \nto achieve its sustainable annual economic growth target of 8\u20139% over the next 25 years. Given \nthat infrastructure inadequacies now exist in both rural and urban areas, preliminary exercises \nby the Government indicate that investment in infrastructure will need to increase from 4.6% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) to between 7% and 8% in the period of 11th Five-Year Plan \n(FY2008-FY2012). \n \n2.  Development needs in the power sector are vast. India\u2019s need for power is growing \nrapidly, with consumption increasing by about 64% over the last 10 years. The forecast growth \nof electricity supply to support GDP growth of about 9% is expected to be 8%. This is higher \nthan the last 10 years, as the energy-intensive manufacturing sector is expected to increase its \nshare of GDP. However, electricity is still inaccessible to the majority of households. While over \n80% of villages are already electrified, only 44 % of total households have access to electricity, \nand in the rural areas only 33% of households have access to electricity. As of 31 March 2005, \nannual per capita electricity consumption was about 606 kilowatt-hours (kWh).  \n \n3.  Energy and peaking shortage are high, with frequent load shedding (rationing) and \nsignificant  voltage  fluctuation  at  metered  consumer  levels.  This  undermines  industrial \ncompetitiveness and severely constrains economic growth. The major reasons for inadequate, \nerratic, and unreliable power supply especially at the state level are (i) inadequate power \ngeneration capacity, (ii) lack of optimum utilization of the existing generation capacity, (iii) an \ninadequate and aging subtransmission and distribution network, (iv) large scale theft and a \nskewed tariff structure, (v) slow pace of rural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity \nby the end consumer. \n \n4.  The total power generation capacity available to the grid was 132,329 megawatts (MW) \nas of 31 March 2007, comprising 34,653 MW of hydropower, 86,015 MW of thermal, 3,900 MW \nof nuclear, and 7,761 MW of renewable energy. State electricity boards (SEBs) own 53% of the \ntotal installed capacity, the central sector 34%, and the private sector 13%. From April 2006 to \nMarch 2007, the peak power deficit was about 13.5% (13,610 MW) and the energy deficit about \n9.9% (68,341 gigawatt-hours [GWh]).  \n \n5.   In India, aggregate technical and commercial [AT&C] losses are quite high arising \nmainly  from  distribution  losses,  unmetered  connections,  theft,  and  subsidies  to  agricultural \nconsumers. Nationwide AT&C losses amount to as much as 40%, compared to the world \naverage of 10\u201315%, while some states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat \nhave shown remarkable improvement in reducing AT&C losses. The operational inefficiencies \nrepresented by such high AT&C losses, combined with retail tariffs set far below the cost of \nsupply, have resulted in a deterioration of the financial health of state electricity boards (SEBs).. \nDespite the Government\u2019s efforts to create enabling and encouraging policy and regulatory \nframework,  poor  creditworthiness  of  SEB  remains  a  major  hindrance  to  private  sector \ninvestment in some states.  \n. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nB.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n6.  Electric power is a concurrent matter between the central and state governments. The \nMinistry of Power (MOP) is the policy setting authority for the sector, and is assisted by the \nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) which advises central and state governments and undertakes \nplanning and project appraisal. The central Government is also a major investor in the power \nsector  and  accounts  for  about  32%  of  generation  capacity.  It  operates  the  interregional \ntransmission grid and is responsible for developing and funding other initiatives such as national \npower regulation, power trading, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and rural electrification. \nPrivate generation accounts for about 10% of supply, and all other generation, transmission, \nand distribution is supplied at the state level. \n \n7.  National  power  regulation  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC) established in 1998. CERC has full authority to determine bulk tariffs and \nregulates  interstate,  regional,  and  interregional  transmission,  while  the  23  state  electricity \nregulatory  commissions  regulate  state  transmission  and  distribution.  State  and  central \nregulatory commissions have powers to (i) grant, amend, and revoke licenses; (ii) regulate the \nperformance  of  licensees;  (iii)  determine  tariffs;  (iv)  safeguard  consumers'  interest  while \nensuring cost recovery of electricity; (v) promote development of markets, including trading; and \n(vi) rationalize electricity tariffs by making subsidies transparent. The Appellate Tribunal for \nElectricity deals with appeals against decisions of the CERC and state electricity regulators. \n \n8.  To further accelerate the sector reforms, the Government enacted the Electricity Act \n2003, which came into force in June 2003. The Electricity Act provides for a complete legal \nframework for implementing the reforms, including the unbundling of SEBs, establishment of the \nstate regulator, licensing, and an antitheft provision. The Act also represents a departure from \nthe previous regime of the power sector by introducing more competition into wholesale as well \nas retail markets. Certain provisions in the Electricity Act, such as (i) open access to the \ntransmission and distribution network, (ii) recognition of power trading as a distinct activity, and \n(iii) the liberal definition of a captive generating plant, are expected to introduce and encourage \ncompetition in the power sector. \n \n9.  Among the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) developing member countries, India has \none of the most mature environmental regulatory systems. The system is based on command \nand  control  instruments  such  as  laws,  regulations,  and  standards.  Environmental  impact \nassessments (EIAs) for category A projects are prepared in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguards requirements. EIAs are required for individual power plants, and, as a \ngeneral rule, are prepared by the project sponsors or owners. The Ministry of Environment and \nForests (MOEF) has the final authority for EIA approval for large power plants (above 50 MW), \nand gives other environmental permits and clearances prior to construction and operations. \nState pollution control boards normally issue a  no-objection certificate for individual power \nplants, and are responsible for routine compliance oversight.1 Construction and operation of \ntransmission lines and networks are considered nonpolluting. Such projects are exempt from \nthe requirement to prepare and submit EIAs to MOEF, unless project works traverse forest \nareas. For these projects, an implementing agency is required to obtain forest clearance from \nMOEF.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB  has  accepted  in  principle  the  regulatory  system  of  the  Government  as  adequate  for  purposes  of \nenvironmental management of impacts arising from power plants.   \n ", "Appendix 2  33 \n \n \n \nC.  Sector Policy \n \n  1.  Medium- and Long-Term Strategy \n \n10.  Cognizant of the pivotal role that power sector development plays in economic growth \nand poverty reduction, the Government has confirmed its mission to provide electricity to all \nhouseholds at an affordable price by 2012. This goal of Power for All by 2012 has been \nelaborated into subsector-wise policies in the National Electricity Policy, which was prepared in \nFebruary 2005 in accordance with the Electricity Act 2003. The Government has set ambitious \nenergy policy objectives to achieve annual generation capacity of 1,000 kWh per capita by \n2012.  The  magnitude  of  investment  needed  to  achieve  the  goal  is  vast.  New  generation \ncapacity of 78,600 MW and matching transmission and distribution facilities need to be added \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan period.  \n \n11.  Integrated  Energy  Policy.  The  Integrated  Energy  Policy  (IEP)  adopted  by  the \nGovernment in 2006 specifies certain regulatory measures for (i) optimizing the power supply \nmix  through  greater  use  of  indigenous  hydropower  resources  and  renewable  energy,  (ii) \npursuing technologies that maximize energy efficiency, and (iii) continuing the ongoing power \nreforms to control technical and commercial losses. The Government is attempting to turn the \nIEP targets into tangible outcomes through the provision of incentives for investors to overcome \nchallenges such as (i) the perceived advantages of capital investment in everyday technology, \n(ii) smaller project sizes resulting in higher transaction costs of project preparation, and (iii) a  \nlack of institutional capacities. In particular, the IEP aims to change the current hydro-thermal \nratio of 25:75 to 40:60, with the renewable energy input to constitute not less than 10% of the \ngeneration base by 2012. Nationwide energy efficiency potential (including cogeneration) is \nestimated  at  over  20,000  MW,  but  the  realization  of  this  perspective  will  require  robust \nregulatory incentives on behalf of the Government.  \n \n12.  Table A2.1 shows how the IEP envisages that the source of electricity generation will \nevolve over time. This projection is one possible scenario assuming that (i) the country\u2019s GDP \ncontinues to grow at 8% annually, (ii) the country\u2019s hydropower potential of 150,000 MW will be \nfully developed, and (iii) 63,000 MW of nuclear power and 14,000 MW of wind energy will be \nadded. If the envisaged hydropower and nuclear capacity addition does not occur, coal-based \ngeneration will need to fill the gap.       \n \nTable A2.1: Sources of Electricity Generation \n(%) \nSource  FY2007  FY2012  FY2022  FY2032 \nThermal  81.2  79.1  76.7  78.0 \nHydro  12.2  13.6  13.6  11.0 \nNuclear  5.5  6.2  8.7  10.3 \nRenewable  1.1  1.1  1.0  0.7 \n  Total  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0 \n      Source: Integrated Energy Policy by the Government of India. \n \n2.  National Electricity Policy \n \n13.  In accordance with Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003, the Government formulated \nthe National Electricity Policy in February 2005 in consultation with CEA and state governments. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nTo achieve the overarching goal of Power for All by 2012, the National Electricity Policy aims to \n(i) fully meet power demand by 2012 with energy and peak shortages eliminated and adequate \nreserve assured, (ii) supply reliable and quality power of specified standards in an efficient \nmanner and at reasonable rates, (iii) increase per capita availability to over 1,000 kWh by 2012, \n(iv) ensure minimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh hour per household per day by 2012, (v) \nmake the sector financially viable, and (vi) protect consumers\u2019 interests. \n \n14.  Coal fuel will continue to dominate power production in India in the near future, as the \ncountry attempts to increase its generation capacity to keep up with growing industrial and \nresidential power demand. While India will continue to emphasize development of large-scale \npithead coal-fired plants to take advantage of domestic coal resources rather than increasing \nfossil-fuel energy imports, the Government will endeavor to minimize environmental impacts \nthrough  employing  state-of-the-art  technologies  and  continuing  to  develop  untapped \nhydropower sources in the northeastern and northern regions.  \n15.  The thermal-hydropower ratio was close to 50:50 in the early 1960s, partly because \nearly economic development policy emphasized support for agriculture, which has extensive \nirrigation demands. Industrial development became a priority in the 1960s, after which new \nthermal plants dominated the generation mix. For a variety of reasons, by 2003 the Government \nrecognized the need to increase the hydropower proportion and introduced an initiative to \ndevelop up to about 50,000 MW of new hydropower capacity as part of the Power for All by \n2012 policy. Preliminary feasibility studies were conducted under MOP auspices on over 300 \ncandidate sites, and these identified over 30,000 MW of potential hydropower that could be \ncommercially developed (based on an estimated 1st-year tariff of Rs2 per kWh or less). MOP \nhas  taken  several  policy  measures  to  accelerate  hydropower  development,  including  the \nstreamlining of project approval processes and a review of tariff policies.

The  generation  of  power  no  longer \nrequires a license from regulators and thermal generation does not require clearance from CEA. \nFor hydropower generation, the limit of capital expenditure above which CEA concurrence is \nrequired has been raised. It has taken several policy measures, including streamlining of the \nproject approval process and a review of tariff policies, to accelerate hydropower development. \nRestrictions on captive power generation have been substantially relaxed to allow captive plants \n ", "Appendix 2  35 \n \n \nto be established by a group of consumers, thus enabling small and medium industries to \nsecure a stable power supply, and to allow captive generators to sell surplus power through the \ngrid to consumers who are allowed open access. \n \n17.  The  planned  capacity  addition  needs  to  be  accompanied  by  timely  investments  in \nassociated transmission systems. The open-access policy introduced under the Electricity Act \n2003 requires adequate augmentation of transmission capacity. The Government, therefore, \nemphasizes  development  of  the  national  power  grid,  including  interstate  connections, \ntechnology upgrade, and the optimization of transmission costs.    \n \n3.  Distribution Reforms \n \n18.  The major weakness of the power sector is on the distribution side which is entirely the \ndomain of the states. Restructuring of state utilities is a major challenge, and the process needs \nto  safeguard  consumer  interests  while  restoring  the  financial  viability  of  the  sector. \nConsequently,  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program  (APDRP)  was \ninitiated in 2001 to introduce reforms at the distribution level with an overall objective of reducing \nAT&C losses to 15% by 2007. The APDRP is an instrument to leverage distribution reforms in \nthe states. Therefore, priority is given to projects from those states which have committed to a \ntime-bound  program  of  reforms  including  (i)  establishment  of  a  regulator,  (ii)  filing  and \nimplementation of tariff orders, (iii) securitization of dues from central public sector utilities, (iii) \nmetering of 11 kV feeders, (iv) metering of all consumers, (v) energy audit at 11 kV level, and \n(vi) maintenance of grid discipline. Metering on 11 kV feeders has improved from 81% in 2001 \nto 96% in 2006, and metering of consumers has improved from 78% to 92% in the same period, \nbut the average AT&C losses are still close to 50%, which the Government aims to reduce to \n15% by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan period. Functional unbundling and restructuring of \nliabilities are now mandated under the Electricity Act 2003. With financial support under the \nAPDRP, many states have unbundled their SEBs to put distribution companies under regulatory \noversight and some states have shown a much better performance than the average. The \nGovernment  encourages  private  sector  participation  in  distribution  and  has  privatized \ndistribution companies in Orissa and Delhi. Franchising of distribution business to the private \nsector is also encouraged by the Government as a means of loss reduction and this has been \nexplored in some states. \n \n4.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n19.  Since the formulation of the Policy on Private Participation in the Power Sector in 1991, \nthe Government has developed policy, legal, and regulatory framework to promote private \nsector participation, cognizant of the fact that the investment requirements for the power sector \nwould exceed the resources available in the public sector and could not be met without private \nsector investment. The Electricity Act 2003 has opened the way for (i) competition in power \ntransmission and distribution, (ii) power trading and market development, and (iii) new providers \nof power supply in rural areas.  \n \n20.  In addition to the traditional independent power producer (IPP) projects, under tariff-\nbased competitive bidding the Government has initiated larger thermal power projects, called \nultra mega power projects, and these use the latest super-critical boiler technologies. In the \narea of power transmission, the Government issued guidelines for private sector participation \nwhich envisaged two distinct options: (i) joint venture, and (ii) independent private transmission \ncompany. As a pilot joint venture project, Tata Power and POWERGRID are executing specific \ntransmission  lines  associated  with  the  Tala  Hydro  Electric  Project  and  the  East  North \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nInterconnector. In distribution, as a measure of state-level power sector reform, privatization has \nbeen implemented in Orissa and Delhi, while outsourcing through franchising is being explored \nin some states. \n \n5.  Rural Electrification \n \n21.  The key development objective of the power sector is the supply of electricity to all areas \nincluding rural areas as mandated in Section 6 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Only about 56% of \nrural households have been electrified even though many of the households without electricity \nare willing to pay for electricity. To achieve its goal of Power for All by 2012, the Government \ninitiated a new scheme called the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana in April 2005. The \nscheme aims to electrify 125,000 unelectrified villages and give access to 78 million rural \nhouseholds and is being implemented through the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). \nThrough  REC,  the  Government  provides  90%  of  the  capital  cost of  developing  (i)  a  rural \nelectrification distribution backbone with at least one 33/11 kV (or 66/11 kV) substation in each \nblock, (ii) village electrification infrastructure with at least one distribution transformer in each \nvillage or habitation, and (iii) a decentralized distributed generation system where grid supply is \nunfeasible or not cost effective.  \n \n22.  The scheme also emphasizes sustainability of rural supply through collection of the cost \nof electricity from the beneficiaries. To achieve this objective, the Government encourages \nfranchisees  such  as  nongovernment  organizations  and  consumer  associations.  The  state \ngovernments are free to provide appropriate targeted subsidies to poor households.       \n \nD.  Transmission Sector \n \n23.  Key  Opportunities  and  Challenges.  The Indian power system is divided into five \nelectrical  regions\u2014northern,  southern,  western,  eastern,  and  northeastern.  At  present,  all \nexcept the southern region are operating in synchronism. The southern region is connected to \nthe eastern and western regions through asynchronous links.

The Government set out the Integrated Energy Policy (IEP) in August 2006 with a vision \nto reliably meet the demand for energy services of all sectors with safe, clean, and convenient \nenergy in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable manner. \nThe transmission sector will play a pivotal role in (i) ensuring regional energy security through \ninternational grid connection, and as a result enabling the region to avoid overdependence on \nfossil-fuel energy resources, (ii) reducing greenhouse gas emissions by connecting hydropower \nand renewable energy power plants in India and neighboring countries, and (iii) enhancing \nenergy efficiency through technical-loss reduction with the advanced technologies such as high \nvoltage direct current high voltage direct current (HVDC). Under this strategy, coverage of the \ntransmission network will be expanded by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (POWERGRID) \nand the private sector, creating a national grid by adding over 60,000 circuit kilometers (ckm) \nand thus increasing interregional power transfer capacity to more than 37,000 MW by 2012.  \n \n1.  National Power Grid \n \n3.  Except for the eastern and northeastern regions, all the regions are presently facing \npower shortages in the range of about 300\u20136,000 MW. Considering the generation addition \nprogram by 2012, the surplus power in the eastern region will be about 12,000 MW and in the \nnortheastern region about 3,000 MW; the northern, western, and southern regions will need to \nimport power to a large extent from the eastern and northeastern regions to reduce their deficit \nsituation. According to the least-cost generation expansion program and demand projection for \ndifferent regions, the northeastern and eastern region will be the major power exporter for other \nregions. Therefore, development of strong interregional links connecting the northeastern and \neastern regions to all other regions is needed. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  41 \nFigure A3.2: Proposed Interregional Transmission Capacity (MW) by 2012\nMarch 2007         2012\n  0MW  ->        3,000 MW\nNorthern\nInstalled capacity: \n34,701 MW\nPeak availability:\n26,500 MW March  2007       2012\nPeak demand:  4,220 MW   -> 13,620 MW\n31,500 MW\nEastern North-Eastern\nDeficit: \n- 5,000 MW Installed capacity:  Installed capacity: \n16,728 MW 2,404 MW\nPeak availability: Peak availability:\n10,000 MW 1,193 MW\nMarch  2007      2012\nPeak demand:  Peak demand: \n2,080 MW  ->  4,180 MW March 2007    2012 9,200 MW 1,300 MW\n1,760 MW-> 6,600 MW\nDeficit: \nDeficit:  + 500 MW\n-+3,000 MW\nWestern\nMarch 2007    2012\nInstalled capacity: \n37,160 MW March 2007    2012 1,240 MW-> 2,840 MW\n3,120 MW-> 3,620 MW\nPeak availability:\n26,085 MW\nSouthern\nPeak demand: \n32,506 MW Installed capacity: \n36,599 MW\nDeficit:  Peak availability:\n- 6,000 MW 22,360 MW\nPeak demand: \n23,010 MW\nDeficit: \nMarch 2007    2012\n- 740 MW\n1,680 MW-> 3,780 MW\nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.\n \n \n4.  By 2012, the eastern, western, and northern regions will be interconnected by a high \ncapacity 765 kV ring, while the southern region will remain interconnected in asynchronous \nmode. The northeastern region is also expected to be connected with the eastern region with a \nhigh capacity 400 kV AC link and with the northern and western regions with a high capacity \n800 kV HVDC link. This will constitute a stronger national grid with high-capacity transmission \nhighways having total interregional capacity of more than 37,000 MW. Figure A3.2 shows the \nprojected capacity of interregional transmission links in 2012. \n \n2.   Strengthening of Regional Grids and Integrated Grid Operation \n \n5.  Transmission  systems  in  the  five  regional  grids  need  to  be  further  expanded  and \nstrengthened to provide associated transmission systems for the planned generation capacity \naddition of about 78,600 MW during the 11th Five-Year Plan period and to realize optimal \nutilization  of  available  generation  and  the  extra-high  voltage  grid.

The  11th  Five-Year  Plan  aims  to  further  accelerate  the  reforms  and  underpin  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy of Power for All by 2012 through (i) expanding coverage, (ii) improving \nreliability, and (iii) enhancing sustainability and efficiency of the interstate transmission network. \nExpected outcomes and major milestones of the plan are defined in the transmission sector \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nroad map. The sector road map includes specific technical targets to be achieved by 2012 in \nterms of expansion of the national power grid and reliability and efficiency of the grid operations. \nAs POWERGRID is the primary provider of interstate and interregional transmission services, \nthe sector road map also includes various measures to further strengthen POWERGRID\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to achieve the technical targets, based on its long-term corporate strategy. \nThese measures aim to strengthen corporate governance, improve efficiencies, and enhance \nthe  financial  viability  of  POWERGRID  through  (i)  financial  management,  (ii)  safeguard \ncompliance,  (iii)  human  resource  management,  (iv)  information  technology,  and  (v)  cost \nreduction. \n \n  1.  Private Sector Participation \n \n7.   The Government amended Indian Electricity Laws to enable private sector participation \nin  transmission  sector.  In  January  2000,  the  Government  issued  detailed  guidelines.  The \nguidelines envisage two routes for inviting private sector investment. One route is through joint \nventure of central transmission utility/state transmission utility and private sector.  The first joint \nventure has been established by POWERGRID and Tata Power Company Ltd for 1,200 km of \ntransmission lines associated with the Tala Hydro Electric Power in Bhutan on Build-Own-\nOperate Transfer basis. The project was successfully commissioned in August 2006. ADB \nprovided a loan1 for the project through its private sector window. Several joint-venture projects \nare at an advanced stage of selection of investors. The other option is through what is known as \nan  independent  private  transmission  company,  and  this  envisages  100%  private-sector \ninvestment. Part of a system strengthening project in the western region is being implemented \nin this way. POWERGRID plans various joint-venture projects2 between now and 2012. \n \n2.  Financial and Corporate Governance Matters \n \n8.  Appointment  of  Independent  Directors.  Because  its  bonds  are  publicly  listed, \nPOWERGRID is required by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to have at least 50% of \nits board directors as nonexecutive members. Presently, POWERGRID has nine directors \u2014 \nthree  executive  directors  from  POWERGRID  and  six  nonexecutive  directors.  Of  the  six \nnonexecutive directors, two are government directors appointed part-time; the other four are \nindependent directors.  . \n \n9.  Initial Public Offering and Partial Divestment of Government Shares. As per the \ndecision of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in November 2006, the Government has \ndecided to (i) issue shares to the public in three public-sector power companies (POWERGRID, \nthe Rural Electrification Corporation and the Power Finance Corporation) up to 24% of their \npaid-in capital and (ii) to divest itself of 5% of its shares in the companies. POWERGRID invited \nbids for its initial public offering up to 10% of its paid-in capital between 10 and 13 September \n2007. The divestment of the Government shares was planned simultaneously.  These actions \nhave diluted Government ownership in POWERGRID from 100% to about 86.4%. This is a \npositive step in POWERGRID\u2019s corporate governance reform program, as it will encourage \nfurther disclosure of financial information to shareholders, investment professionals, and the \ngeneral public. Public listing creates regular market information on commercial performance and \nmonitoring  by  a  separate  class  of  shareholders  other  than  the  Government  (because \nshareholders have a residual rather than priority claim on the firm\u2019s assets, the value of minority \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila \n2  The following joint-venture projects are planned: with Reliance Energy Ltd for transmission system associated with \nParbati-II (800 MW) and Koldam (800 MW), with Torrent Power Ltd for transmission system associated with \ngeneration project at Sugen (Gujarat), with Jaiprakash Hydro Power Ltd for transmission system associated with \nKarcham  Wangtoo  (1,000  MW)  HEP,  with  Countrywide  Power  Transmission  Ltd  for  transmission  system \nassociated with power projects in Sikkim, and with Essar Power for transmission system associated with power \nproject at Hazira (Gujarat). \n ", "Appendix 3  43 \nshareholders\u2019 investments in the utility depends more strongly on performance of the utility \ncompared with the lenders).   POWERGRID has received enormous response from the bidders \nin all categories. Massive positive market response to the share issue  reflects POWERGRID\u2019s \nexisting corporate governance practices and demonstrated confidence in the company going \nforward on a commercial basis.  \n \n10.  Financial Management. The expansion plan to meet 2012 goals will require increasing \nlevels of debt over the medium term. Based on the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission \n(CERC) tariff norms, POWERGRID is seeking to arrange 70% debt financing for its subprojects. \nSound financial management will, therefore, be very important to maintaining sustainability and \nefficiency of POWERGRID. POWERGRID regularly issues domestic bonds and borrows long-\nterm funds from domestic lenders and multilateral financing institutions such as the World Bank \nand  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  with  Government  guarantees.  POWERGRID  will \nexplore the possibility of borrowing foreign currency loans from ADB and the syndicated bank \nmarket  without  sovereign  guarantee.  POWERGRID  will  develop  relationships  with  the \ncommercial market, which will improve POWERGRID\u2019s visibility and credibility as a reputable \nborrower and enhance its corporate governance. Eventually, it will assist POWERGRID to (i) \nmove  from  Government-guaranteed  lending  to  commercial  borrowing  without  any  credit \nenhancement, and (ii) become a more commercially viable entity. \n \n11.   POWERGRID is exposed to payment risk from state electricity boards (SEBs). While \nthe one-time tripartite agreement settlement in 2004 resolved the past-due receivables and \nprovided incentives for the improvement of current dues of the SEBs, residual risk remains as \nsome SEBs are still loss-making. POWERGRID will maintain its accounts receivable at a level \nnot exceeding an amount equivalent to the income proceeds of its transmission services for the \npreceding 3 months of billable amount, as allowed by CERC. POWERGRID will also obtain \nirrevocable letters  of  credit  from  the  state  electricity  boards  and  other  beneficiaries,  in  an \naggregate amount based on average monthly billings of the previous financial year, as deemed \nacceptable by POWERGRID and as allowed by CERC. \n \n3.  Human Resource Development  \n \n12.  Since the 1990s, POWERGRID has strengthened its human resource management \nfunctions.  As  a  result,  POWERGRID  succeeded  in  enhancing  its  employee  productivity \n(measured by the ratio of manpower to the transmission asset) to international standards. For \nfurther strengthening of human resource management, POWERGRID has been implementing \nfully fledged capacity-development initiatives. This includes (i) optimization of the skill mix, (ii) \nshifting towards a leaner organization, and (iii) expansion of training programs in specialized \nareas for executives, managers, and line workers  \n \n4.  Information Technology \n \n13.  POWERGRID  has  developed  advanced  information  systems  since  1992,  when  an \ninformation system planning study was conducted and a computer-based system was adopted \nat corporate and regional offices. Most business processes are now computerized through in-\nhouse developed applications and web-enabled applications. The key applications currently \ndeployed include finance and payroll, an online grid monitoring system, specialized software \ntools  for  engineering  and  project  management,  enterprise-wide  electronic  messaging,  an \nintranet-based management information system and information dissemination, and various \nother functional reporting systems. To further enhance corporate governance and streamline its \nbusiness processes, POWERGRID plans to integrate corporate-wide information systems. \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \n \n5.  Fiduciary Oversight and Safeguard  \n \n14.  POWERGRID already has a comprehensive internal control mechanism to verify the \naccounting and financial management system, adequacy of controls, material checks, financial \nproperty  aspects,  and  compliance  implementation  mechanism.  POWERGRID  is  further \nstrengthening its fiduciary oversight and safeguard measures through (i) initiatives related to the \nRight to Information Act, (ii) strengthening its compliance mechanism with the introduction of \nenterprise resource planning, and (iii) continuous quality enhancement program through the ISO \nquality assurance system. Under the Right to Information Act, POWERGRID is required to \ndisclose to the public (i) the particulars of its organization, functions, and duties; (ii) the powers \nand duties of its officers and employees; (iii) the procedure followed in its decision-making \nprocess, including channels of supervision and accountability; (iv) the norms set by it for the \ndischarge of its functions; and (v) the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals, and records used \nby its employees for discharging their functions. POWERGRID achieved the distinction of being \nthe first power utility and second company in the world to get certified with PAS 99:2006 \nintegrating the requirements of ISO 9001:2000 (quality management system), ISO 14001:2004 \n(environmental management system) and OHSAS 18001:1999 (occupational health and safety \nmanagement system).3 \n \n15.  POWERGRID  has  introduced  certain  committees  of  independent  eminent  persons \nrelating  to  the following matters:  (i) financial management,4(ii) procurement,  (iii) environmental  \nand social safeguards,5 and (iv) research and development. These committees report directly to \nthe chairman. In order to give more focused attention to certain areas, the board has constituted \nseveral other subcommittees to look at functional matters such as the award of contracts, \nfeasibility reports and revised cost estimates, and bonds. Improvements suggested by the \ncommittees and subcommittees are progressively incorporated into POWERGRID\u2019s procedures. \n \n16.  POWERGRID will enhance its accountability through (i) initial public offering of its shares \nto  the  stock  exchange,  and  (ii)  proposed  conferring  of  Navratna  status  which  enables \nPOWERGRID to make decisions on issues like joint ventures, capital expenditure, and setting \nup of subsidiary firms.  \n \n6.  Cost Reduction  \n \n17.  Although the current regulation allows POWERGRID to earn revenue on a cost-plus \nbasis, continuous cost reduction efforts are critical to prepare for change to the tariff philosophy \nto price-cap methodologies and to provide transmission services to its customers at affordable \ntariffs.  POWERGRID  will  optimize  the  capital  cost  of  transmission  projects  through  (i)  the \nadoption  of  new  technologies  at  the  planning  and  development  stages,  (ii)  an  aggressive \nprocurement strategy to widen supplies and its contract base, (iii) maintaining an appropriate \ncapital structure for project funding, and (iv) ensuring timely implementation of projects. \n                                                 \n3  Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. 2007.

The committee \ncomprises four independent members with administrative, managerial, professional, and academic experience and \nis headed by a former comptroller and auditor-general of India. The committee has reviewed issues such as the \nmobilization of resources, cash management system, financial forecasting, and allocation of common expenditure, \nand made suggestions for further improvement which have been considered by the management. \n5 This committee is headed by the former secretary general of the Worlwide Fund for Nature, and also has the former \ndirector general (forests) from the Ministry of Environment & Forests as environmental specialist, a professor from \nthe Administrative Staff College of India (Hyderabad) as the R&R specialist, and includes E&S specialist members \nnominated by the World Bank and ADB to review POWERGRID\u2019s Environment and Social Policy and Procedures  \nin light of International practices and review POWERGRID\u2019s compliance with the Environment and Social Policy \nand Procedures. \n ", "Appendix 3  45 \n   \n18.  POWERGRID will try to further reduce operation and maintenance costs by (i) managing \nadditions in the transmission system without corresponding increases in human resources, (ii) \nadopting  proper  monitoring  and  control  measures,  and  (iii)  following  a  stringent  regime  of \npreventive and regular maintenance and conservation of energy.  \n \nC.

Introduction \n1.  The Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (POWERGRID) operates in a regulated sector \nwith its return on equity fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). It \nderives  income  from  the  transmission  of  electricity  and  its  primary  source  of  revenue  is \ntransmission tariffs, which are set by CERC on a cost-plus basis with a minimum availability \nrequirement. The current tariff regulation was put into effect on 1 April 2004 and will be revised \nin 2009. As a result of its regulatory oversight, POWERGRID has been consistently profitable \nfor  many  years.  Credit  Rating  Information  Services  of  India  Limited  has  assigned \nPOWERGRID\u2019s long-term bonds a local currency debt rating of AAA stable. It has not yet been \nrated by an international credit rating agency (i.e., no foreign currency issues), but the company \nis in the process of obtaining such a rating as it considers moving into foreign currency debt and \nbond markets.   \n \nB.  Historical Financial Performance \n2.  A summary of historical financial performance is shown in Table A8.1. The most recent \nfinancial results have been analyzed and some of the reasons for its performance and year-on-\nyear  changes  are  indicated.  The  information  has  been  gathered  from  audited  financial \nstatements which were prepared by POWERGRID in accordance with its accounting policies \nwhich conform to Indian generally accepted accounting principles and have been audited by its \nstatutory auditors in accordance with Indian auditing standards. \n \nTable A8.1: Summary of Historical Financial Performance \n(Rs million, unless otherwise stated) \n \nItem   FY2004  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007 \n         \nTotal Operating Revenue  28,054   28,313   35,521   40,823 \nTotal Operating Expenses  11,002   11,143   14,379   14,599 \nNet Profit  7,482   7,855   10,067   12,290 \n         \nCurrent Assets  29,248   26,113   27,241   35,098 \nTotal Fixed Assets  187,989   213,500   249,378   312,693 \nTotal Long-Term Liabilities  122,664   73,357   144,821   185,755 \n         \nNet Profit Margin (%)  27  28  28  30 \nSFR 3-Year Average (%)  29  50  25  33 \nAnnual SFR (%)  33  50  26  30 \n         \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times)  1.90   1.69   1.56   1.72 \nLong-Term Debt-Equity Ratio  59:41  45:55  59:61  63:37 \nAccounts Receivable (months)  2.45  2.15  1.25  1.62 \n  FY = financial year, SFR = self-financing ratio, Rs = Indian rupees. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. (POWERGRID). \n \n3.  In FY2007, POWERGRID generated Rs40.8 billion ($1.02 billion) in revenue and Rs34.5 \nbillion ($860 million) in gross earnings. This was a 15% increase in revenue compared with the \nprevious fiscal year. 82% of revenue was from the transmission business, with the remainder \n ", " 58  Appendix 8 \nbeing generated by the telecom business, international and domestic consultancy work, interest \non bonds, and lease income. This generated a net income of Rs. 12.3 billion ($308 million), up \n22% over the previous fiscal year. Compounded average growth over the past four fiscal years \nwas 13%. Its profit margins for the past four fiscal years have been between 27\u201330%, which is \nrelatively healthy for a regulated business. However, POWERGRID\u2019s profitability growth could \nbe constrained by the pace of capital expenditures, which requires increased borrowings and is \ninherently limited to a fixed rate of return. Its return on equity (ROE) for the past four fiscal years \nhas been between 8% and 10%, due to the expansion program. One would expect the ROE to \neventually  increase  to  around  14%.  However,  POWERGRID\u2019s  potential  to  increase  its \nprofitability lies more in its burgeoning unregulated businesses such as telecommunications \nnetwork expansion and consultancy and advisory work. \n \n4.  POWERGRID has maintained relatively modest debt levels with a debt-equity ratio of \napproximately 60:40 in the past several years; the debt-equity ratio has risen to 64:36 in \nFY2007. POWERGRID\u2019s leverage is likely to gradually increase to keep pace with heavy capital \nexpansion, where projects will generally be financed on the basis of a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. \nTherefore, no significant improvement in the leverage ratios are expected in the medium term. \nAs its revenue is received almost entirely in rupees, POWERGRID has relied on the domestic \nloan and bond market for financing, and it can obtain 13-year tenors for such financing, a \nsubstantial portion of this on bullet repayment terms. \n \n5.  In addition, the company has also relied on long-term foreign debt from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, and this reduces the annual interest expense \nand provides amortization schedules of up to 20 years. Approximately 67% of its outstanding \nlong-term debt is local currency bonds and term loans, and the remaining 33% is foreign \ncurrency loans, almost entirely from multilateral lenders. These foreign currency loans have all \nbeen guaranteed by the Government of India. This composition of debt has provided some \nflexibility in terms of debt servicing; POWERGRID\u2019s debt-service coverage ratio was 1.72 in \nFY2007. \n \n6.  POWERGRID\u2019s main financial risk is the risk of nonpayment by the state electricity \nboards (SEBs), its key receivers of power. While POWERGRID enjoys the benefit of a large \nnumber of regionally diverse SEBs as a portfolio, the inherent weakness of SEB credit is a \ncause for concern. In FY2003, receivables rose to Rs 16.4 billion (288 days). To mitigate this \nrisk and secure past debts, the Government of India signed tripartite agreements with the state \ngovernments and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where 8.5% tax-free bonds were issued by \nRBI for all outstanding dues from state utilities as of 30 September 2001. The bonds have a 5-\nyear grace period and 10-year repayment. Interest on the bonds is paid annually by RBI. \n \n7.  To promote payment discipline on current electricity sales, incentives were put in place \nwhereby rebates on the bond\u2019s face value would be earned if bills were paid on time and letters \nof credit were opened in favor of central power units. As a result, the SEBs presently pay their \nbills on time and receivables have dropped to less than 2 months average sales at the end of \nFY2007. However, this payment discipline is directly linked to the implementation of reforms in \nvarious states and sustainability could be affected, because the incentives have started to be \nphased out starting in FY2007. \n \nC.  Compliance with Financial Loan Covenants \n8.  The last ADB loan to POWERGRID approved in 2004 included the following financial \ncovenants: (i) a long-term debt-equity ratio of 80:20, (ii) a self-financing ratio of 20% of a rolling \n ", "  Appendix 8    59\n3-year average of its actual and planned capital expenditures, (iii) accounts receivable of no \nmore than 2 months average sales, and (iv) establishment of irrevocable letters of credit by SEB \ncustomers  in  favor  of  POWERGRID.  It  is  worth  noting  that  these  financial  covenants  are \nharmonized with other multilateral lenders to POWERGRID. \n \n9.  POWERGRID has a successful track record in complying with these covenants in the \npast several years. As noted above, its long-term debt-equity ratio has remained well below the \ncovenanted level. However, it is gradually increasing its debt to more appropriately mirror the \nCERC-mandated leverage on future investments. The self-financing ratio has averaged 33% for \nthe past 3 fiscal years, and is expected to remain in compliance for the projected period. The \nself-financing  ratio  for  FY2007  was  30%.  However,  annual  capital  expenditure  levels  are \nprojected to increase to keep pace with power generation expansion, which will reduce this ratio \nto an average of 26% over the projected period. While the levels of accounts receivable were a \nserious  concern  prior  to  the  2003  settlement  of  SEB  dues  (see  paras.  6-7),  since  then \nPOWERGRID has complied with the covenanted level due partially to payment incentives put in \nplace for prompt payment. As of 31 August 2006, accounts receivable are less than 1 month of \naverage  sales.  In  addition,  they  are  protected  by  the  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  that  are \ncurrently in place with all SEBs in an amount which now exceeds 100% of average monthly \nturnover. It is proposed to maintain these financial covenants in the proposed loan. \n \nD.  Assumptions on Financial Projections \n10.  Operating revenue is taken from audited financial results for FY2007 and for subsequent \nyears, based on the expected commissioning schedule of transmission assets. POWERGRID \ncomputes its tariffs based on full recovery of the capital cost, inclusive of (i) interest expense \nfrom existing loans, (ii) depreciation in line with CERC guidelines, and (iii) a return on equity \n(fixed at 14%). Operation and maintenance expenses are estimated at 1.4% of capital cost \noutlays with 4% annual escalation. Transmission and administrative charges are projected to \nescalate at the same rate as transmission charges. Operation and maintenance expenses also \ninclude an expected 20% increase in employee remuneration in FY2008 (due to usual 5-year \nwage  revisions).  System  availability  is  assumed  at  98.5%  for  the  purpose  of  determining \nincentive payments. Other income includes consultancy and telecommunications revenue as \nwell as interest income from bonds issued on behalf of the SEBs. Income from transmission \njoint-venture projects is calculated based on a 10% dividend from such equity investments \nbased on the commissioning year of the project. Revenue realization is considered at 95% of \nbilling, with the balance assumed realized after 2 years.   \n \n11.  All new projects are assumed financed on a 70:30 debt-equity ratio, in line with CERC\u2019s \nguidelines. While a certain portion of the capital expenditure plan will be financed from its \ninternal cash flow and retained earnings, the remainder will be borrowed, mainly from Indian \nfinancial institutions and international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. \nGenerally, POWERGRID plans to source (i) 70% of its debt requirements through domestic \nloans (13-year tenors, including 3-year grace, at 9% interest), (ii) 10% through suppliers\u2019 credits \nor external commercial borrowings (13-year tenor, including 3-year grace, at 5% interest), and \n(iii) 20% from ADB and the World Bank (20-year tenor, including 5-year grace, at 4% interest). \nThe financial projections also assume a 3% exchange rate variation per annum on foreign \ncurrency loans, which is charged to the income statement but fully recoverable through the tariff. \nWhile interest rate assumptions may be low, all interest costs are an automatic pass-through in \nthe tariff and would not have a material impact on projections.   \n \n \n ", " 60  Appendix 8 \n12.  As per present tariff norms applicable from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2009, depreciation \nis charged to the income statement using the straight line method at the rates specified under \nthe  CERC  tariff  norms,  which  is  approximately  3%  for  transmission  systems.  The  rate  of \ndepreciation in the tariff is linked to the technical life of transmission assets. To compensate for \nthe possible mismatch between loan repayments and depreciation recovered through the tariff, \nCERC allows for Advance Against Depreciation (AAD) up to 7% per annum considering a debt-\nequity of 70:30 and a loan tenure of 10 years (in addition to depreciation at 3% as mentioned \nabove).  After  repayment  of  loans,  remaining  depreciation  is  readjusted  equally  over  the \nremaining  useful  life  of  the  assets.  Thus,  considering  an  average  life  of  30  years,  the \ndepreciation falls to 1% per annum for the remaining life. AAD is reduced from sales and \nconsidered as deferred revenue to be included in sales in subsequent years. \n \n13.  POWERGRID  pays  taxes  (minimum  alternate  tax  and  dividend  tax)  as  per  rates \nprescribed under applicable Indian Tax Laws. Minimum Alternate Tax is passed through in the \ntransmission tariff as per present tariff norms of CERC.  \n \nE.  Financial Projections and Sensitivity Analysis \n14.  Based on the assumptions explained above, the base-case financial projections (in \nnominal terms) are included in Table A8.2. These projections demonstrate that POWERGRID\u2019s \ncurrent financial position is acceptable and adequately recovers its cost in order to service its \ndebt prudently. Although the projected capital expansion plan is aggressive and will require a \nmuch greater level of borrowings, the financial projections show that POWERGRID will remain \nin compliance with covenanted levels on the long-term debt-equity ratio, accounts receivable, \nand self-financing ratio.  \n \n15.  Based  on  these  results,  the  financial  projections  were  tested  to  determine  their \nsensitivity to major variables and operating drivers that could affect POWERGRID\u2019s viability. \nCertain variables (such as cost overruns, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates) will not \nhave an impact, as these fluctuations are directly passed through in the tariff. It was also \ndiscussed whether there could be a negative cash flow impact from such changes while the \nregulator considered a new petition. However, such changes can be automatically adjusted \nwithout separate approvals, and if not, filings to CERC are made each year. New capital assets \nare included in the regulatory base as soon as they are commissioned. With a cost-plus tariff, \nPOWERGRID does not carry any volume risk, i.e., as long as it meets the availability target, its \ncapital and operating costs are fully compensated. It is not based on an energy component that \ncan vary with throughput on its transmission lines.  \n \n16.  Key variables which could adversely impact POWERGRID\u2019s financial position include: (i) \nSEB receivables; (ii) delays in project implementation, i.e., reduced growth of transmission \nrevenues;  and  (iii)  possible  introduction  of  competition  in  the  transmission  subsector.  The \npossibility of increased receivables from the SEBs is the most likely scenario of the three \nmentioned here, but it should be tempered by the payment discipline which has been in place \nsince 2003. Should SEBs decide not to pay their bills within 90 days, POWERGRID can take \nimmediate action to stop delivering power through its lines. However, if it is assumed that \naccounts receivables on new sales is increased to 6 months, it reduces cash flow only to a \nsmall extent; POWERGRID can still adequately service its debt and meet its financial covenants \nin all years, with the exception of the self-financing ratio in FY2009 and FY2010. It is highly \nunlikely that receivables would be permitted to increase to such a level without the Government \nor regulator stepping in again. \n \n ", "  Appendix 8    61\n17.  Based on past experience in the power sector in India, delays in project implementation \nare moderately likely, as most large transmission projects are directly related to progress on \ngeneration projects which will supply the new capacity. To the extent certain projects are \ndelayed, POWERGRID will naturally postpone some drawdowns of loans and or additional bond \nissues to ensure financial costs are minimized. As previously mentioned, growth in revenues is \nregulated to a 14% return on equity, so delay in such revenue growth will not have a significant \nimpact on projected performance. To some extent, the growth of unregulated business revenue \n(e.g., telecommunications and consulting activities) may mitigate any such delays in capital \nexpenditures.   \n \n18.  Finally, the Electricity Act 2003 and the National Tariff Policy (2006) does allow for some \ncompetition  to  be  introduced  into  the  transmission  subsector,  which  may  permit  other \ncompanies to construct lines based on lowest-cost competitive bids. This process may result in \ntransmission tariffs which are lower than the current tariffs set on a cost-plus basis. However, \nsuch competition would only be introduced on a selective basis no earlier than 2012, when \nPOWERGRID will have already completed (or initiated the final subprojects) a large portion of \nits  transmission  grid  network.  Furthermore,  there  was  an  attempt  by  the  Government  to \nintroduce competition in transmission 2 years ago and it failed to attract any serious interest \nfrom bidders. Therefore, it is unlikely that competition will be introduced in 2012 other than on a \nsmall-scale basis. As it is already the dominant provider of transmission capacity (and the most \nexperienced in constructing such projects), POWERGRID should be able to be compete with \nany other suppliers for future projects and remain at least as viable as with a regulated return on \nequity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nTable A8.2: Summary of POWERGRID Financial Projections \n(Rs million) \n \n6\n2\nItem   2007/08 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11  2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15  \nBalance Sheet Summary                   \nCurrent Assets  28,030  30,987  32,971  36,325  38,819   40,422  49,529  49,842  44,110  A\np\nTotal Fixed Assets  351,496  448,106  562,777  673,354  760,579   848,296  885,290  936,127  966,291  p\ne\nn\nCurrent Liabilities  59,738  69,372  76,823  81,451  84,986   87,446  90,448  96,995  99,260  d\nix\nNon-Current Liabilities  209,490  283,791  376,821  466,223  529,591   589,676  602,103  613,527  602,362   8\n \nTotal Equity  122,987 138,259 153,605 172,157 193,363  218,110 246,754 278,042 311,375\n                   \nIncome Statement Summary                   \nTotal Revenues  48,497  66,680  76,209  93,356  107,715   117,704  124,905  129,002  131,621 \nTotal Expenses  17,019  21,038  24,697  29,177  33,264   35,427  36,633  37,746  38,937 \nTotal Financial Charges  13,935  19,058  24,815  31,916  37,631   39,403  38,739  37,152  35,050 \nProfit Before Tax  17,543  26,585  26,697  32,263  36,820   42,874  49,533  54,105  57,634 \nTax  1,968  2,983  2,995  3,620  4,131   4,810  5,558  6,071  6,467 \nProfit After Tax  15,575  23,602  23,701  28,643  32,689   38,063  43,975  48,034  51,168 \n                   \nCash Flow Summary                   \nOperating Cash Flow (Post Tax)  43,517  63,623  70,859  82,111  94,401   102,322  108,498  114,837  112,096 \nPlanned Capital Expenditures  64,997  111,894  132,120  130,768  110,040   111,147  60,508  74,350  53,678 \nCash Available for Debt Service  31,100  38,192  44,560  57,953  67,097   76,132  92,374  94,422  95,993 \nDebt Service     24,460  29,448  35,827  47,388  55,272   62,543  68,956  78,087  84,122 \nDividend Paid  5,328  8,074  8,108  9,798  11,182   13,020  15,043  16,431  17,503 \nNet Cash Increase (Decrease)  1,313  669  626  767  643   569  8,375  (97) (5,632)\n                   \nFinancial Ratios                   \nProfit Margin (%)  32 35 31 31 30  32 35 37 39\nGross Margin (%)  65 68 68 69 69  70 71 71 70\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (Times)  1.94 2.20 2.02 1.88 1.84  1.77 1.70 1.59 1.46\nLong-Term Debt-Equity Ratio  63:37 67:33 71:29 73:27 73:27  73:27 71:29 69:31 66:34\nAccounts Receivable (Months)  1.18 1.17 1.18 1.15 1.18  1.20 1.21 1.21 1.25\nSFR 3-Year Average (%)  20 27 23 21 25  30 22 35 27\nAnnual SFR (%)  24 25 21 20 27  25 30 30 30\nSFR = self-financing ratio, Rs = Indian rupees. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.

The financial analysis of the proposed subprojects under tranche 1 has been carried out \nin  accordance  with  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 1 of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). All financial costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant \n2006 price level. Cost streams used for the purposes of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \ndetermination (i.e., capital investment and operations and maintenance) reflect the costs of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. The current transmission tariff scheme was used to estimate \nthe financial benefits.  \n \nB.  Methodologies and Major Assumptions \n \n2.  The project involves several subprojects. These individual subprojects are not stand-\nalone investments and would not yield benefits if considered in isolation from a number of other \nprojects. Therefore, the financial analysis was conducted using a time-slice approach for the \nentire 11th Five-Year Plan of the Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (POWERGRID). Hence \nthe financial viability of the overall investment program during the period 2007\u20132012 (of which \nthe subprojects to be financed under the investment program are part of) has been assessed. \nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is also calculated for the overall investment \nprogram  to  be  financed  by  POWERGRID  and  was  compared  with  FIRR  to  ascertain  the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  investment  program.  Price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction were excluded in the estimation of capital costs for the purpose of the FIRR, which \nis at 2006 constant prices.  \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of \nwith-investment and without-investment scenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the \nincreased  transmission  of  power  through  the  transmission  system  due  to  removal  of \ntransmission constraints as a result of the investment. Installing additional transformers and line \nextensions and the construction of new grid substations removes the bottlenecks that prevent \navailable generation capacity from being transmitted. Incremental operating and maintenance \ncosts have been computed as a percentage of the investment. It is assumed that the investment \nwill have a 30-year economic life and residual value of Rs 46.3 billion at the end of that life. \n \n4.  The principles of tariff set by the regulatory agency (the Central Electric Regulatory \nCommission [CERC]) allow POWERGRID to pass through the full cost recovery of the loan \ncapital (debt-equity ratio of 70:30), depreciation (straight line), return on equity (14%), operation \nand maintenance expenses (based on fixed coefficient), and interest (based on short-term rates \nof the State Bank of India) on working capital.   \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n5.  To  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \nPOWERGRID\u2019s equity contribution financed through retained earnings and a combination of \nforeign and local currency loans. Based on the expectations and POWERGRID\u2019s historical cost \nof borrowing, the foreign and local currency loans earmarked for POWERGRID are assumed to \ncarry different nominal interest rates. The cost of POWERGRID\u2019s equity is calculated at 14% as \nallowed by CERC tariff norms for pass-through. The other assumptions are a domestic inflation \nrate of 4.4% and an international inflation rate of 1.5%. As shown in Table A9.1, the WACC for \nthe investment program during the period 2007\u20132012 is 5.2%. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

The  variables  considered  for  the \nsensitivity analyses were a 1-year implementation delay, a 20% increase in capital costs, and a \n20% increase in operation and maintenance costs (Table A9.3). As the principles of tariff allow \nPOWERGRID projects to pass through full cost-recovery of (i) the loan capital, (ii) depreciation, \n(iii) return on equity, (iv) operation and maintenance expenses, and (v) interest on working \ncapital, the differences of the options are marginal.

Background and Approach \n \n1.  Under the 10th and 11th five-year plans (2002 to 2012), Power Grid Corporation of India \nLimited (POWERGRID) is focusing on the creation of a national grid in a phased manner by \nadding over 60,000 circuit km of transmission line so that the integrated national grid can \nevacuate  additional  100,000  MW  and  carry  60%  of  the  power  generated  in  the  country, \nincreasing inter-regional power transfer capacity from 11,500 MW at present to 37,150 MW \n(according  to  the  Draft  National  Electricity  Plan  (Transmission)).  This  National Power  Grid \nDevelopment Program will require an investment of Rs. 800 billion ($17.4 billion), out of which \nPOWERGRID is expecting to invest Rs 181 billion ($3.4 billion) during the 10th (current) plan \nand is planning an investment of Rs 550 billion ($12.0 billion) in the 11th plan. \n \n2.  Despite its relatively strong financial capacity, it will be a challenge for POWERGRID to \nraise sufficient funds in the domestic debt and equity markets to complete the Investment \nProgram by 2012. Therefore, a significant part of funding is expected to come from foreign \nsources such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. Out of a total foreign \nfunding requirement of $3.7 billion for the 11th Plan, foreign funding of $ 3.0 billion is yet to be \ncommitted. India\u2019s open access transmission network and the associated bilateral contracts \nmarket is in its infancy. The private sector is understandably adopting a cautious approach to \ncommitting  capital  to  an  unproven  market.  This  places  the  onus  on  the  public  sector  to \ndemonstrate the market\u2019s viability and thus provides the rationale and justification for ongoing \npublic sector intervention. The ADB\u2019s involvement can help bring down the total cost of funds to \nPOWERGRID and ultimately the transmission component of tariff to end-users. This provides \nthe context and rationale for ADB\u2019s proposed intervention. \n \n3.  The economic analysis of the POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program under the \n11th  Plan  (2008  \u2013  2012)  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. A time-slice approach was adopted, with the entire transmission \nand (grid-connected) generation investment program considered. This was done to avoid the \ndifficulties  inherent  in  allocating  costs  and  particularly  benefits  to  individual  transmission \nprojects. Moreover, investments in inter-regional, intra-regional and inter-state transmission flow \nfrom and are inseparable from the National Electricity Plan (Generation).  \n \nB.  Demand Forecast \n \n4.  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) prepares national electricity demand forecasts, \nusing a model called Electric Power Survey (EPS). The latest EPS, the 16th, was carried out in \n1999 and the results of the survey were published in September 2000.1  The EPS employs both \ntop-down and bottom-up forecasting techniques. A recent review saw a slight decrease in \nforecast growth rates in all regions except for the Western Region. The current Draft National \nElectricity Plan (Transmission) uses the revised forecast. Table A10.1 shows regional forecast \npeak demand at the start and end of the 11th Plan, along with planned peak availability of \ngeneration. The surpluses deficits shown in the last three columns are prior to any inter-regional \npower flows. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The 17th EPS has recently been completed but results have not yet been made public. CEA has confirmed verbally \nthat neither the demand forecasting methodology nor the forecasts have changed materially over the 16th EPS. \n ", "  Appendix 10  67\nTable A10.1: Forecast Regional Demand and Supply \n(MW) \n \nSurplus/Deficit\nPeak Demand Peak Availability before Interregional Transmission\nYear Region Winter Summer Monsoon Winter Summer Monsoon Winter Summer Monsoon\n2007\nWest 36,060 36,060 32,454 33,833 33,658 33,483 (2,227) (2,402) 1,029\nNorth 31,210 31,210 28,089 25,320 28,408 30,132 (5,890) (2,802) 2,043\nNortheast 1,510 1,510 1,359 1,536 1,890 2,067 26 380 708\nEast 9,890 9,890 8,901 15,885 16,104 16,323 5,995 6,214 7,422\nSouth 26,690 25,356 24,021 23,340 24,515 25,136 (3,350) (841) 1,115\n2012\nWest 51,770 51,770 46,593 46,312 45,508 44,704 (5,458) (6,262) (1,889)\nNorth 44,820 31,210 28,089 36,052 42,222 45,900 (8,768) 11,012 17,811\nNortheast 2,160 2,160 1,944 4,605 6,570 7,797 2,445 4,410 5,853\nEast 13,240 13,240 11,916 25,753 25,685 25,616 12,513 12,445 13,700\nSouth 38,310 36,395 34,479 34,886 35,633 35,772 (3424) (762) 1,293\n( ) = negative.\nSources: CEA and staff estimates.  \n \nC.  Least Cost Planning \n \n5.  At the national and regional levels, generation and transmission planning are integrated \nand  coordinated  by  CEA,  using  inputs  from  public  and  private  sector  generation  and \ntransmission entities. At this level, planning is concerned with solving the objective function of \nproviding electricity to points of demand at the lowest possible cost. Modeling and analysis \ntakes into account and compares fuel transport costs and electricity transmission costs. In other \nwords, the approach aims to determine the least cost means of supplying consumers with \nelectricity.  The  National  Electricity  Plan  (Generation)  and  the  National  Electricity  Plan \n(Transmission) can therefore be considered to be least cost plans. The planning approach \nadopted by POWERGRID derives an integrated transmission plan using both top-down and \nbottom-up  inputs.  Development  of  the  transmission  plan  is  iterative;  various  input  (power \nstation) scenarios and off-take (grid substation) scenarios are modeled and analyzed, with the \nultimate intention being the identification of the lower cost means of developing the transmission \nnetwork  under  a  reasonable  range  of  scenarios.  In  this  sense,  the  transmission  network \ndevelopment plan encapsulated in the proposed investment program is the least cost means of \nachieving a desired set of electricity transmission outcomes.  \n \nD.  Program Costs \n \n6.  All costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant 2006 price level. The domestic \nprice numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent value \n(BPEV) and were converted to domestic equivalents using an estimated standard exchange \nrate factor (SERF) of 1.05. Capital costs included physical contingencies, but excluded taxes, \nprice contingencies and financial charges during construction. \n \n7.  A \u201cwith program\u201d and \u201cwithout program\u201d test was employed to assess the inclusion or \nexclusion of various capital and operating costs. The \u201cwith program\u201d scenario assumes that the \nNational  Electricity  Plan  will  be  implemented,  with  the  focus  on  an  all-India  resource \nmaximization,  development  of  shared  generation  capacity,  and  strengthened  inter-regional \ncapacity as per POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program under the 11th Plan. Under the \n\u201cwithout program\u201d scenario, it was assumed that no further investment in generation capacity \n ", "68  Appendix 10 \nwould take place beyond expenditure that is already committed (taken as all expenditure up to \nand including 2009), and no further investment in inter-regional, intra-regional and state-level \ntransmission would be made. \n \n8.  Capital costs for inter-regional transmission were taken from POWERGRID\u2019s investment \nplan, with appropriate adjustments to remove taxes, financing costs and price contingencies. \nSpecific (overnight) capital costs for thermal (coal-fired) and hydropower generation capacity \nwere  assumed  equivalent  to  the  all-India  planning  parameters  of  Rs  40,000  per  kW \n(approximately  $930/kW)  and  Rs  50,000  per  kW  (approximately  $1,160/kW)  respectively. \nCapacity  additions  were  taken  from  the  National  Electricity  Plan  (Transmission),  with  the \ninvestment assumed to precede the capacity addition by one year. Investments in generation \nmade before 2009 were assumed to be already committed and therefore common to both the \n\u201cwith program\u201d and \u201cwithout program\u201d scenarios. On the basis of advice from CEA, provisions \nwere included for downstream (state-level) transmission and distribution investments required to \nrelieve  any  constraints  in  delivering  peak  generation  (Rs420  billion  and  Rs1030  billion  for \ntransmission and distribution respectively). An operation and maintenance cost allowance of \n1.5% of capital costs was assumed for new transmission and distribution equipment, and an \nallowance 0.75% of capital cost was assumed for new hydropower plant (again, on the basis of \nadvice from CEA).  \n \n9.  It  is  generally  acknowledged  that  significant  investment  is  required  in  downstream \ndistribution systems to improve supply quality and reliability and to reduce losses. Investments \nin supply reliability tend to be localized and do not typically part of the National Electricity Plan. \nTherefore, whilst a provision has been made for capital and operating costs associated with \nrelieving  downstream  capacity  constraints,  the  benefits  of  system  reliability  improvements, \nautomation and non-technical loss reduction were not included in the analysis and consequently \nrelated capital and operating costs were estimated and excluded. \n \nE.  Program Benefits \n \n10.  The main economic benefits of the proposed investments are incremental consumption, \ndisplaced thermal electricity and displaced self-generation from diesel plant. Based on the inter-\nregional transmission capacity that will be added through the investment program, and demand \nand generation capacity and plant factor forecasts contained in the National Electricity Plan \n(Transmission), expected inter-regional power flows for winter, monsoon and summer peak and \noff-peak periods were estimated for the period 2012-2018 (i.e. after all 11th Plan investments \nhave been made). Incremental demand served and resource cost saved was estimated by \nsubtracting power flows in the \u201cwithout program\u201d scenario from the \u201cwith program\u201d scenario, and \nconverting these flows to energy by applying appropriate load factors.2 Growth in demand for \nelectricity beyond year 2018 was excluded from benefit estimation. \n \n11.  Non-incremental outputs were valued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if \nthe investment program was to proceed. Resource cost saving was only assumed to occur \nwhen: \n \n                                                 \n2  It was assumed that peak periods last for 3 hours per day, and each season (winter, monsoon and summer) last \nfor four months each. \n ", "  Appendix 10  69\n  (i)  thermal  generation  that  would  have  been  required  to  meet  demand  in  the \n\u201cwithout  program\u201d  scenario  is  replaced  with  hydropower  generation  from  the \neastern and northeastern regions in the \u201cwith program\u201d: scenario; and \n(ii)  demand that would otherwise have been met from the 25GW of existing captive \ndiesel plant is displaced by grid electricity.3 \n \n12.  Coal fuel for thermal power plants was initially valued at its BPEV, based on the World \nBank\u2019s coal price forecast and adjusted for the generally lower quality of coal used for power \ngeneration in India. Typical loading and transport costs, excluding taxes, were added to base \ncoal prices to derive a 2007 BPEV of Rs2,400/tonne. Marginal operating costs of existing coal \nplant were estimated based on actual historical operating parameters contained in the most \nrecent tariff petition for a representative public sector generating company.  Total marginal \nthermal plant operating costs in 2007 for electricity delivered at the power station gate was \ncalculated to be Rs2.1/kWh, with an overall levelised variable cost of Rs1.8/kWh. Marginal costs \nof captive diesel plant were based on an estimated BPEV of diesel of Rs 18.9 per liter, specific \nconsumption of 0.3 liters/kWh, non-fuel O&M of Rs0.3/kWh specific capital cost of Rs30,000/kW \nand a 10 year life. This gave a total variable cost of Rs6.0/kWh and a total levelised cost for new \nplant of Rs9.4/kWh. \n \n13.  Incremental outputs were valued using consumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay for \nincremental consumption, adjusted for medium voltage and low voltage losses as appropriate. \nFor domestic consumption, a demand function relating energy price to energy demand was \nestimated  for  each  of  the  five  regions  considered  in  national  generation  and  transmission \nplanning (North, West, South, Northeast, and East). The methodology outlined in ADB\u2019s ERD \nTechnical Note No. 3 \u201cMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity\u201d was followed. Two or more \ndata points were used for each region, adjusted for suppressed demand.   Regression analysis \nwas used to derive the five domestic demand functions. On the basis of these demand functions \nand the incremental consumption that will be enabled by the planned power sector investment \nprogram, domestic willingness to pay was estimated for each region.4 \n \n14.  The same approach was used to estimate demand functions for industrial, commercial \nand  agricultural  sectors.  State-level  gross  output  was  included  as  an  addition  regression \nvariable when deriving demand functions. Based on these demand functions, willingness to pay \nfor  incremental  consumption  was  estimated  on  a  regional  basis  for  the  industrial  and \ncommercial sectors, and on a national basis for the agricultural sector.5   \n \n                                                 \n3  CEA\u2019s General Review 2006 indicates a total 2004-2005 installed capacity of captive plant in the industrial sector \nof 19.1 GW, with 7.1 GW of that coming from diesel plant. Steam plant (8.9 GW), gas plant (2.9 GW) and wind \nturbines (0.1 GW) make up the balance. The General Review 2006 estimated total generation from this captive \ndiesel plant of 12,000 GWh in 2004\u20132005. CEA does not include smaller diesel plant (less than 1 MW) in its \nreview, but has verbally indicated it estimates an installed capacity of sub 1 MW diesel sets of 16\u201320 GW, running \nfor an average of 2 hours per day. \n4  2008 willingness to pay estimates for domestic consumers were Rs3.4/kWh (West region), Rs2.8/kWh (North \nregion), Rs5.1/kWh (Northeast region), Rs2.0/kWh (South region) and Rs1.0/kWh (East region).   \n5  Willingness to pay estimates for industrial consumers were Rs5.3/kWh (West region), Rs6.0/kWh (North region), \nRs6.0/kWh (Northeast region), Rs5.8/kWh (South region), and Rs6.0/kWh (East region). Willingness to pay \nestimates for commercial consumers were Rs4.3/kWh (West region), Rs4.5/kWh (North region), Rs2.5/kWh \n(Northeast region), Rs4.3/kWh (South region), and Rs3.7/kWh (East region). Willingness to pay estimates for \ncommercial consumers were Rs4.3/kWh (West region), Rs4.5/kWh (North region), Rs2.5/kWh (Northeast region), \nRs4.3/kWh (South region), and Rs3.7/kWh (East region). \n ", "70  Appendix 10 \nF.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n15.  The basis for investment program economic evaluation is a comparison of benefits and \ncosts between the \u201cwith program\u201d scenario and the \u201cwithout program\u201d scenario. As discussed \nabove, upstream generation and relevant downstream transmission and distribution costs were \nincluded in the analysis. A period of 25 years has been used for economic evaluation, including \nfive years of capital investment and construction. Investment is assumed to take place in the \nperiod 2008-2012, and benefits are assumed to be realized progressively from year 2009. \nResidual  values  were  estimated  for  equipment  on  the  basis  of  60  year  economic  life  for \nhydropower  assets,  50  years  for  POWERGRID  transmission,  40  years  for  state-level \ntransmission and distribution and 30 years for thermal plant. Variable generation cost is zero \nuntil year 2013, before which time incremental thermal generation is lower in the \u201cwith program\u201d \ncase than the \u201cwithout program\u201d case (i.e. a resource cost saving).  \n \n16.  The detailed cost-benefit calculations show that the overall investment program during \nthe 11th Plan is economically viable, with an estimated EIRR of 13.1%. This is considered to be \na robust return given the size of the investment program considered. Economic cost and benefit \nflows for the investment program are shown in Table A10.2.  \n \nTable 10.2: EIRR Calculation \n \nBenefits (Rs million) Costs (Rs million)\nNon- Capital State-Level Operating\nIncremental Incremental POWERGRID Transmission Variable Fixed Transmission Net\nYear Output Output Generation Transmission and Distribution Generation Generation and Distribution Benefits\n2008 0 0 0 50,584 311,272 0 0 0 (361,857)\n2009 23,824 35,924 0 84,988 300,407 0 0 5,428 (331,075)\n2010 59,542 93,159 495,750 96,295 289,920 0 0 11,209 (740,472)\n2011 82,502 135,113 493,100 91,627 279,800 0 8,401 17,002 (672,315)\n2012 104,827 179,746 345,300 74,307 270,033 0 15,123 22,573 (442,764)\n2013 161,912 225,759 0 0 0 11,419 19,547 27,739 328,966\n2014 215,005 264,073 0 0 0 66,529 19,547 27,739 365,264\n2015 261,971 294,921 0 0 0 124,361 19,547 27,739 385,246\n2016 296,416 328,881 0 0 0 158,008 19,547 27,739 420,003\n2017 326,253 366,244 0 0 0 176,263 19,547 27,739 468,949\n2018 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2019 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2020 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2021 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2022 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2023 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2024 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2025 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2026 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2027 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2028 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2029 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2030 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2031 354,365 393,217 0 0 0 195,249 19,547 27,739 505,047\n2032 354,365 393,217 (629,394) (218,791) (635,002) 195,249 19,547 27,739 1,988,233\nEIRR 13.1%\n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, T&D = transmission and distribution.\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates.  \n \n17.  Economic  benefit  flow  is  financial  and  institutionally  sustainable.  POWERGRID  is \nexperienced and well staffed. POWERGRID is subject to and is supported by a transparent \ntariff-setting regime that permits full recovery of efficient costs. This tariff regime will ensure that \nPOWERGRID can implement its proposed investment program in the knowledge that capital \n ", "  Appendix 10  71\nand operating are recoverable and that it will earn an acceptable return on capital. 6  Investment \nfunds  will  come  from  various  sources  including  internally  generated  funds,  a  public  share \noffering, ADB, the World Bank, bilateral donors and lenders, the private sector and through \ndomestic bonds and loans. \n \nG.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n \n18.  The risks for the project to achieve the above EIRR are identified from both cost and \nbenefit side. Cost side risks include delay in program implementation, increases in capital and \noperating costs, and increases in state-level transmission and distribution costs. On the benefit \nsides, consumers\u2019 WTP is derived from the forecasts of their electricity demands in the coming \nyears.  If  the  country  experiences  significantly  lower  economic  growth  which  dampens  the \ndemand for electricity, consumers\u2019 WTP and the program benefits would be lower.    \n \n19.  For each of the risks identified, the sensitivity of the EIRR was tested, including capital \nand operating cost assumptions, willingness to pay values, and program timing. In all cases with \nthe exception of the combined scenario the EIRR exceeds 11.5%. Based on these results, the \noverall  investment  program  appears  to  be  economically  robust  and  delivers  acceptable \neconomic returns over a range of input assumptions. Results are show in Table A10.3 below. \nNote that EIRR increases with increasing cost of generation as the resource cost saving benefit \noutweighs the additional generation cost to serve incremental consumption. \n \nTable A10.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n \nSwitching\nSensitivity Parameter Variation EIRR Value\nBase case 13.1\n1 General Capital Cost Increase 10 11.9        9.2\n2 State T&D Capital Cost Increase 25 11.6      18.7\n3 WTP Reduce (10) 12.3 (13.3)\n4 Cost of Generation Increase 10 13.8 (17.3)\n5 O&M Increase 10 13.0      77.0\n6 Delay 1 year 11.5\n7 Combined 10.2\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M = operations and maintenance; T&D = \ntransmission and distribution; WTP = willingness to pay.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nH.  Distribution Analysis \n \n20.  The distribution of costs and benefits amongst stakeholders was assessed by comparing \nfinancial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits. Constant price financial cash flows \nfrom the investment program were estimated and discounted at 12% to estimate present values \nof cost and benefit streams. Constant price economic cost and benefit streams were also \ndiscounted  at  12%,  and  the  differences  between  financial  and  economic  present  values, \nrepresenting gains and losses to stakeholders, were calculated. Analysis was undertaken on a \npre-financing basis and as such lenders were not included as stakeholders. Income tax was \nexcluded from the analysis \n                                                 \n6  Financial sustainability and tariff setting are discussed in Appendix 8. \n ", "72  Appendix 10 \n \n21.  Table  A10.4  summarizes  the  gains  and  losses  to  stakeholders  for  the  investment \nprogram. Financial benefits accrue to POWERGRID and other power sector companies as \nassets  are  brought  into  service  and  added  to  the  regulated  asset  base  (in  the  case  of \ntransmission  and  distribution  companies)  or  begin  generating  electricity.  However,  as  the \nestimated average power sector financial return is less than 12%, it suffers a loss when its net \nfinancial benefit streams are discounted at 12%. On the other hand, the economy gains overall \nfrom the investment program, and the difference between the financial net present value and \neconomic  net  present  value  (Rs  845  billion)  is  distributed  between  electricity  consumers, \nunskilled labor the government. From an economic perspective, benefits accrue to consumers \nas  energy  is  consumed  incrementally.  Some  of  the  benefit  of  resource  cost  savings  also \naccrues to consumers as more expensive energy sources are displaced.  The sum of these \nbenefits is greater than the incremental financial costs to consumers, and therefore consumers \nare net beneficiaries. Government of India is a net beneficiary due to reduction in imported \nenergy costs and tax revenues, more than offsetting the loss arising from the over-valued \nexchange rate. Finally, small gains are made by unskilled labor as the assumed wage paid is \nhigher than the willingness to work. \n \nTable A10.4: Distribution of Program Effects \n(Rs million) \nNPVs at 12% Distribution to Affected Groups\nPower Electricity \nItem Economic Financial Difference Sector Economy Labor Consumers\nBenefits\n  Incremental consumption        8 19,404       819,404         819,404\n  Resource cost saving     1 ,734,560    1,734,560            68,391      1,666,169\n  Power sector revenue 0      1,944,996 (1,944,996) (1,944,996)\nCosts\n  Investment     2 ,056,628      2,274,148 (217,520)          217,520\n   Unskilled labor          5 4,955           73,274 (18,318)       18,318\n   Operation and maintenance        2 50,253         250,253 0 0\nNet benefits        1 92,128         652,679       844,806     652,679          285,911       18,318         540,577\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nI.  Conclusion \n \n22.  The economic analysis confirms that the overall 11th Plan power sector investment \nprogram, of which POWERGRID\u2019s proposed investment program forms a part, is least cost and \nis economically viable. The analysis yields an EIRR of 13.1% Sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.

The proposed Investment Program is part of the $13.75 billion investment plan and will \nexpect to have two Projects for ADB funding. Project-I \u201cUpgradation of Transmission Capacity \nfrom Uttarakhand\u201d is to provide adequate transmission arrangement for evacuation and reliable \ntransfer of power generated from Tehri Valley in the state of Uttarakhand to constituents of the \nnorthern  region.

The telegraph authority shall do as little damage as possible, \nand, when it has exercised those powers in respect of any property other than that referred to, shall pay full \ncompensation to all persons interested for any damage sustained by them by reason of the exercise of those \npowers. Incase of property and dispute other than that of a local authority where the power is to be exercised, the \nDistrict Magistrate may, in his discretion, order that the telegraph authority shall be permitted to exercise them. \n \n ", "76   Appendix 11 \n         \nPolicy Principle  NPRR  ESPP  ADB  Remarks \n7.

The  EA  will  conduct  consultations  in  affected  villages  to  explain  the \nresettlement plan in coordination with village/community leaders. Each AP will be provided \ninformation regarding specific entitlements.  \n \n13.  For the implementation of CPTD, which is applicable to transmission lines, the GRC \nprocess is in built in the process of compensation because after the notice the revenue officials \nassess the damages based on actual site condition and the version of land owner. After the \npreliminary assessment owner is given a chance to substantiate the claim if he is not satisfied \nwith the assessment. If the owner is not satisfied he/she is allowed to access the higher \nauthority for any grievance towards compensation that is generally addressed in open forum \nand in the presence of many witnesses. Process of spot verification and random checking by \nthe  district  collector  also  provides  forum  for  raising  the  grievance  towards  any \nirregularity/complain. Apart from this POWERGRID officials also listen to the complaints of \naffected farmers and the same are forwarded to revenue official for doing the needful. \n \nE.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n14.  Internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the EA and engaged Social Organization. \nThe  EA  internal  monitoring  will  include:  (i)  administrative  monitoring:  daily  planning, \nimplementation, feed back and trouble shooting, individual AP file maintenance, and progress \nreports; (ii) socio-economic monitoring: evacuation, demolition, salvaging materials, community \nrelationships,  dates  for  consultations,  and  number  of  appeals  placed;  and  (iii)  post-\nimplementation  impact  evaluation  monitoring:  income  standards  restored/improved,  and \nsocioeconomic conditions of the APs.  \n \n15.  Monitoring and evaluation reports documenting progress on resettlement implementation \nand RP/CPTD completion reports will be provided by the EA to ADB for review. \n \n16.  The EA will engage the services of an independent agency not associated with project \nimplementation to undertake external monitoring and evaluation. The external agency, with \nprevious  experience  in  resettlement  activities  and  familiarity  with  the  related  resettlement \npolicies, will be engaged with ADB concurrence within three months of the loan effectiveness. \nThey will monitor RP implementation to determine whether goals have been achieved, livelihood \nand living standards have been restored, and provide recommendations for improvement. The \nexternal monitoring will undertake monthly monitoring and impact evaluation on a sample basis \nduring mid-term and project completion. Monitoring will also ensure recording AP views on \nresettlement issues; AP understanding of entitlement policies, options, and alternatives; site \nconditions; compensation disbursement; grievance redress procedures; and staff competencies. \nThe external monitor will also evaluate the performance of the EA, and Soc.Orgs. The external \nagency will report its findings simultaneously to the EA and to ADB twice a year. Provisions \nhave been made in the resettlement budget component for engaging an external monitor. The \ninternal monitoring report will be submitted quarterly to the India Resident Mission (INRM) for \nreview where as the external monitoring report will be submitted yearly to the INRM for review. \n \nF.

The Project, by \nfocusing on strengthening and expansion of the interregional and intraregional transmission systems of the Power \nGrid Corporation of India, Limited (POWERGRID), is expected to reduce system losses, which in turn will improve \nfrequency and voltage levels, and ultimately reduce wear on electrical equipment. This will lead to more efficient use \nof resources and make more power available to increase electrification outreach. In addition, it will facilitate efficient \nutilization of existing and planned power plants. The strengthening of the sector in the selected states will result in \nefficient delivery of services to consumers. Profitability and efficiency in the farming as well as other sectors is \nexpected to improve with improvements in quality and reliability of power supply with effective restructuring.

Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention     \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project is expected to result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. The improved frequency and voltage \nwill boost the industry and agriculture sectors, leading to enhanced production and improved economic development. \nNo direct impact on poverty is expected, considering that this project will strengthen the interregional grid. \n \nThe sample subprojects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor during their \nimplementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly for the construction of transmission lines, substations, and \nother manual works. There will also be the opportunity for employment for the post-construction phase, especially for \nmaintenance. \n \n \nC.         Participation Process   \n \nIs there a stake holder analysis? Yes  \n \nParticipation during project preparation. Since no impact and no direct beneficiaries are expected due to the \nimplementation of the first tranche, nonstakeholder analysis was undertaken. Nevertheless, POWERGRID, under the \nfuture tranches, will undertake a full social assessment of all the stakeholders which will include consultations with \nlocal officials and village leaders and all the affected communities. This approach is expected to raise the level of \nawareness, build local support, and enable affected people to voice opinions and suggestions for project design and \nimplementation. The poor, women, and other vulnerable groups will be carefully considered in conducting participatory \nactivities. As part of the social assessment, stakeholder consultations in the project areas will be carried out with the \nbroad objective of ensuring extensive participation of all types of stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participatory strategy? Yes \n \nParticipation and consultation are based on a two-way information flow, from project authorities to people and from \npeople to project authorities. Participation, consultation, and information dissemination will be incorporated at several \nlevels during planning of subprojects under future tranches. As part of the project preparation, to ensure that \ncommunity support is obtained and the project supports the needs of the affected persons; public consultations were \ncarried out as an integral component. Continuous involvement of the stakeholders and the affected community was \nobtained. The feedback received from the consultation brought substantial inputs into the project preparation. \nInteracting with people and eliciting feedback allows affected populations to influence the decision-making process by \nraising issues that should be considered in design, mitigation, monitoring, and management plans and the analysis of \nalternatives.  The  Executing  Agency  will  ensure  that  essential  participation  focuses  will  be  adhered  to  during \nimplementation. These will involve local groups in (i) preparing final compensation listings and individual claim files; (ii) \nthe payment of compensation for acquired land and loss of assets and livelihood; (iii) participation in any grievance \nredress; and (iv) participation in the monitoring and evaluation process during implementation of the resettlement plan. \n ", "84  Appendix 12 \n \nD.
