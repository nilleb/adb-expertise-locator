It  includes \ninvestment \nin  equipment  and  machinery,  systems  and \ninformational  technology,  and  rehabilitation  of  breakwater  and \nberths.    \n \nThe port of Poti is an integral nodal point of the east\u2013west transport \ncorridor connecting Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia. The \nfinancial  assistance  will  help  to  modernize  and  augment  this  key \ntransport  link,  resulting  in  increased  and  more  efficient  regional \ntrade. This will lead to greater economic growth in the region and \ncloser regional integration in the Caucasus and Central Asia. It will \nalso promote private sector participation and bring investment and \ntechnical expertise to a critical infrastructure asset. \n \nPSPC  is  the  borrower.  PSPC  was  established  in  1858  and  has \nbeen  historically  owned  by  the  state.  In  2008,  PSPC  underwent \nprivatization  through  an  international  competitive  bidding  process. \nThe  winning  bidder  was  Ras  Al  Khaimah  Investment  Authority, \nwhich now owns 100% of PSPC.   \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $18  million  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources  for  general  corporate  finance  purposes.  The  loan  will \nhave a term of up to 6 years. The interest rate, commitment fees, \nand  front-end  fee  will  be  determined  based  on  procedures \napplicable to ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations, and as approved by \nADB\u2019s investment committee. \n \n\n\f \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nJustification / ADB \nValue-Added \n\nThe modernization and improvement of the port consists of several \nsmall capital investments that will be undertaken under the current \nPSPC management, which has demonstrated a good track record. \n \nADB  should  consider  the  proposed  loan  for  the  port  of  Poti  for \nthe following reasons: \n\niii \n\n(i)  Georgia has recently suffered the double shocks of \nthe global financial crisis and war. ADB\u2019s proposed \nto  bringing  much  needed \nfinancing \nexternal funding into the country and increasing the \nconfidence of the international business community \nin Georgia. \n\nis  critical \n\n(ii)  Georgia  is  a  relatively  new  democracy  and  political \nrisk is therefore perceived to be relatively high. ADB\u2019s \npresence  will  mitigate  this  perceived  political  risk  for \nthe sponsor. \n\n(iii)  Development  of  the  transport  sector  is  the  key  to \nthe development and economic growth of Georgia. \nADB's  proposed  financing  will  play  an  important \nrole \nthat  has  been \nunderinvested to date.  \n\nin  developing  a  sector \n\n(iv)  The  Poti  seaport  is  a  key  infrastructure  link  in  the \ntransport corridor connecting Central Asia with the \nCaucasus \nbeyond. \nto  Europe \nStrengthening and augmenting this key nodal point \nwill  improve  connectivity  and  make  trade  more \nefficient in the region, leading to greater economic \ngrowth and regional integration.  \n\nand \n\nand \n\n(v)  The  proposed  loan  is  aligned  with  ADB's  interim \noperational  strategy  2008\u20132009  for  Georgia  and \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020. \n\n(vi)  The proposed loan will be ADB's first nonsovereign \nintervention  in  the  infrastructure  sector  in  Georgia \nand will further strengthen the relationship between \nADB and Georgia. \n\n \nNSO Rating \n\n \n \n9 \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Poti Sea Port Corporation.  \n \n\nA. \n\nSector Background \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Overview \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\n \n2. \nGeorgia is endowed with good natural resources, strong human capital, and is located at \na  strategic  crossroads  between  Europe  and  Asia.  The  Georgian  economy  has  benefited \ntremendously  from  structural  reforms,  macroeconomic  stabilization,  anticorruption  efforts, \ntaxation  changes,  and  economic  liberalization  measures  undertaken  since  early  2002.  These \nhave dramatically improved the business environment. In 2010, Georgia was 11th in the ease-\nof-doing-business ranking published by the World Bank.1   \n \n3. \nReal  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  grew  by  an  average  of  9.7%  during  2002\u20132006, \npeaking in 2007 at 12.2% (Table 1). In 2008, however, the underpinnings of economic growth \nand  stability  in  Georgia  were  severely  shaken  by  the  twin  shocks  of  war  with  the  Russian \nFederation  and  the  global  financial  crisis.  Before  these  shocks,  GDP  expansion  had  been \nprojected to be 8%\u20139% in both 2008 and 2009. The war damaged infrastructure and disrupted \nseveral sectors of the economy, including construction and transport, dampening overall growth. \nThe global economic downturn led to a decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) and a drying \nup of private international borrowing. The situation was aggravated by a decline in remittances, \na  slowdown  in  Georgia's  export  markets,  and  the  curtailing  of  lending  by  the  country\u2019s  banks. \nGDP growth dropped to 2.1% in 2008. \n \nAt the peak of its economic difficulties during the first half of 2009, the country\u2019s real \n4. \nGDP contracted by 7.8%. However, positive year-on-year growth during the third and fourth \nquarters of 2009 in such sectors as transport, construction, and financial intermediation, as well \nas a slight rebound in workers remittances and a modest yet encouraging increase in FDI, \nhelped limit the real GDP contraction for the year overall to 4.0% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2010.

Georgia  offers  the  shortest  direct  east\u2013west  link  between  Europe  and  the \ncountries  of  the  Caucasus  and  Central  Asia  and  also  connects  the  Russian  Federation  to  the \nnorth and Turkey and Iran, via Armenia, to its south.  \n \n7. \nGeorgia  provides  a  central  link  in  the  Transport  Corridor  Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia \n(TRACECA), 3    which  along  with  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC) \nprogram, seeks to revive the historical route of the Silk Road by building a modern land and sea \ntransport  corridor  connecting  the  three  regions  . 4  The  western  end  of  the  corridor  begins  in \nEastern Europe (Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine) before crossing Turkey and the Black Sea to \nthe port of Poti in Georgia. It uses the land transport network of the southern Caucasus to reach \nBaku in Azerbaijan, where it crosses the Caspian Sea via ferries (Baku\u2013Turkmenbashi, Baku\u2013\nAktau)  and  reaches  the  railway  networks  of  Central  Asian  states  of  Turkmenistan  and \nKazakhstan. The transport networks of these states are connected to destinations in the Kyrgyz \n\n                                                 \n2  International Monetary Fund. July 2010. Georgia: Sixth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement and Request for \n\nModification of Performance Criteria. Washington, DC. \n\n3    The  TRACECA  program  was  launched  in  Brussels  in  May  1993  to  implement  a  program  to  develop  a  transport \ncorridor  on  a  west\u2013east  axis  from  Europe  to  Central  Asia.  TRACECA  members  include  the  European  Union, \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Romania, Tajikistan, Turkey, \nTurkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. http://www.traceca-programme.eu/en/home/ \n\n4  The CAREC program is a partnership of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  six  multilateral  institutions:  ADB,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  United \nNations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \n\n\fRepublic,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan,  and  reach  the  borders  of  Afghanistan  and  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \n8. \nGeorgia is the transport hub for the southern Caucasus region, (comprising the countries \nof  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia)  and  a  key  link  in  a  route  connecting  the  landlocked \nCentral  Asian  countries  of  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan  and \nUzbekistan  to  important  markets  through  its  rail  and  road  system  and  Black  Sea  ports.  Its \nlocation  gives  Georgia  a  competitive  advantage  and  makes  transport one  of  its  most  dynamic \neconomic sectors. In 2009, the sector had an output of about GEL1.12 billion or 6% of Georgia\u2019s \nGDP, employed more than 39,000 people and moved 21.4 million tons of cargo.  \n \n9. \nGeorgia has about 1,500 kilometers (km) of roads in its main network, 70% of which are \nin good to fair condition. The east\u2013west highway through  Azerbaijan and Georgia is important \nfor cargo moving from the southern Caucasus and Central Asia to the Black Sea ports of Poti \nand  Batumi  and  to  the  Georgia\u2013Turkey  border  for  further  transshipment.  Georgian  Railways, \nwith 1,583 km of fully electrified railway network track, connects the country\u2019s main seaports to \nAzerbaijan and Armenia and is a key part of the east\u2013west transit corridor. Georgian Railways is \n100% government-owned and is the country\u2019s largest taxpayer and employer.  \n \n10. \nGeorgia\u2019s  ports,  in  conjunction  with  its  railroad  and  highway  systems,  oil  and  gas \npipelines  network  and  airports  constitute  the  vital  infrastructure  that  connects  origin  and \ndestination markets. The development of infrastructural capabilities in Georgia will play a critical \nrole in the establishment of a transregional transport, communication and energy corridor, which \nis  an  indispensable  precondition  for  the  economic  development  of  the  broader  Caucasus  and \nthe Central Asia region.  \n \n \n \nGeorgia has three main ports; Poti, Batumi, and Kulevi on its Black Sea coast. Georgia\u2019s \n11. \nBlack Sea ports handle the majority of cargos flowing from and to the three states of southern \nCaucasus. Georgia has privatized all its main ports which are now 100% foreign-owned. Total \ncargo handling by the Georgian ports reached 11.3 million tons in the first half of 2010, which is \n20.2% higher than for the same period of 2009 and 21.5% higher than first half of 2008.  \n \n12. \nBatumi, both an oil terminal and a general purpose seaport, is owned by KazTransOil, a \nsubsidiary of KazMunaiGaz, the national oil company of Kazakhstan. Crude oil and oil products \nmake up 80%\u201390% of its traffic. The port has an annual capacity of 18 million tons for oil and \n2.3 million tons for dry cargo. Kulevi is a new specialized oil port built in 2008 and is owned by \nSoccar, Azerbaijan\u2019s national oil company. It has a capacity of 10 million tons for oil and mainly \nstores and ships oil and oil products, principally from Azerbaijan.  \n \n13. \nThe port of Poti is Georgia's main port and has been in operation since 1858. Port of Poti \nis a multi functional port handling all kinds of cargos. It also plans to expand by building a new \ncontainer port in the near future which will increase its capacity. Poti lies on the shortest route \nbetween  Central  Asia,  the  Caucasus,  and  Europe  and  gives  that  region\u2019s  landlocked  nations\u2019 \naccess  to  the  Mediterranean  Sea  via  the  Bosporus.  It  has  significant  strategic  and  cost \nadvantages over its competition. More significantly the advantage of using Poti as a transit port \ndoes  not  depend  on  lower  port  charges  but  rather  on  its  more  efficient  rail,  land  and  sea \nlinkages. \n \n\nPorts in Georgia \n\n3. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n \nB. \n\nProject Identification and Selection \n\n14. \nThe Government of Georgia made development of Poti port a key priority and privatized \nit  in  April  2008  to  bring  in  greatly  needed  external  financial  investment  and  technical  and \nmanagerial  expertise.  The  international  competitive  bidding  process  attracted  interest  from \nmany  major  operators,  including  Dubai  Ports.  The  Ras  Al  Khaimah  Investment  Authority \n(RAKIA)  emerged  as  the  winning  bidder,  acquiring  an  initial  51%  ownership  of  the  port  and \nexpanding its stake to 100% in 2009. \n \n15.      ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department  and  Private  Sector  Operations  Department \nidentified  the  port  of  Poti  as  a  candidate  for  financing  and  held  meetings  with  RAKIA  in  late \n2008. The sponsor was interested in ADB participation because they wanted an institution they \nbelieved would help mitigate some of the political risks they perceived they faced in operating a \nrecently privatized asset in a volatile region. The sponsor also valued ADB\u2019s experience in the \ntransport sector and its growing presence in Georgia.  The sponsor is now implementing a port \nmodernization program for which they are seeking external funding from ADB. Liquidity for such \nfinancings within Georgia and in the international commercial markets is constrained.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 \n\n16. \nThe  financial  assistance  is  consistent  with  Strategy  2020,  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework,  which  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  support  for  infrastructure  projects,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and regional cooperation.5 An efficient port system is a key factor in improving a \ncountry\u2019s competitiveness and attracting investment.  \n   \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with the Country Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s country strategy for Georgia is now being prepared.6 The financial assistance is \n17. \naligned  with  ADB's  interim  operational  strategy  2008\u20132009  for  Georgia,  which  encourages \nprivate  sector  development,  investment  in  the  transport  sector,  and  improvement  of  regional \nconnectivity. 7  The  financial  assistance  is  also  strongly  aligned  with  the  central  theme  of  the \nGovernment of Georgia\u2019s development agenda, which is private-sector-led growth. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsistency with the Transport Sector Strategy \n\nThe  financial  assistance  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  sustainable  transport  initiative \n18. \noperations  plan,  which  encourages  private  sector  investment  in  the  transport  sector  and \ninvestment  in  cross-border  transport  hubs  that  promote  regional  economic  integration  by \nenabling growth in trade. 8\n\n \n                                                \n5  ADB.  2008.

The prime objective of RAKIA is the sustainable \neconomic  development  of  RAK  by  making  and  managing  sound  investments  in  RAK  and \ninternationally. RAKIA operates domestic and international business units involved in transport, \nfree trade zones, manufacturing, energy, education, and technology.  RAKIA is a professionally \nrun  organization  with  each  business  unit  acting  independently  and  is  managed  by  an \nexperienced  industry  specialist  who  is  responsible  for  the  performance  of  its  portfolio \ncompanies. \n \n20. \nThe mission of RAKIA\u2019s transport business is to build and operate nodal transport points \nin  emerging  markets.  Other  investments  of  this  kind  include  interests  in  an  airport  in  Georgia \nand  a  port  in  India.  In  Georgia,  RAKIA  has  made  investments  in  Poti\u2019s  port  and  the  first  free \nindustrial  zone  in  Georgia.  RAKIA  sees  attractive  business  opportunities  in  Georgia  and  is \ncommitted  to  further  investments.  RAKIA\u2019s  long-term  credit  rating  is  the  same  as  that  of  the \nemirate  of  Ras  Al  Khaimah  itself,  which  Fitch  reaffirmed  in  March  2010  at  A,  with  a  stable \noutlook. \n \n\n2. \n\nPort of Poti  \n\nThe port of Poti is the only true universal port in Georgia and handles both dry cargo and \n21. \ncontainer  traffic  to  and  from  several  countries  (Table  2).  The  cargo  passing  through  this \ninternational hub reflects the economies of the nations its serves along the TRACECA corridor \nand mainly consists of minerals and agricultural products. Appendix 5 describes in greater detail \nthe different cargoes passing through the port.  \n \n\n \n\n    Table 2: Origin and Destination of Cargo Traffic for Port of Poti \n\nCountries of Origin \nTurkey  \nUkraine  \nGeorgia  \nAzerbaijan  \nIndia  \nRussian Federation  \nGuinea  \nBulgaria  \nTajikistan  \nOthers  \n\nCountries of Destination \nAzerbaijan  \nGeorgia  \nArmenia  \nItaly  \nTajikistan  \nTurkey  \nUkraine  \nTurkmenistan  \nBulgaria  \nOther  \n\n    Source: Poti Sea Port Corporation.  \n\n \n \nThe 49-hectare port has operating wharves and storage facilities and is protected by a \n22. \nbreakwater. Road and railway connections are good and most of the cargo arrives or leaves by \nrail.  The  port  has  International  Standard  Quality  Management  System  Compliance  Certificate \nISO 9001:2000.9 Appendix 3 describes port infrastructure in detail.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  The  ISO  is  the  International  Organization  for  Standardization.  ISO  9001:2000  specifies  requirements  for  a  quality \n\nmanagement system for an organization. http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n23. \nPSPC  provides  (i)  cargo  handling  operations  (containers,  bulk,  general  cargo,  and \nliquids); (ii) port services (towing, sanitation services, ship tying, watchman\u2019s service, and water \nsupply  to  ships);  and  (iii)  repairs  and  ancillary  services  (crane  repair  and  installation,  intraport \ncarriage,  utility  services,  dockers  services,  etc.).  It  handles  dry  bulk  cargo  carriers,  container \ncarriers, lighter carriers, railway and motor ferries, liquid cargo carriers, tankers, and other types \nof  ships.  Cargo  includes  grains,  minerals,  construction  materials,  metals,  chemicals,  food \nproducts, diesel, kerosene and 20-foot and 40-foot containers.   \n \n24.   Current port customers are broadly divided into (i) forwarding companies (cargo handling \nand  warehousing);  (ii)  agency  companies  (port  and  other  service);  and  (iii)  lessees  (leasing, \nrepair  of  fixed  assets,  and  ancillary  services).  Major  international  forwarding  companies  and \nagencies  such  as  the  Maersk  Line,  Barwil  Georgia,  Pace  Georgia,  and  ZIM  account  for  the \nmajority of port business. \n \n\n3. \n\nCompetition \n\n25. \nOther Black Sea ports in Georgia, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine provide \nPoti  with  its  main  competition.  Appendix  4  describes  the  other  main  Black  Sea  ports. \nCompetitive advantage for ports often depends on location, access to principal trade routes, and \nthe  quality  of  their  hinterland  connections.  Poti  boasts  both  a  strategic  location  and  relatively \ngood rail and road transport links. \n \n26. \nPoti  seaport\u2019s  competitive  advantage  in  connecting  to  its  main  hinterland  markets  in \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia is substantial.  Ports in the Russian Federation and Ukraine \ndo not have direct or reliable road or rail connections. The Turkish Black Sea ports of Samsun \nand  Trabzon  might  compete  but  face  capacity  constraints  and  lack  good  rail  connections  with \nPoti\u2019s main market. Batumi is largely a liquids port, lacks suitable space for expansion, and has \npoorer,  higher-cost  rail  and  road  links  with  these  markets.  The  huge  infrastructure  investment \nrequired makes it unlikely that a new port will be built in Georgia any time soon. All the factors \nabove  and  the  fact  that  necessary  infrastructure  required  to  change  the  current  underlying \ncompetitive dynamics will take a long time to emerge limits the potential for serious competition \nfor Poti port\u2019s southern Caucasus traffic over the 6-year life of the ADB loan.  \n \n27. \nThe  route  from  Central  Asia  through  Poti  is  via  ferry  across  the  Caspian  Sea  to  Baku \nand  then  by  rail  to  the  port.  Poti  is  on  the  shortest  land-sea  route  between  Central  Asia  and \nWestern Europe. Central Asian traffic is expected to grow as infrastructure along the TRACECA \ncorridor improves.  \n \n28. \nPoti has tariff advantage in addition to the overall lower transport costs which customers \nin  Armenia,  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia  have  when  using  the  port  of  Poti  as  their  shipping  route. \nThe tariff levels indicate that PSPC may have room to increase its tariffs over time. \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nPort Development \n\n29. \nPoti seaport cargo is well diversified with a balanced mix of containers, bulk, and liquids. \nIt also has a fair mix of export and import traffic and is expected to grow from 2011 onwards with \nthe projected recovery of the economies of its hinterland areas in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia \nand of Central Asia. 10  \n\n \n                                                \n \n10 ADB. 2010. Asian Development Bank Outlook Update. 2010. Manila. Update forecasts GDP growth for Georgia at        \n\n4.5%, Armenia at 4% and Azerbaijan at 3.5% in 2011.      \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2010/Update/ado2010-update-statisticalappendix.pdf \n\n\f30. \nPoti has to capitalize on its natural competitive advantage and meet its full potential. The \ncurrent  port,  though  running  relatively  well  is  in  need  of  modernization  to  make  the  port  safer \nand  more  efficient.  PSPC  management  has  identified  a  comprehensive  infrastructure  and \nsystems  investment  strategy  for  the  development  of  the  port  to  meet  the  current  and  future \ndemand.  \n \n31. \nThe main components of the development strategy are (i) construction and rehabilitation \n(commissioning  of  berth  15,  rehabilitation  of  breakwater,  car  terminal,  new  road  and  rail \nconnectivity construction, etc.); (ii) purchase of modern equipment and machinery (cranes, tug \nboat,  fire  trucks,  etc.);  and  (iii)  upgrading  of  systems  (security,  terminal  operations,  vessels \ntraffic  management,  etc).  ADB  financing  will  partly  help  fund  this  development  strategy,  which \non successful implementation will lead to better port productivity, augmented capacity and safer \noperations. \n \n32.   PSPC\u2019s  strategic  vision  is  to  develop  Poti  into  a  world  class  port  and  enhance  the \ninternational  competitive  position  of  the  port  and  its  southern  Caucasus  hinterland.  RAKIA  is \nalso developing the Caucasus\u2019 first free trade zone next to the port, with which it should enjoy \nsignificant  synergies.  ADB  assistance  at  this  stage  is  only  for  the  development  of  the  existing \nport. RAKIA has indicated an interest in approaching ADB to help fund the port expansion.  \n \n\n5. \n\nOutput and Outcome \n\n33. \nThe output of the financial assistance will be to help modernize the operations of the port \nof Poti. The outcome of the financial assistance will be to increase the traffic volumes handled \nby the port of Poti.   \n \n \nB. \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n1. \n\nContribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n\n34. \nPorts are key facilitators of trade and economic growth. The port of Poti is the largest in \nGeorgia  and  the  main  access  point  to  the  Mediterranean  and  beyond  for  Azerbaijan  and \nArmenia. The port is also a central infrastructure link in the transport corridor connecting Central \nAsia  with  European  and  other  international  markets.  ADB's  proposed  financing  in  port  of  Poti \nwill  play  an  important  role  in  developing  one  of  the  key  nodal  points  for  the  region\u2019s  transport \ncorridor, which has suffered from a lack of investment. It will strengthen and augment the port\u2019s \nvital  contribution  to  connectivity  in  the  southern  Caucasus  region,  make  trade  more  efficient, \nand lead to greater economic growth.  \n \nA  better  functioning  port  is  an  economic  catalyst,  boosting  productivity  and  economic \n35. \ngrowth by providing faster and greater access to markets and resources, enhancing links within \nand  between  businesses,  and  increasing  trade  and  overall  economic  efficiency.  The  greater \neconomic  activity  resulting  from  increased  connectivity,  traffic,  and  commercial  activities  will \nhelp indirectly to reduce poverty in Georgia and the southern Caucasus region. \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nThe government of Georgia has privatized some infrastructure assets to bring in greatly \n36. \nneeded investment, technical knowledge, and private sector efficiency. The port of Poti  is seen \nas an early privatization success story and ADB assistance will reinforce this model. Given the \nport\u2019s  high  profile  in  the  Georgian  economy,  its  continued  successful  operation  and \ndevelopment is expected to encourage further privatization and foreign investment.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n37.  \nThe financial assistance\u2019s direct and indirect economic benefits will be significant, given \nthe  strong  positive  correlation  between  improved  port  transport  and  economic  growth.  The \neconomic benefits will primarily accrue to Georgia and to the port\u2019s hinterland areas in Armenia \nand Azerbaijan. Since the financial assistance involves the modernization of an existing port, it \nis  not  meaningful  to  segregate  the  incremental  economic  benefits  accruing  from  the  financial \nassistance  alone  with  precision.  For  such  cases,  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  12 \nrecommends using the annual economic rate of invested capital (EROIC) method in evaluating \neconomic  performance  rather  than  economic  internal  rate  of  return.  The  calculated  annual \neconomic rate of invested capital for the port of Poti ranges from 18% to 22% for 2010 to 2016, \nwhich is higher than the social discount rate of 10%.11  \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n38. \nThe  financial  assistance  involves  the  provision  of  a  loan  for  general  corporate  finance \npurposes.  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  requires  that  a  project  of  this  nature \nundergo a corporate audit of its current environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nand  formulate  a  corrective  action  plan  (CAP).  The  audit  reports  and  the  CAP  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendixes A, B, and C. Gamma, an independent consulting firm, prepared the \nenvironmental audit report on PSPC\u2019s existing operations. The audit found that PSPC operates \nin  compliance  with  national  Georgian  legislation  and  the  International  Convention  for  the \nPrevention of Pollution from Ships, and the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea from \nPollution.  It  also  confirmed  that  PSPC  has  the  capacity  and  dedicated  resources  required  for \nenvironmental management. The transaction has been classified as category B for environment \nfollowing the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n39. \nSince September 2009, the borrower has implemented a comprehensive ESMS that has \nappropriate  policies  and  procedures,  adequate  staffing  and  training,  as  well  as  a  grievance-\nredress mechanism to address both environmental and involuntary resettlement issues. PSPC \nhas  also  taken  measures  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  its  current  operations.  These \nincluded (i) construction of collector and treatment systems for industrial wastewater and storm \nwater, (ii) provision of personal protection equipment for personnel, and (iii) testing and safety \ntraining.  Currently air pollutant concentrations do not exceed limits, except for dust, especially \nduring unfavorable meteorological conditions. The spread of air pollutants is minimized through \npreventive  measures  under  the  ESMS.  Hazardous  waste  is  removed  by  licensed  contractors \nand  the  separation  of  wastes  is  implemented  properly  through  labeled  containers.  Biological \nimpacts  are  found  to  be  insignificant.  Positive  findings  include  the  port\u2019s  role  in  generating \nemployment of local people and in improving socioeconomic conditions in the city of Poti. \n \n40. \nA  time-bound  CAP  has  also  been  identified  that  incorporates  the  recommendations  of \nthe  audit  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  revised  ESMS.  It  includes  control  measures  to  cut  air \nemissions,  reduce  impacts  to  the  aquatic  environment,  decrease  the  risk  for  oil  product  and \nliquid chemical spills, and improve waste management practices. As of July 2010, the borrower \nhas  retained  professional  services  to  monitor  atmospheric  air  quality,  water  quality,  soil \ncontamination, and noise. The results will be reported regularly in the ESMS reporting system.  \nA  health,  safety,  security,  and  environmental  (HSSE)  division  includes  PSPC\u2019s  health  care, \necology,  safety  and  security,  watchmen,  and  firefighting  departments.  The  grievance-redress \n\n                                                \n \n11 The ECG\u2019s GPS-PSIO has set 10% as the threshold for satisfactory economic performance. \n\n\fmechanism has long been part of a community engagement program and has been formalized \nunder the HSSE division\u2019s general manager.   \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\nThe  port  of  Poti  was  constructed  in  1858  on  state-owned  land.  Expansions  and \n41.  \nrehabilitation took place in 1889, 1907, and the mid-20th century. The allocation of the port land \ncomplied with Georgian laws and involved no physical or economic displacement since the area \nwas  primarily  vacant  swamp.  The  ongoing  modernization  program  will  be  confined  to  the \nexisting  port  facility  and  will  not  require  any  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  No \ncommunities in the vicinity can be considered indigenous peoples, as defined in the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  The  central  control  tower  of  the  port  is  a  cultural  heritage  structure  and  is \nprotected by Georgian laws but will not be affected by the rehabilitation and modernization. \n  \n42. \nPSPC  complies  with  the  national  labor  code,  which  embodies  all  eight  International \nLabour  Organization  conventions  on  core  labor  standards,  equal  remuneration  for  men  and \nwomen  and  prohibition  of  all  forms  of  discrimination. 12   Measures  to  provide  better  working \nconditions, a safer environment for its employees, and to improve corporate governance at the \nport  are  being  implemented.  They  include  better  internal  labor  and  safety  policies  covering \nrecruitment,  compensation  and  benefits,  training,  and  development  programs.  PSPC  is  also \nestablishing  an  employee  relations  unit  to  address  and  resolve  employee  concerns  over  work \nconditions, compensation, and conflicts.  \n \n43. \nPSPC has an HSSE management system, which is implemented by the HSSE division. \nThe  division  also  handles  social  safeguard  issues  as  part  of  the  environmental  and  social \nimpact  assessment.  While  the  port  modernization  is  category  C  with  respect  to  involuntary \nresettlement,  PSPC  has  adopted  an  ESMS  that  includes  policy  principles  and  procedures \ncovering involuntary resettlement.   \n \nSince  new  management  took  over  in  2008,  PSPC  has  conducted  several  rounds  of \n44. \nconsultations  with  stakeholders  on  the  port  operations.  It  will  continue  to  engage  along  these \nlines of communication. PSPC has established good relationships with Poti\u2019s local government \nand  the  general  community.  The  ESMS  adopted  by  PSPC  includes  requirements  to  prepare \nresettlement  plans  in  the  event  that  the  port  activities  trigger  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2.  \n \nD. \n\nCapital Expenditure and Financing Plan \n\n45. \nPSPC  has  a  long-term  plan  to  implement  its  modernization  strategy  which  includes \nmaking  key  investments  over  time.    Construction  risk  will  be  low  because  the  civil  works \nelement  is  relatively  small.  Experienced  vendors  will  install  the  equipment  and  machinery. \nIndividual capital investments will be flexibly timed and spaced out to minimize disruption to port \noperations. The work will be tendered and be competitively priced. \n \nPSPC\u2019s current 3-year capital expenditure plan (2010\u20132012) is expected to be funded by \n46. \nloans  and  PSPC\u2019s  internally  generated  cash  or  equity.  The  debt  financing  for  this  capital \nexpenditure  plan  is  expected  to  come  from  the  proposed  ADB  loan  and  from  a  loan  from  the \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was closed in early 2010.  \n         \n\n                                                 \n12 The core labor standards are a set of internationally recognized basic rights and principles at  work.  Georgia has \n\nratified the International Labour Organization\u2019s fundamental conventions.  \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n \n47. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  a  general  corporate  finance  facility.  The  focus  of  the  corporate \nfinance facility is expected to help partly fund the company in the course of its planned capital \nexpenditure  to  modernize.  The  modernization  is  expected  to  include  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nbreakwater  which  will  be \nInternational  using  state-of-the-art \ntechnology. It is also expected to involve rehabilitation of berth 15 for handling bulk cement and \ngrain; and the purchase of equipment which will improve safety and raise port productivity.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nimplemented  by  Boskalis \n\n1. \n\nManagement  \n\n \n48. \nThe sponsor has brought in an experienced chief executive officer and key managers to \nexecute its strategy for change and growth while the rest of the port continues to be run by the \nsame pre-privatization employees who have operated it for many years.  \n \n49. \nPSPC  will  implement  the  port  modernization  strategy.  Given  limited  availability  in \nGeorgia, most highly specialized equipment will likely be imported from abroad. Civil works will \nbe  largely  done  by  local  contractors.    The  new  management  has  already  demonstrated  a \npositive  impact  on  the  ground  by  improving  port  operations  and  rehabilitating  berth  14  in  less \nthan  a  year.  PSPC  also  managed  a  net  profit  in  2009  despite  a  very  challenging \nmacroeconomic environment.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n50. \nThe sponsor and borrower have been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  and  its  Policy  on  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB will require PSPC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures \nand  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing \ncorruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and PSPC will \nfurther  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings. \nNoncompliance by the borrower with any of the undertakings and covenants mentioned above \nwill allow ADB to seek immediate prepayment of the ADB loan.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n\nPSPC  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements  and  annual \n51. \nfinancial  statements  audited  by  an  internationally  reputable  accounting  firm  (or  its  affiliate), \nbased on International Financial Reporting Standards. ADB will monitor progress with respect to \nPSPC\u2019s  updated  business  plans  and  operational  budgets,  and  report  on  progress  and  make \noccasional  site  visits  to  the  port.  Appendix  1  contains  the  design  and  monitoring  framework, \nincluding the relevant performance indicators. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Operational and Financial Performance \n\n52. \nThe  financial  projections  show  that  PSPC  generates  adequate  cash  flows  to  service \nADB  debt  under  base  case  and  downside  scenarios.  PSPC\u2019s  projections  have  a  15-year  time \nhorizon but ADB analysis has focused on the proposed 6-year life of the loan, which is expected \nto  mature  in  2016.  The  base  case  assumes  that  port  traffic  will  grow  as  economic  growth \nrecovers in the Caucasus and Central Asian region (footnote 10). This is line with the historical \ngrowth rate of PSPC over the last 10 years.   \n \n\n\f11 \n\n53. \nPSPC generates the bulk of its revenues directly from port traffic with additional income \nfrom  leased  berths  to  third  parties  under  long-term  contracts.  Current  tariffs  are  assumed  to \nescalate  at  rates  that  are  lower  than  the  2003\u20132009  average  inflation  rates  in  Georgia  of \n7.57%13 and the 6.0% inflation forecast for 2010 and 2011.14   \n \nIn the base case, PSPC is expected to generate strong cash flows that will enable it to \n54. \nservice its debts during the term of the loan. Projected financials also indicate healthy efficiency. \nThe  base  case  return  on  invested  capital,  the  ROIC  is  projected  at  a  range  higher  than  the \nweighted average cost of capital of PSPC.  \n \n \n55. \nAn independent traffic study at the port was conducted for ADB by KPMG, London and \nJacobs  Consultancy,  London.  Their  findings  were  in  line  with  PSPC  projections.  The  financial \nprojections were subjected to sensitivity tests to see how the loan would perform under several \nscenarios.  The  sensitivity  tests  show  that  financial  assistance  to  PSPC  is  bankable  and  can \nmaintain satisfactory debt service capacity even under adverse scenarios.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n1. \n\nInstrument and Amount \n\n56. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  consist  of  a  corporate  finance  loan  of  up  to  $18 \nmillion.  The  loan  will  be  funded  using  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  without  government \nguarantee.   \n \n\n2. \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n57. \nThe loan will have a tenor of 6 years and the loan will carry an interest rate as well as \ncommitment  and  front-end  fees  to  be  determined  by  ADB\u2019s  investment  committee.  The  loan \nagreement  will  set  out  the  appropriate  representations  and  warranties,  covenants  (including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and informational), events of default and security (validly created \nand perfected in a manner satisfactory to ADB). The loan agreement will also contain conditions \nprecedent to disbursement, including all necessary government and shareholder consents and \napprovals and compliance with ADB policy and safeguard standards. \n \n\n3. \n\nCompliance with Investment Limitations  \n\n58. \nThe transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected nonsovereign \nexposure  by  end  of  June  2011  to  $5.8  billion.    Additionally,  the  proposed  transaction  will \nincrease the nonsovereign exposure to Georgia to $33 million, or 0.6% of the total nonsovereign \nexposure, and increase nonsovereign exposure in the ports, waterways, and shipping subsector \nto  $18  million,  or  0.3%  of  the  total  nonsovereign  exposure.  The  proposed  financing  is  within \nADB's  approved  medium-term,  country,  industry,  single  obligor,  and  group  exposure  limits  for \nnonsovereign  transactions.  Indicatively,  the  transaction  would  increase  the  nonsovereign \nportfolio weighted average risk rating as at 30 June 2010 from 7.40 to 7.43. \n \nB. \n\nJustification for ADB Assistance \n\nThe proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n\n59. \n                                                 \n13 CIA World Factbook. 2010. http://www.indexmundi.com/georgia/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html \n14 ADB. 2010. Asian Development Bank Outlook Update 2010. Manila. \n\nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2010/Update/ado2010-update-statisticalappendix.pdf \n\n \n\n\f12 \n \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nGeorgia  has  suffered  a  double  shock  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  war.  \nThis  has  resulted  in  a  lack  of  funding  for  Georgian  projects  from  international \nfinancial markets. ADB\u2019s proposed financing not only provides critically important \nshort-term  funding  but  is  also  expected  to  help  increase  confidence  in  the \ninternational business community about investment in Georgia. \nGeorgia is a relatively new democracy and political risk is therefore perceived to \nbe  relatively  high.  ADB,  being  a  multilateral  bank  with  strong  and  growing \nrelationship  with  Georgia  is  seen  as  being  well  placed  to  help  mitigate  this \nperceived political risk for the sponsor. \nThe port will provide long-term employment opportunities for the people of Poti, \nwhere  few  such  opportunities  now  exist.  PSPC  is  recognized  as  a  good \ncorporate citizen and is committed to investing for the long term future of the port \nand the people of Poti. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  be  ADB's  first  nonsovereign  intervention  in  the \ninfrastructure sector in Georgia. It will further strengthen the relationship of ADB \nwith one of its newest developing member countries. This loan will also be ADB\u2019s \nfirst private sector intervention in the port sector after 11 years.  \nThe  development  of  the  transport  sector  is  key  to  the  long-term  economic \ndevelopment  in  Georgia,  which  seeks  to  capitalize  on  its  natural  role  as  transit \ncountry  located  at  a  crossroads  of  the  Caucasus,  Central  Asia,  and  Europe. \nADB's  proposed  investment  in  Poti  port,  which  is  an  important  nodal  point,  will \nhelp develop a crucial sector that has suffered from a lack of investment.  \nThe port is a key infrastructure link in the transport corridor joining Central Asia \nand Europe through the Caucasus. Strengthening and augmenting it will improve \nregional  connectivity  and  cooperation,  make  trade  more  efficient,  and  generate \neconomic  growth.  It  will  also  complement  work  being  done  by  ADB  in \nstrengthening the Central Asian section of the same transport corridor.15 \nThe proposed financial assistance is aligned with the emphasis in Strategy 2020 \n(footnote  5)  on  infrastructure  development,  private  sector  development,  and \nregional  integration.  It  is  also  strongly  aligned  with  the  central  theme  of  the \ndevelopment  agenda  of  the  Government  of  Georgia,  which  is  private  sector-led \ngrowth.  It  also  conforms  to  ADB's  interim  operational  strategy  2008\u20132009  for \nGeorgia,  which  encourages  private  sector  development,  investment  in  the \ntransport sector, and improvements to regional connectivity.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nC. \n\n60. \nThe financial assistance has been assigned a risk rating for nonsovereign operations of \nNSO 9. Given that ADB currently has very little nonsovereign exposure in Georgia and none in \nthe  port  subsector,  the  project  will  improve  the  country  and  sector  diversification  of  ADB's \nnonsovereign portfolio.16 The key risks and mitigating measures are summarized below. \n \n\n(i) \n\nSponsor  and  management  risk.  The  capability  of \nthe  sponsor  and \nmanagement of PSPC will be an important factor in determining the results of the \n\n                                                \n \n15  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Administration of Loan to Republic of Kazakhstan: CAREC Transport Corridor. Manila; ADB. \n2010. Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the CAREC Transport Corridor 2. \nManila. \n\n16  ADB  made  an  equity  investment  of  $7.4  million  and  a  loan  of  $36.1  million  in  Colombo  Port,  which  was  very \nsuccessful.  The  loan  has  been  repaid  and  ADB  exited  the  equity  with  a  profit.  ADB.  1999  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and  Equity  Investment  for  the \nColombo Port Development Project. Manila. \n\n\f13 \n\nport  modernization  effort.  The  sponsor,  RAKIA  is  highly  rated  A  by  Fitch  and \nPSPC  has  brought  in  experienced  management  from  outside.  This  has  already \nshown positive results on the ground. The port is still largely staffed by seasoned \npre-privatization  employees  who  have  been  running  it  successfully  for  many \nyears.  PSPC  managed  to  rehabilitate  berth  14  successfully  in  less  than  a  year \nand  to  maintain  profitability  in  2009  despite  a  very  tough  macroeconomic \nenvironment.   \n\nCompetitive  environment.    The  strong  competitive  position  of  the  port, \nparticularly  during  the  loan  term,  and  its  competitive  tariff  structure  partly \nmitigates  the  market  risk  related  to  traffic,  tariff,  and  competition.  Port  of  Poti  is \nseen as having significant competitive advantage in its main hinterland market of \nArmenia,  Azerbaijan,  and  Georgia  because  of  its  superior  geographic  location \nand  better  transport  linkages.  However,  the  emergence  of  stronger  competition \nagainst Poti in the future cannot be fully discounted. \n\nMarket  risk.    The  traffic  of  Poti  is  expected  to  grow  as  the  economy  of  its \nhinterland is forecasted to grow and the new management of PSPC implements \na more business friendly commercial strategy. The traffic projections have been \nvalidated  by  an  independent  traffic  study  and  the  ADB  loan  is  expected  to  be \nserviced  even  under  adverse  traffic  scenarios.  The  Poti  tariffs\u2019  projected \nincreases are conservatively assumed to be below projected inflation rates.  \n\n \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nForeign exchange risk. The port revenues and costs are denominated in dollars \nfor the most part, the same currency as the ADB loan. This risk is not considered \nsignificant. \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n61. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  Georgia  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nassistance  to  PSPC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such  confirmation.  ADB \nwill  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n62. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  a  loan  of  up  to \n$18,000,000  to  the  Poti  Sea  Port  Corporation  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,    with \ninterest  to  be  determined  based  on  the  procedures  applicable  to  ADB's  nonsovereign \noperations, a tenor of up to 6 years, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n\n15 November 2010 \n\n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact \nIncrease in economic \nintegration of Georgia \nwith the Caucasus and
