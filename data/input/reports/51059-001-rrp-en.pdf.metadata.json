The program will introduce rules-based fiscal \nplanning in the government\u2019s budget system, improve legal and institutional structures governing \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  and  help  improve  the  business  environment  and  access  to \nfinance  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  The  programmatic  approach  will \ncomprise  two  subprograms  implemented  during  2017\u20132018.  Approved  transaction  technical \nassistance is assisting with the implementation of the program.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic  context.  After  gaining  independence  in  1991,  Azerbaijan  registered  rapid \n3. \neconomic  growth  averaging  11.0%  during  1995\u20132013.  The  growth  was  largely  fueled  by \nhydrocarbon activity, which contributed to 90% of the country\u2019s exports and around 75% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and government income. The crash in the global oil prices from a high \nof $110 per barrel in 2014 to $50 in 2015 caused a major setback to the economy leading to a \nsignificant fall in revenues contracting public investments and tightening domestic demand. As a \nresult, the fiscal balance of the central government budget shifted from a surplus of 2.9% of GDP \nin  2014  to  a  deficit  of  4.8%  in  2015.  In  2016  the  central  government  budget  was  balanced; \nhowever,  without  transfers  from  State  Oil  Fund  of  Azerbaijan  (SOFAZ),  the  budget  deficit \namounted to 13.4% of GDP.2 Decline in oil export revenues also led to a negative current account \nbalance.  With  this  backdrop  of  falling  oil  prices,  the  Central  Bank  of  Azerbaijan  devalued  the \nmanat  twice  in  2015.  On  12  October  2017,  the  value  of  the  manat  in  United  States  dollars \nrepresented only 46% of its 2014 year-end value. Since the government has a high proportion of \ndebt  denominated  in foreign  currency,  the  devaluation  deteriorated the  country\u2019s  external  debt \nposition, exacerbating inflationary pressures because of a high exchange rate pass-through effect \nand  also  created  a  shortage  of  credit  to  the  private  sector,  especially  in  local  currency.  The \naverage inflation rate rose from 4.0% in 2015 to 12.4% in 2016. These factors culminated in a \nnegative growth rate of the economy of \u20133.1% in 2016 compared to 2.8% in 2014.  \n \n4. \nDevelopment problem. The twin development of economic growth and social indicators \nhas been a key feature of the Azerbaijan growth story since the 2000s. However, the traditional \nheavy  dependence  of  the  economy  on  hydrocarbons  exposed  the  country  to  macroeconomic \nshocks while limiting the development of the non-oil sector. Excessive reliance on hydrocarbons \ncontributed to appreciation of the real exchange rate of the manat during the oil boom era, thereby \nundercutting the international competitiveness of the nonresource sector and negatively affecting \nthe export of nonresource goods. This is the core development problem in Azerbaijan, manifested \n                                                \n1   The program is included in ADB. 2017.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Countercyclical \nSupport Facility Program. Manila (TA 9259-AZE). This technical assistance is supporting the implementation of the \nprogram.  \n\n2   Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.  \n\n\f2 \n\nthree-dimensionally  along  fiscal  management,  public  sector  management,  and  nondiversified \neconomic  development  paradigms.  Supported  by  stakeholder  consultations  and  diagnostic \nstudies, the core issues faced by Azerbaijan are distilled in paras 5-9. \n \nChallenges in fiscal  and  public  debt  management.  On the  fiscal  side,  Azerbaijan  is \n5. \nexperiencing  a  procyclical  budget\u2014a  characteristic  of  a  resource-rich  country.  Until  2014,  the \ngovernment  expenditure  increased  significantly;  however,  the  decline  in  oil  revenue  was  not \nfollowed by a commensurate reduction in expenditure, leading to a large fiscal deficit after 2014. \nThe  current  government  budgetary  procedures  need  to  be  streamlined  to  prevent  ad  hoc \nspending decisions that result in inefficient allocation of resources not linked to sector priorities \nand  lack  focus  on  long-term,  non-oil  sustainability.  The  fiscal  policy  framework  lacks  a  clearly \nelaborated and well-established rule to guide the use of oil revenues to finance public spending.3 \nThe  current  system  is  closely  linked  to  oil  prices  and  is  deficient  on  long-term  measures  on \nreducing  the  dependence  on  oil.  A  significant  burden  adding  to  the  state  budget  outlays  is \nfinancing the pension fund deficit through transfers from the state budget. The transfers to the \nState Social Protection Fund amounted to $781 million in 2016, down from $1.07 billion in 2015. \nThis,  coupled  with increased  debt  servicing  obligations  on foreign-currency-denominated  debt, \nhas contracted the available fiscal space. Some key reforms are needed to reduce the burden of \nsocial expenditure (such as pensions) and debt servicing on the state budget. These reforms will \nhelp  increase  the  available  fiscal  space  and  reprioritize  expenditure  allocations  to  productive \nsectors. \n \n6. \nBecause of manat depreciation and increase in the fiscal deficit stemming from the fall in \noil revenues and absence of fiscal consolidation, the stock of public debt has grown substantially. \nThe  nominal  gross  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  increased  from  11%  in  2014  to  28%  in  2015  and \nfurther  to  38%  in  2016.  Since  over  70%  of  Azerbaijan's  public  debt  is  denominated  in  foreign \ncurrencies, debt sustainability needs to be closely monitored. Future borrowings, exchange rate \nvolatility, and debt of SOEs may put added pressure on debt ratios. The public debt management \nsystem  in  Azerbaijan  lacks  a  medium-term  strategic  framework  or  a  standardized  information \ntechnology  platform  for  recording  debt  transactions.  This  leads  to  challenges  such  as  lack  of \ncoordination  between  the  cash  management  system  and  debt  management  system  of  the \ngovernment, manual collection and reporting of debt indicators, and inadequate dissemination of \ninformation on debt, giving rise to issues of transparency and data integrity.  \n \n7. \nChallenges  in  the  business  environment.  Challenges  in  the  business  environment \ninclude  lack  of  economic  diversification,  inadequate  development  of  the  private  sector, \ninefficiencies  in  SOEs,  decline  in  banking  system  solvency,  and  limited  access  to  finance  for \nbusinesses. A primary way to reduce dependency on oil revenues is to diversify the economy, \nwhich in turn hinges upon development of a vibrant, non-oil private sector. The economic activities \nare being primarily led by the public sector with very limited role for the private sector. Though \nAzerbaijan was a leader in terms of growth up until 2014 among the Caucasus and Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation countries, it lags behind most countries in the region in terms of \nease of doing business. Azerbaijan was ranked 65th among 190 countries in 2017 and is one of \nthe lowest ranked countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States.4 Access to finance has \nbeen one of the major factors leading to constrained growth of the private sector, especially for \nSMEs. Data from the 2017\u20132018 Global Competitive Index ranks Azerbaijan low in terms of ease \n\n                                                \n3   A fiscal rule is a framework comprising macroeconomic and budget parameters for implementation of budget policy \n\nwhich ensures medium- and long-term macroeconomic stability and financial and debt disciplines. \n\n4   World Bank. 2017. Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All. Economy Profile 2017: Azerbaijan. Washington, \n\nDC. \n\n \n\n\fof  access  to  finance  among  the  major  regional  countries.5 The  promotion  of  SMEs  is  a  major \ncomponent  of  private  sector  development.  However,  the  sector  has  not  seen  much  growth \nbecause  of  a  variety  of  issues  such  as  regulatory  bottlenecks,  an  unfriendly  tax  environment, \nnonavailability of affordable finance, a weak entrepreneur base, and limited access to finance.6 \nThis in turn has also inhibited the growth of non-oil exports. As a measure to improve access to \nfinance for enterprises, the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support (NFES) was constituted \nunder  the  Ministry  of  Economy.  Authorized  lending  institutions,  including  banks  and  nonbank \nfinancial institutions, can issue loans on preferential terms according to the criteria framed by the \nsupervisory board of the NFES for financing investment projects that are in the priority areas for \nsocioeconomic  development  of  Azerbaijan.  However,  the  recent  economic  recession  has \nadversely affected the performance of the fund, resulting in a decline in the number of enterprises \nthat are supported by the fund and consequently reducing the employment generated.  \n \n8. \nA significant portion of the economic activities within the country is generated by 14 largest \nSOEs playing a key role in all important sectors of the economy. The SOEs are active in the oil \nand gas, power generation, water supply, railway, air passenger, and cargo areas. For example, \nState Oil Company of Azerbaijan, along with consortium of international oil companies is engaged \nin hydrocarbon extraction that contributes 50% of the country\u2019s GDP and over 90% of its exports. \nMany SOEs, however, receive budget subsidies and are saddled with inefficiencies, and many \nare incurring losses. They face binding issues relating to ownership, management, transparency, \naccountability,  financial  sustainability,  and  societal  value  creation.  Corporate  governance  is \nanother area of concern which has affected the performance and image of SOEs in Azerbaijan. \nAlthough the presidential decree of October 2016 recommends improving the efficiency of SOEs, \na well-designed corporate governance rules framework is yet to be put in place. \n \n9. \nThe banking system came under severe stress in the aftermath of the economic downturn \nin Azerbaijan as 11 banks lost their license in 2016. This led to a loss of public confidence in the \nbanking subsector. The share of deposits in domestic currency in the total deposits of the banks \nsharply declined from 50.1% in 2014 to 24.7% in 2016.7 The Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund \n(ADIF)  was  established  to  insure  people\u2019s  deposits  and  maintain  confidence  in  the  banking \nsystem. The ADIF disbursed $90 million in 2015 and $348 million in 2016 as compensation to \ndepositors for failing banks. However, such heavy disbursements have depleted the asset base \nof  the  ADIF,  and  this  needs  to  be  replenished  for  the  fund  to  continue  providing  depositor \ncompensation. Considering that the ADIF is already under severe financial strain, it is important \nthat  the  premiums  are  priced  properly.  The  2017  amendments  to  the  Law  of  the  Republic  of \nAzerbaijan on Banks clarify the role of the ADIF in liquidation of banks. However, there is a need \nto institute risk-based pricing of deposit insurance premiums for banks and build in safeguards for \nmoral hazards. As mentioned earlier, access to finance is one of the key inhibiting factors limiting \nthe growth of the private business sector in Azerbaijan. Suitable credit enhancement instruments \nfor providing financial assistance to businesses can improve availability of finance for the private \nsector.  The  weakening of  the  banking  subsector  because  of  high  dollarization  of  deposits  has \nalso led to limited availability of credit to the private sector.   \n \n10. \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. To ensure sustainable growth, the government is looking \nat ways to diversify the economy while consolidating budgetary expenditure and boosting non-oil \n\n                                                \n5   World  Economic  Forum.  2017.

The  priority  structural  reforms  contained  in  the  Strategic  Roadmap  of  National \nEconomy  include  strengthening  public  institutions,  facilitating  access  to  finance,  and  efficient \npublic  financial  management.8 The  series  of  reform  initiatives  include fiscal  measures  such  as \nenforcing a stricter fiscal rule on the use of oil revenues and the development of medium-term \nexpenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs)  for  key  spending  ministries.  The  rule  will  help  to  ensure \nintergenerational  equity,  reduce  procyclicality,  and  achieve  fiscal  consolidation  given  shrinking \nfiscal space. The government has also embarked on structural reforms addressing the financial \nmanagement  issues  and  institutional  inefficiencies  in  SOEs.  It  has  also  instituted  measures  to \nstreamline  the  existing  processes  for  improving  indicators  on  the  ease  of  doing  business.  To \nstrengthen the banking subsector, the government is increasing the capital base of the ADIF and \nremoving  bottlenecks  for  resolution  of  insolvent  banks.  The  government  is  setting  up  a  credit \nguarantee  fund  to  ease  the  access  to  credit  by  SMEs  with  reduced  collateral.  The  proposed \nprogram will bolster private non-oil economic activity, increase fiscal space, and help Azerbaijan\u2019s \ntransition to a diversified economy.9   \n \n11. \nProgrammatic  approach.  The  structural  reforms  require  a  long-term  time  horizon  to \nimplement and attain the intended outcomes effectively. For example, introduction of an MTEF \nrequires  sufficient  preparatory  and  implementation  time.  A  programmatic  approach  facilitates \nchronological sequencing of reforms across a multiyear time horizon through explicit framing of \nrequired  policy  actions  and  objectives.  The  proposed  modality  also  plays  a  leveraging  and \ncatalyzing role in coordinating technical assistance provided by development partners. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  coordinating  closely  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  in \nidentifying and sequencing the policy actions.     \n \nin  Azerbaijan  have \n12. \ninvestment projects mainly in transport, energy, water supply, and the finance sector. The World \nBank  supports  strengthening  the  business  environment,  and  facilitates  agriculture  lending \ncapacity.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  is  supporting  the  private \nsector through equity investments in financial institutions, direct lending, financial intermediation, \nand capacity building in business administration. Funded by the Swiss Cooperation Agency, the \nInternational Finance Corporation also supports financial institutions via investments and advisory \nservices.  The  European  Union  provides  technical  advice  in  the  areas  of  public  financial \nmanagement and governance. The World Bank will also provide technical assistance on some \npublic financial management areas in 2018. The International Monetary Fund provides technical \nsupport on development of new fiscal rules and advises government on macroeconomic policy \nand the exchange rate regime. Under this program, the ADB is complementing implementation of \na fiscal rule being developed by the International Monetary Fund and is consolidating the medium-\nterm horizon of budget planning conceptualized by the World Bank.  \n \n13. \nLessons. The program takes into account lessons from ADB\u2019s programmatic engagement \nin many other developing member countries in the areas of public financial management, financial \nsector development, and SOE reforms, and lessons from the recent and specific policy dialogue \nin the Azerbaijan context. The policy dialogue has highlighted the importance of supporting the \nplanned or initiated reform processes with technical assistance, which is instrumental in building \na strong base for the reforms to move to the next level. Policy reforms must be accompanied by \nstrong government ownership, which is demonstrated by the government\u2019s clear reform priorities \nand  willingness  to  engage  in  a  multiyear  programmatic  engagement  framework  with  ADB.  In \n\nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Development  partners \n\n                                                \n8  Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on approval of the Roadmap on National Economy and Main \n\nSectors of the Economy dated 9 December 2016. \n\n9  ADB. 2014.

Manila \n\n\finternational \n\nimplementing \n\nimprovements \n\nin  SOEs,  and \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\naddition,  setting  realistic  policy  actions  is  critical  to  ensuring  that  the  reform  program  can  be \ncarried  out  effectively  while  building  simultaneous  capacities.  International  lessons  for  the \nsuccessful  development  of  public  financial  management,  financially  sustainable  SOEs,  and \nfinance sector development emphasize several crucial factors: (i) sound sequencing and realism \nin reform objectives; (ii) clear connection to local circumstances; and (iii) sound, modern, reliable, \nand efficient institutional infrastructure. The program incorporates these lessons.  \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value addition. In 2016, ADB provided a short-term countercyclical support facility \nto  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  the  economic  recession.  As  highlighted  in  the  facility\u2019s \ndevelopment  policy  letter,  the  government  also  sought  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  support  structural \nreforms in the medium term related to macroeconomic and fiscal management, improving public \nsector  efficiency  and  accountability,  and  promoting  SME  development.10 ADB  adds  significant \nvalue to the programmatic approach by (i) identifying critical policy actions based on preparatory \nworks carried out during the preparation of the facility; (ii) improving the targeting of reform-related \nexpenditures and their partial financing; (iii) enhancing coordination with development partners in \nthe  design and  execution  of the  programmatic  approach;  (iv)  providing technical  assistance to \nsustain the reform initiatives, especially in the areas related to rule-based budgeting, corporate \ngovernance \nfinancial  reporting \nstandards;11 and (v) consolidating policy reforms in the finance sector. ADB also gives a strong \nimpetus to  the government\u2019s  ongoing debt  management  reforms  by  providing affordable  least-\ncost solutions critical to sustaining these reform initiatives. \n \nB. \n \nThe program impact will be sustainable and broad-based economic growth facilitated. The \n15. \noutcome will be allocative efficiency of public and private resources improved. Subprogram 1 has \n17 policy actions and subprogram 2 has 22 policy actions.  All subprogram 1 policy actions have \nbeen completed. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nOutput  1:  Rule-based  fiscal  planning  introduced.  The  objective  of  this  output  is  to \npromote discipline in fiscal policy making over the medium-term horizon to put Azerbaijan on a \npath of fiscal consolidation. This will be achieved by improving multiyear budget formulation and \nforecasting,  increasing  fiscal  space  by  rationalizing  public  expenditures,  and  improving \nmanagement  of  public  debt  and  fiscal  risks.  Anchoring  consolidation  in  credible  multiyear \nframeworks  is  instrumental  to  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  ultimately  achieving \nsustainable and inclusive growth. Under the program, the government has formulated fiscal rules \nto serve as the basis of the national budget formulation. An important advantage of a rule-based \nfiscal  framework  is  greater  focus  on  medium-term  budgetary  forecasts,  which  in  turn  ensures \nbetter targeting of sector priorities. The government has initiated preparation of an MTEF on a \npilot  basis  for  one  large-spending  ministry,  which  will  then  be  scaled  up.  The  MTEFs  play  an \nimportant role in improving budget and expenditure management processes for better utilization \nand prioritization of existing fiscal resources in line with government priorities.

Manila. \n\n11 While this program promotes corporate and financial governance standards across SOEs of different sectors, the \nproposed  Railways  Sector  Development  Program  represents  a  sector  focused  package  of  sector,  financial, \ngovernance, tariff and corporate reforms in railways. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f \n17. \nSeveral  laws  have  been  amended  under  subprogram  1  to  improve  public  financial \nmanagement. The amended law on labor pensions will reduce the quantum of deficit financing \nrequired for meeting pension fund liabilities, as the government currently allocates a significant \namount from the state budget to meet the deficit in the pension fund every year. This in turn will \ncreate the fiscal room to prioritize the expenditure allocations to productive sectors. Other legal \nand policy interventions have been undertaken with the aim of streamlining and restructuring (i) \nmanagement  of  the  State  Guarantee  Fund,  (ii)  borrowings  by  SOEs,  and  (iii)  management  of \nsingle  treasury  account  residual  funds.  Subprogram  1  has  also  prepared  a  medium-term  debt \nmanagement  strategy  including  an  information-technology-based  debt  management  system  to \nmanage  debt  at  a  sustainable  level.  This  will  provide  a  key  element  of  a  rule-based  fiscal \nframework by having ceilings on fiscal deficit, debt, and the interest service obligations on debts. \nTo  implement  the  debt  management  strategy,  the  government  will  undertake  institutional \nreorganization of the Public Debt Management Agency and has deliberated on the design of a \ndebt management system for improving recording and dissemination of information on debt, and \nfinalized the same.   \n \n18. \nOutput 2. State-owned enterprises restructured and private sector participation in \neconomic  activities  strengthened.  Financially  sustainable  and  effective  SOEs  are  critical \nprerequisites  for  improved  public  service  delivery  and  reduced  fiscal  transfers  from  the \ngovernment  budget.  The  actions  under  this  output  aim  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  of \nSOEs, standardize financial practices, and allow space for private sector participation in economic \nactivities.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  formulated  an  action  plan  to  improve  the \ntransparency and financial reporting practices of SOEs. The action plan outlines the activities to \nbe undertaken and underpins the role of various agencies responsible for implementing the action \nplan, along with specific time frames required for undertaking each activity. A commission has \nalso  been  constituted  which  will  closely  monitor  and  report  to  the  government  the  financial \nperformance of the SOEs, especially in the areas of financial planning and utilization of funds. To \nensure  greater  adherence  to  international  practices  in  the  functioning  of  the  SOEs,  the \ngovernment has drafted comprehensive corporate governance rules that will guide the selection \nof  directors,  internal  audit,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  procedures  for  all  SOEs. \nAdditionally, the government is amending the existing accounting laws to strengthen accounting \npractices in SOEs by mandating implementation of international financial reporting standards. To \ndiversify  the  economy  of  Azerbaijan  and  reduce  the  dependence  on  oil,  the  government  has \nformulated and approved strategic  plans for the national economy and the key sectors. These \nplans articulate the key goals and actions to achieve those goals over short-, medium-, and long-\nterm horizons. The policy actions under subprogram 1 also facilitate formulation of guidelines for \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  to  improve  transparency  and  address  limitations  of  public  financial \nresources in strengthening economic activities and creating new jobs. \n \nOutput  3.  Enhanced  access  to  finance  and  business  environment  improved.  The \n19. \ninterventions under this output aim to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on oil exports \nthrough enhanced participation of the private sector in economic activities by increasing access \nto finance and improving the business environment for the private sector. Improving access to \nfinance, especially for SMEs in local currency, is the key to achieving the broader objective of \ndiversification  of  the  economy.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  has  prepared  a  detailed \naction plan highlighting key intervention areas for improving the overall business environment in \nthe country. Based on the action plan, as a credit enhancement measure the government has set \nup a credit guarantee fund for SMEs  with measures to manage risks related to moral hazards \ngenerally  associated  with  the  operation  of  credit  guarantee  funds  (e.g.,  setting  up  a  seven- \nmember  supervisory  board  with  nongovernment  participation  and  working  groups  made  up  of \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\neminent persons from the public and private sectors). Credit bureaus play a vital role in reducing \nthe risk in the financial sector by maintaining a repository of borrowers and their risk profiles based \non  their  credit  history.  Under the  program the government  has  passed  the enabling  legislation \nthat  will  help  to  establish  the  legal  framework  for  setting  up  a  credit  bureau  and  defining  its \nactivities.  \n \n20. \nBased on the action plan to improve the ranking in the ease of doing business indicators, \nthe  government  is  implementing  reforms  based  on  the  World  Bank\u2019s  ease  of  doing  business \nparameters. Because of the recent downturn in Azerbaijan and the fact that banks are struggling \nto honor deposits of customers, confidence in the banking  system has been seriously shaken. \nThe ADIF has restored the situation to a degree by compensating depositors. Keeping the ADIF \nin a financially sound position is critical to ensuring public confidence in the banking subsector. \nThe  policy  actions  under  subprogram  1  will  strengthen  deposit  insurance  by  recapitalizing  the \nADIF\u2019s depleting asset base and developing a model for a risk-based pricing methodology to price \npremiums to be charged from banks. This framework will keep the ADIF operationally sustainable \nand  in  turn  provide  impetus  to  local  currency  deposits  in  banks.  The  increased  liquidity  in  the \nbanking system will lead to enhanced credit availability for SMEs. As a supporting measure, the \nNFES has been providing subsidized credit to entrepreneurs through extension of low-cost loans \nto authorized financial  institutions for  onlending to entrepreneurs,  and capping the  spread that \ncan  be  charged  by  the  authorized  lending  institutions  from  the  borrowers.  There  has  been \nsignificant economic activity and jobs generated through the NFES intervention. \n \nD. \n \nThe  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  policy-based  lending  under  a \n21. \nprogrammatic approach in order to support its continuing structural reform agenda. The overall \nprogram is $500 million, and it will comprise two subprograms. The government has requested a \nregular loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. \nSubprogram 2 is also expected to be $250 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n  \n22. \nThe amount of the loan reflects the government\u2019s development financing needs and the \nstrength  and  development  impact  of  the  proposed  policy  reforms  over  the  two  subprograms. \nBased on detailed discussions with the government officials, the following costs of reforms under \nthe  overall  program  were  identified:  (i)  support  the  ADIF  for  meeting  the  obligations  of  banks \ntoward depositors, (ii) support the NFES to help in SME development, and (iii) make the Credit \nGuarantee Fund operational. The subprogram 1 loan will be disbursed in a single tranche and the \nclosing date will be 31 March 2018. The loan size is justified considering the key development \nexpenditures during the program period (Table 1). \n \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nTable 1: Key Reform Costs (2017\u20132018)  \n($ million) \n\nItem \nOne-time budgetary support to ADIF \nBudgetary support to NFES over 2017 and 2018 \nBudgetary support for operationalization of Credit Guarantee Fund \n\nTotal \n\nADIF = Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund, NFES = National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n\nAmount \n320.0 \n180.0 \n200.0 \n700.0 \n\n \n\n\f \n23. \nTable 2 summarizes the total financing requirements if the official repayment of foreign \ncurrency debt principals is included. The estimated 2017 deficit is $1.2 billion. The proposed loan \nwill  help  the  government  partly  cover  these  financing  needs  while  targeting  specific  reform \nexpenditure items. Given the rigidity in nondiscretionary recurrent expenditures (salary, pensions, \nand  interest  payments),  the  impact  of  a  hard  budget  constraint  on  development  financing  has \nbeen found to be negative. It will be difficult for the government to incur additional costs to carry \nout critical reforms unless these are partly financed by the government\u2019s development partners. \nThis is for two reasons: Firstly, there is continued significance of oil transfers in maintaining fiscal \nsustainability, as transfers from SOFAZ continue to be above 40% of state budget revenues since \n2009. Given that a sharp increase in oil prices in the near future appears improbable, transfers to \nsupport the state budget are not expected to jump substantially. Secondly, the fiscal consolidation \nin the medium term can be achieved largely through spending cuts with a strong focus on the \nquality  of  public  spending.  Given  the  distress  which  the  economy  is  currently  in,  delays  in \ngovernment spending on some of these crucial reforms could be counterproductive from a longer \nterm macroeconomic perspective.  \n \n\nTable 2: Fiscal Financing Needs  \n($ billion) \n\nItem \nCentral government overall deficit \nDebt repaymenta \nTotal financing needed \n\n2016 \n0.142 \n0.394 \n0.536 \n\n2017p \n0.790 \n0.449 \n1.239 \n\n2018f \n1.067 \n0.514 \n1.581 \n\n2019f \n1.030 \n0.537 \n1.567 \n\na Official repayments of foreign currency debt principal. \np= provisional, f=forecast \nSource: Official figures for 2016, and Asian Development Bank staff estimates for 2017\u20132019, using different sources. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the executing agency. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan, \n24. \nFinancial  Market  Supervisory  Authority,  Ministry  of  Economy,  and  MOF  are  implementing \nagencies. Both the MOF and Central Bank of Azerbaijan have a well-established track record in \nimplementing reform programs with ADB, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  October  2016  to  November  2017.  The \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is expected to be December 2017 to December 2018. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nThe beneficiaries of subprogram 1 are the citizens of Azerbaijan, who will directly benefit \nfrom  improved  delivery  of  services  and  enhanced  employment  opportunities.  The  proposed \nprogram will have a favorable impact on growth and job creation, both directly and indirectly. The \nintroduction  of  rule-based  fiscal  planning  under  subprogram  1  facilitates  targeted  public \ninvestments in social and economic infrastructure, which in turn will result in improved health and \neducation  services  and  economic  opportunities.  Moreover,  additional  public  investment  will \nstimulate private sector investment and productive activities. SOE reforms under subprogram 1 \nwill  also  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  national  finances.  This  will  originate  primarily  from  three \nsources:  nondebt  capital  receipts  (disinvestment  income),  reduced  fiscal  transfers,  and  higher \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fdividend income. In addition, the government will reduce its contingent liabilities once pensions \nand related retirement liabilities are allocated and funded more efficiently and transparently.12 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n \n26. \nThe government placed combating corruption high on its agenda in 2011, announcing a \nno-tolerance  policy.  Efforts  to  combat  corruption  since  2005  had  resulted  in  important \nimprovements,  which  were  acknowledged  by  regional  anticorruption  bodies  by  2012, 13  and \nAzerbaijan  continued  to  make  progress  in  preventing  corruption  in  several  sectors. 14  This \ncontributed to marked improvements in public perceptions of governance. The findings of a survey \nundertaken by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development across several transition \neconomies in 2016 show a positive public perception; 59% of respondents think that there was \nless corruption in 2016 than in the 4 years before the survey.15 Initiatives such as the National \nAction Plan for 2016\u20132018 on the Promotion of Open Government paved the way for measures \nlike  ASAN  Xidmet. 16  While  punitive  actions  against  certain  senior  officials  suggest  that  the \ngovernment wants to signal a tough approach on corruption, such efforts need to be sustained. A \ndesk review of potential risks and vulnerabilities in the public financial management systems was \nalso undertaken. The review identified vulnerabilities that could impact the program. While budget \ncomprehensiveness and transparency as well as predictability and control in budget execution \nhave improved in recent years in Azerbaijan, weaknesses remain in external and internal audit. \nThis  is  especially  the  case  in  line  ministries,  and  has  been  taken  up  in  the  public  financial \nmanagement action plan adopted by the MOF. The new law on public procurement is expected \nto  facilitate  the  required  changes  in  the  public  procurement  system  for  more  transparent  and \nefficient processes. While improvement of fiscal management is a key reform under the attached \ntechnical assistance, development of the integrated financial system is envisaged in subprogram \n2  to  help  expenditure  tracking.  There  is  also  an  increasing  focus  on  implementation  of \ninternational financial reporting standards in SOEs to improve transparency and accountability. \n \nThe  Government  of  Azerbaijan  has  made  important  progress  in  strengthening  country \n27. \nsystems for transparency and accountability in the extractive industries. Following the withdrawal \nof Azerbaijan from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in March 2017, the president \nissued  a  decree  in  April  2017  that  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  the  high-level  Extractive \nIndustries  Transparency  Commission,  with  SOFAZ  managing  its  secretariat.  The  committee \nassumed its activities in April 2017 and agreed on a stakeholder engagement process that also \ninvolves  civil  society  organizations  in  extractive  industry  transparency-related  tasks  such  as \ncommenting  on  transparency  reports.  ADB\u2019s  planned  support  for  beneficial  ownership  plan \nimplementation will help sustain this progress and the momentum generated by the leadership of \nSOFAZ on extractive industry transparency. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n \n                                                \n12 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 As part of technical assistance support, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the implementation \n\nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, and this was published in 2012. \n\n14 Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  2016.

In May 2016, the State Customs Committee launched a pilot project \nfor electronic declaration of goods and transport aimed at streamlining procedures and improving transparency. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n28. \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  poverty  ratio  was  low  at  4.9%  in  2015.  However,  recent  recession  has \nadversely  affected  Azerbaijan\u2019s  labor  market  with  many  layoffs  in  both  the  public  and  private \nsectors. The number of unemployed rose by 2.5% in 2015 and 14.5% in 2016, after falling by an \naverage of 2.0% annually during 2010\u20132014. The impact of the ongoing recession on the poverty \nratio is expected to be negative, albeit in the short term. The proposed program aims to improve \nlong-term financing in local currency to SMEs, enhance fiscal space to better respond to external \nshocks that affect employment, and improve the efficiency of public sector resource allocation to \nimprove service delivery. These initiatives are expected to have a direct impact on employment \ncreation and poverty reduction. The promotion and protection of gender equality is one of the nine \nstrategic  goals  of  the  government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  development  program,  and  gender \nissues  are  prioritized  in  education,  health,  the  labor  market,  and  in  programs  for  internally \ndisplaced persons and the refugee population. Addressing poverty- and gender-specific problems \nbecomes  more  challenging,  especially  in  a  situation  where  government  is  unable  to  provide \nadequate  funds  for  investment  in  economic  and  social  infrastructure.  The  program\u2019s  special \nemphasis  on  better  expenditure  targeting  with  the  help  of  MTEFs,  especially  in  health  and \neducation, is geared toward protecting poor people and vulnerable groups.   \n \nD. \n \n29. \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nThe major risks to the program are discussed in the risk assessment and management \nplan,  together  with  mitigation  factors  and  measures.  Table  3  presents  the  risks  that  are  either \nsubstantial or high (premitigation levels), and that are, to an important extent, out of control of the \nprogram.  The  overall  assessment  for  the  risk  level  of  the  program  is  moderate  (premitigation \nlevels).  Fiduciary  arrangements  for  budget  support  are  acceptable,  and  the  strengthening  of \npublic financial management is one of the key objectives of the program. While no significant risks \nof mismanagement of resources at the executing level are expected, relevant issues identified in \nthe assessments are also targeted in the proposed loan and the  ongoing technical assistance. \nThis will provide, by default, close levels of engagement and monitoring that provide at this stage \nan important degree of fiduciary comfort.17  \n \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nSafeguards \n\nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nResponsibility \n\nRisk Description  Rating \nReform Sustainability \nLeadership and \npolitical will to \ncomplete the \nreforms weakens \nbecause of \nvested interests \n\nS \n\nMOF and ADB \n\nGovernment of Azerbaijan has been announcing and \nimplementing reforms since mid-2015, and the \nimplementing agencies of the proposed program (i.e., \nCBA, FMSA, MOE, and MOF) were strongly engaged \nin discussions with ADB and ADB TA experts over the \nmost challenging reform needs under their respective \nmandates.
