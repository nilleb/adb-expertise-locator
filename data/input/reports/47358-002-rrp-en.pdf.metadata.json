\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Enhancing Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Apia \nPort Project. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  efficiency,  safety,  and  environmental  sustainability  of  the \nseaport in Apia, Samoa. It will upgrade terminal infrastructure to enhance safety and capacity, \nstrengthen existing breakwater to enhance resilience to climate change and severe storms, and \nconstruct  a  customs  facility  with  a  new  container  x-ray  scanner  to  enable  effective  border \nmanagement.  The  project  will  also  support  gender-sensitive  green  port  initiatives  (GPIs)  to \npromote clean and sustainable port operations and management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nRegional context and maritime transport challenges. Samoa lies south of the equator, \nabout halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, in the Polynesian region of the Pacific Ocean. \nIt has a population of about 200,000, an estimated nominal domestic product of $835.8 million in \n2018, and a land area of 2,820 square kilometers, which consists of the two large islands of Upolu \nand Savai\u2019i as well as eight small islets.1 The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters \nof Samoa\u2019s population, and to the capital city, Apia. Given the geographical isolation from major \ninternational markets, maritime connectivity is critical to the economy, which heavily depends on \nagricultural exports, and imports of basic commodities. \n \nThe port is the country\u2019s only international maritime gateway. It was first constructed with \n4. \nNew  Zealand  grant  aid  in  1966.  Between  1988  and  2015,  the  Government  of  Japan  provided \nassistance for various port improvements, such as construction of the original breakwater in 1988, \nrehabilitation after cyclone damage in 1992, and wharf extension to accommodate cruise liners in \n2015.  In  2018,  the  port  handled  37,091  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEUs)  of  containers, \nincluding 4,470 TEUs for transshipment and 15 cruise liners. By 2035, the container demand is \nprojected  to  increase  to  51,534  TEUs,  including  5,153  TEUs  for  transshipment  and  20  cruise \nliners. Although the port has sufficient berth capacity, the capacity of its terminal is inadequate, \none  tugboat  is  past  its  design  life,  and  the  breakwater  is  so  damaged  that  it  is  inadequate  to \nwithstand climate change impacts and natural disasters. Trade facilitation is suboptimal because \nthe customs processing system is inefficient. Moreover, coordinated efforts at the port to tackle \nenvironmental  issues  for  long-term  sustainability  are  lacking.  The  proposed  project  will \ncomplement earlier donor efforts in four main areas. \n \n5. \nSafety  and  capacity.  Technical  assessments  estimated  that  1.9  hectares  of  gross \ncontainer terminal area are required to meet projected container demand by 2035. The current \neffective  gross  container  terminal  area  is  only  1.4  hectares  because  of  leases  to  non-port \nactivities,  the  container-handling  flow  is  inefficient  because  of  damaged  areas  within  the  port \nterminal, and the location of utilities is suboptimal. The project will repair the damaged areas of \nthe wharf deck, upgrade the lighting, provide suitable pavement and additional reefer container \ncapacity, and reconfigure the layout of the container terminal for greater efficiency. \n \n6. \nCurrently, the vessels calling at the port are served by two tugboats (Tafola and Atafa) \nthat are insufficiently powered to meet even current requirements. Tafola is past its design life \n(30 years) and poses navigational safety concerns. Atafa has up to 5 years left in its design life, \n\n                                                \n1  Samoa Bureau of Statistics. 2019. http://www.sbs.gov.ws  \n \n\n \n\n\fafter which a replacement would be needed. Ideally, two higher-powered tugboats should replace \nboth vessels. However, due to funding constraints, a phased approach will be taken to first replace \nTafola under the project.2 \n \nPort operations are also constrained by seasonal waves entering the harbor basin during \n7. \nthe wet season (November\u2013April), which makes berthing unsafe.3 The project will implement a \nwave-monitoring system and develop an early-warning system to enhance navigation safety at \nthe port. \n \n8. \nResilience to climate change and natural disasters. Samoa has historically suffered \nfrom disasters triggered by cyclones, earthquakes, and associated tsunamis. The breakwater at \nthe  port  is  currently  damaged,  and  wave  modeling  revealed  that  it  will  suffer  severe  damage \nduring  a  100-year  storm  event.4 It  is  essential  to  enhance  the  resilience  of  the  breakwater  to \nprotect the port and enable it to operate in the aftermath of disasters to receive vessels carrying \naid and emergency supplies. The project will rehabilitate and upgrade the existing breakwater to \nwithstand the 100-year design storm condition and a 50-year sea level rise. It will also implement \nnon-structural  measures,  such  as  formulating  a  multihazard  disaster  preparedness  plan \n(MHDPP), to mitigate disruption of port operations in the aftermath of a disaster event. \n \n9. \nBorder  security  and  trade  facilitation.  Currently,  customs  examination  at  the  port \ninvolves manual inspection of containers in an open area with limited space. Smuggling of illicit \ndrugs  and  weapons  through  sophisticated  concealment  is  a  growing  concern.  Catering  to \nincreasing trade through the port would require enhanced border security and trade facilitation.5 \nSamoa\u2019s Customs Legislation requires introduction of a non-intrusive inspection equipment as a \ntool to streamline and strengthen border security. The project will provide a new container x-ray \nscanner and related facilities. The Government of New Zealand is currently providing long-term \nsupport  to  the  Ministry  for  Revenue  (MFR)  to  develop  capacity-building  programs  on  border \ncontrol. Once the new container x-ray scanner is in place, the Government of New Zealand would \nsupport  MFR in implementing a modern risk-based, intelligent customs management system as \npart of its ongoing capacity development program. \n \n10. \nGender-sensitive green port. At present, there is a lack of coordinated effort at the port \nto manage the environment and optimize operational and energy efficiency. This undermines the \nlong-term sustainability of port operations. The project will develop a green port policy (GPP) and \npilot  GPIs  to  promote  more  environmentally  sustainable  practices  at  Samoa  Ports  Authority \n(SPA).  This  will  be  developed  based  on  an  audit  of  SPA\u2019s  performance  against  green  port \nindicators  from  international  best  practice  and  maritime  conventions  (footnote  3).  It  will  also \ninclude gender analyses to ensure that the GPP and GPIs address any particular impacts of port \noperations  on  women  communities.  Further,  the  project  will  promote  greater  participation  of \nwomen employees in SPA\u2019s technical management roles to operationalize the GPP and GPIs, by \nproviding  training  opportunities  on  state-of-the-art  environmental  management  practices. \nCollectively, this is well aligned with the government\u2019s vision in the Samoa Transport Sector Plan \n(2014\u20132019)  of  delivering  sustainable  transport  networks  that  support  Samoa\u2019s  economic  and \nsocial development and enhance the quality of life for all Samoans. \n \n\n                                                \n2  Atafa will be considered for replacement as soon as other funds are identified. \n3  A feasibility study was conducted, and a preliminary green port concept developed, under Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). 2015.

Since the DRR activities address climate-related \ndisaster risks and considered the impacts of climate change on extreme weather events, the DRR \nactions also contribute wholly to climate change adaptation, of which 100% is funded by ADB.12 \n \nE. \n \n21. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  the  implementing \nagencies will be SPA and the MFR. MOF will provide overall oversight and coordination through \nits project steering committee. SPA will lead the PMU in day-to-day project management in line \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines and in coordination with the project steering committee. SPA will procure \nthe civil  works  and  consulting  contracts,  and  SPA  and  the  MFR  will  procure the  equipment,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \nGuidelines for the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).

The reconstruction of the breakwater will take place in at least two phases \nto avoid the wet season. The risk of damage to the breakwater under extreme seismic events was \nassessed.  Both  the  detailed  design  consultant  and  the  IPR  concluded  that  it  would  be \nuneconomical and impractical to fully mitigate the seismic risks using structural measures.14 The \nproject  team  will  develop  alternative  nonstructural  measures,  such  as  an  MHDPP.  On  the \nlandside, repairs will be done to various damaged sections of the wharf deck, the fuel line, and \nelectrical duct lids. The lighting will be upgraded to provide safe operating standards. New reefer \nfacilities  will  be  provided  to  meet  the  forecast  requirements.  The  design  also  includes  new \nstormwater  drainage  and  three  classes  of  heavy-duty  pavement  to  ensure  cost-effectiveness \nwhile  maintaining  operational  flexibility.  The  container  terminal  layout  will  be  reconfigured  with \nnew fencing, to enhance safety and efficiency. For efficiency, the port component and the small \ncivil works to construct the customs examination facility will be packaged as a single civil works \npackage. \n \n26. \nFor the trade facilitation component, the project will finance the procurement of a container \nx-ray  scanner  that  meets  the  minimum  regulatory  standards  set  by  the  World  Customs \nOrganization. The supply contract for the container x-ray scanner will include a 2-year warranty \nperiod  and  the  provision  of  training,  and  the  government  will  finance  a  5-year  maintenance \ncontract with the supplier after the end of the warranty. To avoid potential damage from outdoor \noperations,  a  new  customs  examination  facility  will  be  constructed  to  house  the  new  scanner \noperations. \n \n27. \nThe level of project readiness is high, since the detailed designs of the breakwater, port \nterminal,  and  the  new  customs  examination  facility  are  at  an  advanced  stage,  funded  by  the \nproject  design  advance  facility.  The  bidding  documents  for  the  equipment  and  civil  works  are \nexpected to be ready in the early fourth quarter of 2019. \n\n                                                \n14 The IPR was engaged under the project design advance facility. \n\n\f7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe 30-year old tugboat (Tafola) has exceeded its operational lifespan and needs to be \n28. \nreplaced as soon as possible. Currently, it is operating on only one of its two engines, and steel \ncorrosion  is  evident  throughout  the  vessel.  Any  repairs  would  be  costly  and  provide  limited \nextension to its service life. The tugboat supply contract will include a 2-year warranty period and \nthe provision of training, and the government will finance a 5-year maintenance contract with the \nsupplier after the end of the warranty. \n \nB. \n \n29. \nThe project will allow SPA and the MFR to ensure that basic operating needs are met and \nthat the movement of people and goods across Samoa\u2019s border is safe and secure. Improved \nmaritime  infrastructure  will  ensure  that  the  port  is  resilient  to  climate  change  and  can  remain \noperational in the aftermath of disasters triggered by natural hazards such as cyclones. \n \n30. \nTo assess the project\u2019s economic viability, standard cost\u2013benefit analysis is inapplicable \nbecause  of  the  basic-needs  nature  of  the  components.  Significant  benefits  arise  from  safety, \nsecurity, and resilience to climate change and natural hazards, which cannot be fully quantified \nfor  comparison  with  investment  costs  since  substantial  damage  is  expected  if  the  breakwater \nwere  to  be  damaged.  The  potential  damages  would  severely  impact  shipping  lines  and  the \neconomy since Apia Port is the primary international gateway and serves as economic lifeline to \nSamoa. The potential breach of safety if vessel navigation took place without operational tugboats \ncould result in devastating impacts on passenger and cargo vessels. For the customs component, \nit  is  necessary  to  bring  Samoa\u2019s  customs  in  line  with  minimum  international  standards  by \nstrengthening border security. \n \nA basic-needs perspective or one of basic public goods and services provision is more \n31. \napplicable since it considers that the without-project scenario would negatively impact livelihoods \nif the population were unable to import basic goods. The detailed scope of port components was \nverified and confirmed by the IPR as being the cost-effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis was \napplied to evaluate the project following ADB guidelines.15 The assessment confirms the need for \n(i) reconstruction of the breakwater instead of patch repair; (ii) essential deck and yard repairs \nand strengthening of pavements, including lighting, renewal of the electrical supply network, and \nprovision of sufficient standby generation; (iii) provision of the container x-ray scanner; and (iv) \nimmediate replacement of the tugboat that is past its design life. \n \n32. \nA  financial  analysis  and  financial  capacity  assessment  was  undertaken  following  ADB \nguidelines. 16 Although  the  port  components  was  found  to  be  financially  unviable,  and  hence \nunattractive for  private  sector  investment, the financial  sustainability  analysis  confirms  that the \nincome  from  overall  port  operations  would  be  sufficient  to  cover  recurring  expenses  for  the \nmaintenance of the new infrastructure. However, the pre-mitigated financial sustainability risk was \nsubstantial because of the risk of inadequate spending on asset maintenance by SPA, and the \nMFR\u2019s  reliance  on  government  funding  for  maintenance  of  the  new  x-ray  scanner,  leading  to \npossible  degradation  of  the  assets.  Therefore,  SPA  and  MFR  have  agreed  to    the  following \nmitigating measures: (i) assurances designed to require SPA to establish a separate reserve fund \nearmarked for maintenance of the assets provided under the project and (ii) assurances requiring \nthe MFR to implement cost recovery charges to cover the recurring  maintenance requirements \nof the new x-ray scanner and customs facilities. \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n33. \nThe assessment of state-owned enterprise governance concluded that SPA\u2019s governance \nis  largely  consistent  with  international  best  practice.  Areas  of  strength  include  the  overall \ngovernance framework, board independence, strategy setting, and the role of the chief executive \nofficer. Since many of the reforms are recent, SPA and the government need to show sustained \ncommitment to implementing them effectively. The biggest challenge to SPA\u2019s governance comes \nfrom the overlapping oversight by two ministries and the cabinet, and the ambiguities this creates. \nSeparate technical assistance will be provided to support the legal reforms needed to solve this, \nand to develop a policy that better insures SPA against disasters triggered by natural hazards.17 \n \n34. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  SPA  has  adequate  capacity  to \nundertake the financial management of ADB-financed projects. Although this would be ADB\u2019s first \ninvestment project in the ports and customs subsectors of Samoa, SPA has completed its fourth \nport project financed by the Government of Japan since the 1990s. The pre-mitigated financial \nmanagement  risk  was  assessed  as substantial, mainly  because  of the  lack  of  experience  with \nADB-funded projects. The risk to financial management is mitigated by the fact that SPA has in-\nhouse  staff  with  experience  in  ADB  procedures.  Also,  the  newly  established  PMU  comprises \npermanent  staff  from  both  SPA  and  the  MFR.  The  project  will  provide  additional  support  from \nconsultants experienced in project implementation and safeguards. MOF, the executing agency, \nis  experienced  in  handling several  ongoing  ADB  and  other  donor-funded  projects.  MOF,  SPA, \nand  the  MFR  also  received  training  on  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  in  the  first \nquarter of 2019. \n \n35. \nThe  project  procurement  risk  assessment  concluded  that  both  SPA and the MFR  have \nlimited  resources  and  experience  to  support  the  preparation,  procurement,  and  contract \nsupervision of development-partner-financed infrastructure projects. This risk is being mitigated \nby the ongoing project design advance, and will be further mitigated during project implementation \n(Table 4). Procurement and engagement of consulting services will be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines for \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n36. \nIntegrity due diligence on SPA identified no significant integrity risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOF, \nSPA, and the MFR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the PAM. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nClimate and disaster resilience of the lifeline port, and efficiencies delivered by customs \nreform will boost the competitiveness of trade, particularly Samoan exports. This will stimulate the \neconomy, generate local employment, and increase domestic and international trade. The tourism \nand construction industries would benefit as well and create more domestic jobs for both skilled \nand nonskilled labor. \n \nThe project is classified some gender elements. Proactive gender design features focus \n38. \nprimarily on upskilling and employment for women through (i) a gender audit of SPA to ensure \nmore gender-sensitive and responsive ways of working, and to encourage more women into the \nworkplace, particularly in technical and management positions; (ii) gender analysis and actions in \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n17 ADB.  2019.

The  environmental  assessment  identifies  the  impact  from \n40. \nbreakwater  reconstruction  as  loss  of  about  10,000  square  meters  of  highly  modified  benthic \nhabitat of low ecological value; such impacts are considered minor. Impacts on the western reef \nor on the movement of turtles are not anticipated. Risks associated with the x-ray scanner will be \nmitigated by installing the equipment in a specially designed building with screens, and by training \nstaff. Provided the measures included in the environmental monitoring plan are implemented, the \nproject  impacts  are  considered  to  be  minor.  The  PAM  details  the  institutional  arrangements \nproposed to ensure the implementation of environmental safeguards during the project. \n \n41. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). No physical or economic displacement will result \nfrom the project. The project will be implemented within the existing port area, which belongs to \nSPA. Two existing private lessees in the port area will be affected due to termination and non-\nrenewal of their expired lease. SPA negotiated with the lessees in accordance with their existing \ncontract and the lessees will not experience significant impacts. The due diligence also confirmed \nthat no legacy issues exist that would require corrective actions on the site. All key stakeholders \nwere consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. \n \n42. \nIndigenous peoples (category C). The port development is not expected to have any \nimpacts  on  indigenous  peoples  considered  as  distinct  and  vulnerable  because  of  their \nendogeneity. \n \nF. \n \n43. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernance and financial management \nSPA\u2019s internal audit function does \nnot report directly to the audit \ncommittee. \n\nAs an interim measure, the audit committee will hold meetings with the head \nof internal audit, without management present, at least once a year. \n\n                                                \n18 Examples may include the upskilling of women on state-of-the-art environmental practices in areas such as air and \nwater quality management. The GPP will also address the impact of, for example, marine, air, and noise pollution on \nwomen in the communities surrounding the port. Examples of gender aspects in the MHDPP may include increased \nleadership  responsibilities  and  training  opportunities  for  women;  gender-sensitive  early-warning  systems,  and \nassurance that information related to disasters is gender-sensitive and discussed with women in nearby communities; \ncollection  of  sex-disaggregated  post-disaster  data;  and training  on  tackling  gender-based violence and  trafficking \nafter a disaster. \n\n19 New Zealand is currently supporting the MFR in developing capacity-building programs on border control; this will \nextend  to  building  the  capacity  required  for  incorporating  the  x-ray  scanner  operations  into  the  new  risk-based \ncustoms management system. \n\n20 ADB.
