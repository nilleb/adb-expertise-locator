Indonesia also made significant strides in reducing poverty as its incidence \ndeclined from  16.6%  in 2007  to  12%  in 2012.  At  the same time,  despite  the  declining  poverty \nincidence,  the  country  experienced  a  steady  rise  in  inequality  as  shown  by  an  increasing  Gini \ncoefficient.  The  government\u2019s  Master  Plan  for  Acceleration  and  Expansion  of  Indonesia\u2019s \nEconomic  Development,  2011\u20132025  (MP3EI)  aims  to  achieve  higher  and  more  inclusive \neconomic growth based on  a three-pillar  strategy:  (i)  spreading  economic  development  across \nthe  country  through  development  of  six  economic  corridors,  (ii)  improving  domestic  and \ninternational  connectivity,  and  (iii)  enhancing  technology  and  human  resources.  The  MP3EI \nincludes regulatory reforms as an integral initial step in accelerating economic development that \nADB could appropriately support through a policy-based loan. The proposed subprogram 2 will \nsupport the continuation of reforms achieved under the first subprogram on the second strategic \npillar of the MP3EI.2 The government has implemented further reforms aimed at improving the \npolicy,  regulatory, financial,  institutional,  and  business  climate frameworks for connectivity  and \ninfrastructure  development.  A  stronger  enabling  environment  for  domestic  and  international \nconnectivity will in turn enable more infrastructure investments by the public and private sectors \nto support sustainable, higher, and more inclusive economic growth. Now, as economic growth \nhas  started  to  slow  down,  there  is  increased  urgency  to  advance  implementation  of  these \nreforms to accelerate connectivity improvement and infrastructure development in general. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nIndonesia\u2019s economic growth  performance and  infrastructure. After reaching 6.5% \nin  2011  (the  highest  since  the  Asian  crisis  1997\u20131998),  economic  growth  declined  to  6.2%  in \n2012 following the recession in the eurozone and lower growth in Indonesia\u2019s other key trading \npartners.  Economic  growth  weakened  further  in  the  first  quarter  of  2013  due  to  slower  than \nexpected  recovery  of  demand for  the  country\u2019s  exports.  Given  the  slow  recovery  in  the  global \neconomy, the government now recognizes the need to accelerate infrastructure-related reforms \nand  investments  to  remove  the  obstacles  that  keep  the  country  from  reaching  its  growth \npotential.3 An Asian Development Bank (ADB) study highlights inadequacies in infrastructure as \na  critical  constraint  on  economic  growth. 4  After  increasing  its  infrastructure  spending,  and \nimplementing reforms to support infrastructure development, Indonesia\u2019s global competitiveness \nindex  ranking  rose  by  12  places  to  38  in  the  2013  Global  Competitiveness  Index.5 However, \nsignificant challenges remain. Although Indonesia\u2019s ranking on infrastructure has moved up by \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2012.

Manila. \n\n3   For  2014\u20132016,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  had  estimated  a  baseline  potential  growth  rate  of  7.1%, \n\nwhich would increase to 7.9% if infrastructure development and economic reforms were accelerated. \n\n4   H. Hill, M. E. Khan, and J. Zhuong, eds. 2012. Diagnosing the Indonesian Economy: Toward Inclusive and Green \n\nGrowth. London: Asian Development Bank / Anthem Press. \n\n5  World Economic Forum. 2013.

The impact of lagging infrastructure still appears in a number of forms. Deteriorating \nroads in the provinces and districts increase domestic transport and logistics costs. Congested \nports  and  underdeveloped  interisland  transport  have  led  to  high  domestic  shipping  costs. \nCongested and underdeveloped international ports also limit a deeper integration of Indonesia\u2019s \nmanufacturing sector into international production networks.  \n \n\nFigure 1: Global Competitiveness Index Ranking \nfor Connectivity Infrastructure, 2013\u20132014  \n(out of 148 countries) \n\nFigure 2: Poverty Incidence by Location, March 2013  \n(% of population) \n\n \n Source:  World  Economic  Forum.  2013.

Despite  slightly  declining  growth  in  2012,  the \nunemployment rate declined from 6.3% in February 2012 to 5.9% in February 2013. The quality \nof  employment  also  improved  further  thanks  to  a  greater  size  of  the  economy's  productive \nsector, illustrated by 3.5 million more jobs in the formal sector and 2.3 million fewer jobs in the \ninformal  sector.  This  helped  reduce  the  poverty  rate  to  11.4%  in  March  2013,  from  12.0%  in \nMarch  2012.  However,  formidable  efforts  are  needed  to  reduce  the  poverty  incidence  further. \nThe  share  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force  employed  in  the  informal  sector,  where  wages  and  job \nsecurity  are  low,  is  still  high  at  60.0%.  While  the  overall  poverty  rate  has  trended  downward, \nachievement  varies  across  the  country  as  economic  development  is  still  centered  in  western \nIndonesia and in urban areas. The national rural poverty rate of 14.3% is much higher than the \nnational urban poverty rate of 8.4%. Poverty rates in some provinces in eastern Indonesia are \nmuch higher than elsewhere in the country\u2014e.g., 24.0% in Maluku and Papua (Figure 2). At the \nsame time, inequality was rising steadily until 2012, with the Gini coefficient reaching 0.41.  \n \n5. \nInclusive  growth  through  better  developed  connectivity.  Alleviating  the  country\u2019s \nmultidimensional  poverty  will  require  not  only  accelerated  economic  growth  but  also  a  more \ninclusive  growth  process  that  provides  rural  areas  and  disadvantaged  regions  with  greater \neconomic  opportunity  and  access  to  social  services.  Improving  and  developing  the  country\u2019s \nconnectivity  is  key  to  reducing  the  poverty  incidence.  First,  improving  intraisland  connectivity \nbetween rural areas with regional growth poles will reduce rural poverty through lower transport \ncosts and widen access to markets and services. Second, improving connectivity between the \npoorer  eastern  parts  of  Indonesia  with  markets  in  western  areas  through  more  efficient \ninterisland transport systems will help reduce development gaps and poverty through increased \ndomestic  trade  and  larger  economic  opportunities  in  the  eastern  provinces.  Finally,  improving \ninternational connectivity to boost the competitiveness of the country\u2019s  tradable sector will help \ngenerate  more  productive  jobs  in  the  formal  sector.  Combined,  these  connectivity  efforts  are \n\n2 \n\n \n\n229476196224373859SingaporeMalaysiaThailandIndonesiaPhilippinesInfrastructureOverall8.49.68.5 11.2 4.0 5.7 6.1 14.312.7 14.4 16.7 8.1 14.0 31.4 11.411.510.9 14.5 6.4 11.2 24.0 NationalSumatraJawaBali and Nusa TenggaraKalimantanSulawesiMaluku and PapuaUrban Rural  Urban and Rural\fexpected to have a key role in increasing access to and delivery of services, thereby enhancing \neconomic productivity and social well-being, and reducing the overall poverty incidence. \n \n6. \nConvergence  of  government  national  strategies  and  ADB  strategy.  The \ngovernment  recognizes  that  lagging  infrastructure,  underdeveloped  intraisland  and  interisland \nconnectivity,  weak  international  connectivity,  and  inefficient  logistics  constrain  achievement  of \nits medium- and long-term targets of higher growth and faster poverty reduction. The policy to \nreduce  fuel  subsidies  introduced  in  June  2013  will  provide  significant  fiscal  space  to  support \nlarger  infrastructure  spending  in  2014  and  beyond.  Strategically,  the  government\u2019s  National \nMedium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014  provides  direction  for  the  two  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s \nIndonesia  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014:  inclusive  growth  and  environmental \nsustainability.6 Reforms assisted by the proposed program will support the inclusive growth pillar \nof the country partnership strategy. In addition, improving connectivity is a strategic focus of the \nMP3EI.  The  MP3EI  will  guide  the  convergence  of  ADB\u2019s  policy-based,  sector,  and  thematic \ninterventions  related  to  connectivity  and  the  government\u2019s  vision  of  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment.  \n  \n7. \nLessons  from  ADB  policy-based  loans  and  development  coordination.  Several \nlessons  from  the  previous  country  strategy  for  Indonesia  (2006\u20132009)  and  support  for  policy-\nbased loans were considered.7 Achieving tangible results with ADB\u2019s relatively modest program \nrequires  selective  support  targeting  key  government  priorities  and  use  of  programmatic \napproaches  in  coordination  with  other  development  partners.  Specifically,  ADB  effectiveness \ncan be increased by (i) concentrating on a more limited set of program areas where there are \nclear synergies between ADB\u2019s policy, project, and private sector support, (ii) focusing on core \nsectors  identified  by  Strategy  2020  and  emphasizing  sectors  where  ADB  has  a  strong  track \nrecord,8 and (iii) supporting operations where ADB can play a catalytic role with good prospects \nfor collaboration with other partners. The program will involve collaborative cofinancing with the \nWorld  Bank  and  the  Government  of  Japan.  In  addition,  ADB  coordinates  with  the  Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  on  infrastructure  issues  through  its  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Initiative  Project  in  Indonesia  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Infrastructure \nAssistance  Program  technical  assistance  cluster,  which  is  financed  by  the  Government  of \nAustralia. 9  This  connectivity-related  policy-based  loan  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  earlier  policy-based \nloans,  notably  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program,  which  supported \ngovernment  reforms  to  improve  regulatory  frameworks;  open  up  key  infrastructure  sectors  for \nprivate sector participation, including public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs); increase competition; \nand improve infrastructure.10 A key lesson from ADB's experience is to simplify the program to \nfocus on high-impact policy reforms.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe program\u2019s impact will be to reduce transport and logistics costs, a key requirement \n8. \nfor  achieving  higher  and  more  inclusive  economic  growth  that  is  sustained  over  the  medium \nterm. The outcome will be more developed domestic and international connectivity anchored on \n\n                                                \n6   ADB. 2012.

Manila (Loan 4025-INO).  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nrigorous  coordination  and  regulation,  which  will  help  generate  more  and  better  jobs  and \ncontribute to sustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nThe  programmatic  approach  consists  of  two  subprograms  sequenced  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term  reforms  to  strengthen domestic  and  international  connectivity.  The \nproposed  policy-based  loan  will  support  subprogram  2.  The  overall  program  supports  the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  in  four  core  reform  areas:  (i) strengthening  national  coordination, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks  for  more  effective  implementation  of  the  connectivity \nagenda; (ii) strengthening intraisland connectivity to and from growth centers, with optimal use \nof resources for sustainable improvement and maintenance of land transportation and networks; \n(iii) improving  interisland  connectivity  by  stepping  up  efficiencies  and  service  performance  of \ndomestic  air  and  sea  transportation;  and  (iv)  enhancing  international  connectivity  by  making \nIndonesia\u2019s  ports  more  efficient  in  handling  traffic  and  trade  volume.  The  policy  actions  have \nbeen  developed  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  government\u2019s  development  efforts  and \ninitiatives,  as  outlined  in  the  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132014  and  the \nMP3EI, 2011\u20132025 (Appendix 4). After completing all policy actions under subprogram 1 in mid-\nSeptember 2012, the government has made significant progress in implementing  policy actions \nfor  subprogram  2.11 Of  the  11  policy  actions  originally  envisaged  for  subprogram  2,  ten  have \nbeen completed.  The policy action related to the establishment of the new Indonesia National \nSingle  Window  (INSW)  agency  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  early  2014.  Three  more \nsignificant  policy  actions  have  been  added  into  the  policy  matrix  to  reflect  the  government\u2019s \nreform priority.12  \n \n\nNational \n\nlogistics  blueprint  and  debottlenecking  mechanism \n\nConnectivity Coordination and Regulatory Frameworks Strengthened \n\n1. \n \n10. \nThe  policy  reforms  will  strengthen  coordination  across  institutions  and  harmonize \nregulations  related  to  connectivity  infrastructure  and  logistics.  While  the  government  has \nestablished working groups to coordinate and monitor implementation of the three pillars of the \nMP3EI  activities,  their  operational  effectiveness  has  been  constrained  by  an  ineffective \nmechanism  for  reaching  collective  decisions  on  priority  infrastructure  and  by  the  lack  of  a \nbudget mechanism for financing project preparation.  \n \n11. \nfor  priority \ninfrastructure.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  issued  a  national  logistics  blueprint  to \nspecify  short-  and  medium-term  reform  targets.  In  support  of  the  connectivity  agenda,  under \nsubprogram  2,  the  government  has  developed  and  operationalized  a  working  team  to  monitor \nand  evaluate  the  implementation  of  the  national  logistics  blueprint.  CMEA  also  established  a \nmechanism to resolve issues that cause delay in the implementation of priority projects. \n \n12. \nInfrastructure  Delivery.  The \ngovernment has identified various bottlenecks in the development of priority infrastructure. For \nPPPs,  these  include  lack  of  coordination  and  capacity  in  preparing  bankable  projects  to  meet \ninternational  standards. For  infrastructure in general, the government  is yet  to develop  a  clear \nbudget  mechanism for financing  a  pre-feasibility  study  in  preparation  of  infrastructure  projects. \nTo rectify these issues, CMEA has drafted a presidential decree aimed at revitalizing the Policy \n                                                \n11  Policy actions are policy triggers for the loan (noted in bold in the policy matrix [Appendix 4]). Policy milestones, while \nimportant  in  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  program,  are  not  policy  triggers  for  the  loan.  They  are  presented  to \ndemonstrate additional reforms implemented by the government. \n\nPolicy  Committee  for  Acceleration  of  Priority \n\n12  Appendix 4 shows all of the changes introduced into the policy matrix.  \n\n\fCommittee  for  Acceleration  of  Priority  Infrastructure  Delivery  (KKPPI)  by  streamlining  its \nstructure  and  strengthening  its  function  and  its  secretariat.  With  its  revitalization,  KKPPI  is  to \nfunction  as  a  collective  decision-making  body  for  all  stakeholders  to  (i)  develop  infrastructure \npolicy and priorities, (ii) coordinate implementation of a pre-feasibility study to determine which \ninfrastructure  is  to  be  financed  by  which  sources  (e.g.,  public  sector,  state-owned  enterprises, \nprivate  sector,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  development  partners);  (iii)  set  standards  for  the \nquality of project preparation; and (iv) help remove bottlenecks in infrastructure development.  \n \nViability  gap  fund  to  support  public\u2013private  partnerships.  Recognizing  the  limited \n13. \npublic resources available to meet the country\u2019s large financing needs for future infrastructure, \nthe  government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  attract  and  leverage  private  financing  of \ninfrastructure through PPPs. While some PPP projects are socially and economically desirable, \nthey are not always financially viable due to limited cost-recovery prospects through user fees or \ntariffs.  This  low  degree  of  cost  recovery  has  constrained  private  sector  interest,  underscoring \nthe need to close the financial viability gap with public resources. The government is setting up \na viability gap fund (VGF) to provide public financial support to well-prepared PPP projects and \nso  boost  their  bankability  and  financial  viability.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Ministry  of  Finance \n(MOF)  prepared  a  draft  ministerial  decree  for  the  establishment  of  the  fund.  Under \nsubprogram 2,  MOF  issued  ministerial  decree  No.  223/PMK011/2012  on  implementation \nguidelines  for  the  VGF.  The  decree  specifies  clear  eligibility  criteria  for  VGF  support,  the \napproval  processes,  and  VGF  allocation  and  disbursement,  as  well  as  contractual  and \nmonitoring arrangements. In addition, MOF has drafted the framework and business process of \na PPP unit within the ministry. The PPP unit is expected to be developed into an anchor PPP \ncenter in the medium term to mainstream PPP implementation. \n \n\nIntraisland Connectivity Upgraded \n\n2. \n \n14. \nImproving  intraisland  connectivity  is  an  important  part  of  the  government\u2019s  connectivity \nstrategy  to  reduce  rural  poverty.  The  policy  reforms  will  support  its  efforts  to  accelerate \ndevelopment of transport systems and infrastructure to improve access from rural areas to the \nnearest growth centers and between industrial zones and ports. Linking rural areas with growth \ncenters  within  islands  is  constrained  by  inadequate  road  infrastructure,  delays  in  land \nacquisition, and substandard maintenance of the existing road network.  \n \n15. \nLand acquisition. The difficulty in acquiring land for public use has been a key reason \nfor  the  late  disbursement  of  the  government\u2019s  capital  spending  in  the  transport  sector.  The \nprivate  sector  considers  the  land  acquisition  problem  a  major  source  of  uncertainty  in  project \ndevelopment, costs, and implementation, lowering investor confidence on the prospects for road \ninvestment. It also has delayed the development of PPPs, particularly for toll roads. Overcoming \nthis  constraint  is  key  to  advancing  the  connectivity  and  infrastructure  agenda.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the government achieved significant progress through the passage of the  Land \nAcquisition  Law  for  Public  Use  (Law  No.  2/2012)  and  the  issuance  of  Presidential  Decree \nNo. 71/2012.  Subprogram  2  supports  further  progress  in  this  area  by  the  issuance  of  the \nMinister  of  Finance  Regulation  No.  13/PMK.02/2013,  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  Regulation  No. \n72/2012  ,  and  the  Head  of  National  Land  Agency  Regulation  No.  5/2012.    These final  sets  of \nregulatory framework provide guidelines for operational costs for land acquisition for public use \nand  its  implementation  by  local  governments.  The  new  regulatory  framework  reallocates \nresponsibilities  from  districts  and  provinces  to  BPN  to  ensure  a  more  consistent  national \napproach.  \n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nPerformance-based  contract  and  national  road  network.  The  Directorate  General \n16. \nHighway  within the  Ministry  of  Public Works  issued  Circular  No.06/SE/06/2012  recommending \nthe  use  of  performance-based  contracting  for  any  road  project  was  supported  under \nsubprogram  1.  The  circular  provides  an  opportunity  to  mainstream  the  performance-based \ncontract  into  national  road  management  practices.  It  will  help  improve  road  preservation \nmanagement  by  phasing  out  the  force  account  approach  and  boost  efficiency  through \ncompetition.  Directorate  General  Highway  has  expanded  its  implementation  to  three  roads  in \nCentral  Java  under  subprogram  2.  Directorate  General  Highway  also  issued  a  circular  on \nmedium-term  national  network  to  support  the  implementation  of  road  connectivity  across \neconomic corridors under the MP3EI.  \n\n \n\n17.  Mechanism  for  allocation  of  grant  funds  to  subnational  governments.  The  public \nexpenditure review of the road sector by the World Bank finds that 24% of provincial roads and \n41% of district roads are in bad or poor condition.13 The performance is better for national roads, \nwhere  only  12%  are  in  bad  or  poor  condition.  To  start  tackling  this  problem,  the  government \nintroduced a pilot mechanism for reimbursable road maintenance in eastern Indonesia. Under it, \nthe national government will disburse road infrastructure grant funds to local governments only if \nthey meet pre-agreed road maintenance quality and performance standards. \n \n\n3. \n\nInterisland Connectivity Improved \n\n \n18. \nThe  key  objectives  of  interisland  connectivity  reforms  are  to  strengthen  the  policy \nframework to step up port productivity and to improve transport access in eastern Indonesia. In \na  large,  archipelagic  country  with  a  dispersed  population,  reducing  the  cost  of  interisland \nshipping  is  expected  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction by connecting islands through lower-cost and higher-volume trade and movement of \npeople.  The  high  cost  and  low  level  of  reliability  of  interisland  shipping  services  are  a  major \nconstraint  in  the  transportation  of  consumer  goods  to  remote  and  often  poor  islands.  These \ncontribute to higher and more volatile prices for consumer goods in remote provinces. Improving \ninterisland connectivity means reducing the cost of interisland cargo transportation and making \ntransportation  more  reliable.  The  government  has  increased  the  number  of  pioneer  shipping \nservices and has started to upgrade the quality of ships servicing eastern Indonesia. \n \n19. \nNational  port  master  plan. The Shipping Law No. 17/2008 marks the start of reforms \nwith  the  long-term  objective of  developing  a  competitive shipping  industry  to support  domestic \nand  international  trade.  The  law  includes  a  provision  to  issue  a  national  port  master  plan  to \nguide  implementation  of  reform  and  port  investment  across  the  country,  including  eastern \nIndonesia.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  issued  Decree  No.  414/2013  which  serves  as  the  port \nnational master plan and will integrate development of economic corridors envisioned under the \nMP3EI and national transport and port systems. The master plan also includes port investment \nplans,  both  public  and  private,  and  also  covers  policies  to  support  improvements  in  port \noperation and efficiency.  \n \n\nInternational Connectivity Enhanced \n\n4. \n \n20. \nThese reforms aim to improve regulatory certainty in customs clearance and reduce ship \ndwelling time. The bulk of the country\u2019s international trade is facilitated by five main ports. The \nlargest is Tanjung Priok, the country\u2019s main international gateway in Jakarta, serving about 70% \n\n                                                \n13  World  Bank.  2012.  Investing  in  Indonesia\u2019s  Roads:  Improving  Efficiency  and  Closing  the  Financing  Gap. \n\nWashington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\fof internationally traded goods. Tanjung Priok also serves 29% of container traffic between Java \nand other islands. While Tanjung Priok is Indonesia\u2019s most efficient port, its productivity is much \nlower than that of major ports in Southeast Asia. Container dwelling time in Tanjung Priok was \n6.7 days  in  January  2012  compared  with  only  4.9  days  in  2010.  The  cost  of  delivering  one \ncontainer  from  Cikarang  (the  nearest  industrial  zone)  to  Tanjung  Priok  across  a  distance  of \nabout  56  kilometers  is  $750,  much  higher  than  the  cost  of  $450  across  a  similar  distance  in \nMalaysia (from Pasir Gudang to Tanjung Pelepas). The 2013 logistics performance index, which \nmeasures  the  efficiency  of  logistics  services  for  international  trade,  confirms  that  Indonesia\u2019s \nperformance  is  much  lower  than  that  of  neighboring  countries  due  to  lagging  infrastructure \nefficiency.  \n \n21. \nIndonesia National Single Window. Improving transparency in trade regulations is key \nto  facilitating  international  trade.  While  efforts  to  simplify  export  and  import  procedures  are \nongoing, the number of agencies and documents involved remains large. Thus, the INSW plays \nan important role in reducing the time and costs of importing and exporting by  enabling single \nsubmission,  single  processing,  and  single  approval  of  import  and  export  documents. \nDevelopment of the INSW was conducted in stages, and so far 15 agencies and six major ports, \nwhich  together  represent  about  80%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  international  trade  volume,  have \nimplemented the INSW. The  single  submission  and  sign-on  systems  are the final goals  of  the \nINSW.  With  those  features,  the  INSW  will  significantly  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  cargo \nclearance  process,  which  will  reduce  costs  for  exporters  and  importers  and  in  turn strengthen \nthe competitiveness in trade logistics. The government has incorporated the National Agency of \nDrug  and  Food  Control,  one  of  the  major  issuers  of  import  and  export  permits,  into  the  INSW \nsingle sign-on system. Under subprogram 2, two additional agencies, the Ministry of Trade and \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, have been added to the INSW single sign-on system. The function of \nthe INSW agency is still being performed by the Directorate General Customs. The government \nis in the process of developing a new institutional setup of the INSW, which is to be established \nin  2014.  To  reduce  the  dwelling  time  in  Tanjung  Priok  port,  the  government  has  started  the \noperation of Cikarang dry port. The expansion of the Tanjung Priok port is under way.  \n\n \n22. \nPost-program  partnership  framework.  The  program  recognizes  that  achieving  its \nintended  outcome  will  require  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy.  The  government\u2019s \nconnectivity reform agenda will continue beyond the completion of the triggers for subprogram 2 \nin  September  2013.  The  government  has  requested  that  ADB  remain  engaged  in  the \nconnectivity  reforms.  ADB  and  the  government  have  developed  a  nonbinding  post-program \npartnership  framework  to  enable  continuous  dialogue  and  to  guide  the  reform  agenda  from \n1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014. Under this framework, the government will continue its \nconnectivity  reform  by  focusing  on  making  KKPPI  operational, \nin \nimplementing  the  land  acquisition  regulations,  implementing  the  VGF  to  support  PPP  projects, \nestablishing a PPP unit within the Ministry of Finance, and establishing a new agency to run the \nINSW.  ADB  will  build  capacity  through  technical  assistance  for  Supporting  Inclusive  Growth \nthrough Better Connectivity.14 \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nimproving  capacity \n\n23. \nThe  loan  amount  is  based  on  the  strengths  of  the  policy  package,  its  development \nimpact, the importance of the sectors covered, indicative costs of reform, and the government\u2019s \nresulting \ninfrastructure \nthe \ndevelopment,  including  connectivity,  the  central  government  has  more  than  doubled  its \n\nfinancing  needs.  Recognizing \n\nimportance  of  accelerating \n\n                                                \n14  Attached to footnote 2 (TA 8215-INO). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure spending since 2010 (Table 1). Implementation of some policy reforms in this area \n(such as revitalizing KKPPI, implementing land acquisition regulations, and operationalizing the \nVGF and performance-based contracts) requires adjustment costs. Effective implementation of \nconnectivity  reforms  will  also  require  capacity  improvements  at  related  agencies.  The \ngovernment  has  increased  its  annual  budget  allocation  to  improve  transport  operations  and \nrelated infrastructure in eastern Indonesia. Despite the recent policy to reduce the fuel subsidy, \nthe government still needs to widen its 2013 budget deficit target from 1.6% of gross domestic \nproduct  to  2.4%  due  to  additional  infrastructure  spending  and  one-off  compensation  for  the \npoor. As a result, government\u2019s net financing need is expected to increase to about $22 billion. \nCurrently,  the  government  obtains  over  75%  of  its  financing  needs  from  market  sources.  The \nongoing  financial  market  turbulence  has  caused  government  bond  yields  to  increase \nsignificantly. The government has requested a total of $1.1 billion in policy-based lending from \ndevelopment  partners,  of  which  $400  million  is  from  ADB.  The  entire  process  of  the  policy \nbased-loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single tranche,  upon  satisfaction  of  the  core  policy  action  in \nthe policy matrix. \n \n\nTable 1: Government Financing Needs, 2010\u20132013 \n(Rp trillion) \n\n2012 Actual \n(unaudited) \n\n2013 Revised \nBudget \n\nItem \n\n2010 Actual \n\n2011 Actual \n1,211 \n1,295 \n884 \n125 \n118 \n(84) \n(1.1) \n131 \n149 \n(17.8) \n\nDomestic financing \nForeign financing \n\n995 \n1,042 \n697 \n98 \n80 \n(47) \n(0.7) \n92 \n96 \n(4.6) \n\n1,336 \n1,482 \n1,001 \n137 \n140 \n(146) \n(1.8) \n180 \n199 \n(19.2) \n\n1,502 \n1,726 \n1,197 \n203 \n188 \n(224) \n(2.4) \n224 \n241 \n(16.9) \n\nRevenues \nExpenditures \nCentral government, of which \nMaterial \n \nCapital \n \nSurplus/deficit \nDeficit (% of GDP) \nNet financing \n \n \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nTo  support  its  reform  initiatives,  the  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $400  million \n24. \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity \npremium  payable  to  ADB.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  exchange  cost \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  ineligible items  and  imports financed by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Indonesia  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines  on  simplifying  disbursement  requirements  for  program  loans. 15  Collaborative \ncofinancing will be provided by the World Bank ($300 million), the Government of Japan ($200 \nmillion), and the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement ($100 million).

The \nNational  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of \nTransport,  Ministry  of  Communication  and  Information,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Ministry  of \nTrade,  National  Land  Agency,  and  CMEA.  The  government  will  form  a  steering  committee, \nchaired  by  the  vice-minister  of  BAPPENAS,  with  senior  representatives  of  the  implementing \nagencies  and  development  partners  (ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank) as members. The committee will meet \nsemiannually  to  review  and  confirm  attainment  and  compliance  with  policy  actions  and  to \nprovide overall guidance on the implementation of the reform agenda under the program. The \ncommittee will work with the connectivity working group, which is also chaired by BAPPENAS \nand  responsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  connectivity  reform \nagenda under MP3EI.  \n\n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  policy  actions  of  the  program  are  derived  from  the  government\u2019s  medium-term \n26. \nreform  priorities,  which  are  crucial  in  achieving  the  government\u2019s  strategy  of  higher  and  more \ninclusive  growth.  Currently,  with  exports  still  slow  to  recover,  investment  will  need  to  play  a \nlarger role in supporting growth. The proposed reforms are expected to stimulate infrastructure \ninvestment,  which  could  generate  additional  economic  growth  of  up  to  one  percentage  point \nannually  over  the  medium  term.16 The  proposed  reforms  will  also  help  improve  the  quality  of \nemployment by increasing employment opportunities in the formal sector and reduce poverty in \nthe rural areas and in the eastern Indonesia, where poverty incidence is much higher. Improved \nconnectivity will also lead to improvement in access to and delivery of services in the rural areas \nand  in  the  eastern  Indonesia.  Combined,  these  will  help  reduce  inequality  over  the  medium \nterm.   \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\n27. \nThe government has made considerable progress in the legal and regulatory framework \nfor  public  financial  management.  Since  the  enactment  of  the  laws  on  state  finance,  state \ntreasury,  and  state  audit  in  2003\u20132004,  most  of  the  regulations  underpinning  the  laws  have \nbeen promulgated. In 2012, the number of government agencies that received unqualified audit \nopinion  from  the  External  Audit  Agency  increased  to  65%,  from  about  40%  in  2019.  ADB \nreinforces  this  momentum  with  continuing  support  to  improve  technical  capacity  and  controls. \nBuilding  on  previous  programs,  ADB  technical  assistance  for  Strengthening  National  Public \nProcurement  Processes has  been  committed to  boosting transparency  and  efficiency  in  public \nprocurement  processes.17 As  a  result  of  the  government\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  reduce \ncorruption,  the  capacity  of  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  has  improved  markedly. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with \nthe government.  \n \n\n                                                \n16 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB.  2010.

The program will also promote better connectivity for rural \nareas  and  eastern  Indonesia,  which  is  expected  to  help  expedite  poverty  reduction  in  these \nareas. 18 Impact  assessments  of  the  program  are  expected  to  demonstrate  the  productivity-\nboosting and poverty-reducing effects of connectivity reforms and development.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  classified  under \n\n29. \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe three main risks to the program, rated low to medium, are (i) weak coordination in \n30. \nand between key government agencies; (ii) continued under disbursement of capital spending; \nand  (iii)  a  rise  in  international  fuel  prices,  which  could  divert  government  budgetary  resources \nfrom capital investment to fuel subsidies. To mitigate risks (i) and (ii), the government has set up \na  high-level  task  force  for  connectivity  and  tasked  the  President\u2019s  delivery  unit  to  monitor  the \nprogress. For the third risk, the government has increased fuel prices by 44% for gasoline and \n22% for diesel in June 2013.19  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS  \n\n31. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the loan \ndocuments. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n32. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $400,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Inclusive  Growth \nthrough Improved Connectivity Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  for  a  term  of  15 years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n                                                \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 November 2013 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n \nBPS \n \n \n \nBPS \n\nAssumptions and \nRisksa \nAssumption \nMacroeconomic \nstability maintained \n\nRisk \nImplementation \ndelay due to \nregulatory and \npolitical processes \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nReduced transport \nand logistics costs  \n\nOutcome \nBetter developed \ndomestic and \ninternational \nconnectivity \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\n \nBy 2016: \nLower share of transport and \nlogistics costs in the total cost of \nproduction by 5% (2012 baseline: \n27%) \n \nPoverty rate in rural and eastern \nIndonesia decreasing more \nquickly (2012 baseline: 15.6% for \nrural poverty and 25.3% for \npoverty in Papua and Maluku) \n \n \nBy end 2013: \n \nIncreased share of public and \nprivate investments in the \ntransport sector (2012 baseline: \n17%) \n \nDwelling time in Tanjung Priok \nport reduced to under 6 days \n(2011 baseline: 6.7 days) \n \n\n \n\n \nBPS and report from the \ninvestment board \n \n \n \nBPS and other \nindependent surveys \n\nOutputs \n1.
