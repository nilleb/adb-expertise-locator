An  environmental \nimpact  assessment  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and posted on the ADB website on 26 September 2008.  \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  urban  road  infrastructure,  traffic \nmanagement  and  safety,  and  environmental  sanitation  in  the \nthe  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region \nfollowing  cities  of \n(Xinjiang):  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  Kuytun,  and  Turpan.  The  Project \nconsists  of  five  components  that  seek  to  improve  urban  living \nconditions  and  public  health,  and  protect  the  environment  by \nupgrading and extending roads and sanitation infrastructure in the \nproject cities. Based on specific transport conditions of the project \ncities,  the  Project  will  (i)  construct  37.4  kilometers  (km)  of  new \nroads  and  upgrade  70.5  km  of  existing  roads;  (ii)  install  traffic \nsignal  systems,  bus  stops  and  bays,  road  furniture  including  road \nbarriers,  pedestrian  crossings,  signage,  and  marking;  and  (iii) \nconstruct  and  install  environmental  sanitation  facilities  such  as \npublic  toilets,  garbage  collection  stations,  trash  cans,  as  well  as \nprovide solid waste management equipment.   \n \nADB  has  been  actively  supporting  the  PRC\u2019s  Western  Region \nDevelopment Strategy, which aims to spur economic development \nof the Western Region of the PRC including Xinjiang, by providing \ntechnical  assistance  and  financial  resources  to  improve  urban \ninfrastructure  (transportation,  communications,  power,  and  water \nresources)  and  support  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  main \npillars  of  the  strategy  are  investments  in  urban  infrastructure, \npreservation  of  the  environment,  and  attraction  of  private  sector \ninvestments in the region\u2019s economy. The Project will complement \nother ADB-financed projects aimed at improving infrastructure and \nenvironment in the region. \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nThe Project, which covers the fast growing cities of Altay, Changji, \nHami,  Kuytun,  and  Turpan,  is  designed  to  (i)  improve  the  urban \nroad  infrastructure  and  achieve  the  environmental  objectives \napproved in the city master plans and 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u2013\n2010, (ii) facilitate access to environmental sanitation facilities and \nenable their proper functioning, (iii) improve air quality and reduce \ndust pollution caused by poor surface road conditions, (iv) improve \nroad  safety  and  reduce  traffic  delay,  (v)  improve  environmental \nhygiene  and  public  health  through  the  construction  of  sanitation \ninfrastructure and provision of environmental sanitation equipment, \n(vi)  introduce  environmental  management  in  urban  downtown \nareas  and  expanding  urban  areas,  and  (vii)  catalyze  economic \ngrowth and improve poor people\u2019s well-being.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Urban Sector Strategy (1999), \nwhich  supports  investments  in  the  urban  sector  as  a  dynamic \nengine  of  economic  growth  and  employment  creation,  innovation, \nand  entrepreneurship.  The  Project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  to  strengthen  inclusive  growth, \nimprove  the  environment,  catalyze  investments,  and  improve \ngovernance.  The  Project  complements  the  ADB-financed  Xinjiang \nMunicipal  Infrastructure  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project, \nwhich  aims  to  improve  road  infrastructure  and  utility  services  in \nAlashankou  land  port,  Kanas  scenic  region,  and  Yining  City  of \nXinjiang. \n \nThe impact of the Project is sustainable socioeconomic growth and \nimproved living standards in five cities of Xinjiang.

The report \nis based on the results of the loan appraisal mission, as well as discussions with the central and \nlocal  governments  and  community  organizations.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. The problems and objectives tree analyses are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  PRC  economy  has  experienced  robust  economic  growth  during  the  last  decade. \nAnnual gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated from 10.1% in 2004 to 13.0% in 2007 \nand eased to 9.0% in 2008. GDP per capita in current market prices reached $3,308.1 in 2008.1 \nEconomic  growth  has  been  accompanied  by  rapid  urbanization,  with  the  country\u2019s  urban \npopulation reaching about 577 million. According to World Bank estimates, urbanization in the \nPRC can pass the 60% mark by 2020, with 200 million or more rural people joining the urban \npopulation.2 Growth  in  personal  incomes  has  resulted  in  increased  vehicle  ownership,  which \nwithin a 10-year period doubled to 28.12 vehicles per 1,000 people nationwide, and is likely to \ncontinue increasing rapidly in the future. Rapid growth in vehicles and passenger transport has \nput increasing pressure on the urban road network and environment.  \n \nRapid urbanization and industrialization have had a high environmental cost. Many cities \n4. \nface  environmental  threats  from  pollution.  The growing  urban  population,  industrialization,  and \neconomic  development  will  continue  to  increase  demand  for  infrastructure  services  such  as \nroads and associated environmental sanitation infrastructure, and call for increased investments \nin  urban  infrastructure,  transport  planning,  and  improved  road  and  traffic  management.  In  the \nPRC\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (11FYP)  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has  emphasized  inclusive \nand balanced economic development as a key strategic priority and has prioritized addressing \nenvironmental  protection  and  pollution  control  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased \ninvestment, and improved urban infrastructure management as pillars of sustainable economic \ngrowth. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nLocated  in  the  hinterland  of  the  Eurasian  continent,  Xinjiang  shares  borders  with  eight \ncountries and covers about 1.7 million square kilometers (km2), about one-sixth of the total area \nof the PRC. 3 In 2007, its population was about 20.5 million (about 1.5% of the population of the \nPRC), comprising 40% Han Chinese and 60% of other ethnic groups, the largest of which is the \nUygur. Xinjiang has lagged behind other regions of the PRC in terms of economic growth and \npoverty  reduction.  Despite  the  abundance  of  natural  resources,  Xinjiang  remains  one  of  the \n                                                 \n1  ADB estimates and ADB. 2008. Key Indicators for the Asia and Pacific 2008. Manila. \n2   World Bank. 2008. China Urbanizes. Washington, DC. \n3  Xinjiang  shares  borders  with  Afghanistan,  India,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Pakistan,  Russian \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nFederation, and Tajikistan. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\npoorest provinces of the country. In 2007, about 8% of its urban population and 12% of its rural \npopulation  lived  below  the  official  poverty  line,  compared  with  a  national  average  poverty \nincidence of 3.7% among the urban population and 2.3% among the rural population. In 2007, \nthe  per  capita  disposable  income  of  urban  households  in  Xinjiang  was  CNY8,871  ($1,267), \nwhich was the lowest of all the PRC provinces.4  \n \n6. \nTo  spur  economic  growth  of  the  Western  Region,  including  Xinjiang,  the  Government \nlaunched  the  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West  that  aims  to  stimulate  economic \ndevelopment  and  raise  the  living  standard  of  the  population.5 In  November  2008,  to  arrest  the \nongoing  economic  slowdown,  the  Government  launched  a  substantial  fiscal  stimulus  package \nequivalent to 16% of the 2007 nominal GDP that largely focused on infrastructure development.6 \nAs a result of the ongoing economic development, Xinjiang has experienced rapid urbanization. \nIn 2006, the urban population in Xinjiang at 7.78 million accounted for 38% of the population; it \nis  expected  to  increase  to  42%  by  2010  and  further  to  47%  by  2015.  The  increasing  urban \npopulation,  industrialization,  and  economic  development  will  continue  to  increase  the  demand \nfor  urban  infrastructure  services  such  as  roads  and  solid  waste  management.  From  1995  to \n2007, the length of paved roads in urban areas increased by about 68% from 2,403 km to 4,044 \nkm,  and  the  area  of  paved  roads  increased  by  150%  from  26  km2  to  65  km2.  Private  vehicle \nownership  in  Xinjiang  increased  from  14.9  to  35.0  vehicles  per  1,000 people  during  the  same \nperiod. The urban transport and road network are the main mode of transportation in the cities. \nRapid  growth  in  vehicles  and  passenger  transport  have  put  increasing  pressure  on  the  road \nnetwork and capacity expansion.  \n \n7. \nGrowing urbanization and passenger transportation have resulted in increased disposal \nof  waste,  including  solid  waste.  Uncollected  and  untreated  solid  waste  cause  significant \nenvironmental  threats  for  the  urban  areas.  In  2007,  about  2.78  million  tons  of  municipal  solid \nwaste  were  collected  and  disposed  of  in  the  region  but  only  51%  of  this  was  disposed  of  at \nsanitary landfill sites. Meanwhile, 655 million tons of wastewater were discharged, where 69% \ncame from municipal sources and 31% from industrial sources. For municipal wastewater, only \nabout 60% was collected and treated in the cities and towns in 2007. Considerable investments \nare  needed  to  construct  environmental  sanitation  facilities  such  as  public  toilets,  solid  waste \ncollection, and processing facilities. \n \n8. \nImprovement  of  the  urban  environment  in  the  cities  of  Xinjiang\u2014by  reducing  air  and \nnoise pollution, improving solid waste management, and strengthening environmental protection \nand  management\u2014is  crucial  to  achieving  and  sustaining  their  development  objectives.  An \nefficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable road network, together with improved sanitation \ninfrastructure,  is  important  to  raise  the  living  standards  of  the  poor  and  to  cope  with  the \nincreasing  demand  for  municipal  services  resulting  from  economic  growth  and  urbanization. \nTransport planning, improved road and traffic management, and vehicular emission control are \nkey  areas  in  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  ensure  sustainable  development  while  protecting  the \nenvironment.  Unlike  the  PRC\u2019s  coastal  cities,  where  rapid  growth  has  entailed  serious \nenvironmental problems, Xinjiang still has better opportunities to avoid negative environmental \nexternalities  of  rapid  economic  growth  and  achieve  sustainable  development  through  this \nProject and other future initiatives.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 2007.

The  main  pillars  of  the  Western  Region  Development  Strategy  are \n9. \ninvestments  in  urban  infrastructure,  preservation  of  the  environment,  and  attracting  private \nsector investments in the region\u2019s economy. ADB has been actively supporting the strategy by \nproviding  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  financial  resources  aimed  at  improving  urban \ninfrastructure  (transportation,  communications,  power,  and  water  resources)  and  supporting \ninclusive economic growth.7 The Project will complement other ADB-financed projects aimed at \nimproving infrastructure and the environment in the region.8  \n \nThe  Project,  which  covers  the  fast-growing  cities  of  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  Kuytun,  and \n10. \nTurpan, is designed to (i) improve the urban road infrastructure and achieve the environmental \nobjectives approved in the city master plans and 11FYP; (ii) facilitate access to environmental \nsanitation facilities and enable their proper functioning; (iii) improve air quality and reduce dust \npollution  caused  by  poor  surface  road  conditions;  (iv)  improve  the  safety  and  comfort  of  road \nusers,  including  pedestrians  and  drivers,  and  reduce  traffic  delay;  (v)  improve  environmental \nhygiene  and  public  health  through  the  provision  of  environmental  sanitation  equipment  and \nfacilities;  (vi)  introduce  environmental  management  in  urban  downtown  areas  and  expanding \nurban areas; and (vii) catalyze economic growth and improve poor people\u2019s well-being.  \n \n11. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy, which supports investments \nin  the  urban  sector,  as  a  dynamic  engine  of  economic  growth  and  employment  creation, \ninnovation, and entrepreneurship; and supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC \nto  strengthen  inclusive  growth,  improve  the  environment,  catalyze  investments,  and  improve \ngovernance. 9  The  proposed  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  provincial  urban  development \nmaster plan. The first ADB Project that follows the master plan is the ongoing Xinjiang Municipal \nInfrastructure  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project,  which  focuses  on  improving  the  road \ninfrastructure and utility services in Alashankou land port, Kansas scenic region, and Yining City \nof Xinjiang.10 \n \nPolicy  Dialogue.  The  Project  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  on  (i)  sustainable \n12. \neconomic  growth  and  environmental  management,  (ii)  integrated  urban  transport  planning, \n(iii) effective traffic management and road safety, (iv) institutional development of the Project\u2019s \nexecuting agency (EA) and implementing agencies (IAs), and (v) social and poverty aspects. \n \n13. \nThe  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  government  (XUARG)  recognizes  that  to \nachieve  long-term  sustainable  growth  there  is  a  need  to  balance  economic  development  and \nenvironmental  concerns.  The  Project  will  introduce  measures  to  prevent  and  control  pollution \n\n                                                 \n7    ADB.  2005.

To  date,  $6.1  million  have  been  disbursed,  77  contracts  have \nbeen tendered, and 44 contracts have been awarded.   \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fand  ensure  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  through  proper  environmental \nplanning, management, and public education. \n \n14. \nSustainable transport planning and policy reforms are crucial to ensure that the Project \ncreates  economic  value  added  and  the  benefits  are  passed  on  to  the  road  users.  Urban \ntransport  planning  must  take  into  consideration  the  linkages  among  land  use,  accessibility, \ntransport  services,  social  and  poverty  aspects,  road  accidents,  road  maintenance,  and \ninteragency coordination and cooperation. The master plan for each of the project cities is being \nupdated  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  growing  economy.  The  Xinjiang  and  the  project  city \ngovernments  recognize  that  integration  of  urban  and  transport  planning  is  important.  The \nProject  will  assist  local  city  authorities  in  strengthening  their  capacity  to  update  and  improve \nurban development and transport master planning. \n \n15. \nTraffic management issues include the increased number and severity of road accidents, \nconflict  between  pedestrians  and  motorists,  nonmotorized  transport  operations,  and  public \ntransport  efficiency.  Road  safety  problems  are  serious  in  the  PRC  and  are  mainly  caused  by \ninsufficient  road  network  and  inefficient  traffic  management.  Poor  traffic  management  also \ncauses  health,  environmental,  and  social  consequences  that  negatively  affect  national \neconomic  growth.  The  Project  will  introduce  an  appropriate  road  safety  strategy  in  the  project \ncities. This includes traffic engineering considerations in road design, focusing on existing major \naccident  black  spots,  traffic  management  focusing  on  signage  and  appropriate  use  of  traffic \nsignal  control  systems,  increasing  community  and  industry  awareness  in  road  safety,  and \ndissemination of road safety knowledge. Reduction of the frequency, severity, and cost of road \naccidents  will  particularly  benefit  low-income  people  including  pedestrians,  public  bus  users, \nand  bicycle  riders;  and  increase  the  economic  benefits  of  the  investment.  The  Project  will \nimprove  road  surfaces  and  introduce  traffic  management  measures  to  ensure  efficient  energy \nconsumption by vehicles and minimize pollution to the environment.  \n \nADB\u2019s  urban  infrastructure  projects  emphasize  the  importance  of  capacity  building  to \n16. \nenhance  organizational  capability  to  ensure  that  (i)  the  project  components  are  designed  and \nconstructed in a cost-effective manner and are implemented in compliance with environmental \nand social safeguards, (ii) operation and maintenance (O&M) procedures are in place to enable \nthe completed facilities to perform efficiently, (iii) adequate funding mechanism is established for \neffective O&M so that project benefits can be sustained in the long term, and (iv) there is overall \nenhancement  of  organizational  performance  in  the  delivery  of  municipal  and  environmental \nprotection services. Institutional development is an important part of the Project because (i) the \nproject  cities  have  no  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed  projects,  and  (ii)  the  Project \ninvolves  a  variety  of  works  in  geographically  dispersed  locations  involving  many  levels  of \npersonnel.   \n \nFrom  a  social  and  poverty  perspective,  policy  dialogue  is  necessary  in  a  number  of \n17. \nareas:  (i)  the  nature  of  demand-driven  urban  development  improvements;  (ii) approaches  to \nurban  development  that  are  pro-poor  and  sensitive  to  gender  and  ethnic  minorities;  and \n(iii) improvements  in  urban  infrastructure  and  landscapes.  These  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration  in  the  project  design.  Details  of  the  policy  dialogue  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \n \n18. \nExternal Assistance. Since 1992, ADB has provided more than 39 loans totaling nearly \n$4.9  billion  to  the  PRC  for  urban  infrastructure and  environmental  improvement  projects.  ADB \nhas also provided over $69 million for more than 100 TA studies to prepare these projects and \nto  review  and  study  key  issues  in  urban  infrastructure,  environmental  improvement,  and \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fpollution control. ADB is also providing a number of TA projects to the Government on Western \nRegion development to facilitate regional cooperation with Central Asia. External assistance to \nXinjiang for implementing its urban transport and environmental improvement projects has been \nprovided by the World Bank (Tarim Basin Water Conservancy and Agriculture Support, Kuytun \nto  Syimlake  Expressway,  and  Urumqi  Urban  Transportation  Improvement);  Government  of \nJapan  (Xinjiang  Cities  Integrated  Environment  Management,  Urumqi  Hetan  Road,  and  Yining \nCity Integrated Environment Management); Government of the Republic of Korea (Korla Outer \nRing  Road);  and  several  European  governments.  The  details  of  external  assistance  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n19. \nLessons  Learned.  Lessons  from  urban  transport  projects  financed  by  ADB  and  other \ninternational  financial  institutions  include  the  (i)  benefits  of  a  participatory  approach  and \nmultiagency coordination during project preparation; (ii) efficiently planned and well-coordinated \nresettlement  planning  preceded  by  adequate  consultation  with  affected  parties;  and \n(iii) importance  of  public  transport  and  traffic  management,  including  aspects  of  traffic \nforecasting, road safety, vehicle emission control, and road maintenance. These lessons have \nbeen considered in the project design. \n \n20. \nTo ensure timely implementation of the Project and to minimize delays caused by a short \nconstruction  season,  it  is  important  to  (i)  factor  in  a  shorter  construction  period  typical  for  the \nXinjiang climate; and (ii) undertake advanced actions within the frames of retroactive financing \nallowed  by  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  avoid \npotential  delays  in  the  project  procurement  process,  emphasis  needs  to  be  put  on  (i)  strict \nadherence  to  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii)  efficient  bid  evaluation  in  accordance \nwith ADB-approved evaluation criteria, and (iii) clear substantiation of bid evaluations.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nOutputs \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n21. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  socioeconomic  growth  and  improved  living \nstandards  in  five  cities  of  Xinjiang.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  road \ninfrastructure,  traffic  management,  and  environmental  sanitation  in  the cities of  Altay,  Changji, \nHami, Kuytun, and Turpan.   \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe  Project  has  five  physical  components:  (i)  Altay  Roads  and  Environmental \nImprovement,  (ii)  Changji  Roads  and  Environmental  Improvement,  (iii)  Hami  Roads  and \nEnvironmental \nImprovement,  and \n(v) Turpan  Roads  and  Environmental  Improvement.  Based  on  specific  transport  conditions  of \nthe  project  cities,  the  Project  will  (i)  construct  37.4  km  of  new  roads  and  upgrade  70.5  km  of \nexisting roads; (ii) install traffic signal system, bus stops and bays, and road furniture, including \nroad barriers, pedestrian crossings, signage, marking, and green separators; and (iii) construct \nand install environmental sanitation facilities such as public toilets, garbage collection stations, \ntrash cans, as well as provide street sweeper trucks.

Capacity \nbuilding  will  include  provision  of  (i)  project  management  consulting  services,  and  (ii)  training \nduring loan implementation. The training program will improve the knowledge and practical skills \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSpecial Features \n\nof  the  EA  and  IAs  to  conduct  (i)  infrastructure  project  design,  planning,  and  management; \n(ii) project  financing  and  financial  management,  including  financial  accounting,  reporting  and \nauditing,  and  project  capital  budgeting;  (iii)  traffic  planning  and  management,  including  public \ntransport and nonmotorized vehicles; and (iv) proactive environmental management and public \neducation.  \n \nC. \n \nProvision  of  Access  to  Environmental  Facilities.  The  Project  will  improve  urban \n24. \ntransport  infrastructure  and  help  cities  achieve  the  environmental  objectives  of  the  project  city \nmaster  plans  and  the  11FYP.  The  implementation  of  the  proposed  roadworks  will  facilitate \naccess to environmental facilities, including waste treatment plants and landfill sites. It will also \nallow  the  installation  and  connections  of  associated  underground  wastewater,  water  supply, \nheating, and gas pipelines for most parts of the project cities. Thus, the Project will improve and \nextend road accessibility and enable connection to environmental facilities. \n \nEnhancement  of  Essential  Road  Network. As part of the project cities\u2019 master plans, \n25. \nthe proposed road links will be constructed to meet the anticipated traffic demand and to resolve \npart  of  the  existing  traffic  problems  in  these  cities.  Most  of  the  traffic  problems  or  issues \nidentified  in  these  cities  are  related  to  traffic  engineering  and  road  safety.  The  Project  will \nprovide  capacity  building  in  areas  of  urban  transport  planning  and  development  control;  basic \ntraffic engineering and management techniques; implementation of road safety education; and \nauditing  throughout  the  Project  from  design,  implementation,  and  operation.  Enhancement  of \nthe essential road network will enable better management of city urban traffic by reducing traffic \ndelays  in  their  road  network,  improving  public  transport  services  in  terms  of  routing  efficiency \nand  journey  time,  and  comfort  of  road  users,  including  pedestrians  and  drivers.  This  is \nparticularly relevant to cities such as Altay, Hami, and Turpan, where tourism is one of the key \neconomic growth drivers. These fast-growing tourism areas are inhabited by a range of ethnic \nminorities, including the Hui, Kazakh, and Uygur, and will benefit from road improvements.     \n \n26. \nPromotion  of  Environmental  Protection  Awareness.  The  Project  will  improve \nenvironmental  hygiene  and  public  health  through  the  provision  of  environmental  sanitation \nequipment and facilities. Such facilities include 40 public toilets, 2,212 trash cans, 67 garbage \ncollection  stations,  and  street  cleaning  trucks  along  with  the  road  construction.  These  project \nfacilities will address the present inadequacy of sanitation infrastructure along the roads and will \nincrease the present level of hygiene as well as introduce environmental management principle \nin the project areas.    \n \n27. \nrequires  a  well-prepared  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  that  covers  environmental  management,  environmental  monitoring, \nand  institutional  enhancement.  The  plan  (i)  ensures  implementing  necessary  mitigation  and \nenvironmental  monitoring  measures;  and  (ii)  describes  the  actions  and  responsibility  of  each \nstakeholder involved in implementing the management plan, thereby increasing awareness on \nenvironmental  protection.  However,  a  well-prepared  plan  is  not  sufficient,  as  this  needs  to  be \ncomplemented  by  institutional  enhancement.  It  is  necessary  to  build  up  and  strengthen  the \ncapacity of the supervising agencies, project management offices (PMOs), and IAs so that their \ninstitutional  organization  and  responsibilities  are  well  defined  and  recognized  before \ncommencement of the Project. Institutional strengthening, capacity building, and training related \nto  environmental  sanitation  include  integrated  waste  management,  waste  minimization,  better \ndefinitions of waste quantities and compositions of waste, and establishment of clear roles and \nresponsibilities for managing solid waste.   \n\nSustainable  environmental  protection \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEnvironmental protection is not just the responsibility of the Government; the public also \n28. \nplays  an  important  part.  Environmental  protection  education  through  media  and  education \ninstitutes  is  an  effective  approach  to  help  achieve  project  objectives.  The  Project  will  initiate \npublic awareness and participation activities that will cover the full range of stakeholders, with \nspecial focus on women and children.   \n \nD. \n \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $187.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n29. \n$26.6  million.  The  total  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest,  and  other \ncharges during implementation.

The loan will cover civil works, equipment \nand  supplies,  project  management  consulting  services  and  training,  financial  charges  on  the \nloan during construction, and bank charges on the project imprest account. The Government will \nfinance  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs.  The  city \ngovernments of Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan through tax and nontax revenues will \nprovide  counterpart  funding,  for  which  they  have  provided  commitment  letters  to  XUARG  and \nADB.  \n \n31. \nA  financing  plan  for  the  Project  is  summarized  in  Table  3  and  the  details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plans for each component are in Appendix 4. A loan of $100.0 million \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\ffrom  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set \nforth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  reasons  for  its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n32. \nThe borrower of the loan is the PRC. The loan will be entirely made available to XUARG. \nDifferent  portions  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be made  available  to  concerned  city  governments. \nThe terms and conditions of such loan proceeds transferred within the government system will \nbe the same as those of the ADB loan.

A regional project PMO11 has \nbeen  established  under  the  PLG,  chaired  by  the  director  of  the  Xinjiang  Construction  Bureau. \nThe  PMO  members  include  officials  from  the  Xinjiang  Construction  Bureau,  Xinjiang  Finance \nBureau,  and  Xinjiang  Development  and  Reform  Commission.  The  PMO  will  undertake  day-to-\nday activities including interdepartmental coordination and liaison with the consulting team and \nADB  on  matters  relating  to  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  Details  of  the \nproject organization are in Appendix 6. Details of the institutional arrangement and assessment \nof the EA and IAs are in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n34. \nThe municipal government of each project city has established city PLGs and PMOs that \nare  responsible  for  (i)  project  implementation  in  the  respective  cities,  (ii)  liaison  with  the \n                                                 \n11 The  executing  agency  and  the  regional  PMO  are  the  same  as  for  the  ADB-financed  Loan  2420-PRC:  Xinjiang \n\nMunicipal Infrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project. See footnote 8. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nprovincial PMO, (iii) project financing, and (iv) overseeing the work of the IAs. The construction \nbureau in each project city will be responsible for project component construction and O&M of \nthe  project  facilities.  The  construction  bureaus  are  departments  of  the  municipal  governments \nand report to the heads of municipal governments.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n35. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  5  years  from  2009  to  2014.  The \nestimate  for  the  implementation  period  is  based  on  the  project  scope,  the  construction \ntechnology  requirements,  and  climate  conditions.  The  schedule  is  considered  realistic  and \nachievable  because  the  EA  (i)  has  experience  with  implementation  of  World  Bank-  and  ADB-\nfinanced projects, (ii) the project implementation structure is in place, and (iii) preparatory works \nare  under  way.  ADB\u2019s  prior  experience  with  similar  projects  in  the  PRC,  combined  with  the \nknowledge  and  experience  of  XUARG \ninfrastructure  and  environmental \nimprovement  projects,  indicates  that  the  schedule  is  realistic  and  achievable.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\nin  municipal \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\n \n36. \nGoods, works, and services financed under the loan will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Preliminary  contract  packages  have  been  formulated  in \nconsultation  with  the  IAs,  and  a  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  the  EA,  PMOs,  and  IAs \nhas been undertaken. Contracts for goods estimated to cost $1.0 million or more, and contracts \nfor  works  estimated  to  cost  $10.0  million  or  more  shall  be  procured  using  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  less \nthan  the  above  ICB  thresholds  but  more  than  $100,000  shall  be  procured  on  the  basis  of \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  tendering  and \nbidding  laws,  subject  to  modifications  agreed  with  ADB.  Contracts  for  goods  and  works \nestimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using shopping procedures. Prior review \nwill be applied for all ICB contracts, the first NCB contract for works and goods, and post review \nfor other procurement modes.  \n \nPreliminary contract packages have been formulated in consultation with the IAs and a \n37. \nprocurement capacity assessment of the EA, PMOs, and IAs has been undertaken. Based on \nthe assessment, it is recommended that prior review be applied for all ICB contracts and the first \nNCB contract for works and goods in each project city, together with the post review for other \nprocurement  modes.  A  procurement  plan  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  8.  Details  of  the \nprocurement  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F.  \n \nThe Project will provide funding for 17 person-months of international consulting services \n38. \nand  35  person-months  of  national consulting services  to  support  the  PMOs  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation  and  management  and  institutional  capacity  building.12 Consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited  in accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method.13 The Project will provide \nfunding  for  international  consulting  services  and  national  consulting  services  to  support  the \nXinjiang  and  city  PMOs  and  IAs  in  project  implementation  and  management  and  institutional \ncapacity building. XUARG has requested advance contracting for the recruitment of consultants. \n\n                                                 \n12 Consulting service inputs estimates are subject to revision based on results of detailed technical design. \n13 The quality- and cost-based selection procedure will be undertaken with the quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n\n\fThe consulting services will cover (i) support to the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs in project \npreparation and management, (ii) PPMS, (iii) transport planning and traffic control, (iv) financial \nmanagement,  (v)  social  development,  (vi) environmental  management,  (vii)  O&M,  and  (viii) \ninstitutional  strengthening.  Capacity  building  for  the  PMOs  and  IAs  will  be  achieved  through \nconsultant inputs, training courses provided by universities, specialized institutes and firms, in-\ncountry and/or overseas study visits, and acquisition of additional equipment financed from the \nloan. Outline terms of reference for project consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix \nG. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n39. \nTo expedite project implementation, XUARG has requested advance contracting for the \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  training,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works.  It  has  also \nrequested retroactive financing of eligible expenditures of up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of \nthe  ADB  loan).  Advance  contracting  will  include  (i)  preparation  of  tender  documents,  (ii) \nevaluation  of  bids,  and  (iii)  recruitment  of  consultants.  All  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The issuance of \ninvitations  to  bid  under  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  subject  to  ADB \napproval.  XUARG  has  been  informed  that  retroactive  financing  is  permitted  only  if  (i)  it  is \nspecifically  agreed  by  ADB  and  the  Borrower;  (ii)  the  goods,  works,  services,  and  consultants \nfor  which  it  is  requested  are  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  or \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants; and (iii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not \nexceed  20%  of  the  loan  amount.  The  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred  before \neffectiveness of the loan, but generally no earlier than 12 months before the signing date of the \nLoan Agreement. The Government, XUARG, and the IAs have also been advised that approval \nof advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n \n40. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  EA,  PMOs,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and will be included in the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  XUARG  has \nindicated  its  commitment  to  fight  corruption  and  a  number  of  anticorruption  actions  will  be \nincluded  as  covenants  in  the  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  Under  these  covenants,  XUARG \nwill  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ninvolve  the  agencies  responsible  for  oversight  of  each  IA  in  bidding  and \nconstruction to enhance construction quality control and supervise effective work;  \nintroduce  a  dual-signing  system  in  which  the  civil  works  contract  winner  also \nsigns an anticorruption contract with the employer;  \nperiodically  inspect  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and \nsettlements; and  \nengage a project management consultant to support the Xinjiang and city PMOs \nand  the  IAs  to  ensure  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency  in \nproject operations. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nloan  effectiveness  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable \n\n \n41. \nThe ADB loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of loan proceeds, XUARG will immediately establish an \nimprest  account  after \nto  ADB. \nDisbursement to the IAs from the imprest account will be based on the actual expenditures and \nsubmission of full supporting documentation to XUARG. Such documentation will demonstrate \nthat,  among  other  things,  the  goods  and/or  services  have  been  produced  in  or  from  ADB\u2019s \nmembers, and are eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest \naccount  will  not  exceed  the  Project\u2019s  estimated  implementation  expenditures  for  the  next \n6 months, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ADB statement of expenditures \nprocedure may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures.  Individual  payments  to  be \nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  procedure  will  not  exceed  $200,000.  The  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  will  be  used  only  at  XUARG  level  to  request  withdrawals  from  ADB. \nDirect  payment  procedures  may  be  used  for  large  civil  works  contracts.  Following  the \nrecommendation  of  the  financial  management  assessment  to  improve  the  internal  control \nsystem  of  the  IAs,  XUARG  will  review  and  approve  all  withdrawal  applications  prior  to \nsubmission to ADB.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n42. \nThe  Xinjiang  PMO  will  coordinate  with  the  city  PMOs  to  prepare  semiannual  progress \nreports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the period under review, steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  the  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress \nexpected in the next 6 months. The IAs will keep records to allow the identification of goods and \nservices  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  following  accounting  principles  and  practices \nprescribed by  the  accounting  laws  of  the  PRC.  This  law  requires  that  the  financial statements \nshall  generally  follow  recognized  accounting  standards.  The  IAs  will  set  up  and  maintain \nseparate  project  accounts  and  records.  The  financial  statements  of  project  accounts  and  the \nannual corporate financial statements for IAs will be subject to external audit by the audit bureau \nof the cities concerned, the XUARG audit bureau, and the state audit bureau. The audits will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  PRC  audit  regulations  and  must  meet  ADB  requirements.  A \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will \nbe  part  of  the  audit  reports.  The  IAs\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project \naccounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year \nthroughout the implementation period. XUARG and the IAs will submit reports and information \nto ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. \nThese reports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation, (ii) annual \nreports,  and  (iii)  a  project  completion  report  not  later  than  3  months  after  the  completion  of \nproject facilities. \n \n \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n43. \nThe PPMS indicators, their relevance, and monitoring practicalities have been discussed \nwith the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs during project preparation. The indicators are based on \nthe  monitoring  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  At  the  start  of  project \nimplementation, the Xinjiang and city PMOs and IAs, with the loan implementation consultant\u2019s \nassistance,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fthe inputs and outputs of the subcomponents, as well as the indicators to be used to measure \nthe project impact. The Xinjiang and city PMOs will (i) refine the PPMS; (ii) confirm achievable \ntargets;  (iii)  finalize  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements;  and  (iv)  establish  systems  and \nprocedures, no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n44. \nIn  addition  to  joint  project  reviews  carried  out  at  least once a  year,  ADB,  XUARG,  and \nthe  IAs  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  2  years  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation.  This  will \nimplementation \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy  reform  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed. \n \n\nthe  scope, \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nSocial  Aspects.  According  to  the  socioeconomic  survey  undertaken  during  project \n45. \npreparation, the urban poverty rate is 27% in Altay, 10.9% in Changji, 17.4% in Hami, 8.5% in \nKuytun, and 12% in Turpan. Average per capita incomes are CNY1,332 per annum ($0.52 per \nday)  in  Altay,  CNY1,493  ($0.58  per  day)  in  Changji,  CNY1,116  ($0.44  per  day)  in  Hami, \nCNY1,000 ($0.39 per day) in Kuytun, and CNY918 ($0.36 per day) in Turpan. The Project has a \nrange  of  benefits,  including  the  generation  of  employment  opportunities  directly  and  indirectly \nrelated  to  the  Project.  The  road  construction  and  upgrading  will  facilitate  greater  mobility, \naccess, and affordability for the local population to key basic services and destinations and will \nmake  urban  roads  safer  for  travel  thereby  reducing  traffic  accidents.  Measures  include \nconstruction  of  footpaths,  street  lighting,  controlled  pedestrian  crossings,  and  traffic  calming. \nEnvironmental improvements are associated with a greater emphasis on public hygiene through \nthe  provision  of  public  toilets  (and  bathrooms  in  one  city)  and  sustainable  solid  waste \nmanagement  practices.  The  Project  is  classified  a  targeted  intervention  for  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal (MDG) 7 Target 10. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 9.  \n \nThe roads to be upgraded for the Kuytun component will be on existing alignments and \n46. \nwill involve merely road surfacing. Although this component will also occupy a large amount of \nstate-owned  land,  the  land  is  not  fertile  and  no  people  will  be  affected.  Therefore,  no \nresettlement plan is required for the Kuytun component. Four full resettlement plans have been \nprepared  for  the  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  and  Turpan  components  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  endorsed  by  the  relevant  city  PMOs  and  uploaded  on \nthe ADB website. During project implementation, the resettlement plans will be updated based \non  detailed  engineering  design,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval  prior  to  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  To  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement;  close  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  committees,  and  affected  persons \nwere  undertaken  during  resettlement  plan  preparation.  The  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  and  Turpan \nPMOs  will  retain  the  services  of  a  domestic  external  monitor  every  6  months  to  (i)  review \nresettlement progress and the general welfare of those affected; (ii) recommend ways to resolve \nany  issues  or  problems;  and  (iii)  provide  advice  to  IAs  and  local  officials,  and  submit  such \nreports to ADB. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \nThe Project is classified category  A for indigenous peoples. To ensure that the Project \n47. \nwill  benefit  indigenous  people,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  has  been \ndeveloped for each project city. Xinjiang is predominantly an ethnic minority region of Western \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fPRC,  and  40.0%  of  its  population  is  Han.  The  major  ethnic  group  is  the  Uygur,  constituting \n45.9%  of  the  total  population.  Other  significant  ethnic  minority  groups  include  the  Kazakh \nconstituting 6.9% of the total population and the Hui constituting 4.4%. Of the five cities, Turpan \nhas the highest percentage of ethnic minorities (78%), followed by Altay (39%), Changji (28%), \nand Kuytun  (5%). The Project has been designed and reflected in the EMDPs for each of the \nfive cities and the social action plan to ensure that the specific social aspects of each of the five \ncities  are  incorporated  into  overall  project  design.  The  EMDPs  have  been  endorsed  by  the \nrelevant city PMOs and uploaded on the ADB website. The summary EMDP is in Appendix 11.  \n \n48. \nFinancial Aspects. The historical financial performance of the IAs has been analyzed to \ndetermine  whether  they  can  provide  the  required  counterpart  funds  during  the  construction \nperiod and necessary funds for O&M and debt service during the operating period. In addition, \nannual  average  growth  rates  of  revenues  and  expenditures  during  the  project  period  are \ncalculated.  All  IAs  operate  as  departments  of  their  respective  city  governments.  The \nconstruction  bureaus  are  financed  through  tax  and  nontax  revenues,  and  annual  operational \nbudgets are provided by the city governments. Annual forecast of debt service and O&M costs \nfor the Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan components were compared with the relevant \nannual  revenues  and  indicated  acceptable  fiscal  risk  since  it  is  expected  that  city  government \nrevenues  will  grow  in  line  with  economic  development,  providing  more  mobility  to  finance \nproposed  project  components,  and  central  budget  transfers  and  municipal  bond  issues  will \nprovide additional cushion to the provincial and city budgets.  \n \n49. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  of  XUARG  and  the  IAs  and  their  previous \nexperience  in  managing  investment  projects  financed  by  international  financial  institutions \nconfirms that the financial management systems and practices of the EA and IAs are adequate \nfor implementation of the Project.  \n \n50. \nThe  overall  financial  management  arrangements  of  the  IAs  are  generally  satisfactory \nand reliable. All IAs will establish and maintain separate project accounts and records, which will \nbe  audited  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  audit  regulations  and  meet  ADB  requirements.  A \nseparate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure will \nbe  part  of  the  audit  reports.  The  IAs\u2019  annual  audited  financial  statements  and  audited  project \naccounts  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  no  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year \nthroughout the implementation period. XUARG and the IAs will submit reports and information \nto ADB concerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and performance.   \n \nThe  Project  will  assist  each  of  the  IAs  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial \n51. \nmanagement  system  for  project  implementation.  A  capacity  building  component  to  strengthen \nfinancial  management  has  been  included  in  the  Project.  The  capacity  building  component  will \nstrengthen IAs\u2019 capacity in: (i) financial management, project finance, accounting, and business \nplanning;  and  (ii)  management  information  system  and  cost  management  and  control.  The \nfinancial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 12. \n \n52. \nEconomic  Aspects.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  covers  (i)  the  economic \nrationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, and (iii) the design of the \nplan. The economic rationale is sound as the Project will (i) support XUARG in promoting urban \ndevelopment of the cities in a more coordinated and cost-effective manner; and (ii) bring about \nmore sustainable investments in infrastructure, which aim to support inclusive economic growth \nand improve the quality of life. The economic analysis also evaluates the components relative to \nleast-cost  analysis  criteria  and  standard  benefit-cost  analysis.  The  results  of  the  economic \nanalysis  indicate  that  the  project  components  are  economically  viable  and  the  subproject \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fincrease \n\nincluding \n\nin  costs  and  decrease \n\ncomponents  stand  up  to  sensitivity  analyses  that  combined  variations  of  costs  increases  and \nbenefits decreases. A summary economic analysis is in Appendix 13. Under various sensitivity \nanalyses, \nin  benefits,  a  delay  of  project \nimplementation by 1 year does not have a significant impact on the base case economic internal \nrate of return. The overall economic internal rate of return under the base case is 19.7%, which \nis above the 12.0% economic opportunity cost of capital.   \n \n53. \nEnvironmental  Aspects.  The  Project  is  classified  environment  category  A.  Extensive \npublic consultations involving surveys, meetings with stakeholders, and focus group discussions \nwere  undertaken  during  project  preparation.  A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n(SEIA) has been prepared based on the domestic environmental impact assessments (EIAs). In \naddition,  a  peer  review  meeting  to  discuss  the  draft  SEIA  was  held  in  ADB  on  29  May  2008. \nComments from ADB have been incorporated in the final SEIA, which was prepared by XUARG. \nThe  SEIA  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on \n26 September 2008.  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  living  and  working  environment  of  residents  in  the  project \n54. \ncities. Construction of sanitation facilities will have environmental and public health benefits. The \nconstruction  of  public  toilets,  garbage  bins,  and  garbage  storage  and  transfer  stations  are \nimportant subcomponents to achieve these benefits. If sanitation facilities are not in place at the \nscheduled time, there would be adverse impacts on environmental and ecological resources in \nthe conservation areas. Health impact analysis is in Supplementary Analysis H.    \n \n55. \nThe  project  cities  and  the  hinterland  areas  presently  lack  adequate  road  networks  and \nconstruction of new roads will improve connectivity within them. Upgrading of existing dirt roads \nwill improve the currently dusty conditions during the dry season and muddy conditions during \nrainy  and  winter  seasons,  which  is  a  major  inconvenience  to  the  residents.  The  above \nroadworks  will  also  provide  opportunities  to  install  or  upgrade  municipal  services  such  as \npipelines,  cables  and  conduits  for  water  supply,  wastewater  collection,  power,  heating,  and \ntelecommunications  that  will  bring  environmental  and  social  benefits  to  the  population. \nImportantly, the Project provides an opportunity for XUARG to put in place sound environmental \nmanagement systems in fast growing cities and towns before economic development begins to \ntake off, and establish adequate institutional capacity to ensure environmental sustainability for \nfuture developments. \n \n56. \nDuring  the  construction  works,  dust  from  construction  sites,  noise  from  powered \nmechanical equipment, wastewater, solid wastes, and construction traffic are expected to be the \nmajor potential adverse impacts. Good project management and effective mitigation measures \nhave  been  identified  through  environmental  assessment  and  are  described  in  the  EMP.  With \nproper implementation of the EMP, the impacts will be mitigated to acceptable levels. The EMP \nalso  includes  institutional  strengthening  for  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  and \nundertaking of the monitoring requirements. The EMP will be further developed as the Project \nprogresses so that all mitigation requirements are met. \n \nProject  Risks  and  Mitigation  Measures.

From 1980 and \n1. \n2006,  the  urban  population  increased  from  190  million  to  577  million,  comprising  44%  of  the \nnational  population.  It  is  estimated  that  by  2015  the  urban  population  will  reach  50%  of  the \nnational population. By 2020, the PRC will have about 70\u2013100 cities with populations exceeding \n1  million  people,  which  will  account  for  about  30%  of  the  national  population.  The  11th  Five-\nYear  Plan  (11FYP)  2006\u20132010  recognizes  urbanization  as  one  of  the  vehicles  to  reduce  the \nurban\u2013rural income gap and alleviate poverty.1 Rapid economic development has impacted the \nenvironment  and  municipal  services,  and \nimplementation  of  coherent  and \ncomprehensive  urban  planning  and  management.  Investments  in  road  construction  prevailed \nover  investments  in  road  maintenance  and  traffic  management,  and  pedestrians  and \nnonmotorized  transport  have  been  marginalized,  posing  serious  safety  hazards  for  traffic \nparticipants.   \n \n2. \nGrowth  of  vehicle  ownership,  an  increase  in  road  accidents,  and  lack  of  parking \nmanagement  have  compounded  the  conditions  of  the  urban  transport  sector.  Without  prompt \nmitigation  measures  aimed  at  improving  urban  transport  management,  the  quality  of  life  and \nefficiency  of  urban  economies  could  be  hampered.  It  is  also  important  to  improve  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of \nto  undertake  urban  planning  and \nmanagement  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  urban  infrastructure.  Development  of  urban  public \ntransport systems and improvement of the environment were prioritized in the Prime Minister\u2019s \nReport on the Work of the Government for 2008.2  \n \nB. \n\nThe National Strategy for Development of the West \n\nlocal  government  agencies \n\nThe PRC\u2019s Western Region has not benefited as much as the coastal regions from rapid \n3. \neconomic  growth  and  reforms.  Urban  infrastructure  and  service  provision  cannot  match \nincreasing  demand\u2014thereby  hindering  investment,  degrading  the  environment,  and  limiting \ngrowth opportunities. In 1999, the Government launched the National Strategy for Development \nof  the  West  to  promote  balanced  growth,  stimulate  economic  development,  and  raise  living \nstandards  in  the  Western  Region.3 This  strategy  remains  a  key  thrust  for  the  11FYP,  which \nfocuses  on  improving  border  facilities,  strengthening  cooperation  and  trade  with  neighboring \ncountries, improving infrastructure, protecting the environment, and encouraging private sector \ninvestment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is actively supporting this initiative. \n \n4. \nXinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang),  located  in  the  northwest  PRC,  has \n46 ethnic minority groups that represent about 62% of its population. Sharing 5,600 kilometers \n(km) of frontier with eight countries, it is the gateway between the PRC and the Central Asian \nrepublics,  with  which  it  has  many  cultural  similarities  and  economic  complementarities.  Its \nhistory  and  ethnic  culture  have  promoted  tourism  development  and  its  rich  natural  resources \nprovide  a  sound  basis  for  development.  Considering  these  advantages,  to  maximize  potential \n\n                                                 \n1  The People's Congress of the PRC. 2006. 11th Five Year Program for National Economy and Social Development \n\nin the People's Republic of China.

The  lack  of  land  use  transportation  planning  has  led  to \npoor  provisions  in  infrastructure  and  environmental  protection  and  has  an  impact  on  the \ntransport  strategy,  public  transport  provisions,  and  road  safety  considerations  for  pedestrians, \ncyclists,  drivers,  and  passengers.  Poor  traffic  management  has  contributed  to  reduced \naccessibility and an increase in traffic accidents. \n \n6. \nThe  City  of  Changji  is  the  only  one  among  the  five  project  cities  that  has  conducted  a \ncomprehensive  land  use  transport  study  as  the  first  step  toward  the  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure  developments.  The  other  four  cities  (Altay,  Hami,  Kuytun,  and  Turpan)  have  not \nundertaken  any  comprehensive  land  use  transport  study  as  part  of  their  medium  and  longer-\nterm transport planning. The Project will offer an opportunity for these four cities to improve their \nplanning  techniques  as  part  of  the  planning  capacity  building  program.

However,  the  conditions  of  many  networks  are  not  satisfactory  and  suffer  from  the \nslow  pace  of  road  construction,  poor  maintenance,  and  inadequate  transport  infrastructure \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nplanning  and  management.  The  road  subcomponents  of  the  Project  will  fulfill  the  functional \nurban  transport  requirements  of  the  city  urban  areas.  Apart  from  improving  accessibility,  they \nwill  provide  an  opportunity  for  extension  of  municipal  services  to  the  existing  and  proposed \nurban infrastructure premises, thereby enhancing the urban living environment.  \n \n8. \nRoad  safety,  which  has  always  been  a  concern  in  the  urban  development  sector, \ninvolves  road  safety  education  for  different  groups  of  people  in  the  project  cities;  design  of \ntransport  facilities  with  road  safety  considerations  and  enforcement;  and  a  set  of  other \nmeasures aimed to increase road safety, accessibility, and efficiency. Therefore, improvement \nof road safety and traffic control has been identified as the prime concern in managing transport \ninfrastructure in the project cities. The 3-year traffic accident records (2005\u20132007) indicate that \nthe number of accidents in the project cities is high. The lack of road safety consideration in the \ndesign of transport infrastructure, general road safety education, and traffic safety enforcement \nare the main reasons for the high incidence of road accidents.  \n \nE. \n\nAir Quality and Vehicle Emission Control \n\n9. \nThe  ambient  air  quality  in  the  PRC\u2019s  cities  is  poor,  but  it  is  difficult  to  distinguish  the \ncontributing share to the pollution from local industries and vehicle emissions. The concentration \nof  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO2),  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2),  and  total  suspended  particle  level  particulate \nmatters10 (PM10) in the project cities complies with the class II air quality standards of the PRC.4 \nThe existing vehicular emission levels were monitored in the project cities and projected for the \nscenarios  with  the  proposed  road  improvements  as  part  of  the  environmental  assessment \nrequired by the city authorities. The assessment reveals that the concentrations of NO2 and CO \nfrom traffic emissions will comply with the class II Environment Air Quality Standards during the \nroad design horizon of 15 years.  \n \nF. \n\nPublic Transport and Nonmotorized Transport \n\n10. \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  internal  transport  connectivity  of  the  five  cities  and  at  the \nsame  time,  it  offers  the  opportunity  to  improve  and  extend  their  public  transport  services  to \nunderserved  or  poorly  served  urban  areas.  The  provision  of  public  transport  facilities  includes \nconstruction  and  installation  of  bus  bays/stops,  associated  pedestrian  crossing  facilities  along \nthe existing and newly constructed roads, and other facilities including bus terminal facilities at \nboth ends of the bus service routes.  \n \nIn  collaboration  with  the  city  transport  planning  authorities,  the  Project  will  (i)  increase \n11. \nthe  number  of  paved  roads  in  the  city  networks;  (ii)  optimize  the  number  of  public  transport \nroutes;  (iii)  improve  public  transport  forecasting,  planning,  and  management;  and  (iv)  increase \nthe number of bus stops/bays, as well bus terminal facilities. The above measures will improve \nthe quality and coverage of public transport systems in the project cities.  \n\n \n12. \nNonmotorized transport (NMT), mainly bicycles, is still a popular mode of transportation \nin  the  PRC.  Apart  from  Altay,  where  hilly  topography  prevails,  cycling  is  still  the  most  popular \nprivate  transport  for  the  other  four  project  cities  because  it  provides  door-to-door  service  for \nshort  and  medium  trips.  Therefore,  safety  and  separation  of  NMT  from  motorized  vehicles  on \nroads  is  an  important  part  of  the  road  safety  design  considerations  of  the  Project.  In  terms  of \ntraffic control at intersections, NMT should be given higher priority over other motorized vehicles. \n\n                                                 \n4  The  Ambient  Air  Quality  Standards  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (GB3095,  1996).  The  standards  are \n\ncategorized into five classes, class I being the best and class V being the worst. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe  road  subcomponents  under  the  Project  will  take  this  particular  road  safety  aspect  into \naccount. \n \nG. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\n13. \nThe  common  approach  to  road  maintenance  adopts  a  periodic  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation  program.  As  the  pavement  condition  deteriorates,  major  maintenance  work  is \nrequired,  but  because  of  maintenance  budget  constraints,  defects  have  to  be  addressed \nthrough a routine maintenance program that means further reductions in periodic maintenance \nand rehabilitation. Today, the existing road networks in the project cities are poorly maintained \nbecause  of  inefficient  management  of  the  road  maintenance  system  and  insufficient  financial, \ntechnical,  and  human  resources  allocated  for  road  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  The \nmunicipal  governments  have  failed  to  allocate  sufficient  budget  resources  to  finance  routine \nroad maintenance. Instead, maintenance is conducted on an ad hoc basis and financed through \nloans  from  local  banks.  To  meet  the  O&M  requirements,  the  Project  will  (i)  procure  road \nmaintenance equipment; (ii) provide capacity building on road maintenance systems to develop \nand  sustain  a  professional  and  efficient  approach  that  quantifies  the  long-term  maintenance \nrequirements;  and  (iii)  help  estimate  realistic  expenditures  for  maintaining  the  roads  in  the \nproject  cities.  Training  for  the  maintenance  staff  on  the  characteristics of  bituminous  materials \nunder extreme weather conditions and repair methods for various kinds of defects is important.  \n\n \n\nH. \n\nMunicipal Waste Collection Facilities \n\n14. \nThe completion of roadworks will enhance economic activities along the roads and lead \nto  more  pollution  loading,  such  as  wastewater  and  solid  waste.  While  other  international \nfinancial  institutions  are  financing  the  water  and  wastewater  sector,  this  Project  focuses  on \nproviding  public  toilet  and  municipal  waste  collection  and  transportation  equipment  for  O&M \nafter the completion of roadworks.  \n \n15. \nThe  project  cities  have  experienced  a  rapid  increase  in  municipal  waste  generation \nduring  the  last  decade  as  a  result  of  rapid  urbanization  and  economic  growth.  They  are  now \nfacing  multiple  problems  in  municipal  waste  collection  and  transportation.  The  equipment  for \nmunicipal  collection  and  transportation  is  insufficient.  There  is  lack  of  road  infrastructure  to \naccess the existing sanitation facilities, such as landfill sites. Moreover, none of the five project \ncities has snow removing trucks, which hampers the collection and transport of municipal waste \nduring  the  adverse  weather  in  winter.  The  Project  includes  road  components  to  improve \naccessibility  to  existing  sanitation  facilities  in  the  project  cities.  The  Project  will  provide  public \ntoilets and municipal waste collection and transportation equipment, such as garbage collection \nstations, garbage cans, garbage containers, garbage compaction vehicles, rear loader garbage \ntrucks,  and  grapple  garbage  trucks  along  the  newly  constructed  and  upgraded  existing  roads. \nSnow  removing  trucks  will  be  purchased  to  improve  road  conditions  and  facilitate  municipal \nwaste transportation during wintertime.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A3.1: Assistance Funded by ADB for

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and  Environmental  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through  improvements  in  urban \ntransport network connectivity and environmental conditions, promoting sustainable economic growth, and supporting institutional \nreforms in five of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\u2019s (Xinjiang) cities: Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan. Xinjiang is the \nlargest  region  (17%  of  total  area)  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  with  a  relatively  small  population  (20,500,000), \n60.39% of which belongs to ethnic minority groups (the Uygur is the largest, constituting 45% of this total). As the historic Silk Road \npasses through it, Xinjiang has a rich history and culture that is now serving as the base for development of the tourism industry in \nthe  Region.  Despite  these  assets,  it  remains  one  of  the  poorest  regions  in  the  PRC,  with  22  out  of  27  cities  and  68  counties \nclassified poor. In 2007, about 8.1% of Xinjiang\u2019s urban population lived on incomes below the official poverty line, compared with \nthe national average of 4.0%, with even higher rates of poverty for ethnic minorities living in the cities of Xinjiang. The Project is in \nline with the Government's strategy to develop the Western Region of the country, which seeks to reduce the economic and social \ndisparities  created  by  the  eastern  PRC\u2019s  rapid  economic  development  and  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development  vision  of \nxiaokang  (moderately  well-off,  articulated  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  [11FYP]  2006\u20132010),  aimed  at  maintaining  high  rates  of \ngrowth, but channeling it toward poverty reduction and reducing disparities. The Project supports ADB\u2019s PRC country partnership \nstrategy  priority  areas  of  (i)  strengthening  economic  and  social  inclusiveness  through  increasing  investment  in  the  urban \ndevelopment  of  small  cities,  (ii)  improving  the  physical  environment  of  small  cities,  and  (iii)  promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.b The Project will do the following: \n \n\n(i)  Create jobs and employment opportunities. It is anticipated that 3,396 full-time jobs during the construction period and \n8,114  follow-on  multiplier  effect  jobs  will  be  created.  Of  the  total  construction  jobs  created,  75%  will  be  for  unskilled \nworkers. The loan assurances specifically address employment of vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities, and women. \n(ii)  Improve living standards. Road construction will facilitate mobility, access, and affordability for local populations to key \nbasic  services  and  destinations.  It  will  also  make  urban  roads  safer  for  travel,  thereby  reducing  the  number  of  traffic \naccidents.  Measures  include  the  construction  of  footpaths,  street  lighting,  controlled  pedestrian  crossings,  and  traffic \ncalming  measures.  The  environmental  improvements  will  improve  health-related  issues  associated  with  a  greater \nemphasis on public hygiene through the provision of public toilets and bathrooms, sustainable solid waste management \npractices, and improvement in the general aesthetic appearance of urban areas. \n\n(iii)  Protect the environment. The environmental management plan (EMP) outlines clear actions for environmental protection \n\n(land, water, and archaeological sites) during construction, and these are accounted for in the loan assurances.  \n\n(iv) Focus  on  predominantly  ethnic  minority  areas. Xinjiang is predominantly an ethnic minority region. Of the five cities, \nTurpan has the highest percentage of ethnic minorities (78%), followed by Altay (39%), Hami (28%), Changji (22%), and \nKuytun  (5%).  Ethnic  minority  development  plans  (EMDPs)  have  been  formulated  for  each  of  the  project  cities.  These \nplans  ensure  mitigation  of  negative  impacts  and  attempt  to  maximize  participation  of  and  benefits  for  ethnic  minority \npopulations in the project cities.  \n\n(v)  Provide  skills  training. The Project  will include skills training (including language) to support job opportunities such as \noperation and maintenance of public toilets/bathrooms, construction, peri-urban agriculture and local tourism. Vulnerable \ngroups, ethnic minorities, and women are prioritized for this training in the loan assurances. \n\n(vi) Support  gender  inclusion.  Loan  assurances  will  ensure  the  participation  of  women  through  the  Project.  In  addition,  a \nGender and Development Fund grant proposal has been initiated to support the development of Turpan women\u2019s cultural \ntourism enterprises. This grant will also facilitate women\u2019s involvement in decision-making and development activities in \nTurpan. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (Millennium Development Goal 7, Target 10) \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Project is classified as targeted intervention\u2013Millennium Development Goal (goal 7, target 10). It will benefit 227,778 people in \nAltay, 403,218 in Changji, 418,918 in Hami, 302,089 in Kuytun, and 260,271 in Turpan. The urban poverty rate in Altay according \nto the project socioeconomic surveys is 27.0% (41.7% for ethnic minorities and 27.7% for single adult households), Changji 10.9% \n(13.3% for ethnic minorities and 10.5% for single adult households), Hami 17.4% (30.7% for ethnic minorities and 18.8% for single \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nadult households), Kuytun 8.5% (13.6% for ethnic minorities and 16.5% for single adult households), and Turpan 12% (19.6% for \nethnic minorities and 13% for single adult households). Average per capita incomes for poor households in Altay are CNY1,332 per \nannum  ($0.52  per  day),  Changji  CNY1,493  per  annum  ($0.58  per  day),  Hami  CNY1,116  per  annum  ($0.44  per  day),  Kuytun \nCNY1,000 per annum ($0.39 per day), and Turpan CNY918 ($0.36 per day). \n \nThe  causes  of  poverty  in  the  five  project  cities  vary.  In  Altay,  there  are  few  employment  or  other  income-generation  activities \noutside  the  public  sector  because  it  is  a  relatively  small  and  remote  city.  In  Changji  and  Hami,  while  a  significant  number  of \nhouseholds derive income from agricultural-based activities, unless they also derive a portion of their income from nonfarm income-\ngeneration  activities,  they  are  relatively  poor.  The  poorest  households  are  largely  urban-based,  with  no  options  for  livelihood \ndiversification. In Kuytun, the very poorest are those that have to rely on day wage-labor and are temporary workers in the oil fields. \nIn Turpan, the very poor are those households that do not have access to public sector employment and rely on seasonal tourism \nfor income generation. In all five project cities, the poor are typically less well-educated, are likely to fall ill more often, and have a \nhigher dependency ratio. All poor households surveyed by the Project have a small annual surplus of income over expenditure but \nthe  level  of  savings  is  very  low  and  other  assets  such  as  housing  are  lower  in  value  than  for  non-poor  households.  Poor \nhouseholds  cannot  easily  trade  their  way  out  of  poverty  either  because  they  lack  access  to  affordable  micro-finance  and  the \nmanagement skills and experience to develop and operate small businesses profitably. \n \nProject  benefits  for  poor  people  will  include  project-related  employment  and  expanded  employment  opportunities  as  a  result  of \nimprovements to urban transport infrastructure that will improve access to local employment opportunities and the ability to provide \na range of goods and services more readily to other consumers\u2014including tourists in Altay, Turpan, and Hami, oil and gas workers \nin Kuytun, and new  investors in Changji city\u2019s economic development. The household  survey and focus group  discussion  (FGD) \nrevealed  that  the  poor  are  more  likely  to  be  pedestrians,  have  own  forms  of  non-motorized  transport  (NMT),  and  benefit  from \nimproved  traffic  management  and  road  safety.  Personal  security,  especially  for  poor  women  and  children,  will  also  be  improved \nthrough the provision of street lighting. In Altay, the Project has been able to respond effectively to local demands, and culturally \nappropriate  toilets  and  bathrooms  will  be  constructed  for  communal  use.  Other  environmental  improvements  common  to  all  five \ncities will contribute to improvements in public hygiene that will benefit the poor.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe  design  has  been  highly  participatory  in  nature,  involving  detailed  consultations  with  affected  people\u2014including,  most \nimportantly,  vulnerable  people,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women\u2014in  an  attempt  to  reduce  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and maximize opportunities for positive benefits through design and implementation choices. Examples include the \ntime  spent  on  exploring  options  to  the  demolition  of  a  century-old  mosque  in  Hami,  avoiding  the  acquisition  of  arable  land  in \nChangji and Turpan, mitigating noise and safety risks in close proximity to educational facilities in Altay and Kuytun, and designing \nculturally  appropriate  community  shower  and  toilet  facilities  in  Altay.  Project  assurances  call  for  the  employment  of  local  labor, \nespecially  vulnerable  people,  ethnic  minorities,  and  women.  EMDPs  outline  strategies  for  mitigating  adverse  impacts  and \npromoting  positive  benefits  such  as  employment,  skills  training,  language  training,  and  cultural  understanding  training  for \ncontractors  and  workers.  An  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program  for  each  of  the  five  cities  has  been  included  not  just  as  a  reactive \napproach to the social risk but also as a proactive approach to empower workers.  \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nIndividual households living in close proximity to the roads  to be constructed or upgraded  will benefit directly from footpaths and \nstreet lighting. This intervention is strongly supported by the majority of people consulted during project design, especially women \nand  other  NMT  road  users,  because  it  improves  road  safety,  personal  security,  and  makes  movement  on  foot  more  convenient. \nThe construction of public toilets in downtown areas will benefit all people who frequent downtown areas for shopping, business, or \nrecreational  purposes.  Positioning  of  garbage  cans  at  strategic  intervals  in  downtown  areas  also  contributes  to  a  cleaner  and \ngreener environment, rendering each of the five cities better places to live in. FGDs confirmed that the residents of these five cities \nsupport the cleaning and greening of their individual city, although not at the expense of economic development. \n \nImpacts  on  Health  and  Safety.  Dust  generated  by  unsealed  roads  in  all  five  cities  is  considered  a  major  cause  of  respiratory \ndisorders  by  at  least  40%  of  the  population.  The  permanent  sealing  of  unsealed  roads  will  contribute  to  addressing  this  health \nissue.  Rerouting  of  heavy  traffic  will  result  in  lower  noise  levels,  especially  at  night  when  there  is  more  heavy  traffic  traveling \nthrough these cities, and will also result in lower exhaust emissions. Over 35% of the people surveyed in each city consider this to \nhave a significant impact on health. Improved public hygiene through better management of solid waste, including rubbish in areas \nwhere the public congregate will also be an outcome of the Project. Households in the project area consider themselves capable of \nmanaging household level hygiene issues but not broader public hygiene issues. Better roads  with improved traffic management \nand road safety measures will have a positive impact on the safety of road users, including the users of NMT, because there will be \na more rational and coordinated approach to multimodal forms of transport. Keeping heavy trucks out of residential and downtown \nareas is a very positive safety impact.  \n \nAffordability.  This is not an issue in this Project, except for the use of public bathrooms in Altay because the Project will not be \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nproviding access to public utilities. In Altay, potential beneficiaries have all agreed they are able and willing to pay for the use of the \nproposed  bathrooms  because  they  cannot  afford  the  same  in  their  own  houses.  Local  people  will  be  hired  by  the  city  as \nmaintenance workers for this new community infrastructure.  \n \nImpacts  on  Employment.  About  3,396  full-time  jobs  (1,683  in  Altay,  1,278  in  Changji,  105  in  Hami,  130  in  Kuytun,  and  200  in \nTurpan)  will  be  created  over  the  construction  period  and  follow-on  multiplier  effects  are  expected  to  create  8,114  full-time  jobs \n(220 in  Altay,  5,584  in  Changji,  90  in  Hami,  270  in  Kuytun,  and  1,950  in  Turpan).  This  translates  into  CNY72,215,500 \n(CNY38,539,000  in  Altay,  CNY24,733,600  in  Changji,  CNY1,132,900  in  Hami,  CNY2,842,000  in  Kuytun,  and  CNY4,968,000  in \nTurpan)  of  costs  returned  to  the  northern  and  central  Xinjiang  economy.  Loan  assurances  will  ensure  that  vulnerable,  ethnic \nminorities, and women are beneficiaries of employment (during construction and operation) opportunities. \n \nThe EMDPs ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equitably from the Project and that any negative impacts affecting them will be \nreduced  or  mitigated.  Provisions  to  enhance  the  economic  conditions  of  ethnic  minorities  have  been  integrated  into  the  project \ndesign and project assurances. Compensation and livelihood restoration measures are included in the resettlement plans to ensure \nthat ethnic minority households affected by land acquisition benefit equally from the Project.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. During the project preparatory technical assistance, several participatory approaches were used to solicit inputs from a range of \nstakeholders in the project cities. A socioeconomic survey at the household level covered 806 households and information relating \nto 2,874 people. Thirty FGDs involving an average of 18 persons per FGD or a total of 540 people were also held. In Hami, where \nthe  mosque  was  slated  to  be  demolished  based  on  the  preliminary  alignment  of  the  road  improvement,  additional  public \nconsultations  were  held  involving  the  Imam  of  the  mosque,  mosque  attendees,  local  traders,  merchants  and  shopkeepers,  the \nIslamic  Association,  community  residential  centers,  and  independent  experts  both  in  Hami  and  Urumqi.  Four  separate  visits  and \nthree  rounds  of  consultations  involving  over  500  people  were  made  to  clarify  this  sensitive  issue  and  a  detailed  narrative  of  the \ndiscussions and records of those participating in the consultations has been documented. Key informant interviews were also held \nwith  bureaus  and  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation  to  inform  the  project  design.  For  the  resettlement  plans,  separate \nsocioeconomic surveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and specific impact studies of 3,439 affected people were involved. \nDevelopment of the environmental impact assessments and EMP involved two rounds of public consultations. EMDPs have been \nprepared collaboratively and discussed with the communities. The resettlement plans, EMDPs, and EMP set out detailed ongoing \npublic participation plans.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing        \n\n Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?  Yes    \nPublic disclosure of all project documents  will be made at the project management office in both Urumqi and each of the project \noffices in the five cities, including appropriate ethnic minority languages on the Asian Development Bank website. This includes the \nproject  information  document,  design  and  monitoring  framework,  EMDPs,  resettlement  plans,  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment, report and recommendation of the President, public sector legal agreement, project administration memorandum, and \nsocial  and  environmental  monitoring  reports.  A  project  information  document  will  be  prepared  for  each  project  city.  Booklets \noutlining the resettlement plans will be distributed to the affected households and disclosure meetings will be held. Copies of the \nbooklet will be available for project management offices, and each affected community residential association office. Each project \ninformation document (available in Chinese and local languages) will contain (i) a map of the affected areas; (ii) description of the \nProject,  its  aims,  and  subcomponents;  (iii)  details  of  the  works;  (iv)  a  timetable  of  the  project  activities,  including  estimated \ncommencement  and  completion  dates;  (v)  expected  social,  economic,  and  environmental  impacts;  (vi)  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; (vii) the compensation policy and entitlements; (viii) an outline of livelihood restoration measures; (ix) the workings of \nthe  compensation  committee  and  grievance  redress  committee;  (x)  an  outline  of  how  consultation  and  participation  with \nresettlement plans and communities will continue; and (xi) the project communications strategy, including how people can find out \nwhat  business  opportunities  may  arise  in  conjunction  with  the  Project  and  where  people  can  get  further  information  about  the \nProject. Resettlement plans and EMDPs indicate how consultation will continue through implementation.  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nAside  from  the  economic  and  employment  impacts,  the  social  impacts  of  the  Project  are  clearly  gender  based.  Upgrading  and \nconstructing new footpaths with street lighting, controlled pedestrian crossings, and traffic calming measures are interventions that \nwomen in each of the five project cities strongly support. They also support measures to improve public hygiene associated with \nrubbish collection and for poorer women without access to indoor toilets or bathrooms, the complementary measures proposed are \nmeasures the women themselves proposed. Women anticipate benefits such as an improved living environment, increased road \nsafety  and  personal  security,  new  employment  opportunities,  reduced  time  burdens,  and  reduced  incidence  of  preventable \ndiseases. \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nProject assurances prioritize women, especially poor and ethnic minority women, for employment and skills training and ensure \nmonitoring of their involvement. The proposed Gender and Development Fund grant project in Turpan focuses on providing training \nand opportunities to enter into cultural tourism for ethnic minority women in the city.  \n\nIssue \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \nSignificant \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n  Full Plan \n  Short Plan \n   Resettlement Framework \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAltay, Changji, Hami, and Turpan \nresettlement plans have been \nprepared in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s own regulations and \nthose of the Asian Development Bank, \nand disclosed to the affected people \nand the public. Internal and external \nmonitoring arrangements will be put in \nplace. \nThe project areas are majority ethnic \nareas and project land acquisition \naffects ethnic minorities to a greater \ndegree than the general population. \nThe EMDPs have been prepared for \nall five project cities. Ethnic minority \nissues and assistance has been \nincluded in the resettlement plans. The \nEMDPs further mitigate any negative \nimpacts of the Project and attempt to \nmaximize the positive benefits through \ntraining and other activities.

All of the five city components \ninclude construction and installation of environmental sanitation facilities and accessories.  \n \n2. \nThe Altay component includes the subcomponent to construct and upgrade 19 roads (total \nroad  length  is  28.02  kilometers  [km])  and  5  bridges  with  a  total  length  of  281  meters  (m). \nAdditionally,  there  will  be  construction  of  footpaths,  street  lighting,  and  other  traffic  calming \nsolutions. The environmental sanitation subcomponent includes 10 public toilets and bathhouses, \n654  garbage  bins,  102  refuse  collection  points,  and  20  garbage  collection  stations.  A  range  of \nvehicles will be purchased to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean streets, and clear \nsnow. \n \n3. \nThe Changji component includes the subcomponent to construct/upgrade 8 main roads and \n1  secondary  road  (total  road  length  is  23.24  km),  the  32  m-long  South  Park  Road  bridge,  and \nmaintenance  facilities.  The  environmental  sanitation  subcomponent  involves  the  procurement  of \n8 public toilets, 394 garbage bins, and 33 refuse collection points; and a variety of vehicles will be \npurchased to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean streets, and clear snow. \n \n4. \nThe Hami component includes the subcomponent to construct/upgrade 3 main roads (total \nroad length is 9.02 km) and the environmental sanitation subcomponent involves the procurement \nof 182 garbage cans in addition to 2 street cleaning machines. \n \nThe  Kuytun  component  includes  the  subcomponent  to  construct/upgrade  13  municipal \n5. \nroads (total length of 23.6 km) including 2 trunk roads, 2 sub-trunk roads, and 9 branch roads. The \nenvironmental  sanitation  subcomponent  includes  11  public  toilets,  26  refuse  collection  points, \n480 garbage bins, and a variety of vehicles to collect and dispose of solid waste materials, clean \nstreets, and clear snow. \n \n6. \nThe  Turpan  component  includes  the  subcomponent  to  construct/upgrade  14  municipal \nroads  (total  length  is  22.76  km)  including  5  trunk  roads,  7  sub-trunk  roads,  2  branch  roads,  and \nconstruct 2 10-m culverts. The environmental subcomponent includes 11 public toilets, 26 refuse \ncollection  points,  502  garbage  bins,  130  garbage  containers,  and  a  variety  of  vehicles  to  collect \nand dispose of solid waste materials and clean streets. \n \nBased on the feasibility study report, the Altay, Changji, Hami, and Turpan components will \n7. \nnecessitate large amounts of land acquisition and resettlement. The roads to be upgraded in the \nKuytun component will be on existing alignments and will just involve road surfacing. Although this \ncomponent  will  also  occupy  a  large  amount  of  state-owned  land,  the  land  is  non-fertile  and  no \npeople will be affected. Therefore, no resettlement plan will be required for the Kuytun component. \nFour  full  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  Altay,  Changji,  Hami,  and  Turpan \ncomponents  in  compliance  with  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  During  project  implementation,  the  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated \nbased  on  detailed  engineering  design,  disclosed  to  affected  persons,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval prior to award of civil works contracts. \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResettlement Impacts \n\nB. \n \n8. \nTo  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  close  consultations  with  local \nofficials, village committees, and affected persons have been undertaken during resettlement plan \npreparation.  \n \n9. \nThe  Project  will  affect  28  subdistricts/villages/townships/neighborhoods  in  Altay,  Changji, \nHami,  and  Turpan.  Land  acquisition  and/or  house  demolition  will  directly  affect  3,921  persons\u2014\n1,475  persons  (369  households)  from  land  acquisition;  1,719  persons  (449  households)  from \nhousehold  demolition;  170  persons  (45  households)  from  both  land  acquisition  and  house \ndemolition; 160 persons from 10 small business shops (9 shops and 1 market); and 397 persons \nfrom 26 enterprises and institutions. About 0.354 square kilometers (km2) of stated-owned land will \nbe  permanently  occupied,  0.724  km2  of  collective  land  will  be  acquired  and  about  0.088  km2  of \nresidential housing will be demolished. The details are summarized in Table A10. \n \n\nTable A10: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts of the Project \n\n \n \n \n \n \nComponent \n\n \n \nAffected \nTownship/ \nCommunity/ \nVillages \n\nPermanent  \nCollective \nLand \nAcquisition\n(m2) \n\nPermanent \nStated-\nOwned \nLand \nOccupation\n(m2) \n\nTemporary \nLand \nAcquisition\n(m2) \n\nHouseholds/ \nShops/ \nEnterprises \n(m2) \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSite \nAltay \nCity \n \n \nChangji \nCity \n \n \nHami \nCity \n \n \nTurpan \nCity \n \n \n\n3/ \n\n3/ \n1 \n\n2/ \n\n0/ \n8 \n\n1/ \n\n3/ \n3 \n\n2/ \n\n0/ \n5 \n \n \n8/6/17 \n\n7,687 \n \n \n\n474,382 \n \n \n\n48,047 \n \n \n\n194,148 \n \n \n\n21,393 \n \n \n\n107,874 \n \n \n\n160,47 \n \n \n\n208,288 \n \n \n\n0 \n \n \n\n0 \n \n \n\n0 \n \n \n\n0 \n \n \n\n \n \n \nDirectly \nAffected \nPersons \n\n346\n\n1,511\n\n450\n\n1,614\n\n13,187/ \n87/ \n2,890 \n\n22,123/ \n2,214/ \n11,293 \n\n20,445/ \n0/ \n2,581 \n\n32,211/ \n883/ \n100 \n87,966/ \n3,184/ \n16,864 \n\n0 \n\n3,921\n\n353,602 \n\n724,264 \n\nPolicy and Legal Framework \n\nTotal \nm2= square meter \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC. \n \nThe  resettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Land  Administration \n10. \nLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2004, relevant regulations of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous \nRegion,  and  ADB\u2019s \nlocal \ngovernments  and  affected  persons  and  general  practices  in  the  project  area,  the  implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  adopted  a  set  of  resettlement  principles,  and  an  entitlement  matrix  has  been \nprepared for the Project. Compensation for land acquisition, residential housing, and nonresidential \nbuildings (shops and enterprises) will be paid to all users whether titled or not. For land acquisition, \ncompensation fees include land compensation, resettlement subsidy, and compensation for crops \nand  trees.  The  land  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  villages/affected  persons  and  the \n\nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy.  Based  on  consultations  with \n\nAltay \n \n \n\nChangji \n \n \n\nHami \n \n \n\nTurpan \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nResettlement and Rehabilitation \n\nresettlement  subsidy  to  the  affected  persons.  The  land  acquisition  compensation  is  rated  at  the \nland\u2019s  average  annual  output  value.  For  business  shop  and  house  demolition,  compensation  will \nbe paid to owners for rehabilitation of the affected persons. The compensation payments will be in \ncash  according  to  the  appraised  value  of  the  land  and  fixed  property  assets.  Compensation  for \ncrops,  trees,  other  facilities,  and  temporary  impacts  will  be  paid  directly  to  affected  persons. \nIncome  losses  resulting  from  reduced  production/sales  and  wages  caused  by  the  Project  will  be \nassessed and compensated in cash. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nTo minimize the resettlement impacts to affected persons and restore their living standards, \ndetailed  programs  of  restoration  and  relocation  have  been  arranged  in  each  resettlement  plan. \nPeople  can  choose  the  available  programs  according  to  their  requirements.  Based  on  the \neconomic  characteristics  of  affected  villages,  different  schemes  for  income  restoration  will  be \ncarried out.  \n \n12. \nSince  the  resettlement  impacts  differ  among  the  four  components,  the  emphasis  varies \naccording  to  the  component.  Most  of  the  land  acquisition  will  occur  in  Changji  and  most  of  the \nhouse demolition, including a market demolition, will take place in Turpan. In Altay and Hami there \nis not only land acquisition but also house demolition, and compared with Changji and Turpan the \nimpacts are less significant. \n  \n13. \nSome common strategies and measures will be taken in each city for the affected persons \nand villages, including low-yield land improvement and livestock raising. Assistance measures like \nthe  provision  of  employment  in  project  construction,  provision  of  skills  training,  and  employment \ninformation  will  be  provided  to  all  affected  persons  (at  least  50%  of  whom  are  women).  In  Hami \nand Altay, the affected persons who lose all their land can take urban minimum living security. For \nfamilies  that  lose  part  of  their  land,  the  land  loser  is  identified  by  the  average  area  of  land \nacquisition and entered into urban minimum living security. The fund will be operated according to \nthe minimum living support scheme, the calculation, and the amount of land acquisition. Through \nthese  measures,  it  is  envisaged  that  all  affected  persons  can  maintain  or  acquire  more  stable \nincomes to restore and enhance their living standards.  \n \n14. \nRegarding  residential  housing  demolition,  irrespective  of  whether  it  is  urban  or  rural,  the \naffected  households  will  receive  compensation  at  replacement  costs  for  the  lost  structures  and \nattachments  without  depreciation  after  property  assessment.  Urban  households  also  have \ncompensation  for  residential  state-owned  land  after  real  estate  assessment.  Salvage  of  the \nstructural  materials  will  be  allowed  and  a  relocation  subsidy  will  be  provided.  With  the \ncompensation  money,  the  rural  affected  households  can  rebuild  their  houses  by  themselves  with \nfree  homestead  provided  according  to  their  wishes  or  purchase  economically  affordable  housing \nand  resettlement  houses.  There  are  low-rental  houses,  especially  for  low-income  households,  in \nwhich they can live on a long-term basis. In the project cities that have more ethnic minorities (like \nHami  City  and  Turpan  City),  there  are  several  types  of  resettlement  houses  such  as  apartment \nbuildings and one-story houses with a yard. The resettlement plan, in conjunction with the ethnic \nminority  development  plan,  will  ensure  that  ethnic  minorities  are  offered  houses  consistent  with \ntheir cultural preferences.  \n \n15. \nFor  nonresidential  buildings  and  structures  (small  business  shops  and  enterprises),  the \naffected  owners  will  be  compensated  with  cash  at  replacement  costs  for  the  lost  structures.  The \naffected shops and enterprises can be either moved back and rebuilt on the existing backyard of \nshops  along  upgraded  roads  or  built  on  free  sites  provided  by  the  project  management  office \n(PMO),  depending  on  the  practicality  of  moving  back  and  their  preference.  In  addition,  special \nattention will be paid to vulnerable groups for their resettlement and rehabilitation, who will receive \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nResettlement Cost and Fund Management \n\nInformation Disclosure, Participation, and Grievances \n\nadditional assistance: (i) set-up of special supporting funds in each component, and (ii) provision of \npotential employment opportunities and skills training. \n \nE. \n \nThe  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  four  components  is \n16. \nCNY192.8849 million in latter half 2007 prices, including contingencies and land taxes, equivalent \nto $28.16 million.1 The city PMOs will fund land acquisition and resettlement costs, included as part \nof  the  total  project  cost.  According  to  the  compensation  policies  and  standards  defined  in  the \nresettlement  plans,  the  payment  and  usage  of  compensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the \nsupervision  of  internal  monitoring  agencies,  with  regular  audit  review  and  regular  review  by  the \nexternal monitoring agency. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in the villages, small \nshops,  and  enterprises.  The  compensation  contracts  will  be  negotiated  and  signed  with  village \ncommittees,  households,  small  business  shops,  and  enterprises.  On  this  basis,  the  final  costs \nmight be adjusted. \n \nF. \n \n17. \nThe affected persons have been informed about the key elements of land acquisition and \nresettlement  through  consultation  during  the  planning  stage  and  information  disclosure  sessions \nwith the affected persons, villages, and county governments during the project preparation stage. \nDuring  meetings,  interviews,  focus  group  discussions,  public  consultation  workshops,  and \ncommunity  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the  planning  and  their \nconcerns  were  integrated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  information  booklet\u2014\nconfirming  the  project  affected  areas,  implementation  schedule  and  framework,  compensation \nstandards  for  land  acquisition  and  other  assets,  relocation  assistance,  livelihood  rehabilitation \nstrategy,  and  dispute  resolution  procedures\u2014was  distributed  to  affected  persons  at  the  end  of \nJune  2008.  Draft  resettlement  plans  were  distributed  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  counties, \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \ntownships,  villages,  and  affected  persons \nCommunications Policy (2005), the final resettlement plans were posted on the ADB website prior \nto  appraisal.  The  PMO  will  set  up  project  resettlement  agencies  to  supervise  implementation, \ncontinue public consultations, monitor progress, and deal with grievances. \n \nG. \n \n18. \nXinjiang  PMO  and  city  PMOs  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  implementation  of \nresettlement.  Each  city/area  PMO  coordinates  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting of land acquisition and resettlement. The IAs are Altay Construction Bureau for the Altay \ncomponent, Changji Urban and Rural Construction Commission for the Changji component, Hami \nConstruction  Bureau  for  the  Hami  component,  and  Turpan  Construction  Bureau  for  the  Turpan \ncomponent.  IAs  will  take  primary  responsibility  for  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation, \nand  timely  delivery  of  entitlements.  To  ensure  smooth  implementation,  staff  in  charge  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  will  undertake  relevant  training  on  resettlement  implementation \norganized  by  Xinjiang  PMO.  The  resettlement  implementation  schedule  for  four  components  has \nbeen  prepared.  No  land  acquisition  or  demolition  shall  start  until  resettlement  plans  are  updated \nbased on detailed designs and approved by ADB. It is anticipated that land acquisition and house \ndemolition will start in 2009 and be completed by the end of 2013. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangement and Schedule \n\nin  July. \n\n                                                 \n1 Exchange rate: $1 = CNY6.85. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nH. \n \n19. \nInternal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be conducted. Each city \nPMO will carry out internal supervision and monitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of \nthe resettlement plan. Xinjiang PMO and the city/area PMOs will engage an independent agency \nfor  semiannual  monitoring  and  annual  evaluation  for  four  components  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  until  2  years  after  the  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The \nindependent  agency  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  resettlement  implementation, \npayment, and dispute resolution. It will identify the impacts for affected persons on (i) whether they \nhave  received  the  approved  compensation  and  entitlements  on  time,  and  (ii)  whether  their  living \nstandard  and  income  level  have  been  restored  to  pre-project  status.  A  baseline  survey  will  be \ncarried out before land acquisition and house demolition starts. External monitoring reports will be \nforwarded directly to the PMO and ADB. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n\nIntroduction \n\nProject Descriptions \n\nSocioeconomic Profiles \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Altay  City,  Changji  City,  Hami  City,  Kuytun  City,  and  Turpan  City  ethnic  minority \n1. \ndevelopment plans (EMDPs) ensure that ethnic minorities will benefit equitably from the Project \nand  that  any  negative  impacts  affecting  them  will  be  reduced  or  mitigated.  Provisions  to \nenhance  the  economic  conditions  of  ethnic  minorities  have  been  integrated  into  the  project \ndesign and project assurances. Compensation and livelihood restoration measures are included \nin the resettlement plans to ensure that ethnic minority households affected by land acquisition \nbenefit  equally  from  the  Project.  Government  policies  and  programs  for  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  further  protect  and  enhance  project  benefits.  The  EMDPs  are  based  on  relevant \nlaws  and  regulations  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nGenerally, the project components in all five cities are the same. These include (i) road \nconstruction  and  associated  infrastructure,  and  (ii)  environmental  sanitation  facilities.  There  is \ngreater  emphasis  on  environmental  subcomponents  in  cities  with  the  largest  ethnic  minority \npopulations. \n \nC. \n \nAs the PRC\u2019s largest autonomous region, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) \n3. \nis  a  low-income  region  with  a  small  population  (20  million),  of  which  60.4%  is  composed  of \nethnic  minority  groups.  The  Uygur  are  the  largest  of  these  groups  constituting  45.9%  of  the \npopulation,  and  the  Tartar  the  smallest  constituting  0.1%  of  the  population.  Other  significant \nethnic minority groups include the Kazakh (6.9%), and the Hui (4.4%).  \n \n4. \nAltay City is located in the northern frontier region of Xinjiang and is the capital of Altay \nPrefecture.  In  2007,  the  population  was  228,700  and  of  these  65.0%  was  classified \nnonagricultural. Altay\u2019s population is made up of 26 nationalities, including Han, Kazakh, Uygur, \nHui,  Mongolian,  Xibo,  Uzbek,  Russian,  Tartar,  Manchu,  and  Daur.  The  minority  population  of \nAltay  is  39.19%  of  the  total  population.  In  January  2008,  there  were  4,716  households \nconsisting of 12,492 persons or 10.8% of the nonagricultural population of Altay city entitled to \nthe minimum standard of living (MSL) subsidy. The urban unemployment rate in Altay is about \n1.95%.  In  2006,  the  annual  per  capita  net  income  of  the  farmers  and  herders  in  Altay  is \nCNY3,837. This is high compared to the Xinjiang Province average level of CNY2,737 and the \nannual  disposable  income  of  the  urban  residents  in  Altay  of  CNY10,539  compared  to  the \nautonomous regional average level of CNY9,120. \n \n5. \nChangji is the capital of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and it is the satellite town of \nUrumqi, the provincial capital. The distance between these two cities is only 30 kilometers. The \ngross  domestic  product  of  Urumqi  and  Changji  accounts  for  one-third  of  the  regions\u2019  gross \ndomestic product. In December 2004, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government (XUARG) \ndecided  to  combine  Urumqi  and  Changji  and  implement  the  Urumqi  and  Changji  economic \nintegration strategy. In 2006, Changji had 138,100 households consisting of 411,200 persons of \nwhom  70%  were  engaged  in  nonagricultural  based  activities.  In  2006,  the  minority  population \nwas 91,600 accounting for 22.28% of the total city population. The major ethnic minority group \nis  the  Hui,  followed  by  the  Kazakh,  Uygur,  Mongol,  Manchu,  Xibo,  Russian,  Uzbek,  Kyrgyz, \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nTartar, Daur, and Tajik. There are 6,397 persons or 2.22% of nonagricultural persons entitled in \nthe MSL system for urban residents. In 2006, the income of urban residents was CNY8,740 per \ncapita, but the income of farmers and herders was lower at CNY6,059.  \n \nHami city is located in the eastern area of Xinjiang. It is the capital of Hami Prefecture \n6. \nand is famous for the Hami melon. In 2006, the total population of Hami was 420,500 and the \nnonagricultural  population  accounted  for  68.3%  of  this  total.  Hami\u2019s  population  is  made  up  of \n24 nationalities,  including  Uygur,  Han,  Kazakh,  Manchu,  Mongol,  Xibo,  Russian,  Tajik,  Daur, \nTartar, and Uzbek. The ethnic minority population accounted for 28.48% of the total population. \nIn  2006,  Hami  had  5,530  households  constituting  11,182  persons  or  4.08%  of  nonagricultural \npersons receiving MSL.  \n \nKuytun is a city in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and is located in the center of the \n7. \n\u201cGolden  Triangle\u201d  of  the  Tianshan  Mountain  Northern  Slope  economic  belt.  In  2006,  the  total \npopulation  of  Kuytun  was  305,500  and  the  nonagricultural  population  accounted  for  96.5%  of \nthis total. Kuytun\u2019s population is made up of 30 nationalities, the main ethnic minority being the \nHui  followed  by  Kazakh,  Xibo,  Uzbek,  Manchu,  Mongol,  Kyrgyz,  Tajik,  and  Daur.  The  ethnic \nminority  population  accounted  for  7.27%  of  the  total  population.  In  2007,  Kuytun  had  890 \nhouseholds constituting 2,203 persons or 1.57% of nonagricultural beneficiaries receiving MSL. \nIn 2006, the annual urban resident disposable income was CNY8,148 per capita and the annual \nnet  income  of  farmers  and  herders  was  CNY2,903  per  capita.  The  registered  unemployment \nrate in Kuytun was below 3.9%. \n \n8. \nTurpan city is the capital of Turpan Prefecture. It was a traditional destination on the Silk \nRoad and today the prefecture has become an important tourism site and a priority development \narea for Xinjiang.  In 2007, the visitors to Turpan numbered 4.04 million and they generated a \ntotal of CNY0.78 billion in tourism revenue. In 2006, the population was 263,200 of whom 32% \nwas classified nonagricultural. Turpan\u2019s population is made up of 29 nationalities, with the Uygur \nconstituting  71%  of  the  total  population  followed  by  the  Hui,  Manchu,  Mongol,  Russian,  Xibo, \nUzbek, and Daur. The ethnic minority population accounts for 78.7% of the total population. The \nannual urban resident disposable income was CNY7,068 per capita and the annual net income \nof  farmers  and  horticulturalists  was  CNY3,777  per  capita.  There  are  2,170  households \nconstituting  5,164  persons  or  6.7%  of  the  nonagricultural  population  of  Turpan  city  who  are \nentitled to the MSL subsidy. \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe EMDPs ensure that (i) ethnic minority people are given opportunities to participate \nin all stages and receive the benefits of the Project, and (ii) the strategies developed to mitigate \nagainst  negative  impacts  are  sensitive  to  the  culture  of  affected  minority  groups.  Project \nassurances  address  prioritization  of  ethnic  minorities  and  vulnerable  groups  for  employment \nopportunities.  The  skills  and  language  training  will  help  ensure  sustainability  of  incomes  and \nlivelihoods. \n \nThe  social  and  poverty  assessment  indicates  that  the  overall  positive  impacts  of  the \n10. \nProject  (improved  mobility  and  access,  sanitation,  and  environmental  protection)  on  ethnic \nminorities will be the same as on the Han population. However, in relation to the development of \nthe tourism industry, ethnic minorities will be the major beneficiaries, especially in Altay, Hami, \nand Turpan. Impacts are expected to be gender neutral, with men and women benefiting from \ntemporary  job  creation;  and  women  from  reduced  domestic  and  care  work,  opportunities  for \nincome generation from tourism growth, and project related business initiatives.  \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nThe  Project  involves  resettlement  and  relocation  caused  by  demolition  of  houses  and \n11. \nshops. Of the 117 affected households in Altay, 14% are  ethnic minorities. In Changji, among \nthe total of 349 affected households, 48 households or 13.8% are ethnic minority households. In \nHami,  of  the  99  affected  households,  there  are  65  ethnic  minority  households  accounting  for \n65.7%  of  affected  households.  In  Turpan,  of  the  310  affected  households,  304  households  or \n98% of households are ethnic minority households. Of affected people requiring partial income \nrestoration,  15.7%  of  such  households  are  ethnic  minority  households  in  Changji,  46.5%  in \nHami, and 70.7% in Turpan. There are no land acquisition and resettlement impacts in Kuytun. \nThe resettlement plans for each of the four cities affected by resettlement and the environmental \nmanagement  plan,  outline  strategies  for  mitigation  of  negative  impacts  that  will  be  equally \napplicable  to  both  ethnic  minorities  and  Han  people.  In  cooperation  with  the  Civil  Affairs \nDepartment,  the  resettlement  plans  also  outline  special  funds  that  have  been  established  to \nprovide  additional  aid, including  subsidies  and medical  care  for  vulnerable  and  ethnic  minority \ngroups.  \n \n12. \nThe  project  management  office  (PMO)  has  agreed  to  the  assurances  obliging \ncontractors  to  employ  local  labor,  and  workers  from  ethnic  minorities  will  be  particularly \ntargeted.  Skills  training  in  construction,  language  training,  and  tourism  will  be  provided  in \ncoordination with other government and local stakeholders. Attention to ethnic minority cultural \nissues  will  be  addressed  through  awareness  building  with  workers  and  prohibitions  on \nconstruction  near  religious  sites  on  particular  days,  such  as  during  Friday  prayers  at  the \nmosque. Information and education activities on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV will be \nsupported by the Project and the Center for Disease Control in each city. The expansion of bus \nand taxi services will pay attention to ensuring that public transportation is available for the new \nrelocation sites and improved roads (predominantly ethnic minority areas). \n \nE. \n \nDuring  preparation,  affected  persons  and  ethnic  minority  populations  living  in  the  five \n13. \nproject  cities  were  extensively  consulted  about  the  likely  positive  and  negative  impacts  of  the \nProject and participated in outlining actions to enhance positive outcomes. Other stakeholders \nconsulted include (i) heads of affected person households (excluding Kuytun), (ii) village heads \nand villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local government agencies and departments, and (iv) women \nand  vulnerable  groups.  From  March  to  May  2008,  consultative  meetings  were  held  in  the  five \nproject cities and Urumqi to discuss and finalize the EMDPs. Upon ADB approval, the EMDPs \nwill  be  endorsed  and  disclosed  to  the  targeted  villages,  townships,  and  subdistricts  and \nuploaded  to  the  ADB  website.  The  participation  and  disclosure  plan  will  use  notices  and \nmeetings to deal with all aspects of the Project, such as notification of employment and training \nopportunities,  land  acquisition  details,  EMDP  actions,  and  general  information  and  feedback \nsessions. During the project implementation period, the PMOs will encourage affected persons \nto  participate  in  additional  resettlement  activities  such  as  skills  training.  Ethnic  minorities  will \nparticipate  in  the  formulation  of  compensation  standards  and  relocation  plans.  To  resolve  any \ngrievances  and  ensure  smooth  construction  and  project  implementation,  a  clear,  transparent, \nand efficient complaint and appeals channel with redress mechanisms has been outlined. This \nwill be the same for grievances arising from both resettlement plan and EMDP implementation. \nMonitoring indicators related to participation and feedback have been incorporated into the plan. \n \n\nConsultation and Disclosure  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nBudgeting and Financing Sources \n\nImplementation/Institutional Arrangements \n\nF. \n \n14. \nThe  city  government  and  implementing  agency  (IA)  in  each  project  city  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  EMDP.  The  Ethnic  Affairs  Bureau  will  provide  support  to \ncoordinate, advise, and monitor implementation progress. Implementation arrangements for the \nEMDPs  have  been  integrated  into  project  management,  or  are  part  of  ongoing  government \nprograms.  Other  key  agencies  include  the  Center  for  Disease  Control,  Civil  Affairs  Bureau, \nLabor  and  Social  Security  Bureau,  and  the  All-China  Women\u2019s  Federation.  The  Ethnic  Affairs \nBureau will provide oversight and review of external monitoring, evaluation reports, and provide \nrecommendations.  Township  governments  and  subdistrict  offices  will  assign  staff \nfor \nimplementation  and  coordination.  The  IA  will  have  a  member  responsible  for  EMDP \nimplementation.  \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe EMDP activities will not require a separate budget. The actions are either included \nas  (i)  part  of  the  project  budgets,  or  (ii)  part  of  local  government  development  budgets.  Local \ngovernment  agencies  will  collaborate  with  the  Executing  Agency  and  city  government,  while \nlocal government budgets cover their staffing and related costs. Project actions are cost under \nthe resettlement plans and project contracts.  \n \nH. \n \n16. \nRegular  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  EMDPs  will  ensure  that  the  plans  are \nimplemented properly. Objectives of the monitoring and evaluation plans with respect to ethnic \nminorities  will  be  (i)  to  collect  data  and  information  to  identify  project  impacts  based  on  the \ndevelopment  monitoring  framework  in  the  social  and  poverty  assessment  and  the  monitoring \nframeworks  for  resettlement,  including  qualitative  information  to  describe  social  or  poverty \nchanges  on  ethnic  minorities  and  their  communities;  and  (ii)  to  ensure  that  appropriate \napproaches  have  been  adopted  and  the  goals  have  been  achieved.  The  city  government  and \nexecuting agency in each city will undertake internal monitoring. Independent organizations will \nbe hired for each area in conjunction with the resettlement plan external monitoring agency to \nprovide  independent  advice  on  progress,  impacts,  and  outcomes.  Terms  of  reference  for \nexternal  monitoring  are  appended  to  the  EMDPs.  The  project  component  in  five  cities  is \nscheduled to commence in 2009 and finish in 2013. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nFinancial Analysis of Non-Revenue Generating Components \n\nA. \n \nFinancial analysis has been prepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n1. \n(ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 Financial analysis \nwas  carried  out  to  ensure  fiscal  sustainability  of  the  project  components  by  analyzing  city \ngovernment finances of Altay city government, Changji city government, Hami city government, \nKuytun city government, and Turpan city government.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  historical  financial  performance  of  the  city  governments  has  been  analyzed  to \n2. \ndetermine  whether  they  can  provide  the  required  counterpart  funds  during  the  construction \nperiod and necessary funds for operation and maintenance (O&M) and debt service during the \noperating period. In addition, annual average growth rates of revenues and expenditures during \nthe project period are calculated. The average income growth rate ranged from 11% to 12% per \nyear.  The  same  growth  rates  are  used  in  projecting  the  revenues  of  the  cities  during \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  sources  of  income  of  these  cities  are  from  tax  and  nontax \nrevenues  and  from  subsidies  and/or  direct  transfers  from  the  provincial  prefectures  and  the \nregional governments. Kuytun registered surplus for the period 2003 and 2004. Altay, Changji, \nHami, and Turpan over the last 5 years did not register any surplus funds; their incomes are just \nenough  to  sustain  their  operations.  Altay  and  Turpan  have  been  very  dependent  on  transfers \nfrom  the  regional  government.  The  transfers  and  subsidies  to  the  city  budgets  are  in  Table \nA.12.1.  Their  internally  generated  funds  from  tax  and  nontax  resources  are  not  sufficient  to \ncover recurring costs. It is recommended that assurance be sought for additional transfer from \nthe national budget to support the provision of counterpart funds during implementation of the \nProject.   \n \n\nTable A12.1: Financial Performance Assessment Results \n(%) \n\n Item \nAnnual Income Growth \nTax and Nontax Revenues \nSubsidies and Transfers \n\n \nAltay City \n\nChangji \nCity \n\n \nHami City \n\nKuytun \nCity \n\nTurpan \nCity \n\n11 \n22 \n78 \n\n11 \n84 \n16 \n\n12 \n68 \n32 \n\n11 \n89 \n11 \n\n12 \n59 \n41 \n\nFiscal Impact Assessment \n\n   Source: Asian Development Bank.   \n \nC. \n \n3. \nFinancial sustainability of the components during both the implementation and operation \nphase has been determined. The fiscal impact assessment of the implementing agencies (IAs) \nhas been assessed by comparing annual collections from the identified financing sources with \nthe annual counterpart funds required for (i) capital expenditures during project implementation, \nand (ii) recurrent costs for O&M and debt services of the project components during operation. \nInterest  and  principal  repayments  for  the  ADB  loan  are  estimated  based  on  a  grace  period  of \n5 years and a maturity of 20 years.

Hami  city  government  will  provide  about  $10.1  million  in  counterpart  funds  during \nimplementation and $0.8 million per year during operation. Kuytun city government will provide \nabout $15.3 million in counterpart funds during implementation and $1.3 million per year during \noperation.  Turpan  city  government  will  provide  about  $18.8  million  in  counterpart  funds  during \nimplementation  and  $1.5  million  per  year  during  operation.  Assessment  of  projected  annual \nrevenues  shows  that  each  IA  has  the  necessary  counterpart  funds  for  its  respective \ncomponents.  \n \nThe  analysis  indicates  that  based  on  the  identified  fund  sources  during  project \n5. \npreparation  (including  new  budgets,  subsidies,  and  allocation  that  will  be  earmarked),  all \ncomponents should have sufficient funds available for counterpart funds during implementation \nand  O&M  costs  and  debt  service  during  operation  period.  Estimated  annual  forecasted  debt \nservice  and  O&M  costs  are  found  to  be  about  2%  of  the  city  budget  annual  revenues.  This \nindicates acceptable fiscal risk since it is expected that fiscal revenues of the city governments \nwill grow in line with economic development, providing more mobility for the city governments to \nfinance proposed project components.

Details  of \nthe financial management assessment are in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \n7. \nThe questionnaire was administered to the finance departments of XUARG and the city \ngovernments.  It  has  determined  the  accounting  and  financial  capacity  needs  during  project \nimplementation and operations after project completion. The assessment of XUARG\u2019s previous \nexperience  in  managing  foreign-assisted  projects  confirms  that  its  financial  management \npractices are adequate for implementation of the Project. XUARG is currently implementing an \nADB-financed project and has adequate capacity and experience to implement this Project. In \nthe  case  of  the  IAs,  each  city  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial \nmanagement system at the beginning of project implementation. Each city will keep accounts in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s accounting standards and subject to independent external audit by \nsuitably  qualified  commercial  or  government  auditors.  Accounting  will  be  in  accordance  with \nrelevant  PRC  national  accounting  standards.  All  IAs  will  meet  ADB  requirements  for  auditing \narrangements  and  submit  audited  financial  statements  to  ADB  annually.  A  capacity  building \ncomponent to strengthen financial management has been included in the Project. \n \n8. \nThe IAs have adequate procedures in managing and safeguarding their assets. All IAs\u2019 \nsubsidiary  ledgers  of  fixed  assets  and  inventories  are  well  maintained.  Office  buildings  and \nother fixed assets are provided with insurance coverage. Physical inventories of fixed assets are \nconducted  periodically.  The  IAs  have  effective  asset  management  systems  in  place  and  are \nfound to be generally satisfactory. \n \n9. \nThe  overall  financial  management  arrangements  of  the  IAs  are  generally  satisfactory \nand  reliable.  ADB\u2019s  financial  due  diligence  requirements,  especially  the  audit  and  reporting \nrequirements, will be particularly emphasized to the IAs. The IAs\u2019 staff concerned will be trained \nin ADB loan processing and policies and related procedures for procurement and disbursement, \namong others. Staff will undergo training in project management and relevant ADB procedures \nduring  implementation  of  the  Project.  With  the  help  of  international  and  national  consultants, \ncapacity  will  be  strengthened  in  (i)  project  financial  management,  accounting,  and  business \nplanning;  and  (ii)  management  information  system  and  cost  management  and  control.  The \nrespective IAs will establish a well-staffed project management office. The IAs will be required to \nmaintain  a  separate  book  of  accounts  specifically  for  the  Project  to  ensure  that  project \nconstruction and management activities can be accounted for separately. This will facilitate the \npreparation of the financial reports required to be submitted to ADB annually during the duration \nof the Project.    \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n61 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe economic analysis covers five components of the Project. For the overall Project, the \n1. \nanalysis covers (i) economic rationale for public intervention, (ii) the goals of the investment plan, \nand (iii) the design of the plan. The economic analysis also evaluates the components relative to \nleast-cost analysis criteria and standard benefit-cost analysis. Economic analysis was conducted \nin accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines for Economic Analysis of \nProjects  (2001).  The  detailed  economic  analysis  and  least-cost  analysis  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix L. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of the Overall Project \n\n2. \nRationale for Public Intervention. The primary motivation for the Project results from the \nincreasing concern over the effects of population growth and economic growth on the inadequacy \nof  public  services  in  the  cities  of  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang).  Continuing \nurbanization has resulted in increasing demand for private cars, changes in lifestyle that create a \nmore  diversified  range  of  travel  demands,  and  changes  in  urban  land  use  patterns  that  are \nincreasingly  dependent  on  motorized  transport.  This  contributes  to  major  deficiencies  in  urban \nroad networks and services. Furthermore, urban areas face environmental threats from pollution \nof  surface  and  subsurface  waters  from  untreated  garbage.  In  2006,  the  urban  population  in \nXinjiang accounted for about 37% of the total population. This is expected to increase to 42% by \n2010 and 47% by 2015. \n \n3. \nThe  strategic  location  of  Xinjiang  as  a  major  transport  corridor  and  as  the  gateway \nbetween  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Central  Asian  countries1 is  expected  to  spur \neconomic development and contribute to tourism development. The region is also rich in natural \nresources  including  oil,  metals,  and  minerals,  which  provide  a  sound  basis  for  economic \ndevelopment. With the expected rise in trade and tourism brought about by cooperation activities \nunder  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Program,  development  of  necessary \ninfrastructure support facilities is critical to sustained economic growth and development. \n \n4 \nPoor  condition  of  urban  roads  and  solid  waste  management  demonstrate  the  need  for \ngovernment  investments.  The  private  sector,  which  is  a  victim  of  poor  roads  and  solid  waste \nmanagement,  does  not  possess  sufficient  investment  resources  to  solve  the  problems  and \nimprove  the  quality  of  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Therefore,  government  intervention  is \neconomically sound and justified.  The Government has a role in controlling negative externalities \nfrom untreated waste and coordinating the management of urban roads. It has a role in promoting \nurban  development  in  a  more  coordinated  manner  and  integrating  both  government  and \nbeneficiary efforts  in  bringing  more  sustainable investments  in  physical infrastructure.  Since  the \noutput of the proposed projects cannot be reasonably be sold, local government departments will \nbe  the  managers  and  maintainers.  However,  contracting  operations  and  maintenance  of  urban \nroads and solid waste management to the private sector is encouraged. \n \n5. \nThe  Project  involves  government  intervention  at  several  different  levels.  The  Xinjiang \nUygur  Autonomous  Region  government  (XUARG)  is  promoting  development  in  the  cities  in  a \nmore  coordinated  and  cost-effective  manner  by  bringing about  more  sustainable  investments  in \nphysical  and  environmental  protection  infrastructure  that  aim  to  improve  the  quality  of  life. \nInvolvement of the XUARG is justified since the development program spans several prefectures \n                                                 \n1   The  Second  Eurasia  Continental  Bridge  railway  line  connects  Europe  to  East  Asia  through  the  Xinjiang  Uygur \n\nAutonomous Region. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n62  \n \n\nand cities. The city governments are coordinating and implementing the elements of urban road \nmaster plans and making individual investments in roads and environmental sanitation. They will \nalso be involved in owning and managing the completed facilities. The Government has a role in \npromoting  urban  development  in  a  more  coordinated  manner  and  integrating  both  government \nand beneficiary efforts in bringing about more sustainable investments in physical infrastructure. \nGovernment involvement in individual projects is justified since both solid waste management and \nurban roads are natural monopolies. City governments through the construction bureau manage \nurban roads, sanitation, and other essential public utilities and services in the towns.  \n \n6. \nGoals  of  the  Investment  Plan.  The Project is a direct response to Xinjiang\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear  Plan  (11FYP)  to  promote  sustainable  economic  development,  particularly  in  its  cities,  via \nconstruction and upgrading of roads infrastructure while protecting the environment. The 11FYP \nrecognizes  that  achieving  these  goals  will  require  the  improvement  of  basic  municipal  services \nand environmental quality in these areas. All subcomponents in the proposed Project are integral \ncomponents  of  the  11FYP.  City  governments  are  required  to  make  investments  in  roads  and \nenvironmental sanitation. The city and area government master plans are reasonably sound and \nare integrated with the overall planning process. \n \nC. \n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections \n\nIn  Changji  City,  the  existing  traffic  was  determined  using  travel  demand  volumes  and \n7. \npatterns. The traffic volume was based on existing travel patterns, population, and the proposed \nland use of the road\u2019s zone of influence. The demand model contains some form of mathematical \nrelationships  that  relate  travel  demand  with  external  factors  such  as  population  and  land  use. \nSince  a  complete  dataset  of  travel  demand  patterns  and  behavioral  parameters  fundamental  to \nthe  accurate  description  of  the  existing  situation  is  very  costly  to  obtain  (e.g.,  origin\u2013destination \nmovements of travelers are difficult to obtain without interviewing), the demand forecasting model \nrelies on estimation techniques and professional judgment for the development of the base year \nmodel to represent the existing situation. The model area was set (zone A and zone B). The zone \nencompasses the area over which all the economic benefits and costs of the Project will be felt. \nThe model was segmented to reflect the characteristics of the area\u2019s zone of influence as follows: \n(i) peak hours since travel time varies significantly between morning peak hour and evening peak \nhour;  and  (ii)  vehicle  classes  were  differentiated  within  the  model,  such  as  cars,  trucks,  and \nbuses.  Traffic  forecast  was  determined  based  on  socioeconomic  trends  that  took  into  account \nchanges  in  variables  such  as  gross  domestic  product,  population,  and  vehicle  ownership.  The \nforecast gross domestic product growth rates were applied to the calibrated base year matrices to \nproduce passenger and freight vehicle flows. \n\n8. \nThe  other  cities\u2019  traffic  analyses  were  performed  in  terms  of  (i)  selecting  and  defining \nvehicle  type\u2019s  representative,  (ii)  assessing  annual  average  daily  traffic,  and  (iii)  forecasting \ndemand. A vehicle fleet consists of a mix of several vehicle types that use a road network. The \ntraffic  survey  serves  as  the  basis  for  determining  average  annual  daily  traffic.  To  establish  the \naverage  annual  daily  traffic  from  the  average  daily  traffic,  seasonal  variations  were  assessed \ntaking into account the main factors driving changes in traffic patterns, such as the rainy season, \nwinter,  and  tourist  season.  Winter  has  a  direct  impact  on  traffic  patterns.  Heavy  snowfall  can \ncause frequent road closures. Traffic forecast is composed of (i) growth for normal traffic, which \ncorresponds  to  the  growth  that  would  occur  even  without  improving  the  road  network;  and \n(ii) generated traffic, which occurs only in cases where there is a significant improvement in the \nroad network. In both cases, traffic projections also took into account potential generated traffic. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n63 \n\nD. \n\nEvaluation of Individual Components \n\n9. \nThe  least-cost  analysis  ensures  that  each  subproject  is  optimally  designed  to  meet  the \ngoals  of  the  Project  and  does  not  involve  unnecessary  extra  costs.  The  least-cost  analysis  has \ncovered  all  feasible  alternatives  for  a  given  component,  including  variations  in  technology  and \nlocation.  Each  subproject  has  been  designed  at  least  cost  in  terms  of  location,  scale  (planning \nhorizon), and technology. Detailed evaluation of options has been undertaken to meet the least-\ncost  criterion.  The  present  value  of  economic  cost  approach  has  been  adopted  for  the  roads, \nincluding environmental sanitation. The analysis uses a simplified approach based on annualized \ncapital,  operation,  maintenance,  and  management  costs;  and  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital of 12%. Detailed calculation and discussion of the cost-effectiveness analysis is presented \nin Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n10. \nIn  addition  to  being  part  of  the  11FYP,  each  component  is  economically  justified  on  its \nown.  Economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  have  been  estimated  for  each  road  subproject. \nThe EIRRs are compared with the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is assumed to be \n12%. Major  benefits that have been  quantified for the roads include the following: (i) savings in \nvehicle  operating  costs  resulting  from  reduced  travel  distance  and  improved  road  conditions, \n(ii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  (iii)  reduced  maintenance  costs,  (iv)  savings  in  the \nvalue of passengers\u2019 time and of freight tied up in transit, and (v) generated traffic resulting from \nreduced transportation costs. \n\n11. \nThe economic analysis has been conducted over 25 years, including project construction. \nEconomic benefits and costs are denominated in domestic price numeraire at constant mid-2008 \nprices. Foreign currency costs have been converted into local currency costs using the exchange \nrate  of  CNY6.85  per  $1  and  adjusted  based  on  purchasing  power  parity  assumption.  Project \ntradable  components  have  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor of 1.013 and non-tradable components valued at domestic market prices. Project costs and \nbenefits  have  been  estimated  on  a  without-project  and  with-project  basis.  Transfer  payments \nhave been excluded in the valuation of cost estimates in economic prices. The financial prices of \nthe  different  components  of  volatile  organic  compounds  (such  as  fuel,  lubricants,  tires,  vehicle \nmaintenance  cost,  driver/crew  cost)  have  been  adjusted  to  economic  prices  using  appropriate \nconversion factors: 1.013 for tradable and 1.0 for non-tradable. A shadow wage conversion factor \nof  0.67  is  applied  for  all  types  of  work  time  for  vehicle  maintenance  labor  and  vehicle  operator \nlabor  and  1.0  for  nonworking  time.  The  shadow  coefficient  used  for  budget  transfers  such  as \ntaxes and subsidies is zero. Passenger time savings are divided into working and leisure. Leisure \ntime is assumed at 30% of work time. Passenger working time is adjusted by the shadow wage \nrate  factor  of  0.67  and  the  nonworking  time  by  a  conversion  factor  of  1.0.  Standard  sensitivity \ntests, and additional tests for a 1-year implementation delay and 20% increase in operation and \nmaintenance costs, have been conducted. \n\n12. \nThe  economic  costs  include  (i)  the  capital  cost,  including  physical  contingencies,  land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  environmental  monitoring,  and  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  the  cost  of \noperation  and  maintenance,  including  the  cost  of  replacement  of  depreciated  equipment.  The \nland acquisition and resettlement costs have been based on their opportunity costs, that is, the \nagricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced economic activities.2 Residual values, if \nany, have been treated as negative costs at the end of the project life. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The economic opportunity costs of land have been assumed to be equivalent to the replacement value of farmland, \n\nwhich has been calculated for land compensation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n64  \n \n\nResults of Economic Analysis of Individual Components \n\nE. \n \n13. \nTables A13.1 and A13.2 show the results of the base cases and sensitivity tests.
