An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nIts summary is a core appendix. \n \nThe Project will reduce poverty by improving the safety, reliability, \nand efficiency of transport services to the outer atolls and islands \nthrough construction of navigation aids, small wharves and jetties, \nairstrip  extensions,  warehouses,  and \nimprovements. \nComplementary nonlending assistance will strengthen institutional \ncapacity to manage shipping and air services to the outer islands.  \n \nThirty percent of the population live in the 18 outer islands in the \nproject area. Communities in the outer islands suffer from physical \nisolation  leading  to  low  incomes,  lack  of  basic  services,  and \npoverty of opportunity. The people who live in these outer islands \nhave significantly lower incomes than the national average, and it \nis estimated that almost two thirds of the population in the project \narea have an income level below the United Nations Development \nProgramme poverty line threshold of $1 a day. \n \nTransport  services  provide  the  lifeline  to  these  outer  islands. \nShipping  brings  in  essential  goods  and  services,  and  takes  out \nisland produce from which the people earn a substantial portion of \ntheir  incomes.  Shipping  also  brings  in  government  services  and \nsupplies,  particularly  to  schools  and  health  clinics.  Shipping \nprovides an essential service to families in transporting children to \nand  from  secondary  schools  and  colleges  elsewhere  in  the \nRepublic  of  the  Marshall  Islands,  and  in  providing  links  for \neveryone to the urban centers and the outside world. Air services \nprovide  passenger  and  freight  transport,  as  well  as  emergency \nevacuation services for sick and vulnerable people. \n \nTransport  operations  are  at  present  complicated  by  poor \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  in  the  outer  islands.  In  particular,  the \nsea approaches and landings on coral atolls are often constrained \nby  narrow  reef  passages,  navigation  obstructions,  and  shallow \nreef  flats,  making  landing  difficult.  Weather,  sea,  and  light \nconditions  restrict  the  time  available  for  anchoring  and  lightering \ngoods and passengers ashore; passengers are subject to greater \nrisk  and  discomfort;  and  there  is  frequent  damage  to  cargo. \nNavigation aids are almost entirely absent and there are few ship \ndocks  or small  boat jetties.  Where  beach landings are required, \n\n\f \nii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjective and Scope \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\nchannels  need  to  be  cleared  to  allow  small  boats  to  reach  the \nshore. On land, warehousing for storing goods and local produce \nfor export is required at a central location to improve the efficiency \nof  shipping  operations.  Most  atolls  have  airstrips,  but  they  are \nunsealed  and  often  poorly  maintained.  In  some  cases,  restricted \nrunway length reduces aircraft capacity and range. \n \nTogether,  these  constraints  lead  to  infrequent  and  unreliable \nschedules,  increased  safety  risks  to  passengers  and  cargo,  and \nadded  costs  to  outer  island  transport.  These,  in  turn,  limit  the \nopportunity for social interaction; access to education, health, and \nbusiness development services; and the ability of public agencies \nto deliver programs and develop social infrastructure in the outer \nislands.  It  also  increases  the  prices  of  essential  goods  and \ndiscourages  production  and  marketing  of  local  produce,  such  as \ncopra, fruits and vegetables, fish, and handicrafts. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  through  safer, \nmore frequent, and reliable shipping and transport services in the \nouter  islands  that  will  (i)  improve  access  to  basic  goods  and \nservices,  and  (ii)  assist  in  increasing  incomes  from  the  sale  of \nproduce and handicrafts from the outer islands in the main centers \nof Majuro and Ebeye. \n \nThe  scope  of  the  Project  includes  the  construction,  installation, \nand/or improvement/renovation of: \n \n(i)  outer island port infrastructure, comprising docks, jetties, and \n\nbeach channels; \n\nlights; \n\n(ii)  navigation  aids,  comprising  lit  beacons,  buoys,  and  land \n\n(iii)  improvements to tracks for goods movement; \n(iv)  storage warehouses for concentration of cargo; and \n(v)  airstrip extensions and remedial maintenance. \n \nThe Project is estimated to cost $10.0 million equivalent, of which \n$6.84 million equivalent (68.4%) is the foreign exchange cost and \n$3.16 million equivalent (31.6%) is the local currency cost. \n \n\nForeign \nCurrency \n($ million) \n6.84 \n0.00 \n6.84 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n($ million) \n0.16 \n3.00 \n3.16 \n\nTotal Cost \n($ million) \n7.00 \n3.00 \n     10.00 \n\nFinancing \n(%) \n70.0 \n30.0 \n     100.0 \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n\f \niii\n\nLoan Amount and Terms  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of Special \nDrawing  Rights  5.304  million  (equivalent  to  $7.0 million)  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources.

The  Project  provides  for  the  construction  of  island  docks,  jetties,  beach  channels, \nnavigation  aids,  runway  extensions  and  onshore  supporting  infrastructure  on  18  outer  islands, \nnationwide. The project framework is in Appendix 1. The report also describes complementary \nnonlending technical assistance (TA) for improving the delivery of sea and air transport services \nto  help  ensure  that  the  full  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  realized;  and  if  the  proposed \nloan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nOverview \n\n2. \nThe RMI comprises 29 coral atolls and five true islands scattered over 1.9 million square \nkilometers (km2) of the central Pacific Ocean. The atolls are distributed over 900 km from north \nto  south  and  1,200  km  from  east  to  west  in  two  roughly  parallel  chains  running  northwest  to \nsoutheast\u2014the eastern Ralik Chain and the western Ratak Chain. The total land area of about \n180  km2  constitutes  only  0.01%  of  the  total  geographic  area  within  the  RMI\u2019s  exclusive \neconomic  zone.  The  population  of  the  RMI  from  the  1999  population  census  was  50,840 \nconcentrated  in  the  two  main  atolls  of  Majuro  (23,676)  and  Kwajalein  (Ebeye)  (10,902).  The \nouter  islands  support  populations  of  between  95  and  2,000  spread  over  numerous  islets, \ntypically with population concentrations of up to 200 per km2. In some cases, individual islets are \nconnected  by  dry  reef  at  low  tide  and  in  a  few  cases  have  been  connected  by  engineered \ncauseways. \n \n3. \nThe outer island population subsists on a diet of fish, coconut, breadfruit, pandanus, and \nother produce, supplemented with imported rice, flour, and sugar. The main cash crop is copra. \nOther outer island production includes handicrafts, small quantities of fruits and vegetables, and \nfish for sale in Majuro and Ebeye. Vessels also carry passengers and general cargo to and from \nthe outer islands.  \n \n4. \nThe Ministry of Resources and Development is presently investigating opportunities for: \ndiversification of crops and other economic activities, including fruit and vegetable production to \nenhance atoll diets and to sell in the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye; increasing fish catches \nfor sale in the urban markets; aquaculture, especially seaweed and pearls; noni fruit production; \nand ecotourism.  It is also investigating the possibility of improving local value added from copra \nthrough  the  production  of  additional  by-products  (charcoal,  brooms,  and  coir)  for  the  local \nmarket,  and  through  trialing  of  cold-pressed  virgin  oil  for  cooking  and  cosmetic  use.  Other \nresearch includes intercropping coconuts with corn for animal feed. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty \n\nThe islands of the project area have household incomes well below the national average \n5. \nand  reflect  the  largely  subsistence  nature  of  livelihood  in  the  outer  islands.  Forty  percent  of \nhouseholds  in  the  project  area  has  incomes  of  less  than  $1,000  per  annum,  and  70%  had \n\n\f2 \n\nincomes of less than $3,000. These figures compare with the national averages of 13.6% and \n27.5%, respectively. In six of the 18 project islands, the proportion of households with incomes \nless  than  $3,000  exceeds  75%.  In  one  island,  Lib,  it  reaches  100%.  Only  in  Jaluit,  Utirik,  and \nWotje do more than 50% of the households have incomes greater than $3,000. \n \n6. \nThe median per capita annual income shows that half of the outer island population was \nactually  earning  only  $0.62/day.  Both  measures  of  per  capita  income  indicate  that  almost  two \nthirds  of  the  population  of  the  project  area  had  incomes  well  below  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) standard threshold of $1 per day, the level that is considered \nnecessary to purchase an individual\u2019s minimum daily nutritional requirements. Within the project \narea, the islands with the lowest per capita incomes were Lib and Ailuk, at $0.22 and $0.59 per \ncapita per day, respectively. Those with the highest incomes were Jaluit ($1.96 per capita per \nday), Likiep ($1.81), Maloelap ($1.54), and Utirik ($1.53). On average, there was no significant \ndifference in the per capita incomes between the closer and the more distant islands. \n \n7. \nIn  health  indicators,  fewer  than  1%  of  the  households  in  the  project  area  have  piped \nwater, compared to a quarter of those in the other parts of the country. In the project area, wells \nor  rain  catchments  are  the  principal  sources  of  water;  these  are  both  susceptible  to \ncontamination.  In  respect  of  sanitation  facilities,  58%  of  households  in  the  project  area  either \nhave no toilet facilities or use pit latrines. This compares to only 18% in the rest of the country. \nThe  poor  sanitation  and  lack  of  safe  water  is  a  primary  cause  of  the  high  level  of  diarrheal \ndiseases  reported  in  the  outer  islands.  Diabetes,  measles,  hypertension,  and  most  recently \ntuberculosis, are among the other more prevalent diseases reported in the project area. \n \n\n3. \n\nInterisland Transport \n\n8. \nThe  islands  of  the  project  area  are  also  isolated  by  distance  and  by  infrequent  and \nunreliable sea transport. While air transport is available, it is at high cost and of limited capacity, \nparticularly  for  air  cargo.  This  isolation  discourages  cash  production  and  engagement  in  the \nwider  national  economy.  It  is  difficult  to  maintain  social  contacts  with  other  islands,  and  the \ndelivery of government social and economic development services is costly and constrained.  \n \nHistorically,  shipping  services  have  been  provided  directly  by  the  Government  through \n9. \nthe Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) at heavily subsidized freight rates \nand  passenger  fares,  in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  for  many  of  the  outer  islands  a  shipping \nservice is not commercially viable. The Government accepts some subsidy as unavoidable if it \nis to meet its social and economic objectives of reducing poverty, countering population drift to \nthe main centers, and expanding development opportunities for the outer island population.  \n \n10. \nIn 1999, with ADB assistance, in an effort to reduce the public subsidy requirement and \nto provide opportunities for the private sector to compete in the market, MOTC invited tenders \nfrom the private sector to operate shipping services (Appendix 2). A contract was awarded to a \nprivate operator and currently MOTC and the private franchisee both operate on the same route \non a rotational basis. This competition provides both a check on the private operator and a basis \nfor comparison of the efficiencies of government and private operations. \n \n11. \nHowever, the service could be substantially improved at a number of locations that are \ndifficult to service because of tidal restrictions. Often, up to six hours\u2014or half of the tidal cycle\u2014\nare lost because the water depths are too shallow for small boats to carry cargo or passengers \nbetween ship and shore. Another factor is weather, and locations facing the easterly quarter and \nthat  are  unprotected  by  land  can  be  difficult  to  access  because  of  wave  action.  In  many \n\n\f3 \n\ninstances,  creation  or  deepening  of  beach  channels,  navigation  aids1  and  marks,  new  or \nextended boat jetties, and ship docks would significantly improve ship turnaround times.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\n12. \n An  analysis  of  problems  and  constraints  is  given  in  Appendix  3.  There  are  physical \nconstraints  of  sea  approaches  and  berthing  at  outer  island  points  of  call,  coupled  with  the \ndifficulties  of  sustaining  a  reliable  shipping  service  where  distances  are  long  and  transport \nvolumes are low.  The institutional capacity for administering shipping service franchises and for \noperating government-owned vessels is limited, and the need to subsidize the shipping service \nhas been a long-term drain on the government budget. \n\n13. \nThe physical constraints of navigation and landing in the outer islands can be eased by \nselective provision of marine transport infrastructure, which is the main focus of the Project.  Of \nprime  importance  is  the  provision  of  navigation  aids,  which  will  allow  ships  to  safely  enter \nlagoons  and  approach  the  landing  places  under  poor  daylight  conditions  and  at  night.  \nImprovements  to  landings  through  ship  docks,  boat  jetties,  and  beach  channels  will  allow \nworking over a wider range of the tide cycle, ease the manual work involved, allow safer transfer \nof  passengers  between  ship  and  shore,  and  reduce  cargo  spoilage.  Outer  island  airstrips  are \ngenerally poorly maintained and, in some cases, short runway length limits take-off weight and \naircraft  carrying  capacity.  Runway  extensions  and  surface  improvements  will  both  increase \ntransport  capacity  and  reduce  aircraft  damage,  lowering  costs.  In  case  of  emergency,  air \ntransport is the only practical option and for this reason, adequate, well-maintained airstrips are \na strategic and lifeline necessity. \n\n14. \nIn several locations, transferring passengers and goods between ship and shore can be \ninconvenient, time consuming, and even hazardous. While sheltered anchorages exist in some \nlocations  so  that  small  boat  lighterage  is  straightforward,  in  other  places  onshore  prevailing \nwinds  and  long  fetches  either  across  the  ocean  or  wide  lagoons,  combined  with  wide  and \nshallow reef shelves, make discharge and embarkation difficult. It is in these locations that the \nbenefits of an improved landing will be the greatest. \n\n15. \nExperience in the past has been that government-provided shipping has imposed a high \ncost  on  the  MOTC  budget,  for  several  reasons:  (i) higher  wage  rates  for  public  sector \nemployees  and  little  incentive  for  improved  labor  productivity;  (ii) ships  of  a  size  and \nconfiguration that are not well suited to the service and that are expensive to run; (iii) diversion \nof  ships  from  their  service  schedule  by  government  direction;  and  (iv) difficulty  in  mobilizing \ncash for payment of operating expenses and for periodic maintenance. \n\n16. \nExperience  with  the  shipping  franchise  scheme  demonstrates  that  a  competitive \ntendering system to minimize subsidy payments and to remove shipping operations from direct \ngovernment  operation  is  feasible,  but  requires  some  modification.  It  is  important  that  other \ngovernment agencies do not operate subsidized shipping services in the franchise area, if the \nscheme  is  to  succeed.  However,  there  should  be  freedom  for  unsubsidized  private  or  local \ngovernment operators to provide services, as is currently done for atolls close to Majuro. \n\n                                                 \n1   Apart from some existing navigation marks for the main reef passages into Majuro and Kwajalein atolls, there are \nvery  few  navigation  aids  for  inter-  and  intra-atoll  shipping.  A  lack  of  navigation  aids  limits  navigation  in  many \nplaces to daylight hours and favorable tide and weather conditions. \n\n\f4 \n\nAir  Marshall  Islands  (AMI)  is  a  small  airline,  operating  only  two  Dornier  228  aircraft, \n17. \nwhich are used primarily on outer island services, and one flight a week from Majuro to Tarawa \nin Kiribati. Historically, AMI has operated international services to Fiji and to Honolulu and has \nhad longer-range passenger and freight capacity. Freight and longer-range passenger capacity \nto the furthest islands of Bikini and Enewetak is limited, and the airline has been endeavoring to \nlease  a  Dash-8  to  supplement  its  service.  The  airline  is  short  of  capital,  and  the  two  Dornier \naircraft  are  aging  and  experience  considerable  downtime,  and  will  eventually  require \nreplacement. The sector analysis is in Appendix 4. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n18. \nThese  infrastructure  deficiencies  add  considerable  time  to  voyages  of  the  field  trip \nvessels  as  well  as  exposing  vessels  and  cargo  to  damage  and  passengers  to  risk  and \ndiscomfort. Poverty reduction will be fostered by improvements to the regularity and reliability of \nship  visits  to  each  island.  This  will  have  the  following  poverty  reduction  benefits  and \nopportunities for the communities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nimproved availability of services from government agencies, including health and \neducation,  will  help  reduce  problems  of  access  to  basic  services,  information, \nsupplies  of  schoolbooks,  and  materials  and  supplies  for  island  clinics,  and  will \nassist in the implementation of other outer island projects through better transport \nof labor, materials, and equipment; \n\nimproved supply and availability of goods from the on-board merchants at more \ncompetitive  prices  with  fewer  opportunities  for  island  stores  to  overcharge  for \ngoods between irregular ship calls will assist poor families to get better value for \ntheir low incomes; \n\nimproved shipping for export of produce from the islands to the markets in Majuro \nand  Ebeye  will  enable  outer  island  families  to  increase  their  incomes  and  will \nhelp create more employment opportunities; \n\nimproved  commercial  systems  for  shipping\u2014including  recording  of  cargoes  and \ngoods liability regimes and less loss or damage to perishable and other cargoes \nfrom poor handling facilities at island wharves\u2014will help address problems with \nsecurity  of  cargoes  and  late  payment  and  will  thus  assist  the  poor  to  maximize \nthe  returns  from  their  production;  they  will  also  assist  in  creating  a  better \nenvironment in which private enterprises can be established; \n\nimproved  safety  on  board  ships  from  better  navigation  aids  and  passenger \nfacilities  at  the  embarkation/disembarkation  points  at  the  island  wharves, \nespecially  for  children  and  the  elderly  (fatal  accidents  have  occurred  at  some \ndifficult locations in the past); and \n\nimproved \n\nrunway  maintenance  will  provide \nrunway  extensions  and \ndisadvantaged  outer  island  families  with  (a)  safer,  more  regular,  and  reliable \nflights  to  the  main  centers;  (b)  allow  higher  payloads  and  increased  space  for \nhigh-value  and  perishable  goods;  and  (c)  provide \nimproved  emergency \nevacuation services as required. \n\n\f5 \n\n19. \naccrue: \n\n(i) \n\nSpecifically, in relation to increasing outer island incomes, the following key benefits will \n\nmore  frequent  and  regular  shipping  will  enable  farmers  to  (i)  achieve  a  more \nstable  income  flow  from  more  regular  sales;  and  (ii)  stockpile  their  own  product \nand to sell direct to the agent on the ship rather than to the island buyer, thereby \nreceiving  a  better  \u201cfarmgate\u201d  price.  In  the  past,  irregular  shipping  has  given  the \nisland buyer and the island store operators opportunities for paying lower prices \nto the farmers when cash has been short and credit has been needed; this has \npenalized the poorest parts of the community who have had no access to other \nincome sources; \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\na better farmgate price will increase producer income which, together with better \ncash flows, will reduce the pressure for higher prices; \n\na regular supply of fresh, better quality copra to the oil mill will enable the copra \nprocessing and marketing company, Tobolar, to: (a) obtain a higher oil yield per \nton of copra; (b) produce a higher quality oil, thereby achieving a price bonus for \nbetter color and lower free-fatty-acids in the product; and (c) achieve a lower unit \nprocessing cost per ton of throughput (the mill is presently operating at less than \n50% of design capacity); and \n\na  higher  tonnage  of  product  will  generate  higher  freight  for  the  ship  operators \nboth  directly  and  indirectly  as  the  outer  island  people  will  have  higher  incomes \nand  will  therefore  purchase  more  goods  from  the  on-board  merchants  who,  in \nturn, will pay more freight. \n\n20. \nThe accompanying TA will assist MOTC and AMI in the development and streamlining of \noperational  and  management  information  systems  and  processes.  This  will  include  strategic \nplanning of shipping and aircraft fleet maintenance, retirements, redeployment, and acquisitions. \n \n\n3. \n\nStrategy \n\n21. \nThe ADB country strategy is focused on its overarching goal of poverty reduction. This is \nbeing pursued through the following three-pronged strategy of ADB assistance to the RMI. The \nfirst prong is to support poverty reduction and the creation of new economic opportunities and \nimprove  access  to  basic  social  services  in  the  outer  islands.  The  second  is  to  enhance  the \nenvironment for private sector investment, job creation, and growth.2 The third is to continue to \nstrengthen  public  sector  governance  and  to  enhance  public  sector  productivity  aimed  at \nimproved delivery of public services. \n\n22. \nThe  Outer  Islands  Transport  Infrastructure  Project  is  consistent  with  the  three  prongs, \nfocusing  on  improved  public  service  delivery,  poverty  reduction  in  the  outer  islands,  and \nenhancing  the  environment  for  private  sector  activities.  Furthermore,  by  targeting  the  marine \ntransport  sector  and  related  infrastructure  needs,  the  Project  is  complementary  to  other \nexternally financed activities supporting the improvement of education and health infrastructure \nand  the  development  of  solar  power  facilities  in  the  outer  islands.  It  is  also  directly  linked  to \nADB\u2019s previous TA to the coconut and fisheries sectors. \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002 Country Strategy and Program Update for RMI. Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\nThe Government emphasizes the creation of economic opportunities for the outer island \n23. \ncommunities  as  part  of  the  overall  National  Economic  and  Social  Strategy  (NESS I),  thereby \nreducing the pressures for migration to the already overpopulated centers of Majuro and Ebeye. \nThe Government also emphasizes the need to improve transport to and from the outer islands \nwhile  at  the  same  time  reducing  the  costs  of  transport  subsidies.  However,  given  the \nremoteness of some of the islands, the Government recognizes that some subsidy element may \nneed  to  be  retained  for  social  purposes.  To  this  end,  the  Government  wishes  to  increase \nopportunities  for  private  sector  involvement  in  transport  services,  while  at  the  same  time \nensuring  long-term  sustainability  and  continuity  of  the  shipping  services.  It  is  also  a  specific \ngovernment  objective  that  the  benefits  of  infrastructure  investment  in  the  outer  islands  should \naccrue directly to the outer island communities. \n\nSpecifically,  the  Government\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy  aims  at  (i) developing  regular \n24. \nand  reliable  domestic  air  and  sea  transport  services  with  minimum  government  subsidy  and \nusing  a  private/public  sector  partnership;  (ii) strengthening  government  maintenance  of \ntransport  infrastructure  and  regulation  of  transport  safety,  and  promoting  reliability  of  sea \ntransport  schedules;  and  (iii) encouraging  centralization  of  cargo  at  outer  island  points  of  call \nwhere  this  improves  transport  efficiency  and  service  reliability.  The  external  assistance  to  the \nsector is reported in Appendix 5. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n25. \nThe objective of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction in the outer islands. This \nwill be achieved by (i) improving transport services to and from the outer islands for the people \nand  their  produce,  (ii)  increasing  accessibility  to  goods  and  basic  services,  and  (iii)  creating \nopportunities  for  more  diversified  economic  activities  and  employment.  The  Project  will  help \nreduce the cost of imported goods to outer island communities, increase the opportunity to earn \nincome, create new employment opportunities, and improve access to basic services, such as \nhealth  and  education.  The  Project  will  also  reduce  the  amount  of  subsidy  required  to  provide \nouter island transport services, freeing budget resources for further poverty reduction activities \nand priority sector development, including health and education services. \n \n26. \nSpecifically, the Project will fund selected transport infrastructure, primarily of a marine \ncivil  engineering  nature,  but  also  including  complementary  engineering  and  building  works  on \nland,  that  will  yield  savings  in  transport  costs  and  provide  safer  and  more  reliable  services.  In \nturn,  these  will  encourage  increased  economic  production  in  the  outer  islands,  will  help  limit \nmigration to Majuro and Ebeye, and will assist in the delivery of social programs. \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n27. \n\nThe Project will comprise the following components: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlanding facilities (ship docks, small jetties, and boat channels) to expedite loading \nand  unloading,  and  to  reduce  cargo  spoilage  and  passenger  discomfort  and \ninjury; \n\nwarehousing,  mainly  for  copra,  but  also  for  general  inward  cargo  and  with \nancillary  areas  for  radio  communications,  office,  and  community  workroom;  and \n\n\f7 \n\nimprovement  to  tracks  to  facilitate  concentration  of  copra  collections  and \ndistribution of inward cargo at selected loading points; \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nnavigation aids to enable access to landing points under low light conditions and \nat night, improving safety and eliminating overnight delays; and \n\nextensions  and  general  improvements  to  selected  airstrips  where  there  are \nrunway length constraints. \n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification \n\n1. \n\nLandings \n\n28. \nIn a few places it would be possible to bring inter-atoll ships alongside for direct cargo \nand passenger transfer between ship and shore if a dock was constructed or an existing dock \nextended or repaired. This saves the time required to lighter goods between the ship and shore \non  small  boats,  and  runs  less  risk  of  cargo  damage  through  rough  handling,  or  contact  with \nseawater  or  rain.  It  also  provides  easier  embarkation  and  disembarkation  for  passengers. \nHowever, there are only a few places where there is deep water sufficiently close inshore in a \nprotected situation where docks can be economically built. \n\n29. \nIn a larger number of situations, transfer of cargo has to be by small boat, with the ship \nat anchor or drifting offshore, either in the lagoon or on the ocean side of the land, depending on \naccess to the lagoon, the width of the reef shelf, and weather exposure. Often, cargo transfer is \nrestricted  at  low  tide,  with  4  to  6  hours  of  potential  working  time  being  lost  in  each  tide  cycle \nbecause  of  insufficient  water  depth  for  the  lighters  to  reach  the  beach  or  to  navigate  shallows \nbetween  the  beach  and  reef  edge.  In  some  circumstances  this  situation  can  be  improved \nthrough clearing of a beach channel, in some cases combined with construction of a protective \nbreakwater with the excavated material, and/or with a causeway extending from the beach and \na jetty for small boat use. \n\n2. \n\nWarehouses and Tracks \n\n30. \nCentralization of produce collection to a single location at each island stopping place can \nbe  more  efficient  than  the  ship\u2019s  boats  working  along  the  beach,  collecting  small  amounts  of \nproduce  from  individual  growers.  Successful  centralization  relies  on  a  number  of  conditions, \nincluding  (i) a  good  landing  point  that  is  central  to  the  produce  sources  on  each  side,  (ii) a \ncentral storage facility such as a warehouse, and (iii) a supportive commercial arrangement that \nmakes the centralization effort worthwhile to the grower. In most cases, the natural coral surface \nis  suitable  for  small  pickups  and  handcarts  with  only  clearing  of  vegetation  required. \nOccasionally,  there  will  be  a  need  to  remove  unsuitable  material  and  locally  import  fill  where \nthere  is  an  organic  soil  cover  or  where  the  surface  is  soft  sand.  Otherwise,  formation  and \ncompaction of the surface is all that is required. \n \n\n3. \n\nNavigation Aids \n\n31. \nLit beacons are needed to enable nighttime navigation through main reef passages and \nalong  inner  lagoon  routes.  Beacons,  indicating  the  position  of  the  main  reef  passage  into  the \nlagoon,  are  needed  for  daytime  navigation  at  locations  where  there  are  insufficient  physical \npoints  of  reference  from  the  surrounding  land  above  the  high  water  mark  and  where  the \npassage  is  either  narrow,  branching,  or  bending.  The  unmarked  reef  passages  can  only  be \n\n\f8 \n\nnavigated safely in daylight and, even then, shoals may not be clearly visible if the weather is \novercast or the surface is rough. The primary purpose of lit beacons is, however to provide for \nsafe passage and to save ship\u2019s time by enabling nighttime navigation. These lit beacons would \nbe solar powered to minimize operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n \n\n4. \n\nAirstrip Extensions \n\n32.  Most atolls and islands have airstrips with weekly services, the traffic confined mainly to \nofficial  or  government  passengers  and  higher-income  residents  or  visitors.  Cargo  space  is \nlimited  and,  economically,  only  mail  and  small  high-value  and  light  goods  can  be  transported. \nWhile  complementing  rather  than  competing  with  the  main  seaborne  services,  the  airstrips \nnevertheless  play  an  important  part  in  the  transport  system.  The  work  involves  clearing  or \ntrimming vegetation along the runway and approaches, leveling and compaction of the runway \nstrip,  supply  of  coral  material  from  land-based  sources  for  the  runway  running  surface,  edge \ndelineation, installation of wind sock, and construction of small ancillary buildings. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n33. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $10.0 million  equivalent.  The  foreign \nexchange  cost,  totaling  $6.84 million  equivalent,  constitutes  68.4%  of  the  total  cost,  and  the \nlocal currency cost for expenditures on locally procured items accounts for the remaining 31.6%. \nThe cost estimates include provision for price escalation and physical contingencies and interest \non  the  ADB  loan  during  construction.  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The \ndescription and cost estimates for individual projects are in Appendix 6. \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n \n3.59 \n1.54 \n2.05 \n0.20 \n1.00 \n8.38 \n\n0.77 \n0.76 \n1.52 \n0.10 \n \n10.00 \n\n1.08 \n0.74 \n0.69 \n0.02 \n0.15 \n2.68 \n\n0.23 \n0.25 \n0.48 \n0.00 \n \n3.16 \n\n2.51 \n0.80 \n1.36 \n0.18 \n0.85 \n5.70 \n\n0.54 \n0.51 \n1.04 \n0.10 \n \n6.84 \n\n \n\nItem \n\n1.

The Borrower will be the \nRMI. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nForeign \n6.84 \n0.00 \n   6.84 \n\nLocal \n0.16 \n3.00 \n   3.16 \n\nTotal \n7.00 \n3.00 \n10.00 \n\n \n\nSource \nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Execution \n\n35.  MOTC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project.  The  secretary,  MOTC,  will \nassume overall responsibility for the implementation of the Project and for liaising with ADB. To \nmanage day-to-day implementation, MOTC will establish a project office to be headed by a full-\ntime project manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to ADB. The office will be \nadequately  staffed  at  all  times  with  a  competent  project  manager,  project  accountant,  and \nsupporting personnel to undertake day-to-day activities such as recruitment and supervision of \nconsulting services, procurement of goods and services, contract management, accounting and \ndisbursement,  records,  and  reports.  The  project  office  will  be  in  operation  before  loan \nnegotiation  and  until  December  2006,  which  is  a  few  months  after  the  Project\u2019s  expected \nphysical  completion  date.  MOTC  will  be  assisted  by  consultants  in  preparing  engineering \ndesigns,  supervising  construction,  and  technical  review.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nappointed by February 2003. A contract under a single contract arrangement for the civil works \nis expected to be awarded by October 2003. \n\n36. \nInternational  consultants,  who  will  be  engaged  by  MOTC,  will  manage  the  site \ninvestigation  contract,  undertake  conceptual  design  and  tender  preparation  for  the  main \ncontract, evaluate bids and make recommendations to MOTC and ADB on contractor selection, \nand supervise construction. \n \n37. \nIt is proposed that a project coordination committee be formed to facilitate exchange of \ninformation  on  the  progress  of  the  Project.  The  committee  would  include  representatives  of \nMOTC, as well as the ministries of Finance, Public Works, Internal Affairs/ Historic Preservation \nOffice,  Research  and  Development,  the  Marshall  Islands  Airport  Authority  (MIAA),  the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Authority  (EPA),  the  mayors  and  local  government  councils  of  the \n\n                                                 \n3   The  RMI  uses  the  US  dollar  as  its  currency.  \u201cLocal  currency  costs\u201d  in  this  context  mean  costs  of  goods  and \nservices  that  are  procured  locally.  Because  of  the  structure  of  the  RMI  economy,  such  costs  have  a  substantial \nimport component, and therefore a high indirect foreign exchange cost. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nislands concerned, and other government and nongovernment organization (NGO) personnel as \ndesirable. The committee would meet quarterly and on an ad hoc basis. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n38. \nThe Project is expected to start in January 2003 and to be completed by 31 December \n2006.  The  implementation  schedule,  showing  the  various  stages  of  the  Project,  is  provided  in \nAppendix 7. The length of the construction period is partly determined by weather conditions as \nwell as by the widely dispersed sites. The planned commencement of construction is during the \nfourth quarter of 2003 with completion by the end of 2006. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n39. \nAll  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  In  view  of  the  small  number  of  domestic  civil  engineering  contractors,  it  is \nanticipated  that  the  Project  will  be  let  as  a  single  major  construction  contract  of  about \n$7.2 million  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  a  two-stage  bidding  procedure,  to \nprovide  a  contract  of  sufficient  size  to  encourage  competitive  tendering  from  overseas \ncontractors,  preferably  in  association  with  local  contractors.  This  single  contract  would  cover \ndocks, navigation aids, warehouses, channels, and airstrips.  \n\n40. \nThere  will  be  an  opportunity  for  suitably  qualified  local  construction  firms  to  either \npropose  a  joint  venture  with  international  firms,  act  as  subcontractors,  or  bid  for  the  main \ncontract. Subpackages of the main contract will include the design and construction of some of \nthe  navigation  markers,  clearing  and  maintenance  of  airstrips,  and  supply  of  some  of  the \nhardware to be fitted to the upgraded and new structures. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n41. \nAn international engineering firm will be engaged to act as engineer to the contract and \nto carry out design, preparation of tender documents and advertising of tenders, bid evaluation \nand  monitoring  of  the  site  investigation  works,  and  the  main  construction  contract.  A  site \ninvestigation  contract  will  be  let  in  advance  of  the  main  contract  and  prior  to  the  engineering \ndesign. Submarine archaeological surveys will be conducted during this period in areas where \nthere is expectation of submarine artifacts of historic value. \n\nA full technical proposal will be used. The consultants will be selected through the quality \n42. \nand  cost-based  selection  method.  It  is  estimated  that  about  75  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (43 for international and 32 for domestic consultants) will be required over the project \nperiod. The consulting firm is expected to provide secretarial and project accounting services on \nan intermittent basis over the construction period, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n\n43. \nADB  has  approved  advance  action  to  expedite  the  recruitment  of  the  international \nconsultants.  Contracts  with  the  consultants  will  be  entered  into  as  soon  as  the  loan  becomes \neffective.  ADB  has  informed  the  Government  that  advance  action  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinance the Project or any part of it. \n\n\f11 \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement \n\n44. \nThe  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \ndated  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  For  the  international  consulting  services, \ndirect payment procedures will be used. \n \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition \n\nThe  Project  involves  modification  to  areas  below  the  high  water  mark  within  the  outer \n45. \nreef  of  each  island  or  atoll.  These  areas  are  seaward  extensions  of  the  land  ownership \nboundaries or weto. Land is also required for construction of warehouses and, in a few cases, \nfor  development  of  tracks.  Warehouses  would  be  located  on  land  that  is  currently  clear  of \nbuildings and none of the proposed works would involve resettlement. Furthermore, the Project \nhas a dozen reserve subprojects (Appendix 6) to replace subprojects if land issues emerge. \n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit \n\n46. \nThe  Government  has  undertaken  to  make  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  project  implementation.  MOTC  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly \nreports  covering  physical  progress,  project  accounts,  and  performance  indicators.  To  facilitate \npostevaluation of the Project, MOTC will provide ADB with a completion report, within 3 months \nof  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  on  the  execution  and  initial  operation  of  the  project \nfacilities, including the costs and compliance with the loan covenants. \n\n47.  MOTC  will  maintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records,  and  will  provide  ADB \nannually with audited accounts and financial statements related to the Project. The statements \nwill  be  audited  by  independent  auditors,  presented  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  and \nsubmitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The terms of reference for the \nindependent  auditor  will  be  subject  to  review  and  approval  by  ADB.  A  midterm  review  is \nenvisaged after 2 years to verify the status of the Project, its achievements against the program, \nand its costs against the budget. \n \n\n8. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n48. \nThe Government has agreed to undertake, with assistance from the consultants, benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation activities to ensure that the facilities to be improved under the Project \nare managed efficiently and that their benefits are maximized. The Government and ADB have \nagreed on the nature of the data to be collected, the methodology for analysis, and the reporting \nrequirements;  these  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Performance  Management  System \n(Operations Manual 22, August 2002). \n \n\n9. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\n49. \nThe responsibility for management and O&M of the project components will be assigned \nunder  the  pertinent  line  agencies  immediately  after  completion  of  the  Project.  These  agencies \nare  MIAA  (airstrips),  MOTC,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  and  the  Marshall  Islands  Ports \nAuthority  (MIPA)  (wharves).  It  is  envisaged  that  an  outer  island  infrastructure  levy  applied  to \ninter-atoll  shipping  on  ships  docking  at  Majuro  and  Ebeye,  collected  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment  by  MIPA,  will  be  used  to  fund  maintenance  of  marine  infrastructure  and  product \ncentralization  facilities  such  as  warehouses  and  tracks,  while  a  surcharge  on  domestic \n\n\f12 \n\npassenger  fares  would  be  levied  for  airstrip  maintenance.  The  Government  has  adopted  a \npolicy of engaging the private sector for maintenance of government assets. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n50. \nA  TA  grant  of  $250,000  is  attached  to  the  loan.  The  TA  will  assist  MOTC  and  AMI  in \nimproving  the  delivery  of  sea  and  air  transport  services  by  developing  their  business, \noperational, and management information systems and practice, and in the long-term planning \nof  their  fleet  maintenance,  disposals,  and  acquisitions.  The  TA  will  also  assist  MOTC  in  its \nadministration  of  private  sector  contracts  for  shipping  services,  and  in  the  operation  of \ngovernment  shipping.  Consultants  for  the  nonlending  assistance  will  be  selected  through  the \nquality and cost-based selection method. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $315,000 \nequivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $235,000. ADB will provide the TA as a grant \nfinanced  by  the  ADB-funded  TA  program  to  cover  the  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $15,000  of \nthe  local  cost  component.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $65,000.  The  details  of \nthe TA are in Appendix 8. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\nto \n\nrisks \n\nrelate \n\nTechnical \n\n(i) constructability, \n\n51. \nrequirements,  and \n(iii) extraordinary  damage  from  cyclone  or  tsunami  events.  The  technology  for  onshore  works \n(warehouses,  track  improvements,  airstrip  extensions)  is  straightforward  and  within  the \ncapability  of  small  contractors  or  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  assuming  appropriate \nengineering specifications and levels of supervision. Marine works carry more risk with regard to \nfounding conditions for docks and jetties (investigation has been restricted to visual observation \nand simple soundings in the project preparatory TA), and littoral transport of sediment (although \nthis is mitigated by specifying open structure).4 \n\n(ii) maintenance \n\n52.  Where  isolated  cargo  transfer  platforms  on  the  ocean-side  reef  edge  have  been \nproposed,  there  is  a  greater  risk  in  construction,  maintenance,  and  operation  of  the  facility. \nThere  may  be  a  need  to  substitute  another  project  should  the  design  stage  site  investigation \nreveal  problems  that  render  the  proposal  technically  or  economically  infeasible.  Provision  has \nbeen made for a number of fully appraised back-up subprojects should this eventuality occur. \n\n53. \nAll ocean-side structures and all navigation aids will be susceptible to damage or loss in \nthe  event  of  a  major  cyclone  event  or,  for  shore  structures,  a  large  tsunami.  The  RMI  has  a \nrelatively low, but not negligible, risk of cyclone events. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Aspects \n\nThe financial and economic benefits of the project rely partly upon the savings that are \n54. \ngenerated  by  improved  scheduling  and  fewer  delays  due  to  tide,  weather,  and  daylight \nconditions,  being  translated  into  improved  ship  utilization,  lower  shipping  costs,  and  more \nregular and reliable ship calls. To the extent that these occur, the benefits of the Project will be \n\n                                                 \n4  Littoral drift is the movement of sediments caused by wave action along the coastline. On an open coast, a jetty\u2019s \nstructure extends into a body of water, and is designed to prevent such build-up of littoral materials in a channel. \n\n\f13 \n\ncaptured by the outer island population. This flow of benefits to the outer island people will also \nrely  upon  the  responsiveness  of  freight  rates  and  fares  to  these  lower  costs,  and  the \nGovernment passing on part of its cost savings to the users of the service. \n\nThe competitive franchise system for shipping operators and the performance reporting \n55. \nregime proposed for the government shipping service together should reduce the risks of project \nbenefits  not  being  achieved;  the  proposed  nonlending  assistance  is  designed  to  reinforce  the \ninstitutional capacity to perform these tasks. \n\n56. \nThere  have  been  past  experiences  of  warehouses  remaining  unused  due  to  uncertain \nownership  status  and  management  responsibility.  The  Project  will  address  this  problem  by \nestablishing clear ownership of the warehouses (MOTC is the proposed owner), with the ability \nto contract management to local government or the private sector as circumstances permit. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty Intervention and Social Impact \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Intervention \n\n57. \nThe  outer  island  communities  are  the  people  whose  incomes,  livelihood,  quality  of  life, \nand access to services and to greater economic opportunities stand to be most affected by the \nProject. Where docks, jetties, and beach channels are contemplated, the sites of these facilities \nare  either  already  in  customary  use  for  a  similar  purpose  or  are  in  new  locations  that  are \nexpected to find agreement with the customary owners of land and the coastal zone. \n\nAt the national level, while the RMI has a relatively high per capita income owing mainly \n58. \nto the historically high levels of financial assistance from the US, outer island populations have \nsignificantly  lower  incomes  than  either  the  urban  centers  or  the  islands  in  receipt  of \ncompensation payments. Outer islands also have relatively few cash income opportunities, are \nvulnerable to natural disasters, and are disadvantaged through their isolation. One of the main \ncriteria for project selection has been the destination islands\u2019 relative lower income. The islands \nselected  by  the  Project  have  a  weighted  average  share  of  households  with  an  annual  cash \nincome lower than $1,000 ($0.38 per capita per day) of 37.8%, and a weighted average share of \nhouseholds  with  an  annual  income  lower  than  $3,000  of  44.3%,  against  13.6%  and  27.5%, \nrespectively,  for  the  whole  of  the  RMI.5  For  the  nonproject  islands,  the  respective  figures  are \nonly  3%  below  $1,000  and  10%  below  $3,000.  This  clearly  demonstrates  the  relative  poverty \nexperienced in the islands of the project area. \n\n59. \nThe  Project  will  assist  in  reducing  isolation  and  lowering  transport  costs,  which  are \namong  the  necessary  conditions  for  increased  economic  participation  of  relatively  poor \nhouseholds.  The  cash  income  activities  of  the  poor  that  will  benefit  from  the  Project  include \ncopra  production,  fresh  fish  marketing,  surplus  island  produce  marketing  (e.g.,  pumpkins, \nbreadfruit,  melons,  bananas),  and  sale  of  handicrafts.  Through  reductions  in  ship  operating \ncosts,  the  Project  will  help  lower  passenger  fares  and  freight  rates,  which  will  increase \ndisposable  incomes  for  poor  outer  island  residents  as  well  as  induce  additional  economic \nproduction.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  9,  and  more \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n\n60. \nIt has been clearly established that regular and reliable transport services for all forms of \nproduce,  general  import  cargo,  and  passengers  is  a  key  need  to  support  the  social  and \n\n                                                 \n5  1999 Population and Housing Census. \n\n\f14 \n\neconomic  welfare  of  remote  and  poverty-stricken  island  populations.  On  the  more  productive \natolls supporting larger populations, a four to six-week frequency of service is desirable whereas \nthe service over the recent past has been 4 months or longer and erratic. From analysis of past \ncopra  production,  cargo  volumes,  and  passenger  records,  it  is  clear  that  there  is  a  latent \ndemand for an improved level of service. \n\n61.  More frequent and reliable transport services will assist in: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nimproving  access  for  the  remote  households  to  all  potential  pro-poor  basic \nservices  through  (a)  easier  travel  and  transport  to  and  from  the  islands  by \nMinistry  of  Internal  Affairs  mobile  teams,  health  and  education  personnel,  and \nother  officials  for  training,  performance  monitoring,  and  public  awareness;  (b) \neasier access for supplies of materials and drugs to schools and clinics; and (c) \nreliable transport for schoolchildren traveling back and forth for the holidays; \n\nenhancing the opportunity for new ventures to be developed by poor households \nin  the  knowledge  that  transport  will  be  available  to  ship  produce,  goods,  and/or \npeople in and out on a more regular basis; \n\nreducing the middleperson\u2019s rent and allow higher assigns for the farm producers \nand lower prices for the poor consumers in the outer islands; \n\nimplementing  other  pro-poor  development  projects,  e.g.,  outer  island  education, \nhealth,  and  energy  sector  projects,  through  improved  shipping  services  for \ntransporting materials and skilled staff; \n\nproviding  a  greater  selection  of  store  goods  at  more  competitive  prices  for \npeople; \n\nproviding  a  lifeline  service  to  outer  islands,  since  the  poor  households  cannot \nafford  airfares,  and    any  delay  or  interruption  to  shipping  services  places  lives \nand livelihoods at risk; \n\nslowing  the  decline  in  atoll  populations,  many  of  them  marginally  viable  even \nnow, and with increasing levels of dependency; and \n\nincreasing  opportunities,  especially  for  the  poor,  vulnerable  youth  for  which  the \nlack  of  opportunities  would  otherwise  drive  poor  younger  people  away  from  the \nouter islands in search of jobs. \n\n2. \n\nSocial Impact \n\n62. \nSocial  Services.  The  proposed  Project  addresses  some  important  concerns  of  those \nministries  responsible  for  essential,  pro-poor  social  services  and  outer  island  development, \nparticularly the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health. \nThese  ministries  require  regular  contact  with,  and  travel  of  staff  to,  the  outer  islands  for  the \ndelivery  and  monitoring  of  social  services.  The  implementation  of  these  projects  will  be \nfacilitated by better transport services for the shipment of materials and personnel. \n\nGender  Issues.  Men  of  working  age  tend  to  look  for  job  opportunities  in  Majuro  and \n63. \noverseas. Women tend to remain in the outer islands to look after the elderly and the younger \npopulation,  thus  increasing  the  women\u2019s  workload  in  the  household  as  well  as  in  cash-\n\n\f15 \n\ngenerating activities. There is a division of labor between men and women in island subsistence \nand  income-generating  activities  of  the  poor.  Women  and  men  both  participate  in  copra \nproduction  and  the  cultivation  of  produce  for  sale  in  Majuro  and  Ebeye.6  Women  produce \nhandicrafts,  and  men  are  responsible  for  fishing.  The  Project  will  facilitate  supply  of  goods \n(mostly food) and provision of better basic services for women and the vulnerable groups in the \nouter  islands.  There  are  no  sociocultural  groups  in  a  vulnerable  position  in  the  context  of  the \nProject, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples will not be triggered by the Project. \n\nCash-Earning  Activities.  Construction  and  maintenance  of  project  infrastructure  will \n64. \ncreate  some  cash-earning  activities  for  the  poor  in  the  outer  islands.  The  transport \nimprovements  will  provide  increased  opportunities  for  participation  in  cash  income  production \nthat will benefit the poor in the outer islands. \n\n65. \nEducation Issues. The subdistrict centers of Jaluit and Wotje support high schools and \ndraw  their  students  from  within  the  subdistricts,  including  neighboring  atolls,  setting  up  a \ndemand for passenger transport at the start and end of each semester. Schools require inputs \nof  educational  materials  on  a  regular  basis  and,  occasionally,  building  materials.  Improved \ntransport  will  allow  greater  contact  with  the  isolated  schools,  thereby  helping  raise  standards \nthrough more frequent teacher training and performance monitoring. \n\nHealth  Issues.  There  are  54  health  centers  spread  through  the  islands  of  the  project \n66. \narea,  each  staffed  with  a  health  assistant.  At  present,  none  of  these  centers  has  cold  chain \nfacilities. The health assistant provides only basic health care services and none of the centers \nis equipped to handle surgery or inpatient treatment. The lack of refrigeration and problems with \nshipping  and  transport  generally  often  mean  that  clinics  run  out  of  pharmacy  medicines  and \neven  primary  health  care  is  not  available  or  is  unsatisfactory.  At  present,  the  difficulties  in \ntransport mean that only the most serious cases are taken to Majuro or Ebeye for emergency \ntreatment.  This  means  that  the  treatment  is  often  too  late,  causing  additional  suffering  and, \nisland  patients.  Transport  requirements  of \nsometimes,  unnecessary  deaths \ndispensaries  include  airfreight  of  pharmaceuticals  and  fragile  medical  equipment,  and  sea \nfreight of bulky, lower-value and more robust supplies and building materials. More regular and \nreliable  transport  will  improve  lifeline  services  for  the  outer  islands  and  will  reduce  the  risk  of \nunnecessary  deaths  in  cases  where  urgent  treatment  is  required.  Infections  with  human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are increasing \nrapidly  in  the  Pacific.  The  construction  workers  associated  with  the  Project  are  a  potential \nsource of transmission for HIV/AIDS to the RMI. To reduce the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS, the \ncontractor  will  be  required  to  provide  HIV/AIDS  education  and  condoms  to  the  construction \nworkers. \n\nto  outer \n\n67. \nResettlement Issues. The Project will have no direct resettlement effects. In the longer \nterm,  successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  assist  in  reducing  the  drift  of  population  to \nMajuro  and  Ebeye  through  improvement  of  the  opportunities  in  the  outer  islands  for  cash-\nincome  employment  and  reduction  in  the  sense  of  isolation  and  unreliability  of  transport  links. \nBefore the final list of subprojects is prepared for tendering, on-site investigations will be carried \nout  for  each  subproject  to  ascertain  that  no  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  involved.  In  the \nevent  that  a  proposed  subproject  is  found,  during  site  investigation,  to  involve  involuntary \nresettlement, it may be replaced with a subproject that will be subject likewise to the same on-\n\n                                                 \n6  The men collect coconuts, while both men and women are involved in husking, shelling, and drying. Men dig the \n\nland while women are involved in planting and harvesting the produce. \n\n\f16 \n\nsite screening process that will not involve involuntary resettlement. MOTC will be responsible \nfor screening the subproject and for obtaining clearance from appropriate agencies and parties. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Assessment \n\n68. \nFull recovery of the capital costs of the Project from user fees is probably unrealistic in \nview of the limited financial resources of outer island communities. The Government has offered \nto  budget  $50,000  per  year  for  the  Project\u2019s  O&M  and  to  finance  any  shortfall  of  funds. \nFurthermore, the new financial provision of the Compact Agreement with the United States will \nprovide for a trust fund specifically earmarked for infrastructure O&M. However, there should be \nprovision to at least provide a revenue stream that covers the ongoing O&M costs of the Project. \nIt  is  envisaged  that  the  project  infrastructure  will  be  owned  by  MOTC  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment, and that MOTC will be responsible for allocating funds to maintain the facilities in \noperational condition. \n \n69. \nIt seems impractical to collect revenue from cargo interests or passengers at the outer \nisland ports but, as most inter-atoll shipping originates at Majuro or Ebeye, a levy at these ports \nof  origin  is  proposed  as  a  means  of  funding  maintenance  requirements.  It  is  further  proposed \nthat MIPA act as a collection agent for MOTC in return for an administration fee. The levy would \nprobably be on a ship call and/or cargo and passenger throughput basis with the aim of being \nrevenue neutral (i.e., the levy adjusted annually to reflect the medium-term maintenance funding \nneeds). \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\n70. \nThe economic evaluation of the proposed Project is based on a comparison of the \u201cwith\u201d \nand  \u201cwithout\u201d  project  scenarios.  The  components  of  the  Project  are  integrated  and  mutually \ncomplementary. Providing better navigation aids and marks is insufficient on its own since the \nbenefits of easier access to lagoons provided by the navigation aids can only be realized in full if \nthe vessels can approach closer to shore through cleared passages or come alongside to the \nisland wharves. \n\n71.  Without  the  Project,  the  inter-atoll  shipping  services  will  continue  to  be  subject  to \nnighttime navigation and tidal restrictions that delay or interrupt vessel passage between ports \nof  call,  and  which  cause  delay  or  damage  to  cargo  transfer  at  ports  of  call.  Incomes  for  outer \nisland families, being largely dependent on selling produce when the ship calls, will continue to \nbe  irregular  and  uncertain  making  household  budgeting  difficult,  especially  in  respect  of \npayments  of  large  items  such  as  school  fees.  Opportunities  for  increasing  production  will  be \nseverely constrained. Store good prices will continue to be high as there will be no competition, \nand choice and availability of goods will be limited. Access to basic services will continue to be \nrestricted, families will not be able to improve their living standards, poverty will get worse, and \nthe poorest families in the country will be further disadvantaged. \n\n72.  With the Project, most of these constraints will be overcome. Delays and interruptions to \nservices will be reduced, such that savings can be made in ship operating costs and services \nprovided with fewer vessels. In this case, it has been assumed that redundant vessels would be \nsold  or  deployed  elsewhere.  A  case  may  also  be  made  for  savings  from  the  reduced  risk  of \nvessels  going  aground  and  suffering  damage  or  loss.  Where  the  Project  allows  ships  to  lie \nalongside, there are savings in cargo damage from rough handling and water damage. Finally, \nthe  reliability  will  induce  increased  economic  activity  and  incremental  transport  demand.  It  will \nenable  families  to  increase  their  production  and  generate  regular  and  increased  incomes  with \n\n\f17 \n\nwhich  they  will  be  able  to  improve  their  conditions  and  standards  of  living  and  to  meet  vital \nperiodic payments such as school fees. \n\n73. \nThe  evaluation  has  been  carried  out  over  a  20-year  investment  period  which  generally \ncorresponds  to  the  design  life  of  the  navigation  marks  (25  years  for  civil  works  and  five  to  10 \nyears  for  lights),  the  jetties  (25  years  for  good  maintenance,  15  years  for  poor  maintenance). \nThe Project achieves a 14.5% economic internal rate of return. The sensitivity analysis, given in \nTable  3,  demonstrates  that  the  Project  is  robust  and  remains  financially  viable  even  with \nadverse movements in some parameters such as lower project benefits, increase in capital cost, \nand delay in project implementation. \n\nSensitivity Test \n\nBase Case \n  10% increase in costs \n  10% decrease in benefits \n  1 year delay in construction \n  All tests combined \n\nTable 3: Sensitivity Test \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n14.5 \n13.0 \n13.0 \n14.2 \n11.3 \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n \n-1.02 \n-1.02 \n \n\n \n\nNPV \n($ million) \n1.33 \n0.58 \n0.53 \n1.12 \n(0.40) \n\nSensitivity \nIndicator \n \n-5.61 \n-6.01 \n \n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n74. \nThe Project will contribute both directly and indirectly to poverty reduction in the project \nareas.  The  discounted  cash-flow  analysis  indicates  that  a  total  of  around  one  third  of  the \naverage annual benefits will accrue directly to the people of the outer islands through (i) better \nmarket  access  and  increased  incomes  from  local  produce  sales  (10%  of  total  benefits); \n(ii) passenger  time  savings,  increased  safety,  and  less  cargo  damage  (25%  of  total  benefits); \nand  (iii) income  earned  from  employment  during  project  implementation.  Less  cargo  damage \nwill also benefit merchants, the public, and ship operators. Reduced operating costs, accounting \nfor  around  half  of  the  total  benefits,  will  accrue  directly  to  ship  operators  and  to  government \nthrough reduced operating subsidies. Outer island communities will benefit indirectly through (i) \nlower  real  fares  and  cargo  charges;  (ii)  lower  prices  for  store  goods  from  on-board  merchants \nresulting from increased competition; and (iii) less risk of stock loss and damage through poor \nhandling. \n\n75.  Many  unquantifiable  benefits  accruing  to  the  outer  island  communities  have  not  been \nincorporated into the cash-flow analysis. In particular, these are the social and welfare benefits \nto  be  derived  from  (i) improved  access  to  medical,  education,  public  awareness,  and  other \ngovernment  service  teams;  (ii) easier  and  more  frequent  interaction  with  other  parts  of  the \ncountry;  and  (iii) better  outer  island  project  implementation,  as  supplies  and  technical  support \ncan more easily be sent to project sites. The economic analysis is given in Appendix 10. More \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\n76. \nThe  EPA  is  the  agency  charged  with  environmental  reporting  and  clearance  of \nengineering  works.  The  Project  is  classified  Category  B,  and  an  initial  environmental  impact \nexamination  was  completed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Impact  Assessment \nGuidelines  for  Infrastructure  Projects  and  the  requirements  of  government  legislation  and \nthe  Coastal \nregulations,  specifically \n\nthe  National  Environmental  Protection  Act  1984; \n\n\f18 \n\nConservation  Act  188  (Section  27);  and  the  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Regulations, \n1994, issued by the EPA.  \n\nThe nature and scale of the works proposed are generally judged to be of relatively low  \n\n77. \nenvironmental impact, for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nworks that have the potential to set up high water velocities through constriction \nof  flow,  or  connection  of  water  bodies  with  significant  hydraulic  gradients,  have \nbeen avoided; \n\nprojects  are  mainly  sited  at \nfor \npassenger/cargo  vessels,  and  therefore  are  already  subject  to  minor  levels  of \npollution (pristine locations have been avoided in most cases); and \n\nlocations  already  used  as \n\nlandings \n\nthe extent of coastline modification is very small in comparison with the coastline \nlength,  and  works  are  situated  either  where  there  are  high  rates  of  water \nexchange  and  flushing  within  lagoons  or  on  the  ocean-side  where  the  reef \nshelves quickly to deep water. \n\n78. \nEffects on coral reef systems will be minimized by designing minimal footprint structures \nwhere possible (e.g., cantilever piles instead of mass gravity structures for reef pass navigation \naids),  utilizing  existing  channel  locations  where  possible,  limiting  excavation  and  deposition \nwork  on  the  seabed  to  a  minimum  (breakwaters  have  not  been  pursued  for  this  reason),  and \nrequiring  contractors  to  implement  a  construction  and  environmental  management  plan.  The \nsummary initial environmental examination is given in Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nOverall Assessment \n\nTransport services serve as the lifeline to the outer islands. Shipping brings in essential \n79. \ngoods  and  services  and  takes  out  island  produce  from  which  the  people  earn  a  substantial \nportion of their incomes. Shipping also brings in government services and supplies, particularly \nto  the  schools  and  health  clinics.  Shipping  provides  an  essential  service  to  families  by \ntransporting children to and from secondary schools and colleges elsewhere in the RMI, and in \nproviding  links  for  everyone  to  the  urban  centers  and  the  outside  world.  Air  services  provide \npassenger and freight transport as well emergency evacuation services for sick and vulnerable \npeople. \n\n80. \nThe  major  risks  associated  with  project  implementation  and  subsequent  realization  of \nproject  objectives  include  failure  of  the  Government  to  implement  an  efficient  system  of \ncontracted  shipping  services  or  to  optimize  the  size  and  number  of  vessels  in  service.  Other \nrisks include failure to implement a satisfactory system for funding maintenance of the Project \nand  prudent  and  timely  allocation  of  the  revenue  for  maintenance  operations  when  required. \nThere are some risks that elements of the infrastructure, in particular the proposed warehouses, \nwill  be  unused  due  to  lack  of  satisfactory  local  management  and  commercial  arrangements. \nThere  are  also  risks  of  vandalism,  neglect,  or  diversion  for  other  purposes  of  detachable  and \nmobile  equipment  provided  for  the  project  (e.g.,  navigation  lights).  The  project  design \nincorporates  safeguards  to  minimize  these  risks.  Furthermore,  lending  (of  which  the  project \nimplementation  consulting  services  terms  of  reference  are  found  in  Appendix  12)  and \nnonlending technical assistance will assist the implementation of the Project. \n\n\f19 \n\nThe civil works under the Project for the most part involve improvement to outer island \n81. \nlandings  that  are  already  utilized  by  inter-atoll  shipping  and  in  most  cases  have  already \nintroduced  some  physical  modification  to  the  natural  environment.  Where  beach  channels  are \nprovided,  in  several  cases,  this  involves  the  widening  and  deepening  of  an  existing  channel. \nSimilarly, most of the jetty facilities comprise repair or extension to existing structures. For those \ncases  where  physical  modification  is  proposed  at  new  sites,  the  initial  environmental \nexamination  has  concluded  that  none  of  the  project  components  will  involve  major  adverse \nenvironmental effects. \n\n82. \nNotwithstanding ADB\u2019s internal requirements for environmental assessment, many of the \nsubprojects  will  require  environmental  permits  from  the  EPA  under  the  RMI\u2019s  environmental \nlegislation. By law, this environmental analysis must be undertaken by specialists independent \nof the project designers and constructors. Provision has been made in the project costs for the \nengagement of a specialist consultant to undertake this work. \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n83. \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  Government  will  finance  any  shortfall  of  funds,  after  the  collection  of  user \nlevies, to ensure effective and efficient O&M of the Project over its economic life \nof 25 years. \n\nThe Project will be implemented in accordance with existing environmental laws, \nregulations, and standards of the RMI, and ADB's guidelines, in particular, ADB's \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the subprojects do not result in any losses that \nwould trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Before tendering of the \ncivil work contract, on-site investigations will be carried out for each subproject in \norder  to  ascertain  that  no  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  involved.  In  the  event \nthat  a  proposed  subproject  is  found,  during  site  investigation,  to  involve \ninvoluntary resettlement, it will be replaced with a subproject that will be subject \nlikewise  to  the  same  on-site  screening  process  and  that  will  not  involve  any \ninvoluntary resettlement. MOTC will be responsible for the subproject screening \nand for obtaining clearance from appropriate agencies and/or parties. \n\nThe  Government  will  maintain  a  dialogue  with  ADB  on  the  status  of  relevant \ntransport  issues,  including  maritime  safety,  tariffs,  and  user  charges,  sector \nfunding, institutional organization, and external assistance. \n\nThe  Government  will  budget  adequate  counterpart \nfor  project \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  the  financing  plan,  as  well  as  an  annual \nappropriation of $50,000 for the O&M of the Project\u2019s

Project, for $600,000, was approved \non 11 March 1994. \n \nThe  project  report  submitted  in  August  1995  gave  recommendations  for  investment  in \nmarine,  road  and  air  transport  infrastructure,  mainly  for  main  port  and  airport  works. \nIncluded  were  outline  recommendations \ninfrastructure \nimprovements. A project loan was not proceeded with at that time as the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) was undergoing a period of economic transition as a result of the \nimminent  cessation  of  United  States  government  Compact  Agreement \nfinancial \nassistance and Asian Development Bank (ADB) efforts at that time were directed toward \nimproving fiscal management capacity. \n \nTA 2756-RMI, Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector, for $575,000 approved \non  8  September  1995,  oversaw  the  formation  in  1997  of  two  self-funding  government \nauthorities,  the  Marshall  Islands  Port  Authority  (MIPA)  and  the  Marshall  Islands  Airport \nAuthority (MIAA), and a road trust fund for road maintenance cost recovery. \n \nLoan  1513-RMI,  Public  Sector  Reform  Program,  for  $12.0 million,  was  approved  on  30 \nJanuary 1997. \n \nTA 2994-RMI, Coconut Sector Development Strategy, for $70,000, was approved on 10 \nMarch  1998,  copra  being  the  main  export  product  from  the  outer  islands.  The  report \nendorses the private sector shipping franchise scheme. \n \nAn extension to TA 2756-RMI provided assistance on the design and implementation of a \ncompetitive  shipping  franchise  scheme,  resulting  in  the  award  of  a  contract  to  a  private \nsector operator commencing in October 1999. \n \nTA 3506-RMI, Preparing the Outer Island Transport Infrastructure Project, for $340,000, \nwas approved on 29 September 2000.  \n\nThe  TA  commenced  in  May  2001  and  a  draft  final  report  was  submitted  in  November \n2001.  Tripartite  meetings  were  held  in  July  and  December  2001.  A  list  of  outer  island \ntransport infrastructure works was agreed, from which a project of value $10 million would \nbe drawn. \n \nA  fact-finding  mission  for  the  proposed  loan  project  was  fielded  in  December  2001.  A \nmemorandum of understanding signed by the Minister of Transport and Communications \nagreed  on  the  scope  of  the  Project  and  a  series  of  policy  actions  to  be  taken  prior  to \nmanagement review and loan negotiation. \n\nThe 2002 country programming mission reviewed the progress on policy actions since the \nfact-finding  mission.  While  progress  had  been  made  on  institutional  development,  on \nlimiting  prices  charged  for  merchant  goods,  and  on  providing  a  rotation  of  shipping \nservices  between  the  government  and  the  private  sector  operators,  there  had  been  no \naction  on  inviting  interest  or  developing  contract  conditions  for  a  new  round  of  private \nsector  shipping  service  franchises.  Agreement  was  reached  on  a  revised  program  for \nthese and other actions. \n\nExpressions  of  Interest  called  from  private  operators  for  tendering  to  supply  shipping \nservices at the end of the existing contract period \n\nMarch 1994 \n \n \nAugust 1995 \n\nSeptember 1995 \n \n \n\nJanuary 1997 \n\nMarch 1998 \n\nJune 1999 \n\nSeptember 2000 \n \n \nNovember 2001 \n\nDecember 2001 \n\nApril 2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJune 2002 \n\nManagement review meeting for the Project. \n\nAugust 2002 \n\nAppraisal mission. \n\n\fPROBLEMS/CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS \n \n \n \n\nIncome poverty on \nouter islands \n\nLess public sector \nbudget support \navailable for other \ngovernment programs\n\nPoverty of opportunity \nand lack of access to \nservices on the outer \nislands \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n \nPROBLEMS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIMMEDIATE \nCAUSES \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSECONDARY \nCAUSES \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONTRIBUTING \nCONSTRAINTS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nHigh costs and few or \nsingle suppliers of \nimported goods; \nlimited market access \nfor sale of island \nproduction; limited \ndiversification \nopportunity \n\nSEA TRANSPORT \nShipping services \ninefficient and not cost\neffective; irregular and \nunreliable services; \ninfrequent and long \npassages for \npassengers \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE \nMany ports of call; no \nnavigation aids; limited \nand sometimes unsafe \nlandings; inadequate \nstorage and \ndistribution \n\nNATURAL SYSTEMS \nTidal, weather, and \ndaylight constraints on \naccess by sea \n\nGovernment subsidies \nto shipping, aviation, \nand copra price \nsupport while world \nprices low \n\nGEOGRAPHIC \nWidely dispersed atolls \nand islands with long \nocean crossings and \nsmall populations \n\nLimited opportunity \nand high cost of \nextending social and \neconomic development \nservices; limited social \ncontact with \nMajuro/Ebeye \n\nAIR TRANSPORT \n \nLow capacity and high \ncost of air services; \nsome service \ndisruptions \n\nINFRASTRUCTURE \nLarge number of \nairstrips poorly \nmaintained; occasional \nclosures; runway \nlength restrictions on \nservices in some \ncases \n\nLANDFORM \nLimited land area on \nislets and length for \nairstrip construction \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nSector Description \n\n1. \n\nTransport Planning and Coordination \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\n1. \nSeveral  government  agencies  and  special  purpose  authorities  share  responsibility  for \nthe transport sector. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is formally at \nthe apex of transport administration but does not have any responsibilities with regard to roads \nand  road  traffic.  Its  planning  role  is  limited  to  ports  and  shipping  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  civil \naviation.  Its  policy  formulation  role  is  relatively  small.  Essentially,  MOTC  is  responsible  for  the \nregulation of domestic and overseas shipping, organization of the operation of the government \nshipping fleet, and regulation of air safety through the Department of Civil Aviation. Road traffic \nregulation  and  fire  services  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Commissioner  for  Public  Safety. \nKwajalein  Atoll,  although  subject  to  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (RMI)  government \nadministration,  in  practice  maintains  a  high  degree  of  autonomy,  with  Kwajalein  Atoll \nDevelopment Authority and the Ebeye Port Commission having significant roles in the transport \nsector. \n\n2. \nTransport  infrastructure  is  provided  and  maintained  by  the  Marshall  Islands  Port \nAuthority  (MIPA)  and  the  Marshall  Islands  Airport  Authority  (MIAA)  in  respect  of  main  ports \n(Majuro,  Ebeye,  and  Jaluit)  and  Amata  Kabua  International  Airport  (Majuro).  Outer  island \nairstrips and roads are built and maintained by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) while outer \nisland  marine  infrastructure  construction  is  undertaken  by  the  private  sector,  under  written  or \nunwritten  contracts,  directly  to  government  agencies  such  as  the  Marshall  Islands  Marine \nResources Authority (MIMRA) or the local government. \n \n\n2. \n\nTransport Infrastructure \n\na. \n\nPorts \n\n3. \nOperation of the main ports is now the responsibility of MIPA, the result of restructuring \ninitiatives  recommended  and  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  MIPA  controls \nthe operation of Delap and Uliga ports on Majuro, Jabwor port on Jaluit Atoll and, nominally, of \nthe port of Ebeye. Apart from the MIMRA fishing jetties, outer island jetties and landings are not \nunder  any  formal  control  with  regard  to  their  operation  or  maintenance,  although  local \ngovernment councils have a natural interest in the adequacy of the facilities provided. \n\n4. \nMIMRA  operates  fish  bases,  some  with  jetties  or  pontoons,  funded  by  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  over  a  10-year  period  at  Arno  Atoll  (Ine  and  Arno),  Likiep, \nAilinglaplap  Atoll  (Buoj),  Namu  Atoll,  and  Aur  Atoll  (Tabal).  A  new  facility  is  soon  to  be \nconstructed at Maloelap Atoll (Taroa). The facilities provided vary but can include a building with \nchiller room, office, and equipment store. At Arno, Ine, Buoj, and Likiep there is a jetty for small \nboats to carry local fish catch to Majuro or Ebeye and, in some cases, a smaller jetty for use by \nlocal fishermen has been provided but apparently never used. Namu has a pontoon, while Tabal \nhas no jetty and the facility planned for Tabal is similar. \n\n5. \nApart from the MIMRA jetties and the dock at Jabwor, the outer atolls generally have no \nother jetties or beach ramps to support passenger and cargo movements. Exceptions are Bikini, \nEnewetak,  and  Rongelap  where  there  has  been  substantial  new  construction  as  part  of  the \nrehabilitation of these atolls and preparation for rehabilitation by the displaced former residents \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nand their descendants. There are a few locations where wartime jetties and seaplane ramps are \nusable or could be made usable. \n \n\nb. \n\nShipping \n\n6. \nShipping  is  the  dominant  mode  of  transport  between  the  main  centers  and  the  outer \natolls.  Historically,  MOTC  operated  three  Micro  class  passenger  cargo  vessels  of  56  meters \nlength that were part of a larger fleet distributed among the United States former trust territories \nat  the  time  of  independence.  These  vessels  were  phased  out  of  operation  between  1995  and \n1998. The service was supplemented by a new vessel in 1996, the Juk Ae, which operated until \nit was lost in 1998, and by a larger sister ship the Ribuuk Ae in 1996 which is still in service, but \nwhich was under repair between 1998 and January 2001. \n\nFollowing  recommendations  of  an  ADB-funded  TA  project,1  MOTC  contracted  Pacific \n7. \nInternational Inc. to operate a cargo/passenger service to a group of atolls for a three-year term, \nusing  the  Mercy  K,  a  42  meter  dredger  converted  to  carry  cargo  and  passengers,  which \ncommenced service in October 1999. This was supplemented by the Ministry of Resources and \nDevelopment\u2019s landing craft Jeljelet Ae chartered by MOTC from June 2000 to January 2001. \n\nIn  early  2001,  under  Taipei,China  funding,  MOTC  acquired  three  vessels  to  provide  a \n8. \nthe  Landrik  and  Litakbouki,  both  general \ngovernment  shipping  service.  These  are \npassenger/cargo vessels and the Jobake, a small tanker vessel. The first two vessels, together \nwith  the  Ribuuk  Ae,  since  returned  to  service,  are  intended  for  deployment  on  contracted \nservices  to  private  operators,  which  together  with  the  service  provided  by  the  Mercy  K,  will \nprovide  a  comprehensive  service  to  most  atolls  and  islands.  The  operators  have  all  been \nselected  and  are  Marshall  Islands  trading  companies.  A  smaller  passenger  cargo  vessel,  the \nBokenieb,  is  intended  to  be  run  as  a  government-operated  service  to  the  more  outlying  and \nsmaller  population  atolls  in  the  Western  region.  This  vessel  was  transferred  to  MOTC  by  the \nMarshall  Islands  Development  Bank.  Some  minor  modifications  have  been  made  under \nTaipei,China funding. \n \n\nc. \n\nCivil Aviation \n\n9. \nAMI is the only domestic carrier and has a fleet of two Dornier 228 twin engine turboprop \naircraft (approximately 10 years old), together with a BN Islander which it acquired in 2000 but \nwhich has yet to be brought into service. The Dorniers are at a stage where they require heavy \nmaintenance so that they can continue in service, and the company expects that this will give an \nexpected further economic life of 10 years. The Dorniers fly domestic sectors mainly at a weekly \nfrequency,  apart  from  Kwajalein  (5  days  a  week)  and  Jaluit  (twice  a  week),  together  with  a \nweekly  service  to  Tarawa  (Kiribati).  The  Director  of  Civil  Aviation  reports  to  the  secretary  of \nMOTC and is responsible for aviation regulation and safety. \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\nThere  is  no  current  formal  statement  of  government  policy  in  the  transport  sector. \n10. \nHowever,  the  following  general  policy  principles  for  national  development,  for  the  transport \nsector and in relation to the outer islands appear to be accepted. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1995.

In such a \nsituation the Government\u2019s move to acquire new vessels and lease these to the private sector is \na rational one, in that it allows smaller companies to enter the market without having to face the \nlarge  capital  outlay  of  vessel  purchase.  However,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  such \narrangements do not advantage operators who lease back a government vessel over those who \nsupply  their  own.  It  is  likewise  important  that  other  agencies  of  government  do  not  operate \nsubsidized shipping services in the franchise area, if the scheme is to succeed. \n\n15. \nAnother  aspect  of  the  shipping  franchise  service  that  requires  review  is  the  creation  of \nlocal  monopolies  where  a  single  operator  is  contracted  to  service  an  island  group  over  a  full \nthree-year contract period and the monopoly position this can create in the supply of imported \nmerchandise.  This  is  particularly  so  when  the  shipping  operator  is  also  a  local  merchant \ncompany. Rotation of service areas is a way of avoiding this tendency, and the tendering should \nbe broadened to include overseas operators. \n \nD. \n\nAsian Development Bank Sector Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n\n16.  With Japanese assistance in the road sector and proposed assistance from Taipei,China \nfor improving airport and aviation related infrastructure, ADB is focusing its attention on the port \nsector in the outer islands and related infrastructure needs of the outer islands. Such a strategy \navoids duplication and is directly linked to ADB\u2019s support to the coconut and fisheries sectors. \nThis is consistent with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy by improving infrastructure in the more \nvulnerable outer islands. \n\n17. \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  has  covered  (i) investment  priorities  and \npoverty  focus,  (ii) creation  of  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the  domestic \nshipping  service,  (iii) institutional  strengthening  within  MOTC  for  shipping  service  operational \nand  financial  management,  and  (iv) cost-recovery  principles  and  mechanisms.  An  action  plan \nwas agreed for implementation prior to loan approval. \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Priorities and Poverty Focus \n\n18. \nThe  priorities  of  the  Government  are  to  return  the  benefits  of  the  infrastructure \ninvestment to the outer islands. Project benefits will accrue directly to the users of the transport \nservices  in  the  form  of  time  savings,  improved  regularity  and  reliability,  safety  in  embarkation/ \ndisembarkation,  and  reduced  cargo  damage.  However,  the  larger  portion  of  benefits  arise  as \nsavings in ship delay that must be allowed to flow through into a smaller shipping fleet and/or \nincreased  services  if  these  benefits  are  to  be  captured.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  operating \nefficiencies  will  be  wasted  on  additional  slack  time  in  port,  particularly  if  there  is  limited \ncommercial discipline in the operation of the service. \n\n19. \nPolicy dialogue with the Government has focused on ensuring, first, that project benefits \nare captured and, second, that the benefits are passed on to the inhabitants of the outer islands. \nEnsuring  the  efficiency  of  the  shipping  operation  and  flexibility  to  adapt  to  changing  market \nconditions  is  recognized  as  being  essential  to  the  former  objective,  and  a  system  of \nperformance  monitoring  and  target  setting  is  to  be  introduced  for  the  government  shipping \noperation.  This  will  include  a  start-of-year  \u201cstatement  of  intent\u201d  prepared  by  the  shipping  unit \nwithin  MOTC  in  which  the  performance  indicators  and  targets  for  the  year  will  be  agreed  with \nthe Minister, and an end-of-year \u201cstatement of service performance\u201d that reports on the degree \nof achievement of the targets and corrective actions where problems have been encountered.  \n\n20. \nNavigation Aids. Apart from some existing navigation marks for the main reef passages \ninto  Majuro  and  Kwajalein  Atolls,  there  are  very  few  navigation  aids  for  inter-  and  intra-atoll \nshipping. A lack of navigation aids limits ship passage in many places to favorable tide, weather, \nand  daylight  conditions.  Construction  of  solar-powered  lit  beacons  at  the  main  reef  passes, \nwithin the lagoons, and at landing points will enable substantial savings in ship operating time \nand  either  a  reduction  in  the  fleet  size  required  to  service  the  islands  or  an  increase  in  the \nservice frequency, or both. \n\n21. \nDocks,  Jetties,  and  Boat  Channels.  These  facilities  will  be  improved  at  a  number  of \nlocations  where  large  volumes  of  produce  and  passengers  are  loaded,  or  where  there  are \nsubstantial concentrations of population that are difficult to service because of tidal restrictions. \nOften up to six hours, or half of the tidal cycle, is lost because the water depths are too shallow \nfor small boats to carry cargo or passengers between ship and shore. Another factor is weather, \nand  locations  facing  the  easterly  quarter  and  unprotected  by  land  can  be  difficult  to  access \nbecause of wave action. The solutions to these problems are to excavate small boat channels \nacross reef flats, to build ship docks or boat jetties, or combinations of these according to the \nnature of the site.  \n\n22. \nThe  largest  time  savings  can  be  achieved  by  building  a  ship  dock  at  which  the  larger \ninter-atoll  vessels  can  berth  and  transfer  passengers  and  cargo  directly  to  land,  thereby \navoiding the need to use small boats. There are a few locations where existing jetties that have \nbeen damaged, become silted, or were constructed originally for shallow draught boats, could \nbe repaired and/or extended to enable the jetty to be returned to use, or to allow larger vessels \nto lie alongside. \n\n23.  Warehousing. Concentration of cargo to a single point, where a dock, jetty and/or boat \nchannel  is  provided,  allows  copra  and  other  produce  to  be  accumulated  prior  to  ship  arrival, \nrather  than  putting  ashore  for  small  quantities  at  many  locations  which  is  costly  on  ship  time. \nThis requires warehouse storage, which can also be used for essential goods, and can house \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nother  community  facilities,  such  as  communications  equipment  and  workrooms.  A  supportive \nsystem for ownership, management, and upkeep of each warehouse is also required. \n\n24. \nTracks.  Unpaved  roadways  are  useful  in  some  locations  to  enable  small  pickup \nmovement of passengers, produce, and other goods to the centralization point. In most cases, \nsome form of track already exists and all that is needed is some clearing and building up of the \nrunning surface with naturally occurring coral from sources on land. \n\nAirstrip Extensions. The Project includes a small number of airstrip extensions where \n25. \naircraft  currently  have  to  operate  at  reduced  payload,  where  there  is  traffic  and  development \npotential, and where the extensions can be made at modest cost and without adverse social or \nenvironmental effects. \n \n\n2. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation in Domestic Shipping \n\n26. \nExperience in the past has been that government-provided shipping has imposed a high \ncost  on  the  MOTC  budget,  for  several  reasons:  (i) higher  wage  rates  for  public  sector \nemployees  and  little  incentive  for  improved  labor  productivity,  (ii) ships  of  a  size  and \nconfiguration that are not well suited to the service and that are expensive to run, (iii) diversion \nof  ships  from  their  service  schedule  by  government  direction,  and  (iv) difficulty  in  mobilizing \ncash for payment of operating expenses or for periodic maintenance. \n\n27. \nThe thrust of advice from ADB technical assistance over a 6-year period has been that \nthe Government should exit from shipping operations altogether and, where necessary, provide \nfor  noncommercial  services  to  the  outer  islands  through  a  competitively  bid  private  sector \nfranchise  scheme.  Practical  experience  with  such  a  system  has  shown  that  it  does  work  in \npractice  but  that  the  tender  conditions  may  be  in  need  of  refinement  and  there  may  be  a \nshortage  of  interested  private  sector  bidders,  although  this  may  be  more  due  to  the  private \nsector\u2019s distrust that government will not unfairly compete than a true absence of interest. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening within MOTC \n\n28.  MOTC  is  in  the  process  of  reorganizing  its  internal  structure  and  capacity  for  shipping \nservice operational management. It has established the shipping operation as an individual unit \nwithin  the  Ministry  with  all  functions  carried  out  internally.  It  has  been  agreed  with  MOTC  that \nthe  possibilities  for  efficiently  outsourcing  shipping  operational  functions  such  as  the  booking \nsystem and financial accounting should be reviewed, prior to loan approval. \n\n29. \nSystems for recording ship movements, cargo and passenger volumes, and associated \npayments  are  still  under  development.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  has \nrecommended  the  form  of  operational  data  collection  and  monitoring  that  is  required,  both  for \nmanagement  information  and  for  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  the  required  systems \nwill be progressively developed to a tested operational condition before loan approval. \n \n\n4. \n\nCost-Recovery Principles and Mechanisms \n\n30. \nADB  has  discussed,  with  the  Government,  the  establishment  of  a  trust  account  from \nwhich,  as  a  minimum  objective,  the  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  of  the  maritime \nand  associated  onshore  infrastructure  would  be  met.  A  more  desirable  objective  would  be  full \nrecovery of capital and O&M costs over the economic lifetime of the assets. The trust account \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nwould receive revenue from transport user levies, supplemented if necessary from government \nfunds. \n\n31. \nIt  is  anticipated  that  the  account  would  be  held  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  the \nrevenue  collected  by  an  agent,  such  as  the  Bank  of  Marshall  Islands  or  MIPA,  with  funds \ndisbursement  authorized  against  a  program  of  maintenance  needs  and  tendered  rates \nsubmitted by the responsible government agency. Ownership of the maritime assets would be \nvested in a government agency, such as MIPA, which would be responsible for drawing up an \nannual maintenance program. Ownership of the copra warehouses could be vested in MOTC, \nwhich would assume similar responsibilities. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\nAsian Development Bank Country Lending and Technical Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  11  loans  totaling  $71.125 million  to \n1. \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) since it joined ADB in April 1990. Of these, seven are \ncomplete, and the remaining loans are under implementation; Ebeye Health and Infrastructure \nis  due  for completion in 2002. Technical assistance (TA) grants totaling $19.585 million for 40 \nTAs  have  been  provided  as  of  December  2001.  ADB  has  provided  two  sectorwide  advisory \ntechnical assistance projects to the transport sector, the Transport Infrastructure Development \nProject (TIDP) and Institutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector (ISTS). \n \n\nTable A5: List of Asian Development Bank Loans to the Republic of the Marshall Islands \n\nDate of Board \nApproval \n\nLoan Amount \n($ million) \n\n \n\nLoan \nNumber \n \n1102 \n1218 \n1249 \n1250 \n1316 \n1389 \n1513 \n1694 \n1791 \n1828 \n1829 \n \n\nProject Name \n\n \nFisheries Development \nEmergency Typhoon Rehabilitation Assistance Program \nBasic Education Development \nMajuro Water Supply \nHealth and Population \nMajuro Water Supply and Sanitation \nPublic Sector Reform Program \nEbeye Health and Infrastructure \nSkills Training and Vocational Education Project \nFiscal and Financial Management Program \nFiscal and Financial Management Program \nTotal \n\n \n26 Sep 1991 \n28 Jan 1993 \n9 Sep 1993 \n9 Sep 1993 \n22 Sep 1994 \n29 Sep 1995 \n30 Jan 1997 \n12 Aug 1999 \n29 Nov 2000 \n7 Jun 2001 \n7 Jun 2001 \n \n\n6.950 \n0.500 \n8.000 \n0.700 \n5.700 \n9.200 \n12.000 \n9.250 \n6.825 \n4.000 \n8.000 \n71.125 \n\n1. \n\nTransport Infrastructure Development Project \n\nAsian Development Bank Transport Sector Lending and Technical Assistance \n\n Source: Loan, TA, and Equity Approvals Database, ADB. \n \nB. \n \n \n \nThe  TIDP1  TA  proposed  a  10-year  infrastructure  development  program  for  road,  sea, \n2. \nand air transport, together with proposals for policy and institutional change in the sector. The \ninfrastructure investment projects were focused on the main ports of Majuro and Ebeye and the \ninternational airport at Majuro, and were aimed at rehabilitation, repairs, and limited upgrading. \nA  small  program  of  investment  in  outer  islands  infrastructure  was  also  recommended.  The \nproposed  loan  project  did  not  proceed  due  to  the  fiscal  crisis  experienced  by  the  RMI  in \n1996/97,  to  which  the  ADB  responded  by  forming  a  policy  advisory  team  and  a  public  sector \nreform program loan.2 \n \n3. \nThe  policy  and  institutional  review  under  the  TIDP  recommended  the  establishment  in \npractice of the Marshall Islands Port Authority (MIPA), a new Marshall Islands Airport Authority \n(MIAA), each of which was to be a self-financing, government-owned, commercial enterprise. A \ndedicated road maintenance fund was also recommended. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1994.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  for  the  Transport  Infrastructure \n\nDevelopment Project. Manila. \n\n2  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands for the Public Sector Reform Program. Manila. \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n2. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of the Transport Sector \n\nThe  TA  recommended  that  the  Government  introduce  a  shipping  franchise  system, \n4. \nwhereby  private  sector  operators  would  tender  for  fixed-term  service  contracts  in  return  for \npayment  from  Government,  with  the  bidder  requiring  the  lowest  payment  being  awarded  the \ncontract. This was proposed as a method of reducing the cost burden of the domestic shipping \nservice on the public sector budget, while at the same time opening up new opportunities for the \nprivate sector to engage in the domestic shipping market. \n \n \n \n5.  \nThe  ISTS  provided  TA  for  the  establishment  of  MIPA,  the  legal  basis  for  which  was \nalready  in  existence  but  had  not  been  implemented.  Assistance  was  given  in  establishing  a \nconstitution  and  board  of  directors,  drafting  a  corporate  plan,  transferring  assets  and  liabilities \nfrom MOTC, and developing port management systems and a staff training program. Formation \nof MIPA removed the commercial functions of port ownership and operation from the policy and \nplanning  role  of  MOTC.  MIPA  was  expected  to  finance  its  operations  from  user  charges, \nremoving this cost from the public sector. \n \n6.  \nEstablishment of MIAA was on similar principles but required new legislation, which was \nduly  enacted.  MIAA  was  encouraged  to  be  self-funding,  although  this  was  likely  to  be  more \ndifficult than for MIPA, in view of the heavy asset reinvestment program required in future years. \nThe third element of the TA was a road trust fund to collect road user revenues and apply these \nto  road  maintenance  and  traffic  enforcement,  again  with  the  objective  of  removing  costs  from \nthe public budget. All three of these project components were successfully completed. \n \nAn  extension  to  the  ISTS  provided  assistance  to  MOTC  in  setting  up  the  shipping \n7.  \nfranchise  scheme  in  1998,  with  tenders  invited  within  the  RMI.  Two  bids  were  received,  one \nbidder  providing  its  own  vessel  and  the  second  bidder  offering  to  use  one  of  the  government \nvessels. The second offer was not taken up as the government vessel became unserviceable at \nthe time. A mixed system of the private sector franchise operator on one service route and the \ngovernment shipping service on other routes has operated since 1999. \n \nC. \n \n8.  \nThe RMI has received recent external assistance from Japan and Taipei,China for road \nand  airport  development.  Repaving  of  Majuro  main  road  was  funded  under  Japan  grant \nassistance, while Taipei,China funded the paving of Majuro secondary urban roads, completed \nin 2001. Taipei,China has also provided grant assistance to the Marshall Islands Development \nBank  used in part to purchase three new interisland ships, two passenger/cargo vessels, and a \nsmall  fuel  tanker.  Taipei,China  has  also  provided  grants  of  $100,000  to  each  island  local \ngovernment  council  which,  in  some  cases,  has  also  been  used  for  vessel  purchase. \nTaipei,China is also expected to be a source of grant funding for airport extensions and paving \nat the subdistrict centers of Jaluit and Wotje. Finally, a United States Department of Agriculture \ncommunity facilities grant has funded the purchase of small pickup trucks for the outer islands \nand two school buses for Majuro and Ebeye, at $140,000 in FY2001. \n\nOther External Assistance to the Transport Sector \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n\n \n1. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $10.0 million  equivalent.  The  foreign \nexchange  cost,  totaling  $6.84 million  equivalent,  constitutes  68.4%  of  the  total  cost,  and  the \nlocal currency cost for expenditures on locally procured items accounts for the remaining 3.16%. \nThe cost estimates include provision for price escalation and physical contingencies and interest \non the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan during construction. \n\n \nTable

\nSource: Preparing the Outer Island Transport Infrastructure TA final report.  \n \n3. \nThe cost estimates allow for establishment of 40% of the base cost of construction. This \nhigh establishment figure is due to the remote and widely dispersed nature of the construction \nwork  and,  in  the  case  of  marine  works,  periods  when  construction  will  not  be  possible  due  to \nsea conditions. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $7.0 million equivalent to finance 100% of the \n4. \ntotal foreign exchange cost and 5.06% of the local currency cost; and the Government will fund \n94.94% of the local currency cost.1 The proposed ADB loan, from the Special Funds resources, \nis proposed to have a maturity period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will \n                                                 \n1  The  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  uses  the  US  dollar  as  its  currency.  \u201cLocal  currency  costs\u201d  in  this  context \nmeans costs of goods and services that are procured locally.

A concept paper for the TA was attached to the MOU. \n \n3. \nThe TA is included in the project framework in Appendix 1. The proposed assistance is \nincluded in the 2003\u20132004 pipeline and would be implemented in parallel with the Outer Island \nTransport Infrastructure Project. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe  RMI's  many  small  and  widely  dispersed  outer  island  communities  are  served  by \nsubsidized shipping services operated partly by the Government and partly under private sector \ncontracts.  AMI,  which  is  government  owned,  operates  small  aircraft  to  outer  island  airstrips. \nThese  remote  communities  have  limited  resources  and  experience  poverty  of  opportunity  and \nrelative  income  poverty  from  their  isolation.  The  transport  services  are  critically  important \nlifelines  but  impose  a  large  burden  on  public  finances,  which  the  Government  is  willing  to \nsupport, but which needs to be contained. \n \n5. \nIn 1999, following advice and assistance from ADB, the Government issued tenders for \nprivate  sector  operation  of  shipping  services  under  a  subsidized  competitive  franchise \narrangement.  One  contract  was  entered  into  with  a  private  operator  who  supplied  his  own \nvessel, while a second contract was not taken up due to unavailability of the government vessel \nthat  was  to  have  been  made  available  under  lease.  Subsequently,  the  RMI  was  gifted  three \nvessels by Taipei,China, which it has operated in parallel with the private sector contracts. \n \nWhile  greatly  improved  from  before  1999,  there  are  problems  with  the  current \n6. \narrangement, both with aspects of the private operator\u2019s contract conditions and performance, \nand  with  the  Government's  own  shipping  operations.  On  the  private  sector  side  these  include \noverly  high  prices  for  goods  sold  from  the  ship  at  outer  islands,  the  standard  of  passenger \nfacilities,  and  the  maximum  freight  rates  charged,  which  are  viewed  as  too  high.  On  the \nGovernment's side there are concerns about the cost of the service stemming partly from a fleet \nthat  is  probably  too  large,  slow  turnaround  and  slack  time  in  port,  insecure  provision  for  ship \nmaintenance,  and  no  long-term  fleet  planning.  The  Government  also  needs  to  develop  its \nshipping, commercial, operating, and management information systems to efficiently perform its \nown functions and to monitor the private sector contracts. \n \n7. \nAMI  is  a  small,  undercapitalized,  government-owned  airline,  and  provides  the  only  air \nservices  to  the  outer  islands  using  two  aging  Dornier  228  turboprop  aircraft,  which  have \nexperienced considerable downtime and which are due for major overhaul. The air links to the \nouter islands are important lifelines for government administration, and for social and economic \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n1. \n\na. \n\nPurpose \n\nPurpose and Output \n\nThe Proposed Technical Assistance \n\ndevelopment.  The  airline  faces  strategic  decisions  on  its  future  fleet  and  operational  planning, \nand its business systems and management need to be streamlined. \n \nC. \n \n \n \n \n \n8. \nThe Project will complement the accompanying loan, the purpose of which is to improve \nthe  efficiency  and  reliability  of  outer  island  transport  through  selected  physical  infrastructure \nimprovements\u2014navigation  aids,  wharves  and  jetties,  warehouses,  track  improvements,  and \nairstrip extensions. \n \n9. \nThe Project will assist the Government in the financial and operational management of \ninterisland  shipping  and  air  transport,  including  private  sector  participation,  to  achieve  more \nfinancially sustainable and cost-effective services at lower levels of subsidy, releasing funds for \nother social and economic programs. It will assist the loan project achieve its economic rate of \nreturn objectives by encouraging better fleet configuration and utilization and in taking maximum \nadvantage of the efficiency gains provided by the infrastructure improvements. \n \n \n \n10. \n \n\nGovernment shipping service and private sector shipping contracts: \n\nExpected Results \n\nb. \n\n \n\nfurther  development  of  the  management  information  systems  needed  to  enable \nthe  MOTC  shipping  operation  to  function  as  an  efficient  government-owned \nenterprise; \nimplementation  of  systems  for  operational  monitoring  of  shipping  contracts  and \nMOTC's shipping operation; and \nimproved long-term fleet management. \n\nan assessment of the market position and strategic outlook for the airline; and \nreview  and  improvement  of  the  airline's  operational  management,  and  financial \naccounting and commercial systems. \n\n \n\nc. \n\nDeliverables \n\nThese include: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreports on project performance and baseline report on benefit monitoring for the \nOuter Island Transport Infrastructure Project; \nannual statements of intent and statements of service performance for the MOTC \nshipping operation, and improved annual reports for AMI; \nnew  and  improved  business  and  information  systems  for  the  MOTC  shipping \noperation and AMI; \nlong-term  plan  for  utilization,  maintenance,  disposal,  and  replacement  of  the \ngovernment shipping fleet; and \na strategic plan for the future direction of AMI. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAMI: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n11. \n \n\n \n \n12. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n3. \n\n2. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nA budget of $250,000 is proposed from ADB resources.

There are six other inhabited islands not included \nin  the  project  area  as  these  are  either  in  receipt  of  special  compensation  funds  (Kili,  Bikini, \nRongelap, and Enewetok) or are the major urban centers (Majuro and Kwajalein). The islands in \nthe project area itself have also been analyzed in relation to their proximity to Majuro since this \nprovides  a  focal  point  for  transport  and  markets.  The  six  closest  islands  are  Arno,  Mili,  Jaluit, \nAur,  Jabat,  and  Ailinglaplap;  these  are  referred  to  as  the  \u201ccloser  islands.\u201d  The  remaining  13 \nislands in the project area are the \u201cdistant islands.\u201d \n \n2. \nThe  primary  target  group  is  the  population  of  the  19  outer  islands  of  the  project  area. \nThese account for 30% of the total population. The people of the outer islands have the lowest \nincomes in the country (two thirds of the population in the project area, the beneficiaries, have \nan  income  level  below  $1  per  day)  and  least  access  to  basic  services  and  economic \nopportunities. Nearly all households on these islands are semi-subsistence and low income, and \nare  considered  poor.  The  few  households  not  considered  poor  are  those  with  a  wage-earning \nmember,  almost  all  of  whom  are  government  employees.  Improvements  to  the  transport \ninfrastructure,  and  thus  to  transport  services,  will  benefit  the  poor  outer  island  people  directly. \nThe improvements will also bring indirect benefits to all the people in the country, as transport \nservices  cover  all  islands  and  general  efficiency  gains  will  be  enjoyed  by  all  transport  users. \nFurthermore, improved transport will bring benefits to all the people of the country by increasing \ntransport  costs  and  subsidies  as  well  as  allowing \nbudget  resources, \nimprovements  to  service  delivery,  which  could  be  used  to  further  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment programs. \n \nThe target group comprises all relatively poor households, all of whom are current and \n3. \npotential  users  of  transport  services,  and  are  reliant  on  essential,  pro-poor  social  and \ndevelopment  services  provided  by  others  who  are  the  direct  users  of  transport  services,  and \nhouseholds and businesses that could benefit or be adversely impacted by changes in access \nto, from, and around the outer islands. Subgroups among the target population are: \n \n\nthrough \n\nlower \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsocial  and  community  services  and  private  households  in  respect  of  building \nmaterials, fuel, and other supplies; \nthe population of the outer islands as consumers of imported staple foods such \nas rice, flour, and sugar; \npassengers  to,  from,  and  between  the  outer  islands,  including  school  children; \nand \nconsignees of fish, island produce, and handicrafts for sale in Majuro and Ebeye; \nand copra growers and traders. \n\nPoverty Status of the Outer Islands \n\n \nB. \n \n4. \nHealth.  All  outer  islands  have  a  dispensary  (health  clinic);  on  the  atolls,  this  is  usually \nlocated at the main center of the atoll group. Although it was noted during the consultation visits \nthat  some  dispensaries  have  not  been  completed  (Jabat,  Buoj  on  Ailinglaplap,  and  Bikirij  on \nArno). There are 54 health centers spread through the islands of the project area, each staffed \nwith  a  health  assistant.  At  present,  none  of  these  centers  has  cold  chain  facilities,  although  a \nUnited Nations project is about to provide solar power for lighting, refrigeration, water pump, and \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\nradio  to  11  of  the  centers.  The  health  assistant  provides  only  basic  health  care  services  and \nnone  of  the  centers  is  equipped  to  handle  surgery  or  inpatient  treatment.  The  lack  of \nrefrigeration and problems with shipping and transport generally often mean that clinics run out \nof  pharmacy  medicine  and  even  basic  treatment  is  unavailable  or  unsatisfactory.  At  present, \nwith  the  difficulties  in  transport,  only  the  most  serious  cases  are  taken  to  Majuro  or  Ebeye  for \nemergency treatment; consequently treatment is often too late causing additional suffering and, \nsometimes, unnecessary deaths to outer island patients. \n \nRelative  poverty  is  indicated  by  the  fact  that  less  than  1%  of  the  households  in  the \n5. \nproject area have piped water compared to a quarter of those in other parts of the country. In \nthe project area, wells or rain catchments are the principal sources of water, and these are both \nsusceptible to contamination. In respect of sanitation facilities, 58% of households in the project \narea either have no toilet facilities or use pit latrines. This compares to only 18% in the rest of \nthe country. The poor sanitation and lack of guaranteed safe water are a primary cause of the \nhigh level of diarrheal diseases reported in the outer islands. Diabetes, measles, hypertension \nand,  most  recently,  tuberculosis  are  among  the  other  most  prevalent  diseases  reported  in  the \nproject area. \n \n6. \nInfrequent and unreliable transport means that even when medical teams go to the outer \nislands  they  are  often  unable  to  undertake  all  the  treatment  required  in  the  time  available \nbetween  island  stops  and  individual  voyages.  The  Ministry  of  Health  is  hoping  to  overcome \nsome  of  these  problems  by  supporting  a  proposal  for  a  medical  mission-sponsored  mobile \n\u201chospital ship\u201d which will tour the outer islands providing regular medical and surgical services \nand specialist dental and eye care. The operation and safety of this vessel, which is expected to \nbe  staffed  by  volunteers  and  funded  by  US  charities,  will  be  greatly  facilitated  by  the \nimprovements to island transport infrastructure under the Project. \n \n7. \nEducation.  All  outer  islands  have  primary/elementary  schools.  Only  three  of  the  outer \nislands  have  secondary  schools\u2014Ailinglaplap  (private),  Jaluit  (public),  and  Wotje  (public). \nSecondary education is organized on a regional basis, with students traveling to and from the \nhigh schools where they board for the school year. This sets up a peak in the demand for sea \ntransport  between  the  home  island  and  the  islands  with  high  schools.  Irregular  and  unreliable \nshipping  therefore  causes  inconvenience  and  family  disruption  when  children  are  stranded  at \nholiday times. \n \n8. \nThe  literacy  rate  for  the  outer  islands  as  a  group  was  reported  as  95%  in  the  1999 \ncensus compared with 97% in the RMI. Ailuk and Lib have much lower literacy rates with 85% \nand  89%,  respectively.  Aur,  Lae,  Likiep,  and  Mejit  on  the  other  hand  recorded  the  highest \nliteracy rates at 99%, a higher rate than that for the RMI as a whole. \n \nThree percent of the outer island population have not received any education. Mejit and \n9. \nUtirik  have  twice  this  rate  with  6%  of  their  populations  not  completing  education  at  any  level. \nAbout  a  quarter  of  the  population  had  attained  a  Grade  8  education,  the  equivalent  of \ncompletion  of  primary  or  elementary  school.  This  figure  is  higher  in  Lib  and  Moloelap,  with  a \nthird of the population of each island attaining education to Grade 8 level. \n \n10. \nFifteen  percent  of  the  population  completed  Grades  9  through  11  (secondary  or  high \nschool) with a range across the outer islands from 9% (Jabat and Lae) to 17\u201319% (Ailinglaplap, \nEbon,  Jaluit,  and  Wotje).  The  higher  figures  recorded  in  Jaluit  and  Wotje  are  unsurprising \nconsidering the location of public high schools at these two subregional centers. Mejit is the only \nisland in the project area that records more than 10% graduating from high school (Grade 12). \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9  \n\nFor  all  other  of  the  outer  islands  between  3%  (Ailuk  and  Namdrik)  and  8%  (Ebon,  Jabat,  and \nJaluit)  had  graduated  from  Grade  12.  Ujae  was  the  only  island  that  did  not  record  anyone \ngraduating from high school. Less than 1% of the population had attained a tertiary degree or \nqualification. \n \n11. \nHousehold Facilities. There is a general pattern of relative poverty or disadvantage for \nhouseholds in the islands of the project area in relation both to those in the nonproject islands \nand the overall national averages. Within the project area itself there is also a pattern of relative \ndisadvantage between the six islands closest to Majuro (Arno, Ailinglaplap, Aur, Mili, Jabat, and \nJaluit) and the 13 more distant islands. This is primarily a reflection of their proximity to Majuro \nand the more frequent transport services provided by small private vessels. \n \nLess  than  1%  of  households  in  the  project  area  own  any  form  of  motorized  vehicle \n12. \nalthough  handcarts  are  more  common.  Not  surprisingly,  ownership  of  canoes  is  more \nwidespread  with  28.7%  of  households  reporting  ownership.  This  compares  with  a  national \naverage of 16.3% ownership. Within the project area, 30% of the households in the \u201cclose six\u201d \nowned canoes compared to 27.5% of those in the \u201cdistant 13.\u201d While none of the households on \nLib and only 10.2% of those on Wotje reported canoe ownership, some 59% of households on \nLae had canoes. \n \n13.  With  41%  of  households  in  the  project  area  not  owning  a  radio,  compared  to  28% \nnationally,  considerable  importance  is  attached  to  the  visits  of  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs \nmobile teams and their awareness and public education programs. In the distant islands, almost \n45% of households are without radios compared to 37% of those closer to Majuro. Lib, followed \nby Ailuk, are the most disadvantaged islands with 86.7% and 70.5% of households respectively \nnot having a radio. In contrast on Namdrik only 20.3% are without radios. \n \n14.  Water  and  Sanitation.  Water  and  sanitation  facilities  are  also  areas  of  poverty  and \ndisadvantage  for  the  outer  islands  and  this  is  reflected  in  the  high  incidence  of  diarrheal \ndiseases.  In  the  project  area,  58%  of  households  are  without  proper  toilet  facilities.  In  Lib,  no \nhousehold has a proper toilet, however only 13% are without such facilities on Jabat. Only a few \nhouseholds  on  Jaluit,  representing  less  than  0.5% of  all  households  in  the  project  area,  have \npiped water compared to a national average of 14.3%. Well water is used by 9% of households \nin the project area. In the distant islands the proportion is 14.2% compared to only 4.1% in the \nclose islands and to a national average of 3.4%. Household rainwater catchment is the primary \nsource  of  drinking  water  for  households  in  the  project  area.  On  Wotho,  Lib,  and  Jabat  all \nhouseholds  rely  on  rainwater  as  do  more  than  90%  of  the  households  on  eight  other  project \narea islands. Well water supplies are fragile sources and are easily contaminated, while reliance \non rainfall becomes a problem in many of the outer islands during periods of drought. \n \nThe household characteristics described indicate the relative disadvantages and poverty \n15. \nexperienced by households in the project area. Ownership of household assets, access to safe \nwater and proper toilet facilities, and the availability and use of electricity for cooking and lighting \nare all much worse in the project area than in the country as a whole. This suggests that living \nconditions  are  generally  poor  and  that  the  lack  of  incomes  constrains  families  from  acquiring \nhousehold assets and improving their living conditions. The data also suggest that households \nin the islands most distant from Majuro experience the greatest level of poverty in the country. \nThe most distant islands will be the islands to benefit most from the Project since they are the \nones that have the least regular and least reliable transport services at present. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nProject's Impact on Poverty \n\nC. \n \n16. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  on  outer  island  communities  will  be  primarily  through \nimprovements  to  the  regularity  and  reliability  of  ship  visits  to  each  island  which  will  have  the \nfollowing poverty reduction benefits to the outer island communities: \n \n\nimproved supply and availability of goods from the on-board merchants at more \ncompetitive  prices  with  less  opportunities  for  island  stores  to  over-charge  for \ngoods between irregular ships calls\u2014this will assist the majority of households in \nthe targeted islands who are poor to get better value for their low incomes; \nimproved availability of services from government agencies, including health and \neducation,  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  and  other  departments  and  agencies  that \ntravel  on  field  trips\u2014this  will  help  reduce  problems  of  access  to  basic  services, \ninformation, supplies of school books and materials and supplies for island clinics \nand will assist in the implementation of other outer island projects through better \ntransport of labor, materials and equipment; \nimproved shipping for export of produce from the islands to the markets in Majuro \nand Ebeye\u2014this will enable poor outer island families to increase their incomes; \nit  is  estimated  that  incomes  could  increase  by  20%  from  increased  copra \nproduction  alone  (again,  the  majority  of  poor  households  depend  on  minimal \ncash incomes from the production of copra); \nimproved  commercial  systems  for  shipping,  including  recording  of  cargoes  and \ngoods liability regimes and less loss or damage to perishable and other cargoes \nfrom  poor  handling  facilities  at  island  wharves\u2014this  will  help  address  problems \nwith  security  of  cargoes  and  late  payment  and  will  thus  assist  the  poor  to \nmaximize the returns from their production; it will also assist in creating a better \nenvironment in which private enterprises can be established; \nimproved  safety  on  board  ships  from  the  better  navigation  aids  (navaids)  and \npassenger  facilities  at  the  embarkation/disembarkation  points  at  the  island \nwharves, especially for children and the elderly (fatal accidents have occurred at \nsome difficult locations in the past); \nrunway  extensions  and  improved  runway  maintenance  will,  for  the  poor, \ndisadvantaged outer island families, (a) provide safer, more regular and reliable \nflights to the main centers; (b) allow higher payloads and increase space for high \nvalue  and  perishable  goods;  (c)  provide  improved  emergency  evacuation \nservices  as  required;  and  for  Air  Marshall  Islands  (AMI),  they  will  enable \noperation and maintenance costs to be contained. \n\nFor the whole population of the RMI the benefits of the project will include: \n\n16. \n \n\nreduced  costs  and  greater  efficiency  in  providing  services  to  the  outer  islands, \nespecially  in  relation  to  the  field  trips  and  the  supply  of  staff,  materials  and \nequipment to health clinics, schools, and island projects; \nreduced budget costs for outer island shipping and air services and in subsidies \nto copra producers; these savings will make available more resources for priority \nsectors, including health and education, which will help further reduce the poverty \nof opportunity of the people in the project area; \nless,  or  at  least  a  slowing  in  the  rate  of  migration  from  the  outer  islands  to  the \nurban areas and a consequent minimizing of the likely costs of additional urban \ninfrastructure and services. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9  \n\nThe impact on government and NGO services will be to relieve the costs, staff time, and \n17. \nuncertainty  associated  with  trying  to  deliver  essential,  pro-poor,  public  services  to  the  outer \nislands. This will allow saved time and money to be put to productive use and raise the reliability \nand productivity of social programs. Problems currently experienced are: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nin \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs\u2014staff  cannot  visit  regularly  due  to  the  irregular \nshipping  service;  lengths  of  stay  are  indeterminate  and  staff  time  is  wasted; \nhence  trips  are  made  less  frequently  than  they  should.  The  Ministry  of  Internal \nAffair's  mobile  community  development  team  tries  to  visit  7  islands  a  year  in \nresponse  to  requests  from  local  governments  but  cannot  achieve  its  targets; \nexpensive special charters or air travel can be required. \nThe  Women's  Development  Office  (WDO)  works  closely  with  two  NGO  groups, \nWomen  United  Together  in  Marshall  Islands  (WUTMI) and  the  Marshall  Islands \nHandicraft  Association  (MIHA) \nthe  support  of  women's  development, \nparticularly  in  the  development  of  the  handicraft  industry.  Lack  of  transport  is  a \nmajor impediment to marketing. \nThe Ministry of Education (MoE) requires regular contact with the outer islands in \norder  to  complete  annual  monitoring  and  training  programs;  the  cost  of  flights \nprecludes regular monitoring and the field trip schedule is not frequent enough to \nbe  used  for  this  purpose.  Irregularity  of  the  field  trip  vessel  and  security  of \nsupplies  on  board  are  significant  problems.  The  schedule,  even  when  adhered \nto,  is  not  synchronized  with  the  school  terms  and  often  teachers,  students,  and \nmaterials  arrive  after  the  school  year  has  commenced.  MoE  avoids  the  theft  of \neducational  materials  by  sending  staff  members  along  with  the  materials  to \nensure  their  safe  arrival  at  the  outer  island  schools.  This  takes  staff  away  from \ntheir regular duties for several weeks. Transport of secondary school students is \na difficult exercise and often MoE needs to recruit other vessels such as PWD's \nYFUs  to  assist.  MoE  also  needs  to  transport  food  to  the  secondary  boarding \nschools  on  a  regular  basis.  Often  schools  run  out  and  MoE  has  to  charter  a \nvessel  to  transport  additional  or  top-up  food  supplies.  A  more  regular  field  trip \nschedule would be beneficial as MoE could send food supplies on a regular basis \nand secondly would not have the large up-front costs of providing food for 3 or 4 \nmonths at a time. \nProposed Women's & Youth Training Center\u2014ADB has funded the development \nof  a  Women's  &  Youth  Skills  Training  Center  based  in  Majuro.  The  project \nfocuses on upgrading existing skills training into a comprehensive and integrated \ntraining system. The target beneficiaries of the project are the women and youth \nof  the  outer  islands  and  will  seek  to  provide  skills  training  that  will  improve \nincome-generating  capabilities.  Initially  the  project  will  train  800  women,  600 \nyouths, and 150 people who have dropped out of high school. For women to be \nable to fully utilize the opportunities provided by the Center, affordable, regular, \nand  reliable  transport  services  between  the  outer  islands  and  Majuro  will  be \nessential.  First,  women  cannot  be  away  from  their  homes  and  families  for  too \nlong and this requires a service that can bring women from the outer islands to \nMajuro  and  return  within  about  a  week.  Second,  women  will  require  regular \nsupport visits from Center, WUTMI, and WDO staff when first establishing small \nbusinesses. \nHealth Services Delivery\u2014the Department of Health (DoH) is an office within the \nMinistry of Health & Environment (MoH&E), which operates two hospitals, one in \nMajuro  and  the  other  in  Ebeye,  as  well  as  60  health  clinics/dispensaries  in  the \nouter islands. The dispensaries are only capable of handling basic health care as \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\nthey often do not have electricity and are only equipped with rudimentary plant. \nDoH also provides a traveling clinic, which services the more remote islands. In \nemergencies  the  outer  island  dispensary  will  arrange  a  medi-vac\u2014by  either  an \nAMI flight or chartered boat depending on the seriousness of the condition\u2014and \nthis  is  charged  to  the  MoH&E  budget.  For  regular  transport  of  medical  supplies \nDoH  will  reserve  space  on  scheduled  flights  and  use  shipping  services  for  the \ntransport of larger items. It should be noted that the shipment of larger items is \nonly required for the construction (or refit) of dispensaries and thus DoH is not a \nregular user of the field trip service. \n\n(vi)  WUTMI is an NGO, first established in 1987, but has only been able to meet and \norganize  on  an  irregular  basis  due  to  lack  of  funding  and  difficulties  with \ncommunication  between  Majuro  and  the  outer  islands.  Under  the  umbrella  of \nWDO, WUTMI and its local chapters look after family, church, community groups, \nhealth  awareness,  sports  activities,  microcredit  schemes  and  women's \ndevelopment  projects  in  the  outer  islands.  The  constitution  of  WUTMI  requires \nmeetings  every  2  years  to  undertake  general  business  and  to  elect  new \nexecutive board members. The meetings have not occurred every 2 years due to \ndifficulties  with  getting  all  women  involved  to  one  place  on  time;  some  women \nhave  to  fly  to  reduce  the  amount  of  time  involved  and  this  becomes  very \nexpensive  and  ultimately  impractical  for  WUTMI  under  its  current  funding \narrangements.  WUTMI  organizes  the  transport  of  handicraft  and  other  goods \n(salted clams, preserved breadfruit, and banana bread) from the outer islands to \neither  Majuro  or  Ebeye.  AMI  often  does  not  have  enough  room  for  the  goods; \nsome goods get left behind and other goods have to in effect purchase a seat on \nthe  aircraft  in  order  to  get  them  to  the  main  centers.  WUTMI  has  also  had  its \nfreight  bumped  off  the  scheduled  flights  if  the  flights  are  too  full  and  has \nexperienced  goods  going  missing.  The  field  trip  schedule  is  neither  regular  nor \nreliable enough for WUTMI to use this method of handicraft transportation. \n\nSocial Impacts of Construction \n\nAll outer island construction projects will employ local labor, which will be derived from \n\nD. \n \n18. \npoor households. \n \n19.  Many  of  the  subprojects  involve  improvements,  extensions,  or  rehabilitation  to  existing \ninfrastructure and do not require the clearance or occupation of new land or water area. There \nare  projects  that  involve  new  dock/jetty  sites,  new  warehouses,  and  clearance  of  tracks  and \nrunway extensions. In no case is resettlement of population expected to be required. Clearance \nof  vegetation  will  in  some  cases  involve  removal  or  trimming  of  trees  although  only  on  a  very \nsmall scale. \n \n20. \nDuring consultations between and among the Government, local communities, and ADB \nconsultants, the social effects of the projects were discussed with the local communities on site. \nIn many cases the subprojects being proposed had been identified and discussed in the past. It \nwas clear that the communities placed a much higher value on securing the new infrastructure \nand  more  reliable  transport  services  than  the  possible  short-term  inconveniences  and  use  of \nland  and  coastal  zone  for  the  new  infrastructure.  None  of  the  sites  for  new  buildings  was \nconsidered  to  be  a  problem,  although  this  does  not  preclude  the  later  possibility  of \ncompensation. \n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9  \n\nImpacts from increased transport activity are very low, as ship calls are only at 6- to 8-\n21. \nweek intervals and aircraft normally only once per week. Arrivals are more a cause of interest \nthan  an  imposition.  In  all  cases,  the  locations  of  boat  landing  points  and  airstrip  runways  are \nunchanged.  On  none  of  the  atolls  and  islands  visited  was  the  increase  in  noise  and  traffic \n(mostly pedestrian, push carts, and a few vehicles) considered to be a significant effect. Instead \nan  increase  in  social  and  economic  activity  at  a  centralized  point  (dock  and  warehouse)  was \nwelcomed by the Government and local communities. \n \nE. \n \n \n \n22.  Meto  2000  and  the  subsequent  Second  National  Economic  and  Social  Summit \n(NESS II) held in 2001 set direction and strategy for the next 15 years. Elements of the strategy \nthat impact on poverty reduction in the outer islands and provide the setting for this Project are: \n \n \n\nGovernment Strategy for the Outer Islands \n\nPoverty Reduction Strategy \n\n(i) \n\n1. \n\nGoal  2:  Renewed  Economic  Growth,  Strategy  2,  Improve  Infrastructure: \nensure regular and reliable outer island shipping and air services, solar or diesel \npower, potable water and telecommunications all at regionally competitive costs \nto  users  (including  where  necessary  transparent  and  monitored  subsidy  to \nnoncommercial services); and \nGoal  3:  Equitable  Distribution,  Eliminate  Deprivation  and  Poverty  in  RMI, \nStrategy  3,  Outer  Island  Development  Program:  maintain  reliable  shipping \nservices  through  monitored  contracts  with  private  operators,  bring  under  review \nthe  per-head  distribution  of,  and  access  to,  land,  marine  resources,  economic \nand  social  services  and  infrastructure  in  the  atolls  other  than  Majuro  and \nKwajalein,  identify  areas  of  significantly  below-average  access  and  inventory, \nand  develop  a  practical  program  for  progressively  reducing  the  deficiencies  as \nrevenue and aid resources permit. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n2. \n\nOuter Island Development Priorities \n\nOther general goals that have a bearing are promotion of private enterprise, facilitating \n\n \n23. \nland leasing, provision of development credit, and strengthening privatization and outsourcing. \n \n \n \n24. \nDuring  project  feasibility  consultation,  the  local  government  and  community  members \nwere asked to discuss issues related to island development generally and to the development \npriorities of their islands in particular. Improved access and transport ranked as a high priority \nfor  all  of  the  22  islands  visited.  In  the  most  general  terms  development  of  infrastructure \n(transport and energy supply/electricity) and assistance and support for agriculture and farming \nwere seen as critical to the socioeconomic development of the outer islands. \n \n25. \nLocal  government  members,  acting  mayors,  and  the  communities  interviewed  also \nconsidered that improving transport links and access is a spearhead for economic growth and \ndevelopment.  This  is  demonstrated  in  the  following  comments  that  consider  transport \nimprovements could create a range of benefits including: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimproved access to the urban markets and key social services as well as cultural \nand economic exchange will be more convenient; \ntravel able can be planned according to a regular and reliable trip schedule, and \ntravel time reduced; and \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\n(iii) \n\nfish and agricultural products can be sold more regularly to Majuro and Ebeye. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\nProject Positioning \n\nBilateral and Multilateral Aid Programs \n\nAssistance  from  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies  is  targeted  at  the  outer  islands  in \n\n \n \n \n26. \nother development sectors, as described in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n27. \nThe  Project  has  a  high  degree  of  support  within  the  Government  and  from  the  outer \nisland  communities,  and  is  fully  consistent  with  the  national  development  goals  and  strategies \nestablished by Meto 2000 and NESS II 2001. \n \n28. \nFor  the  effects  of  the  project  on  poverty  reduction  to  be  fully  realized,  both  the \ninfrastructure improvements and the complementary efficiencies in transport services will need \nto be mobilized together. This is the rationale for the actions to be taken during loan processing \nand in parallel with implementation. \n \n29. \nThe transport infrastructure project is related closely to other development strategies and \nprojects  in  the  outer  islands  and,  in  particular,  to  the  future  of  the  production  of  local  produce \nand to the development of other economic activities, including tourism. \n \n \n \nIt is clear that more than physical infrastructure alone will be required to assist the outer \n30. \nislands in their socioeconomic development. Overall, an integrated approach to development is \nrequired. Such an approach needs to be rooted in progressing investments in human and social \ndevelopment (including human resource development and outer island services enhancement) \nand physical infrastructure in tandem. The Project is in a good position to encourage investment \nin  areas  that  also  support  outer  island  development  and  poverty  reduction;  in  some  cases, \nproject components could be advanced as part of a multisector island development project. \n \n31. \nfor investment include: \n \n\nThe  types  of  integrated  programs  and  complementary  activities  that  could  be  targeted \n\nComplementary and Supporting Activities \n\n5. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nresource management projects, particularly aimed at diversifying and increasing \nagricultural productivity in the outer islands, community-based fisheries projects, \nand active participation in environmental protection; \npaid  participation  in  transport  infrastructure,  maintenance,  and  development \nprojects,  such  as \nregular  airstrip  clearing,  community  or  cooperative \nmanagement of warehouses, self-policing island based groups aimed at reducing \nvandalism to navigation aids, maintenance of tracks and roads, development of \npotable water sources, irrigation systems, and small island energy systems; \ninstitutional  capacity  building  within  agencies  that  have  the  mandate  for \nresources development, outer islands development and poverty reduction; and \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  microcredit  and  microfinancing  schemes,  outer \nisland enterprise development and community-based participatory planning. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9  \n\nYes \n\nTable A9: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the RMI: \n \nTransport services provide the lifeline to the outer islands. Shipping brings in essential goods and services and takes \nout  island  produce  from  which  the  poor  earn  a  substantial  portion  of  their  incomes.  Shipping  also  brings  in \ngovernment  services  and  supplies,  particularly  to  the  schools  and  health  clinics.  Shipping  provides  an  essential \nservice to families in transporting children to and from secondary schools and colleges elsewhere in the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands (RMI), and in providing links for everyone to the urban centers and the outside world. Air \nservices provide passenger and freight transport, as well as emergency evacuation services for sick and vulnerable \npeople. \n\nYes \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \nB. \nAnalysis: \n \nThirty  percent  of  the  population  lives  in  the  19  outer  islands  which  makes  up  the  project  area.  Communities  in  the \nouter  islands  suffer  from  physical  isolation  leading  to  low  incomes,  lack  of  basic  services,  and  poverty  of \nopportunity. The people who live in these outer islands have significantly lower incomes than the national average, \nand it is estimated that around two thirds of the population in the project area has an income level below the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) poverty line threshold of $1 a day. \n\nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\n \nC. \nStakeholder analysis prepared  \nConsultants  visited  all  project  sites  and  conducted  consultations  with  local  governments  and  communities  during \n\nParticipation Process \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nproject preparatory stage. \n\n \nParticipation strategy : \nLocal  governments  and  communities  will  be  consulted  during  design  phase  to  ensure  full  participation  of  local \n\nYes \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nstakeholders in prioritizing subprojects. \n\nSignificant,  \nNot Significant, \n\nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \n \nOutput Prepareda \nResettlement Framework \nNone \nNone \nNone \nNone \n\nNone \n\nSocial Issues \n\n \nD. \n \n \nSubject \nResettlementb \nGender \nAffordability \nLabor \nIndigenous  \nPeople \nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nresettlement plan. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\na   A plan will be required if any of the potential issues are found to be significant. \nb   Significant  involuntary  resettlement  requires  a  full  resettlement  plan;  nonsignificant  resettlement  requires  a  short \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nApproach \n\nProject Costs \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \n1. \nThe  costs  included  in  the  economic  analysis  are  those  for  civil  works,  equipment, \nconsulting  services,  and  physical  contingencies.  The  financial  costs  were  converted  into \neconomic costs by eliminating price escalation and interest during construction as well as taxes \nand duties from the financial costs. All costs are mid-2001 prices. \n \n \n \n2. \nProject  benefits  for  marine  components  are  derived  primarily  from  savings  in  ship  and \nboat operating costs, comprising fuel, crew costs, other direct operating expenses, and savings \nin  fleet  size.  Other  contributions  to  project  benefits  are  (i) savings  in  ship  and  boat  operating \ncosts,  (ii) reduced  cargo-handling  and  weather  damage,  (iii) reduced  loss  in  cargo  value  from \nincreased  service  reliability,  (iv) reductions  in  passenger  travel  time,  and  (v) reduced  risk  of \nvessel grounding and damage or loss. \n \nBenefits for airstrip extensions and remedial maintenance arise from (i) user benefits of \n3. \nreopening  closed  airstrips  (two  of  the  projects);  (ii) reduced  damage  to  aircraft  from  loose \nmaterial on the runway; (iii) reduced risk to aircraft by improved obstruction clearances, longer \nand  better  surfaced  runway  with  markings,  and  wind  indicator;  and  (iv) increased  payload \ncapacity arising from runway improvement.1 \n \n \n \nImproved service frequency and reliability consequent on the reduced voyage times, and \n4. \ncorresponding  freight  and  passenger  cost  reductions  translating  into  lower  tariffs,  will  have \ndemand-side  effects.  The  response  of  copra  growers  to  changes  in  the  copra  buying  price \nindicates  that  higher  prices  do  not  necessarily  lead  to  increased  production,  so  lower  freight \ncosts  may  similarly  not  always  have  that  effect.  However,  responses  from  the  consultations \nindicate  that  increased  service  frequency,  to  a  maximum  of  between  8  and  12  ship  calls  per \nyear, would result in some increased copra production. In turn, the increased cash income can \nbe  expected  to  lead  to  increased  consumption  of  imported  goods  and,  possibly,  to  a  higher \npropensity for personal travel. \n \n5. \nThere  are  two  methods  that  are  generally  used  for  calculating  the  benefits  of  induced \ntravel demand. The easiest to apply, provided the elasticity of demand with respect to transport \ncosts is known, is a transport user surplus approach, the benefits being assessed as the implied \nvalue of the additional travel, measured as the product of the increase in transport demand and \nthe reduction in travel cost multiplied by a half (the demand curve being assumed straight over \nthe marginal change). \n \n6. \nA  more  complete  approach  and  one  that  can  be  applied  where  there  are  a  limited \nnumber of commodities being transported and where producer responses can be anticipated, is \nto measure the difference in producer surplus. In either case, an adjustment is required to the \n\nInduced Travel Demand \n\n3. \n\n                                                 \n1  The  expected  financial  return  of  this  last  benefit  is  relatively  limited  and  difficult  to  quantify,  thus,  it  is  not \n\nconsidered in the analysis\u2019 conservative assumption. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nanalysis of induced demand to take account of differences between resource costs and market \nprices. This is particularly important in this case where passenger fares, freight rates, and copra \nprices are all heavily subsidized. \n \nThe  net  benefits  attributable  to  induced  transport  demand  can  be  either  positive  or \n7. \nnegative depending on various factors such as comparative supply and demand elasticities and \nthe amount of difference between market prices and resource costs. It is quite feasible, and may \nbe the case here, that the economic value of induced demand is negative. \n \n8. \nIn  this  case,  a  lagged  model  of  copra  volumes  against  the  subsidized  grower  price \nshowed  a  weak  but  significant  relationship,  calibrated  to  a  price  elasticity  of  demand  of  0.26. \nThere  is  also  some  evidence  of  a  demand  relationship  against  regularity  of  shipping  services, \nbut insufficient data for calibration. \n \n9. \nOverall, induced demand effects are estimated to yield an increase of 30% in both copra \nvolumes  and  import  cargo  demand,  which  have  been  treated  as  generated  traffic  in  the \neconomic appraisal. \n \n \n \nThe  subprojects  cannot  each  be  evaluated  in  isolation  as  their  effects  are  interactive. \n10. \nThe  components  of  the  Project  are  integrated  and  mutually  complementary.  Providing  better \nnavigation  aids  and  marks  is  not  sufficient  on  its  own  since  the  benefits  of  easier  access  to \nlagoons  provided  by  the  navaids  can  only  be  realized  in  full  if  the  vessels  can  then  approach \ncloser  to  shore  through  cleared  passages  or  come  alongside  to  the  island  wharves. \nConsultations with ship operators and government indicate that night working is acceptable on \nthe islands and that the expected time savings will be realized. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nTotal  economic  cost  of  the  selected  project  components  is  $9.54 million.  Maintenance \ncosts  have  been  estimated  as  a  percentage  of  capital  value  per  annum  according  to  the \nfollowing assumptions: \n \n\nInterrelationship between Subprojects \n\nProject Costs \n\n4. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDocks and jetties\u20141% for deck furniture, fendering, etc. plus an allowance of 1% \nper year for periodic concrete repairs every 10 years. \nChannels  are  assumed  to  fill  in  over  a  period  of  between  10  and  20  years.  An \nannual maintenance allowance of 5% per annum is estimated from year 5. \nBreakwaters are designed on a 5% damage criterion for the design storm. For a \n100-year design return period storm, and a 20-year design life, this gives a 20% \nencounter probability over the design life, giving 1% in any year from year 1; also \nallow 1% of capital value for topping up rocks from year 5, giving 2% per annum \noverall. \n\n(iv)  Warehouses\u2014allow 1% year 3, 2% year 4, and 4% per annum from year 5. \n(v) \n\nNavaids\u2014no  maintenance  for  the  steel  pile  structure  for  20  years,  excluding \nmajor typhoon damage. Light fittings will cost about $1,000 to replace, including \nthe light itself. Allow replacement of 5% of light fittings in year 3, 10% in year 4, \nand 20% from year 5. \nTransport  equipment\u20145%  of  capital  value  in  year  3,  10%  in  year  4,  and  20% \nfrom year 5. \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nProject Benefits \n\nC. \n \n12. \nThe Project will contribute both directly and indirectly to poverty reduction in the project \narea. The revised discounted cash-flow analysis indicates that a total of around one third of the \naverage annual benefits will accrue directly to the people of the outer islands through (i) better \nmarket  access  and  increased  incomes  from  local  produce  sales  (10%  of  total  benefits); \n(ii) passenger  time  savings,  increased  safety,  and  less  cargo  damage  (25%  of  total  benefits); \nand  (iii) income  earned  from  employment  during  project  implementation.  Less  cargo  damage \nwill also benefit merchants, the public, and ship operators. Reduced operating costs, comprising \naround  half  of  the  total  benefits,  will  accrue  directly  to  ship  operators  and  to  the  Government \nthrough  reduced  operating  subsidies.  Outer  island  communities  will  benefit  indirectly  through \n(i) lower real fares and cargo charges; (ii) lower prices for store goods from on-board merchants \nresulting from increased competition; and (iii) less risk of stock loss and damage through poor \nhandling. \n \n13. \nThe largest source of benefits is ship time savings. The analysis shows that almost 20% \nof ship days could be saved, with a value of $0.4 million annually, provided that the opportunity \nis taken to do this (rather than the ships spending longer in port) and that the shipping fleet is \ndownsized, either by sale or lease of one or more vessels. \n \n14. \n \n\nOther sources of benefits are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nreduced  risk  of  rain  or  seawater  water  spoilage  and  handling  damage  where \ncargo transfer is from a vessel alongside rather than via lightering; valued at 1% \nof the free on board value of the cargo assuming values of $100 per ton for copra \nand $1,000 per ton for imported merchandise; \nsavings in passenger travel time\u2014valued at $3.50 per day weighted mean based \nupon 10% of passengers traveling during paid employment, and nonworking time \nvalued at 40% of work time; the work time value has been estimated from gross \ndomestic product and working population; \nreduced risk of passenger injury, scaled according to the type of landing facility \nand difficulty of embarkation/disembarkation and passage through the surf zone \nfor small craft; \nsavings  in  risk  of  grounding  and  damage  to  ships  and  ship's  boats  through \nimproved  navaids  and  beach  channels;  valued  at  1.25%  of  the  replacement \nvalue of the interisland fleet per year estimated at $4 million; \nshore  labor  cost  savings\u2014valued  at  the  implied  value  of  time  for  copra \nharvesting of 20 cents per hour; and \ntrade-offs between reduced costs of ships boats, increased costs of lagoon boat \ntransport and road transport are almost self-canceling so have been omitted. \n\n \n15.  Many  unquantifiable  benefits  accruing  to  the  outer  island  communities  have  not  been \ntaken  into  the  cash-flow  analysis.  In  particular  there  will  be  social  and  welfare  benefits  to  be \nderived  from  (i) improved  access  to  outer  island  communities  for  the  field  trip  medical, \neducation, public awareness, and other government service teams; (ii) easier and more frequent \ninteraction with other parts of the country; and (iii) better outer island project implementation as \nsupplies and technical support can more easily be sent to project sites. \n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nInternal Rate of Return \n\nD. \n \n16. \nThe  evaluation  has  been  carried  out  over  a  20-year  investment  period  which  generally \ncorresponds to the design life of the navigation marks (25 years for civil works and 5 to 10 years \nfor lights), and the jetties (25 years for good maintenance, 15 years for poor maintenance). The \nProject achieves a 14.5% economic internal rate of return. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates \nthat the Project is robust and remains financially viable even with adverse movements in some \nparameters  such  as  lower  project  benefits,  increase  in  capital  cost,  and  delay  in  project \nimplementation.  The  results  of  sensitivity  analyses,  given  in  the  table  below,  testing  project \nviability for primary parameters also demonstrates robust economic viability of the Project. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Sensitivity Test \n\n \n\n \n\nBase Case \n1.

the Project \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nA detailed description of the Project is given in paragraphs 25 to 49 of the main report \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  completed  as  part  of  the  project \n1. \npreparatory technical assistance in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Infrastructure Projects \nand the consulting firm\u2019s report is included in the feasibility study report. This summary IEE is \nprovided  for  evaluation  purposes  on  the  environmental  impacts  and  mitigating  measures  of  a \ntypical  subproject.  The  Environmental  Protection  Authority  (EPA)  was  also  consulted  in  the \nenvironmental assessment. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nand recommendation of the President. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nPhysical  Environment.  The  Republic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (RMI)  has  a  total  land \narea of only 110 square kilometers (km2) spread over 1,225 individual islets, the largest no more \nthan  0.8 km2.  The  atolls  and  islands  of  the  RMI  are  made  up  of  coral  reef  material  and \nsediments  that  have  formed  over  submarine  volcanoes.  The  islands  and  atolls  vary  in  shape \nand size from small isolated islands with no central lagoon (Mejit, Jabat, Kili, and Lib), to small \natolls  with  totally  enclosed  lagoons  (Namorik),  and  to  larger  atolls  with  one  or  many  breaks  in \nthe reef, the largest being Kwajalein Atoll with a lagoon area of 839 km2. The width of the land \narea on the atolls is frequently only 100 meters (m) to 300 m, and exceptionally up to 2 km. The \nislets are low and flat, generally higher on the ocean side, but usually no more than 3 m. Most \nlagoons have one or more deep passes through the surrounding reef with high tidal flows and \noften strong currents. Approaches to beaches on the lagoon side are frequently obstructed by \nwide reef flats, in some places up to 2 kms width. These reef flats are generally up to 2 m depth \nbelow mean sea level with large areas exposed at low tide. \n \nTerrestrial  Flora  and  Fauna.  According  to  the  National  Environmental  Management \n4. \nStrategy, there is no record of the original vegetation and fauna of the Marshall Islands, and no \nendemic  terrestrial  species  are  known  today.  Disturbance  by  human  habitation  of  over  3,000 \nyears has probably altered the vegetation through the introduction of plants as sources of food \nand craft material, and also exotic mammals\u2014pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, and rats. There are 70 \nrecognized  avian  species,  mostly  migratory  seabirds.  One,  the  Ratak  Micronesian  Pigeon,  is \nlisted as an endangered species. Reptiles consist of seven lizard species and one blind snake, \nall  introduced.  Insects  and  spiders  are  abundant.  Coconut  crabs  (birgos  latro  and  coenobita \nrugosa)  are  found  on  coconut  plantations  and  are  highly  valued  for  their  flesh  but  are \nendangered. \n \n5. \nMarine  Flora  and  Fauna.  There  is  a  diverse  array  of  coral  and  invertebrate  species \ninhabiting the reefs and the inter-tidal zone, including sponges, whelks, clams, oysters, mussels, \ngastropods,  tunicates,  worms,  crabs,  shrimps,  sea  cucumbers,  and  starfish.  All  five  of  the \nworld's species of marine turtle inhabit the islands. At least two of these species, the green turtle \n(chelonia  mydas)  and  hawksbill  turtle,  are  endangered.  A  number  of  other  marine  mammals, \nmainly dolphin and whale species, are also endangered. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\n2. \n\n1. \n\nNavigation Aids \n\nBeach Channels \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\nD. \n \n \n \nThe construction technique for placing navigation marks involves percussion drilling into \n6. \ncoral,  often  below  high  water  mark  and  sometimes  below  low  water  mark.  Depending  on  the \nconstruction  method  adopted,  it  may  be  necessary  to  place  a  working  platform  mounted  on \njacks  temporarily  on  the  reef.  In  either  case  there  will  be  some  disturbance  to  the  reef  at  the \npoints chosen, although the area of effect will be very small and permanent modification will be \nnegligible. The magnitude of effects from placement of navigation aids (navaids) will be minor. \n \n \n \n7. \nCreation of beach channels is likely to be the most environmentally sensitive aspect of \nthe Project. However, the scale of the effect in relation to the length of shoreline is minor, and in \nalmost  all  cases  the  sites  chosen  have  previously  been  modified  by  past  efforts  at  channel \ncreation. The construction activity will involve excavation of coralline rock and soft sediments to \ncreate  beach  channels.  This  work  will  generally  be  carried  out  at  low  tide  by  mechanical \nequipment  that  works  out  slowly  from  the  shore,  using  the  excavated  material  to  provide  a \nworking platform that may be removed at the completion of the work or left in place to form a \nbreakwater where this is desirable (in which case rock armor would be applied on completion). \nMitigation  measures  that  can  be  considered  include  maximizing  the  amount  of  excavation \ncarried out in the dry at low tide, and the creation of a silt fence around the works. A silt fence \nwould require temporary steel piles into the lagoon bed to which filter cloth would be attached \nand  consideration  is  required,  for  each  site,  of  whether  the  disturbance  and  cost  of  this \nmitigation  work  is  warranted.  Fill  areas  will  be  selected  to  minimize  effects  on  living  coral \ncolonies. \n \n \n \n8. \nThere  are  three  locations  (Malel  on  Arno,  Jittoen  on  Ebon,  and  Jeh  on  Ailinglaplap) \nwhere new dock construction at the beach is proposed and one location where the proposal is \nfor a transfer dock at the reef edge (reef platform) (Mejit). Repairs to, or extensions of, existing \nstructures are planned at Buoj on Ailinglaplap, Likiep, Taroa on Maloelap, and Wotje on Wotje. \nIn all cases the docks are at locations where ships already anchor, so the environmental effects \nof  ship  calls  are  not  significantly  altered  (pollution  effects  such  as  leakages,  discharges,  and \nrefuse).  Land-based  impacts  will  include  some  temporary  disruption  from  the  location  of \nconstruction plant and materials close to the site, which will involve some temporary occupation \nof  land,  construction  noise,  dust,  and  hazards  from  the  use  of  heavy  machinery.  Mitigation \nmeasures will include fencing off the working area for safety purposes and a requirement on the \ncontractor to restore the working area as closely as possible to its initial condition. \n \n9. \nIn  three  cases  (Imiej,  Taroa,  and  Wotje)  the  docks  to  be  extended  are  World  War  II \n(WWII) docks. There are three existing docks at Wotje, any of which could be selected as the \ndock  to  be  extended.  There  is  a  need  for  a  pragmatic  approach  to  the  conservation  of  WWII \nstructures  that  are  still  in  use,  as  conservation  requirements  must  be  balanced  with  the  social \nand economic development of current and future generations. \n \n\nDocks and Reef Platforms \n\n3. \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n4. \n\nWarehouses \n\nTrack Improvements \n\nAirstrip Rehabilitation \n\n \n \n10. \nConstruction  of  warehouses  will  involve  land  acquisition  and  temporary  disruption  of  a \nminor  nature  during  construction.  Materials  will  generally  be  prefabricated,  imported  and \nassembled  on  site,  with  the  exception  of  the  building  platform  and  foundation  slab.  No \nsignificant environmental effects are anticipated. \n \n \n \n11. \nIn most cases, for existing vehicle tracks and walking paths, the scale of this work is very \nminor  and  will  involve  localized  clearance  of  vegetation,  widening  and  placement  of  small \namounts of coral surfacing won from the adjacent ocean side beach ridge. For a few locations, \nconstruction of new track is envisaged. In this case the physical effects will be more significant \nand  will  involve  location  of  a  3 m  wide  route  (4 m  clearance  strip),  removal  of  vegetation  and \norganic soils, import, placement and rolling of small volumes of coral material won from selected \nquarry  locations  on  ocean  or  lagoon  side  beaches  above  the  high  tide  mark.  Construction \nequipment will comprise a small bulldozer, truck, excavator, and roller imported by landing craft. \nMitigation  measures  to  be  considered  will  include  route  selection  that  minimizes  removal  of \nbearing coconut palms and other food trees, as well as avoidance of houses, funeral plots, and \nfood gardens. Extraction of coral material for road base will be from preselected locations to a \nmaximum volume and with quarry site restoration plan to avoid the creation of foreshore erosion \nproblems or ponding of rainwater that could constitute a health hazard. \n \n \n \n12. \nThe  work  will  include  clearing  of  all  vegetation  (some  up  to  3 m  in  height)  back  to  the \nlines of coconut trees that are parallel to the existing airstrips. The surface of the runway section \nof the airstrips will be regraded and all obstacles (such as rocks and tree stumps) removed. The \nrunway  areas  will  then  be  rolled  and  compacted  and  topped  up  with  coral  gravel  and  sand  if \nrequired. It is considered that only small amounts of fill will be required and its excavation will be \na minor activity if material is won from several different areas around the atoll rather than from \none location. \n \n \n \n13. \nA small quantity of armor rock for breakwaters will be obtained through drilling, blasting, \nand extraction by rock grab and bucket excavator from selected locations on the ocean side reef \nflat.  Where  this  excavation  is  necessary,  the  EPA  has  developed  criteria  for  minimizing  the \nadverse environmental effects by requiring the rock cuts to be more than 30 m in from the reef \nedge  and  more  than  30 m  out  from  the  shoreline.  Cuts  are  square  sided  to  promote  later \nregrowth  of  coral  on  the  vertical  faces.  Other  excavation  will  generally  be  of  beach  sand  and \ncoral rubble from lagoon or ocean sides at preselected locations. In some cases, where material \nis not available on land, dragline recovery from the lagoon may be required. \n \nE. \n \n14. \nThe  responsibility  for  future  environmental  management  of  the  proposed  wharf  and \nfacilities  at  these  subproject  areas  will  lie  with  the  project  proponent,  which  would  be  the \nMinistry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC). This entity represents the government \ninterest  in  the  facilities.  All  the  measures  that  have  been  specified  in  this  document  will  be \nits \nthe  construction  documents,  plans  and  specifications \nincorporated \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nExtraction of Quarry Material \n\nto  ensure \n\n7. \n\nin \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\nimplementation.  The  EPA  and  MOTC  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  mitigating \nmeasures. \n \nF. \n \n15. \nThe adverse environmental effects of the Project will be generally confined to the inter-\ntidal  zone  within  atoll  lagoons  and  land  areas  in  the  vicinity  of  tracks  and  warehouses.  These \nimpacts  will  be  highly  localized  in  terms  of  significance  range  from  minor  impact,  particularly \nwhen the zone of effect on marine ecology is compared with the overall length of shoreline in \nthe area with similar environmental values. \n \nG.  \n \n16. \nwill not have any significant impacts on the environment. \n \n\nThe  Project  does  not  warrant  a  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  study,  and \n\nConclusion \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTING SERVICES \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\nTerms of Reference \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \n1. \nThese  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  are  for  the  provision  of  engineering  services  by  an \ninternational consulting firm (the Consultant) for the procurement of the Outer Islands Transport \nInfrastructure  Project.  The  TOR  set  out  the  scope  of  the  Project,  the  scope  of  work  of  the \nConsultant, general design specifications, and deliverable schedules. \n \n2. \nThe Consultant will be responsible for (i) obtaining all necessary site data; (ii) overseeing \nall  investigations;  (iii) undertaking  detailed  design;  (iv) preparation  of  tender  documents; \n(v) calling and evaluating tenders; and (vi) construction monitoring and management. \n \n3. \nThe Consultant will be appointed under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. Procurement of the main construction contract will be undertaken by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  under  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Loans. \n \nThe site investigation, detailed design, contractor prequalification, and tendering stages \n4. \nare expected to occupy 6 months, commencing in January 2003, and the construction a period \nof 2.5 years. \n \n \n \n5. \n \n\nThe Consultant will: \n\nSite Investigation \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nvisit the site of each subproject and confirm the locations for all proposed works \nusing  a  reliable  means  of  global  positioning,  such  as  the  Global  Positioning \nSystem,  plus  means  of  identification  relative  to  local  fixed  features.  This  will \ninvolve  discussions  with  local  communities  on  the  precise  location  of  proposed \nbuildings and track improvements; \nidentify any issues regarding the use of land, resettlement requirements (if any), \nleasing,  and  compensation.  These  issues  are  to  be  conveyed  to  the  executing \nagency  for  resolution.  The  consultant  will  assist  the  Government  in  obtaining \nresolution prior to the award of contracts for construction; and \nprepare TOR and bid documents for comprehensive site investigation. \n\n \n6. \nThe scope of the site investigation will be assessed based on the investigations carried \nout during the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA).1 The Consultant will review the \nscope of the proposed investigation and list of project locations and confirm the suitability of the \nlocations  or  adjust  them  as  required,  before  commissioning  the  site  investigation.  The \nconsultant will then prepare TOR for the site investigation to enable this to be determined in as \nmuch detail as possible and competitively bid. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n7. \n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nThe site investigation will include, as a minimum: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nHydrographic  surveys  to  appropriate  accuracy  of  all  marine  sites,  including  the \ndetermination of tidal parameters for each site including: (a) highest astronomical \ntide,  (b)  mean  high  water  springs,  (c)  mean  high  water  neaps,  (d)  mean  sea \nlevel,  (e)  mean  low  water  neaps,  (f)  mean  low  water  springs,  and  (g)  lowest \nastronomical tide. \nTopographical surveys of all land sites. Topographic surveys must be related to \nthe  tidal  datum.  A  permanent  survey  mark  or  marks  must  be  built  at  each  site, \nsurveyed  and  position  and  heights  recorded  in  terms  of  the  datum.  A  local \ncoordinate datum may be established, however this datum must be coordinated \nin  terms  of  longitude  and  latitude.  Location  plans  for  each  mark  are  to  be \nprepared. \nGeotechnical investigations of proposed dock and channel sites and at least one \nrepresentative reef pass site. \nCollection, collation, and analysis of wind and wave data for the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands (RMI), using available data. This is to include data from tropical \nstorms, sufficient to allow suitable design criteria to be established. \nEnvironmental  investigations  required  to  complete  an  environmental  impact \nassessment  in  accordance  with  the  RMI  Environmental  Regulations  for  all \nsubprojects  in  discussion  with  and  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the \nRMI\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority. \nInvestigations required to complete a cultural assessment in accordance with the \nHistoric Preservation Office Regulations for all subprojects in discussion with and \nin accordance with the requirements of the RMI Historic Preservation Office, with \nparticular reference to any site that is noted by the Historic Preservation Office as \npotentially sensitive. \nSuch  other  information  that  the  Consultant  deems  necessary  to  complete  the \nProject. \n\n3. \n\nDetailed Design Parameters \n\nThe Consultant will specify the outputs and standards required of those carrying out the \n\n \n8. \ninvestigations. \n \n \n \n9. \nIndicative design criteria, established during the PPTA, are given below. The Consultant \nshould  satisfy  himself  that  these  design  criteria  are  an  optimum  economic  design  and \nappropriate  to  the  conditions,  in  addition  to  any  other  criteria  established  as  part  of  the \nConsultant's work. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nDesign life for marine navigation aids (navaids) and warehouses of 20 years, and \nfor marine structures and airstrip extensions 50 years. \nAll  structures  designed  to  withstand  a  100-year  return  period  storm  event.  For \nreef  pass  navaids,  damage  to  (including  loss  of)  the  top  mark  and  light  during \nsuch  an  event  is  acceptable.  The  support  system  should  withstand  the  design \nevent. \nAll  structures  designed  to  an  accepted  design  standard,  such  as  those  of  the \nStandards  Australia/New  Zealand,  Japanese  Standards  Association,  American \nConcrete  Institute,  and  International  Association  of  Lighthouses  Authorities \n(IALA). \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nAll  materials  used  and  structures  designed  to  minimize  the  amount  of \nmaintenance that will be required; this applies in particular to the reef pass lights. \nSuperimposed live loads, to cater for loading of copra and unloading of general \ncargo such as food and building materials. Some of the incoming goods may be \npalletized  but  most  cargo  is  break-bulk.  None  of  the  present  vessels  handle \ncontainers.  There  are  generally  only  light  vehicles  in  the  outer  islands,  such  as \n1.5-ton  pickup  trucks,  which  would  be  used  to  unload  and  transport  cargo. \nDesign  superimposed  spread  load  capacity  of  15  kiloPascal,  and  design  axle \nload of 5 tons have been assumed. \nBerthing  loads\u2014in  most  cases,  berthing  will  take  place  with  an  offshore  wind \n(docks  on  east  side  of  atoll,  inside  lagoon,  prevailing  wind  east-northeast).  The \ncurrent  vessels  do  not  have  bow  thrusters.  A  design  allowance  for  berthing \nspeed  of  0.5  meters  (m)  per  second  and  approach  angle  of  15  degrees  is \nrecommended. \n\n(vii)  Mooring loads should allow for the possibility of ships being moored beam onto \nprevailing  winds.  A  minimum  bollard  capacity  of  10  tons  is  recommended. \nBollards  should  be  located  to  facilitate  mooring  of  the  vessels  in  the  most \npracticable  manner,  given  the  constraints  of  the  narrow  access  structures  and \nrelatively small dock tee heads. \n\n(viii)  Ship  data\u2014the  vessels  being  used  at  present  are  all  small  coastal  freighters, \ntypically using deck gear to transfer cargo into and from one or a pair of forward \nholds.  The  ships  have  some  passenger  capability.  The  following  ship  design \nparameters have been chosen as an envelope of the present ship sizes as it is \nlikely these vessels will be in service well after the new structures are complete: \n(a) draft less than 3.7 m, (b) molded depth less than 5.1 m, (c) length overall less \nthan  53.0 m,  (d)  beam  less  than  9.0 m,  (e) displaced  tonnage  less  than \n1,500 tons,  and  (f)  under-keel  clearance  a  minimum  of  1 m,  at  the  lowest \npredicted  astronomical  tide  is  required.  This  value  should  be  increased  where \nlarger waves can be expected. \n\n4. \n\nOutline Specification of the Works \n\nThe minimum requirements for each type of engineering works proposed are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBeach  and  reef  channels\u2014the  widened  channels  will  (a)  have  a  base  width  of \n6 m;  (b)  have  a  minimum  depth  of  1.0 m  below  the  local  tidal  datum  (LAT); \n(c) extend from the deep water into the shoreline, on the alignment of the existing \nchannel, and (d) be designed to avoid erosion of the beach and foreshore as a \nresult of increased wave action. \nShip  docks  will  (a)  have  a  standard  tee  head  arrangement  as  shown  in  the \nPPTA, (b) extend to a water depth of at least 4.7 m below low tide, (c) be suitable \nfor  berthing  and  mooring  the  design  ship,  (d)  be  suitable  for  the  use  of  light \npickup  trucks,  (e)  have  access  to  the  deck  for  users  of  traditional  Marshallese \ncraft and runabouts, and (f) be durable and robust. \n\n(iii)  Warehouses will have as a minimum the dimensions shown on the drawings and \nwill  have  the  following  attributes:  (a)  roof-mounted  photovoltaic  cells  and \nsupporting  electrical  systems  suitable \nthe  handicrafts  areas; \n(b) durable  roofing  materials  and  detailing  to  minimize  leaks  and  corrosion; \n(c) roof  water  capture  systems  (catchments)  and  water  tanks;  (d)  electrical \nlighting  systems  in  the  warehouse  suitable  for  power  supply  from  an  external \nportable  generator,  such  that  a  generator  can  be  used  to  light  the  warehouse \n\nlighting \n\nfor \n\n \n \n \n10. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\nspace while loading or unloading at night; (f) a natural draught ventilation system; \n(g)  a  mast  for  navigation  light  and  radio  antenna;  (h)  robust  and  durable  wall \nsystems; (i) a slab-on-grade, concrete floor; and (j) aluminum joinery to office and \nhandicrafts areas. \nReef  pass  lights  will  have  the  following  attributes:  (a)  sealed  and  self-powered \nnavigation  light,  in  accordance  with  IALA  standards  and  guidelines,  mounted  at \nleast 6 m above mean high water springs; (b) top mark in accordance with IALA \nstandards  and  guidelines;  (c)  individual  identification  marks,  reflective;  (d)  radar \nreflector;  (e)  visual  reflector;  (f)  access  to  allow  light  to  be  replaced;  and  (g)  no \nother maintenance to structure over 25-year design life. \nBuoys  will  have  the  following  attributes:  (a)  sealed  and  self-powered  navigation \nlight, in accordance with IALA standards and guidelines; (b) top mark or shape in \naccordance  with  IALA  standards  and  guidelines;  (c)  individual  identification \nmarks,  reflective;  (d)  a  radar  reflector;  (e)  a  visual  reflector;  and  (f)  access  to \nallow light to be replaced (g) mooring tackle and anchorage. \nLand  lights  will  have  the  following  attributes:  (a)  sealed  and  self-powered \nnavigation  light,  in  accordance  with  IALA  standards  and  guidelines;  (b)  a  radar \nreflector; and (c) a visual reflector. \nAirfields will have: (a) a cleared width of 60 m (200 feet); (b) a runway width of \n30 m  (100  feet);  (c)  lengths  as  shown  on  drawings  (PPTA);  (d)  runway  ends \ncleared  of  obstructions  above  a  1V  to  7H  plane  extending  from  end  of  runway; \n(e)  compacted  even  surface  to  runway;  (f)  concrete  edge  markers  at  152 m \ncenters, either side of the runway; and (g) windsocks at both ends of the airfield. \n\n(viii)  Tracks  will  be  (a)  3 m  cleared  width,  (b)  compacted  coral  surface,  and  (c)  sited \n\nover existing tracks wherever possible and practical. \n\nDeliverables and Reporting \n\n \nB. \n \n11. \nADB.
