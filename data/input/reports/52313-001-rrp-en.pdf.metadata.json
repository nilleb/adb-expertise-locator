The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  administration  of  (i)  a  grant  to  be \nprovided  by  the  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund  (UCCRTF)  under  the  Urban \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility;1 and  (ii)  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction  (JFPR),  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants.2 \n \n2. \nThe ERRM is structured to provide the Government of the Philippines with immediate and \nflexible financing to implement programs, projects, and activities (PPA) included in the Bangon \nMarawi  Comprehensive  Rehabilitation  and  Recovery  Program  (BMCRRP). 3  The  ERRM \ncomprises four outputs: (i) a quick-disbursing component to finance eligible expenditures of PPA \nin the BMCRRP, (ii) reestablishing connectivity in Marawi and its vicinity by rebuilding better public \ninfrastructure,  (iii)  restoring  water  utilities  and  health  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  improving  social \nservices for and livelihoods of the affected people. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE \n\n \nThe  Islamic  City  of  Marawi  is  the  capital  of  the  province  of  Lanao  del  Sur  in  the \n3. \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). According to the 2015 census, Lanao del Sur\u2018s \npopulation  was  1,045,429  people,  of  which  the  Islamic  City  of  Marawi  accounted  for  201,785 \npeople. With 71.9% of the population below the poverty line, Lanao del Sur is the poorest province \nin the country. The region\u2019s economic performance has been poor, with ARMM\u2019s economic growth \nrate averaging 2.0% annually between 2011 and 2017 compared with the average annual growth \nrate of 6.2% for the national economy. Extreme poverty combined with the lack of basic services \nand  poor  governance  has  exacerbated  long-standing  conflicts  in  the  region,  including  the \nBangsamoro struggle for self-determination led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro \nNational Liberation Front, and the ideological struggle of the Communist Party of the Philippines, \nNew People\u2019s Army, and the National Democratic Front. \n \nOn 23 May 2017, Marawi was occupied by combined terrorist forces of the Maute group, \n4. \nthe Abu Sayyaf group, and foreign jihadists. The ensuing armed conflict between the responding \ngovernment security forces and the Maute group continued for 5 months, with heavy artillery used \non both sides and air bombing by the government forces. On 17 October 2017, the government \nannounced  the  end  of  the  siege  and  declared the  city  liberated  from  terrorist  forces,  although \nmartial  law  remains  in  place  in  Mindanao.  For  10  months  after  the  siege  ended,  intermittent \nclashes  between  armed  groups  and  the  government  security  forces  continued  around  the \nprovince, delaying the shift from emergency humanitarian assistance to reconstruction of public \nand  private  assets  (para.  14).  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  worked  closely  with  the \nTaskforce  Bangon  Marawi  (TFBM), 4 the  Office  of  Civil  Defense,  the  National  Economic  and \n\n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority \u2013 Regional Development Office. 2018. \n\nBangon Marawi Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Program. Manila. \n\n4   Administrative  Order  3  (28  June  2017)  created  the  Taskforce  Bangon  Marawi  (TFBM),  an  interagency  group  to \nfacilitate  recovery  efforts  in  Marawi.  Administrative  Order  9  (17  October  2017)  transferred  the  TFBM  to  civilian \nauthority led by the chair of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. Memorandum Circular No. \n4 (23 November 2017) assigned NEDA to lead the formulation of the BMCRRP with representatives from the Marawi \nand Lanao del Sur local government units and ARMM.  \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment  Authority  (NEDA),  and  development  partners  (DPs)  to  produce  the  post-conflict \ndamage and needs assessment (PCNA), which was completed in December 2017.5 The PCNA \nprovided  the  basis  for  the  preparation  of  the  BMCRRP,  which  was finalized  by  NEDA  in  June \n2018  after  extensive  consultations  with  local  and  national  stakeholders,  endorsed  by  the \ngovernment in July 2018, and presented to DPs in August and September 2018.  \n \n5. \nThe  BMCRRP  estimates  the  total  cost  of  reconstructing  public  infrastructure  and  the \nneeds for social and economic recovery at \u20b147.2 billion ($882 million equivalent) covering 744 \nPPA in six areas: local governance and peace building, housing and settlement, business and \nlivelihood, physical infrastructure, social services, and land resource management (footnote 3). \nNot included in the BMCRRP, the government has estimated the costs of reconstructing public \ninfrastructure in the city\u2019s central business district, referred to as the most affected area of Marawi \n(MAA), at $325 million, and another $375 million of potential budget obligations arising from the \nproposed  compensation  bill  for  private  assets  currently  under  deliberation  in  the  Philippines \nCongress.  \n  \n\nTable 1: Selected Damage and Loss Indicators as of August 2018 \n\nHumanitarian \nPopulation displaceda \n   IDPs remaining displacedb \n          % remaining IDPs in evacuation centers and   \n       transitory sitesc \nNumber of confirmed civilian deaths \nProfile of IDPs \nGender \nChildren (under age of 17 years) \nVulnerable personsd  \nHouse and lot owner \nDamaged or destroyed property \nHouses \nPublic buildings \nPublic schools \n\nHealth facilities \n\nDamaged infrastructure and productive assets \nTransport (e.g., roads, bridges) \nWater supply and distribution assets \n\nPower networks \n\nNUMBER OF PERSONS \n369,196 \n73,266 \n13.0% \n\n270 \nDisplaced populationd \n54% female, 46% male \n34% \n20% \n58% \nUnits \n5,627 \n1 municipal hall, 1 public market \n61 elementary schools, 8 high schools, 10 madrasas or \ntorils (Islamic school) \n1 hospital, 5 rural health units, 15 barangay (village) \nhealth stations \nUnits \n131 (73.8 km) of city roads, 3 bridges \n3 pumping stations, 354 cluster boxes, 15,350 km \npipelines  \n30.4 km of distribution lines  \n\nIDP = internally displaced person, km = kilometer. \na  Based on estimated IDPs from 2018.

Bangon Marawi Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Program. Manila. \n \n6. \nThe humanitarian costs of the armed conflict are high. The siege resulted in an estimated \n369,196 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (Table 1). While tens of thousands of IDPs relocated \nto  safer  places  in  Mindanao,  many  of  the  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  IDPs  were  housed  in \n                                                \n5  Summary Assessment of Damage and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ntemporary settlement sites, placing severe pressure on underfunded social services. Lack of basic \nutilities and privacy in the temporary settlements as well as damage to infrastructure in Marawi \nhave  led  to  a  high  incidence  of  diseases  among  IDPs,  especially  children,  and  gender-based \nviolence. Over 100,000 school aged children are either not yet back at school or are at risk of \ndropping  out  of  school  because  of  distances  from  their  schools  and  unaffordable  cost  of \nschooling.6 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that about 13% of the \nremaining IDPs reside in evacuation centers or temporary settlement sites as of end of August \n2018. One-fifth of the remaining IDPs are highly vulnerable\u2014elderly, families headed by women, \nsingle  parents,  pregnant  and  lactating  mothers,  newborn  babies,  people  with  disabilities,  and \nseparated children\u2014all in need of assistance and livelihoods.  \n \n7. \nEconomic and fiscal costs. The conflict\u2019s economic impact has devastated the city and \nthe province as they rely on agriculture and trading services. Preliminary ADB estimates suggest \nthat the Lanao de Sur economy significantly contracted in 2017 and 2018. Displaced farmers and \ndestroyed schools, hospitals, and markets will hold back economic recovery, and the Lanao del \nSur  economy  is  likely  to  stagnate  in  2019  without  substantial  recovery  assistance.  With  the \nARMM\u2019s average per capita regional gross domestic product of \u20b127,000 ($508) in 2016 (current \nprices), Lanao del Sur does not have the resources to overcome this conflict on its own. These \neconomic  and  social  costs  have  created  huge  pressure  on  the  national  government\u2019s  fiscal \nsituation, as the government estimates the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Marawi at \n$1.6 billion during 2018-2022, of which $882 million is covered under the BMCRRP (para 5).  \n \n8. \nPoverty incidence in Lanao del Sur. ADB simulations of the impact of the armed conflict \nsuggest  that  the  number  of  people  below  the  poverty  line  could  increase  by  approximately \n152,000  by  2019  (with  poverty  incidence  increasing  from  71.9%  to  86.4%)  because  of  the \nmagnitude  of  the  damage  in  Marawi,  the  sizeable  number  of  IDPs,  the  destruction  in  public \ninfrastructure and services, and the high number of families that were already vulnerable to falling \ninto poverty before the conflict (Table 2). Many families will adopt strategies to escape poverty or \nmitigate the risk of falling into poverty, such as migrating to safer locations. Thus, actual poverty \nrates could be lower than those projected in Table 2. Nevertheless, the incidence of poverty and \nthe depth of poverty in Lanao del Sur will remain elevated at crisis levels for some time, as many \nfamilies have lost income-generating assets. \n \n\nTable 2: Estimated Number of the Poor because of the Marawi Conflict \n\n \n \n \nLocation \nLanao del Sur \nARMM \nMindanao \n\nNo. of Population \n(2015) \n1,045,429 \n3,781,387 \n     23,775,775 \n\nNo. of the \nPoor \n(2015) \n751,663 \n\n     2,030,605 \n     8,606,831 \n\nPopulation in \nPoverty  \n(%, 2015) \n71.9 \n53.7 \n36.2 \n\nEstimated No. \nof the Poor \n(after the crisis) \n903,250 \n   2,182,192 \n   8,758,418 \n\nEstimated \nPopulation in \nPoverty  \n(%, after the crisis)\n86.4 \n57.7 \n36.8 \n\nNote: The 2015 poverty data are used as the benchmark since these data are the latest official poverty figures from \nthe Philippines Statistics Authority.

Initially, the security situation and the large-scale evacuation of \nthe city\u2019s population to other townships hampered relief operations during and in the immediate \naftermath of the conflict. However, the government responded quickly by first establishing in June \n                                                \n6 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OCHAPhilippines_Humanitarian_Bulletin_No9_October_2018_\n\nFINAL.pdfs; \n\n \n\n\f2017  the  interagency  TFBM  to  facilitate  recovery  efforts  and  coordinate  with  development \npartners  (footnote  4).  The  armed  forces  and  government  relief  agencies  responded  through \nimmediate  evacuation  and  relief  operations  that  provided  basic  temporary  settlement  sites  for \nIDPs, basic food supplies, water, and medical assistance. In 2018, relief operations continued for \nthe  remaining  IDPs  and  the  rehabilitation  of  some  basic  infrastructure  commenced.  The \ngovernment endorsed the BMCRRP in July 2018 and enacted the Bangsamoro Organic Law on \n26  July  2018,  which  aims  to  build  peace  and  strengthen  governance  and  development  in  the \nfuture Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Mindanao (BARM).7 \n \n10. \nEmergency  assistance  coordination.  The  government  officially  requested  ADB  and \nWorld Bank for advisory support to the TFBM in September 2017. In response, ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department established a One ADB team, which coordinated with and provided support to \nthe  government  and  DPs.  ADB  also  approved  a  small-scale  technical  assistance grant,  under \nwhich it engaged 13 national experts to provide continuous on-the-ground support to the TFBM. \nThe World Bank has worked closely with the government and proposes to establish a multi-DP \ntrust fund to finance a BMCRRP monitoring system. The Government of Australia is considering \ncontributing to the trust fund and is providing direct assistance for Marawi recovery and education \nsupport  for  children  affected  by  the  crisis.  The  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency) has indicated it will provide a combination of loans and grants \nof $136 million equivalent to finance the rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads. The United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID) has reallocated approximately $21 million \nin  grants to  support  relief  and rehabilitation of  small-scale infrastructure and launched the  $25 \nmillion Marawi Response Project in September 2018 supporting livelihoods and social cohesion.8 \n \nStructure  and  modality  of  ADB\u2019s  emergency  assistance  loan.  The  ERRM  is  an \n11. \nintegral part of ADB\u2019s commitment to the government to support recovery in Marawi. On 31 August \n2018, immediately after the adoption of the BMCRRP, the government officially requested ADB \nto provide emergency financial support for the recovery program through a combination of project \ninvestment  loans,  project  investment  grants,  and  quick-disbursing  support  to  the  BMCRRP. \nTherefore, the emergency assistance loan (EAL) will comprise (i) a quick-disbursing component \nof $300 million, and (ii) a project loan of $100 million. The ERRM will also include two grants for \na total of $8 million to restore basic services and livelihoods.  \n \n12. \nADB  assessed  different  lending  modalities  to  determine  the  best  way  to  help  the \ngovernment respond to the BMCRRP\u2019s urgent needs. The decision to select the EAL was based \non two factors. First, the quick-disbursing support is appropriate because of the need to mitigate \nthe  severe  economic  and  social  impacts  and  facilitate  recovery.  Directing  a  portion  of  funds \nthrough  government  channels  enables  the  government  to  take  ownership  of  the  emergency \nresponse and initiatives. A substantial share of the PPA-linked expenditures in the BMCRRP are \nsmall scale and will be implemented through national, provincial, and local government units and \ntherefore  it  is  more  effective  that  such  funds  are  channeled  through  the  government  budget.9 \nSecond, international studies show that the speed of aid is critical in lifting victims out of extreme \npoverty on a sustainable basis through timely and high-quality rehabilitation and reconstruction of \n\n                                                \n7  The Bangsamoro Organic Law provides the basic structure of government for BARM following agreements set out \n \nin the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro Peace Agreement signed between the government and the \n  Moro Islamic Liberation Front in 2014. A plebiscite planned for January 2019 will be held to ratify the law creating the \n  proposed BARM and formally abolishing the current ARMM. \n8  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  H.

Washington, DC: ADB. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\npublic and private assets and restoration of livelihoods.10 The ERRM complements the objectives \nof  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2018\u20132023,  which  include  reducing  poverty  in \nMindanao.11 The  ERRM  will  provide  short-term  assistance  to  mitigate  the  adverse  impacts  on \naffected people in Marawi and surrounding municipalities, and ADB\u2019s CPS provides development \nassistance  in  Mindanao  (including  ARMM)  through  infrastructure  investments  during  the  CPS \nperiod. The ERRM is consistent with Strategy 2030 particularly with operating priorities on poverty \nreduction and gender equality.12 \n \nThe  ERRM  meets  all  five  eligibility  criteria  and  six  characteristics  required  for  an  EAL \n13. \nunder ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (DEAP).13 The use of the EAL to support \nthe government\u2019s financing of PPA under the BMCRRP is consistent with ADB\u2019s DEAP because \nthese  PPA  represent  the  immediate  support  needed  for  recovery  and  reconstruction  in  post-\nconflict Marawi. The policy stresses that EALs are designed to help rebuild high-priority physical \nassets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies rather than be \nused for comprehensive, long-term reconstruction. \n \n14.  While the siege of Marawi ended in October 2017, the ERRM is considered short-term \nassistance in line with the DEAP. Prolonged instability in Marawi and in Lanao del Sur delayed \nthe government\u2019s  shift from  emergency  humanitarian assistance to  reconstruction  efforts  by  at \nleast  10  months.  Clearing  of  unexploded  ordnance  and  more  than  1  million  tons  of  debris  in \nMarawi added to this delay. By October 2018, little infrastructure in Marawi had been rebuilt, most \nbasic  utilities  were  not  operational,  and  damaged  public  markets  had  not  restarted.  In  the \nmeantime, the majority of IDPs have returned to Marawi, placing extreme pressure on public and \nsocial services. This situation reflects the fact that post-conflict situations are more complex than \nnatural disasters. Lessons learned from other post-conflict situations show that each is unique, \nand the priority, timing, appropriateness, and execution of tasks will vary each time (footnote 10). \nDepending on the fragility of a post-conflict situation, reconstruction efforts may only commence \n12\u201324 months after security has been restored, clearing of ordnance and debris is completed, \nbasic institutions and governance are reestablished, and a political consensus on the recovery \nprogram  is  achieved.14 In Marawi,  long-standing  political  conflicts  and  intense  power  dynamics \nbetween family  clans,  combined with the complex  ARMM  governance  setting and  the  ongoing \ntransition to the BARM, mean it has taken longer to achieve political consensus on the BMCRRP \namong  critical  local  stakeholders.  The  government  is  cognizant  of  the  fact  that  excluding  the \nparticipation of local people in Marawi regarding what infrastructure the community requires can \nreignite economic and social tensions.15 Broad consensus with stakeholders on the list of PPA \nwas only achieved and led to the final endorsement of the BMCRRP by the national government \nin July 2018 (para. 4). With IDPs now returning to Marawi, the government, local stakeholders, \nand development partners consider time is of the essence in implementing the BMCRRP. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n10 Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies.  2002.

Quick-disbursing  support  for  the  recovery  program  implemented.  The \nquick-disbursing component will finance eligible expenditures of non-infrastructure related PPA in \nthe BMCRRP. The aim is to ensure the restoration of service delivery in education and health, \nscaling  up  of  social  assistance  programs,  employment  assistance  and  training  programs, \nbusiness  and  livelihood  programs,  housing-related  cash  assistance,  and  capacity  building  and \ntraining related to local governance and peace building. Table 3 provides details of the positive \nlist of expenditure categories that will be financed by the ERRM. This includes up to 449 PPA for \nan estimated cost of \u20b122.8 billion. The quick-disbursing component may also be used to finance \npersonnel  and  operations  and  maintenance  costs  for  education,  health,  and  social  welfare  in \nLanao  del  Sur,  ARMM.  The  ADB,  working  with  the  government,  has  designed  a  monitoring \nframework and financial management arrangements to enhance financial accountability.16 First, \nthe implementation of the BMCRRP will include a rigorous monitoring framework overseen by the \nTFBM  through  the  establishment  of  a  project  management  office.  Second,  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements for output 1 will use the government\u2019s public financial management \nsystems to track and report on budgetary disbursements made on eligible PPA expenditures. This \nwill  include  the  DOF  submitting  to  ADB  certification  that  output  1  will  only  be  used for  eligible \nexpenditures and an audited statement of eligible expenditures for each fiscal year, as set out in \nthe draft loan agreement (para 26). ADB will provide separate technical assistance support for \nimplementing the financial management arrangements and monitoring of output 1.  \n \n\nTable 3: Quick-Disbursing Component: Eligible Expenditures Under the Bangon Marawi \nComprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Program  \n\n \n \nExpenditure Categories \n(Positive List) \n1.

Connectivity  reestablished.  Reestablishing  physical  connectivity  within \nMarawi and Lanao del Sur is critically important for accelerating social and economic recovery. \nThis  output  will  assist  the  government  in  rebuilding  infrastructure  damaged  during  the  armed \nconflict. Specifically, the output will finance the Department of Public Works and Highway (DPWH) \nlarger-scale  infrastructure  projects  included  in  the  BMCRRP  covering  the  repair,  upgrade, \nrehabilitation,  construction,  and  related  improvement  of  roads,  bridges,  and  drainage.  This \nincludes  the  construction  of  about  25  kilometers  of  roads  and  1,700  meters  of  bridges  and \nviaducts.  All  infrastructure will  be  rebuilt to a  higher  standard,  will  be  climate  resilient,  and will \nincorporate gender-responsive and inclusive physical design features to make them safer for use \nby women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. \n \nOutput 3. Water utilities and health infrastructure restored. This output will rehabilitate \n18. \npublic  water  utilities and health infrastructure.  Under  the  water  component, reconstruction  and \nrehabilitation of infrastructure will be financed within the area of the existing water supply system, \ncomprising 19 barangays (villages) currently serviced by the Marawi city water district, and will \ndevelop a comprehensive water supply, septage and sewerage, and drainage master plan for the \ncity. This plan will be informed by local consultations ensuring participation of women\u2019s groups. \nUnder the health component, two local health units (clinics) will be constructed\u2014one in Marawi \nand one in Piagapo\u2014as model health units that meet or exceed national standards. The  well-\nequipped  units  will  have  climate-resilient  features  (solar  powered  refrigeration),  have  birthing \nfacilities,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation.  The  output  will  also  provide  mobile  health  facilities \n(three mobile health clinics, two ambulances, two patient transport vehicles, and one monitoring \nvehicle) to restore essential health services, including reproductive health services, to Marawi and \nsurrounding areas hosting IDPs. This entire output will be financed by the UCCRTF grant. \n \n19. \nOutput 4. Social services and livelihoods support improved. This output will improve \nsocial services and livelihoods of affected people. First, it will scale up delivery of the Department \nof Labor and Employment (DOLE) Emergency Employment Program in Marawi and municipalities \nby providing cash-for-work assistance to approximately 2,400 beneficiaries. Second, it will support \napproximately  1,200  beneficiaries  in  accessing  livelihood  programs,  patterned  on  the  DOLE \nIntegrated  Livelihood  Program  and  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  (DTI)  Shared  Services \nFacility Program. Third, it will restore quality education by equipping the Department of Education \n(DepEd)  schools  and  temporary  learning  spaces  with  furniture  and  learning  and  teaching \nmaterials; providing capacity development for teachers to offer gender-responsive psycho-social \nsupport for children, youth, and their families; and supporting culture- and gender-sensitive peace \neducation. The entire output will be financed by the JFPR grant.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  ERRM  is  estimated  to  cost  $439.6  million  (Table  4).  Detailed  cost  estimates  by \n20. \nexpenditure category and by financier for outputs 2\u20134 are included in the project administration \nmanuals (PAMs).17  \n \nThe government has requested two regular loans with an aggregate of $400 million from \n21. \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, of which a $300 million loan will finance output 1 and a $100 \nmillion loan will finance output 2. Both loans will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of \n8 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manuals (Outputs 2, 3, and 4) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  custom-tailored \nrepayment method, the average maturity is 19 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB \nis 0.2% per year. The government has made its own independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility and has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on the \nbasis  of  any  advice  from  ADB.  The  financing  under  the  quick-disbursing  component  will  be \nwithdrawn upon loan effectiveness in multiple installments from 2019 based on the withdrawal \napplication accompanied by a certification (para 16). The UCCRTF under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $5 million, to be administered by \nADB to finance output 3, and the JFPR will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $3 million, to \nbe administered by ADB, to finance output 4. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \n\nQuick-disbursing support for the recovery program implemented \nConnectivity reestablished \nWater utilities and health infrastructure restored \nSocial services and livelihoods support improved \n\nBase Costb \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \nSubtotal (A) \nContingenciesc \nFinancial Charges During Implementationd \n \n\nTotal (A+B+C) \n\n \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\n300.0 \n115.4 \n4.7 \n2.9 \n423.0 \n6.8 \n9.8 \n439.6 \n\nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely due to rounding. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $15.4 million.

The implementing agency for output 3 will be the LWUA. \nOne firm will be recruited by the LWUA using direct contracting for master planning and civil works, \nwhile  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  LWUA\u2019s  PMU  for  project  design, \nsupervision, and management. The implementing consultant for output 4 will be Save the Children \nPhilippines,  a  nongovernment  organization,  which  will  be  recruited  by  the  DPWH  using  direct \ncontracting. Consultant support will be provided to the DPWH for overseeing the implementation \nof  the  Outputs  2  to  4.  Output  2  will  be  implemented  over  a  5-year  period,  considering  the \nexceptional  level  of  reconstruction  required  and  the  complex  local  context  for  project \nimplementation. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 6 and described in \ndetail in the respective PAMs (footnote 17), including justification for direct contracting of the civil \nworks and services under outputs 2, 3, and 4. \n \n25.   Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in a manner consistent with \nthe simplified and expedient procedures permitted under the DEAP and the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Relaxation of open competitive bidding requirements for \nworks and goods with an abbreviated bidding and evaluation period will expedite contract awards \nunder the project (as detailed in the PAMs). For output 2, during project implementation the DPWH \nwill screen, prepare, and appraise the subprojects to be financed under the loan with support from \nthe  loan-financed  consultants.  Discussions  will  be  held  with  IDPs  and  local  stakeholders  to \nconfirm the subprojects, ensure ownership, and maximize benefits. The steering committee will \nreview and select the list of subprojects, based on subproject selection criteria agreed between \nthe DPWH and ADB, and are described in the PAM and in the draft loan agreement. \n \n26. \nThe ADB Board of Directors is requested to waive the requirement under the DEAP that \nthe quick-disbursing component finances only a list of identified imports necessary for effective \nrecovery  assistance.  The  quick-disbursing  component  will  enable  the  government  to  generate \ncounterpart funds in pesos in the equivalent of the loan proceeds, which will be used to directly \nfinance eligible expenditures of the BMCRRP and recurrent expenditures in Lanao del Sur, ARMM \n(para. 16) instead of direct procurement of goods. Disbursement and related arrangements for \nthe quick-disbursing component will follow ADB\u2019s policies and procedures applicable to  policy-\nbased  lending  based  on  the  list  of  ineligible  items19 and  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).20 \n \n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017.

During  ERRM \nimplementation, the design consultants will prepare an economic analysis of the subprojects for \noutput 2 and output 3, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.21 Only \neconomically viable projects will be financed. Most project outputs are  non-revenue-generating \npublic services (roads, schools, and health centers) with no cost recovery, and hence no financial \nviability assessment is required for these outputs. In 2017, ADB reviewed the funding available \nfor  road  maintenance  by  the  DPWH  and  concluded  that  it  was  reasonable  to  expect  that  the \ngovernment  will  provide  enough  financing  for  the  maintenance  of  ADB-financed  roads  in \nMindanao (footnote 18). The government has continued in 2018 to quickly increase the DPWH \nallocations for road maintenance and will do so again in 2019. The financial sustainability analysis \nfor all outputs will be completed within 6 months of project implementation. For the water supply \ncomponent,  a  financial  viability  assessment  will  be  conducted  within  6  months  of  project \nimplementation.  The  government\u2019s  commitment  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  all  project \nfacilities and assets are included as covenants in loan and grant agreements. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  government  continues  to  strengthen  its  public  financial  management  system.  The \n2017 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment confirmed that three of the seven \ncore  areas\u2014transparency,  policy-based  budgeting,  and  asset\u2013liability  management\u2014have \nimproved and are now considered strong. Areas of weakness\u2014budget credibility, predictability \nand  control  in  budget  execution,  and  audit\u2014are  being  actively  addressed  by  the  government. \nHowever, given the nature of emergency projects, the financial management risk for the ERRM \nis  high.  The  financial  management  assessments  are  substantially  complete  and  will  be \ncontinuously updated during implementation. The financial management action plan, drafted to \nmitigate  the  risks,  will  be  closely  monitored  during  implementation.  Besides  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements described in para. 16 and footnote 16, the Commission on Audit will \ncarry  out  a  special  audit  focusing  on  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability  at  the \ncompletion of the ERRM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  DOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are in the PAMs (footnote 17). \n \nC. \n \n29. \nThe ERRM  will directly  contribute to poverty reduction, inclusive growth, and the social \ndevelopment  goals  by  reconstructing  much-needed  infrastructure,  restoring  essential  services, \nand  reviving  livelihood  opportunities  for  thousands  of  people  in  the  conflict-affected  areas  of \nMarawi  and  surrounding  municipalities.  The  ERRM  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming at entry. The gender action plan includes proactive measures to ensure (i) equal \nopportunity  for  men  and  women  in  employment  and  livelihood  opportunities;  and  (ii)  gender \nresponsiveness  of  peace  education,  psycho-social  support,  local  water  supply,  sewerage  and \ndrainage master plans, and infrastructure. 22 \n \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2017.

The  quick-\ndisbursing component under output 1 will not include activities that lead to safeguard implications \nwithin  the  meaning  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS). 23  However,  if  the  quick-\ndisbursing support is used for any activity with safeguard impacts, ADB\u2019s SPS requirements will \napply,  including  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  frameworks  (EARF)  and  combined \nresettlement and ethnic minority development frameworks (REMDF) prepared for output 2. \n \n31. \nOutputs 2 and 3 have safeguard implications, which are covered under two sets of EARF \nand  REMDF  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  Frameworks  instead  of  individual \nsafeguard  plans  have  been  prepared  as  the  DEAP  allows  for  procedural  flexibility  in  the \napplication  of  the  safeguard  requirements.  Individual  plans  will  be  prepared  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n32. \nOutput  2  will  have  significant  safeguard  implications  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \nnonsignificant  implications  for  indigenous  peoples  and  environment.  Output  2  will  include \nupgrading  and  reconstruction  of  existing  roads  and  trails,  bridges,  other  roads,  and  drainage. \nWorks will be within the existing rights of way. However, land acquisition and resettlement may \nbe  necessary  and  may  generate  significant  impacts.  An  REMDF  has  been  prepared  and \nResettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plans  (REMDP)  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented \nthe \ncategorization  will  be  reassessed  and,  if  impacts  under  involuntary  resettlement  are  deemed \nnonsignificant, the project will be recategorized; in which case the external monitor for involuntary \nresettlement will still be engaged given that this is a post-conflict environment.24 The proposed \nworks  are  not  anticipated  to  cause  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation. Environmental assessment reports will be prepared for subprojects \nconsistent with the EARF. \n \n33.   Output  3  has  minor  safeguard  implications.  Expected  land  requirements  are  limited  to \nsmall  parcels  of  land.  An  REMDF  has  been  prepared  to  address  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguard impacts and a REMDP will be prepared and implemented for subprojects consistent \nwith  the  REMDF.  The  project  activities  are  mainly  damaged  infrastructure  in  built-up  areas  of \nMarawi city. Works are not anticipated to be carried out in environmentally sensitive areas, and \nno  significant  adverse  environmental  impact  is  expected  during  construction  and  operation. \nEnvironmental  assessment  reports  will  be  prepared for  subprojects  consistent  with  the  EARF. \nOutput 4 has no major environment or involuntary resettlement impacts. An indigenous peoples \nplan  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  to  reflect  positive  impacts  on  affected \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE. \n\nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nThe  ERRM  has  three  substantial  risks.25 Country-level  risks  include  weaknesses  in  the \n34. \npublic financial management system and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the government has \n                                                \n23 Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Frameworks  and  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  People  Planning \n\nfor  subprojects  consistent  with \n\nthe  REMDF.

To  reduce \ncorruption  risks,  the  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  of  the  Philippines \nimplemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan (footnote 16). Two \ncontextual risks are (i) recurrence of conflicts (ADB will continue to closely monitor the security \nsituation  and  coordinate  with  government  agencies),  and  (ii)  lack  of  coordination  in  recovery \nefforts. ADB and other DPs will coordinate monitoring with the government through the TFBM. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n35. \nThe  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  ERRM  shall  conform  to  all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAMs and loan \ndocuments.
