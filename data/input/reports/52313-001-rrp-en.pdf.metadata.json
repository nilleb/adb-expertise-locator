THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Emergency Assistance for Reconstruction and Recovery \nof Marawi (ERRM). The report also describes the proposed administration of (i) a grant to be \nprovided by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility;1 and (ii) a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants.2 \n \n2.  The ERRM is structured to provide the Government of the Philippines with immediate and \nflexible financing to implement programs, projects, and activities (PPA) included in the Bangon \nMarawi  Comprehensive  Rehabilitation  and  Recovery  Program  (BMCRRP). 3  The  ERRM \ncomprises four outputs: (i) a quick-disbursing component to finance eligible expenditures of PPA \nin the BMCRRP, (ii) reestablishing connectivity in Marawi and its vicinity by rebuilding better public \ninfrastructure, (iii) restoring water utilities and health infrastructure, and (iv) improving social \nservices for and livelihoods of the affected people. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  The  Islamic  City  of  Marawi  is  the  capital  of  the  province  of  Lanao  del  Sur  in  the \nAutonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). According to the 2015 census, Lanao del Sur\u2018s \npopulation was 1,045,429 people, of which the Islamic City of Marawi accounted for 201,785 \npeople. With 71.9% of the population below the poverty line, Lanao del Sur is the poorest province \nin the country. The region\u2019s economic performance has been poor, with ARMM\u2019s economic growth \nrate averaging 2.0% annually between 2011 and 2017 compared with the average annual growth \nrate of 6.2% for the national economy. Extreme poverty combined with the lack of basic services \nand  poor  governance  has  exacerbated  long-standing  conflicts  in  the  region,  including  the \nBangsamoro struggle for self-determination led by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro \nNational Liberation Front, and the ideological struggle of the Communist Party of the Philippines, \nNew People\u2019s Army, and the National Democratic Front. \n \n4.  On 23 May 2017, Marawi was occupied by combined terrorist forces of the Maute group, \nthe Abu Sayyaf group, and foreign jihadists. The ensuing armed conflict between the responding \ngovernment security forces and the Maute group continued for 5 months, with heavy artillery used \non both sides and air bombing by the government forces. On 17 October 2017, the government \nannounced the end of the siege and declared the city liberated from terrorist forces, although \nmartial law remains in place in Mindanao. For 10 months after the siege ended, intermittent \nclashes  between  armed  groups  and  the  government  security  forces  continued  around  the \nprovince, delaying the shift from emergency humanitarian assistance to reconstruction of public \nand private assets (para. 14). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) worked closely with the \nTaskforce Bangon Marawi (TFBM),4 the Office of Civil Defense, the National Economic and \n                                                \n1 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority \u2013 Regional Development Office. 2018. \nBangon Marawi Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Program. Manila. \n4  Administrative Order 3 (28 June 2017) created the Taskforce Bangon Marawi (TFBM), an interagency group to \nfacilitate recovery efforts in Marawi. Administrative Order 9 (17 October 2017) transferred the TFBM to civilian \nauthority led by the chair of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council. Memorandum Circular No. \n4 (23 November 2017) assigned NEDA to lead the formulation of the BMCRRP with representatives from the Marawi \nand Lanao del Sur local government units and ARMM.  \n ", "2 \nDevelopment Authority (NEDA), and development partners (DPs) to produce the post-conflict \ndamage and needs assessment (PCNA), which was completed in December 2017.5 The PCNA \nprovided the basis for the preparation of the BMCRRP, which was finalized by NEDA in June \n2018  after  extensive  consultations  with  local  and  national  stakeholders,  endorsed  by  the \ngovernment in July 2018, and presented to DPs in August and September 2018.  \n \n5.  The BMCRRP estimates the total cost of reconstructing public infrastructure and the \nneeds for social and economic recovery at \u20b147.2 billion ($882 million equivalent) covering 744 \nPPA in six areas: local governance and peace building, housing and settlement, business and \nlivelihood, physical infrastructure, social services, and land resource management (footnote 3). \nNot included in the BMCRRP, the government has estimated the costs of reconstructing public \ninfrastructure in the city\u2019s central business district, referred to as the most affected area of Marawi \n(MAA), at $325 million, and another $375 million of potential budget obligations arising from the \nproposed compensation bill for private assets currently under deliberation in the Philippines \nCongress.  \n  \nTable 1: Selected Damage and Loss Indicators as of August 2018 \nHumanitarian  NUMBER OF PERSONS \nPopulation displaceda  369,196 \n   IDPs remaining displacedb  73,266 \n          % remaining IDPs in evacuation centers and    13.0% \n       transitory sitesc \nNumber of confirmed civilian deaths  270 \nProfile of IDPs  Displaced populationd \nGender  54% female, 46% male \nChildren (under age of 17 years)  34% \nVulnerable personsd   20% \nHouse and lot owner  58% \nDamaged or destroyed property  Units \nHouses  5,627 \nPublic buildings  1 municipal hall, 1 public market \nPublic schools  61 elementary schools, 8 high schools, 10 madrasas or \ntorils (Islamic school) \nHealth facilities  1 hospital, 5 rural health units, 15 barangay (village) \nhealth stations \nDamaged infrastructure and productive assets  Units \nTransport (e.g., roads, bridges)  131 (73.8 km) of city roads, 3 bridges \nWater supply and distribution assets  3 pumping stations, 354 cluster boxes, 15,350 km \npipelines  \nPower networks  30.4 km of distribution lines  \nIDP = internally displaced person, km = kilometer. \na  Based on estimated IDPs from 2018.

The siege resulted in an estimated \n369,196 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (Table 1). While tens of thousands of IDPs relocated \nto safer places in Mindanao, many of the poorer and more vulnerable IDPs were housed in \n                                                \n5  Summary Assessment of Damage and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \ntemporary settlement sites, placing severe pressure on underfunded social services. Lack of basic \nutilities and privacy in the temporary settlements as well as damage to infrastructure in Marawi \nhave led to a high incidence of diseases among IDPs, especially children, and gender-based \nviolence. Over 100,000 school aged children are either not yet back at school or are at risk of \ndropping  out  of  school  because  of  distances  from  their  schools  and  unaffordable  cost  of \nschooling.6 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that about 13% of the \nremaining IDPs reside in evacuation centers or temporary settlement sites as of end of August \n2018. One-fifth of the remaining IDPs are highly vulnerable\u2014elderly, families headed by women, \nsingle parents, pregnant and lactating mothers, newborn babies, people with disabilities, and \nseparated children\u2014all in need of assistance and livelihoods.  \n \n7.  Economic and fiscal costs. The conflict\u2019s economic impact has devastated the city and \nthe province as they rely on agriculture and trading services. Preliminary ADB estimates suggest \nthat the Lanao de Sur economy significantly contracted in 2017 and 2018. Displaced farmers and \ndestroyed schools, hospitals, and markets will hold back economic recovery, and the Lanao del \nSur economy is likely to stagnate in 2019 without substantial recovery assistance. With the \nARMM\u2019s average per capita regional gross domestic product of \u20b127,000 ($508) in 2016 (current \nprices), Lanao del Sur does not have the resources to overcome this conflict on its own. These \neconomic and social costs have created huge pressure on the national government\u2019s fiscal \nsituation, as the government estimates the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Marawi at \n$1.6 billion during 2018-2022, of which $882 million is covered under the BMCRRP (para 5).  \n \n8.  Poverty incidence in Lanao del Sur. ADB simulations of the impact of the armed conflict \nsuggest that the number of people below the poverty line could increase by approximately \n152,000 by 2019 (with poverty incidence increasing from 71.9% to 86.4%) because of the \nmagnitude of the damage in Marawi, the sizeable number of IDPs, the destruction in public \ninfrastructure and services, and the high number of families that were already vulnerable to falling \ninto poverty before the conflict (Table 2). Many families will adopt strategies to escape poverty or \nmitigate the risk of falling into poverty, such as migrating to safer locations. Thus, actual poverty \nrates could be lower than those projected in Table 2. Nevertheless, the incidence of poverty and \nthe depth of poverty in Lanao del Sur will remain elevated at crisis levels for some time, as many \nfamilies have lost income-generating assets. \n \nTable 2: Estimated Number of the Poor because of the Marawi Conflict \n  Estimated \n  No. of the  Population in  Estimated No.  Population in \n  No. of Population  Poor  Poverty   of the Poor  Poverty  \nLocation  (2015)  (2015)  (%, 2015)  (after the crisis)  (%, after the crisis)\nLanao del Sur  1,045,429  751,663  71.9  903,250  86.4 \nARMM  3,781,387       2,030,605  53.7     2,182,192  57.7 \nMindanao       23,775,775       8,606,831  36.2     8,758,418  36.8 \nNote: The 2015 poverty data are used as the benchmark since these data are the latest official poverty figures from \nthe Philippines Statistics Authority.

Government\u2019s actions. Initially, the security situation and the large-scale evacuation of \nthe city\u2019s population to other townships hampered relief operations during and in the immediate \naftermath of the conflict. However, the government responded quickly by first establishing in June \n                                                \n6 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OCHAPhilippines_Humanitarian_Bulletin_No9_October_2018_\nFINAL.pdfs; \n ", "4 \n2017  the  interagency TFBM  to facilitate  recovery  efforts  and  coordinate  with  development \npartners (footnote 4). The armed forces and government relief agencies responded through \nimmediate evacuation and relief operations that provided basic temporary settlement sites for \nIDPs, basic food supplies, water, and medical assistance. In 2018, relief operations continued for \nthe  remaining  IDPs  and  the  rehabilitation  of  some  basic  infrastructure  commenced.  The \ngovernment endorsed the BMCRRP in July 2018 and enacted the Bangsamoro Organic Law on \n26 July 2018, which aims to build peace and strengthen governance and development in the \nfuture Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Mindanao (BARM).7 \n \n10.  Emergency assistance coordination. The government officially requested ADB and \nWorld Bank for advisory support to the TFBM in September 2017. In response, ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department established a One ADB team, which coordinated with and provided support to \nthe government and DPs. ADB also approved a small-scale technical assistance grant, under \nwhich it engaged 13 national experts to provide continuous on-the-ground support to the TFBM. \nThe World Bank has worked closely with the government and proposes to establish a multi-DP \ntrust fund to finance a BMCRRP monitoring system. The Government of Australia is considering \ncontributing to the trust fund and is providing direct assistance for Marawi recovery and education \nsupport  for  children  affected  by  the  crisis.  The  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency) has indicated it will provide a combination of loans and grants \nof $136 million equivalent to finance the rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads. The United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID) has reallocated approximately $21 million \nin grants to support relief and rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure and launched the $25 \nmillion Marawi Response Project in September 2018 supporting livelihoods and social cohesion.8 \n \n11.  Structure and modality of ADB\u2019s emergency assistance loan. The ERRM is an \nintegral part of ADB\u2019s commitment to the government to support recovery in Marawi. On 31 August \n2018, immediately after the adoption of the BMCRRP, the government officially requested ADB \nto provide emergency financial support for the recovery program through a combination of project \ninvestment loans, project investment grants, and quick-disbursing support to the BMCRRP. \nTherefore, the emergency assistance loan (EAL) will comprise (i) a quick-disbursing component \nof $300 million, and (ii) a project loan of $100 million. The ERRM will also include two grants for \na total of $8 million to restore basic services and livelihoods.  \n \n12.  ADB  assessed  different  lending  modalities  to  determine  the  best  way  to  help  the \ngovernment respond to the BMCRRP\u2019s urgent needs. The decision to select the EAL was based \non two factors. First, the quick-disbursing support is appropriate because of the need to mitigate \nthe severe economic and social impacts and facilitate recovery. Directing a portion of funds \nthrough government channels enables the government to take ownership of the emergency \nresponse and initiatives. A substantial share of the PPA-linked expenditures in the BMCRRP are \nsmall scale and will be implemented through national, provincial, and local government units and \ntherefore it is more effective that such funds are channeled through the government budget.9 \nSecond, international studies show that the speed of aid is critical in lifting victims out of extreme \npoverty on a sustainable basis through timely and high-quality rehabilitation and reconstruction of \n                                                \n7  The Bangsamoro Organic Law provides the basic structure of government for BARM following agreements set out \n  in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro Peace Agreement signed between the government and the \n  Moro Islamic Liberation Front in 2014.

The ERRM is consistent with Strategy 2030 particularly with operating priorities on poverty \nreduction and gender equality.12 \n \n13.  The ERRM meets all five eligibility criteria and six characteristics required for an EAL \nunder ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (DEAP).13 The use of the EAL to support \nthe government\u2019s financing of PPA under the BMCRRP is consistent with ADB\u2019s DEAP because \nthese PPA represent the immediate support needed for recovery and reconstruction in post-\nconflict Marawi. The policy stresses that EALs are designed to help rebuild high-priority physical \nassets and restore economic, social, and governance activities after emergencies rather than be \nused for comprehensive, long-term reconstruction. \n \n14.  While the siege of Marawi ended in October 2017, the ERRM is considered short-term \nassistance in line with the DEAP. Prolonged instability in Marawi and in Lanao del Sur delayed \nthe government\u2019s shift from emergency humanitarian assistance to reconstruction efforts by at \nleast 10 months. Clearing of unexploded ordnance and more than 1 million tons of debris in \nMarawi added to this delay. By October 2018, little infrastructure in Marawi had been rebuilt, most \nbasic utilities were not operational, and damaged public markets had not restarted. In the \nmeantime, the majority of IDPs have returned to Marawi, placing extreme pressure on public and \nsocial services. This situation reflects the fact that post-conflict situations are more complex than \nnatural disasters. Lessons learned from other post-conflict situations show that each is unique, \nand the priority, timing, appropriateness, and execution of tasks will vary each time (footnote 10). \nDepending on the fragility of a post-conflict situation, reconstruction efforts may only commence \n12\u201324 months after security has been restored, clearing of ordnance and debris is completed, \nbasic institutions and governance are reestablished, and a political consensus on the recovery \nprogram is achieved.14 In Marawi, long-standing political conflicts and intense power dynamics \nbetween family clans, combined with the complex ARMM governance setting and the ongoing \ntransition to the BARM, mean it has taken longer to achieve political consensus on the BMCRRP \namong critical local stakeholders. The government is cognizant of the fact that excluding the \nparticipation of local people in Marawi regarding what infrastructure the community requires can \nreignite economic and social tensions.15 Broad consensus with stakeholders on the list of PPA \nwas only achieved and led to the final endorsement of the BMCRRP by the national government \nin July 2018 (para. 4). With IDPs now returning to Marawi, the government, local stakeholders, \nand development partners consider time is of the essence in implementing the BMCRRP. \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n10 Center  for  Strategic  and  International  Studies.  2002.

The ERRM is aligned with the following impact: social and economic recovery in Marawi \nachieved by 2023. The ERRM will have the following outcome: adverse social impact of the armed \nconflict on affected people mitigated. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1. Quick-disbursing support for the recovery program implemented. The \nquick-disbursing component will finance eligible expenditures of non-infrastructure related PPA in \nthe BMCRRP. The aim is to ensure the restoration of service delivery in education and health, \nscaling  up  of  social  assistance  programs,  employment  assistance  and  training  programs, \nbusiness and livelihood programs, housing-related cash assistance, and capacity building and \ntraining related to local governance and peace building. Table 3 provides details of the positive \nlist of expenditure categories that will be financed by the ERRM. This includes up to 449 PPA for \nan estimated cost of \u20b122.8 billion. The quick-disbursing component may also be used to finance \npersonnel and operations and maintenance costs for education, health, and social welfare in \nLanao del Sur, ARMM. The ADB, working with the government, has designed a monitoring \nframework and financial management arrangements to enhance financial accountability.16 First, \nthe implementation of the BMCRRP will include a rigorous monitoring framework overseen by the \nTFBM  through  the  establishment  of  a  project  management  office.  Second,  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements for output 1 will use the government\u2019s public financial management \nsystems to track and report on budgetary disbursements made on eligible PPA expenditures. This \nwill include the DOF submitting to ADB certification that output 1 will only be used for eligible \nexpenditures and an audited statement of eligible expenditures for each fiscal year, as set out in \nthe draft loan agreement (para 26). ADB will provide separate technical assistance support for \nimplementing the financial management arrangements and monitoring of output 1.  \n \nTable 3: Quick-Disbursing Component: Eligible Expenditures Under the Bangon Marawi \nComprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Program  \nNumber of \n  Programs,   \n  Projects,  Estimated \nExpenditure Categories  and  Expenditures \n(Positive List)  Activities  (\u20b1 million) \n1.

Output  2.  Connectivity  reestablished.  Reestablishing  physical  connectivity  within \nMarawi and Lanao del Sur is critically important for accelerating social and economic recovery. \nThis output will assist the government in rebuilding infrastructure damaged during the armed \nconflict. Specifically, the output will finance the Department of Public Works and Highway (DPWH) \nlarger-scale  infrastructure  projects  included  in  the  BMCRRP  covering  the  repair,  upgrade, \nrehabilitation,  construction,  and related  improvement  of roads,  bridges,  and  drainage.  This \nincludes the construction of about 25 kilometers of roads and 1,700 meters of bridges and \nviaducts. All infrastructure will be rebuilt to a higher standard, will be climate resilient, and will \nincorporate gender-responsive and inclusive physical design features to make them safer for use \nby women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. \n \n18.  Output 3. Water utilities and health infrastructure restored. This output will rehabilitate \npublic water utilities and health infrastructure. Under the water component, reconstruction and \nrehabilitation of infrastructure will be financed within the area of the existing water supply system, \ncomprising 19 barangays (villages) currently serviced by the Marawi city water district, and will \ndevelop a comprehensive water supply, septage and sewerage, and drainage master plan for the \ncity. This plan will be informed by local consultations ensuring participation of women\u2019s groups. \nUnder the health component, two local health units (clinics) will be constructed\u2014one in Marawi \nand one in Piagapo\u2014as model health units that meet or exceed national standards. The well-\nequipped units will have climate-resilient features (solar powered refrigeration), have birthing \nfacilities, and water supply and sanitation. The output will also provide mobile health facilities \n(three mobile health clinics, two ambulances, two patient transport vehicles, and one monitoring \nvehicle) to restore essential health services, including reproductive health services, to Marawi and \nsurrounding areas hosting IDPs. This entire output will be financed by the UCCRTF grant. \n \n19.  Output 4. Social services and livelihoods support improved. This output will improve \nsocial services and livelihoods of affected people. First, it will scale up delivery of the Department \nof Labor and Employment (DOLE) Emergency Employment Program in Marawi and municipalities \nby providing cash-for-work assistance to approximately 2,400 beneficiaries. Second, it will support \napproximately 1,200 beneficiaries in accessing livelihood programs, patterned on the DOLE \nIntegrated Livelihood Program and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Shared Services \nFacility Program. Third, it will restore quality education by equipping the Department of Education \n(DepEd)  schools  and  temporary  learning  spaces  with  furniture  and  learning  and  teaching \nmaterials; providing capacity development for teachers to offer gender-responsive psycho-social \nsupport for children, youth, and their families; and supporting culture- and gender-sensitive peace \neducation. The entire output will be financed by the JFPR grant.  \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The ERRM is estimated to cost $439.6 million (Table 4). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier for outputs 2\u20134 are included in the project administration \nmanuals (PAMs).17  \n \n21.  The government has requested two regular loans with an aggregate of $400 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, of which a $300 million loan will finance output 1 and a $100 \nmillion loan will finance output 2. Both loans will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of \n8 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other \n                                                \n17 Project Administration Manuals (Outputs 2, 3, and 4) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  custom-tailored \nrepayment method, the average maturity is 19 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB \nis 0.2% per year. The government has made its own independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility and has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on the \nbasis of any advice from ADB. The financing under the quick-disbursing component will be \nwithdrawn upon loan effectiveness in multiple installments from 2019 based on the withdrawal \napplication accompanied by a certification (para 16). The UCCRTF under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $5 million, to be administered by \nADB to finance output 3, and the JFPR will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $3 million, to \nbe administered by ADB, to finance output 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The DPWH will be the executing \nagency for outputs 2, 3, and 4. Output 2 will be implemented using the existing arrangements for \nADB\u2019s ongoing Improving Growth Corridors in Mindanao Road Sector Project.18 This will entail \nusing the same project management office, supervision and external monitoring arrangements, \nand financial management arrangements. The implementing agency for output 3 will be the LWUA. \nOne firm will be recruited by the LWUA using direct contracting for master planning and civil works, \nwhile individual consultants will be recruited to support the LWUA\u2019s PMU for project design, \nsupervision, and management. The implementing consultant for output 4 will be Save the Children \nPhilippines, a nongovernment organization, which will be recruited by the DPWH using direct \ncontracting. Consultant support will be provided to the DPWH for overseeing the implementation \nof the Outputs 2 to 4. Output 2 will be implemented over a 5-year period, considering the \nexceptional  level  of  reconstruction  required  and  the  complex  local  context  for  project \nimplementation. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 6 and described in \ndetail in the respective PAMs (footnote 17), including justification for direct contracting of the civil \nworks and services under outputs 2, 3, and 4. \n \n25.   Procurement of goods, services, and works will be carried out in a manner consistent with \nthe simplified and expedient procedures permitted under the DEAP and the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Relaxation of open competitive bidding requirements for \nworks and goods with an abbreviated bidding and evaluation period will expedite contract awards \nunder the project (as detailed in the PAMs). For output 2, during project implementation the DPWH \nwill screen, prepare, and appraise the subprojects to be financed under the loan with support from \nthe loan-financed consultants. Discussions will be held with IDPs and local stakeholders to \nconfirm the subprojects, ensure ownership, and maximize benefits. The steering committee will \nreview and select the list of subprojects, based on subproject selection criteria agreed between \nthe DPWH and ADB, and are described in the PAM and in the draft loan agreement. \n \n26.  The ADB Board of Directors is requested to waive the requirement under the DEAP that \nthe quick-disbursing component finances only a list of identified imports necessary for effective \nrecovery assistance. The quick-disbursing component will enable the government to generate \ncounterpart funds in pesos in the equivalent of the loan proceeds, which will be used to directly \nfinance eligible expenditures of the BMCRRP and recurrent expenditures in Lanao del Sur, ARMM \n(para. 16) instead of direct procurement of goods. Disbursement and related arrangements for \nthe quick-disbursing component will follow ADB\u2019s policies and procedures applicable to policy-\nbased lending based on the list of ineligible items19 and ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time).20 \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017.

Since the ERRM is processed as an emergency intervention, financial and economic rates \nhave  not  been  calculated for the  subprojects under  output  2  (footnote  13).  During  ERRM \nimplementation, the design consultants will prepare an economic analysis of the subprojects for \noutput 2 and output 3, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.21 Only \neconomically viable projects will be financed. Most project outputs are non-revenue-generating \npublic services (roads, schools, and health centers) with no cost recovery, and hence no financial \nviability assessment is required for these outputs. In 2017, ADB reviewed the funding available \nfor road maintenance by the DPWH and concluded that it was reasonable to expect that the \ngovernment  will  provide  enough  financing  for  the  maintenance  of  ADB-financed  roads  in \nMindanao (footnote 18). The government has continued in 2018 to quickly increase the DPWH \nallocations for road maintenance and will do so again in 2019. The financial sustainability analysis \nfor all outputs will be completed within 6 months of project implementation. For the water supply \ncomponent,  a  financial  viability  assessment  will  be  conducted  within  6  months  of  project \nimplementation. The government\u2019s commitment to operation and maintenance of all project \nfacilities and assets are included as covenants in loan and grant agreements. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n28.  The government continues to strengthen its public financial management system. The \n2017 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment confirmed that three of the seven \ncore  areas\u2014transparency,  policy-based  budgeting,  and  asset\u2013liability  management\u2014have \nimproved and are now considered strong. Areas of weakness\u2014budget credibility, predictability \nand control in budget execution, and audit\u2014are being actively addressed by the government. \nHowever, given the nature of emergency projects, the financial management risk for the ERRM \nis  high.  The  financial  management  assessments  are  substantially  complete  and  will  be \ncontinuously updated during implementation. The financial management action plan, drafted to \nmitigate  the  risks,  will  be  closely  monitored  during  implementation.  Besides  the  financial \nmanagement arrangements described in para. 16 and footnote 16, the Commission on Audit will \ncarry  out  a  special  audit  focusing  on  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability  at  the \ncompletion of the ERRM. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the DOF. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are in the PAMs (footnote 17). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The ERRM will directly contribute to poverty reduction, inclusive growth, and the social \ndevelopment goals by reconstructing much-needed infrastructure, restoring essential services, \nand reviving livelihood opportunities for thousands of people in the conflict-affected areas of \nMarawi  and  surrounding  municipalities.  The  ERRM  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming at entry. The gender action plan includes proactive measures to ensure (i) equal \nopportunity for men and women in employment and livelihood opportunities; and (ii) gender \nresponsiveness of peace education, psycho-social support, local water supply, sewerage and \ndrainage master plans, and infrastructure. 22 \n \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2017.

The overall ERRM is categorized A for involuntary resettlement because the expected \ncumulative number of affected persons under output 2 exceeds 200, and B for environment and \nindigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The quick-\ndisbursing component under output 1 will not include activities that lead to safeguard implications \nwithin  the  meaning  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS).23 However,  if  the  quick-\ndisbursing support is used for any activity with safeguard impacts, ADB\u2019s SPS requirements will \napply, including the environmental assessment and review frameworks (EARF) and combined \nresettlement and ethnic minority development frameworks (REMDF) prepared for output 2. \n \n31.  Outputs 2 and 3 have safeguard implications, which are covered under two sets of EARF \nand  REMDF  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS.  Frameworks  instead  of  individual \nsafeguard  plans  have  been  prepared  as  the  DEAP  allows  for  procedural  flexibility  in  the \napplication  of  the  safeguard  requirements.  Individual  plans  will  be  prepared  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n32.  Output 2 will have significant safeguard implications for involuntary resettlement and \nnonsignificant  implications  for  indigenous  peoples  and  environment.  Output  2  will  include \nupgrading and reconstruction of existing roads and trails, bridges, other roads, and drainage. \nWorks will be within the existing rights of way. However, land acquisition and resettlement may \nbe  necessary  and  may  generate  significant  impacts.  An  REMDF  has  been  prepared  and \nResettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development  Plans  (REMDP)  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  for  subprojects  consistent  with  the  REMDF.  During  implementation  the \ncategorization will be reassessed and, if impacts under involuntary resettlement are deemed \nnonsignificant, the project will be recategorized; in which case the external monitor for involuntary \nresettlement will still be engaged given that this is a post-conflict environment.24 The proposed \nworks  are  not  anticipated  to  cause  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  during \nconstruction and operation. Environmental assessment reports will be prepared for subprojects \nconsistent with the EARF. \n \n33.   Output 3 has minor safeguard implications. Expected land requirements are limited to \nsmall  parcels  of  land. An  REMDF  has  been  prepared to  address  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguard impacts and a REMDP will be prepared and implemented for subprojects consistent \nwith the REMDF. The project activities are mainly damaged infrastructure in built-up areas of \nMarawi city. Works are not anticipated to be carried out in environmentally sensitive areas, and \nno significant adverse environmental impact is expected during construction and operation. \nEnvironmental assessment reports will be prepared for subprojects consistent with the EARF. \nOutput 4 has no major environment or involuntary resettlement impacts. An indigenous peoples \nplan  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  to  reflect  positive  impacts  on  affected \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The ERRM has three substantial risks.25 Country-level risks include weaknesses in the \npublic financial management system and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the government has \n                                                \n23 Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Frameworks  and  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  People  Planning \nFrameworks for Outputs 2 and 3 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 An external monitor is only required for projects with significant involuntary resettlement impacts. ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009).    \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "13 \nstrengthened the budget review process, reduced the number and size of special purpose funds, \nand  institutionalized  transparency  as  a  precondition  to  accessing  public  funds.  To  reduce \ncorruption risks, the Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cabinet Cluster of the Philippines \nimplemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan (footnote 16). Two \ncontextual risks are (i) recurrence of conflicts (ADB will continue to closely monitor the security \nsituation and coordinate with government agencies), and (ii) lack of coordination in recovery \nefforts. ADB and other DPs will coordinate monitoring with the government through the TFBM. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of ERRM shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAMs and loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the ERRM, which are \nset forth in the loan and grant agreements. \n  \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Emergency \nAssistance for Reconstruction and Recovery of Marawi, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board;  \n(ii)  the loan of $100,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Emergency \nAssistance for Reconstruction and Recovery of Marawi, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(iii)  waiver of the requirement that the quick-disbursing component finance a list of \nidentified  imports  under  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  and \napplication of disbursement arrangements as more fully discussed in para. 26 of \nthis report. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n23 November 2018 \n ", "14  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the ERRM is Aligned with \nSocial and economic recovery in Marawi achieved by 2023 (Bangon Marawi Comprehensive Reconstruction and \nRecovery Program, 2018\u20132022)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2023:     \nAdverse social       \nimpact of the armed  a.
