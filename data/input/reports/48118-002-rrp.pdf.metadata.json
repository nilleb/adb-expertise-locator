Multiple factors play \na  role  in  spreading  communicable  diseases  across  borders,  including  an  increasingly  mobile \npopulation, \ninteraction  between  people  and  animals. \nParticularly at risk are the poor, ethnic groups, and those living in border and remote areas or \nliving along economic corridors.  \n \n4.  \nHealth  systems  weaknesses  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam \n(CLMV)  are  a  threat  to  health  security  in  the  GMS,  one  of  the  targets  of  the  United  Nations \nsustainable  development  goals  for  the  health  sector.5   The  project  will  address  key  binding \nconstraints  in  the  countries\u2019  health  system  and  promote  cross-country  cooperation  aimed  at \nimproving both national and international health security. \n \nCountries  can  take  advantage  of  synergies  from  coordination.  In  recent  years,  health \n5.  \nauthorities  in  GMS  countries  have  made  significant  progress  in  this  arena.  Cross-border \ncollaboration  (which  includes  joint  outbreak  investigation,  information  exchange,  and  patient \nreferrals)  between  neighboring  provinces  across  international  borders  is  gaining  momentum. \nHowever,  these  activities  need  to  be  further  integrated  and  normalized  into  routine  CDC \nactivities. \n \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of \nViet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Regional  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Project.  Manila;  ADB. \n2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grants to the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the \nSecond Greater Mekong Subregion Regional Communicable Diseases Project. Manila. \n\n3   ADB provided a project preparatory technical assistance. \n4   The  cost  of  the  2003  outbreak  of  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  in  terms  of  lost  gross  domestic  product, \n\nmeasured in nominal terms, is estimated at $18 billion for the East Asian and Southeast Asian economies. \n\n5   Health security is achieved through a set of activities, both proactive and reactive, to minimize vulnerability to acute \n\npublic health events that endanger the collective health of national populations. \n\n\f2 \n\nHealth service networks within CLMV have expanded rapidly, but marginalized, mobile, \n6.  \nand  poor  people  still  have  limited  access  to  health  services.  Mobile  populations,  ethnic \nminorities,  and  other  vulnerable  groups  (MEVs)  and  populations  living  in  remote  border  areas \nare  more  susceptible  to  infectious  diseases  and  yet  tend  to  use  health  services  less  than  the \ngeneral population. Cross-border migrant workers returning home with HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis \ninfection have limited access to treatment. Disease control programs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria are in place but often do not reach these vulnerable groups in border areas due to \nstaff and funding constraints. Consequently, in CLMV, up to one-third of tuberculosis cases are \nnot  identified,  and  one-third  of  diagnosed  tuberculosis  and  HIV/AIDS  cases  are  not  properly \ntreated.6 \n \n7.  \nThe  ministries  of  health  (MOHs)  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam \nhave  implemented  surveillance  systems  for  notifiable  diseases  and  syndromic  reporting  to \nimprove reporting of events and identification of cases from the community level.7 However, the \ndisease surveillance system needs further digitalization and extension to all health centers, and \nsyndromic reporting needs to be rolled out nationally. Linkages and integration between disease \nsurveillance,  district  health management  information,  and  zoonotic  disease  surveillance  needs \nto  be  improved.8 Health  authorities  in  CLMV  have  to  increase  their  capacities for  risk  analysis \ndata management, community preparedness, and disease outbreak response. Outbreak district \nresponse  teams  are  often  poorly  equipped  and  financed,  and  need  capacity  building  on \noutbreak investigation and management. \n  \n8.  \nPast investments have improved laboratory services in provincial hospitals. In contrast, \ndistrict  hospital  laboratories  are  unable  to  comply  with  internationally  acceptable  biosafety \nstandards  or  to  guarantee  the  accuracy  of  their  laboratory  tests.  Underlying  problems  include \nsubstandard  training  of  laboratory  staff,  and  insufficient  equipment  and  supplies.  Formal \nprocesses  for  internal  and  external  quality  assurance  are  lacking.  Laboratory  auditing  for \ncompliance with quality and safety guidelines does not exist. \n  \n9.  \nHospitals and health centers are most likely to receive patients with emerging infectious \ndiseases, but IPC practices in health facilities are substandard. Hospital sanitation and hygiene \nfacilities  are  lacking.  Hospital  medical  waste  management  is  often  unsatisfactory.  The general \npublic has almost unrestricted access to infectious patients\u2019 wards. Such practices may result in \nineffective treatment, the  spread of  infectious  diseases,  increased  hospital-acquired  infections, \nand development of drug resistance. \n \nThe  governments  have  demonstrated  strong  commitment  and  leadership  towards  the \n10.  \ncontrol  of  emerging  infectious  diseases  and  other  diseases  of  regional  importance.  National \npolicies and plans are in place to deal with these major health threats. CLMV have stepped up \ndomestic financing and mobilization of external assistance to improve cross-border cooperation. \nCLMV are committed to achieve standards based on the International Health Regulations, 2005, \nin  line  with  the  strategic  framework  of  the  Asia  Pacific  Strategy  for  Emerging  Diseases \n(APSED),  2010,  both  of  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO). 9 The  APSED,  2010  includes \neight  focus  areas:  (i)  regional  preparedness,  alert,  and  response;  (ii)  surveillance,  risk \n\n                                                \n6   ADB.  2016.

Other development partners that play an important role in CDC include the United States \nAgency for International Development,  which is  rolling  out the Global  Health Security  Agenda; \nthe  Global  Fund  to  Fight  HIV/AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria;  the  Three  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal Fund in Myanmar; WHO for CDC technical support;  the Global Alliance for \n\nLessons  learned  from  previous  and  current  interventions  include  the  following:              \n\n                                                \n10  ADB. 2014.

The project will complement these \nexisting interventions by (i) addressing gaps in laboratory diagnostic capacity in hospital IPC in \nremote area, (ii) strengthening the health system generally rather than concentrating on disease \nspecific  interventions,  and  (iii)  fostering  regional  cooperation  for  public  goods.  Further,  as \nCLMV\u2019s  national  income  per  capita  increases,  future  financing  by  the  Global  Fund  to  Fight \nHIV/AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria,  and  bilateral  development  partners  is  uncertain  and \nADB\u2019s support seeks to fill this impending gap.  \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe impact will be GMS public health security strengthened. The outcome will be GMS \nhealth  system  performance  with  regard  to  health  security  improved.  The  project  locations  are \nselected  provinces  along  borders  and  economic  corridors.  In  these  locations,  health  facilities \ntypically  serve  the  local  population  as  well  as  mobile  and  migrant  populations.  The  selection \ncriteria for project provinces, states, and regions are (i) high poverty incidence; (ii) high burden \nof  communicable  disease;  (iii)  high  regional  risk  of  disease  outbreaks;  and  (v)  limited  support \nfrom other development partners. The project will cover 13 provinces in Cambodia, 12 provinces \nin the Lao PDR, five states and regions in Myanmar, and 36 provinces in Viet Nam.17 \n \nC. \n \n15. \n \n\nThe project will have three outputs:  \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Regional  cooperation  and  communicable  disease  control  in \nborder  areas  improved.  This  output  will  strengthen  APSED  focus  areas  1,  3, \nand 4 (para. 10). Under this output, the project will strengthen (i) regional, cross-\nborder, and intersectoral information sharing and coordination of outbreak control \namong  GMS  countries;  (ii)  regional  capacity  for  evidence-based  CDC;  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  better  disease control  strategies for  MEVs  in border  areas;  and \n(iv)  improved  CDC  services  for  MEVs  in  hotspots  along  economic  corridors  in \ntargeted border areas. The project will provide technical expertise and funding, to \nimprove information exchange between CLMV countries and foster intersectoral \ncollaboration. The project will finance cross-border activities (including simulation \nexercises,  and  joint  outbreak  investigation  and  control),  and  outreach  activities \ntargeting  MEVs.  The  regional  coordination  unit,  hosted  by  the  MOH  of  the  Lao \nPDR  and  financed  under  a  regional  technical  assistance  project,  will  provide \ntechnical  support  to  CLMV  for  information  exchange,  disease  control  strategies \nfor MEVs, and organization of regional events.18 \n\n                                                \n17 Project provinces in Cambodia: Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampot, Kandal, Kratie, Mondulkiri, Pailin, Preah \nVihear, Prey Veng, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Svay Rieng, and  Tbong Khmum.

The  project  provides  for  capacity  building  and  support  in  these \nareas.  WHO  will  provide  technical  support  and  training  for  disease  control  strategies,  quality \ncontrol of laboratories, and improvement of IPC in hospitals. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nThe  economic  rationale  for  investing  in  the  project  lies  in  the  nature  of  health  security \nbeing  a  regional  public  good.  CDC  interventions  including  public  education,  epidemiological \nsurveillance,  cross-border  vector  control,  and  regional  cooperation  positively  impact  labor \nproductivity  and  directly  reduce  the  burden  of  disease  for  individuals  and  households.  The \neconomic internal rate of return on the project investment is estimated to be 21.8% over a 10-\nyear benefit stream for CLMV combined. The economic benefits accrue from (i) a narrowing of \nthe health status and disease incidence gaps between target areas and the rest of country, (ii) \naversion  or  mitigation  of  epidemic  outbreaks  as  a  percentage  of  national  gross  domestic \nproduct,  and  (iii)  effective  lab  testing  and  subsequent  treatment  of  particular  communicable \ndiseases  (e.g.,  dengue).  Recurrent  costs  are  assumed  not  to  decline  in  the  5  years  following \nproject  implementation  but  represent  less  than  0.27%  of  projected  annual  government  health \nexpenditure in CLMV. Given this small percentage and the headroom for expanding government \nhealth  expenditure,  the  project  is  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable  in  all  four \ncountries. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n25. \nFiduciary  risk  in  the  health  sector  of  the  four  countries  has  been  assessed  as  high  in \nMyanmar,  substantial  in  Cambodia,  and  moderate  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam.  The \nprocurement risk assessment is considered high in the Lao PDR and Myanmar, and moderate \nin  Viet  Nam  and  Cambodia.  The  MOHs  in  CLMV  lack  the  necessary  human  resources  for \nprocurement  and financial  management.  However  the  MOHs  of  Cambodia,  the  Lao PDR,  and \nViet  Nam  have gained  substantial  experience  in  implementing  ADB-assisted  projects  over  the \nyears and have staff trained in ADB procedures. Myanmar MOH has limited experience in ADB \nstandards for financial management  and procurement, so the  staff  will  receive  training  in ADB \nprocedures. The CLMV governments have given assurances that capable government staff will \nbe appointed in a timely manner. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \ndiscussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare in the project administration manual (footnote 20). \n \nD. \n \n26. \n Neglected  communicable  diseases,  along  with  HIV/AIDS,  tuberculosis,  and  malaria \ncontribute  as  a group  to  the  top  ten  factors  of  burden  of  disease.21 The  poor  especially  suffer \n                                                \n21 World Health Organization. 2010.

The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  primarily  by  preventing  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases and  major  epidemics, \nand improving access to diagnostics and treatment, thus reducing medical expenses, morbidity, \nmortality, and related household impact. \n \n27. \n Multiple  factors  limit  women\u2019s  access  to  and  affordability  of  health  services,  including \ncultural  perceptions,  travel  distance,  potential  safety  risks,  and  financial  resources.  Health \nservices  do  not  sufficiently  consider  the  specific  needs  of  women.  The  current  surveillance \nsystem does not include the reporting of sex-disaggregated data. The project is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming as it will directly improve women\u2019s access to health services. To \nensure the effectiveness of gender mainstreaming and gender-related outcomes in the project, \nMOHs  in  CLMV  will  implement  the  gender  action  plan.22 The  gender  mainstreaming  actions \ninclude  (i)  strengthening national sex-disaggregated surveillance systems; (ii)  conducting  CDC \noutreach activities targeting women and girls with gender-sensitive materials; and (iii) ensuring \nparticipation of female health staff in training, and in regional workshops.. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  indigenous  peoples.  Ethnic  minorities  in  the \nproject  areas  will  be  positively  affected  as  they  will  have  better  access  to  improved  health \nservices.  An  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  has  been  prepared  for  each  country,  and \nincludes  measures  to  ensure  ethnic  minority  groups  benefit  from  the  project.  The  project  is \nclassified as category C for involuntary resettlement. There will be no construction of new health \nfacilities or extension of existing health facilities, and no land acquisition is required. Screening \nduring  the  selection  of  health  facilities  to  be  refurbished  will  rule  out  proposed  sites,  which \nrequire land acquisition and have resettlement impacts. The project is classified as category B \nfor environment, as the project has components dealing with laboratory biohazards and hospital \nsolid  and  liquid  waste  management.  Mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  to  address  minor  environmental  risks.  An  initial  environmental  examination \nand an environmental assessment and review framework have been prepared. \n \nF. \n \n29. \nThe  risk  for  the  project  is  assessed  as  medium  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet \nNam, and high in Myanmar. Major risks include (i) insufficient administrative capacity for project-\nrelated financial management and procurement; (ii) complexity of financial management  linked \nto  the  large  number  of  implementing  agencies;  and  (iii)  limited  health  human  resources  for \nlaboratory improvements and IPC activities. Mitigation measures include (i) involving provinces, \nregions, and states in the preparation of annual operation plans; (ii) hiring consultants for initial \ntechnical  and  administrative  assistance  and  producing  financial  management  manuals;  (iii) \ntraining  project  staff;  and  (iv)  conducting  all  procurement  activities  at  the  central  government \nlevel. In addition, the MOH of Myanmar will be assisted with up-front financial management and \nprocurement  consultants  and  training  by  ADB.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the risks of the project. Major risks and mitigating measures are described \nin detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan. 23  \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n   \n30. \nThe governments and the MOHs of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam \nhave  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB \npolicies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, \nconsulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual  and  loan  documents.
