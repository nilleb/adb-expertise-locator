THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $40,000,000 (or its yuan equivalent) to Zhujiang Financial Leasing Company Limited (ZFL) \nfor the Zhujiang Financial Leasing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance Project in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing longer-tenor financing \nto ZFL for lease finance to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the PRC. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing will support ZFL\u2019s funding requirements for long-term funding for SMEs, which is in short \nsupply.  ADB\u2019s  support  will  enable  the  company  to  provide  longer-tenor  lease  finance  to \nunderserved segments, improve its asset\u2013liability profile, and diversify its funding sources. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Overview of access to finance by small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs are an \nimportant part of the PRC economy. The development of SMEs directly contributes to economic \ngrowth, given their critical role in creating jobs. Small businesses with 300 or fewer employees \naccounted for 98.64% of all firms and contributed more than 60% of total gross domestic product \n(GDP), 50% of tax income, 75% of job creation, and 68% of exports.1  Despite the significant \ncontribution of SMEs to economic growth, limited access to finance has always been a major \nconstraint on SMEs. Banks have shown a preference for lending to state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) and larger corporates operating in the priority sectors identified in domestic industrial \npolicy, as SMEs are considered a higher-risk segment with higher transaction costs. Since 2011, \nthe  Government  of  the  PRC  has  implemented  various  initiatives  to  improve  the  business \nenvironment for SMEs and facilitate their access to finance, including amending the Law on \nPromoting Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and developing small banks and non-deposit-\ntaking financial institutions. Despite government initiatives, many SMEs are still marginalized in \naccess to financing. The financing gap for micro and SMEs in the PRC reached $1.89 trillion in \n2017, accounting for 17% of GDP.2 \n \n4.  Financial leasing industry. Leasing is particularly suited for SME financing, especially to \npurchase equipment, which is not generally accepted as collateral by commercial banks. The \nPRC\u2019s leasing industry grew rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of 24.85% in 2008\u20132019, \nfilling the gap that traditional banks do not bridge. Despite rapid growth, the financial leasing \nindustry needs further development. The lease penetration rate was 1.71% in 2019, ranking it \n24th out of the top 50 global leasing markets.3 \n \n5.  Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small and medium-sized enterprises. The \noutbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 has adversely impacted SMEs \nin the PRC. They are vulnerable to shocks because of their financial weakness, lower degree of \nbusiness diversification, smaller size, and lower ability to withstand temporary disruption in \nproduction and services. SMEs are generally not as digitalized as other firms, making them less \nresilient and flexible in adapting to changes in work processes to respond to the business \n \n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2020. Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs 2020. Paris. \n2  SME Finance Forum. Formal MSME Finance Gap (accessed on 26 March 2021). \n3  White Clarke Group. 2021. Global Leasing Report 2021. London. Lease penetration rate is measured as a \npercentage of lease finance to total GDP. \n ", "2 \nenvironment during the pandemic. The government has introduced policy measures to support \nSMEs,  including  raising  central  bank  relending  and  rediscounting  quotas,  and  directionally \nlowering the deposit reserve ratio of the People\u2019s Bank of China to encourage banks to lend more \nto SMEs at lower interest rates. Despite this policy support, SMEs continue to face difficulty in \naccessing finance. As of June 2020, credit to SMEs accounted for only 28.86% of total bank \nloans.4 \n \n6.  Rationale. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations projects in the PRC\u2019s finance sector have \nactively supported leasing, targeting diverse subsectors in underdeveloped segments, including \nSME financing.5 In 2018, ADB disbursed a $60 million loan (in CNY equivalent) to ZFL for SME \nfinance in the underdeveloped central and western regions of the PRC,6 and the loan proceeds \nhave been successfully deployed. The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed significant challenges \nfor SME development, reducing jobs, especially for migrant workers from rural areas, who \ntypically work in services and light manufacturing. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n7.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. Guangdong\u2019s Pearl River Delta area alone \nhad 44.2 million migrant workers in 2019 or 25% of all migrant workers in the PRC.7 Almost all \nmigrant workers are employed by SMEs, which accounted for 98.4% of total enterprises in \nGuangdong. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted SMEs and jobs for migrant \nworkers; 8 million migrant workers are estimated to have lost their urban jobs on a long-term basis \nand resettled in their native regions because of the COVID-19 outbreak.8 SMEs in Guangdong \nface significant challenges in accessing finance. Loans to all private enterprises in Guangdong \naccounted for 28.0% of the total outstanding banking sector loans in that province by the third \nquarter of 2020, while loans to SMEs accounted for only 10.4%.9 Lack of collateral is a key \nconstraint on SMEs\u2019 access to finance, and unsecured loans to SMEs accounted for only 9.1% of \ntotal SME loans and 0.95% of total banking sector loans in Guangdong. The province has \nsubstantial regional disparity in economic development and significant income inequality. In 2019, \nthe total GDP of Guangzhou and Shenzhen cities accounted for 46.9% of total GDP of the entire \nprovince.10 Of the 21 cities in Guangdong, 14 had a per capita GDP that was below the national \naverage of CNY71,965 ($10,300). Shenzhen, the most developed city, had a GDP per capita that \nwas 10 times more than that of Meizhou ($29,627 versus $2,963). This project will help expand \nZFL\u2019s capacity to finance SMEs, particularly those outside the most developed cities\u2014Beijing, \nGuangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen\u2014increasing jobs and reducing regional income inequality. \n \nB.

ZFL was established in December 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Guangzhou \nRural Commercial Bank (GRCB) and is a leasing company regulated by the China Banking \nInsurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n9.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \nOwnership. ZFL is a wholly owned subsidiary of GRCB. Excluding the big 5 state-owned banks and the \n12 national joint-stock commercial banks, GRCB is one of the larger local banks and ranked fourth among \nall rural commercial banks by total assets in 2019. By June 2020, GRCB had total assets of CNY972 billion \nand total deposits of CNY727 billion. GRCB is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s and has been listed on the Hong \nKong Stock Exchange since 2017 with market capitalization of HK$6 billion as of 19 March 2021. GRCB \nhas  a  diversified  shareholder  structure.  Its  largest  beneficial  owner  is  the  Guangzhou  municipal \ngovernment, with a total shareholding of 18.22% through 13 SOEs. The remaining shareholders are mainly \nprivate sector entities and individual investors. No other shareholders directly or indirectly hold more than \na 5% stake in GRCB. ADB conducted integrity due diligence on ZFL and its shareholders, board of directors, \nand key managers.11 Although ZFL\u2019s beneficial owners could not all be identified, the potential risk is \nmitigated by the fact that GRCB\u2019s relevant shares are held by public and institutional investors, and no \nshareholder other than the government holds more than a 5% indirect stake in GRCB. ADB\u2019s review does \nnot give ADB cause to believe that the entity is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. Tax \nintegrity due diligence was not required because the transaction does not involve intermediate jurisdictions \nor material related-party transactions.12 \n \n11.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.   \n \n12.  Governance structure. ZFL has a well-defined corporate governance structure. The \nboard of directors is responsible for overall strategy, major decisions, key business objectives, \nand senior management appointments. Since ZFL is a fully owned subsidiary of GRCB, all \ndirectors are appointed by GRCB. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED.

The \nproject will use the government\u2019s definition of SMEs.13 For lease finance to SMEs, the maximum \namount funded by the proposed loan will be capped at $8 million per sub-project. The proposed \nloan is also expected to fund the pilot of a new lease finance product for micro-enterprises that \nZFL plans to launch in late 2021. \n \n15.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project over its life. ZFL will provide ADB \nwith financial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, including \n(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial statements, (iii) quarterly \ncompliance certificates for financial covenants, (iv) periodic reports on the underlying leases \nfinanced by ZFL through the loan, and (v) annual reports on the selected development indicators \nand the safeguards and social dimensions policy agreed between ADB and ZFL. \n \n16.  Evaluation. ADB will prepare monitoring reports regularly and at least annually. The first \nreport will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first loan disbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n17.  Provide  long-term  stable  finance.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION  DELETED.  To \ndiversify its funding sources, ZFL issued one bond, through which it raised CNY1 billion in April \n2019. However, a bond issuance is subject to long regulatory approval, and the company will not \nbe able to tap the capital markets again without fresh approval from regulators. The long-tenor \nfunding from ADB will enable the company to provide longer-tenor leasing products for SMEs and \nimprove its asset\u2013liability profile, increasing the company\u2019s capacity to expand its operations. \n \n18.  Support  development of innovative  financing  modality  for  SMEs and  facilitate \nknowledge transfer. Leasing is a modality particularly suited to finance SMEs, especially for \nprocurement of manufacturing equipment, which is not generally accepted as collateral by \ncommercial banks. By supporting a leasing company with a strong SME focus, the proposed loan \nwill help expand SMEs\u2019 access to lease finance and, in turn, support job creation and economic \ngrowth.  The  project  will  support  ZFL to  pilot  a  new  lease  finance  product targeting micro \nenterprises, and ADB will also facilitate knowledge transfer and information exchange between \nZFL and leasing companies operating in other ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n \n19.  Support gender equity. ADB will work with ZFL to promote gender-inclusive measures \nin operations. ZFL will create a respectful working environment by introducing anti\u2013sexual-\nharassment  measures  and  creating  opportunities  for  women  by  hiring  female  interns  and \nproviding professional development training for female staff members. \n \n20.  Mobilize  cofinancing  and  supporting  safeguards  capacity  development.  ADB \nexpects to mobilize additional cofinancing for the project and has been arranging a $40 million \nparallel loan from Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (DEG). Cofinancing \n \n13 In  2011,  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Information  Technology  and  National  Bureau  of  Statistics,   National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and Ministry of Finance promulgated The Notice on Issuing the Provisions \non Criteria for Classifying Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, which is used by the China Banking Regulatory \nCommission to measure and monitor SME-financing performance of financial institutions. SMEs are defined and \ncategorized into three types (i.e. medium, small and micro enterprises) based on revenues, staff size, and/or total \nassets, depending on the characteristics of different industries. For instance, in agriculture, enterprises with annual \nrevenues of CNY5 million\u2013CNY200 million are defined as medium-sized enterprises; CNY500,000\u2013CNY5 million, \nsmall enterprises; and less than CNY500,000, microenterprises. The definition applies to all legal forms of enterprise, \nincluding individually owned businesses. \n ", "5 \nwill help diversify the funding base of ZFL and further improve its access to long-term finance. \nADB also plans to work with DEG to develop an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) training package tailored for the specific needs of ZFL. \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n21.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) access to lease finance for \nSMEs  through  financial  leasing  improved,14 and  (ii)  financial  leasing  industry  developed.15  \nDespite their importance in job creation and output generation, SMEs still face significant barriers \nto accessing credit from financial institutions. The project will promote SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand contribute to economic growth. By providing longer-tenor finance to a small leasing company, \nthe project will support the development of the financial leasing industry in the PRC, where the \nleasing penetration rate was only 1.71% in 2019, lower than in major developed markets. The \nproject extends ADB\u2019s support to the leasing industry beyond the top-tier leasing companies \ntypically financed by ADB. \n \n22.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: sustainability of ZFL\u2019s SME leasing \noperations improved. \n \n23.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) ZFL\u2019s capacity to extend lease \nfinancing to SMEs increased, (ii) skills development opportunities for ZFL\u2019s female staff members \nimproved, and (iii) gender inclusiveness of ZFL\u2019s work environment increased. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n24.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project supports ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities 1 (tackling remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) and \n2 (accelerating progress in gender equality).16 The project aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nOperational Plan for Priority 2 Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality, 2019\u20132024.17 The \nproject is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025 for the PRC, which \nemphasizes expediting access to financing for private companies, particularly SMEs.18  \n \n25.  Consistency with the sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is \naligned with the Review of ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational Plan, which notes that ADB will \nsupport financial inclusion of the traditionally underserved, such as SMEs.19 The plan calls for \nincreased support to leasing and other finance subsectors, which supplement commercial banks \nand play an important role in improving SMEs\u2019 access to finance.

The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department\u2019s strategy for COVID-19 response by supporting businesses, including \nSMEs negatively affected by the pandemic. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  ADB has categorized the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009).21 \n \n27.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the potential environmental and social (E&S) risks \nassociated with ZFL\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for E&S \nmanagement. ZFL is an existing ADB client, and it has established and maintained an ESMS \nsatisfactory to ADB that includes procedures to (i) screen transactions against ADB's prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list,  (ii)  categorize  investments  to  exclude  those  having  significant \nenvironmental and/or social impacts (category A), and (iii) ensure that investments using ADB \nloan proceeds comply with applicable ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements \nand national laws and regulations. ZFL\u2019s Environmental and Social Responsibility Committee, \nheaded by senior management, is responsible for the establishment of the ESMS and its \nintegration into company processes, and oversees the implementation of the ESMS risk mitigation \nmeasures  by  business  development  managers  in  the  processing  and  monitoring  of  lease \ncontracts. \n \n28.  During due diligence, ADB reviewed the E&S annual monitoring reports, which include \nsubprojects financed using proceeds from an earlier ADB loan. The review confirmed that ZFL \nhas  developed  an  ESMS  implementation  guide,  provided  ESMS  training  to  relevant  staff \nmembers  to  support  ESMS  implementation,  and  implemented  the  ESMS  screening  and \ncategorization procedures in the subprojects previously financed by ADB. Through its company \nwebsite, ZFL provides avenues to raise concerns and grievances related to its operations. The \ncompany monitors reputational risks throughout its portfolio by engaging an external data service \nprovider to regularly check on legal disputes involving its clients, including any labor-related \ncases. The lease portfolio of ZFL involving SMEs is not expected to have significant adverse \nenvironmental or social impacts, given that most of the leases are for equipment or facilities. \nNevertheless, the capacity of the in-house team to identify environmental, health and safety, and \nsocial risks can be further strengthened by providing additional ESMS training. ZFL has indicated \nthat it would welcome additional support and, as such, ADB plans to work with the other \ndevelopment finance institution cofinancier to develop an ESMS training package tailored for the \ncompany\u2019s specific needs. \n \n29.  ZFL will continue to include the following information in the annual monitoring reports it \nsubmits to ADB: (i) the nature of subprojects and categorizations, (ii) compliance with safeguard \nand social requirements, and (iii) compliance with applicable national and international laws and \nstandards. ZFL will continue to ensure compliance with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), take measures to comply with the internationally recognized \n \n20 ADB. 2004.
