Supreme  Energy  Muara  Laboh (SEML) for the  Muara Laboh  Geothermal \nPower Project in Indonesia. The report also describes the (i) proposed administration of a loan \nof  up  to  $20  million,  to be  provided  by  the  Leading  Asia\u2019s  Private  Sector  Infrastructure  Fund 1 \n(LEAP); and (ii) proposed administration of a loan of up to $19.25 million, to be provided by the \nClean  Technology  Fund  (CTF).2 If  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP and CTF loans. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\nGrowing  demand  for  clean  power  generation.  In  2014,  Indonesia  was  the  largest \n2. \nSoutheast  Asian  economy,  with  its  gross  domestic  product  estimated  at  $888.5  billion.  The \neconomy  experienced  consistent  growth  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  averaging  around  5% \nper  year.  Power  infrastructure,  however,  is  struggling  to  keep  up  with  the  strong  economic \nperformance:  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MEMR)  estimates  that  power \ndemand will increase by 8.5% per annum under the current economic forecasts, resulting in a \nshortage of about 35 gigawatts (GW) before 2020, which could undermine the country\u2019s growth \npotential. \n \n3. \nTo cope with the predicted electricity shortages over the medium term, the Government \nof  Indonesia  introduced  various  fast-track  programs  to  accelerate  the  development  of  power \ngeneration. While the largest share of generation is still expected to rely on fossil fuels such as \ncoal and gas, the government is encouraging the greening of the generation mix; its goal is to \nboost the share of energy supplied from renewable energy from 12% in 2013 to 23% in 2025.3 \nThis goal will help meet Indonesia\u2019s commitment to curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 29% \nby 2030 and promote a more sustainable path for economic growth.4 \n \n4. \nIndonesia  is  endowed  with  several  renewable  energy  resources,  including  wind,  solar, \ngeothermal,  and  biomass.  Geothermal  power  offers  some  unique  benefits  to  support \nsustainability in Indonesia. First, geothermal power comes from thermal energy that is naturally \ngenerated  in  the  earth  and  most  accessible  and  abundant  near  tectonic  plate  boundaries.5 \nThanks  to  its  location  at  the  edge  of  the  Pacific  plate,  Indonesia  is  estimated  to  have  over \n29,000 megawatts (MW)  of geothermal  resources  (equivalent  to  40%  of the global resource).6 \nSecond,  geothermal  power  plants  are  generally  reliable  and  demonstrate  high  availability  and \ncapacity factors. Thus, at scale, they can contribute a sizable portion to baseload power needs \nwhile leaving a much smaller carbon footprint than an equivalent fossil-fuel-based capacity. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2   Financed by the ADB\u2019s Clean Technology Fund. http://www.climateinvestmentfund.org. \n3  ADB. 2015.

Indonesia  has  an  identified \n5. \ngeothermal project pipeline of 3,200 MW, which accounts for 24% of the capacity of geothermal \nprojects  planned  globally. 7  In  2016,  only  1.3  GW  or  5%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  geothermal \npotential  was  developed.8 Indonesian  geothermal  regulation  has  substantially  improved  since \n2003  but  translating  the  immense  geothermal  opportunity  into  reality  is  challenging,  mainly \nbecause of the risks of proving and managing the geothermal resource. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n6. \nThe  project  will  develop  geothermal  steam  resources  through  production  and  injection \nfacilities  in  the  Liki  Pinangawan  Muara  Laboh  concession  area  and  construct,  operate,  and \nmaintain  a  single  power  generation  unit  with  a  capacity  of  about  80  MW.  The  concession  is \nlocated in the South Solok Regency, 150 kilometers (km) southeast of Padang in the province of \nWest Sumatra. The project will be developed and implemented under a 30-year PPA with PLN. \nIt is intended for baseload operation. PLN will build 80 km of transmission lines from the plant \nsite to two 150-kilovolt substations near Muara Laboh and Sungai Rumbai. The substations will \nconnect  power  from  the  generation  unit  to  the  Sumatra  grid  through  an  existing  275-kilovolt \ntransmission line. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nThe project had been prioritized under PLN\u2019s electricity supply business plan9 and is also \n7. \npart  of  the  third  accelerated  development  program  launched  by  the  government  in  2015.  The \nproject  benefits  from  20-year  support  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  as  stipulated  under  a \nbusiness viability guarantee letter. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and Sponsors \n\n8. \nThe borrower will be SEML, an Indonesian project company owned by three sponsors: \nEngie  (previously  GDF  Suez,  rated  A  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  [S&P]  and  A2  by  Moody\u2019s); \nSumitomo  Corporation  (rated  A-  by  S&P  and  Baa1  by  Moody\u2019s);  and  PT.  Supreme  Energy10 \n(not  rated).  The  respective  shareholding  percentages  are  35%,  35%,  and  30%.    The  project \nbenefits from  strong  contractual  arrangements  with  creditworthy,  investment-grade  parties: the \ngovernment, rated BB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody\u2019s; and PLN, rated BB by S&P and Baa3 by \nMoody\u2019s.  The  sponsors  bring  a  valuable  combination  of  technical  skills,  geothermal  expertise, \nand  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  development  experience  to  the  power  sector  in \nIndonesia. \n \n\n                                                 \n7  Bloomberg  New  Energy  Finance.  2013.

The latest electricity supply business plan \ncovers the years 2016\u20132025. \n\n10 Supreme Energy was established in 2007 to develop three geothermal concessions on the island of Sumatra. One \nof the founders and majority owner, Supramu Santosa, is a pioneer of geothermal development in Indonesia. He \nwas the founder of Star Energy, the owner of Wayang Windu, a 117MW geothermal power development operating \nin West  Java  since  1999.  PT  Supreme  Energy  is  also  one  of  the  sponsors  of  Rantau  Dedap  geothermal  power \nproject that ADB supported through a CTF loan for explorations. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nis  exercised \n\nEngie\u2019s  ownership \n\nintermediate \n9. \njurisdictions.11 A  review  of  the  entities  does  not  give  ADB  cause  to  believe  that  such  entities \nhave been established, or are being used for cross-border tax evasion,12 money laundering, or \nterrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n\nthrough  entities  established \n\nin \n\nIndonesia\u2019s  2016\u20132025  medium-term  power  development  plan, \n\n10. \nImpacts.  Through  the  development  and  commissioning  of  an  80  MW  baseload \ngeothermal power plant and avoidance of carbon emissions, ADB\u2019s financing support will assist \nthe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  sustainable  growth  targets  through  private  sector \ninvestment.  The  government  aims  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the  country\u2019s \nprimary  energy  supply  from  12%  in  2013  to  23%  by  2025.  Further,  Indonesia  recently \nstrengthened its climate commitment by submitting the following intended, nationally determined \ncontribution  to  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  in  2015:  an  unconditional \nemission  reduction  of  29%  by  2030  relative  to  business  as  usual  based  solely  on  domestic \nsupport, with a further reduction of up to 41% if adequate international support is given (para. 3). \ninto \nIn \ngeothermal  accounting  for  over  1.3  GW  of  new  power  by  2019  and  over  6.1  GW  by  2025, \nmostly delivered through IPPs. \n \nOutcome.  The  outcome  will  be  that  geothermal  power  generation  in  West  Sumatra  is \n11. \nexpanded  by  80  MW.  The  project  will  demonstrate  the  commercial  viability  of  large-scale  IPP \ngeothermal projects. By developing new geothermal baseload power generation in the island of \nSumatra,  the  project  will  help  displace  fossil-fuel-generated  power,  which  is  the  dominant \nalternative  in  Sumatra\u2019s  grid.  The  construction  and  operation  of  the  power  plant  will  generate \nemployment  for  the  local  community  and  support  climate  change  mitigation  through  an \nestimated net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to 471,240 tons per year. \n \n12. \ngeneration unit with a total capacity of about 80 MW. \n \nC. \n\nOutput.  The  output  will  be  one  constructed  and  commissioned  geothermal  power \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\ntranslates \n\nthis \n\n13. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020 13  by  promoting  environmentally  sustainable  growth  and \nprivate  sector  development  through  the  expansion  of  geothermal  baseload  power  generation. \nThe project will displace and offset greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions generated by \ncoal-fired  or  diesel-fired  power  stations.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  the  interim  country \npartnership  strategy  2015 14 for  Indonesia  by  supporting  the  expansion  of  infrastructure  and \nenvironment-friendly technologies for clean energy generation and energy efficiency. \n \n14. \nConsistency  with  energy  sector  strategy  and  ADB  operations.  The  project \ncontributes  to  the  objectives  of  Indonesia\u2019s  National  Energy  Policy  (2014)  and  to  the \n\n                                                 \n11 \u201cIntermediate  jurisdiction\u201d  is  defined  in  the  Integrity  Due  Diligence  Guidelines  (revised  December  2015).

While  more  geothermal  projects  are  reaching  an  exploration  stage  that  makes  them \nready for financing, exploration costs and the risk associated with the development of the steam \nresource remain high. The availability of concessional finance motivates developers to complete \nmore  challenging  exploration  programs  and  reach  financial  close.  Following  the  Sarulla  and \nRantau  Dedap  projects,  this  is  the  third  project  in  Indonesia  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  $150  million \nCTF geothermal program for 2013.18 The development of the Muara Laboh project shows that \nconcessional financing is still needed to partially offset the elevated costs associated with early-\nmover  risks  faced  by  the  private  sector.  The  project  is  also  showing  that,  thanks  to  the  CTF \nsupport, the market is moving toward a more solid financial viability that will allow future projects \nto be developed with less concessional resources. \n \n18. \nSEML will be the first geothermal IPP to conclude resource exploration and advance to \nsteam-field  and  power  plant  development  since  the  Sarulla  project  in  2014.  While  the  Sarulla \nproject was part of a previous generation of geothermal projects operating under the old mining \nregime,  SEML  is  leading  the  next  generation  of  geothermal  projects  classified  as  nonmining \nactivities. Given ADB\u2019s experience in leading the financing of geothermal projects in Indonesia, \nADB is in a unique position to translate wide-ranging lessons about resource risk management \ninto  commercially  viable  solutions  (more  resilient  and  implementable  financing  structures)  for \nthe next generation of geothermal projects and IPPs.  ADB\u2019s financing will help demonstrate (i) \nthe  bankability  of  the  new  geothermal  PPA  jointly  developed  by  PLN  and  the  sponsors,  upon \nwhich  subsequent  geothermal  IPP  PPAs  are  likely  to  be  based;  (ii)  the  continued  investor \ninterest  to  finance  geothermal  power  in  Indonesia;  and  (iii)  the  replicability  of  structuring \nsolutions designed for the financing of the Sarulla project to manage complexities and resource \nrisks presented by geothermal IPPs. \n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\n19. \nResource  risk.

Although  forecasts  of  geothermal  reservoir  and  well-field  performance \nare inherently uncertain, the cash flow of the project is sufficiently robust to absorb a worst-case \nscenario, including the resource degradation downside scenario recommended by the lenders\u2019 \nresource consultant. GeothermEx opines that the potential risk of a resource shortfall is low over \n\n                                                 \n18 https://www-cif.climateinvestmentfunds.org/projects/private-sector-geothermal-energy-program \n\n\f 6\n\nthe  30-year  concession  period  and  can  be  mitigated  by  a  planned  make-up  well  drilling \nprogram.  Residual risk from reservoir performance and resource management is underpinned \nby  contingency  budgets,  management  expertise  and  sponsors\u2019  financial  flexibility  and \ncommitment. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED]  \n \n20. \nDrilling risk. As with any project involving drilling, the risk of delays or cost overruns due \nto  issues  such  as  unproductive  wells  and  lower-than-expected  well  capacities  is  high.  The \nunderground soil conditions, which affect the ease at which a well can be drilled, may only be \nknown with precision once the well is actually being drilled. This will partly be mitigated by the \ndrilling program\u2019s in-built flexibility, and by including sufficient drilling contingency budget in the \nproject  cost.  The  drilling  budget  was  vetted  by  the  lenders\u2019  technical  consultant  and  deemed \nadequate. \n \n21. \nConstruction  and  technology  risk.  The  construction  risk  of  the  power  plant  is \nmoderate  given  the  plant\u2019s  limited  size  (80  MW).  A  significant  portion  of  this  risk  will  be \ntransferred to contractors through a fixed-price, date-certain, turnkey engineering, procurement, \nand  construction  contract  with  Sumitomo  Corporation.  The  use  of  dual  flash  technology  is  not \ncurrently common in Indonesia but deemed relatively proven in other countries with similar-size \nprojects. Prudent design and operation will be assured by the borrower\u2019s technical team and its \nadvisors, and will be monitored by the lenders\u2019 technical advisor. \n \n22. \nOfftaker  counterparty  risk. All electricity generated by the project will be sold to PLN, \nIndonesia\u2019s state-owned electricity utility, through a fixed USD denominated tariff for the term of \nthe  PPA.  PLN  owns  and  operates  most  of  the  country's  generating  capacity  and  is  the  main \nprovider  of  power  transmission  and  distribution  services  in  Indonesia. 19  It  has  a  dominant \nintegrated  position  in  the  sector  and  a  strong  track  record  of  support  from  the  government, \nwhose sovereign ratings are BB+ from S&P and Baa3 from Moody\u2019s. Offtake risk is significantly \nmitigated by the 20-year business viability guarantee letter by the Ministry of Finance to ensure \nPLN\u2019s capacity to fulfill its payment obligations under the project contracts.  \n \n23. \nOperation and maintenance risk and availability risk. Under the take-or-pay PPA, the \nplant\u2019s  compensation  is  linked  to  its  availability  to  produce  electricity.  The  operation  and \nmaintenance  plan  is  also  conservatively  accounting  for  costs  that  may  arise  because  of  a \ngeothermal  fluid\u2019s  composition  that  deviates  from  the  current  projections.  As  for  the  risk  of \nrevenue  disruption  because  of  seismic  activities,  to  which  the  project  site  is  prone,  it  will  be \nmitigated through compliance with the appropriate seismic design codes on all aspects such as \ncivil,  structures,  and  building.  With  insurance  policies  and  contingency  budget  in  place,  the \nproject faces reduced risk from other natural hazards such as flooding, landslides, and volcanic \nactivity. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n24. \nTransmission  Risk.    PLN  is  working  under  an  accelerated  program  to  complete  the \nrequisite  transmission  line  and  switchyard.    PLN  is  not  liable  for  underperformance  in  the \nacceleration  program  or  additional  delays.      Close  monitoring  of  PLN\u2019s  progress  on  the \nTransmission  Line  is  recommended  for  SEML  and  the  OE.    PLN  delay  is  mitigated  by  a  $3.6 \n\n                                                 \n19 Some limited transmission risk arises from dependence on PLN for construction of both the substation and an 80 \nkm  transmission  line  needed  to  deliver  the  plant\u2019s  electricity  output  to  the  Sumatra  grid.  However,  SEML  is \nprotected  by  deemed  dispatch  provisions  under  the  PPA  if  project  completion  is  hampered  by  PLN  construction \ndelays. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nmillion  contingency  allocation  for  a  generator  set  to  back  feed  generated  power  for \ncommissioning and dispatch until the transmission line is completed. \n \n25. \nLegal and regulatory risk. The lenders\u2019 legal advisors have provided sufficient comfort \nregarding the ownership structure and commitments under the various project agreements. The \noverall regulatory risk in the geothermal subsector is expected to be minimal, given the priority \nand support the government has accorded the project. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n26. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. \n \n27. \nExploration began in 2012, and construction of the access roads and well pads is almost \ncomplete.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project  were  identified  and \neffective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and  compensate  for  any  adverse  impacts  are \nincorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and  plans.  The  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of \nSEML  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate. \nMeaningful consultation was undertaken and a grievance redress mechanism was established. \nA  3.2  km  transmission  line  and  a  proposed  new  substation  to  be  constructed  by  PLN  are \nconsidered associated facilities. PLN has not begun the permitting or AMDAL20 process and no \nconsideration of impacts from the transmission line or substation was undertaken to date. The \nsponsors carried out an audit of the existing facility and committed to a corrective action plan in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  audit  found  that  the  project  is \ncomplying with ambient environmental standards. The project location is adjacent to a national \npark and because threatened species have been observed in the area, the project is considered \nto be located in a critical habitat. However, the project has a very small footprint (70 hectares) \ncompared with the overall area of the species\u2019 discrete management unit (672 square km).21 A \nbiodiversity  action  plan  was  prepared,  which  includes  both  long-term  biodiversity  conservation \nactions and on-site mitigation measures linked to the construction and operation activities of the \nproject. Threats to biodiversity primarily result from community exploitation of forest fauna and \nflora. Given the small project footprint and the conservation actions to be taken, which include \ncommunity  socialization,  the  project  has  the  potential  to  make  a  positive  biodiversity \ncontribution. ADB will closely monitor the remaining construction and operational activities with \na particular focus on the implementation of the biodiversity action plan. \n \n28. \nThe  acquisition  of  the  141.8  hectares  of  land  required  for  the  project  facilities  was \ncompleted through negotiated settlements by SEML. The lands procured were state-controlled \nfree lands utilized for cultivation by the 221 affected households, and not part of any traditional \nlands  or  lands  with  customary  rights.  An  audit  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and  compliance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement requirements  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  impacts \non indigenous peoples was carried out. The audit\u2014based on site visits and consultations with \n                                                 \n20 Analysis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan (environmental and social impact assessment). \n21 \u201cDiscrete  management  unit\u201d  is  defined  in  IFC.  2010.

Washington,  DC  as  an  area  with  a \ndefinable boundary within which the character of biological communities and/or management issues have more in \ncommon with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas. \n\n\f 8\n\naffected persons; review of signed and notarized land agreements with the affected households \nand  verification  of  land  acquisition  records  maintained  by  SEML,  including  the  cash \ncompensation  receipts  signed  by  the  affected  households;  and  bank  account  details  of  the \naffected persons\u2014confirmed that all 221 project-affected households were fully compensated at \nthe  negotiated  rates,  and  no  outstanding  grievances  regarding  land  procurement  and \ncompensation  exist.  The  audit  confirms  that  the  affected  households,  mostly  belonging  to \nMinang  ethnic  group,  fully  support  the  project.  To  bridge  the  gaps  identified  in  the  audit, \ncorrective actions were determined and agreed on with the borrower. A resettlement framework \nwas prepared to guide PLN\u2019s land procurement process for the 3.2 km transmission line, and is \nexpected  to  be  carried  out  in  2017  through  negotiated  land  acquisition  with  nontitled  users \ncultivating on state-controlled free lands. \n \n29. \nSEML  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.22 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on (i) its (and its contractors\u2019) compliance \nwith  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  taken.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  with \naffected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n30. \nSEML  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  in \ncombating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n31. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \n32. \nCharter), 23  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of Indonesia has no objection to the proposed assistance to PT. Supreme Energy \nMuara  Laboh.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the  proposed  assistance  by  the  ADB  Board  of \nDirectors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  up  to \n$70,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  PT.
