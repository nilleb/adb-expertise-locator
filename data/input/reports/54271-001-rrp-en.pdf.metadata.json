The proposed policy actions are critical in dealing \nwith the economic impact of COVID-19 and ensuring macroeconomic stability in the medium to \nlong term, while continuing to protect the livelihoods of those most affected by the crisis. Delaying \nthe  policy  actions  would  expose  the  government  to  unplanned  increases  in  the  fiscal  deficit \nbecause  of  fiscal  risks  that  are  more  likely  to  materialize  during  the  ongoing  crisis,  continued \naccumulation  of  foreign-currency-denominated  debt,  and  higher  exposure  to  currency  and \nrefinancing risks. At the same time, immediate reforms are needed to safeguard the well-being of \nolder adults, many of whom have lost some of their supplementary sources of income as a result \nof  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy, \n2019\u20132023 for Georgia. \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints  \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nGeorgia\u2019s public health response broadly effective in containing spread of COVID-\n19. As of 29 September 2020, Georgia had confirmed 5,552 cases since the outbreak of COVID-\n19, with 2,054 recoveries and 32 fatalities.3 From the outset, the country imposed health checks \non incoming air passengers and ramped up restrictions on movement as the first cases emerged. \nThe  government\u2019s  clear  and  consistent  communication  strategy  was  instrumental  in  avoiding \nwidespread  contagion.  The  phased  lifting  of  lockdown  measures  was  underpinned  by \nrecommendations from health professionals to help prevent a resurgence of cases,4 and public \ncompliance with these recommendations kept the incidence low. Despite a sharp increase in the \nnumber of confirmed cases in September 2020, Georgia\u2019s number of confirmed cases remains \none of the lowest in the region and remains retain one of the lowest case-mortality rates among \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. \n \n4. \nThe  COVID-19  pandemic  has  had  a  significant  negative  impact  on  Georgia\u2019s \neconomy. While the drop in remittances and exports was less severe than initially envisioned, it \ndid not offset the adverse impact of a marked slowdown in the tourism industry and foreign direct \ninvestment.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  is  now  forecast  to  decelerate  to  \u20135.0%  in \n2020.5 The  revised  projections  are  based  on  recent  data  indicating  a  contraction  in  growth  of \n12.6% year-over-year for the second quarter of 2020, and an overall 5.8% contraction for the first \n\n \n\n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Asian Development Outlook Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\nhalf of 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, tourism revenues fell by $849 million year-over-year. \nThe impact of this on Georgia\u2019s external balance was partly offset by a reduced trade balance (\u2013\n$497  million  year-over-year)  as  imports  (\u201331.8%)  fell  more  than  exports  (\u201324.7%). 6  Also, \nincoming  remittances  rebounded  in  June 2020  with  a  year-over-year  increase  of  17.8%,  after \neconomic lockdowns across the globe had caused a sharp drop in April. The lari, which had hit a \nrecord  low  in  March  2020,  appreciated  by  6.9%  quarter-on-quarter  against  the  United  States \ndollar, reflecting adequate monetary policy responses by the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), as \nwell as external funding support and resilient remittances. Annual inflation in June 2020 was 6.1%, \ndriven  by  food  price  increases  because  of  supply  chain  disruptions  and  stronger  influence  of \nforeign exchange pass-through.7 \n \n5. \nImpact  on  public  finances  more  severe  than  expected.  The  COVID-19  pandemic \nsignificantly weakened Georgia\u2019s fiscal position.8 Revenue and grants are expected to decline by \n10.5% in the revised budget, compared with the original budget for 2020, led by a 12.1% drop in \ntax  revenues,  while  expenditure  is  expected  to  increase  by  10.2%. 9  To  accommodate  the \nsignificant  increase  in  public  expenditure  needed  to  finance  Georgia's  Anti-Crisis  Plan,  the \ngovernment sought to create fiscal space in the revised budget 2020.10 Recurrent expenditure on \nwages and salaries was lowered by 2.7%, and on goods and services by 1.6%, compared with \nthe original 2020 state budget. But despite these efforts, the financing gap for 2020 widened to \n$1.6 billion, from an estimated $1.5 billion in May 2020 (footnote 9). To bridge this financing gap, \nexternal borrowing is expected to increase by an additional GEL4.3 billion, and domestic debt is \nset  to  rise  by  GEL649  million.  Despite  the  lari\u2019s  continued  depreciation  during  2014\u20132019, \nGeorgia's  ratio  of  general  government  debt  to  GDP  remained  below  42%  during  2017\u20132019. \nHowever, general government debt will increase sharply to 57.9% of GDP in 2020, from 41.2% in \n2019. While the authorities have a medium-term plan to gradually reduce government debt as a \nshare  of  GDP  to  54.3%  by  2024,11 rollover,  currency,  and  contingency  risks  may  disrupt  this \ntrajectory (footnote 7). The fiscal deficit increased sharply to 8.5% in 2020, from 2.2% in 2019, \nwell above the 3.0% ceiling of the Economic Liberty Act.12  \n \n6. \nExternal general government debt magnifying vulnerabilities to economic shocks.  \nDomestic markets in Georgia are not sufficiently liquid to fund the public financing needs entirely. \nTo  address  this  shortcoming,  the  government  is  seeking  foreign  currency  financing  from \ndevelopment partners to fund its ambitious countercyclical development expenditure program. As \na  result,  the  share  of  foreign-currency-denominated  government  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  in \nGeorgia is expected to increase from 31.5% in 2019 to 45.9% in 2020.13 This in turn increases \npublic exposure to foreign currency and refinancing risks.14 The rising costs of foreign-currency-\ndenominated  debt  repayments  associated  with  depreciation  of  the  lari  may  pose  a  significant \nthreatening \nburden  on  public \n\nfinances,  crowding  out  essential  social  spending  and \n\n \n\n6  National Bank of Georgia (NBG). 2020.

Ministry of Finance (MOF). 2020. Basic Economic and Financial Indicators (accessed 06 \nOctober 2020). \n\n12 The Economic Liberty Act, adopted in 2011 and effective since 2014, established numerical upper limits for general \ngovernment debt (60% of GDP), and the budget balance (3% of GDP). Public debt and budget balance rules have \nbeen adhered to since their introduction.. \n\n13 MOF. 2020. Basic Economic and Financial Indicators (accessed 15 August 2020). \n14 The large share of foreign currency debt affects the figure for general government debt as a share of GDP, which \n\nfluctuates in line with the exchange rate.  \n\n\f3 \n\nmacroeconomic stability needed for economic recovery. Despite efforts to diversify the currency \ncomposition of the government debt portfolio, external debt accounts for roughly 80% of general \ngovernment  debt,  and  most  of  that  is  denominated  in  United  States  dollars.15 The  continued \nreliance on external and foreign-currency-denominated financing undermines efforts to deepen \ndomestic  debt  markets  and  increases  public  exposure  to  external  risks,  while  limiting  the \neffectiveness of countercyclical monetary and fiscal policies.  \n\n \n7. \nMedium-term plan to narrow fiscal deficit. As a response to the sharp increase in the \nfiscal  deficit  in  2020,  the  authorities  adopted  a  medium-term  plan  to  gradually  bring  the  fiscal \ndeficit below 3% by 2024.16 However, the risk of a protracted crisis may prompt the extension of \nthe  temporary  social  protection  measures  and  lead  to  lower  growth  and  revenues  in  2021 \n(footnote 8). This could create a need for more expenditure going into 2021 and, depending on \nhow global, regional, and domestic economic dynamics unfold, may slow the rebound in economic \nactivity and keep revenues below expectations. Higher than planned fiscal deficits in the medium \nterm could frustrate the government\u2019s plan to minimize its borrowing needs and, in the absence \nof  deeper  domestic  markets,  increase  the  exposure  to  refinancing  and  currency  risks. 17 It  is \ntherefore  imperative  that  the  government  continue  to  deepen  money  markets  for  government \nsecurities, thereby increasing overall market liquidity and predictability, while further creating an \nenabling policy and legislative environment for capital market development.18  \n \nIncreasing the share of lari-denominated general government debt. Between 2017 \n8. \nand 2019, the government began to gradually reduce its reliance on external debt. Domestic debt \nas a share of GDP increased from 7% in 2017 to 9.7% in 2019, whereas external debt as a share \nof GDP declined from 32.4% to 31.5% in the same period. Likewise, domestic debt as a share of \ntotal  government  debt  increased  from  17.8%  in  2017  to  23.5%  in  2019.  While  the  COVID-19 \npandemic  partly  disrupted  this  balance\u2014the  share  of  domestic  debt  as  a  share  of  total \ngovernment  debt  declined  from  23.5%  in  2019  to  20.7%  in  2020\u2014the  government  remains \ncommitted to this policy objective. During 2020\u20132024, it plans to gradually increase domestic debt \nas  a  share  of  government  debt  from  20.7%  to  30.0%.  The  proposed  program  supports  the \ngovernment in this endeavor by promoting institutional reforms that further deepen the domestic \ndebt  market  for  government  securities. 19 This  will  help  minimize  public  exposure  to  stability-\nthreatening refinancing and currency risks, which is a prerequisite for economic recovery.20 The \nprogram therefore supports policy actions that further strengthen money market infrastructure for \ngovernment  securities  on  the  one  hand,  while  simultaneously  supporting  the  development  of \ncapital markets on the other hand. Deepening the market for treasury securities is an essential \nprecondition for the good functioning of other components of the capital market, since the treasury \nyield curve plays an important role in the pricing of the other securities (footnote 17). The program \nsupports continued and enhanced collaboration between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \nNBG to expand the issuance of benchmark bonds and thereby boost the liquidity, transparency, \nand  predictability  of  the  market.  This  will  increase  investors\u2019  interest  in  domestic  government \nsecurities  and  correspondingly  expand  the  investor  base.  In  turn,  the  development  of  capital \nmarkets will accelerate the de-dollarization process and improve monetary policy transmission on \n\n \n\n15 International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

Although \n9. \nGeorgia\u2019s  public  sector  balance  sheet  is  relatively  healthy,22 increased  exposure  to  fiscal  risks \narising from power purchase agreements (PPAs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) jeopardize \nthe  short-  and  medium-term  fiscal  sustainability  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  (footnote  15).  The \nlarge SOE segment, with its high exposure to foreign exchange risks, represents a net draw on \nthe budget\u2014SOEs\u2019 imminent financing needs of about 18% of GDP23 threaten the fiscal stability \nthat  underpins  an  economic  recovery. 24 A  reclassification  of  state  enterprises  confirmed  the \nexistence of 196 SOEs in the general government sector\u2014highlighting the dependence of many \nSOEs  on  government  funding  and  the  role  of  government  in  their  management  decisions. \nMoreover,  of  the  six  largest  SOEs,  only  one  generates  sufficient  operating  profits  to  cover  its \ncapital  costs,  while  all  others  incur  significant  losses.  Overall,  the  SOE  segment  has  drawn  a \ncumulative 6% of GDP from the government budget between 2015 and 2020. By IMF estimates, \na 30% depreciation of the lari from its August 2020 rate would reduce the net worth of the largest \nSOEs by about 4% of GDP, affecting the health of the government\u2019s fiscal position (footnote 15). \nSeveral major SOEs are also exposed to significant foreign exchange mismatches in their assets \nand liabilities.25   \n \n10. \nExisting guarantees under PPAs are set to increase fiscal pressures, threatening the path \nto macroeconomic stability. Although the payment of PPA guarantees is to be met largely through \nuser  fees,  residual  payments  are  worth  22%  of  GDP  over  40  years.26 These  payments  could \ndouble  under  plausible  scenarios,  highlighting  the  need  to  manage  these  risks  effectively \n(footnote  15).  Recent  fiscal  projections  on  the  long-term  implications  of  more  than  150  PPAs \ncommit the  government to ensuring minimum  revenues\u2014or  in some cases, returns\u2014to  power \ngenerators over a 50-year-plus period worth about 65% of GDP. The major challenge posed by \nfiscal risks stemming from PPAs and SOEs is the lack of data and difficulty of incorporating it into \nthe budgeting process. Failure to properly reflect contingent liabilities in the budget framework, \nespecially during a crisis, can lead to expenditure overruns and fiscal pressures. Such a risk would \nfurther  jeopardize  an  inclusive  and  sustainable  recovery  in the  country  and  require  immediate \naction. \n \n\n \n\n21 G. Abuselidze. 2018. Georgia\u2019s Capital Market: Functioning problems and development directions in association with \n\nEuropean Union. Journal of Applied Economic Sciences, 13(7):1929-1938.  \n\n22 Total assets across all government-controlled entities equal 149% of GDP, while liabilities are worth 81% of GDP, \n\nleaving a positive net worth of 68% of GDP (footnote 15). \n\n23  It is estimated that the gross financing requirements of the six major SOEs total about GEL7.6 billion (18% of GDP) \nduring 2021\u20132024. This includes about $350 million and \u20ac150 million by Georgian Oil and Gas Corporation (GOGC), \nand $400 million by Georgia Rail (footnote 15).  \n\n24 SOEs have been a large financial drain on government finances, with little contribution to public revenues. During \n2014\u20132018,  net  flows  to  SOEs  totaled  GEL2.6  billion,  while  the  government's  GEL4.6  billion  equity  investment \ngenerated very little or no dividends. The costs of SOE financing could place additional strain on the fiscal balance \nin the future, widening the fiscal deficit and, as a result, the ratio of general government debt to GDP. Moreover, \nSOEs require gross financing of GEL7.6 billion during 2020\u20132022, partly for refinancing and new financing (footnote \n15).  \n\n25 Some  SOEs, such  as  Georgia  Rail,  do  receive  revenues  in  foreign  currencies,  providing  a  partial  hedge  against \ncurrency  fluctuations,  but  overall  the  major  SOEs  are  heavily  exposed  to  depreciations\u2014particularly  against  the \nUnited States dollar and the euro\u2014since most of their debt is denominated in foreign currency (footnote 15). \n\n26 Annual payments for existing guarantees under PPAs are set to peak in 2024 at 0.6% of GDP under a favorable \n\nscenario (footnote 15).  \n\n\f5 \n\nStrengthening the management of fiscal risks. The government\u2019s ability to gradually \n11. \nnarrow  the  fiscal  deficit  to  the  3%  ceiling  specified  in  the  Economic  Liberty  Act  hinges  on  its \ncapacity to avert unplanned fiscal expenditures that may arise when fiscal risks materialize. These \nrisks  include  (i)  the  materialization  of  obligations  to  provide  minimum  guarantees  under  some \nPPAs, as described in para. 9; (ii) exposure to natural disaster risks; and (iii) foreign exchange \nexposure  and  potential  recapitalization  requirements  of  the  large  SOE  sector  (footnote  15). \nInstitutional reforms that make it possible to identify, disclose, and prepare for such risks can help \navert  unplanned  fiscal  pressures  and  the  associated  impacts  on  the  fiscal  deficit  and  general \ngovernment  debt.  International  experience  indicates  that  the  materialization  of  contingent \nliabilities, especially when coupled with exchange rate depreciation, was one of the most common \ncauses of unexpected increases in the general government debt\u2013GDP ratio during 2007\u20132019.27 \nContingent liabilities stemming from natural disasters, for example, have historically been as high \nas 10% of GDP in some countries.28  \n \n12. \nExperience from the global financial crisis of 2008\u2014and the numerous episodes of SOE \nand bank recapitalization, and materialization of obligations to provide minimum guarantees under \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) and PPAs\u2014serves to remind us how disruptive such risks can \nbecome  to  fiscal  and  debt  stability.29 This  includes  fiscal  risks  from  unfunded  or  underfunded \npolicy  mandates  executed  by  SOEs.  In  addition  to  providing  a  more  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment,  insulating  public  exposure  to  these  unplanned  fiscal  pressures  helps  minimize \nopportunity costs for scarce public resources, which in turn creates additional fiscal space for key \nsocial spending and public investment priorities. \n \n13. \nCOVID-19's  impact  on  social  welfare  indicators.  Preliminary  estimates  from  the \nMonitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Lab\u2014set up with ADB support under the COVID-19 \nActive Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program\u2014suggest that the Anti-Crisis Plan \nwill  mitigate  a  considerable  surge  in  poverty  incidence  and  loss  of  income  across  the  income \ngroups.30 While the impact of the COVID-19 crisis would have certainly been much worse if no \nAnti-Crisis Plan had been in place, the poverty head-count is expected to increase in 2020 across \nvarious poverty lines (Table 1).  \n \n\nTable 1: Impact of COVID-19 on Poverty Head-count Under Different Scenarios And \nDifferent Poverty Lines \n\nScenario \n\n$1.9 PPP \n\n$3.2 PPP \n\n$5.5 PPP \n\n$10 PPP \n\nBaseline (2019) \nImpact of COVID without Anti-Crisis Plan \nImpact of COVID with Anti-Crisis Plan \nMitigating impact of the Anti-Crisis Plan \n\n4.5 \n19.9 \n8.6 \n11.3 \n\n15.7 \n37.5 \n23 \n14.5 \n\n42.9 \n63.0 \n49.7 \n13.3 \n\n77.9 \n87.7 \n80.1 \n7.6 \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, PPP = purchasing power parity. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14. \nReforms  to  protect the  elderly.

This \nhighlights  the  importance  of  an  adequate  and reliable  social  pension  system  to  avoid  a  sharp \nincrease  in  the  old-age  poverty  incidence.  This  is  particularly  important  for  women,  who \nconstituted 71% of all universal pension beneficiaries in August 2020 and who rely on pension \npayouts  for  their  livelihoods.  Women's  life  expectancy  (78.2  years)  is  higher  than  men's \n(69.7 years), suggesting that women's reliance on the pension system is also higher than men's\u2014\non average, women live 17.2 years and men live 3.6 years on a pension. The COVID-19 crisis \nalso highlighted that the pension system, in addition to providing a financial lifeline to the elderly, \nhelps  prevent  a  steeper  resurgence  of  poverty  levels  in  households  with  at  least  one  pension \nrecipient. As the figure below illustrates, households with one or more pensioners witnessed a \nproportionally smaller increase in the poverty incidence. Overall, the COVID-19 crisis shed light \non how the right reforms to the pension system can ensure the social well-being of the largest \ngroup of vulnerable people in Georgia, i.e., not only senior citizens but also households with at \nleast one pension beneficiary.34 \n \n\nFigure 1: Poverty Headcount by Households (none, one, or two pensioners, Scenario Analysis \n\n50.4\n\n34.4\n\n19.3\n\n44.6\n\n27.6\n\n13.6\n\n40.2\n\n25.6\n\n16.8\n\n34.3\n\n20.9\n\n12\n\n29.6\n\n18.1\n\n12.5\n\n24.3\n\n14\n\n8.3\n\n$3.2 line\n\n \n\n \n\nNational poverty\nline\n\n$3.2 line\n\nNational poverty\nline\n\n$3.2 line\n\nNational poverty\nline\n\nNo pensioner\n\nOne pensioner\n\nTwo or more pensioners\n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nBaseline\n\nLockdown\n\nMitigation\n\n \nReforms  to  the  pension  system.

The reform of the pension system \nbegan in 2014\u20132015 with an assessment of the existing arrangements, after which the cabinet \nadopted  a  pension  reform  policy  proposing  to  (i)  link  future  increases  of  the  universal  basic \npension to inflation and (ii) introduce an additional contributory (Pillar II). The initial assessment, \nundertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable  Development  and  supported  by  ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA), concluded that while the universal pension system did play a significant \nrole  in  reducing  poverty,  it  did  not  provide  a  decent  standard  of  living  to  its  beneficiaries. 35 \nProjections  on  future  liabilities  taking  into  account  demographic  trends 36 suggested  that  the \n\n \n\n32 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 2014.

About  20.5%  of  old-age  pensioners  are  classified  as  disabled  (58.6%  of  the  total \nnumber  of  disabled  people  in the country.).

Tbilisi. \n\n\f7 \n\nuniversal pension system was not fiscally sustainable, given that it was to be financed exclusively \nfrom  the  state  budget.37 Specifically,  the  practice  of  ad-hoc  indexation  of  the  universal  basic \npension  resulted  in  unplanned  fiscal  pressures,  thwarting  efforts  to  achieve  better  budget \npredictability. The assessment report recommended that (i) universal pension payouts be raised \nto subsistence levels to avoid rises in old-age poverty; (ii) the government adopt a mechanism for \nthe  indexation  of  universal  pensions  to  maintain  their  purchasing  value;  (iii)  the  government \nestablish  and  operationalize  a  contributory  pension  savings  scheme  (Pillar  II);  and  (iv)  the \nuniversal pension scheme and contributory pension scheme be complemented with a fully private \npension  scheme  (Pillar  III). 38 In  line  with  these  policy  recommendations,  the  government  (i) \ngradually  increased  universal  pension  payouts  to  a  pre-determined  subsistence  level  and \nprovided an additional increase for those aged 70 and above; and (ii) effectively established and \noperationalized the contributory pension scheme (Pillar II), which is administered by the Pension \nAgency, a legal entity of public law. These measures are particularly beneficial for women, who \nconstitute  71%  of  all  universal  pension  beneficiaries  and  roughly  65%  of  universal  pension \nbeneficiaries older than 70. Further, to ensure fiscal sustainability of the pension system more \nbroadly, an indexation mechanism has been recently approved and the operationalization of the \ncontributory pension scheme was completed. This way, Georgia\u2019s pension scheme can maintain \nits role of poverty alleviation at fiscally affordable levels. The purchasing power of pensioners will \nremain stable since ad-hoc increases in the pension amount will no longer be common practice \n(footnote 32). The government remains committed to establishing a fully private pension scheme \nas soon as possible while continuing to improve the efficiency of the Pillar II pension scheme. \n \n16. \nAnti-Crisis  Plan  expected  to  contain  rise  in  unemployment.  Formal  unemployment \nrose from 11.6% at the end of 2019 to 12.3% in the second quarter of 2020.39 The full impact of \nCOVID-19 on unemployment levels will not be evident until the end of 2020. That said, preliminary \nestimates suggest that in 2020 roughly 385,000 people, or about 23.4% of the employed, face a \nhigh risk of job displacement.40 The impact on the self-employed might be milder since roughly \n75% of them work in agriculture, which was less affected during the lockdown than other sectors \n(footnote 40). At the same time, the below-average baseline earnings of the self-employed may \nrequire special policy emphasis.41 To try and mitigate mass retrenchment and loss of income, the \ngovernment  adopted  ambitious  employment  preservation  measures:  (i)  an  unemployment \nassistance benefit (direct transfer of GEL1,200 over 6 months); (ii) an income tax waiver for low-\nincome citizens (exempting firms from income tax for citizens with monthly incomes of less than \nGEL750, provided workers are kept on the payroll); and (iii) informal sector assistance (one-off \npayment of GEL300).42 As the economy begins to recover and these benefits are gradually lifted, \nit  is  expected  that  significant  parts  of  the  population  will  not  have  job  opportunities  and  the \nunemployment rate will widen. Employment preservation and cash transfer measures targeting \nthe poorest members of society are expected to limit the increase in poverty incidence. Table 1 \nshows  that  even  if  the  government\u2019s  Anti-Crisis  Plan  mitigates  the  increase  in  the  poverty \nheadcount index across the income distribution curve as anticipated, the increase is nonetheless \nexpected  to  be  substantial.  The  government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  need  to  reform  the  social \nprotection  systems  to  mitigate  the  medium-term  impact  of  COVID-19  on  unemployment  and \npoverty, and to do so in a fiscally sustainable and gender-sensitive fashion.

To this end, the program is composed \nof  two  subprograms  that  assist  the  government's  reform  efforts  across  three  main  areas: \n(i) strengthening the management of public exposure to fiscal risks, which was magnified by the \nCOVID-19 crisis; (ii) deepening the domestic debt markets for government securities to mitigate \npublic  exposure  to  risks  associated  with  external  shocks,  such  as  the  need  for  further  fiscal \nstimulus to cushion the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19; and (iii) strengthening the adequacy \nand fiscal sustainability of social protection programs to safeguard the livelihoods of those most \naffected by the COVID-19 crisis. The institutional challenges across these three areas require a \nphased and programmatic approach. The focus of subprogram 1 is on policy actions that either \naddress  an  immediate  need  or  that  lay  the  foundation  for  more  tangible  policy  reforms  under \nsubprogram  2.  The total  budget  support  provided  under  the  program  is  $300  million,  of  which \n\u20ac170,823,000  ($200 million  equivalent)  are to  be  disbursed  upon  approval  of  subprogram  1  in \nOctober 2020, and $100 million under subprogram 2 in 2021.  \n \nReform area 1: Strengthening management of public exposure to fiscal risks. The \n18. \nobjective is to strengthen the management of public exposure to fiscal risks stemming from PPPs, \nPPAs, and/or SOEs to mitigate the risk of a hidden deficit and avoid a further decrease in fiscal \nspace  to  support  an  inclusive  and  sustainable  recovery.  Under  subprogram  1,  MOF  fully \noperationalized  the  Fiscal  Risk  Management  Division,  a  dedicated  unit  to  assess  and  quantify \npublic  exposure  to  fiscal  risks  stemming  from  SOEs  and  PPPs,  which  are  more  likely  to \nmaterialize as a result of the COVID-19 crisis; the division numbers at least six technical staff, \nand at least 75% of them are women. MOF also approved the PPP Guidelines, which include a \nguide  to  the  assessment  of  contingent  liabilities  and  a  value-for-money  approach  to  PPP \nevaluations, completing a PPP framework that ensures adequate identification, monitoring, and \nreporting of fiscal risk stemming from PPPs. MOF, through the Fiscal Risk Management Division, \nexpanded  the  scope  of  its  fiscal  risk  statement  to  include  (i)  disclosure  and  discussion  of \nmethodological instructions to identify, quantify, finance, and report the quasi-fiscal activities of \nSOEs;  (ii)  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  the  likelihood  that  fiscal  risks  stemming  from \nSOEs materialize in the short-to-medium term; (iii) expansion of the fiscal risk analysis of SOEs \nfrom 12 to 13 individual entities; (iv) discussion on the effect of SOE sectorization on public finance \nstatistics, including the impact on the Law of Georgia on Public Debt; (v) analysis of SOEs from \na sector perspective, with the aim of normalizing financial statements from SOEs; (vi) assessment \nof  the  stock  of  PPP  liabilities  based  on  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards \n(IPSAS32)  and  on  the  value-for-money  approach  to  PPP  evaluations  (included  in  the  recently \napproved PPP Guidelines); and a draft discussion of fiscal risks stemming from natural disasters \nand affecting municipalities.  \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the government  will  revise  the  legislative framework  for  the  SOE \n19. \nsegment, increase MOF\u2019s role in SOE-related fiscal risk management, develop a formal system \nto account and fund community service obligations, and increase SOEs' accountability. Second, \nMOF will publish a ministerial statement that covers (i) the rationale for SOE ownership; (ii) the \n\n\f9 \n\ncompetitive neutrality of SOEs; (iii) an analysis of corporate governance practices against OECD \nguidelines;  and  (iv)  merit-based  appointments  of  supervisory  boards  for  all  SOEs  defined  as \npublic interest entities with regard to 90% of their annual turnover. This ministerial statement will \ninform reforms to SOEs' corporate governance. Third, MOF will define and disclose fiscal risks \nstemming from natural disasters, including climate-change-related disasters, and publish them on \nits website to ensure comprehensive identification and reporting of fiscal risks. Finally, MOF will \nsubmit to Parliament an amendment to the Law of Georgia on Public Debt to expand the coverage \nof public sector debt statistics, which will help strengthen the management of fiscal risks.  \n \n20. \nReform area 2: Deepening domestic market for government securities. The objective \nis to manage the adverse effects associated with high public sector exposure to foreign-currency-\ndenominated  debt,  which  was  amplified  by  the  COVID-19  crisis.  To  this  end,  the  program \npromotes institutional reforms that help further deepen the domestic debt market for government \nsecurities and, ultimately, reduce the share of general government debt denominated in foreign \ncurrency.  This  will  help  minimize  public  exposure  to  the  refinancing  and  currency  risks  that \nthreaten  macroeconomic  stability,  which  is  a  prerequisite  for  economic  recovery.  Under \nsubprogram  1,  MOF  and  the  NBG  commenced  a  primary  dealer  pilot  and  defined  the  rights, \nobligations, and rules for a future primary dealer system to promote activity  in the primary and \nsecondary  markets  to  reduce  public  reliance  on  external  debt  to  finance  future  fiscal  stimulus \npackages such as the Anti-Crisis Plan. Second, MOF issued a ministerial decree mandating that \nthe debt management strategy be updated, approved, and published on its website on an annual \nbasis to increase the predictability of the market for the government's domestic debt securities. \nThird, MOF issued benchmark bonds with a cumulative nominal value of at least GEL2 billion in \n2020  to  boost  investor  interest  in  Georgian  government  securities  and  promote  capital  market \ndevelopment, which in turn will ensures the growth of lari liquidity. Finally, Parliament approved \nthe Investment Funds Law defining the legal, regulatory, and tax framework for investment funds, \nto create an enabling environment for the development of capital markets in Georgia.  \n \nUnder subprogram 2, MOF and NBG will add at least one new tenor to the primary dealer \n21. \npilot and publish their plan for moving to a full-fledged primary dealer system. Second, MOF will \nmandate  primary  dealers  to  disclose  and  make  publicly  available  all  pre-trade  and  post-trade \nfigures for all securities included in the  primary dealer system. Third, MOF will approve a new \ndebt management strategy for 2021\u20132023, which includes an increase in the stock of domestic \ndebt to at least 10% of GDP by October 2023 to deepen the domestic debt market for government \nsecurities. Fourth, MOF will adopt a strategy to develop retail participation in the government bond \nmarket,  which,  subject  to  deliberations  with  the  NBG,  may  include  a  savings-certificate-style \nmarket issued electronically. Fifth, the government, in collaboration with the NBG, will approve a \ncapital  market  development  strategy  to  promote  the  mobilization  of  domestic  private  financial \nresources available to the government, which will minimize its reliance on external financing. Sixth, \nthe government will submit to Parliament a draft Law on Securitization to deepen capital markets \nby creating a new class of debt instruments and allowing market access to new participants, such \nas corporate players. Finally, the government will submit a draft law on covered bonds to deepen \ndomestic capital markets by widening the range of investment instruments available to investors. \n \n22. \nReform  area  3:  Ensuring  adequacy  and  fiscal  sustainability  of  social  protection \nprograms that were expanded during the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant \nimpact  on  the  financial  well-being  of  senior  citizens.  To  manage  this  issue,  the  government \nembarked on reforms to ensure the adequacy and fiscal sustainability of the pension scheme. \nThe pandemic also highlighted the need to reform other social protection systems, so as to ensure \nthat all those affected are given adequate financial support and to increase the social resilience \nof the country in case of a new crisis. The ADB program will support the government in these \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ninitiatives to ensure that Georgia\u2019s social protection infrastructure can underpin an inclusive return \nto economic growth. Under subprogram 1, Parliament approved the revised 2020 budget, which \nincludes an increase of at least GEL30 in the universal pension payouts to beneficiaries aged 70 \nand above, 65% of whom are women; this will mitigate the adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis \non  old-age  poverty.  Parliament  also  approved  an  amendment  to the  Law  of  Georgia  on  State \nPensions, which introduces a rules-based mechanism for increases in universal pension payouts \nto  beneficiaries,  70%  of  whom  are  women.  Further,  the  government  established  and \noperationalized  the  independent  Pension  Agency  to  administer  the  new  supplementary \ncontributory pension scheme (Pillar II pension scheme); at least 50% of the agency's staff are \nwomen.  The  Pension  Agency  then  ensured  the  registration  of  100%  of  formal  employers  and \ncollected  contributions  from  at  least  90%  of  registered  employers,  as  well  as  associated \ncontributions  from  the  government  and  employees.  Finally,  the  Pension  Agency  adopted  an \ninterim Cash and Cash Equivalent Investment Policy, which allows investments to be managed \nwithout  any  undue  risk  and  ensures  the  transfer  of  all  contribution  payments  into  individual, \ninterest-bearing accounts. Under subprogram 2, the NBG and the Pension Agency will approve \nan  investment  policy  for  a  pension  savings  scheme  to  guide  the  long-term  investments  of \ncontributions.  The  Pension  Agency,  in  coordination  with  MOF,  will  approve  an  enforcement \nmechanism for pension scheme contributions to strengthen compliance by all formal employers \nwith the Law of Georgia on Pension Savings. To complement the Pillar II pension scheme, the \ngovernment will submit to Parliament the draft Law on Third Pillar Pensions to enable Georgian \nworkers  to  accumulate  additional  voluntary  savings,  whenever  possible,  and  generate  a  third \nsource of old-age income. \n \n23. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  program  forms  part  of  a  broader  package  of  support  to \nGeorgia  to  manage  the  health  and  socioeconomic  impacts  of  COVID-19.  It  complements  the \nCARES Program approved in May 202043 by supporting long-term institutional reforms that also \nhelp address the  immediate  institutional  fragilities  exposed by the  COVID-19  crisis,  and  which \npave the way for sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. The need to accelerate long-term \ninstitutional  reforms  to  manage  an  immediate  crisis  situation  justifies  the  use  of  the  fast-track \nprocedure. The program builds on more than a decade of close cooperation across key policy \nreform areas, such as fiscal risk management, public debt management, and social protection. \nSince 2014, ADB has been continuously engaged in policy dialogue with the government, and \nthe fiscal management and social  protection  reforms  supported  by  ADB  TA  helped  strengthen \npublic  debt  management  and  fiscal  risk  management  while  supporting  government  efforts  to \nreform  its  public  pension  system44\u2014the  largest  social  protection program  in the  country.45 The \nMEL  Lab,  an  innovative  solution  forged  under  the  CARES  Program,  helped  guide  the  policy \ndiscussions  around  the  proposed  program  and will  keep  on  providing  the  evidence  needed  to \ninform  the  final  shape  of  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2.  The  lab  provides  ADB  and  the \ngovernment with live data on the evolution of key socioeconomic indicators, necessary to support \nan adequate and timely policy response to emerging needs. ADB has maintained a clear position \nwith regard to gender and poverty alleviation in these discussions with the government and will \ncontinue  to  do  so  in  the  future.  ADB\u2019s  financial  support  will  help  the  government  bridge  its \nfinancing  gap  for  2020  at  less  onerous  terms than  it  would otherwise  be able to  achieve, thus \ncontributing  to  debt  sustainability  in  the  long  run.  The  financing  support  provided  under  the \nprogram is complemented by other ADB sector development loans and policy-based loans, which \n\n \n\n43 ADB.  2020.

Underpinned  by  strong  country  knowledge,  the  program  is  also  informed  by \nlessons  from  previous  policy-based  support  to  Georgia. 47  Most  importantly,  ADB\u2019s  previous \nengagement in structural and politically sensitive policy reforms in Georgia, such as the reform of \nthe pension system and the development of a domestic debt market, highlighted the importance \nof  flexibility  and  sequencing  in  managing  bottlenecks.48 A  programmatic  approach  for  policy-\nbased lending, combined with TA, was deemed a suitable modality because it ensures flexibility \nand allows for adequate sequencing of reforms across the subprograms.  \n \n25. \nAlignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nspecifically  the  operational  priorities of  addressing poverty and reducing  inequality  (through  its \nsupport  for  social  protection,  which  is  expected  to  mitigate  an  increase  in  poverty  incidence); \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (through  gender-sensitive  targets  integrated  into  the \npolicy actions); and strengthening governance and institutional capacity (through support to public \ndebt management and fiscal risk management functions).49  \n \nC. \n \nThe country\u2019s overarching development objective is sustained and inclusive growth based \n26. \non  macroeconomic  stability,  as  enshrined  in  the  government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development \nstrategy, Georgia 2020.50 The effect of the reforms supported under the program will be the return \nto sustainable and inclusive economic growth, minimizing the exposure of Georgia\u2019s fiscal position \nto shocks caused by COVID-19 while safeguarding the welfare of the most vulnerable members \nof society. These reforms will primarily work through three transmission channels reflected in the \nPublic  Financial  Management  Reform  Strategy:51 (i)  management  of  public  exposure  to  fiscal \nrisks strengthened; (ii) domestic debt market for government securities deepened; (iii) adequacy \nand fiscal sustainability of social protection programs strengthened.  \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Development Partner Coordination \n\nImpacts of the Reforms \n\n27. \nDevelopment financing needs for 2020. Despite the government\u2019s efforts to reprioritize \nexpenditure  and  create  additional  fiscal  space,  the  financing  gap  for  fiscal  year  2020  (ending \n31 December 2020) remains considerably high at $1,613 million. The financing gap is to be closed \nprimarily  through  loans and  grants  from  development  partners  as  well  as  domestic  borrowing; \ngovernment  deposits  are  available to  weather  downside  risks,  if  necessary.  Besides  ADB,  the \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the IMF, the World Bank, and selected bilateral partners \nhave committed to assist Georgia in accessing finance (Table 2). ADB's budget support in 2020 \nwill tentatively total $530 million, or 30% of the total financing gap.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n46 ADB. 2020.

First,  although  $1,782  million  in  budget  support  have  been \ndiscussed with development partners, only $1,157 million have been signed by 24 August 2020, \nof which only $615 million have been disbursed thus far. As such, there is a risk that some of \nthese budget support programs are cancelled or delayed to 2021. Second, there is the possibility \nthat some cash and in-kind transfers under the Anti-Crisis Plan need to be extended beyond their \ninitial  6-month  term.  If  this  happens  the  financing  gap  would  have  to  be  revised  again.  Third, \nshould  these  resources  be  disbursed  and  the  financing  gap  kept  at  $1,613  million,  the \nGovernment of Georgia would be able to create a fiscal buffer of GEL2.7 billion which could also \nbe utilized if unexpected liquidity pressures materialize in 2021.52 \n \n29. \nClose coordination with development partners. The ADB team consulted and closely \ncoordinated with all development partners that are providing budget support to Georgia in 2020, \nespecially  those  providing  TA  to  public  debt  management,  fiscal  risk  management,  and  social \nprotection  reform. 53 Coordination  with  the  IMF  has  been  particularly  important  to  ensure  the \ncomplementarity  of  ADB's  support  with  the  IMF\u2019s  Extended  Financing  Facility,  especially  the \ncoordination  of  structural  benchmarks  and  quantitative  performance  criteria  with  regard  to  the \ncoverage and monitoring of fiscal risks, and the strengthening of SOEs' corporate governance. \n \n30. \nThe government has requested a loan of \u20ac170,823,000 ($200,000,000 equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the \nstraight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB.  \n \nE. \n \n31.  MOF  will  be  the  executing  agency.

The \nindicative  implementation  periods  are  December  2018\u2013October  2020  for  subprogram  1  and \nOctober  2020\u2013October  2021  for  subprogram  2.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).54 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n32. \nGovernance. Georgia's public financial management systems have improved significantly \nthanks to the implementation of the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy\u2014minimizing \nthe risks associated with poor financial management of the proposed program. According to the \nmost recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment, Georgia has \nsound systems in place for strategic budget planning, execution, and accounting and reporting.55 \nNotable improvements in fiscal discipline are reflected in (i) less variance of expenditure outturn \nfrom the budget, i.e., fewer administrative transfers of budgetary funds; (ii) robust execution rates \nfor revenue; and (iii) stronger oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from SOEs and PPPs, which the \nprogram supports. Georgia also improved its strategic allocation of resources through its multi-\nyear budgeting tool and the preparation of costed sector strategies. Finally, the use of resources \nfor service delivery has become more efficient, with more effective payroll controls, internal audit, \ntimelier and more regular reconciliation of accounts, and an expansion of the scope and nature \nof follow-up audits.  \n \n33. \nPoverty  and  gender.  The  proposed  program  supports  the  government  of  Georgia  in \nmanaging the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable, in particular \nthe elderly, who are disproportionally exposed to the consequences. Despite substantial gains, \nhouseholds  in Georgia remain  highly  vulnerable  to  shocks,  such  as  those  associated  with the \noutbreak of COVID-19, which is estimated to increase the national poverty headcount from 20.1% \nin 2019 to 28.5% in 2020.56 Further, while absolute poverty ($1.90/day) has declined sharply from \n12.2% in 2010 to an estimated 3.7% in 2020, the effects of COVID-19 could increase the poverty \nincidence to 8.6%.57 Georgia\u2019s current social welfare system covers a relatively high share of the \npopulation but may not be sufficient to meet the needs of its poorest citizens. As of 2018, only \n11.7%  of  Georgians  receive  a  subsistence  allowance  under  the  targeted  social  assistance, \nagainst 20.1% of people living under the national poverty line, suggesting that wider coverage \nmay be necessary. The proposed program introduces structural and institutional reforms that seek \nto  mitigate  increases  in  poverty  incidence,  especially  old-age  poverty,  while  also  including \nproactive gender mainstreaming features. Increases in pension payouts for  people aged 70 and \nabove is particularly relevant for women, who make up roughly 65% of all beneficiaries in this age \nbracket and who are disproportionately vulnerable to the adverse health and economic effects of \nthe COVID-19 crisis (para. 14). Further, indexing increases in pension payouts to maintain their \npurchasing power shields the women who benefit from the universal pension scheme (71% of \nbeneficiaries) against gradual loss of income and poverty. The program also ensures that newly \nor  recently  created  public  agencies  are  staffed  in  a  gender-sensitive manner.  For  instance,  at \nleast 50% of technical staff recruited for the Pension Agency are women. Likewise, 85% of all \ntechnical staff in the Fiscal Risk Management Division are women. The program is classified as \neffective gender mainstreaming.  \n\n \n\n54 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n55 PEFA  Secretariat.  2018.
