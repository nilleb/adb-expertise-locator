I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Third Financial Sector Program.1  \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  development  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nfinancial sector since 1996 through program loans and technical assistance (TA). Subprogram 2 is \nbuilt on earlier initiatives to help address the continuing need for financial sector development in \nViet Nam. The first Financial Sector Program (1996\u20132002) facilitated the developing of legal and \nregulatory foundations for commercial banking.2 The Second Financial Sector Program (2002\u2013\n2006) promoted the development of the nonbank financial subsector, particularly insurance and \nleasing, and the anti-money laundering regime.3 \n \n3.  The objective of the Third Financial Sector Program4 is to create a more diversified, deeper, \nand  more  resilient  financial  sector.  By  increasing  the  share  of  nonbank  financial  markets  in \nfinancing investment, the program will contribute to enabling sustained growth in the economy with \nreduced  risks  due  to  funding  mismatch.  Greater  scope  and  efficiency  of  alternative  nonbank \nfinancial intermediation channels will strengthen stability of the financial sector through increased \ncompetition. Financial sector reforms aimed at mitigating risks of sector instability help reduce the \nvulnerability of the poor falling into poverty arising from financial sector crisis. This is supported by \nthe recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) study involving 65 developing countries, which found \nthat (i) financial sector development raises economic growth and reduces poverty, (ii) financial \nsector development directly reduces poverty by increasing the investment and interest incomes of \nthe 20% poorest households, and (iii) financial sector instability directly reduces incomes of the \npoor thereby increasing poverty.5 \n \n4.  The program cluster comprises two subprograms covering the period from January 2006 to \nSeptember 2010. The program is in line with Strategy 20206 as well as the government\u2019s Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for 2007\u20132010,7 \nwhich all support business-led pro-poor growth by promoting infrastructure development, creating a \nbusiness-enabling environment, and developing diversified financial intermediation. A total loan of \n$135 million from ADB's Special Funds resources was allotted for the program\u2014$75 million for \nsubprogram 1 and $60 million for subprogram 2. \n \n5.  Subprogram 1. Actions under subprogram 1 were undertaken in two phases from January \n2006 to February 2009. At the request of the government, the implementation period for the \nsecond tranche was extended to 31 December 2009 to allow for additional time to complete the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 1996.

The successful completion of subprogram 1 justifies the program loan to proceed with \nimplementation of subprogram 2.  \n \n6.  Subprogram  2.  Actions  under subprogram  2  cover  the  period  from  March  2009  until \nSeptember  2010.  The  subprogram  focus  is  on  development  of  securities  and  bond  markets; \nincreasing  transparency  disclosure;  and  strengthening  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  enforcement \nframeworks.  It  provides  support  for  government  efforts  to  strengthen  regional  cooperation  by \nenhancing cooperation with regulators in other securities markets in the region. \n \n7.  The focus of priorities under subprogram 2 has been refined since its formulation in 2006 to \nreflect  the  impact  and  lessons  from  the  global  financial  crisis  (2008\u20132009)  and  the  need  to \nemphasize  measures  to  strengthen  financial  stability.  The  refinement  includes  additional  and \nexplicit emphasis on financial stability and human resource development. With these refinements, \nthe program loan now comprises 21 policy actions of which 14 are core actions that have all been \naccomplished. The remaining 7 actions are completed milestones.10 The development policy letter \nis in Appendix 3 and the policy matrix and post-program partnership framework are in Appendix 4.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n8.  Financial sector development in transitional economies is a complex, long-term effort. Over \nthe  past  decade,  the  government  has  embarked  on  financial  sector reform  to  transform  and \nmodernize the country\u2019s financial sector. Through program and TA (footnotes 2-4), ADB  has \nsupported the government in addressing these critical bottlenecks in financial sector infrastructure, \ninstitutional  capacity,  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  ADB  Country  Assistance \nProgram Evaluation for Viet Nam recommended a continuous support for the financial sector.11  \n \n9.  Financial sector reforms require support over the medium to long term. Reforms supported \nunder this and earlier programs have been integral to supporting Viet Nam\u2019s gradual transition from \na centrally planned to a market-based economy and in helping the government achieve and \nsustain high rates of economic growth. This was instrumental in the country's remarkable progress \nwith poverty reduction over the last decade. Viet Nam's recent rapid rate of economic growth has \nbeen underpinned by record investment.12 Investment by the private sector, moreover, has grown \nmuch faster than that by the public sector. Following the acceleration of economic reforms, private \nsector investment has supplanted the public sector as the main contributor to capital accumulation \nduring the program period, accounting for over 60% of total capital accumulation by 2007.13  \n \n                                                 \n8  The first tranche of $30 million was released on 13 June 2008, and the second tranche of $45 million was released in \nDecember 2009. \n9  ADB. 2009.

Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Viet Nam. Manila.  \n12 Increasing from some 35% of GDP in 2001 to a remarkable 45% by 2007. \n13 The same share the public sector held in 2001. \n ", "      3     \n10.  Banks dominate intermediation. While progress in developing the financial sector has \nbeen impressive, banking continues to dominate the sector\u2014in particular state-owned commercial \nbanks, which account for 51% of total aggregate loans. The IMF 2010 Article IV Consultation with \nVietnam concludes that one of the fundamental problems facing Viet Nam is overbanking.14 Overall \nasset  quality  of  the  banking  system  has  not  been  challenged  by  the  financial  crisis  as \nnonperforming  loans  only  accounted  for  2.2%  in  June  2009.  However,  constraints  for  the \ncontinuing intermediation of banking include the limited scale of operations, credit risk, and funding \nmismatches.  By  increasing  the  share  of  nonbank  financial  markets  in  financing  investments, \nsubprogram 2 will continue to enable sustained high economic growth with reduced risks due to \nfunding mismatch.  \n \n11.  Micro-prudential  measures  and  major  legal  reform  for  banking.  In  an  effort  to \nstrengthen  the  financial  stability  of  the  banking  system,  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam  (SBV) \nintroduced a number of key micro-prudential measures and initiated major legal reforms for the \nSBV  Law  and  Credit  Institutions  Law.  To  improve  banking  capitalization,  SBV  identified \nconsolidation  of  private  joint  stock  banks  as a  priority  along  with  equitization of  state-owned \ncommercial banks. It increased the minimum charter capital of joint stock banks to D3 trillion to be \nmet  by  the  end  of  2010.  Other  key  measures  include  a  new  solvency  ratio  and  corporate \ngovernance requirements for banks, the extension of the bankruptcy law to commercial banks, \nformalization  of  SBV  powers  to  place  banks  under  special  control,  and  the  establishment  of \nregulations to govern bank mergers.  \n \n12.  Measured progress in capital markets. The number of publicly listed companies in the \nHo Chi Minh City and Hanoi stock exchanges has increased significantly, from 41 in 2005 to 457 in \n2009, and to 549 as of June 2010. Likewise, initial public offerings of equities averaged 3.25% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) for 2006\u20132009, reaching a peak of 9.14% in 2007. The total market \ncapitalization value of Viet Nam of approximately $39 billion is still small compared with other \ncountries in the region. However, if state-owned enterprise reforms, including their equitization, \nremain on track, the size of the stock market may approach that of the Philippines ($76 billion) and \nThailand ($166 billion). The State Securities Commission (SSC) has taken steps to enhance its \nsupervisory  capacity.  The  country  now  has  105  registered  securities  firms  and  46  fund \nmanagement companies. \n \n13.  However,  continued  efforts  are  needed  to  strengthen  investor  protection,  and  improve \nmarket transparency, corporate governance, and risk management capacity of market institutions. \nSubprogram 2 will support government efforts to limit the scope of unregulated markets for unlisted \nsecurities15 to encourage companies to increase their long-term capital and financing needs in the \nregulated capital markets. \n \n14.  Government debt market. The bond market has been impacted by the global financial \ncrisis. Total outstanding value of government bonds as a percentage of GDP increased from \n2.82% in 2001 to 8.16% in 2005, reaching its peak in 2007 at 10.28% before declining to 9.49% in \n2008 and 8.25% in 2009. The debt market is largely dominated by government obligations. The \nmost significant issue preventing the development of the bond market, other than lack of significant \nparticipants, is the lack of reliable and liquid benchmarks to establish a government yield curve. \nThe government public debt profile is currently skewed toward the short end of the yield curve16 ; \nlonger-term  issuance  needs  to  be  considered  in  establishing  the  needed  benchmarks.  The \n                                                 \n14  IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Vietnam Public Information Notice No. 10/127, 8 \nSeptember 2010. \n15 Private equity markets. \n16 These include those with yields ranging from 3 months to 12 months. \n ", "4   \nestablishment of the Debt Management and External Finance Office (PDMO)17 with the passing of \nthe Public Debt Management Law on 17 June 2009 is expected to significantly help address \nimpediments to consolidating the management of public debt. The government has also embarked \non  a  comprehensive  review  of  Decree  141/2003/ND-CP,  which  governs  the  issuance  of \ngovernment  bonds,  government-guaranteed  bonds,  and  municipal  bonds,  and  Decree \n52/2006/ND-CP, which regulates the issuance of corporate bonds.   \n \n15.  Support for the insurance industry. The development of long-term savings institutions \nsuch as the insurance subsector is critical for mobilizing and allocating long-term savings into \ncapital to further the economic development of the country. The insurance subsector continues to \nexpand  rapidly  with  annual  insurance  premiums  growing  tenfold  over  the  past  10  years,  to \napproximately $1.2 billion. Nevertheless, only about 5% of Viet Nam's population is insured. The \ngovernment  recently  amended  the  Law  on  Insurance  Business  to  provide  greater  investor \nprotection, and the Insurance Supervisory Authority has strengthened its capacity to protect policy \nholders. However, more emphasis needs to be given to capacity building of the insurance regulator \nto enhance the risk-based supervision framework to bring it into alignment with international best \npractice. \n \n16.  Market information and transparency. Viet Nam faces significant challenges in effectively \nadopting international accounting standards (IAS) and auditing standards. Given the complexity of \nthe standards, the government has decided to initiate step-by-step implementation after completing \ncomprehensive and thorough consultation and preparation. Further support is needed for the full \nadoption of IAS and auditing standards, including capacity building.  \n \n17.  Global financial crisis and lessons learned. Progress on some of the indicative policy \nactions developed for subprogram 2 in 2006 has been difficult. First, the global financial crisis \nresulted in a change in the government\u2019s priorities for the financial sector, as was the case for Viet \nNam\u2019s regional peers. For example, total stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP \nreached its peak at 43.26% in 2007 before declining to 15.19% in 2008. Likewise, total outstanding \nvalue of Government bond as a percentage of GDP reached its peak in 2007 at 10.28% of GDP \nbefore declining to 8.25% in 2009. Second, the government is increasingly recognizing the need to \ncreate an institutional basis for its debt management. Third, focus is needed on development of the \nshort end of the government securities market and augmented money markets (footnote 16). To \nsupport the government in meeting its revised priorities, subprogram 2 was refined based on the \nfollowing four key considerations: \n(i)   Shift in priorities. The reformulation recognizes the significant shift in government \npolicy priorities for the financial sector following the global financial crisis\u2014notably \nstrengthened emphasis on key reforms to enhance the transparency, soundness, \nand stability of banking system. \n(ii)  Need to create an institutional basis for debt management. While the global \nfinancial crisis presented unexpected challenges for the development of government \nbond markets, it also led to the recognition that existing arrangements for debt \nissuance pose significant impediments. The government recognizes the need to \ncreate  an  institutional  basis  for  holistic  reforms  of  its  debt  operations  prior  to \nembarking on significant market structure reforms.  \n(iii)  Development  of  the  short  end  of  the  government  securities  market  and \naugmented money markets. The refined program prioritizes the development of \nthe short end of the bond market as part of a sequential approach to bond market \n                                                 \n17 The abbreviation \"PDMO\u201d which is commonly used for Public Debt Management Office is used for the Debt     \nManagement and External Finance Office. \n ", "      5     \ndevelopment.  Subprogram  2  will  support  the  government  in  improving  the  risk \nmanagement  and  operating  efficiency  of  money  markets  and  open  market \noperations of SBV to enhance liquidity in the secondary market. \n(iv)  Lessons from subprogram 2.18 Finance sector reforms in transitional economies \noften  recognize  the  need  for  a  clearly  defined  step-by-step  approach  over  the \nmedium-to-long term as new institutions and concepts need to be introduced and \nrelated capacity built.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The expected impact for the program is a more diversified, deeper, and resilient financial \nsector in Viet Nam. The outcome of the program will be an increased share of capital markets in \nfinancing domestic investment, which will promote and facilitate a sustained high growth rate in the \neconomy with reduced refunding risks.19 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n19.  Subprogram 2 acknowledges the difficult environment faced by Viet Nam in the wake of \nglobal financial crisis during 2008\u20132009, and recognizes significant key measures initiated by SBV \nin 2009\u20132010 to mitigate the impacts of the crisis on the financial sector to ensure financial \nstability. While progress on some of the indicative policy actions developed for subprogram 2 \nduring formulation of subprogram 1 in 2006 was difficult due to the fallout from the global financial \ncrisis, significant progress in related areas has been achieved in response to the crisis to assure \nthe soundness of commercial banks. Additionally, in other policy areas where program progress \nhas fallen behind due to the impacts from the global financial crisis, new institutional approaches, \nsuch  as  the  formation  of  PDMO,  provide  a  basis  for  sounder  and  accelerated  progress  in \nimplementing needed reforms for government debt. Although the direct impact of the crisis on \naccounting is not discernible, the original condition imposed for subprogram 2 on implementation of \nIAS 39 was refined due to market readiness issues for adopting this standard by 2010. Other \nsignificant  progress  includes  major  law  reforms  initiated across  the financial  sector\u2014banking, \nsecurities,  and  insurance;  the  SSC  Strategy  2010\u20132020  for  long-term  capital  markets \ndevelopment; new disclosure requirements; various micro-prudential measures introduced by SBV; \nand related measures to strengthen the supervisory and regulatory regime. \n \n20.  Output  1:  Enhanced  capital  market  liquidity  through  improved  information \ndisclosure. Timely disclosure of material information reduces information asymmetries among \nmarket  participants,  strengthening  investor  confidence  and  supporting  market  liquidity. \nSubprogram 2 supports a new core policy action covering the new regulation issued by MOF \nrequiring information disclosure of listed and unlisted public companies to move closer to the \nadoption  of  international  best  practices.  Under  a  new  core  policy  action,  SSC  completed  a \ncomprehensive analysis of a strategic development and sector road map for 2010\u20132020 to address \nmarket infrastructure bottlenecks for capital market growth. To address accounting standards, the \ngovernment initiated a gap assessment to more closely align Vietnamese accounting standards \nwith the IAS and developed an implementation timeline. \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n19Refunding is the refinancing or restructuring of debt with new debt, equity, or a combination of both. Sometimes \nrefunding involves the issuance of equity in order to decrease the proportion of debt in the borrower's capital structure. \nAs a result of refunding, the maturity of the debt may be extended or reduced. \n \n ", "6   \n21.  To  enhance  market  information  standards,  the  draft  Law  on  Independent  Audit  was \nsubmitted  to  the  government.  To  enhance  information  disclosure,  the  Vietnam  Securities \nDepository (VSD) completed the pilot implementation of the automatic synchronization of records \nbetween its head office and branches for public companies registered with VSD. To strengthen \nVSD\u2019s risk management capacity, a risk assessment of its central depository and clearing functions \nbenchmarked against international practices will be undertaken.20 \n \n22.  Output 2: Strengthened institutional framework for securities issuance. To develop \nthe  government  securities  market,  the  program  supports  institutional  reforms  such  as  the \nestablishment of PDMO. Together with the Banking and Financial Institutions Department of MOF, \nPDMO will provide an institutional focal point to support a range of key reforms in the bond \nmarkets. To improve the risk management and operating efficiency of the money market, and open \nmarket operations for the development of a liquid secondary market, SBV will incorporate the \nshort-term risk mitigation measures identified in the ADB TA report.21   \n \n23.  Output  3:  Enhanced  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  investor  and  consumer \nprotection and financial sector stability. The program supports a review of the legal framework \nfor the Securities Law with a view to strengthening enforcement powers and investor protection. \nSBV, as part of its response to the global financial crisis, introduced measures to strengthen \ncommercial banks including (i) adopting new corporate governance requirements based on the \ncorporate governance principles of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development; \n(ii) increasing the charter capital of banks; and (iii) amending the SBV Law, Credit Institutions Law, \nand application of Bankruptcy Law on credit institutions, including special control by SBV in an \neffort to drive banking consolidation. \n \n24.  As part of its efforts to strengthen its anti-money laundering regime, Viet Nam joined the \nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering and in July 2009 was evaluated by the group. A new core \npolicy action supported under subprogram 2 is the submission of the draft amendments to the \ninsurance law to the government by August 2010 and the issuance of a decree on administrative \npenalties for insurance businesses. \n \n25.  Output 4: Improved regional cooperation and human resource development. One of \nthe conditions stipulated in subprogram 1 is for SSC to assess its ability to meet benchmarks under \nthe  International  Organization  of  Securities  Regulators  (IOSCO)  multilateral  memorandum  of \nunderstanding (MMOU) and to develop a road map for it to become a signatory to Annex B of the \nIOSCO MMOU. Viet Nam has been accepted as an IOSCO MMOU Annex B signatory; this is \nsubject to government approval. The reformulated policy action for subprogram 2 requires MOF to \nsubmit a request to the government to approve Viet Nam\u2019s membership in the MMOU Annex B \nsignatory. Subprogram 2 supports a systematic approach to capacity building for financial sector \ndevelopment. SBV is developing a 5-year human resource development plan to 2015 with a vision \nup to 2020. In line with this move, SBV will conduct a skill gap assessment to formulate a \ncomprehensive capacity-building program.  \n \n26.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  Subprogram  2  includes  a  post-program \npartnership  framework  (PPPF)  with  high-impact  policy  actions22 and  institutional  development \nmeasures building on reforms and core actions under subprogram 2. This is to serve as a platform \n                                                 \n20 This assessment will be undertaken by December 2010. \n21 ADB. 2010.

The overall loan size is \ndetermined  by  the  strength  of  the  associated  policy  actions,  their  development  impact,  the \nimportance  of  the  sectors  covered,  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  government  as \nindicated by MOF, and the government\u2019s financing needs during the country partnership strategy \nperiod. The program will imply some short-term, direct adjustment costs, including costs for (i) \nrestructuring  and  capacity  building  for  SSC,  SBV,  MOF,  and  capital  markets  self-regulatory \norganizations; (ii) operationalizing new institutions including capacity building (e.g., PDMO); (iii) \nenhancing  supervisory  agencies,  and  accounting  and  auditing  agencies;  (iv)  introducing  new \nstandards and legislative reforms; and (v) developing money markets and open market operations, \nand developing bond markets. It is estimated that total short to medium term static gains under \nFSPL III from (i) improvement in banking sector efficiency, (ii) shift financing mix from bank loans to \nbonds, and (iii) reduce corporate default rates to benchmark rates, is at $489 million or 0.6% of \nGDP. A long-term static gain from the reforms is estimated at $4.8 billion or 5.5% of GDP. A total \nestimated adjustment cost from the program is about $56.8 million.23 The loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures \nand Related Requirements for Program Loans.24 The program will provide for the retroactive \nfinancing of eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. ADB will \nretain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the withdrawal \napplication certification. The short-term, direct costs, however, do not incorporate the full direct \ncosts of the policy package, which includes longer-term changes for institutions and processes.25 \nWhile  the  direct  reform  costs  maybe  relatively  modest,  the  program  is  expected  to  leverage \nsubstantial increase in the availability and access to finance through enhanced capital markets \nliquidity and strengthened legal and institutional framework.  \n \n29.  The program loan also reflects the development financing needs of the government. The \npolitical costs of implementing the reforms are considerable, with vested interests benefiting from \nweak enforcement of regulations in financial markets and from the absence of adequate risk \nmanagement, supervision, and transparency. Although the benefits of the reforms will far outweigh \nthe costs, the benefits will materialize over time, while the costs are front loaded. In the absence of \ntimely reforms, the economy will continue to bear the significant costs of inefficient intermediation \nand be exposed to systemic risks, perhaps most importantly currency and maturity mismatches, \n                                                 \n23 The Summary Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides details of the \nmagnitude of the benefits and costs of the program. Total estimated adjustment costs of $56.8 million include \nadministrative, enforcement, fiscal and business compliance costs. \n24 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n25 The government accounting systems do not currently allow the segregation of the actual or future incremental costs \nattributable to implementation of the Third Financial Sector Program, subprogram 2.  \n ", "8   \nand investors will be left vulnerable to misconduct and fraud. The government has demonstrated \nits strong commitment to financial sector reforms by initiating a number of core policy initiatives to \nsafeguard stability of the financial system and to develop capital markets as reflected in the \nrefinement of subprogram 2 program outputs.  \n \n30.  Accounting, auditing, and reporting to ADB. SBV, as the executing agency, is required \nto submit a final report on the progress of the entire program cluster. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n31.  SBV is the executing agency for subprogram 2. MOF in coordination with the SSC, and its \nagencies  (the  Hanoi  Stock  Exchange,  and  VSD)  are  the  implementing  agencies.  SBV  is \nresponsible for overall program implementation and administration, disbursement of loan proceeds, \nand monitoring.  \n \n32.  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  different  government  ministries  and \nagencies concerned, a program steering committee was formed, chaired by SBV and comprising \nsenior officers from all government agencies concerned. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Fiduciary Assessment \n33.  The government\u2019s public financial management reforms are at an early stage but steady \nprogress is being made in improving the legislative and institutional framework. The National \nAssembly promulgated the Law on Public Debt Management in June 2009. The law provides a \nlegal framework for a modern debt management system to monitor public debt, analyze its profile, \nand resolve and manage related fiscal risks.  \n \n34.  Implementation of the 2002 Budget Law is progressing. Budget coverage in Viet Nam is \nreasonably comprehensive, but still incomplete compared to international practices. The State \nBudget  Law  needs  to  be  updated.  The  Government  has  piloted  a  medium-term  expenditure \nframework in several sectors, but it needs to be scaled up and mainstreamed in the annual budget \ncycle. The World Bank\u2019s assessment suggests that the fiduciary risks of the current public financial \nmanagement systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting and auditing) are moderate.26 \n \n35.  A  new  integrated  computerized  financial  management  system  (Treasury  and  Budget \nManagement Information System) was rolled out in 2008 to strengthen expenditure management \nand control. A road map for adoption of international public sector accounting standards was \napproved to provide the basis for preparing government financial statements that are more in line \nwith international practices.  \n \n36.  The  government  is  also  developing  the  building  blocks  for  improved  governance  and \nanticorruption measures. Since 2005, implementation of the State Audit Law and reporting of the \nsummaries of annual audit reports by the State Audit of Vietnam have strengthened the process of \nexternal oversight. Under the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Support Operations and ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n26 World Bank. 2009.

Governance and anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained and discussed with the Government of Viet Nam and the executing agency. The \ngovernment is taking an active approach against corruption, and recently adopted several legal \nchanges, including the Anti-Corruption Law. Results of investigations against corruption overseen \nby the government inspectorate have been disclosed, and a legal framework established to protect \nand reward people who speak out against corruption.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Impact Assessment \n38.  The financial sector plays a central role in the mobilization and allocation of resources in a \nmodern market-based economy. Reforms supported under this and earlier programs have been \nintegral to supporting Viet Nam's gradual transition to a market-based economy and to helping the \ngovernment achieves and sustains high rates of economic growth. These, in turn, have been \ninstrumental in the country's remarkable progress in poverty reduction over the last decade. The \noverall poverty rate dropped from 58% in 1993 to about 14.8% in 2008. According to government \nprojections, the current poverty rate is below 10%. The impressive reduction in poverty is largely \nattributable to sustained business-led growth in investment, output, and employment that have \nbeen made possible partly by the financial sector reform programs. The private sector has created \nmost of the new jobs in the last decade. The majority of private sector investment has come from \ndomestic enterprises. The program's focus underscores the priority placed by the government in its \nnational socioeconomic development plans and sector strategies on financial sector development.  \n \nC.  Safeguards \n39.  The  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  rated  as  category  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  Subprogram 2 assumes political stability in the country and continued adoption of sound \nmacroeconomic policies by the government. Given the track record of Viet Nam, both these \nassumptions are sound and defensible. Nonetheless, implementation of subprogram 2 is still \nsubject to the risks described in the following table.  \n \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nExogenous, international  The government is undertaking measures to strengthen its monetary policy framework, \nfinancial shock, and  expand the tax base, and strengthen public expenditure management, with the \nmacroeconomic instability  assistance of development partners including ADB.  \nPolitical resistance and vested  The government has shown strong commitment to the reform agenda.

ASSURANCES \n41.  The government and SBV have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe loan agreement. In addition to the continued compliance and implementation of the actions \nspecified in the policy matrix and the standard assurances, the government has given the following \nspecific assurances: \n \n(i)  The government will ensure sustainability of the reform policies adopted and actions \ntaken before the date of the loan agreement and described in the development \npolicy letter (including the policy matrix). \n(ii)  The government will keep ADB informed of, and the government and ADB will from \ntime  to  time  exchange  views  on,  sector  issues,  policy  reforms,  and  additional \nfinancial sector reforms that may be necessary or desirable, including progress \nmade in carrying out policies and actions set out in the development policy letter, \nthe PPPF, and related TA projects. \n(iii)  The government will ensure that the counterpart funds will be used to support \nfinancial sector reforms to meet the financing costs associated with the program and \nthe PPPF. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies \nequivalent to SDR38,271,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Third \nFinancial Sector Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n5 November 2010\n ", "                                                                                                                        Appendix 1       11     \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  Increase in the M2-GDP  Reports and websites of  Assumptions \nA deeper, more diversified,  ratio by about 8 percentage  SBV and MOF   Political stability \nand resilient financial  points by the end of 2013     \nsector  (82% in 2005)    Sound macroeconomic policies \n     \nIncrease in share of non  Websites and statistics  Risk \nbank financial sector assets  published by MOF and SBV   External environment deteriorates, \nto total financial sector    increasing stress on fiscal policy \nassets from 15% in 2005,   \n16% in 2009 to about 20%   \n- 25% in 2013   \n   \nMaintain average solvency  Website and report from \nratio for banks above the  SBV \n8% minimum capital   \nadequacy ratio by 2013 \nOutcome  Increase in number of listed  Reports and statistics  Assumptions \nIncreased share of capital  companies from 44 in 2005  published by SSC, MOF and  Effective coordination among \nmarkets in financing  to about 700 by 2011  the Stock Exchanges   relevant government agencies \ndomestic investment       \nIncrease in total value of  SBV, MOF, and SSC reports  Improved economic growth \nGovernment bond     \noutstanding from 10% of    Risks \nGDP in 2005 to about 20%    Regional or global financial shocks \nof GDP in 2011    may impact Viet Nam\u2019s capital \n    markets and affect investor \nIncrease in market  Websites and reports from  confidence \ncapitalization in combined  SSC and Stock Exchanges   \nHNX and HSX from 1.11%  Slow down in global economic \nof GDP in 2005 to about  growth \n30% in 2011 \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
