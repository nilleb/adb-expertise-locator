THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency Program, and \n(ii) a proposed policy-based loan to the Republic of Azerbaijan for subprogram 1 of the Improving \nGovernance and Public Sector Efficiency Program. \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  aims  to  strengthen  governance  in  the  public  sector  and \ndiversification of the economy by enabling enhanced private sector participation through better \naccess to finance and the business environment. The program will introduce rules-based fiscal \nplanning in the government\u2019s budget system, improve legal and institutional structures governing \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), and help improve the business environment and access to \nfinance  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  The  programmatic  approach  will \ncomprise two subprograms implemented during 2017\u20132018. Approved transaction technical \nassistance is assisting with the implementation of the program.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic context. After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan registered rapid \neconomic  growth  averaging  11.0%  during  1995\u20132013.  The  growth  was  largely  fueled  by \nhydrocarbon activity, which contributed to 90% of the country\u2019s exports and around 75% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and government income. The crash in the global oil prices from a high \nof $110 per barrel in 2014 to $50 in 2015 caused a major setback to the economy leading to a \nsignificant fall in revenues contracting public investments and tightening domestic demand. As a \nresult, the fiscal balance of the central government budget shifted from a surplus of 2.9% of GDP \nin 2014 to a deficit of 4.8% in 2015. In 2016 the central government budget was balanced; \nhowever,  without  transfers  from  State  Oil  Fund  of  Azerbaijan  (SOFAZ),  the  budget  deficit \namounted to 13.4% of GDP.2 Decline in oil export revenues also led to a negative current account \nbalance. With this backdrop of falling oil prices, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan devalued the \nmanat twice in 2015. On 12 October 2017, the value of the manat in United States dollars \nrepresented only 46% of its 2014 year-end value. Since the government has a high proportion of \ndebt denominated in foreign currency, the devaluation deteriorated the country\u2019s external debt \nposition, exacerbating inflationary pressures because of a high exchange rate pass-through effect \nand also created a shortage of credit to the private sector, especially in local currency. The \naverage inflation rate rose from 4.0% in 2015 to 12.4% in 2016. These factors culminated in a \nnegative growth rate of the economy of \u20133.1% in 2016 compared to 2.8% in 2014.  \n \n4.  Development problem. The twin development of economic growth and social indicators \nhas been a key feature of the Azerbaijan growth story since the 2000s. However, the traditional \nheavy dependence of the economy on hydrocarbons exposed the country to macroeconomic \nshocks while limiting the development of the non-oil sector. Excessive reliance on hydrocarbons \ncontributed to appreciation of the real exchange rate of the manat during the oil boom era, thereby \nundercutting the international competitiveness of the nonresource sector and negatively affecting \nthe export of nonresource goods. This is the core development problem in Azerbaijan, manifested \n                                                \n1  The program is included in ADB. 2017.

This technical assistance is supporting the implementation of the \nprogram.  \n2  Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan.  ", "2 \nthree-dimensionally along fiscal management, public sector management, and nondiversified \neconomic  development  paradigms.  Supported  by  stakeholder  consultations  and  diagnostic \nstudies, the core issues faced by Azerbaijan are distilled in paras 5-9. \n \n5.  Challenges in fiscal and public debt management. On the fiscal side, Azerbaijan is \nexperiencing a procyclical budget\u2014a characteristic of a resource-rich country. Until 2014, the \ngovernment expenditure increased significantly; however, the decline in oil revenue was not \nfollowed by a commensurate reduction in expenditure, leading to a large fiscal deficit after 2014. \nThe  current  government  budgetary  procedures  need  to  be  streamlined  to  prevent  ad  hoc \nspending decisions that result in inefficient allocation of resources not linked to sector priorities \nand lack focus on long-term, non-oil sustainability. The fiscal policy framework lacks a clearly \nelaborated and well-established rule to guide the use of oil revenues to finance public spending.3 \nThe current system is closely linked to oil prices and is deficient on long-term measures on \nreducing the dependence on oil. A significant burden adding to the state budget outlays is \nfinancing the pension fund deficit through transfers from the state budget. The transfers to the \nState Social Protection Fund amounted to $781 million in 2016, down from $1.07 billion in 2015. \nThis, coupled with increased debt servicing obligations on foreign-currency-denominated debt, \nhas contracted the available fiscal space. Some key reforms are needed to reduce the burden of \nsocial expenditure (such as pensions) and debt servicing on the state budget. These reforms will \nhelp increase the available fiscal space and reprioritize expenditure allocations to productive \nsectors. \n \n6.  Because of manat depreciation and increase in the fiscal deficit stemming from the fall in \noil revenues and absence of fiscal consolidation, the stock of public debt has grown substantially. \nThe nominal gross debt as a share of GDP increased from 11% in 2014 to 28% in 2015 and \nfurther to 38% in 2016. Since over 70% of Azerbaijan's public debt is denominated in foreign \ncurrencies, debt sustainability needs to be closely monitored. Future borrowings, exchange rate \nvolatility, and debt of SOEs may put added pressure on debt ratios. The public debt management \nsystem in Azerbaijan lacks a medium-term strategic framework or a standardized information \ntechnology platform for recording debt transactions. This leads to challenges such as lack of \ncoordination between the cash management system and debt management system of the \ngovernment, manual collection and reporting of debt indicators, and inadequate dissemination of \ninformation on debt, giving rise to issues of transparency and data integrity.  \n \n7.  Challenges in the business environment. Challenges in the business environment \ninclude  lack  of  economic  diversification,  inadequate  development  of  the  private  sector, \ninefficiencies in SOEs, decline in banking system solvency, and limited access to finance for \nbusinesses. A primary way to reduce dependency on oil revenues is to diversify the economy, \nwhich in turn hinges upon development of a vibrant, non-oil private sector. The economic activities \nare being primarily led by the public sector with very limited role for the private sector. Though \nAzerbaijan was a leader in terms of growth up until 2014 among the Caucasus and Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation countries, it lags behind most countries in the region in terms of \nease of doing business. Azerbaijan was ranked 65th among 190 countries in 2017 and is one of \nthe lowest ranked countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States.4 Access to finance has \nbeen one of the major factors leading to constrained growth of the private sector, especially for \nSMEs. Data from the 2017\u20132018 Global Competitive Index ranks Azerbaijan low in terms of ease \n                                                \n3  A fiscal rule is a framework comprising macroeconomic and budget parameters for implementation of budget policy \nwhich ensures medium- and long-term macroeconomic stability and financial and debt disciplines. \n4  World Bank. 2017. Doing Business 2017: Equal Opportunity for All. Economy Profile 2017: Azerbaijan. Washington, \nDC. \n ", "3 \nof access to finance among the major regional countries.5 The promotion of SMEs is a major \ncomponent of private sector development. However, the sector has not seen much growth \nbecause of a variety of issues such as regulatory bottlenecks, an unfriendly tax environment, \nnonavailability of affordable finance, a weak entrepreneur base, and limited access to finance.6 \nThis in turn has also inhibited the growth of non-oil exports. As a measure to improve access to \nfinance for enterprises, the National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support (NFES) was constituted \nunder the Ministry of Economy. Authorized lending institutions, including banks and nonbank \nfinancial institutions, can issue loans on preferential terms according to the criteria framed by the \nsupervisory board of the NFES for financing investment projects that are in the priority areas for \nsocioeconomic  development  of  Azerbaijan.  However,  the  recent  economic  recession  has \nadversely affected the performance of the fund, resulting in a decline in the number of enterprises \nthat are supported by the fund and consequently reducing the employment generated.  \n \n8.  A significant portion of the economic activities within the country is generated by 14 largest \nSOEs playing a key role in all important sectors of the economy. The SOEs are active in the oil \nand gas, power generation, water supply, railway, air passenger, and cargo areas. For example, \nState Oil Company of Azerbaijan, along with consortium of international oil companies is engaged \nin hydrocarbon extraction that contributes 50% of the country\u2019s GDP and over 90% of its exports. \nMany SOEs, however, receive budget subsidies and are saddled with inefficiencies, and many \nare incurring losses. They face binding issues relating to ownership, management, transparency, \naccountability, financial sustainability, and societal value creation. Corporate governance is \nanother area of concern which has affected the performance and image of SOEs in Azerbaijan. \nAlthough the presidential decree of October 2016 recommends improving the efficiency of SOEs, \na well-designed corporate governance rules framework is yet to be put in place. \n \n9.  The banking system came under severe stress in the aftermath of the economic downturn \nin Azerbaijan as 11 banks lost their license in 2016. This led to a loss of public confidence in the \nbanking subsector. The share of deposits in domestic currency in the total deposits of the banks \nsharply declined from 50.1% in 2014 to 24.7% in 2016.7 The Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund \n(ADIF) was established to insure people\u2019s deposits and maintain confidence in the banking \nsystem. The ADIF disbursed $90 million in 2015 and $348 million in 2016 as compensation to \ndepositors for failing banks. However, such heavy disbursements have depleted the asset base \nof the ADIF, and this needs to be replenished for the fund to continue providing depositor \ncompensation. Considering that the ADIF is already under severe financial strain, it is important \nthat the premiums are priced properly. The 2017 amendments to the Law of the Republic of \nAzerbaijan on Banks clarify the role of the ADIF in liquidation of banks. However, there is a need \nto institute risk-based pricing of deposit insurance premiums for banks and build in safeguards for \nmoral hazards. As mentioned earlier, access to finance is one of the key inhibiting factors limiting \nthe growth of the private business sector in Azerbaijan. Suitable credit enhancement instruments \nfor providing financial assistance to businesses can improve availability of finance for the private \nsector. The weakening of the banking subsector because of high dollarization of deposits has \nalso led to limited availability of credit to the private sector.   \n \n10.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. To ensure sustainable growth, the government is looking \nat ways to diversify the economy while consolidating budgetary expenditure and boosting non-oil \n                                                \n5  World Economic Forum. 2017.

The  priority  structural  reforms  contained  in  the  Strategic  Roadmap  of  National \nEconomy include strengthening public institutions, facilitating access to finance, and efficient \npublic financial management.8 The series of reform initiatives include fiscal measures such as \nenforcing a stricter fiscal rule on the use of oil revenues and the development of medium-term \nexpenditure frameworks (MTEFs) for key spending ministries. The rule will help to ensure \nintergenerational equity, reduce procyclicality, and achieve fiscal consolidation given shrinking \nfiscal space. The government has also embarked on structural reforms addressing the financial \nmanagement issues and institutional inefficiencies in SOEs. It has also instituted measures to \nstreamline the existing processes for improving indicators on the ease of doing business. To \nstrengthen the banking subsector, the government is increasing the capital base of the ADIF and \nremoving bottlenecks for resolution of insolvent banks. The government is setting up a credit \nguarantee fund to ease the access to credit by SMEs with reduced collateral. The proposed \nprogram will bolster private non-oil economic activity, increase fiscal space, and help Azerbaijan\u2019s \ntransition to a diversified economy.9   \n \n11.  Programmatic approach. The structural reforms require a long-term time horizon to \nimplement and attain the intended outcomes effectively. For example, introduction of an MTEF \nrequires sufficient preparatory and implementation time. A programmatic approach facilitates \nchronological sequencing of reforms across a multiyear time horizon through explicit framing of \nrequired policy actions and objectives. The proposed modality also plays a leveraging and \ncatalyzing role in coordinating technical assistance provided by development partners. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  is  coordinating  closely  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  in \nidentifying and sequencing the policy actions.     \n \n12.  Development  partner  coordination.  Development  partners  in  Azerbaijan  have \ninvestment projects mainly in transport, energy, water supply, and the finance sector. The World \nBank  supports  strengthening  the  business  environment,  and  facilitates  agriculture  lending \ncapacity. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting the private \nsector through equity investments in financial institutions, direct lending, financial intermediation, \nand capacity building in business administration. Funded by the Swiss Cooperation Agency, the \nInternational Finance Corporation also supports financial institutions via investments and advisory \nservices.  The  European  Union  provides  technical  advice  in  the  areas  of  public  financial \nmanagement and governance. The World Bank will also provide technical assistance on some \npublic financial management areas in 2018. The International Monetary Fund provides technical \nsupport on development of new fiscal rules and advises government on macroeconomic policy \nand the exchange rate regime. Under this program, the ADB is complementing implementation of \na fiscal rule being developed by the International Monetary Fund and is consolidating the medium-\nterm horizon of budget planning conceptualized by the World Bank.  \n \n13.  Lessons. The program takes into account lessons from ADB\u2019s programmatic engagement \nin many other developing member countries in the areas of public financial management, financial \nsector development, and SOE reforms, and lessons from the recent and specific policy dialogue \nin the Azerbaijan context. The policy dialogue has highlighted the importance of supporting the \nplanned or initiated reform processes with technical assistance, which is instrumental in building \na strong base for the reforms to move to the next level. Policy reforms must be accompanied by \nstrong government ownership, which is demonstrated by the government\u2019s clear reform priorities \nand willingness to engage in a multiyear programmatic engagement framework with ADB. In \n                                                \n8  Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on approval of the Roadmap on National Economy and Main \nSectors of the Economy dated 9 December 2016. \n9  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Azerbaijan, 2014\u20132018. Manila \n ", "5 \naddition, setting realistic policy actions is critical to ensuring that the reform program can be \ncarried  out  effectively  while  building  simultaneous  capacities.  International  lessons  for  the \nsuccessful  development  of  public financial  management, financially  sustainable  SOEs,  and \nfinance sector development emphasize several crucial factors: (i) sound sequencing and realism \nin reform objectives; (ii) clear connection to local circumstances; and (iii) sound, modern, reliable, \nand efficient institutional infrastructure. The program incorporates these lessons.  \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition. In 2016, ADB provided a short-term countercyclical support facility \nto  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  the  economic  recession.  As  highlighted  in  the  facility\u2019s \ndevelopment policy letter, the government also sought ADB\u2019s assistance to support structural \nreforms in the medium term related to macroeconomic and fiscal management, improving public \nsector efficiency and accountability, and promoting SME development.10 ADB adds significant \nvalue to the programmatic approach by (i) identifying critical policy actions based on preparatory \nworks carried out during the preparation of the facility; (ii) improving the targeting of reform-related \nexpenditures and their partial financing; (iii) enhancing coordination with development partners in \nthe design and execution of the programmatic approach; (iv) providing technical assistance to \nsustain the reform initiatives, especially in the areas related to rule-based budgeting, corporate \ngovernance  improvements  in  SOEs,  and  implementing  international  financial  reporting \nstandards;11 and (v) consolidating policy reforms in the finance sector. ADB also gives a strong \nimpetus to the government\u2019s ongoing debt management reforms by providing affordable least-\ncost solutions critical to sustaining these reform initiatives. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The program impact will be sustainable and broad-based economic growth facilitated. The \noutcome will be allocative efficiency of public and private resources improved. Subprogram 1 has \n17 policy actions and subprogram 2 has 22 policy actions.  All subprogram 1 policy actions have \nbeen completed. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Rule-based fiscal planning introduced. The objective of this output is to \npromote discipline in fiscal policy making over the medium-term horizon to put Azerbaijan on a \npath of fiscal consolidation. This will be achieved by improving multiyear budget formulation and \nforecasting,  increasing  fiscal  space  by  rationalizing  public  expenditures,  and  improving \nmanagement  of  public  debt  and  fiscal  risks.  Anchoring  consolidation  in  credible  multiyear \nframeworks is instrumental to maintaining macroeconomic stability and ultimately achieving \nsustainable and inclusive growth. Under the program, the government has formulated fiscal rules \nto serve as the basis of the national budget formulation. An important advantage of a rule-based \nfiscal framework is greater focus on medium-term budgetary forecasts, which in turn ensures \nbetter targeting of sector priorities. The government has initiated preparation of an MTEF on a \npilot basis for one large-spending ministry, which will then be scaled up. The MTEFs play an \nimportant role in improving budget and expenditure management processes for better utilization \nand prioritization of existing fiscal resources in line with government priorities. The MTEFs for the \nline  departments,  in  conjunction  with  a  top-down,  medium-term  fiscal  framework,  are  a \nprerequisite for effective implementation of expenditure rationalization. \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2016.

Several  laws  have  been  amended  under  subprogram  1  to  improve  public  financial \nmanagement. The amended law on labor pensions will reduce the quantum of deficit financing \nrequired for meeting pension fund liabilities, as the government currently allocates a significant \namount from the state budget to meet the deficit in the pension fund every year. This in turn will \ncreate the fiscal room to prioritize the expenditure allocations to productive sectors. Other legal \nand policy interventions have been undertaken with the aim of streamlining and restructuring (i) \nmanagement of the State Guarantee Fund, (ii) borrowings by SOEs, and (iii) management of \nsingle treasury account residual funds. Subprogram 1 has also prepared a medium-term debt \nmanagement strategy including an information-technology-based debt management system to \nmanage debt at a sustainable level. This will provide a key element of a rule-based fiscal \nframework by having ceilings on fiscal deficit, debt, and the interest service obligations on debts. \nTo  implement  the  debt  management  strategy,  the  government  will  undertake  institutional \nreorganization of the Public Debt Management Agency and has deliberated on the design of a \ndebt management system for improving recording and dissemination of information on debt, and \nfinalized the same.   \n \n18.  Output 2. State-owned enterprises restructured and private sector participation in \neconomic  activities  strengthened.  Financially  sustainable  and  effective  SOEs  are  critical \nprerequisites  for  improved  public  service  delivery  and  reduced  fiscal  transfers  from  the \ngovernment budget. The actions under this output aim to strengthen corporate governance of \nSOEs, standardize financial practices, and allow space for private sector participation in economic \nactivities. Under subprogram 1, the government has formulated an action plan to improve the \ntransparency and financial reporting practices of SOEs. The action plan outlines the activities to \nbe undertaken and underpins the role of various agencies responsible for implementing the action \nplan, along with specific time frames required for undertaking each activity. A commission has \nalso been constituted which will closely monitor and report to the government the financial \nperformance of the SOEs, especially in the areas of financial planning and utilization of funds. To \nensure  greater  adherence  to  international  practices  in  the  functioning  of  the  SOEs,  the \ngovernment has drafted comprehensive corporate governance rules that will guide the selection \nof  directors,  internal  audit,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  procedures  for  all  SOEs. \nAdditionally, the government is amending the existing accounting laws to strengthen accounting \npractices in SOEs by mandating implementation of international financial reporting standards. To \ndiversify the economy of Azerbaijan and reduce the dependence on oil, the government has \nformulated and approved strategic plans for the national economy and the key sectors. These \nplans articulate the key goals and actions to achieve those goals over short-, medium-, and long-\nterm horizons. The policy actions under subprogram 1 also facilitate formulation of guidelines for \npublic\u2013private partnerships to improve transparency and address limitations of public financial \nresources in strengthening economic activities and creating new jobs. \n \n19.  Output 3. Enhanced access to finance and business environment improved. The \ninterventions under this output aim to diversify the economy and reduce reliance on oil exports \nthrough enhanced participation of the private sector in economic activities by increasing access \nto finance and improving the business environment for the private sector. Improving access to \nfinance, especially for SMEs in local currency, is the key to achieving the broader objective of \ndiversification of the economy. Under subprogram 1, the government has prepared a detailed \naction plan highlighting key intervention areas for improving the overall business environment in \nthe country. Based on the action plan, as a credit enhancement measure the government has set \nup a credit guarantee fund for SMEs with measures to manage risks related to moral hazards \ngenerally associated with the operation of credit guarantee funds (e.g., setting up a seven- \nmember supervisory board with nongovernment participation and working groups made up of \n ", "7 \neminent persons from the public and private sectors). Credit bureaus play a vital role in reducing \nthe risk in the financial sector by maintaining a repository of borrowers and their risk profiles based \non their credit history. Under the program the government has passed the enabling legislation \nthat will help to establish the legal framework for setting up a credit bureau and defining its \nactivities.  \n \n20.  Based on the action plan to improve the ranking in the ease of doing business indicators, \nthe government is implementing reforms based on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business \nparameters. Because of the recent downturn in Azerbaijan and the fact that banks are struggling \nto honor deposits of customers, confidence in the banking system has been seriously shaken. \nThe ADIF has restored the situation to a degree by compensating depositors. Keeping the ADIF \nin a financially sound position is critical to ensuring public confidence in the banking subsector. \nThe policy actions under subprogram 1 will strengthen deposit insurance by recapitalizing the \nADIF\u2019s depleting asset base and developing a model for a risk-based pricing methodology to price \npremiums to be charged from banks. This framework will keep the ADIF operationally sustainable \nand in turn provide impetus to local currency deposits in banks. The increased liquidity in the \nbanking system will lead to enhanced credit availability for SMEs. As a supporting measure, the \nNFES has been providing subsidized credit to entrepreneurs through extension of low-cost loans \nto authorized financial institutions for onlending to entrepreneurs, and capping the spread that \ncan be charged by the authorized lending institutions from the borrowers. There has been \nsignificant economic activity and jobs generated through the NFES intervention. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n21.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  policy-based  lending  under  a \nprogrammatic approach in order to support its continuing structural reform agenda. The overall \nprogram is $500 million, and it will comprise two subprograms. The government has requested a \nregular loan of $250 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. \nSubprogram 2 is also expected to be $250 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n  \n22.  The amount of the loan reflects the government\u2019s development financing needs and the \nstrength and development impact of the proposed policy reforms over the two subprograms. \nBased on detailed discussions with the government officials, the following costs of reforms under \nthe overall program were identified: (i) support the ADIF for meeting the obligations of banks \ntoward depositors, (ii) support the NFES to help in SME development, and (iii) make the Credit \nGuarantee Fund operational. The subprogram 1 loan will be disbursed in a single tranche and the \nclosing date will be 31 March 2018. The loan size is justified considering the key development \nexpenditures during the program period (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Key Reform Costs (2017\u20132018)  \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nOne-time budgetary support to ADIF  320.0 \nBudgetary support to NFES over 2017 and 2018  180.0 \nBudgetary support for operationalization of Credit Guarantee Fund  200.0 \nTotal  700.0 \nADIF = Azerbaijan Deposit Insurance Fund, NFES = National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n ", "8 \n \n23.  Table 2 summarizes the total financing requirements if the official repayment of foreign \ncurrency debt principals is included. The estimated 2017 deficit is $1.2 billion. The proposed loan \nwill help the government partly cover these financing needs while targeting specific reform \nexpenditure items. Given the rigidity in nondiscretionary recurrent expenditures (salary, pensions, \nand interest payments), the impact of a hard budget constraint on development financing has \nbeen found to be negative. It will be difficult for the government to incur additional costs to carry \nout critical reforms unless these are partly financed by the government\u2019s development partners. \nThis is for two reasons: Firstly, there is continued significance of oil transfers in maintaining fiscal \nsustainability, as transfers from SOFAZ continue to be above 40% of state budget revenues since \n2009. Given that a sharp increase in oil prices in the near future appears improbable, transfers to \nsupport the state budget are not expected to jump substantially. Secondly, the fiscal consolidation \nin the medium term can be achieved largely through spending cuts with a strong focus on the \nquality of public spending. Given the distress which the economy is currently in, delays in \ngovernment spending on some of these crucial reforms could be counterproductive from a longer \nterm macroeconomic perspective.  \n \nTable 2: Fiscal Financing Needs  \n($ billion) \nItem  2016  2017p  2018f  2019f \nCentral government overall deficit  0.142  0.790  1.067  1.030 \nDebt repaymenta  0.394  0.449  0.514  0.537 \nTotal financing needed  0.536  1.239  1.581  1.567 \na Official repayments of foreign currency debt principal. \np= provisional, f=forecast \nSource: Official figures for 2016, and Asian Development Bank staff estimates for 2017\u20132019, using different sources. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the executing agency. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan, \nFinancial  Market  Supervisory  Authority,  Ministry  of  Economy,  and  MOF  are  implementing \nagencies. Both the MOF and Central Bank of Azerbaijan have a well-established track record in \nimplementing reform programs with ADB, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. \nThe  implementation  period  for  subprogram  1  is  October  2016  to  November  2017.  The \nimplementation period for subprogram 2 is expected to be December 2017 to December 2018. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The beneficiaries of subprogram 1 are the citizens of Azerbaijan, who will directly benefit \nfrom improved delivery of services and enhanced employment opportunities. The proposed \nprogram will have a favorable impact on growth and job creation, both directly and indirectly. The \nintroduction  of  rule-based  fiscal  planning  under  subprogram  1  facilitates  targeted  public \ninvestments in social and economic infrastructure, which in turn will result in improved health and \neducation  services  and  economic  opportunities.  Moreover,  additional public  investment  will \nstimulate private sector investment and productive activities. SOE reforms under subprogram 1 \nwill also have a beneficial effect on national finances. This will originate primarily from three \nsources: nondebt capital receipts (disinvestment income), reduced fiscal transfers, and higher \n ", "9 \ndividend income. In addition, the government will reduce its contingent liabilities once pensions \nand related retirement liabilities are allocated and funded more efficiently and transparently.12 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  The government placed combating corruption high on its agenda in 2011, announcing a \nno-tolerance  policy.  Efforts  to  combat  corruption  since  2005  had  resulted  in  important \nimprovements, which were acknowledged by regional anticorruption bodies by 2012,13 and \nAzerbaijan  continued  to  make  progress  in  preventing  corruption  in  several  sectors.14 This \ncontributed to marked improvements in public perceptions of governance. The findings of a survey \nundertaken by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development across several transition \neconomies in 2016 show a positive public perception; 59% of respondents think that there was \nless corruption in 2016 than in the 4 years before the survey.15 Initiatives such as the National \nAction Plan for 2016\u20132018 on the Promotion of Open Government paved the way for measures \nlike ASAN Xidmet.16 While punitive actions against certain senior officials suggest that the \ngovernment wants to signal a tough approach on corruption, such efforts need to be sustained. A \ndesk review of potential risks and vulnerabilities in the public financial management systems was \nalso undertaken. The review identified vulnerabilities that could impact the program. While budget \ncomprehensiveness and transparency as well as predictability and control in budget execution \nhave improved in recent years in Azerbaijan, weaknesses remain in external and internal audit. \nThis is especially the case in line ministries, and has been taken up in the public financial \nmanagement action plan adopted by the MOF. The new law on public procurement is expected \nto facilitate the required changes in the public procurement system for more transparent and \nefficient processes. While improvement of fiscal management is a key reform under the attached \ntechnical assistance, development of the integrated financial system is envisaged in subprogram \n2  to  help  expenditure  tracking.  There  is  also  an  increasing  focus  on  implementation  of \ninternational financial reporting standards in SOEs to improve transparency and accountability. \n \n27.  The Government of Azerbaijan has made important progress in strengthening country \nsystems for transparency and accountability in the extractive industries. Following the withdrawal \nof Azerbaijan from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in March 2017, the president \nissued a decree in April 2017 that resulted in the establishment of the high-level Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Commission, with SOFAZ managing its secretariat. The committee \nassumed its activities in April 2017 and agreed on a stakeholder engagement process that also \ninvolves civil society organizations in extractive industry transparency-related tasks such as \ncommenting on transparency reports. ADB\u2019s planned support for beneficial ownership plan \nimplementation will help sustain this progress and the momentum generated by the leadership of \nSOFAZ on extractive industry transparency. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n \n                                                \n12 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 As part of technical assistance support, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the implementation \nguidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, and this was published in 2012. \n14 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2016.

The State Agency for Public Service and \nSocial Innovations reports 98% user satisfaction. In May 2016, the State Customs Committee launched a pilot project \nfor electronic declaration of goods and transport aimed at streamlining procedures and improving transparency. \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Azerbaijan\u2019s poverty ratio was low at 4.9% in 2015. However, recent recession has \nadversely affected Azerbaijan\u2019s labor market with many layoffs in both the public and private \nsectors. The number of unemployed rose by 2.5% in 2015 and 14.5% in 2016, after falling by an \naverage of 2.0% annually during 2010\u20132014. The impact of the ongoing recession on the poverty \nratio is expected to be negative, albeit in the short term. The proposed program aims to improve \nlong-term financing in local currency to SMEs, enhance fiscal space to better respond to external \nshocks that affect employment, and improve the efficiency of public sector resource allocation to \nimprove service delivery. These initiatives are expected to have a direct impact on employment \ncreation and poverty reduction. The promotion and protection of gender equality is one of the nine \nstrategic goals of the government\u2019s poverty reduction and development program, and gender \nissues are prioritized in education, health, the labor market, and in programs for internally \ndisplaced persons and the refugee population. Addressing poverty- and gender-specific problems \nbecomes more challenging, especially in a situation where government is unable to provide \nadequate funds for investment in economic and social infrastructure. The program\u2019s special \nemphasis on better expenditure targeting with the help of MTEFs, especially in health and \neducation, is geared toward protecting poor people and vulnerable groups.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The major risks to the program are discussed in the risk assessment and management \nplan, together with mitigation factors and measures. Table 3 presents the risks that are either \nsubstantial or high (premitigation levels), and that are, to an important extent, out of control of the \nprogram. The overall assessment for the risk level of the program is moderate (premitigation \nlevels). Fiduciary arrangements for budget support are acceptable, and the strengthening of \npublic financial management is one of the key objectives of the program. While no significant risks \nof mismanagement of resources at the executing level are expected, relevant issues identified in \nthe assessments are also targeted in the proposed loan and the ongoing technical assistance. \nThis will provide, by default, close levels of engagement and monitoring that provide at this stage \nan important degree of fiduciary comfort.17  \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk Description  Rating  Mitigation Measures  Responsibility \nReform Sustainability \nLeadership and  S  Government of Azerbaijan has been announcing and  MOF and ADB \npolitical will to  implementing reforms since mid-2015, and the \ncomplete the  implementing agencies of the proposed program (i.e., \nreforms weakens  CBA, FMSA, MOE, and MOF) were strongly engaged \nbecause of  in discussions with ADB and ADB TA experts over the \nvested interests  most challenging reform needs under their respective \nmandates.
