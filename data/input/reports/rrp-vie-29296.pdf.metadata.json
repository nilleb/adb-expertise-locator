From there it will be diverted through the existing Dau \nTieng \nirrigated  agriculture, \nsupplementary  water  for  urban  and  industrial use, and salinity control in \nthe Saigon and Vam Co Dong river basins. Three new irrigation areas will \nbe  developed  with  a  total  net  area  of  48,130  hectares:  Binh  Long \nirrigation  system  in  the  provinces  of  Binh  Phuoc  and  Binh  Duong,  Tan \nBien  irrigation  system  in  Tay  Ninh  province,  and  Duc  Hoa  irrigation \nsystem in Long An province. \n \nThe Dong Nai river basin consists of four major subbasins: the Dong Nai, \nBe, Saigon, and Vam Co Dong rivers covering 10 provinces including Ho \nChi  Minh  City  (HCMC).  It  contains  the  country\u2019s  largest  urban  and \nindustrial  development  areas  that  are  expanding,  and  water  demands \nhave  increased  and  will  continue  to  increase.  While  there  has  been \nrecent development of the water resources in the Dong Nai and Be river \nbasins  through  construction  of  reservoirs,  shortages  in  the  Saigon  and \nVam Co Dong river basins have become more critical over recent years. \nThis  is  constraining  existing  and  future  development  in  HCMC  and  its \nsurrounding provinces. \n \nWater  shortages  in  the  Saigon  and  Vam  Co  Dong  river  basins  are \ncausing  saline  advance  during  the  dry  season  and  users  in  the  lower \nreaches  frequently  suffer  from  deteriorating  water  quality.  It  has  already \nreached  a  stage  where  the  municipal  water  supply  authorities  of  HCMC \nare experiencing unacceptable salinity levels at the proposed intakes for \nnew  urban  water  supplies  that  are  urgently  needed  to  provide  for  the \nincreasing  demands.  With  higher  priority  given  to  supplying  water  for \nurban and industrial uses, the current situation rules out the potential for \nfurther  agricultural  development  in  rural  provinces  surrounding  HCMC. \nPotential  irrigation  development  cannot  proceed  due  to  lack  of  fresh \nwater, even though rural development is seen as an essential balance to \nthe concentration of urban growth in HCMC. \n \nA  number  of  studies  have  been  undertaken  to  consider  options  for \ndevelopment within the Dong Nai basin. The Dong Nai Water Resources \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nMaster  Plan  concluded  that  development  objectives  within  the  basin  will \nrequire  further  regulation  of  the  Be  river  and  transfer  of  water  to  the \nSaigon  river  to  control  salinity  intrusion  and  provide  water  for  urban, \nindustrial,  and  agricultural  uses.  This  was  further  supported  by  recent \nwater balance studies covering the Be, Saigon, and Vam Con  Dong river \nsystems, which show that without the basin transfers, shortages of fresh \nwater  will  increase  significantly  within  the  next  4\u20135  years  in  the  face  of \nrapidly increasing demands. These shortages will not only constrain new \ndevelopment,  but  also  impinge  on  existing  development.  It  will  become \nincreasingly necessary to substantially reduce cropping areas in existing \nirrigation  areas,  particularly  the  Dau  Tieng  irrigation  system,  in  favor  of \nurban  users  competing  for  the  limited  water  resources,  thus  imposing \nhardship on the rural community. \n \nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  provide  additional  water  in  the  Saigon \nand  Vam  Co  Dong  river  basins  for  development  of  irrigated  agriculture \nand  to  supplement  existing  supplies  for  salinity  control  and  domestic, \nmunicipal, and industrial use in HCMC and the surrounding provinces. \n \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $164.6 million  equivalent,  of  which \n$60.0 million is the foreign exchange cost and $104.6 million equivalent is \nthe local currency cost. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $90.0 million \nequivalent  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  finance  about  54.7%  of \nthe project cost and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement will cofinance \nabout $34.0 million (20.7%) through two other loans. The Government will \nfinance about $35.6 million equivalent in local currency (21.6%), and the \nbeneficiaries will contribute a further $5.0 million (3.0%). \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of various currencies equivalent to \n$90.0 million from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 31 March 2011 \n\n \nObjective \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n\n \n30 September 2010 \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD).  The \nconcerned  provincial  governments  will  assist  as  implementing  agencies \n(IAs). \n \nThe Central Project Office (CPO) of MARD (based in Hanoi) will oversee \nproject  implementation  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  management \nand administration. It will arrange procurement of consulting services, and \ncontracts  for  civil  works  and  equipment  under  international  competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  and  international  shopping.  The  CPO  will  establish  a \nmultidisciplinary  subunit  for  day-to-day  supervision  (based  in  HCMC \nalong  with  the  project  consultants)  to  be  known  as  the  project \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n \n\nfields  of \n\nintegrated  management, \n\nalong  with  the  project  consultants)  to  be  known  as  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  be  headed  by  a  full-time  \nmanager  supported  by  about  five  full-time  technical  and  administrative \nstaff.  The  PMU  will  subcontract  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan to an appropriate local institute as agreed by ADB. The \nCPO/PMU  will  guide  and  support  five  IAs  including  the  existing  Project \nManagement  Board  416  and  existing  provincial  project  management \nboards  in  each  of  the  four  participating  provinces  of  Binh  Phuoc,  Binh \nDuong, Tay Ninh, and Long An. \n \nGoods and services financed by ADB will be procured in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts for major works \nestimated to cost more than $2 million equivalent will be procured through \nICB  among  prequalified  firms.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost \n$2 million or less will be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) \nprocedures. Equipment packages over $500,000 will be procured through \nICB  while  smaller  packages  will  be  financed  through  international \nshopping or direct purchase. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  approximately  961  person-months of consulting \nservices: 214 international and 747 domestic. Expertise will be required in \nthe \ninstitutional  development, \nparticipatory  irrigation,  resettlement,  irrigation,  social  support  (including \ngender), finance, environmental management, agriculture, monitoring and \nevaluation,  water  systems  management,  hydraulic  structures  design, \nirrigation  and  drainage  system  design,  geotechnical  and  mechanical \nengineering,  construction  supervision,  and  contract  management. \nConsultants financed under the loan will be engaged in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  will \nbe recruited using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection method. \n \nThe  main  quantified  benefits  of  the  Project  are  incremental  outputs  of \nagricultural  products  from  48,130  hectares  in  the  three  irrigation \nsubproject areas, and increased production of fish from paddy fields and \nponds.  Significant  benefits  will  also  come  from  supply  of  raw  water  to \nHCMC  for  urban  and  industrial  use.  The  Project  is  economically viable \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 14.2% for the base case. \n \nAbout 30,200 households (about 169,100 persons) in the three irrigation \nsubproject areas will benefit directly from the Project. About 39% of these \nhouseholds  live  below  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  poverty  line.  It  is  estimated \nthat  improved  agricultural  production  will  increase  average  incomes  of \nbeneficiaries by about 40%, and that this will at least halve the number of \nhouseholds that live below the poverty line. In addition, a large number of \nhouseholds will benefit from improved supplies of water for domestic and \nindustrial  use  and  from  improved  salinity  control  in  downstream  reaches \nof rivers. \n \nThe  social  analysis  also  confirmed  that  the  burden  of  poverty  in  the \nproject  area  is  disproportionately  borne  by  women  and  other  vulnerable \nand disadvantaged groups (poor, landless, elderly, and illiterate). A social \n\n\fv \n\nand disadvantaged groups (poor, landless, elderly, and illiterate). A social \nsupport  program  will  be  implemented  to  assist  these  people  to  benefit \neither  directly  or  indirectly  from  the  Project.  They  will  be  assisted  to \nimprove  income-earning  opportunities,  access  credit,  and  develop  new \nlivelihood  skills.  The  same  program  will  aim  to  improve  the  health  and \neducation  of  these  groups  through  the  provision  of  reliable  domestic \nwater supplies and literacy training. \n \nThe  main  risk  for  the  Project  is  delay  in  realizing  the  expected  benefit \nstream, since the economic viability is sensitive to this. This could occur if \n(i) project  implementation  is  delayed,  especially  as  a  result  of difficulties \nin  finalizing  resettlement,  since  award  of  civil  works  contracts  is \nconditional  upon  this  being  achieved;  (ii) farmers  are  slow  to  adopt  the \nnew \n(iii) irrigation \nmanagement companies (IMCs) are unable to deliver the required quality \nof  irrigation  services.  These  risks  will  be  minimized  by  provision  of \nresources  to  assist  with  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  and  a \ncommunity  support  program  with  emphasis  on  institutional  development \nof water user groups, ensuring that they participate in decision making at \nan early stage of project preparation and implementation. The capacity of \nthe  IMCs  will  be  developed  to  undertake  their  responsibilities  for  future \nsystem management and operation. \n \n\nirrigated  agricultural  production  systems;  and \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n\ni\ni\n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project.1 The project \nframework is given in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nViet Nam ranks among the poorest countries in the region. Sustained economic growth \nand poverty reduction depend on improved access to and management of the country\u2019s water \nresources.  This  is  required  to  ensure  efficient  use  and  availability  of  water  supplies  for \nagricultural and industrial development, for increased municipal and domestic water demands, \nand  for  flood  control.  The  government  investment  strategy  in  the  water  resource  sector  has \ntraditionally  focused  on  subsector  interventions  for  irrigation,  hydropower,  water  supply,  and \nflood control, rather than focusing on an integrated approach for utilizing water  resources. This, \ncombined with the large number of subsector-based agencies involved in management and use \nof water resources, has resulted in a lower priority being given to the establishment of integrated \nwater resource planning and regulatory systems, and to efficient water resource use. \n \n3. \nTo address these constraints, the Government has introduced reforms and is developing \nnew  policies  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  management  and  use  of  water.2  The  reforms  have \nbeen  initiated  through  the  Water  Resource  Law  (WRL),  which  became  effective  in  1999.  It \ndefines the role of the National Water Resource Council, which was subsequently established in \n2000,  to  advise  the  Government  on  water  resource  management,  related  national  strategies, \nand  action  plans.  It  also  provides  for  the  establishment  of  river  basin  organizations  as  the \ninstitutions  responsible  for  river  basin  management.  In  November  2002,  the  Government \ntransferred  the  responsibility  for  water  resource  management  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture \nand  Rural  Development  (MARD)  to  the  newly  established  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment  (MONRE)  thereby  separating  the  functions  of  water  resource  management  from \nwater service delivery, an important step in the process of implementing the WRL.   \n \n4. \nAchievement of the objectives outlined in the WRL requires extensive capacity building \nof  both  MARD  and  MONRE,  including  the  provincial  counterpart  departments,  river  basin \norganizations,  irrigation  management  companies  (IMCs),  and  local  district  and  commune \nirrigation enterprises. With support of its development partners, MARD has started to implement \na comprehensive strategy for capacity building in water resource management. However, with \nthe  recent  establishment  of  MONRE,  responsibilities  for  implementing  the  strategy  will  be \nshared  by  both  MONRE  and  MARD.  Further  analysis  of  the  water  sector  is  presented  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n5. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  substantial  assistance  to  the  water \nsector in Viet Nam and  plans to continue this support as reflected in the County Strategy and \nProgram  (2002\u20132004)  and  the  subsequent  updates.    The  sector  is  also  supported  by  several \nother external funding agencies; the major participants are Australia, Denmark, France, Japan, \n\n________________________  \n1   The Project is included in the Country Strategy and Program, 2002\u20132004, of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It \nwas prepared under TA 2575-VIE: Phuoc Hoa Multipurpose Water Resources, for $600,000 approved on 31 May \n1996. This resulted in Loan 1598\u2013VIE: Phuoc Hoa Multipurpose Water Resources Engineering Project, approved \non 18 December 1997 for $2.6 million. \n\n2   Assistance  for  policy  work  is  being  provided  by  ADB  under  TA  3528-VIE:  Capacity  Building  in  Water  Resources \n\nManagement, for $3.8 million, approved in October 2000.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nKuwait,  Netherlands,  and  the  World  Bank.  A  summary  of  assistance  in  the  water  resources \nsector is presented in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  Dong  Nai  river  basin  has  a  catchment  area  of  47,300  square  kilometers  (km2), \n6. \nmaking  it  the  third  largest  in  Viet  Nam.  It  consists  of  four  major  subbasins:  the  Dong  Nai,  Be, \nSaigon,  and  Vam  Co  Dong  rivers  covering  10  provinces  including  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC). \nThe  basin  contains  the  country\u2019s  largest  urban  and  industrial  development  areas  that  are \nexpanding,  and  water  demands  have  increased  and  will  continue  to  increase.  Shortages  of \nfresh water are being experienced and the existing water resource management practices are \nunsustainable.  While  there  has  been  recent  development  of  the  water  resources  in  the  Dong \nNai and Be river basins through construction of reservoirs, shortages in the Saigon and Vam Co \nDong river basins have become more critical over recent years. This is constraining existing and \nfuture development in HCMC and its surrounding provinces. \n \nThe impact of water shortages in the Saigon and Vam Co Dong river basins is being felt \n7. \nin a number of ways. Flows in both of these rivers are under threat from saline advance during \nthe dry season to the extent that  users in the lower reaches frequently suffer from deteriorating \nwater quality. It has already reached a stage where municipal water supply authorities of HCMC \nare experiencing unacceptable salinity levels at proposed intakes for new urban water supplies, \nwhich are urgently needed to provide for the increasing demands. With higher priority given to \nsupplying  water  for  urban  and  industrial  uses,  the  current  situation  rules  out  the  potential  for \nfurther  agricultural  development  in  rural  provinces  surrounding  HCMC.  Potential  irrigation \ndevelopment cannot proceed due to lack of fresh water, even though rural development is seen \nas an essential balance to the concentration of urban growth in HCMC. \n \n8. \nThis rapid growth in demand and increasing pressure on the water resources have been \nhighlighted  by  a  number  of  water  resources  planning  studies  in  the  Dong  Nai  river  basin  over \nrecent years.3 To meet the increasing water demands, the Government has adopted a holistic \napproach in determining suitable development options. A first key step was the Dong Nai Water \nResources  Master  Plan  prepared  in  1996.  Taking  a  basin  perspective,  it  identified  the  key \nwater-related  issues  constraining  development  of  urban  and  industrial  areas,  and  considered \nvarious  options  to  transfer  water  from  the  Be  to  Saigon  basins.  The  basin  approach  will  be \nfurther  strengthened  through  the  Dong  Nai  river  basin  organization,  which  will  coordinate  and \nimprove river basin planning and management. This organization was established in 2001 but is \nnot  yet  active.4  The  second  important  step  is  the  Government\u2019s  proposal  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  existing  water  resource  systems.  As  part  of  this  process,  the  existing  Dau  Tieng \nirrigation system (DTIS) will be upgraded and modernized under the  Vietnam Water Resources \nAssistance Project (VWRAP) supported by the World Bank to optimize water use and secure its \ndam safety (see para. 36). \n \n9. \nLessons Learned. These are drawn mainly from large-scale irrigation and flood control \nprojects financed by ADB and the World Bank. In general, implementation progress and quality \n________________________  \n3   Dong  Nai  Water  Resources  Master  Plan,  May  1996,  financed  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency; \nMaster Plan for Ho Chi Minh City for $600,000, under TA 2000-VIE (ADB. 1993. HCMC Water Supply Master Plan. \nManila.);  and  the  Master  Plan  for  Southern  Economic  Focal  Zone,  September  1996,  financed  by  the  Australian \nAgency for International Development. \n\n4  Under TA 3528-VIE (ADB. 2000. Proposed Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity \nBuilding for Water Resources Management Project. Manila), ADB is assisting the Dong Nai river basin organization \nto  (i) develop  its  institutional  framework;  (ii) establish  processes  for  river  basin  planning  and  improved  water \nresource  management;  (iii) undertake  hydrological  modeling  and  watershed  planning;  and  (iv) improve  water \nquality. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nof  completed  infrastructure  is  satisfactory.  However,  the  earlier  projects  suffered  from  startup \ndelays  because  MARD  was  unfamiliar  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  procedures.  Experience  and \ncapacity has now improved to adequate levels. While monitoring surveys indicate that the target \ncommunities do benefit from these projects, the benefits usually fall short of projections because \nof  failure  to  address  both  the  physical  and  institutional  issues related to onfarm development. \nEmphasis is placed on construction of the major works components, while the minor works and \nrelated institutional issues, although equally important in terms of realizing project benefits, tend \nto  be  given  insufficient  emphasis.  As  a  result,  lower-order  canals  are  often  left  incomplete \nbecause the provinces, which are responsible for implementation of this work, usually lack the \nnecessary funding. This problem is highlighted in the project completion report of the Red River \nDelta Water Resources Sector Project, and also DTIS. Although DTIS was constructed almost \n20  years  ago,  it  has  only  partially  accomplished  the  envisaged  benefits  because  onfarm \ninfrastructure  is  incomplete  over  a  large  proportion  of  the  target  command  area  and  thus \nremains  unserviced.  This  has  caused  low  water  use  efficiencies  and  constrained  agricultural \nproduction.  This  highlights  the  need  to  ensure  that  there  is  adequate  funding  to  complete  the \nonfarm canal system during project implementation. Other lessons learned highlight the need to \ninvolve  farmers  at  an  early  stage  of  project  planning  and  design,  adopting  an  integrated  and \nparticipatory  approach  to  facilitate  development  of  institutional  capacity  of  water  user  groups \n(WUGs) to sustainably manage their irrigation system. This should be coupled with provision of \nagricultural  support  for  farmers  to  consider  realistic  options  for  developing  optimum  farming \nsystems. The lessons learned so far from the Second Red River Basin Sector Project (approved \nin  November  2001)  illustrate  the  need  for  implementation  requirements  and  approval \nprocedures to be kept as straightforward as possible to avoid startup delays experienced by that \nproject. The project design has made provisions to address these issues. \n \n10. \nProject Rationale . The Dong Nai Water Resources Master Plan (1996) concluded that \nthe development objectives within the Dong Nai basin cannot be met without further regulating \nthe  Be  river  and  transferring  water  to  the  Saigon  river  to  control  salinity  intrusion  and  provide \nwater for urban, industrial, and agricultural uses. This was further supported by water balance \nstudies undertaken during project preparation (2001). The water balance studies assessed the \nfuture  situation  with  and  without  basin  transfers  from  the  Be  river  to  the  Saigon  and  Vam  Co \nDong rivers. Results further highlighted that without the basin transfer, shortages of fresh water \nwill  worsen  significantly  within  the  next  4\u20135  years  in  the  face  of  rapidly  increasing  demands. \nThese  shortages  will  not  only  constrain  new  development,  but  also  impinge  on  existing \ndevelopment.  It  will  become  increasingly  necessary  to  substantially  reduce  cropping  areas  in \nexisting  irrigation  areas,  particularly  DTIS,  in  favor  of  urban  users  competing  for  the  limited \nwater  resources,  thus  imposing  hardship  on  the  rural  community.  The  proposed  Project  will \nremove the above constraints by transferring excess water from the Be river5 to the existing Dau \nTieng reservoir. It will provide reliable supplies, even in relatively dry years. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\nThe Project is to provide additional water in the Saigon and Vam Co Dong river basins \n11. \nfor  development  of  irrigated  agriculture  and  to  supplement  existing  supplies  for  salinity  control \nand  domestic,  municipal,  and  industrial  (DMI) use  in  HCMC  and  the  surrounding  provinces.  It \nwill  adopt  an  integrated  development  approach  to  increasing  agricultural  production  by \npromoting efficient and sustainable management of the water resources. \n\n________________________  \n5   Since  commissioning  the  Thac  Mo  hydropower  reservoir  in  the  upper  Be  river  in  1993,  daily  releases  have \n\nconsiderably increased the minimum dry season flows in the Be river compared with prior natural flows. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n12. \nThe  Project  will  develop  water  resources  infrastructure  comprising  basin  transfer  and \nfacilities,  and  new  irrigation  areas.  Water  from  the  Be  river  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Dau  Tieng \nreservoir  on  the  neighboring  Saigon  river.  From  there,  releases  can  be  controlled  to  supply \nwater  for  various  purposes.  These  include  (i) releases  to  the  Saigon  river  for  water  supply \nintakes6 and salinity control in the lower reaches; (ii) releases to the Vam Co Dong river via the \nexisting DTIS canals and  drains  for  salinity  control;  and  (iii) releases for irrigation in DTIS and \nthe new areas to be developed under the Project.  While the infrastructure provides the means \nfor  supplying  additional  water,  it  is  recognized  that  the  most  challenging  requirement  for \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Project  and  realization  of  the  benefits  is  an  integrated \napproach to develop adequate institutional capacity for sustainable management of the system \nat  all  levels.  This  is  needed  to  improve  the  operational  and  financial performance of the local \nirrigation  management  institutions.  There  must  also  be  adequate  support  for  resettlement, \nsocial, and environmental issues. The project outputs can therefore be considered in two parts, \none  to  support  institutional  and  integrated  development  (Part  A),  and  the  other  for  the  water \nresources infrastructure (Part B) as described below. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A\u2014Support for Institutional and Integrated Development  \n\na. \n\nProject and Sustainable System Management\u2014Component A1 \n\n13. \nThis  component  will  facilitate  overall  management  and  coordination  of  activities  during \nimplementation, and provide support to develop capacity within government institutions, IMCs, \nand  WUGs  for  sustainable  management  of  the  project  facilities.  Both  these  objectives  will  be \nmet  by  involving  the  organizations  responsible  for  management  of  the  scheme  in  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  implementation  responsibilities  will  be  assigned  in \naccordance with current government regulations. On this basis (i) MARD will be responsible for \nthe  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage,  transfer  canal,  and  main  canals;  (ii) provincial  governments  will  be \nresponsible  through  their  departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  (DARDs)  and \nprovincial  IMCs  for  primary  and  secondary  canals;7  and  (iii) for  tertiary  units,  farmers  will  be \nresponsible  with  technical  support  from  the  DARDs.  The  component  will  supplement \ngovernment resources required for setting up and operating the proposed implementation units. \nFormation  of  irrigation  WUGs  will  be  a  key  project  support  strategy  for  development  and \nmanagement of tertiary systems and this will be supported under Component A2. \n \nFor  ongoing  management  of  the  basin  transfer  system,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the \n14. \nDau Tieng IMC. As staff will require new and more sophisticated technical skills, a training and \ncapacity-building  program  will  be  implemented  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  consultants. \nThe  Project  will  also  prepare  and  implement  programs  to  develop  the  capacity  of  IMCs  to \nundertake the institutional responsibilities they have for future management and operation of all \nother project facilities. In the irrigation areas, this will involve improvement of IMCs\u2019 operational \nand  financial  performance,  by  assisting  them  to  redefine  their  overall  performance objectives, \ndevelop service delivery performance indicators and a resource-based management plan, and \nimprove  management  systems.  Models  for  service  delivery  contracts  between  IMCs  and \nbetween  IMCs  and  WUGs  will  also  be  developed.  Since  the  Project  entails  transfer  of  water \nthrough  the  existing  DTIS  to  be  modernized  under  VWRAP  (para.  36),  it  is  essential  that \n\n________________________  \n6   Ben Than is the major water supply intake which will supply DMI water for HCMC. It is to be developed in three \nstages to a maximum capacity of 10.5 m 3 per second. Stage 1 is currently under development and expected to be \ncommissioned in 2004. Stages 2 and 3 are expected to follow in about 2006 and 2012, respectively. \n\n7   The  provincial  DARDs  will  be  responsible  for  implementation,  and  will  then  transfer  the  facilities  to  the  existing \nprovincial IMCs for management and operation. The IMCs are within the institutional framework of the DARDs. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\finitiatives  under  this  Project  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  approach  and  models  developed \nand adopted under VWRAP to ensure consistency.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSupport for Onfarm and Social Development\u2014Component A2 \n\n15. \nThree major concerns will be addressed under this component. The first is the need for \ntimely  completion  of  onfarm  development8  if  the  full  benefits  of  the  Project  are  to  be  realized. \nThe second is the need for a comprehensive network of WUGs to be established from an early \nstage  to  enable  beneficiaries  to  participate  in  the  local-level  design  process  and  to  lay  the \ngroundwork for their subsequent management of the facilities to be financed under the Project. \nThirdly,  there  is  a  need  to  provide  social  support  for  families  in  the  irrigated  areas  who  are \nunable  to  benefit  directly  from  the  irrigation  development  or  who  are  adversely  affected  by \nconstruction work. \n \n16. \nThe  key  to  achieving  the  expected  agricultural  benefits  of  the  Project  is  onfarm \ndevelopment. This will involve a substantial effort at the farm level to ensure timely construction \nof  the  tertiary  units  and  a  sustainable  transformation  from  rain-fed  to  irrigated  agriculture. \nFarmers, as the key independent decision makers, will ultimately determine project success, so \ntheir participation is imperative if the demand for irrigation services and diversified cropping is to \nreach the levels proposed under the Project. \n \n17. \nThe component will finance a community mobilization program to facilitate a participatory \napproach  to  planning,  design,  and  installation  of  the  irrigation  systems  and  aim  to  address \nconstraints  related  to  onfarm  development.  An  institutional  framework  for  sustainable  future \nmanagement of the tertiary system will be developed at the same time. Qualified organizations \nsuch as social science institutes or nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be contracted to \nprovide  the  required  community  mobilization  and  social  intermediation  services.  They  will \nprovide  teams  of  community  mobilizors  working  at  field  level.  An  initial  pilot  program  will  field \ntest the process and document each phase to support subsequent widespread replication. \n \n18. \nParticipatory design of tertiary units will start with farmer reviews of appropriate cropping \npatterns,  as  these  determine  canal  capacities  and  influence  layouts.9  This  will  be  followed  by \nfarmer  review  of  tertiary  unit  layouts  prepared  by  engineers  to  suit  the  topography.  Pilot \nexperience  will  be  used  to  develop  appropriate  guidelines  and  criteria  to  ensure  gravity \ncommand  of  tertiary  units.  It  is  envisaged  that  farmers  will  be  mobilized  to  contribute  to  the \nconstruction  of  the  tertiary  units,  mainly  through  labor  for  earthworks.  This  would  represent \nabout 70% of the cost of the tertiary unit development.10 The remaining 30% would be financed \nthrough funding to be provided through the provinces. \n \n19. \nThe community mobilizors will provide a key link between government agencies and the \ncommunity,  and  therefore,  for  logistical  efficiency,  will  also  conduct  other  functions  requiring \ncommunity mobilization and participation. First, they will assist with detailed design of the larger \ncanals by facilitating a participatory approach. Second, they will assist with implementation of a \n\n________________________  \n8   Onfarm  development  includes  tertiary  structures  and  investment  by  individual  farmers  covering  the  lower  order \n(farm) distribution systems, supplementary farm pumps where applicable, and establishment of cropping systems, \nespecially perennial crops. \n\n9  Factors  that  determine  the  design  include  land  suitability,  returns  to  land  and  labor,  practical  issues  related to \nirrigating upland crops following wet season rice, tertiary rotations to facilitate intermittent irrigation of upland crops, \nand irrigation duration. \n\n10 The arrangements for farmer contributions will be developed on the basis of the pilots and will be coordinated with \n\nVWRAP. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nsocial  support  program  (para.  20),  since  there  will  be  an  overlap  with  target  groups  for  social \nsupport and onfarm development. \n \n20. \nSocial  Support  Program.  This  component  will  finance  a  social  support  program  for \ngroups with special needs. It includes provision to install small-scale water supply systems and \nto  conduct  workshops  and  training  to  improve  hygiene,  education,  and  livelihood  skills,  and \nincorporates  a  gender  action  plan.11  The  provinces,  with  assistance  from  consultants  and \ncommunity  mobilizors,  will  implement  the  program  through  a  community-based approach. The \nmain  target  groups  are  (i) those  adversely  affected  by  resettlement;  (ii) irrigation beneficiaries \nwho need assistance to take advantage of the improved opportunities provided by the Project; \nand  (iii) disadvantaged  groups  within  the  irrigation  areas,  including  the  poor  and  landless \nhouseholds headed by women, and vulnerable ethnic minority households and communities. An \nintegrated  participatory  process  to  stimulate  demand  and  meet  their  diverse  needs  will  be \nimplemented  and  will  involve  capacity  building  for  disadvantaged  people,  and  income \nrestoration  of  households  severely  affected  by  land  acquisition.  The  program  will  establish \nlinkages  with  existing  social  organizations  including  NGOs,  and  with  bilateral  and  government \nprograms  within  the  project  area.  There  will  be  assistance  for  the  poor  and  landless  (mainly \nwomen)  to  develop  new  skills  and  use  the  microfinance  services  available  under  existing \nprograms to create employment and income opportunities. \n \n\nc. \n\nResettlement\u2014Component A3 \n\n21. \nThis  component  will  finance  implementation  of  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs).  It  will  be \nclosely  linked  to  Component  A2,  which  will  provide  social  support  for  households  severely \naffected  by  resettlement.  Land  will  need  to  be  acquired  for  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage  and  all \ncanals  down  to  tertiary  level.  Land  acquisition  requirements  for  the  barrage  have  been \nminimized through careful evaluation of alternative sites, and the canal alignments will be fine-\ntuned through a participatory process to minimize land acquisition and disruption to the affected \npeople.  About  2,173  households  (11,138  persons)  will  be  affected  with  about  3,153  hectares \n(ha)  of  land  to  be  permanently  acquired.  Some  land  will  also  be  required  for  temporary  use \nduring  construction.  It  is  estimated  that  1,009  households  will  be  severely  affected  by  the \npermanent  loss  of  agricultural  land,  including  453  households  who  will  lose  their  houses and \nhave  to  be  relocated.  Only  21  shops  or  small  businesses  will  need  to  be  relocated.  The \npermanent inundation zone of the Phuoc Hoa barrage is 1,178 ha, affecting 759 households of \nwhich 109 will have to be relocated. \n \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the  Handbook \n22. \non  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice,  a  full  RP  has  been  prepared  for  the  barrage, \nreservoir  area,  transfer  canal,  and  main  canals.  It  will  be  updated  after  detailed  design.  A \nseparate resettlement framework has been prepared to guide the preparation of a separate RP \nfor  each  of  the  three  irrigation  areas  after  their  participatory  design.  The  RP  and  framework \nrequire  that  severely  affected  farmers  be  offered  the  option  of  replacement  land  wherever \npossible, or cash compensation sufficient to purchase replacement land of equivalent area and \nproductivity. Compensation for structures will be paid at full replacement cost of materials and \nlabor  with  no  deduction  for  depreciation  or  salvageable  materials.  Allowances  will  be  paid  to \ncover  all  costs  incurred  during  the  transition  period.  Income  losses  will  be  restored  through \nprovisions  of  the  social  support  program  to  be  implemented  under  Component  A2,  and  the \nprogram  will  benefit  disadvantaged  households  affected  by  land  acquisition.  All  provinces  will \nupdate their compensation rates prior to preparation of the final RPs. A summary of the RP and \nframework is presented in Appendix 4.   \n\n________________________  \n11 The program was prepared on the basis of findings of the social surveys conducted during project preparation. \n \n\n \n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nd. \n\nEnvironmental Management\u2014Component A4 \n\n23. \nThis  component  will  implement  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to  mitigate \nthe  adverse  environmental  impact  effects  caused  by  the  Project.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA)  and  a  summary  EIA  (SEIA)  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Environmental Assessment.12 The EIA identified a number of potentially negative \nimpacts including: (i) involuntary resettlement, (ii) reduction of flows in the Be river as a result of \nthe  basin  transfer,  (iii) possible  increased  pressure  on  the  recently  declared  Lo  Go  Xe  Mat \nNational  Park  and  other  forest  areas  adjacent  to  the  proposed  new  irrigation  in  Tay  Ninh \nprovince, (iv) potential for increased levels of acidity in rivers as a result of reclamation of acid \nsulfate  soils  in  the  Duc  Hoa,  (v) disturbances  during  construction,  and  (vi) dangers due to the \npresence of unexploded ordnance. \n \n24. \nTo  mitigate  the  potential  negative  impacts  due  to  construction  and  operation  of  the \nProject to acceptable levels, the EMP recommended a comprehensive range of measures. They \ninclude: release of minimum environmental flows in the Be river downstream of the Phuoc Hoa \nbarrage; establishment of water quality monitoring stations at key locations in the lower reaches \nof the various basins concerned; improving local capacity to protect the national park and forest \nareas,  and  implementing  a  buffer  zone  management  program  in  Tay  Ninh;  strict  control  on \npossible reclamation of the acid sulfate soils of Duc Hoa District; and provision for detecting and \nclearing  unexploded  ordnances.  Surveys  and  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  determine  the \noptimum  management  of  fisheries  to  mitigate  the  affects  associated  with  construction  of  the \nPhuoc Hoa barrage. There is also provision for ongoing monitoring of impacts during and after \nthe  Project.  Provision  is  made  for  the  EMP  to  be  updated  during  the  first  year  of  the  Project, \nincorporating  up-to-date  data  that  are  being  collected  under  ongoing  water  quality  monitoring \nprograms.  All  measures  necessary  for  the  satisfactory  mitigation  of environmental impacts will \nbe implemented in accordance with the requirements of the Government and ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B\u2014Water Resources Infrastructure \n\na. \n\nBasin Transfer\u2014Component B1 \n\n25. \nThe  basin  transfer  facilities  comprise  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage  on  the  Be  river  and  the \ntransfer  canal  for  gravity  diversion  of  water  to  the  Dau  Tieng  reservoir  located  about \n40 kilometers (km) to the west in the neighboring Saigon river basin. The Phuoc Hoa barrage is \nlocated  on  the  Be  river  102  km  upstream  of  its  confluence  with  the  Dong  Nai  river.  The  total \ncatchment  area  of  Be  river  is  8,310  km2  of  which  5,200  km2  is  upstream  of  the  proposed \nbarrage where two major hydropower reservoirs are located.13  \n \nPhuoc Hoa Barrage. The barrage site was selected after extensive comparative studies \n26. \nof various sites and alternate options aimed at finding the optimum balance between technical \naspects, costs, and minimizing resettlement and social disruption. The barrage will raise water \nlevels in the Be river to enable gravity  diversion of basin transfers. Since its main function is to \ndivert  run-of-river  flows,  the  barrage  has  only  a  small  live  storage  capacity.  However,  live \nstorage  is  sufficient  to  ensure  maximum  design  discharges  for  downstream  environmental \npurposes and transfer diversions can be maintained at all times despite the daily fluctuations in \nriver flow caused by operation of the upstream hydroelectricity dam. Water levels during normal \noperation will vary by only about 0.4 meters (m). \n\n________________________  \n12 The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 8 May 2003. \n13 Thac Mo reservoir commissioned in 1993, and Can Don due to be commissioned in 2003. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nThe barrage consists of an earthfill embankment with a total length of about 900 m, less \n27. \nthan  about  10  m  high  except  for  about  50  m  where  it  increases  to  a  maximum  of  28  m  as  it \ncrosses  the  existing  river  channel.  Total  storage  (live  and  dead)  is  18.5 million  cubic  meters. \nThe  barrage  has  a  100  m  wide  spillway  structure  with  a  fixed  crest  overflow  spillway  in  the \ncentral  section  to  pass  normal  flows  up  to  mean  annual  flood,  and  four  radial  gates  to  pass \nlarger floods. The design standard adopted is to avoid overtopping of  the embankment during a \n1 in 10,000-year flood. Sluicing arrangements are also provided for management of sediment. \nAs  upstream  water  levels  will  be  about  18  m  above  downstream  levels  during  normal \noperations,  provision  for  a  fishpass  to  facilitate  the  natural  migration  of  fish  may  need  to  be \nconsidered.14 Physical model testing will be conducted during detailed design phase to confirm \nthe designs. \n \nCompensation  and  resettlement  of  affected  people  within  the  immediate  construction \n28. \nzone will be completed before the construction contract is awarded. The barrage is located off-\nstream, so the first major phase of construction can be completed before river closure becomes \nnecessary, thus allowing about 1 year from the start of construction to complete  resettlement of \npeople within the inundation area. Resettlement of this group of people will be required before \nriver closure can proceed. \n \n29. \nTransfer  Canal.  The  canal  is  38  km  long  and  has  a  maximum  capacity  of  75  cubic \nmeters/second  (m3/s),  reducing  to  a  minimum  of  65  m3/s  after  the  offtakes  to  proposed  new \nirrigation areas. A head regulator will control diversion flows from the barrage. Other structures \ninclude  a  cross  regulator,  an  emergency  outlet,  cross  drainage,  and  bridge  crossings  to  avoid \ndisruption  to  local  communities.  Alternative  designs  were  considered  to  minimize  excavation \nalong  the  canal  route,  particularly  where  it  crosses  the  catchment  divide  between  the  Be  and \nSaigon river basins. Concrete lining of the full length of the canal  is envisaged.15 In view of the \nsubstantial  earthworks  involved  in  canal  construction,  the  designs  place  special  emphasis  on \nminimizing loss of productive land adjacent to the canal due to disposal of surplus spoil. As far \nas  practical,  surplus  material  will  be  hauled  to  reaches  where  filling  is  required,  although  the \nmost economic solution in some sections is to spread spoil on each side of the cut.16 \n \n\nb. \n\nIrrigation Development Transfer\u2014Component B2 \n\n30. \nThree  new  irrigation  areas  will  be  developed  under  the  Project:  Binh  Long  irrigation \nsystem  (BLIS)  in  the  provinces  of  Binh  Phuoc  and  Binh  Duong,  Tan  Bien  irrigation  system \n(TBIS)  in  Tay  Ninh  province,  and  Duc  Hoa  irrigation  system  (DHIS)  in  Long  An  province.  The \ntotal net command area of the three systems is 48,130 ha. Each is described below. \n \n31. \nBinh Long Irrigation System. BLIS has a net command area of  5,860 ha. The transfer \ncanal  divides  the  area  into  two  separate  blocks:  3,920 ha on the northern side mostly in Binh \nPhuoc  province,  and  1,840  ha  on  the  southern  side,  all  of  which  is  located  in  Binh  Duong \nprovince. Water for the area  will be extracted from the transfer canal by pumps located  19 km \ndownstream of the Phuoc Hoa barrage, since the service area is higher than water levels at the \n\n________________________  \n14  Because the reservoirs upstream of the barrage do not have fishpasses and severely impact natural fisheries in the \nBe river, the requirements for a fishpass will be carefully reviewed to determine whether there are more effective \nalternatives to mitigate impact on the fisheries. \n\n15 Although  an  unlined  canal  was  considered  for  ease  of  construction  and  lower  cost,  a  comparative  analysis \nconcluded in favor of lining because of savings in excavation. In addition, the superior hydraulic efficiency will allow \nhigher flow velocities, which will inhibit weed growth. \n\n16 Where this is necessary, provision is made for temporary clearance and subsequent restoration of the land. Topsoil \nwill be removed and later replaced, and drainage will be provided so the land can be returned to full production. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f9 \n\nbarrage. A cross-regulator will be provided on the transfer canal just downstream of the pumps \nto maintain stable water levels. \n \n32. \nTan  Bien  Irrigation  System.  The  net  command  area  of  TBIS  is  13,400  ha.  Water  for \nthis  area  will  be  conveyed  from  the  Dau  Tieng  reservoir  via  the  existing  West  Main  Canal  of \nDTIS,  which  already  has  adequate  capacity  over  most  of  its  length  to  accommodate  the \nadditional  demands  to  supply  to  TBIS,  although  some  upgrading  will  be  required  in  some \nsections.  This  work  will  be  done under VWRAP. The Project will construct a new main canal, \nabout 24 km long from the tail end of the existing West Main Canal. Irrigation supply for about \n40% of the area will be pumped, while the remainder will be irrigated by gravity. \n \n33. \nDuc  Hoa Irrigation System.  The  net  command  area  of  DHIS  is  28,880  ha:  17,560  ha \nwith  a  relatively  high  elevation,  and  11,320  ha  of  lower  elevation  under  influence  of  tidal \nmovement  in  the  Vam  Co  Dong  river.  Irrigation  supplies  for  the  higher  area  will  be  conveyed \nfrom the Dau Tieng reservoir via the 33 km long East Main Canal of Dau Tieng and a new 20 \nkm long DHIS main canal. The East Main Canal will be upgraded under VWRAP to achieve the \nadditional 25 m3/s flow capacity required for the Duc Hoa area. The low-lying area will receive \nirrigation  supplies  through  Dau  Tieng\u2019s  West  Canal  and  a  natural  drain  connecting  this  canal \nand the Vam Co Dong river. The West Canal will not require additional upgrading to convey an \nadditional 5 m3/s flow to supplement the flows in the Vam Co Dong river.  \n \n34.  Much  of  the  DHIS  area  is  already  irrigated  to  some  extent,  mostly  pumped  from \ngroundwater for the higher areas, although the quality and quantity of this source is deteriorating \ndue to overuse.17  Lack of fresh water, particularly in the dry season, is depressing yields and \nlimiting cropping intensity. Freeing the higher areas from dependency on pumped groundwater \nis  considered  to  be  a  major  long-term benefit.  The  Duc  Hoa  area  contains  pockets  of  acid \nsulfate soils (about 1,250 ha) that are not included in the net command area. It is envisaged that \nthese will be progressively remediated and reclaimed for irrigated agriculture. If so, this will be \ndone  strictly  according  to  procedures  set  out  in  the  EMP  to  ensure  this  does  not  result  in \nnegative environmental impacts (para. 69[v]). \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nAdvance  Detailed  Design.  The  Government  approved  its  feasibility  study  for  the \nProject  in  July  2002.  This  has  allowed  MARD  to  proceed  with  preparation  of  detailed designs \nunder national funding to have them at an advanced stage by the time the loan is effective. This \nwill accelerate the implementation schedule of the Project and minimize the time required for the \nstart-up activities and award of the major civil works contracts. The specific scope of work to be \ncovered during advanced detailed design includes detailed topographic survey and geotechnical \ninvestigations;  physical  hydraulic  model  studies  of  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage;  preparation  of \nconstruction  drawings  for  the  major  works  (barrage,  transfer  canal,  and  main  canals);  and \npreparation  of  technical  specifications.18  The  loan  consultants  will  review  the  designs,  and \nrecommend revisions as necessary.  \n \nLinks between Phuoc Hoa and Dau Tieng Irrigation  System. The Project is closely \n36. \nlinked to DTIS since it will divert flows into the existing Dau Tieng reservoir, from where it will be \ndistributed  for  irrigation,  salinity  control,  and  DMI  uses.  This  means  that  the  Project\u2019s  overall \nsuccess depends heavily on the safe and efficient functioning of DTIS. However, it is currently in \n________________________  \n17 A small part of the area in the northwest (approximately 500 ha) is already irrigated from two pumping stations. \n18 The hydraulic model will be retained for use of the loan consultants for further testing and confirmation of results \nand  therefore  the  development  costs  of  the  model  (about  $50,000)  will  be  funded  retroactively  by  the  Project \nfollowing approval of the loan.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fneed of upgrading and modernization which will be done under the VWRAP (para. 8). VWRAP \nwill  improve  dam  safety,  upgrade  the  main  and  distribution  canals,  and  introduce  modern \nmanagement practices to optimize water distribution. \n \nThe East and West Main Canals of DTIS will have to be upgraded to meet the objectives \n37. \nof VWRAP. Irrigation supplies for the new areas of TBIS and DHIS will be routed through these \ncanals. In the case of the East Main Canal, some of the same sections also need enlargement \nto  meet  the  requirements  of  this  Project  (see  para.  33).  To  overcome  the  overlapping \nrequirements of the two projects, it has been agreed with the Government and the World Bank \nthat VWRAP will cover all necessary work of the East Main Canal, incorporating allowance for \nincreased capacity to serve the new areas to be developed under this Project. VWRAP will also \nconstruct  the  head  regulators  for  the  main  canals  of  TBIS  and  DHIS.  This clearly demarcates \nthe physical works and avoids overlap. \n \n38. \nFollowing  preappraisal  for  VWRAP  in  June\u2013July  2003,  World  Bank  management  has \nendorsed  further  processing  of  an  International  Development  Association  loan  for  VWRAP. \nApproval of the World Bank board is expected in February 2004, and this is set as a condition \nfor signing the Phuoc Hoa loan (para. 70). \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n39. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $164.6 million  as  shown  in  Table  1.  This  includes \n10%  physical  contingencies,  price  contingencies,  and  interest  on  the  ADB  loan  during \nimplementation.  About  $60.0 million  of  the  total  is  foreign  exchange.  Prices  are  in  mid-2002 \nvalues, and include value added and other taxes as appropriate. Costs for Part A: Support for \nInstitutional  and  Integrated  Development  are  25%  of  base  costs  with  costs  for  Part  B:  Water \nResources  Infrastructure,  comprising  the  balance.  Table  A5.1  of  Appendix  5  shows  the \nestimates in more detail. \n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\n(Part A) \n\n \n \n  \n A.

Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD) has agreed in principle to \nprovide  $34.0 million  to  finance  about  20.7%  of  the  total  project  costs  through  two  separate \nloans.19  Farmers  would  contribute  in  kind  by  providing  labor  to  construct  tertiary  canal \nearthworks to the value of $5.0 million (3%). The Government will finance a total of $35.6 million \n(about  21.6%),  which  includes  about  $12 million  of  duties  and  taxes.  The  financing  plan  is \nsummarized in Table 2, and details are provided in Appendix 5, Table A5.2. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\n Financier \n \n   \n  \n \n Asian Development Bank \n \n Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n \n Farmers (provided in kind) \n \n Government \nTotal  \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nForeign \n\n46.4 \n13.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n60.0 \n\n  Local \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n43.6 \n20.4 \n5.0 \n35.6 \n104.6 \n\n  Total \n  \n90.0 \n \n34.0 \n \n5.0 \n \n35.6 \n \n  164.6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n\n54.7 \n20.7 \n3.0 \n21.6 \n100.0 \n\n1. \n\nProject Organization and Management \n\nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  will  be  MARD  through  its  Central  Project \n41. \nOffice (CPO) based in Hanoi, with the Director of CPO as the project director. The CPO will take \noverall responsibility for (i) managing, coordinating, and overseeing the Project, and will provide \nthe  interface  with  ADB  and  AFD;  (ii) arranging  procurement  of  consulting  services,  and \ncontracts  for  civil  works  and  equipment  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  and \ninternational  shopping;  (iii) managing project finances including audit of project accounts, loan \ndisbursements,  and  financial  statements;  (iv) preparing  quarterly  progress  reports;  and \n(v) preparing the completion report. The CPO is experienced in the implementation of ADB- and \nWorld  Bank-financed  projects  covering  these  aspects  and  its  performance  has  generally  been \nsatisfactory. To ensure adequate staffing resources are allocated to the Project, it will establish \na multidisciplinary subunit based in HCMC specifically dedicated to day-to-day supervision to be \nknown as the project management unit (PMU). The PMU will be headed by a full-time manager \nwho will be a deputy director and permanent staff of CPO experienced in the implementation of \nsuch projects. Other key staff of the PMU will include experienced permanent staff of the CPO, \nwhile others may be subcontracted locally. As the PMU will be responsible for implementing the \nEMP, it will subcontract this task to an appropriate local institute agreed by ADB. \n \n42. \nThe  CPO/PMU  will  provide  guidance  and  coordination  for  the  five  implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  including  MARD\u2019s  Project  Management  Board  416  (PMB416)  and  the  four \nprovincial  project  management  boards  (PPMBs)  in  the  provinces  of  Binh  Phuoc,  Binh  Duong, \n\n________________________  \n19  The two AFD loans would include one for $31.9 million equivalent with a maturity of 20 years (7 years\u2019 grace) at an \ninterest of 2.5% per annum, and a second loan of  $3.1 million  equivalent  with  a  maturity  of  30  years  (10  years\u2019 \ngrace) at an interest rate of 1.0% per annum. AFD financing will be on a parallel basis except for a small portion of \nthe second loan, which will cofinance consulting services. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nTay Ninh, and Long An.20 PMB416 will be strengthened in a phased manner to ensure adequate \nstaffing  levels  during  project  implementation.  It  will  be  responsible  for  design,  contract \nmanagement,  and  construction  supervision  of  the  major  civil  works  contracts  including  the \nPhuoc  Hoa  barrage,  the  transfer  canal,  and  the  main  and  primary  canals  for  each  of  the \nirrigation subprojects. The four PPMBs will have responsibility for development of the irrigation \nareas  within  each  of  their  provinces,  including  resettlement,  social  mobilization  and  support \nprograms, design and supervision of civil works contracts for secondary canals, and the related \nonfarm development. PMB416 and the PPMBs shall be responsible for the procurement of civil \nworks  and  equipment  to  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  and  other  local \nprocurement.  In  order  to  coordinate  the  activities  of  the  IAs  and  facilitate  an  integrated \napproach, a project consultative committee will be set up comprising the PMU manager, senior \nprovincial representatives, and IAs. It will meet regularly (at least quarterly) in the project area, \nand the consultant team leader and deputy will provide secretarial support. \n \n43. \nA  project  steering  committee  will  be  constituted  to  guide  the  project  activities.  The \ncommittee will be chaired by a vice-minister of MARD, and will comprise the vice-chairpersons \nof Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh, Long An, and HCMC people's committees, other MARD \nstaff  including  the  CPO  director,  and  representatives  at  director  level  from  the  ministries  of \nPlanning  and  Investment,  Finance,  and  Natural  Resources  and  Environment;  the  Office  of \nGovernment, and the State Bank of Vietnam. Links between the project steering committee and \nthe  Dong  Nai  river  basin  organization  will  be  established  to  be  formalized  and  agreed  during \nearly  stages  of  implementation  to  ensure  full  stakeholder  participation  in  decision-making on \nissues that  affect  the  overall  management  of  water  resources  in  the  basin  such  as  operating \nguidelines  for  basin  transfers,  water  quality,  and  other  environmental  matters.  The  project \norganization chart is presented in Appendix 6. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6.5-year  period  beginning  in  early  2004.  The \n44. \nschedule allows adequate time for a participatory approach to design and prepare the final RPs \nonce the detailed engineering designs have been confirmed. Provision is made for approval and \nimplementation  of  the  RPs  prior  to  the  award  of  civil  works  contracts.  For  the  Phuoc  Hoa \nbarrage  and  transfer  canal,  there  is  provision  for  completion  of  construction  and  a  1-year \ncommissioning  and  operation  phase,  including  training  of operations staff. The schedule also \nallows for full development of the irrigation subprojects, including the tertiary canal and onfarm \ndevelopment,  which  will  be  done  through  an  integrated  and  participatory  approach.  An \nimplementation schedule for the Project is presented in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  follow  the  rationale  that  the  agency  or \n45. \ngroup  that  will  be  responsible  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the  water  resources \ninfrastructure will be fully involved in its planning, design, and construction. There will be three \nlevels of O&M responsibility: national, provincial, and farm levels. The national level covers the \ninterprovincial  facilities  (barrage  and  transfer  canal,  and  main  canals  for  each  of  the  irrigation \n\n________________________  \n20 The  PPMBs  are  existing  subunits  within  the  DARDs  of  each  of  the  concerned  provinces.  They  are  specifically \nmandated to implement water resources projects, and are adequately experienced in  technical aspects of irrigation \nwork. The PPMBs will be provided with support for a participatory integrated approach (resettlement, social, and \nenvironmental aspects) for which they generally have limited experience. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f13 \n\nsubprojects).  These  will  be  managed  by  MARD  through  the  existing  Dau  Tieng  IMC.21  The \nProject  will  provide  the  necessary  training  and  capacity  building.  At  the  provincial  level,  the \nrespective  IMCs  will  manage  the  primary and secondary canals generally serving areas more \nthan  150  ha.  Canals  serving  less  than  150  ha,  generally  the  tertiary  units  and  lower,  will  be \nmanaged by WUGs. \n \n46. \nFinancing  the  O&M  costs  for  project  facilities  is  based  on  the  premise  that  adequate \nwater  user  fees  will  be  collected.22  The  current  fee  structure  set  by  government  regulations  is \ngenerally considered adequate to cover O&M costs; the critical issue is to ensure the fees are \ncollected.  Experience  in  Viet  Nam  shows  that  water  user  fees  can  be  readily  collected  if  the \nservice delivery is satisfactory, which places the onus on the Project to ensure that the systems \nare  able  to  operate  properly  and  are  well  managed.  The  Project  aims  to  achieve  this  by \nemphasizing  establishment  of  institutional  arrangements  that  promote  participation  of  the  end-\nusers in decision making during preparation and implementation. This focuses on involvement \nof  provincial  IMCs  and  irrigation  groups  with  a  view  to  fostering  high  levels  of  ownership  that \npromote cost recovery for sustainable O&M. The Government has provided assurances that it \nwill  develop  sustainable  system  management  and  pursue  a  policy  of  cost  recovery  for  O&M \ncosts. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement  \n\n47. \nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $2 million \nequivalent  will  be  procured  through  ICB  among  prequalified  firms  with  proven  technical \ncompetence acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $2 million or less will be \nprocured  through  LCB  procedures.  Indicative  procurement  packages  are  presented  in \nAppendix 8.  State-owned  enterprises  will  be  eligible  to  bid  for  contracts  if  they  are  financially \nautonomous, independently managed, and operate on the basis of commercial practices. \n \n48. \nA range of equipment will be procured under the Project including vehicles, computers, \nsoftware, water quality monitoring equipment, and pumping installations.23 ADB-financed supply \ncontracts (for  goods)  costing  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  ICB,  and  supply \ncontracts  up  to  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping;  small  or \noff-the-shelf items valued at less than $100,000 may be procured under direct purchase. Items \nwith similar specifications will be combined into one package. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services and Counterpart Support \n\n49. \nThe  Project  will  require  approximately  961  person-months  of  consulting  services:  214 \ninternational,  and  747  domestic.  Expertise  will  be  required  in  the  fields  of  integrated \nmanagement,  institutional  development,  participatory  irrigation,  resettlement,  irrigation,  social \nsupport  (including  gender),  finance,  environmental  management,  agriculture,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  water  systems  management,  hydraulic  structures  design,  irrigation  and  drainage \nsystem  design,  geotechnical  and  mechanical  engineering,  construction  supervision,  and \ncontract  management.24  Consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  engaged  in  accordance \n\n________________________  \n21 The Project has made provision to expand  the  Dau  Tieng  IMC  to  include  an  additional  Phuoc  Hoa  subunit  with \nspecific responsibility for management of the basin transfers. The establishment of such unit and the details of its \nstaffing will be assessed during project implementation in coordination with VWRAP. \n\n22 Since  operation  of  the  system  will  commence  before  fee  collection  is  fully  activated,  project  funds  have  been \n\nallocated to cover O&M during implementation. \n\n23  It is envisaged that equipment for pumping installations will normally be included in the civil works contracts. \n24 The consultants will be designated the engineer for the management of ICB contracts. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor  engaging  domestic  consultants.  MARD  agrees  that  the  consultants  will  be  recruited  using \nADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection method. Most of the consulting services will be provided \nunder  a  single  package  by  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  domestic \nconsultants.  In  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  MARD  is  proceeding  with  advance  action  to \nrecruit  consultants  up  to  the  point  of  shortlisting,  prior  to  loan  approval.  The  Government  has \nbeen advised that this does not commit ADB to financing inputs in the event that the loan is not \napproved.  The  Project  will  also  contract  out  services  to  prequalified  local  institutions  or  NGOs \nwho  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Consultants,  local  institutions,  and \nNGOs  financed  by  cofinanciers  will  be  recruited  in  consultation  with  ADB.  MARD  will  provide \noffice  accommodation  for  the  consultants  in  HCMC,  and  support  administrative  costs  for \ncounterpart staff. The terms of reference are presented in Appendix 9. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n50. \nDisbursements for the Project will cover a wide range of activities, from relatively small \nones  covered  under  Part  A,  to  relatively  large  for  progress  payments for civil works contracts. \nTo  facilitate  timely  disbursements,  a  central  imprest  account  will  be  established  by  CPO \nimmediately after loan effectiveness, in accordance with procedures of the Ministry of Finance \nand  the  State  Bank  of  Vietnam.  Payments  will  be  made  to  and  from  these  accounts  for  all \neligible  expenditures  under  the  Project.  MARD,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will  develop \nprocedures  to  ensure  that  each  of  the  five  IAs  (PMB416  and  the  four  PPMBs)  can  establish \nsecond-generation  imprest  accounts  to  facilitate  project  implementation  at  the  local  level.  The \nimprest  accounts  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not \nexceed the estimated expenditure for the first 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower. MARD may use the statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure to liquidate advances, in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed \nunder the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $100,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  CPO,  assisted  by  the  project  implementation  consultants,  will  prepare  separate \n51. \naccounts for the Project as a whole. Accounts of  each IA will be monitored and consolidated by \nthe  CPO.  Within  12  months  after  loan  effectiveness,  MARD  will  establish  a  computerized \nmanagement information system suited to project needs in CPO (to be managed by the PMU in \nHCMC)  for  efficient  monitoring,  financial  management,  and  reporting  of  component  progress \nand  contracts.  An  auditing  firm  selected  through  LCB  will  audit  the  accounts  and  financial \nstatement  for  the  Project  annually.  The  audit  will  specifically  cover  the  imprest  accounts  and \nstatements of expenditure, and a separate opinion of these will be included in the audit reports. \nThe audit must be carried out as part of the regular annual audit of MARD's general accounts, \nand the report submitted to ADB annually within 9 months of the close of each fiscal year. \n \n52. \nEach  agency  involved  in  the  Project  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports.  The \nmanager  of  the  PMU  will  consolidate  and  submit  the  reports  within  1  month  to  ADB  and  AFD \nthrough  the  project  director.  The  reports  will  detail  the  achievements  to  date  as  related  to  the \nimplementation  schedule,  targets,  and  plans  for  the  next  reporting  period,  problems  requiring \nresolution, and steps being taken to resolve them. Reporting will make use of the computerized \nnetworking  and  e-mail  system  to  be  developed.  MARD  will  prepare  and  submit  a  project \ncompletion report to ADB/AFD within 6 months after physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f15 \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n53. \nADB\u2019s project performance management system (PPMS) will be  adopted for monitoring \nand evaluating implementation performance and development impacts at various stages of the \nproject cycle. The CPO/PMU, in collaboration with PMB416, PPMBs, and beneficiaries, will be \nresponsible for its implementation. In this regard, the CPO/PMU will build on the experience and \nexpertise  gained  in  carrying  out  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  on  other  ADB-financed \nprojects.  The  PPMS  will  include  participatory  baseline  surveys  in  each  of  the  irrigation \nsubprojects  shortly  before  commissioning,  and  follow-up  surveys  to  evaluate  changes.  The \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  pro-poor effects of the Project will be integrated into the system. \nBenefits generated during the project period will be measured against these initial data. PPMS \nwork will be eligible for ADB financing under the loan. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n54. \nThe Government, ADB, and AFD will jointly conduct a comprehensive midterm review, in \nconsultation with the project steering committee. The review will examine (i) project progress to \ndate,  including  implementation  of  the  process  of  social  assessment,  mobilization,  quality  of \ndesigns  and  physical  works,  and  initial  benefits;  (ii) future  implementation  plans  and  targets; \n(iii) allocation  of  funds  for  components  and  loan  categories;  (iv) effectiveness  of  the  project \nmanagement structure and implementation arrangements as well as any need for modification; \n(v) the  status  of  institutional  developments;  and  (vi) any  major  environmental,  social,  or \ntechnical,  and  economic  aspects  of  the  Project.  Any  changes  in  project  scope,  financing,  or \nimplementation arrangements deemed necessary will be effected during the period following the \nreview.  In  addition  to  this,  there  will  be  periodic  reviews  to  evaluate  the  general  progress  and \nquality of project performance and to resolve issues affecting the implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nSocial Benefits and Impacts \n\n55. \nBeneficiaries. About 30,200 households (about 169,100 persons) in the three irrigation \nsubproject areas will benefit directly from the Project through increased agriculture income and \nemployment opportunities. In addition, a large number of households will benefit from improved \nsupplies  of  water  for  domestic  and  industrial  use  and  from  improved  salinity  control  in \ndownstream reaches of rivers. \n \n56. \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Gender.  A  large  proportion  (about  39%)  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries  are  below  Viet  Nam\u2019s  national  poverty  line  of  $0.33  per  person  per  day.  This  is \nslightly above the national average of 37%. It is estimated that improved agricultural production \nwill increase average incomes of beneficiaries by about 40%, and that this will at least halve the \nnumber of households that are below the poverty line. The social analysis also confirmed that \nthe burden of poverty in the project area is disproportionately borne by women. About 25% of \nthe  households  are  headed  by  women  and  have  limited  access  to  land  and  credit,  and  have \nmuch lower monthly incomes than male-headed households. Significantly fewer female-headed \nhouseholds derive their main income from agriculture and forestry activities compared to male-\nheaded households, and a much higher proportion derive their main income from wage labor. A \nsocial support program incorporating a gender action plan will be implemented to address these \nissues. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in Appendix 10. \n \n57. \nDisadvantaged  and  Ethnic  Minority  Groups.  Vulnerable  and  disadvantaged  groups \n(poor, landless, elderly, and illiterate) have been identified in the project area, as well as ethnic \nminorities.  These  groups  are  unlikely  to  be  able  to  benefit  either  directly  or  indirectly  from  the \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nProject without assistance. These groups will be assisted to improve employment and income-\nearning  opportunities,  access  to  credit,  and  development  of  new  livelihood  skills  through  the \nsocial  support  program.  The  same  program  will  aim  to  improve  the  health  and  education  of \nthese groups through the provision of reliable domestic water supplies and literacy training. The \nProject  is  not  expected  to  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples, although any adverse \neffects will be addressed under the relevant RP. \n \nB. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n58. \nThe Project will have a number of positive impacts. However, it will also cause significant \nadverse environmental impacts (para. 23), the most significant one being caused by permanent \ninundation upstream of the Phuoc Hoa barrage, and transfer of water out of the Be river basin. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  requirements,  an  EIA  has  been  prepared  which  details  an  EMP  to \nmitigate  the  impacts  to  acceptable  levels.  In  line  with  recommendations  of  the  World \nCommission  on  Dams,25  there  has  been  extensive  public  involvement  and  stakeholder \nconsultations  during  project  preparation.  There  has  also  been  careful  assessment  of  options, \nand  the  proposed  development  is  within  the  framework  of  integrated  basin  management.  The \nmajor  potentially  negative  impacts  and  the  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  set  out  in  the \nfollowing paragraphs. \n \nResettlement.  The  Project  will  cause  significant  involuntary  resettlement  including \n59. \nseverance  of  communities  and  agricultural  activities  as  set  out  in  para.  21.  Land  acquisition \nrequired for the barrage was minimized through careful evaluation of alternate sites to find the \noptimum balance between resettlement, technical issues, and costs; resettlement for the current \nsite is only about one third of earlier sites considered. Canal alignments determined during the \nfeasibility  study  will  be  fine-tuned  and  these  will  be  finalized  during  project  implementation \nthrough  a  participatory  process  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  disruption  to  the  affected \npeople. \n \n60. \nBasin  Transfers.  Reduction  of  flows  in  the  Be  river  downstream  of  the  Phuoc  Hoa \nbarrage as a result of the basin transfers has the potential to affect water quality, aquatic habitat \nand fisheries, riparian irrigators, and salinity levels in the Dong Nai river. These effects can be \nmitigated  by  (i) maintaining  the  recommended  minimum  flow  of  14  m3/s,26  (ii) optimizing \noperation  to  ensure  there  are  no  surplus  basin  transfers,  (iii) comprehensive  water  quality \nmonitoring,  and  (iv) strictly  regulating  polluting  industries.  Studies  will  be  conducted  under  the \nProject  to  determine  the  optimum  management  of  fisheries  to  mitigate  the  affects  associated \nwith construction of the Phuoc Hoa barrage. \n \n61. \nForests and Acid Sulfate Soils. Introduction of irrigation has the potential to increase \npressure on the Lo Go Xe Mat National Park and other forest areas in Tay Ninh Province within \nor  adjacent  to  TBIS.  It  may  also  increase  the  tendency  for  farmer  to  reclaim  acid  sulfate  soils \nadjacent to DHIS that could lead to increased levels of acidity in surrounding waterways if it is \nnot properly  controlled.  Even  though  the  Project  does  not  intend  to  develop  these  sensitive \nareas, it is recognized that introduction of irrigation and intensified farming activities is likely to \nincrease  pressure.  To  mitigate  potential  adverse  effects,  provision  is  made  under  the  EMP  to \n\n________________________  \n25  The  World  Commission  on  Dams.  November  2000.  Dams  and  Development:  A  New  Framework  for  Decision \n\nMaking. Earthscan Publications Ltd., London and Sterling, VA. \n\n26  This  flow  was  determined  from  hydrological  studies  carried  out  as  part  of  the  feasibility  study  which  indicate  that \nnatural dry season flow at the Phuoc Hoa barrage site would rarely fall below 8 m 3/s (i.e., prior to the construction \nof  the  upstream  Thac  Mo  hydropower  reservoir,  which  has  substantially  increased  flows).  Based  on  this,  the \nminimum base flow is set at 10 m 3/s, and a further 4 m 3/s is added to allow for demands of downstream riparian \nirrigators. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f17 \n\nstrengthen protective measures for the national park and forest areas, and the implementation \nof a buffer zone management program in Tan Bien District; strict controls will apply if farmers \nreclaim the acid sulfate soils adjacent to DHIS. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial and Economic Benefits \n\n62. \nQuantified  Benefits  and  Costs.  The  main  quantified  benefits  of  the  Project  are \nincremental outputs of agricultural products from 48,130 ha, primarily rice, maize, groundnuts, \nvegetables,  sugarcane,  and  fruit.  There  will  also  be  incremental  production  of  fish  from  paddy \nfields and ponds. In addition to outputs from land-based activities, water supplied to HCMC for \nDMI use will provide additional benefits. These benefits are balanced by permanent loss of land \nto  be  acquired  for  construction  of  the  project  works  representing  about  7%  of  the  proposed \ncommand area. \n \n63. \nNonquantified  Benefits.  The  Project  will  provide  a  number  of  benefits  that  cannot  be \nreadily quantified. The bulk of fresh water supplies to HCMC are currently drawn from the Dong \nNai  river.  The  Project  will  provide  a  major  alternative  source  from  the  Saigon  river,  which  will \nimprove  the  security  of  supply  for  the  city  by  lessening  the  risk  from  an  event  such  as  gross \ncontamination of the Dong Nai river. Dependence on the already overtaxed groundwater which \nis  now  being  used  to  supply  HCMC  will  also  be  reduced.  In  addition,  the  scheme  will  have \nsufficient capacity to allow the intermittent release of water for salinity control in the Saigon river \nwhile return flows from the new irrigated areas will contribute to a reduction in salinity in both the \nSaigon and Vam Co Dong rivers. Roads to be constructed under the Project will, in some areas, \nprovide  improved  access  for  local  people  and  will  facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and \nservices. \n \n64. \nEconomic  Evaluation.  The  Project  is  economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal \nrate of return (EIRR) of 14.2% for the base case. Sensitivity tests show that the EIRR is most \nsensitive  to  changes  in  investment  costs,  the  timing  of  benefits,  and  price  changes  in \nagricultural outputs. If investment costs rise by 10%, the EIRR falls to 13.5%. A delay in the start \nof  the  benefits  stream  by  a  year  reduces  the  EIRR  to  12.7%.  If  output  prices  fall  by  10%,  the \nEIRR falls to 13.1%. The economic and financial analysis is presented in Appendix 11. \n \nD. \n\nRisks \n\n65. \nThe  main  risks  for  the  Project  arise  from  delays  in  realizing  the  benefit  stream;  its \neconomic viability is quite sensitive to this. One potential cause is project implementation being \ndelayed. Resettlement of people affected by the construction works is on the critical path since \naward of the civil works contracts is conditional upon its prior completion. From past experience, \nit  can  sometimes  be  difficult  to  convince  all  of  the  affected  people  to  quickly  accept \ncompensation and resettlement packages that are offered. Hence, substantial difficulties could \ndelay the award of civil works contracts. To offset this, adequate provision is made to assist with \nresettlement so that plans can be prepared and implemented according to schedule. MARD has \nalso  developed  experience  and  a  good  understanding  of  the  Government\u2019s  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  resettlement  over  recent  years.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  a  strong \ncommitment  to  the  Project,  which  it  considers  particularly  urgent  to  supplement  flows  in  the \nSaigon river for extraction of freshwater supplies for HCMC, and hence there will be incentives \nfor it to quickly resolve any difficulties that arise. \n \n66. \nSlow farmer adoption of irrigated agricultural production systems also has the potential \nto  delay  the  benefits.  The  economic  analysis  assumes  that  the  whole  of  the  target  command \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\narea is converted to irrigated production by the close of the Project or shortly after.27 Any delay \nin the rate of adoption or the ultimate level of adoption achieved would have a significant impact \non  the  EIRR.  Three  factors  are  expected  to  minimize  these  risks.  First,  past  experience \nindicates that farmers will usually respond quickly to increase agriculture activities if they have \naccess  to  water,  and  special  attention  is  given  to  achieving  this  within  the  project  time  frame. \nSecond,  about  half  of  the  area  is  already  being  partially  irrigated  by  farmers\u2019  own  means,  so \nthere is already experience and knowledge of irrigated agriculture. Third, community support is \nto be provided under the Project to help farmers decide cropping systems and become involved \nin  the  design  and  implementation  of  tertiary-level  irrigation  development  from  an  early  stage \n(paras. 19\u201321).  This  support  will  increase  awareness  about  the  potential  project  benefits, \npromote  beneficiary  ownership,  and  thus  encourage  rapid  uptake  by  farmers.  After  the  design \nstage, the emphasis will shift to establishing and training WUGs to manage their tertiary units. \nAgriculture extension services will also be provided under the Project to assist beneficiaries with \ndecisions  about  irrigated  agriculture.  With  this  level  of  support,  a  high  level  of  participation \nshould be assured. \n \nInstitutional capacity to achieve sustainable management of the system is also essential \n67. \nto  ensure  that  project  benefits  are  not  at  risk.  Related  institutional  risks  arise  at  both  the \nimplementation and operational stages.  While  the IAs are well experienced in implementation \nof  the  physical  works,  there  is  limited  experience  in  the  proposed  participatory  and  integrated \napproach  during  implementation.  This  approach  aims  to  lay  the  foundations  for  sustainable \nmanagement through developing end-user ownership. At the operational stage, the responsible \nIMCs  need  to  develop  capacity  as  autonomous  and  accountable  water  service  providers,  with \nemphasis  on  cost  recovery.  This  will  require  review  and  adjustment  of  current  policies, \nstrategies, and regulations relating to irrigation service delivery. Addressing these issues will be \nan important objective of the Project. The Government has committed to establishing a special \ntask force to facilitate participatory preparation of a time-bound proposal for sustainable system \nmanagement  along  the  lines  of  an  indicative  approach  agreed  during  project  appraisal. \nProvision is also made for the consultants and social mobilizors to support these activities.  \n \n68. \nFruit  and  vegetables  are  projected  to  contribute  about  35%  of  the  incremental \nagricultural  value  of  the  Project.  Vegetable  production  is  expected  to  increase  by  over  200%. \nWhile  these  are  large  increases,  they  will  not  be  reached  in  full  until  about  12  years  from  the \ntime  farm  development  commences  in  the  fourth  year  of  the  Project.  However,  there  is  a  risk \nthat  prices  will  fall  unless  urban  incomes  continue  to  rise  and  export  opportunities  are \ndeveloped. This risk will be reduced somewhat through marketing studies to be carried out by \nconsultants to be engaged as part of project support activities. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecial Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \n\n69. \nassurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\nResettlement.  The  Government  will  prepare  (or  update)  a  resettlement  plan \n(RP)  for  each  subproject  and  submit  it  to  ADB  for  approval  before  any  land \nacquisition activities may begin for that subproject. The Government will ensure \nthat  the  subproject  RPs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy on \n\n________________________  \n27 The  economic  analysis  assumes  that  it  will  take  a  further  8  years  after  project  completion  to  obtain  full  crop \n\nproduction targets. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f19 \n\n(ii) \n\nfor \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\nto  ADB \n\nto  conduct \n\nthe  approved  RP \n\nin  accordance  with \n\ninstitution  acceptable \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement and the approved resettlement framework. Prior to the \nstart  of  any  resettlement  activities,  the  Government  will  sign  a  contract  with  a \nqualified \nindependent  external \nmonitoring of resettlement. \nImplementation  of  the  Resettlement  Plans.  The  Government  will  implement \nthe  RPs  for  each  subproject  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB,  including  provision  of \nadequate  counterpart  funding  to  cover  the  actual  costs.  It  will  ensure  that  all \npeople  affected  by  the  Project  are  compensated,  resettled,  and  rehabilitated  in \naccordance with the requirements of the approved RPs, government procedures, \nand ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.  \nConditions for Award of Civil Works Contracts. ADB will not approve of any \ncivil works contract for any subproject unless the Government has satisfactorily \nthat  subproject, \ncompleted, \ncompensation  payment  and  relocation  to  new  sites,  and  ensured rehabilitation \nassistance is in place prior to obtaining possession and rights to the land. In the \ncase of the Phuoc Hoa barrage, affected people in the construction zone will be \nresettled  prior  to  award  of  the  contract,  whereas  resettlement  of  the  people \naffected only by the inundation zone of the barrage may be completed during the \nfirst  phase  of  construction  on  the  condition  that  this  is  completed  before  river \nclosure  commences.  Furthermore,  ADB  will  not  approve  of  any  civil  works \ncontracts  for  the  main  canals  for  any  subproject  unless  the  Government  has \nconfirmed  to  ADB  that  the  Project  provinces  have  undertaken  to  provide  the \nnecessary  funding  to  meet  their  counterpart  obligations  for  tertiary  and  onfarm \ncanals.  \nBe River Water Flow and Quality. To minimize the impact of diversions at the \nPhuoc  Hoa  barrage  on  the  lower  Be  river,  a  minimum  environmental  flow  of \n14 m3/s will be released at all times. The Government will take action to ensure \nthat  effluent  from  polluting  industries  located  along  the  river is treated to meet \ngovernment standards prior to the start of diversions. \nEnvironment. The Government will  submit  an  updated  EMP  for  ADB  and  AFD \napproval  within  12  months  from  loan  effectiveness  and  ensure  that  it  is \nimplemented and monitored to a satisfactory standard. Particular attention will be \ngiven  to  protection  of  the  Lo  Go  Xe  Mat  National  Park  and  forest  areas  in  and \naround  TBIS,  and  reclamation  of  acid  sulfate  soils  for  irrigated  agriculture  in \nDHIS. The CPO/PMU will subcontract a qualified institute acceptable to ADB, to \ncarry out the EMP on its behalf. \nUnexploded Ordnances. An appropriate government agency will be engaged to \nclear all unexploded ordnances for the project work sites prior to the start of any \nconstruction work. \nFuture Operation. MARD will make arrangements acceptable to ADB and AFD \nto manage operations of the Phuoc Hoa Barrage and transfer canal, and expand \nother units as required to manage the main canals of BLIS, TBIS, and DHIS. \n(viii)  System  Management  Task  Force.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness, \nMARD  will  establish  a  task  force,  or  other  similar  group  as  agreed  by  ADB  and \nAFD,  to  facilitate  development  of  sustainable  system  management.  The  task \nforce  will  be  chaired  by  the  vice-minister  in  MARD  responsible  for  system \nmanagement,  and  comprise  representatives  of  the  relevant  departments  within \nMARD, the provinces, and other ministries and agencies as appropriate. \nSustainable System Management. Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the \ntask  force  set  up  to  facilitate  sustainable  system  management,  with  the \nassistance of the consultants, will prepare a comprehensive time-bound proposal \nfor  addressing  the  related  issues  as  set  out  in  the  indicative  approach  to \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n(x) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nsustainable system management agreed during loan appraisal,28 and submit it for \nthe approval of MARD, ADB, and AFD. In keeping with this, the Government will \nensure there is adequate funding to complete the tertiary irrigation canals. \nSocial  Aspects.  During  project  implementation,  the  interests  of  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  groups,  especially  women  and  ethnic  groups,  will  be  taken  into \naccount  through  implementation  of  the  agreed  social  support  program  and \ngender action plan.  \n\nConditions for Loan Signing and Effectiveness \n\nIt  was  agreed  that  World  Bank  board  approval  of  VWRAP  will  be  a  condition  for  loan \n\n70. \nsigning, and for loan effectiveness the following conditions will apply: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  have  obtained  confirmation  that  project  cofinancing  from \nAFD has been approved. \nMONRE has approved the environmental impact assessment.  \nThe Government will provide confirmation that a project steering committee has \nbeen established; and that staff for the PMU (sub-office of CPO based in HCMC) \nhave  been  appointed  and  mobilized,  and  confirm  that  a  senior  staff  of  PMB416 \nand  each  of  the  PPMBs  have  been  appointed  to  undertake  project  activities  as \nagreed with ADB. \nThe  Government  will  confirm  that  MARD  has  issued  guidance  to  the  Project \nprovinces  to  apply  MARD's  participatory  irrigation  management  approach  under \nthe Project. \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n71. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 63,042,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Phuoc  Hoa \nWater Resources Project, from ADB\u2019s Special  Funds resources with  an  interest  charge  at the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5%  per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n\n________________________  \n28 The  relevant  issues  agreed  during  loan  appraisal,  which  incorporate  a  policy  of  cost  recovery  for  operation  and \n\nmaintenance, are set out in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n\n \n \n30 October 2003 \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nVerifiable Indicators \n\nMeans of Verification \n\nAssumptions/Risks \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSector Goals \n \nSustainable growth of the \nrural, urban, and industrial \nareas in Ho Chi Minh City \n(HCMC) and surrounding \nprovinces in accordance \nwith the regional master \nplan. \n \n\nReduction of rural poverty \nand increased \nemployment opportunities  \nthrough the provision of \nreliable irrigation. \n \nPurpose \n\nTo provide additional \nwater supplies in the \nSaigon and VCD river \nbasins for irrigation, DMI, \nsalinity control, and assure \nefficient and sustainable \nmanagement of the overall \nwater resources .  \n\nComponents/ \nOutputs \n \nPart A:  Support for \nIntegrated Development \n \nA.1.

To help reduce income \ndisparities  between  the  rural  and  urban  populations,  the  Government  is  placing  increased \nemphasis  on  rural  development  to  improve  incomes.  As  part  of  this  strategy,  high  priority  is \nbeing placed on investments in water resource infrastructure to increase agricultural productivity \nand reduce rural poverty. Since 1996, the Government has spent about $120 million annually on \nupgrading the country\u2019s irrigation and drainage systems and on constructing new schemes. \n \nViet  Nam  has  a  long  history  of  water  management  that  has  developed  in  response  to \n2. \nwater shortages during the dry season, a monsoon climate that regularly causes extensive flood \ndamage,  and  a  need  to  intensify  agricultural  production.  Irrigation,  drainage,  and  flood  control \nhave  traditionally  been  the  main  focus of water sector development with less than 1% of total \nwater resources used to meet municipal and industrial demands. The Government strategies for \nthe  water  sector  have  evolved  significantly  in  recent  years.  Past  sector  plans  were  largely \nsupply-driven  and  mainly  focused  on  investment  targets  that  were  determined  at  the  central \nlevel. The Government\u2019s current approach is more demand-based and a start has been made \non adopting integrated water resources planning in river basins. \n \nB. \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management \n\nTo  address  the  sector  constraints,  the  Government  has  introduced  reforms  and  is \n3. \ndeveloping  new  policies  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  management  and  use  of  water.  Most \nsignificant in this process was the adoption of the Water Resources Law (WRL) in 1998. Under \nthe  WRL,  the  National  Water  Resources  Council  was  established  in  2000  to  advise  on  water \nresource  management  issues  for  the  country  as  a  whole.  River  basin  organizations  are  being \nestablished  for  water  resource  planning  for  large  rivers  such  as  the  Red,  Mekong,  and  Dong \nNai, together with a system of water abstraction rights and wastewater discharge permits, public \ninformation,  and  supporting  measures  to  improve  water  resources  management.  In November \n2002,  the  Government  took  another  important  step  by  separating  the  functions  of  water \nresource management from water service delivery. The water resource management functions \nare  now  being  carried  out  by  the  newly  established  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment (MONRE) while the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  has \nretained the service delivery functions. \n \n4. \nThe  institutional,  organizational,  and  regulatory  aspects  of  the  WRL  will  involve \nsignificant  changes  in  interagency  and  basin  coordination  at  the  national, provincial, and local \nlevels,  and  in  stakeholder  participation.  Further,  the  river  basin  organizations  and  irrigation \nmanagement  companies  (IMCs)  will  have  increased  responsibilities  for  management,  and  for \ntechnical  and  financial  operation  of  the  systems.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) water policy which focuses on establishing an effective policy, legal and regulatory, \nand  institutional  environment  to  implement  efficient  water  resource  investments  in  river  basins \nand  for  water  service  delivery  investments  using  accountable  and  autonomous  service \nproviders. In Viet Nam, the ADB country strategy in the sector supports implementation of the \nnew government policy. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nC. \n\nIrrigation Service Delivery \n\n5. \nAt  present,  more  than  2.6 million  ha  of agricultural land  are  irrigated  through 75 large \nand  medium-scales  schemes  and  thousands  of  small-scale  systems.  These  systems  are \nmanaged  by  173  state-owned  IMCs  and  by  thousands  of  agricultural  cooperatives  and  water \nuser  groups  (WUGs).  The  IMCs  serve  about  63%  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  area.  Irrigation \nservice fees are high in Viet Nam compared with the other countries in the region. On average, \nthe  fees  are  about  220  kg  of  paddy/ha/crop,  representing  8\u201310%  of  the  crop  yield.  This  is \nequivalent to about $46/ha for systems with double cropping. Such high fees are even applied \nfor  small  run-of-river  gravity  schemes.  Besides  the  fees,  IMCs  received  subsidies  from  the \ncentral  and  provincial  governments  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  In  1995-1996, \nirrigation  fees  covered  56\u201360%  of  the  total  O&M  cost.  The  present  fee  structure  and  the \nsubsidies do not provide an incentive for the IMCs to improve their performance, nor for farmers \nto use irrigation supplies efficiently. \n \n6. \nThe  Government  estimates  that  the  country\u2019s  irrigation  systems  realize  only  about  50-\n60% of the design targets as a result of a number of constraints that limit performance. These \ninclude  (i) degraded  or  inadequate  irrigation  infrastructure  (especially  at  farm  level),  (ii) weak \ninstitutional  capacity  to  manage  the  systems,  and  (iii) inadequate  integration  of  agricultural \nextension to development cropping systems. This low performance contributes to rural poverty, \nwith the effect most severely felt by poor households at the tail end of irrigation systems. \n \n7. \nThe  effects  of  inadequate  farm  level  development  are  a  significant  contributor  to  low \nperformance of systems. An example is the situation in the Dau Tieng irrigation system where a \nsignificant  portion  of  the  target  area  is  not  properly  serviced  by  gravity  supplies,  even  after \nalmost  20  years  of  operation,  because  the  lower-level  canals  were  never  constructed.  This  is \ncaused  by  an  implementation  approach  that  does  not  emphasize  onfarm  development  during \nproject  implementation,  and  does  not  formally  allocate  funding  for  this  work.  Project  funding \nfrom  central  level  usually  only  covers  the  major  works.  This  is  on  the  understanding  that \nprovincial governments will fund the onfarm work, although in practice, it is not usually executed \nduring project implementation because provinces rarely have funds at the time. Provinces make \nefforts  to  gradually  execute  the  work,  although  funding  tends  to  be  on  a  limited  and  ad  hoc \nbasis,  and  even  if  the  work  is  eventually  executed,  it  becomes  a  long  and  inefficient process. \nLessons learned from this highlight the need to complete the total irrigation system down to farm \nlevel during initial implementation to ensure that benefits are realized. \n \nA new strategy is needed to improve system performance in Viet Nam. Hence, policies \n8. \non  water  service  delivery  have  shifted  to  a  more  decentralized  and  participatory  approach, \nparticularly  for  irrigation  and  drainage  services.  The  Government  policy  now  is  to  promote \nautonomy  for  the  IMCs  and  to  strengthen  the  WUGs  at  the local level. Some provinces have \nstarted  to  transfer  O&M  of  smaller  systems  to  local  authorities  and  WUGs.  This  will  require  a \nmove  away  from  the  present  strategy  to  implement  or  improve  irrigation  with  a  heavily \nsubsidized  engineering  approach.  This  does  not  encourage  the  adoption  of  a  more  holistic \napproach  whereby  IMCs  have  an  incentive  to  pursue  nonphysical  interventions  to  improve \nsystem  management  nor  to  introduce  O&M  approaches  that  minimize  the  need  for \nrehabilitation. Such improvements require  that a set of monitorable performance targets related \nto better service delivery and increased agriculture production be developed. Outright subsidies \nshould be minimized in favor of a system of matching funds so that interventions proposed will \nbenefit the majority of the end-users. Farmers and their WUGs should be able to borrow money \nfor financing their share of the cost for the improvement works. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nEXTERNALLY ASSISTED MAJOR PROJECTS IN THE WATER RESOURCES SECTOR  \n\nPrograms/Projectsa \n\n \nSecond Red River Sector Project, Loan 1855 \n\nAmount \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n100,000 \n10,600 \n \n3,800 \n\nType \n \n\n \nLoans \nGrant \n \nTA \n\nSource \n \n\n \nADB, AFD \n NET \n \nADB, NET \n\n \nGrant \n \nGrant \n\n \n12,900 \n \n5,400 \n\n \nAusAID \n \nAusAID \n\n \nCapacity Building for Water Resources Management \nProject, TA 3528 \n \nNorth Vam Nao Flood Control Project \n \nViet Nam Water Resources Management Assistance \nProject \n \nWater Sector Support Program \n \nPhan Ri  - Phan Tiet Irrigation Project \n \nGroundwater Development in Northern Provinces \n \nLower Ayun Irrigation Project \n \nMekong Delta Water Resources Development Project \n \nIrrigation Rehabilitation Project \n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AFD  =  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development, Danida = Danish International Development Agency,  JBIC = Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, JICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, NET = The Netherlands, TA = technical assistance. \na \n\n \nDanida \n \nJBIC \n \nJICA \n \nKuwait \n \nWorld Bank \n \nWorld Bank \n \n\n \n13,270b \n \n56,300 \n \n7,225 \n \n16,500 \n \n101,800 \n \n100,000 \n \n\n \nGrant \n \nLoan \n \nGrant \n \nLoan \n \nLoan \n \nLoan \n \n\nIncludes projects ongoing as of 30 June 2003. \nThis amount does not include the water supply subcomponents. \n\nb \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\n1. \nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project will require land acquisition \nfor  the  reservoir  and  access  roads,  the  transfer  canal,  the  main  canals,  the  primary  and \nsecondary  canals  (from  the  main  canals  to  the  irrigated  areas),  and  for  onfarm  canals  (from \nsecondary canals to farmers\u2019 plots). Land acquisition requirements for the reservoir have been \nminimized  through  careful  selection  of  project  alternatives.  Land  acquisition  will  be  further \nminimized through participatory design of canal alignments. Table A4.1 presents the breakdown \nof land acquisition impacts estimated for each subproject. A total of 2,173 households (11,138 \npersons) will be affected by land acquisition. The total land to be permanently acquired will be \n3,153 hectares (ha).  Some land will be required also for temporary use during the construction \nperiod.  It is estimated that 1,009 households will be severely affected by the permanent loss of \nagricultural land, and  453 households will lose their houses and will need to be relocated. Only \n21 shops or small businesses attached to houses will need to be relocated. \n \n2. \nScope  of  the  Resettlement  Plan  and  Framework.  As  part  of  project  preparation,  a \nsocial analysis was carried out in the project areas. A census and inventory of lost assets was \ncarried out for the barrage, reservoir, and transfer and main canals, and estimates were made \nof  land  acquisition  impacts  of  the  primary  and  secondary  canals  of  the  three  irrigation \nsubprojects.  A  household  socioeconomic  survey  was  conducted  on  a  sample  of  25%  of  the \nreservoir-affected  persons  and  group  interviews  were  conducted  in  eight  out  of  the  total  of  34 \nproject communes. Based on the information collected, a resettlement plan has been prepared \nfor  the  Project  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  the \nHandbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  The  resettlement  plan  will  be  updated \nfollowing detailed design during project implementation. \n \n3. \nA census and inventory of losses for the primary and secondary canals of the subproject \nirrigation systems will be dependent upon community participation to select the alignment and, \nas  such,  can  only  be  done  during  project  implementation.  To  guide  preparation  of  subproject \nresettlement  plans  for  the  Binh  Long,  Tan  Bien,  and  Duc  Hoa  primary  and  secondary canals, \ntherefore,  a  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared,  also  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy \non  Involuntary  Resettlement. For the development of tertiary and onfarm systems, the Project \nwill  facilitate  a  system  of  equitable  contribution  of  land and labor by farmers within water user \ngroups. The farmers will be responsible for contributing land and labor to build small canals over \ntheir land, for which a resettlement plan is not required. \n \nPolicy  Framework  and  Entitlements.  The  policy  framework  and  entitlements  for  the \n4. \nProject  have  built  upon  Vietnamese  laws,  principally  the  1993  Land  Law,  amended  in  2001, \nDecree  22/CP  (1998),  Decree  87/CP  (1994),  and  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995).  With  the  promulgation  of  Decree  22/CP  (24  April  1998),  the  Government  issued \nlegislation  regarding  resettlement,  which  approaches  the  principles  of  ADB's  policy.  However, \nprovisions  and  principles  adopted  in  the  resettlement  plan  for  the  Project  supersede  the \nprovisions of the relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists. \n \n5. \n \n\nProject Principles. The following basic principles have been adopted for the Project: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  principal  objective  of  ADB's  policy  and  the  resettlement  plan  (RP)  and \nresettlement  framework  is  to  ensure  that  populations  affected  by  the  Project \nshould be at least as well off, if not better off, than they would have been without \nthe  Project.  Affected  populations  should  be  able  to  maintain  and  preferably \nimprove their standard of living and quality of life. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n29\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe populations affected by the Project are defined as those who may stand to \nlose,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Project,  all  or  part  of  physical  and  nonphysical \nassets, including homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, \ntenancy, \nincome-earning  opportunities,  social  and  cultural  activities  and \nrelationships, as well as other losses that may be identified during the process of \nresettlement planning. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  minimized  by  identifying  possible  alternative \nproject  designs,  and  appropriate  social,  economic,  operational,  and  engineering \nsolutions that have the least impact on populations in the project area. \nA census and detailed measurement survey and baseline socioeconomic survey \nwill  be  carried  out  for  all  irrigation  subprojects  after  detailed  design  of  each \nsubproject and in preparation of an RP for each subproject. \nThe  cut-off  date  for  compensation  eligibility  for  physical  assets  affected  by  the \nbarrage,  reservoir,  and  transfer  and  main  canals  will  be  the  date  of  the \ncompletion  of  the  census  and  the  detailed  measurement  survey  after  detailed \ndesign  has  been  completed  for  these  components.  Affected  people  and  local \ncommunities  will  be  informed  of  the  cut-off  date  for  each  Project  component. \nPeople moving into the area impacted  upon the project component after the cut-\noff date will not be entitled to compensation and assistance under the Project. \nAll project-affected people will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets, \nincomes, and businesses at full replacement cost and provided with rehabilitation \nmeasures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least restore their pre-project \nliving standards, income levels, and productive capacity. \n\nfor  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the \nobjectives outlined above. \nIn the case of population relocation, efforts shall be made for the existing social \nand  cultural  institutions  of  the  people  being  resettled  and  host  community  to  be \nmaintained to the extent possible. \nPreparation  of  RPs  (as  part  of  subproject  preparation)  and  their  implementation \nare to be carried out with the full participation of affected people. \nAdequate  budgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  be  made  available  to \ncover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement and rehabilitation within the \nagreed implementation period.  \nADB shall not approve any civil works contract for any subproject to be financed \nfrom the loan proceeds unless the Government has completed satisfactorily and \nin accordance with the approved RP for that subproject compensation payment \nand relocation to new sites, and ensured rehabilitation assistance is in place prior \nto obtaining possession and rights to the land. The exception is the Phuoc Hoa \nbarrage  where  construction  of  the  barrage  may  commence  (in  an  off-river \nlocation)  before  clearing  the  upstream  inundation.  This  area  will  be  cleared \nbefore permitting the contractor to close the natural flow of the river. \n\n(vii)  All  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible \n\n(xii)  Detailed  RPs  for  implementation  will  be  translated  into  the  local  language  and \nplaced  in  project  and  commune  offices  for  the  reference  of  affected  people  as \nwell as any interested groups. \n\n(xiii)  Appropriate  reporting,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  mechanisms  will  be  identified \nand set in place as part of the resettlement management system. Monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  land  acquisition  process  and  the  final  outcome  will  be \nconducted independently of the Executing Agency. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nParticipatory  Process  of  Resettlement  Planning  and \n\nEntitlement  Matrix.  The  project  entitlements  were  designed  to  cover  compensation, \n6. \nresettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for  lost  assets  and  restore  or  enhance  the  livelihoods  of  all \ncategories (directly and indirectly affected, titleholders and non-titleholders) of affected people. \nThe  entitlement  matrix  for  the  Project  summarizes  the  main  types  of  losses  and  the  support \nentitled for each type of loss. \n \n7. \nEthnic Minorities and Disadvantaged Groups. The social analysis shows that 2% of \nthe population in the project area are ethnic minorities, and although there are some pockets of \nconcentration, they are generally integrated into the larger population. Special attention will be \ngiven  to  identifying  and  addressing  the  special  needs  of  this  group  plus  other disadvantaged \ngroups such as the landless, poor, women-headed households, the disabled, and war veterans. \nThey will be assisted through the project\u2019s Social Support Program under Component A2. \n \n8. \nResettlement  Strategy.  Households  that  have  to  relocate  will  participate  in  identifying \nand selecting options for government assistance to move to either group or individual relocation \nsites or to receive cash compensation and make their own arrangements for relocation. \n \n9. \nIncome Restoration. Agricultural households who are severely affected through loss of \nmore than 20% of productive assets will be assisted to purchase replacement land or increase \nproductivity on remaining land, or learn new income-generating skills through the Social Support \nProgram. Businesses will be assisted to relocate to viable new sites. \n \n10. \nImplementation,  and \nGrievance Mechanism. There was an extensive consultative process during the social analysis \nand  resettlement  planning  period  of  the  feasibility  study.  Resettlement  planning  and  RP \npreparation  and  implementation  during  project  implementation  will  follow  the  Project\u2019s \nparticipatory approach using facilitators to mobilize the affected and beneficiary communities to \nparticipate  in  alignment  selection  and  design,  inventory  of  losses  and  socioeconomic  survey, \nvalidation of compensation rates and entitlements, delivery of entitlements, design and delivery \nof the Social Support Program to disadvantaged and severely affected households, monitoring \nof impacts and benefits, and design and participation in a grievance mechanism. \n \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  Affected  people  will  be  organized  by  the  implementing \n11. \nagencies  (departments  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  [DARDs]),  under  guidance of the \nconsultants,  to  participate  in  alignment  selection  and  design,  inventory  of  losses,  and \nresettlement  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  The  intention  is  to  make  resettlement \npart  of  the  participatory  approach  that  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the  Project.  This  will  be \nclosely linked to the social mobilization activities under Component A2. \n \n12.  Monitoring  of  Resettlement  Planning \nImpacts.  The \nimplementing agencies will be responsible for internal monitoring of the RPs and the impacts. A \nqualified  independent  agency  such  as  a  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  or  social  science \ninstitute  will  be  contracted  for  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  process \nand impacts. Findings will be regularly fed back into management decisions. \n \n13. \nCost  Estimates.  The  estimated  base  cost  for  resettlement  planning,  RP  preparation, \nimplementation,  management  and  monitoring  for  the  RP  of  the  barrage,  reservoir  area,  and \nmain  and  transfer  canals  is  $10.7 million.  The  estimated  base  cost  of  the  three  irrigation \nsubprojects  is  $7.5 million.

This will be the main task of the consultants\u2019 core management \nteam  (team  leader  and  deputy  team  leader).  It  will  require  establishing  efficient  working \nrelationship  with  the  central  and  provincial  agencies  directly  and  indirectly  involved  in \nimplementation of the Project under the guidance of the project consultative committee and the \nproject  steering  committee.  The  team  will  also  need  to  seek  synergies  between  the  project \nactivities  and  programs  being  undertaken  by  nonproject  agencies  (government  and \nnongovernment) \nthe  Project\u2019s  agriculture \ntransformation  strategy.  Furthermore,  the  core  management  team  will  assist  in  introducing \nmechanisms  for  sustainable  management  of  the  Dau  Tieng-Phuoc  Hoa  system  (paras.  17 \nand 18). \n \n4. \nMonitoring  Project  Performance.  As  part  of  the  project  management  role,  the \nconsultants will assist to establish the project performance management system (PPMS). This \nwill include assisting IMCs and WUGs to monitor and evaluate implementation of their agreed \noperation  plans,  identify  performance  constraints,  and  formulate  and  implement  practical \nremedial  measures.  Annual  performance  evaluations  will  be  conducted  as  a  basis  for  refined \noperation planning, and assessments of the project impacts on poverty. \n \nB. \n\nPreparatory Activities \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthe \n\nThe consultants will undertake a comprehensive review of the Project\u2019s feasibility study \n5. \nreport  and  other  relevant  background  documents  including  those  pertaining  to  the  Irrigation \nModernization  Component  of  VWRAP.  The  following  aspects  require  attention, particularly at \nthe  farm  and  tertiary  levels:  water  balance  estimates,  land  capability,  farming  and  irrigation \nsystems,  target  groups,  existing  institutional  arrangements,  and  proposed  improvements  for \nefficient  water  management  along  hydraulic  boundaries.  In  particular,  the  feasibility  study \nadvocates  the  ADB-financed  technical  assistance  pilot  work  in  Nghe  An  and  Thanh  Hoa \nprovinces as a successful institutional and participatory model for emulation under the Project. \n\n________________________  \n1  These reports will include, among others, quarterly progress reports and the project completion report. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n44\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nThe  consultants  will  review  water  balance  projections  from  the  perspective  of  future \n6. \ncropping  and  irrigation  systems,  and  prepare  tentative  operation  plans  for  dissemination  to \nfarmers  as  a  basis  for  their  informed  collective  decision  making.  Indicative  considerations \ninclude  water  requirements  for  different  crops  under  different  conditions  and  soil  types.2 The \nsupply  of  irrigation  for  fruit  trees  and  vegetables  by  repumping  canal  seepage  losses,  and \npractical  alternatives  for  irrigating  extensive  areas  of  grain  legumes  at  night  will  also  be \nconsidered. \n \nBased on the above considerations, the consultants will prepare a technical design brief \n7. \nprior  to  commencement  of  detailed  design  for  irrigation  development  in  the  three  irrigation \nsubprojects of Binh Long, Tan Bien, and Duc Hoa. The  design and specifications for irrigation \ndevelopment of these three areas will be in accordance with international practice and based on \nthe  criteria  used  in  the  Project\u2019s  feasibility  study  where  appropriate.  The  design  brief  will \ndescribe proposed criteria and technical specifications and highlight any areas where these may \ndeviate from current Vietnamese standards. The criteria should include revised canal capacities, \nparticularly  of  tertiary  and  secondary  canals.  On  this  basis,  an  implementation  manual  setting \nout  integrated  technical  procedures  for  a  participatory  design  process  should  be  prepared \n(para. 9). \n \nC. \n\nSupport for Integrated Development and Management \n\n1. \n\nOnfarm and Social Development3 \n\n8. \nThe  consultants  will  assist  the  DARDs  to  implement  an  integrated  program  for \ncommunity  mobilization,  agricultural  and  social  support,  and  organizing  farmers  in  water  user \ngroups  (WUGs)\u2014the  onfarm  and  social  development  program  (OSDP).  The  OSDP  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  PPMBs  in  association  with  other  DARD  organizations  and  the  provincial \nIMCs  through  local  organizations  (such  as  social  science  institutes  or  NGOs)4  and  local \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  arrange  and  provide  training,  technical  assistance,  and \nmonitoring. \n \n9. \nTo  develop  the  OSDP  in  each  of  the  three  irrigation  subprojects,  the  consultants  will \nundertake a participatory diagnosis of farmer\u2019s production constraints and cultural practices that \ninfluence farmer decisions about cropping patterns and calendars, and their ability to cooperate \nin  onfarm  water  management  through  WUGs.  The  diagnosis  will  also  identify  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups  and  their  specific  needs.  Based  on  the  diagnosis,  the  consultants  will \ndevelop: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPackages  for  agriculture  and  social  support,  and  identify  agencies  that  can  be \nassociated with the implementation of these packages. \nA  process  to  establish  WUGs  and  model  regulations  to  clarify  the  role  of  the \nWUG  in  the  design  of  the  tertiary  canal  system  and  its  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n\n________________________  \n2  This will include water requirements for rice percolation losses versus realistic operational losses and efficiencies to \n\naccommodate tertiary rotations for intermittent irrigation of crops other than rice. \n\n3  Onfarm development includes the construction of tertiary canal infrastructure and the lower order (farm) distribution \n\nsystem, and investments by individual farmers (e.g. tubewells, perenial crops, etc). \n\n4   The organizations will have a proven track record in large-scale social mobilization and community development. \nSelection  will  take  into  consideration  attitudes  and  values  of  the  candidate  organizations,  as  well  as  form al \nqualifications and experience. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n45\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA  model  contract  between  the  WUG  and  the  IMC  for  the  delivery  of  irrigation \nsupplies. \nProcedures for field-testing methodologies and processes for the implementation \nof the OSDP during a pilot phase after which an implementation manual will be \nprepared.  The  implementation  manual  will  be  revised  regularly  during  project \nimplementation to incorporate the experiences and lessons learned. \n\n \n10. \nThe  consultants  will  prepare  TOR  and  output-based  service  contracts  for  the  local \norganizations that will assist the PPMBs to implement the OSDP, and assist in their recruitment. \nUpon deployment of the organizations, the consultants will arrange training of the PPMBs and \nthe  organizations\u2019  field  staff,  and  provide  technical  assistance  and  on-the-job  training  during \nimplementation  of  the  program.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  the  PPMBs  to  monitor  the \nperformance of the local institutions. \n \n11. \nThe  consultants  will  assist  the  PPMBs  and  their  locally  subcontracted  consultants  to \nadopt  a  fully  participatory  approach  for  the  design  and  construction  of  the  tertiary  canals. \nSpecific tasks will be to: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDevelop  a  process  to  design  and  construct  the  tertiary  system  with  the  full \nparticipation of the WUGs. It is proposed that this will involve the tertiary systems \nbeing constructed by the WUGs with materials for the structures supplied by the \nProject, and the PPMBs (and their consultants) providing technical assistance. \nReview the available topographic, cadastral, soils, and land capability information \nand  recommend  mapping  standards  to  facilitate  the  participatory  layout  and \ndesign of the irrigation system. This will allow identification of suitable small-scale \nreservoir sites for night storage (if needed), and preparation of preliminary canal \nsystem  layouts  (including  tertiary  units),  for  refinement  and  agreement  during \nfarmer walk-throughs and subsequent participatory design. \nDevelop  arrangements  for  the  participation  of  the  WUGs  in  the  design  of  the \nprimary  and  secondary  canal  systems.  This  will  be  confined  to  adjusting \npreliminary canal and drain routes selected by the PPMB  engineers to minimize \ncompensation  and  resettlement  requirements  and  disruption \nto  existing \nlandholdings.

These  will  include,  among  other  things,  tertiary \nrotations to facilitate intermittent irrigation of extensive grain legumes and efficient land soaking \nfor the first wet season rice crops. \n \n14. \nWUGs to: \n \n\nFor each of the three irrigation subareas, the consultants will assist provincial IMCs and \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ndevelop  performance  objectives  at  the  tertiary  as  well  as  at  the  higher-order \ncanals under the management of the IMC; \nbased  on  the  performance  objectives,  jointly  develop  an  operation  plan  for \ncoordinated water delivery schedules to optimize utilization of the available water \nresources and the farmers\u2019 land, labor and management resources; \n\n(iii)  monitor  and  evaluate \n\nimplementation  of \n\nidentify \nperformance  constraints,  and  formulate  and  implement  practical  remedial \nmeasures; and \nconduct annual performance evaluations with the participation of the WUGs as a \nbasis for refined operation planning. \n\ntheir  operation  plans, \n\n(iv) \n\n \n15. \nBaseline and Follow-Up Surveys. The consultants will assist the IMCs to design and \nfacilitate  participatory  baseline  surveys  in  tertiary  units  during  the  year  prior  to  their \ncommissioning.5 The surveys are intended to further stimulate demand, accelerate adoption of \nagricultural  transformation,  and  provide  a  platform  for  subsequent  WUG  participation  in \noperation  planning  and  system  management.  Upon  commissioning  of  the  systems,  follow-up \nsurveys will be conducted to monitor project benefits and evaluate impacts. Special attention will \nbe  given  during  the  design  of  the  surveys  to  ensure  that  project  impacts  on  the  poor  are \ncaptured, including quantitative and qualitative assessments of the levels and nature of poverty \nand vulnerability. \n \n16. \nSocial  Support.  The  consultants  and  community  mobilizors  will  assist  the  IAs  to \ndevelop  a  participatory  social  support  program  for  disadvantaged  and  vulnerable  groups, \nbuilding on the program outlined in the feasibility study.

Sustainable  management  of  this  system  is  a  prerequisite  for \nrealizing and sustaining the projected increase in agriculture production and a reliable supply of \nwater to nonagricultural users.6 To achieve this, the consultants will assist MARD and the IMCs \nto: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ndevelop  and  operationalize  sustainable  management  of  the  entire  System  by \ndefining its overall multisector management objectives and develop performance \nstandards (and associated indicators) to achieve these objectives; \noptimize  the  use  of  the  available  water  resources  against  changing  water \ndemands during the next 7\u201310 years;7 \ndevelop a resource-based management plan for each of the IMCs based on the \nSystem\u2019s overall objectives; \nimplement the management plan through development of management systems \nso that it can be readily put into operation within the IMCs; and \ndraw  up  new  service  delivery  contracts  between  IMCs  within  the  System  and \nbetween IMCs and nonagricultural bulk water users. \n\n \n18. \nThe  consultants  will  support  the  task  force  to  be  set  up  to  guide  the  process  of \ndeveloping the System\u2019s overall management objectives and the management plans for the Dau \nTieng  IMC  and  the  provincial  IMCs.  Discussion  papers  on  issues  will  be  prepared  for \nconsideration and further guidance by the concerned departments within MARD, the provincial \npeople\u2019s committees, and when needed also from other government agencies. \n \n\n3.  \n\nResettlement \n\n19. \nThe  consultant  will  assist  the  PMU,  PMB416,  and  the  PPMBs  to  provide  overall \nplanning, coordination, and supervision of the resettlement program, and establish project-wide \nconsistent procedures for planning, implementing, and monitoring resettlement activities. These \nshould  be  integrated  into  the  holistic  participatory  agricultural  transformation  process  to  be \nimplemented  within  the  three  irrigation  service  areas.  There  are  two  distinct  target  groups: \n(i) those  adversely  affected  by  construction  of  the  barrage,  transfer  and  main  canals,  and \nimpoundment  of  the  reservoir,  and  (ii) irrigation  beneficiaries  along  the  main,  primary,  and \nsecondary canal routes. Both target groups will require compensation, relocation, and income \nrestoration.  However,  relocation  of  irrigation  beneficiaries  will  be  minimized  as  there  is  some \nflexibility in locating the final alignment of canals, which is to be done in a participatory way to \nminimize disruption to landholdings and property and minimize resettlement requirements. The \n________________________  \n6   Sustainable  management  within  the  project  context  is  defined  as  local  irrigation  institutions  (IMCs  and  WUGs) \nbeing able to provide water delivery services against agreed performance indicators to all users without having to \nresort to major rehabilitation interventions. \n\n7 The rehabilitation and modernization of DTIS under VWRAP will result in the service area being extended, and thus \nincrease water demands from the IMCs. Water demands from domestic, industrial, and urban water users are also \nexpected to increase. It is also expected that adjustments will be needed in reservoir releases for salinity control \nand environmental management purposes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n48\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nconsultant shall also provide formal and on-the-job training and capacity building in resettlement \nand  social  assessment  for  the  PMU, \nIAs,  resettlement  committees,  community-based \norganizations, and the external monitoring organization.  \n \nThe consultant shall guide and assist the IAs, resettlement committees, and community-\n20. \nbased  organizations  to  update  the  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  the  main  components  after \ndetailed design, and to implement the approved RP.

The specific \naspects covered under the advance detailed design that require review are: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nbenchmark  controls  and  detailed  topographic  surveys  of  the  three  irrigation \nsystems  with  spot  levels  taken  on  a  50  m  grid  and  data  digitized  to  facilitate \nsubsequent  contour  mapping  including  provincial  cadastral  and  soil  data \nwherever available; \nhydraulic  modeling  of  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage  with  the  model  maintained  in  full \nworking order to facilitate further testing following loan approval; \ncontour plans of the reservoir site at a scale of 1:1,000;  \ntransfer  and  main  canal  strip  surveys,  cadastral  mapping,  plotting  of  cross \nsections  (1:200  scale)  and \nlong  sections  (1:2,000  vertically  and  1:200 \nhorizontally);   \ngeotechnical investigations of the barrage site and canal alignments; and \npreparation of preliminary construction drawings, with sufficient detail for bidding, \nand preliminary technical specifications in both Vietnamese and English. \n\n \nOn the basis of the review, the consultants will finalize the detailed engineering designs, \n23. \ncost estimates, and tender documents for bidding and construction purposes.8 The design of the \nheadworks  will  incorporate  the  results  of  the  hydraulic  modeling  of  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage \nundertaken  during  advanced  detailed  design,  with  further  tests  undertaken  as  deemed \nnecessary by the consultants. The specifications will be based on international standards for all \nitems  of  work.  A  design  report  shall  be  prepared  in  adequate  detail  to  explain  the  design \nrationale and methodology. These will follow standard quality assurance  procedures. Quantities \nshall be calculated for all items and included in the bill of quantities. Specific items include: \n \n\n(i) \n\nindividual  designs  of  major  hydraulic  structures  shown  on  separate  drawings, \nwith typical drawings prepared for smaller structures suc h as bridges; \nseparate reinforcement drawings in sufficient detail to indicate bar locations; and \n\n(ii) \n(iii)  mechanical and electrical drawings indicating the general arrangement (detailed \nshop drawings to be prepared by the mechanical/ electrical subcontractors). \n\n________________________  \n8  As it is not possible to estimate the resources needed to finalize the designs and tender documents, the consulting \n\ncontract will include a provision for unallocated specialists. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n50\n\nAppendix 9 \n\nThe consultants will assist in the preparation of prequalification documents together with \n24. \nevaluation criteria. All procurement documents will be prepared on the basis of ADB guidelines \nand  sample  documents  for  ICB  procurement.  The  consultants  will  assist  the  PMB416  in  the \nprequalification of contractors and the bid evaluation following ADB guidelines. \n \n\n2. \n\nConstruction \n\n25. \nThe  consultants  will  assist  PMB416  to  manage  and  supervise  the  contractors.  As  the \nengineer,  the  consultants  will  ensure  timely  progress  of  the  works,  enforce  specified  materials \nand  workmanship  requirements,  and  control  the  quality  of  construction.  This  includes \nassessment  of  programs,  materials,  labor,  construction  methods,  and  monitoring  compliance \nwith  specified  construction  methods, \nincludes \nsupervision  of  contractor\u2019s  programs,  rates  of  progress,  performance  testing,  compliance  with \nspecifications and drawings, health, safety, and environmental requirements.

It  will  involve  building  capacity  within  the  IMCs  to  manage  the  project  facilities. \nCommissioning  covers  initial  operation  to  identify  and  rectify  any  construction  faults  prior  to \nofficial contractors handover of completed systems to IMCs. Commissioning will be progressive \nover the final three years of project implementation. Partial operations will commence in the final \n2 years but the irrigation systems will not be fully operational until project completion. Particular \nattention  will  be  given  to  establishment  of  a  Phuoc  Hoa  subunit  of  the  Dau  Tieng  IMC.  The \nconsultants  will  identify  specific  facilities  needed,  expertise,  and  staffing  requirements,  and \nprepare detailed operating and management procedures, including those relating to minimizing \nthe social and environmental impacts of the barrage (according to World Commission on Dams  \nguidelines) which will be supported by a full operation manual. The operating and management \nprocedures should be developed in consultation with stakeholders, including  the Dong Nai river \nbasin organization. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\nSummary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nA. \n\nLinkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nYes \n\nSector identified as a national priority \nin Country Poverty Analysis?             \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  Poverty in Viet Nam is concentrated in the rural \nareas, where around 85% of the poor live. Nearly 80% of poor household are engaged in agriculture as their primary \noccupation.  The  water  resources  sector  is  therefore  important  for  development  of  irrigated  agriculture  to  improve \nfood  security,  income  generation,  and  job  creation,  and  general  quality  of  life  in  rural  areas.  The  water  resources \nsector  provides  important  support  to  the  agriculture  sector,  which  accounts  for  25%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP), 60% of the labor force, and 30% of the country's exports. \n\nSector identified as National Priority in  \nCountry Poverty Partnership Agreement?      Yes \n \n\nPoverty Analysis Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\nA social analysis was carried out during the feasibility study in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Incorporation of \nSocial Dimensions in Bank Operations. It included an assessment of the incidence of poverty which revealed that the \nmain nature and perceptions of its causes are: (i) lack of access to functioning irrigation and drainage; (ii) low level of \neducation; (iii) landlessness; (iv) poor access to market centers and social services; (v) lack of access to low interest \ncredit; (vi) surplus labor within the households and chronic unemployment or underemployment especially among the \nyoung; (vii) gender-related factors; and (viii) poor health, especially due to waterborne diseases and malaria. \n \nThe social analysis identified specific groups within the population who are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged \nand  unable  to  benefit  directly  from  project  interventions  without  some  social  preparation.  There  are  significant \nnumbers of poor landless households, many of them headed by women, and a high percentage of children living in \npoor households, many of whom are affected by Agent Orange-related health problems.  It also identified pockets of \nlarge numbers of pensioners and disability support recipients, as well as some ethnic minorities. \n \nIncome data collected during the social survey showed that poverty is widespread in the project area (Tables A10.1 \nand  A10.2).  About  39%  of  households  in  the  three  irrigation  subproject  areas  have  incomes  below  the  national \npoverty  line  of  D149,000/person/month  ($0.33/person/day).  Using  the  international  poverty  line  of  $1/person/day, \n88%  are  below  the  poverty  line.  It  is  estimated  that  improved  agricultural  production  provided  by  the  Project  will \nincrease the average income by about D86,000/person/month, equating to about a 40% increase. It is estimated that \nthis  will  least  halve  the  incidence  of  poverty  (estimated  by  simple  linear  interpolation).  This  may  underestimate  the \nimpact,  given  that  it  represents  an  81%  increase  in  income  from  agriculture,  and  recent  the  Viet  Nam  Living \nStandards Survey shows that  more households own less agriculture land than the poor and generate much higher \nproportions of their income from off-farm activities. \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder analysis prepared \n\n \n\nYes \n\nParticipation Strategy \n\n \n\nYes \n\nA  participatory  and  consultative  methodology  was  adopted  to  undertake  the  social  analysis  during  the  feasibility \nstudy.  It  involved  (i) initial  field  reconnaissance  discussions  with  project  stakeholders;  (ii) group interviews in about \n15% of communes; (iii) detailed survey questionnaires of 605 households (about 2.2%); (iv) a series of stakeholders \nworkshops in the four concerned provinces of Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh, and Long An; (v) interviews with \nkey government staff, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other funding agencies; and (vi) group interviews \nwith ethnic minorities.  \n \nDuring project implementation there will be extensive participation of stakeholders. A team of community facilitators \nwill be deployed to implement a social support program. This will ensure close linkages are established between the \nimplementation team and the community. It will facilitate a participatory approach to detailed design of the irrigation \nworks  through  formation  of  water  user  groups  and  arranging  farmer  walk-throughs  to  finalize  alignments  in \naccordance with the groups\u2019 preferences. The institutional capacity of the groups will subsequently be developed to \nfacilitate  sustainable  management  of  the  system.  The  community  facilitators  will  also  be  responsible  for identifying \nand assisting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n\n \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nD. \n\nPotential Issues \n\nOutput \nPrepared \nFull RP \nand RF \n\nIssue \n\nAssessment \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nGender \n\nSignificant \n\nResettlement  Significant   A  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  for  the  main  component  and  a \nresettlement framework (RF) to be applied to the preparation of an RP for \neach subproject during project implementation.  \nThe RP for each subproject will be implemented and monitored. A social \nsupport program will facilitate community participation in selecting the final \ncanal  alignments  and  locating  structures  that  will  service  the  local \ncommunities  such  as  roads  and  canal  bridges,  aimed  at  minimizing \ndisruption  and  land  acquisition.  Steps  will  be  taken  to  ensure  adequate \nlivelihood  restoration  for  affected  people,  particularly disadvantaged and \nvulnerable households. \n \nThe  social  analysis  confirmed  that  the  burden  of  poverty  in  the  project \narea is disproportionately borne by women; about 25% of the households \nare  headed  by  women.  Compared  to  male-headed  households,  these \nwomen-headed  households  have  a  lower  level  of  education,  limited \naccess to land and credit, and much lower monthly incomes. Only 53% of \nfemale-headed households derive their main income from agriculture and \nforestry  activities  compared  to  80%  for  male-headed  households. \nSimilarly  41%  of  female-headed  households  derive  their  main  income \nfrom  wage  labor  as  opposed  to  only  17%  for  male-headed households. \nThese women are either widowed or abandoned. In addition, there are a \nnumber  of  single  elderly  women  living  alone  on  their  farms.  A  social \nsupport program will be implemented to address these issues. \n \nThe  social  analysis  identified  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups  who  will \nneed  assistance  to  ens ure  they  are  able  to  avail  of  the  project  benefits. \nThe social support program will assist these groups, including establishing \nthe  necessary  linkages  so  they  are  able  to  arrange  microcredit  under \nexisting programs. \n \nThe  Project  will  not  have  any  adverse  effect  on  labor;  it  is  expected  to \nhave  positive \nincreased \nagricultural production. \n \nThe social analysis identified that ethnic minorities make up approximately \n1.3%  of  households  in  the  project  area,  and  the  majority  of  these  are \nKhmer.  They  are  generally  well  integrated  in  the  communes  where  they \nlive. Group interviews with ethnic minority people highlighted the need in \nsome communes for documentation and training courses to be delivered \nin  Khmer  and  possibly  other  minority  languages  to  facilitate  their  full \nparticipation in the Project. The greatest concentration of ethnic minorities \nis in the inundation area of proposed Phuoc Hoa barrage, and especially \nin Nha Bich Commune where Khmer account for up to 23% of the entire \npopulation.

In addition, a large number of households will benefit from improved supplies \nof  water  for  domestic  and  industrial  use  and  from  improved  salinity  control  in  downstream \nreaches  of  rivers.  The  main  quantified  benefits  of  the  Project  are  incremental  outputs  of \nagricultural  products  (primarily  rice,  maize,  groundnuts,  vegetables,  sugarcane,  and  fruit)  from \n48,130 hectares (ha) in three new irrigation areas. After allowing for increased consumption by \nproducer  households  the  residual  incremental  output  will  largely  be  marketed  domestically. \nThere  will  also  be  incremental  production  of  fish  from  paddy  fields  and  ponds.  In  addition  to \noutputs from land-based activities, water will be supplied to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and other \nmunicipalities for domestic, municipal, and industrial use. \n \n2. \nAs a result of the Project\u2019s new infrastructure, about 2,807 ha of existing agricultural land \nwill  be  lost.  It  is  estimated  that  land  losses  will  represent  about  7%  of  the  potential  command \narea.  About  454  households,  who  will  lose  their  houses  and  farm  structures,  will  need  to  be \nrelocated, retrained, and assisted with the establishment of new businesses.  \n \n\n2. \n\nNonquantified \n\nProvision of an alternative water source for HCMC will improve the security of supply for \n3. \nthe city by lessening the risk from an event such as gross contamination of the Dong Nai river \nfrom which the bulk of existing needs are drawn. Dependence on groundwater supplies will also \nbe reduced. In addition, the scheme will have sufficient capacity to allow the intermittent release \nof  water  for  salinity  control  in  the  Saigon  river  while  by-flow  from  the  new  irrigated  areas  will \ncontribute to a reduction in salinity in both the Saigon and Vam Co Dong rivers. It has not been \npossible  to  value  any  of  these  benefits.  On  the  other  hand,  possible  economic  and \nenvironmental  disbenefits  as  a  result  of  reduced  flows  downstream  of  the  Phuoc  Hoa  barrage \nafter  diversions  begin  to  operate  were  also  considered.  In  the  lower  Be  river,  the  required \nminimum environmental flow is set so as to avoid any potential impacts becoming significant. In \nthe low Dong Nai river downstream of its confluence with the Be river, the Phuoc Hoa diversions \nrepresent only a small portion of the average dry season flows (about 6%), so impacts will be \nminimal.  Hence  it  was  concluded  that  negative  impacts  will  be  small,  and  therefore  they  have \nnot been quantified in the feasibility study.  \n \n4. \nDuring  project  implementation,  access  roads  will  be  constructed  along  major  canals. \nAlthough  the  standard  of  the  existing  road  network  in  the  proposed  irrigation  areas  is,  in \ngeneral,  quite  good,  roads  to  be  constructed  under  the  Project  will,  in  some  areas,  provide \nimproved  access  for  local  people  and  will  facilitate  the  movement  of  goods  and  services. \nSupplies  of  crop  by-products,  which  can  be  used  as  animal  feed,  will  improve  throughout  the \nirrigated  areas  as  cropping  intensity  increases.  A  small,  but  unquantified,  increase  in  animal \nproduction is likely to result. Finally, social support activities to be initiated under the Project are \nexpected  to  improve  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  landless  and  female-headed \nhouseholds. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nHouseholds \n\nChanges in household income have been estimated for six representative farm models \n5. \n(Table A11.1) covering the main cropping patterns that are expected to develop in response to \nchanges in the availability of irrigation water. Over half of the Duc Hoa area is currently irrigated \nfrom  small  diversion  or  pumped  schemes,  with  water  shortages  a  common feature. Scheme \nwater  will  replace  local  supplies  in  this  area.  Changes  in  cropping  patterns  will  include  an \nincrease  in  dry-season  cropping  of  groundnuts,  maize,  and  vegetables  as  well  as  expanded \nplantings  of  fruit  trees,  especially  longan.  With  the exception of local varieties of rice grown in \nthe monsoon season, the highest returns for annual crops are obtained in the dry season when \nthe  climatic  conditions  are  most  suitable,  provided  that  irrigation  water  is  available.  Fruit \nproduction is by far the most profitable enterprise. Between 1,000 and 1,500 households will be \nable to supplement their agricultural earnings from pond paddy field fish production. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Summary of Farm Model Analysis\u2014All Areas \n\n \n \nArea/ \nFarm  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \nFarm \nSize  Present  F W/O  F W    Present  F W/O \n\nCropping Intensity \n(%) \n\n Farm Surplus After \nFinancing ($) \n\nF W \n\n Return to Family  \nLabor Day  ($/day) \n\n   Present   F W/O \n\nF W \n\nIncremental \nReturn \nPer Day \nIncl.

For  1  ha  farms,  incomes  rise  to  between  $350  and  $400  per \nannum  compared  to  about  half  that  amount  at  present.  For  farms  in  the  2  ha  to  3  ha  range, \nincomes rise by between $1,400 to $3,500 per annum, from less than $1,000 at present. While \nthe  income  from  a  0.2  ha  farm  is  expected  to  double,  it  will  still  only  be  a  little  over  $100  per \nannum,  well  below  the  poverty  line.  Assurances  have  been  obtained  from  Viet  Nam  Bank  for \nAgriculture and Rural Development that credit to finance onfarm investments such as orchards \nwill be available, subject to the Bank\u2019s usual lending criteria. \n\nFor  all  representative  farms,  both  returns  to  family  labor  and  financial  internal  rates  of \n7. \nreturn  after  meeting  irrigation  service  charges  are  attractive  and  should  provide  a  strong \nincentive  for  participation  in  the  Project.  Furthermore,  agricultural  systems  in  the  project  area \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nare  dynamic  with  farmers  prepared  to  change  to  quite  different  cropping  patterns  and  crop \nmixes in response to market signals and the expectation of better returns.  Much of the area has \nbeen settled relatively recently with farmers appearing to be very responsive to change. Family \nlabor is adequate to meet most of the labor demands of more intensive production systems on \nfarms of about 1 hectare or less, and survey data show there is unused family labor. On larger \nfarms, hired labor will be required, especially at peak demand times. Potential for labor conflicts \nis not considered to be significant. It will be highest for the annual cropping systems, although \nthe proposed cropping intensities (250%) are unlikely to cause overlap between harvest of one \ncrop  and  planting  of  another.  Careful  farm-level  planning  through  agricultural  extension  can \nminimize  risks.  Existing  contract-harvesting  systems  for  fruit  and  sugarcane  are  expected  to \ncontinue.  In  the  longer  term,  mechanization  is  expected  to  increase  as  labor  is  attracted  from \nrural areas to the light industrial and service sectors in HCMC and its environs. \n\n2. \n\nWater Management Institutions \n\n8. \nWater management institutions will incur costs to maintain the scheme and to manage \nthe distribution of water. In addition, pumping costs will be incurred in two areas where gravity \ndistribution is not feasible. In nonpumped areas, irrigation service fees of about $54 per hectare \nwill need to be levied to cover costs, while in pumped areas, fees of about $87 per ha will be \nrequired.  Operating  costs  may  to  some  extent  be  offset  through  sales  of  water  for  domestic, \nmunicipal, and industrial (DMI) use, which would allow a reduction in service fees. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nGeneral \n\n9. \nThe  economic  analysis  draws  together  the  investment  costs  of  the  Project  during  a  7-\nyear implementation period, plus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits, and \ncompares  them  with  the  quantified  incremental  benefits,  over  a  35-year  period.  Incremental \nbenefits  have  been  estimated  by  comparing  with  project  outputs  with  the  expected  future \nposition  without  project.  In  this  latter  case,  some  increase  in  output  from  existing  farming \nsystems  is  assumed  reflecting  improvements  in  dryland  production  systems  that  would  have \noccurred in the absence of the Project. Rice, maize, groundnuts, sugar, diesel, and all fertilizers \nare assumed to be tradables and have been valued at their border equivalents. All other inputs \nand  outputs,  with  the  exception  of  DMI  water  for  HCMC,  and  electricity,  have  been  valued  at \ncompetitive market prices, after adjusting for taxes, duties, and an implicit overvaluation of the \nexchange rate. Avoided pumping and distribution costs have been used as the basis for valuing \nDMI water. Electricity used in pumping has been valued at its long-run marginal cost of supply. \nAll  investments  are  assumed  to  have  a  zero  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  analysis  period. \nThe economic cost of lost land was taken into account in the analysis by excluding production in \nthe with project situation. Cost of acquiring the land is not taken as an economic cost.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPrice Numeraire and Conversion Factors \n\nA world price numeraire has been used. Base costs and benefits are in mid-2002 terms. \n10. \nA conversion factor of 0.9 has been used to express most civil works prices in efficiency terms. \nIn  the  case  of  unskilled  labor,  a  shadow  wage  rate  factor  of  0.8  has  been  used  to  express \nwages  in  terms  of  opportunity  costs.  For  civil  works  with  a  significant  component  of  unskilled \nlabor,  a  conversion  factor  of  0.85  has  been  used.  For  diesel,  no  price  adjustment  has  been \nmade,  as  the  current  domestic  price  is  very  close  to  the  equivalent  untaxed  world  price. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nDomestic  prices  of  nontraded  goods  and  services  have  been  converted  to  their  economic \nequivalent by multiplying their financial prices by a standard conversion factor of 0.91. \n\n3. \n\nIncremental Outputs \n\n11. \nAgriculture.  Significant  changes  in  land  use  and  cropping  intensities  are  expected to \noccur, as scheme water becomes available. These changes and all the related investments are \nassumed to be substantially complete by the end of the Project in the seventh year. All current \nareas of cashew and cassava will be replaced, partly with vegetables (a 231% increase in area) \nand with fruit (a 20% increase in area). Other land use changes will include a 9% decline in the \narea  of  sugar  cane  and  an  increase  in  the  dry  season  cropping  of  rice,  with  the  area  of  rice \nremaining about the same. The area of maize will increase from about 240 ha at present to over \n13,000 ha with project, largely replacing rice on currently rain-fed upland areas, while the area \nof  groundnuts  will  increase  from  about  4,890  ha  to  about  17,920 ha,  an  84%  increase  over \nfuture without project areas. Over the whole net command area (see Table A11.1 for individual \nfarms), annual cropping intensities are expected to rise to about 245% from the present 142%. \n\n12. \nIncremental benefits are assumed to commence in year 5 and progressively increase to \nthe  assumed  maximum  yields  in  year  17.  Increments  (future  without  project  compared  with \nfuture with project) include rice (28,668 t), groundnuts (16,107 t), maize (56,032 t), vegetables \n(14,459 t), sugarcane (59,716 t), and fruit (28,221 t). \n\n13. \nAquaculture. It is envisaged that a combination of gravity irrigation and suitable soils for \naquaculture  will  be  found  in  up  to  3%  of  the  command  area,  producing  a  return  (in  economic \nprices)  of  between  $1,000  to  $2,000  per  ha  per  year.  It  is  assumed  that  the  benefits  will \ncommence  in  year  5  and  stabilize  in  year  11.  An  amount  of  $979,814  per  annum  at  full \ndevelopment has been included in the economic analysis for fisheries benefits. \n\nDMI  Water.  At  full  development,  the  scheme  will  have  the  capacity  to  supply  up  to \n14. \n10 m3/s to the greater HCMC area for DMI use. On the assumption that water would need to be \nlifted from the Dong Nai river then distributed by pipeline to the western areas of HCMC in the \nabsence of the Project, this water is valued in economic prices (net of incremental Phuoc Hoa \nscheme costs) at D478/m 3 ($0.03/m3) for a total annual value of supply of $10.33 m. \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity \n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, in the base  case, is 14.2%. \n15. \nSensitivity tests show that the EIRR is most sensitive to changes in investment costs, the timing \nof benefits, and a combination of price changes in tradable outputs and fruit. If irrigation system \ninvestment  costs  rise  by  10%,  the  EIRR  falls  to  13.5%.  A  delay  in  the  start  of  the  benefits \nstream by a year reduces the EIRR to 12.7%. If agricultural output prices fall by 10%, the EIRR \nfalls  to  13.1%.  Base-case  resource  flows  are  summarized  in  Table  A11.2.  Switching  values \nhave been estimated for fruit and vegetables, which are expected to contribute about 35% of the \nincremental value of project output. The analysis shows that the price of fruit would need to fall \nto  about  half  of  the  base  case  price  assumption,  and  vegetable  prices  can  fall  to  zero, before \nthe  EIRR  falls  to  around  12%.  Agricultural  output  prices  would  together  need  to  fall  by  nearly \n20%  before  the  EIRR  fell  below  12%.  Overall,  the  economic  viability  is  quite  robust,  mainly \nbecause the benefits are derived from a wide mix of crops as well as from supplying domestic \nand urban water. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nOutflows \n\n  Dam & Transfer Canal \n  Other \n     Subtotal \n\n Irrigation Infrastructure \n \n \n \n Operation & Management \n Project Support \n \n\n  Total Outflows \n\nInflows \n\n  Binh Long \n  Tan Binh \n  Duc Hoa \n     Subtotal \n\n Net Agricultural Benefits \n \n \n \n \n Saved Pumping Costs \n Aquaculture Benefits \n DMI Water Value \n  Total Inflows \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNet Resource Flows \n\n(4.40) \n\n Economic Internal Rate of Return \n  Net Present Value ($ million) @   12% \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDMI = domestic, municipal, and industrial. \n\nTable A11.2: Project Resource Flows ($ million in mid-2002 prices) \n \n\nYear of Project \n\n      1 \n\n       2 \n\n     3 \n\n     4 \n\n     5 \n\n     6 \n\n     7 \n\n     8 \n\n   15 \n\n   35 \n\n0.02 \n \u2014\n0.02 \n0.00 \n4.37 \n4.40 \n\n \n \n0.00 \n\u2014  \n0.00 \n 0.07 \n7.69 \n7.76 \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n\n \n \n20.62 \n18.82 \n39.44 \n1.37 \n6.74 \n47.56 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0.04 \n   \n   \n0.04 \n\n \n \n \n \n4.35 \n25.72 \n20.05 \n\u2014 \n24.40 \n25.72 \n2.18 \n0.52 \n2.86 \n8.39 \n29.44 \n34.63 \n \n \n \n \n0.17 \n \n0.63 \n \n0.90 \n \n1.69 \n   \n0.06 \n   \n0.14 \n   \n1.72 \n  \n3.61 \n   \n(7.76)  (34.63)  (47.52)  (25.83) \n \n14.2% \n \n21.33 \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n0.26 \n9.16 \n9.41 \n2.70 \n0.88 \n12.99 \n \n \n0.36 \n1.35 \n1.92 \n3.63 \n0.08 \n0.28 \n3.44 \n7.43 \n(5.56) \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n0.61 \n0.61 \n2.78 \n0.37 \n3.77 \n\n \n \n   \n \n   \n2.78 \n0.25 \n3.03 \n \n \n1.31 \n0.93 \n4.13 \n3.17 \n5.44 \n4.37\n10.88 \n8.46\n0.17 \n0.11 \n0.56 \n0.42 \n6.89 \n6.89 \n15.88\n18.50 \n12.12  15.46 \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n2.78 \n0.13 \n2.91 \n \n \n3.66 \n9.23 \n\n \n \n   \n   \n   \n2.78 \n0.13 \n2.91 \n \n \n3.78 \n9.24 \n11.05  11.17 \n23.94  24.19 \n0.17 \n0.98 \n10.33  10.33 \n35.42  36.35 \n32.51  35.66 \n \n \n \n \n\n0.17 \n0.98 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\nRecurrent Budget Implications of the Project \n\nUnder  the  Project,  it  is  proposed  that  the  full  cost  of  operating  the  scheme  (including \n16. \nmaintenance of O&M roads constructed under the Project) will be recovered from beneficiaries \nthrough  irrigation  service  fees  and  pumping  charges.  If  collection  is  poorly  administered, \nhowever,  or  if  beneficiaries  become  reluctant  to  pay  because  of  poor  service  delivery,  then \nwater management groups will run at a deficit. It is exactly this situation that currently exists in \nthe Dau Tieng irrigation system. In 2000, for example, budgeted collection of irrigation service \nfees was about $0.29 million, only about a third of the fee that could have been justified had the \nscheme  been  adequately  maintained.  If  such  a  situation  were  allowed  to  continue  with  the \nPhuoc Hoa Project, annual operating deficits could be as high as D30.0 million ($1.97 million), \nassuming incremental operating costs of D45.45 million ($2.99 million). \n\n17. \nContinuing  environmental  monitoring  will  be  required  beyond  the  6.5-year  life  of  the \nProject.  The  incremental  recurrent  cost  is  estimated  at  about  D2.13  million  ($0.14  million)  per \nannum.  In  addition,  it  is  expected  that  social  services  support  will  be  required  for  displaced \npersons for 3 years beyond the life of the Project at a cost of about D1.98 million ($0.13 million) \nper annum. All other incremental support services are expected to terminate at the close of the \nProject. \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\f \n\nE. \n\nRisks \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n59 \n\n1. \n\nAdoption of Irrigated Agricultural Production Systems \n\nThe economic analysis assumes that the whole of the net command area is converted to \n18. \nirrigated  production  by  the  close  of  the  Project  or  shortly  beyond.  Any  delay  in  the  rate  of \nadoption or the ultimate level of adoption achieved would have a significant impact on the EIRR. \nTwo  factors  are  expected  to  minimize  these  risks.  First,  about  half  of  the  command  area  is \nalready being irrigated using a variety of systems\u2014flood diversion, pumping from groundwater, \ngroup schemes pumping from streams, and local storage-based systems. Farmers with access \nto these water sources are already engaged in irrigated production, although in most cases not \nto the extent envisaged with project. They are expected to substitute project-supplied water for \nlocal  supplies  and  to  intensify  production  at  a  rapid  rate  thereafter.  They  also  have  the \nadvantage  that  tertiary  distribution  structures  are  already  in  place  in  much  of  the  currently \nirrigated area. \n\nSecond,  community  development  support  is  to  be  provided  under  the  Project  to  help \n19. \nbeneficiaries  become  involved  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  tertiary-level  irrigation \ndevelopment  from  an  early  stage.  This  support  will  increase  awareness  about  the  potential \nbenefits of the Project and a sense of scheme ownership by beneficiaries is expected to result. \nAfter  the  design  stage,  the  emphasis  will  shift  to  the  establishment of water user groups with \ntraining  being  provided  in  the  management  of  such  groups.  Extension  services  will  also  be \nprovided under the Project to assist beneficiaries with decisions about irrigated agriculture. With \nthis level of support, a high level of participation should be assured. \n\n2. \n\nFruit and Vegetable Production \n\n20. \nFruit  and  vegetables  are  projected  to  contribute  about  35%  of  the  incremental \nagricultural  value  of  the  Project.  Vegetable  production  is  expected  to  increase  by  over  200% \ncompared  with  the  future  without  project  situation  with  fruit  production  growing  by  over  35%. \nWhile  these  are  large  increases,  they  will  not  be  reached  in  full  until  about  12  years  from  the \ntime  farm  development  commences  in  the  fourth  year  of  the  Project.  During  this time, market \ntrends  can  be  reviewed,  and  development  activities  amended  if  necessary.  Furthermore,  the \nincremental  fruit  and  vegetable  areas  are  only  about  1%  and  1.5%  respectively  of  the  total \nexisting areas of those crops in the country and the incremental output would not normally be \nexpected  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  prices.  However,  there  is  a  risk  that  prices  will  fall \nunless  urban  incomes  continue  to  rise  and  local  and  export  marketing  opportunities  are \ndeveloped. This risk will be reduced somewhat through marketing studies to be carried out by \nconsultants  to  be  engaged  as  part  of  project  support  activities.  In  addition,  the  Government  is \nsupporting  the  establishment  of  agroprocessing  facilities  and  is  committed  to  furthering  the \ndevelopment of export markets for fruit and vegetables.    \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2003) \n", "Currency Unit \nD1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "dong (D) \n$0.00006425 \nD15,564 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \nFor  the  purpose  of  calculations  in  this  report,  the  rate  of  $1.00  =  D15,200  was  used,  the  rate \ngenerally prevailing at the time of loan appraisal. \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ADB \nAFD \nBLIS \nCPO \nDARD \n", "DHIS \nDMI \nDOSTE \n", "DTIS \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nHCMC  \nIA \nICB \nIMC \nLCB \nMARD \nMONRE \nO&M \nOSDP \nPMB416  \nPMU \nPPMB  \nRP \nSEIA \nTBIS \nVCD \nVWRAP  \nWRL \nWUG \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \nBinh Long irrigation system \nCentral Project Office \ndepartment of agriculture and rural development \n(provincial level) \nDuc Hoa irrigation system \ndomestic, municipal, and industrial \ndepartment of science, technology, and environment \n(provincial level) \nDau Tieng irrigation system \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nHo Chi Minh City \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \nirrigation management company \nlocal competitive bidding \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment \noperation and maintenance \nonfarm and social development program \nProject Management Board 416 \nproject management unit \nprovincial project management board \nresettlement plan \nsummary environmental impact assessment \nTan Bien irrigation system \nVam Co Dong (river) \nViet Nam Water Resources Assistance Project \nWater Resource Law \nwater users group \n", "NOTES \n \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
