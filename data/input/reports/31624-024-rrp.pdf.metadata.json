The Melamchi tunnel, a key component of the MWSP, is \ncritical  for  supplying  bulk  water  to  the  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  its  performance  affects  the \nprogress of several other downstream water supply and wastewater projects in the valley. The \nadditional financing, which is needed to meet cost overruns resulting from the higher amount of \nthe new contract for the Melamchi tunnel, is important to achieve the expected outcomes of the \nMWSP. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  MWSP  on  21 \nDecember  2000,  and  the  project  became  effective  on  28  November  2001. 2  It  is  a \ncomprehensive  water  supply  project  to  improve  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  the  people  in  the \nKathmandu  Valley.  It  aims  to  alleviate  the  shortage  of  potable  water  in  the  valley  by  diverting \nwater from the Melamchi River to the Kathmandu Valley.  \n\n \n\n4. \nSince  2004,  major  events  and  changing  circumstances  in  Nepal  have  hampered  the \nimplementation of the MWSP. The government\u2019s efforts to secure private sector participation to \nmanage water services in the Kathmandu Valley were  unsuccessful. During the initial years of \nthe  MWSP,  private  sector  bidders  were  not  interested  in  a  lease  contract,  supported  by  the \nWorld  Bank, for  water services delivery. When  this  led  to  significant  delays  in  project  start-up, \nthe  World  Bank  canceled  its  funding.  A  subsequent  ADB-supported  performance-based \nmanagement  contract  also  failed  to  attract  private  sector  interest  despite  several  years  of \nfocused  efforts.  The  government  and  ADB  realized  that  private  sector  engagement  in  Nepal\u2019s \nurban water sector was too difficult in the unpredictable sociopolitical environment of that time. \nConsequently,  the  biggest  civil  works  package  under  the  MWSP\u2014the  27.5  kilometer  (km) \nMelamchi  tunnel\u2014was  put  on  hold  because  the  loan  covenants  included  a  condition  that  the \nperformance-based  management  contract  had  to  be  awarded  before  the  contract  for  the \nMelamchi tunnel. Furthermore, three development partners withdrew from the MWSP because \nof political developments in that period,3 leaving a funding gap of $133 million equivalent. \n \n5. \nThe  MWSP  experienced  additional  challenges.  ADB\u2019s  Office  of  the  Special  Project \nFacilitator,  and  later  the  Compliance  Review  Panel,  initiated  investigations  in  May  2004  into  a \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nKingdom  of  Nepal  for  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project.  Manila.  The  total  project  cost  was  estimated  at  $464 \nmillion  equivalent  in  2000  prices,  which  was  to  be  funded  by  the  Government  of  Nepal  ($118  million)  and  a \nconsortium  of  development  partners:  ADB  ($120  million),  the  World  Bank  ($80  million),  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  ($52  million),  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  ($18 million),  the  Norwegian \nAgency  for  Development  Cooperation  ($28  million),  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency \n($25  million),  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  ($9  million),  and  the  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries \nFund for International Development ($14 million). \n\n3  World  Bank  in  2002,  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  in  2005,  and  Swedish  International \n\nDevelopment Cooperation Agency in 2006.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nthese \n\ninvestigations  uncovered  any \n\ncomplaint regarding resettlement issues from a nongovernment organization. In June 2005, the \nintegrity division of the Office of the Auditor General initiated an investigation into allegations of \ncorruption  in  the  procurement  process  of  a  contract  for  the  access  road.4 Although  neither  of \nthese \ntwo  cases  delayed  project \nirregularities, \nimplementation  and  affected  the  decision-making  process  of  the  government  and  the \nimplementing agency. \n \n6. \nIn 2008, ADB approved a major change in the scope and implementation arrangements \nof  the  loan  and  associated  projects  to  restructure  the  project  design,  optimize  the  available \nfunding,  and  suit  the  changed  institutional  environment.5 The  most  important  change  was  the \nremoval  of  the  loan  covenant  requiring  a  performance-based  management  contract  as  a \ncondition  for  awarding  the  contract  for  the  Melamchi  tunnel.  The  restructuring  of  the  projects \nallowed  construction  of  the  tunnel,  which  had  been  on  hold  from  2000  to  2008,  to  begin.  The \nchange  in  scope  did  not  alter  the  MWSP\u2019s  development  benefits  or  impact.  Moreover,  the \nMWSP was divided into two subprojects with different implementing agencies, which enhanced \nimplementation  efficiency  by  distributing  responsibilities.  The  Melamchi  Water  Supply \nDevelopment  Board  (MWSDB)  continued  to  implement  the  Melamchi  River  water  diversion \nsubproject  (subproject  1),  which  includes  the  Melamchi  tunnel.  The  newly  established  water \nutility  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited  (KUKL)  became  the  implementing  agency  for \nthe  Kathmandu  Valley  water  supply  and  sanitation  subproject  (subproject  2),  which  includes \ndistribution network improvements in the valley.  \n \n7. \nFollowing  the  restructuring  of  the  MWSP,  the  MWSDB  awarded  the  contract  for  the \nMelamchi  tunnel  to  China  Railway  15  Bureau  Group  Corporation  on  19  February  2009  for \nNRs4,288  million.  The  tunnel  was  scheduled  for  completion  by  2  September  2013.  Physical \nworks  started  in  April  2010  because  of  the  time  required  for  preparations,  including  handing \nover  the  sites  to  the  contractor  and  addressing  social  problems  encountered  in  contract \nimplementation.  The  MWSDB  terminated  the  contract  on  25  September  2012  because  of  the \nunsatisfactory  performance  of  the  contractor.  As  of  the  termination  date,  only  23%  of  tunnel \nexcavation\u20146.3 km of 27.5 km\u2014had been completed.   \n \n8. \nThe  MWSDB  rebid  the  tunnel  contract,  which  was  awarded  to  Cooperativa  Muratori  e \nCementisti  di  Ravenna  of  Italy  on  15  July  2013  for  NRs8,727  million.  The  new  contract  is \nscheduled for completion on 30 September 2016. Additional financing of $25 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  which  is  proposed  to  meet  this  cost  overrun,  will  support  the \ncompletion of the Melamchi tunnel and the achievement of the original project\u2019s outcomes. The \nproposed additional financing will not change the scope of the restructured project. \n \n9. \nWhile the  MWSP  is  not performing  well,  both the original  and the restructured projects \nremain  the  most  critical  components  of  the  water  supply  system  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  As \nthe  Melamchi  tunnel  is  essential  to  achieving  the  full  benefits  of  an  improved  water  supply \n                                                \n4   The  Royal  Commission  for  Corruption  Control,  formed  after  the  royal  takeover  of  1  February  2005,  led  the \ninvestigation. As a result of the commission\u2019s investigation, several high-level government officials\u2014both politicians \nand bureaucrats, including the executive director of the MWSP implementing agency\u2014were imprisoned. This was \nfollowed  by  substantial  changes  in  the  implementing  agency\u2019s  top  management.  After  the  abolishment  of  the \ncommission following the end of the royal regime, all charges were dropped. \n\n5   ADB.  2000.

Manila;  ADB.  2008.  Major  Change  in  Scope  and  Implementation  Arrangements: \nKathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program Manila. \n\n \n\n\fsystem in the Kathmandu Valley, a reduction in scope or cancellation of the project would not be \nappropriate. A reduction or cancellation of the project at this stage (i) would result in a waste of \nproject  expenditures,  (ii)  would  be  detrimental  to  the  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  sector \npriorities,  and  (iii)  could  cause  potential  reputational  risk  for  ADB.  The  project  continues  to  be \ntechnically  feasible  and  economically  sound,  and  the  net  benefits  of  providing  additional \nfinancing to complete the project far outweigh any other option. \n \n10. \nDespite  the  difficulties,  the  government  has  consistently  maintained  its  commitment  to \nthe  MWSP.  In  addition  to  continuing  infrastructure  development  under  the  MWSP,  the \ngovernment  has  slowly  initiated  institutional  reforms.  The  most  important  reforms  include \nseparation of asset ownership from management; establishment of an independent commission \nfor regulating water tariffs; and establishment of an autonomous water operator company under \nthe Companies Act (1996). Three key entities have been established: (i) the Kathmandu Valley \nWater  Supply  Management  Board,  asset  owner  of  water  and  wastewater  systems  within  the \nvalley; (ii) the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission,  which is responsible for the economic \nregulation  of  the  sector;  and  (iii)  the  KUKL,  which  is  in  charge  of  operating  the  assets  under \nlease and license from Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board. Laws have been \namended or  enacted to allow  the  implementation  of these institutional reforms  and  the  private \nsector participation scheme.6 This level of institutional reform in the urban water sector has few \nparallels  in  South  Asia.  Moreover,  the  government  and  ADB  are  implementing  downstream \nimprovement  in  the  water supply  distribution  network  and  wastewater  management  projects  in \nthe Kathmandu Valley to improve the delivery of water supply and wastewater services.7 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe aggregate impact and outcome of the project as a result of the additional financing \nremain  the  same  as  those  of  the  current  project.  The  impact  will  be  the  improved  health  and \nwell-being  of  the  people  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  outcome  will  be  the  alleviation  of  the \nshortage  of  potable water  in the  valley.  The  performance  targets  and  indicators for the  impact \nhave  been  revised  to  reflect  the  sector-specific  impact  and  are  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1).  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe additional financing will be provided for the Melamchi Valley Subproject (subproject \n1). The aggregate outputs of the MWSP\u2019s two subprojects as a result of the additional financing \nwill  broadly  remain  the  same  as  those  of  the  current  project.  The  minor  corrections,  mainly \neditorial, are in the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n13. \n \n\nThe subproject 1 outputs will be as follows: \n\n(i) \n\nOutput  1:  Raw  water  diverted  from  Melamchi  Valley  to  Kathmandu  Valley. \nThis output will include (a)  a 27.5 km Melamchi  diversion tunnel completed and \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of bulk water provided to Kathmandu Valley, (b) \n\n                                                \n6  The Water Supply Management Board Act (Act No. 21, 2063 [2006]).

The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  it  is  fully  committed  to \ncompleting  this  project,  and  would  provide  extra  financial  resources  from  its  own  funds,  if \nrequired,  without  requesting  any  further  financial  support  from  ADB  for  this  project.  The \ngovernment will also provide for the contingent liability for the bonus for early completion, which \nis  in  the  new  contract  for  the  Melamchi  tunnel.  The  government  will  assume  the  foreign \nexchange risk.

The  only  change  in  the  implementation \narrangements  of  the  MWSP  is  the  closing  date,  which  has  been  extended from  31  December \n2013 to 31 December 2016 in line with that for the additional financing loan. The procurement of \nworks,  goods,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).

The government will assess the additional cost of the consultant up to \nthe revised closing date. The funds available under the original loan may be used to supplement \nthe government funds to meet the additional requirement of the consultant to ensure continuous \nconstruction  supervision  until  the  revised  closing  date.  The  government  has  also  requested  to \nincrease the percentage of ADB financing of the civil works under the original loan. The original \nloan categories have been amended to reflect the revised requirements. \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nRebidding  process  and  the  new  contract.  After  the  termination  of  the  previous \n20. \ncontract  for  the  Melamchi  tunnel  in  September  2012,  the  MWSDB  revised  the  detailed \nengineering  design  and  bidding  documents,  work  methodology,  equipment,  materials \nrequirements,  and  cost  estimates.  Advance  procurement  for  the  new  tunnel  contract  and  the \nongoing  tunnel  supervision  consultants  will  ensure  high  project  readiness.  The  MWSDB\u2019s \ncapacity  has  been  strengthened  through  the  deputation  of  additional  qualified  technical  staff \nfrom the Ministry of Urban Development. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  overall \nproject  including the  additional financing  is  18.92%;  the  net  present  value  is  $225.62 million.10 \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of return  is  higher than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of capital of \n12%, indicating a sufficient economic return. The results from a sensitivity analysis, which range \nfrom  17.47%  to  18.92%,  are  satisfactory  against  downside  risks,  including  a  10%  increase  in \ncapital  expenditure,  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs,  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits,  and  a  1-\nyear delay in project completion.  \n \n22. \nFinancial  analysis.  The estimated financial internal rate of return of the overall project \nincluding the additional financing is 7.93%; the net present value is $1.6 million.11 The financial \ninternal rate  of return  is slightly  higher  than the weighted  average  cost  of capital,  estimated  at \n7.90%,  indicating  an  adequate  financial  return.  The  sensitivity  analysis  reveals  that  financial \nviability of the project is most vulnerable to decreases in revenues, and efforts will be made by \nKUKL  to  rationalize  tariffs  and  enhance  revenues.  The  future  profitability  of  KUKL  will  be \nevaluated  once  the  water  utility  provides  accurate  financial  projections,  which  are  a \ndisbursement condition for the Kathmandu Valley Wastewater Management Project (footnote 7). \nTariff levels were increased in July 2013 by more than 80% and are expected to increase further \nwhen water becomes available from the Melamchi tunnel. The government also agreed in July \n2013 to shoulder KUKL\u2019s tax burden through a grant to the utility. With support from the ongoing \nloans  (footnotes  5  and  7),  KUKL  will  continually  work  to  make  operational  and  financial \nimprovements, including significant reductions in  nonrevenue water. These elements are likely \nto improve financial performance soon after the completion of the MWSP.  \n\n \n\n                                                \n10 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MWSDB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote  8).  Based  on  these \nassessments,  some  of  the  mitigation  measures  incorporated  in  the  project  design  aim  to  (i) \nestablish a mechanism for regular voluntary disclosure of project-related information to citizens; \n(ii)  regularly  update  the  project  website  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation, \nprocurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iii)  establish  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  ensure \nquick  and  effective  resolution.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MWSDB,  which \nhas been updated since 2008, does not indicate that any additional risks or mitigating measures \nwill  be  required. 12  Detailed  accounting  and  auditing  arrangements  are  given  in  the  project \nadministration manual. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nA poverty and social analysis has been completed, and the additional financing project is \n24. \nclassified  as  no  gender  elements.13 While  the  additional  financing  has  limited  impact  on  the \nsocial and gender aspects of the people in the Kathmandu Valley, the downstream water supply \nand wastewater projects (footnote 7) prioritize connecting all poor households and households \nheaded by women to the water supply and sewerage network in the Kathmandu Valley. Under \nthese projects, the government and KUKL have committed to reform current water supply and \nsewerage connection policies to facilitate individual connections to the poor, socially excluded, \nand households headed by women. Connection fees will be reduced for poor households under \nthese projects. A social uplift program (SUP) under the MWSP is being implemented to promote \nwidespread,  ongoing,  and  meaningful  participation  of  key  stakeholders. 14 These  projects  will \ncomplement  KUKL's  ongoing  efforts  to  strengthen  its  pro-poor  and gender-inclusive  sanitation \nservices.   \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n25. \nSocial safeguards. The additional financing is classified category C for both involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009).15 The  additional  financing  for  the  MWSP  will  not  change  the  safeguards  requirements \nfrom the original project as there will be no additional scope or civil  works to be implemented. \nThe PMU submits regular social safeguard monitoring reports to ADB, and these are reviewed \nand  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant \nsocial  safeguard  implementation  issues  have  arisen,  and  the  PMU  is  capable  of  effectively \nimplementing all safeguards. SUP activities will be continued for Melamchi Valley in line with the \noriginal  scope  and  will  cover  five  areas:  buffer  zone  development,  health,  education,  income \ngeneration, and community development. The inputs of the safeguard and social development \nsupport  consultant  will  be  continued  to  (i)  build  capacity  of  the  Melamchi  Valley  Development \nCommittee,  MWSDB,  and  relevant  stakeholders;  (ii)  support  the  development  committee  in \n\n                                                \n12 Draft Financial Management Assessment: Melamchi Water Supply Development Board (accessible from the list of \n\nsupplementary linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The  SUP  is  a  program  under  the  MWSP\u2019s  social  and  environmental  support  component  to  mitigate  direct  and \nindirect  project  impacts  and  improve  the  living  conditions  of  the  local  population  in  project-affected  village \ndevelopment committees.  \n\n15 The original project was classified category A for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. \n\n \n\n\fimplementing SUP activities and create community ownership; and (iii) ensure the subproject is \nimplemented in accordance with social and environmental safeguard requirements, and monitor \nsafeguard compliance. \n \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  C  for  the \n26. \nenvironment.16  An environmental management plan was prepared and disclosed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  PMU  submits  regular  environmental  safeguard \nmonitoring  reports  to  ADB,  and  these  are  reviewed  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. No significant environmental safeguard implementation issues has \narisen, and the PMU is capable of effectively implementing all safeguards. Appropriate clauses \nare  incorporated  in  the  tunnel  contract  to  control  the  adverse  impacts  of  construction.  This  is \nexpected  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts  such  as  (i)  damage  to  the  water  quality  of \nwaterways, (ii) increased erosion, (iii) deterioration of air quality at the construction site, (iv) loud \nsounds  from  blasting  or  machines,  and  (v)  failure  to  rehabilitate  land  temporarily  occupied  by \nthe  contractor.  The  tunnel  supervision  consultant  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  contractors \nfollow contract specifications, particularly for environmental mitigation. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n27.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nadditional financing are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCost  and \ntime  overruns  caused  by  poor \nmobilization of the contractor or procedural delays \n\ntake  action  according \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  engineer  will  closely  monitor  mobilization  and \nperformance  of  the  contractor  for  the  Melamchi \ntunnel  to  ensure  that  progress  stays  on  schedule, \nto  contractual \nand  will \nprovisions  for  any  delay.  Provisions  for  bonus  for \nearly  completion  and  penalties  for  the  delays,  as \nincorporated  in  the  bidding  documents,  will  be \nenforced.  The  MWSDB  will  prepare  timelines  for \ndecisions  for  handing  over  the  sites  and  approving \ndesigns,  drawings,  variations,  claims,  and  other \ncontractual  matters;  and  will  strictly  monitor \ncompliance with the timelines. The MOUD and ADB \nwill also regularly monitor the progress, quality, and \ncompliance  with  safeguards.  The  DSC  will  support \nproject  management,  safeguards,  reporting,  and \ntraining  on  FIDIC  contracts.  ADB  will  field  frequent \nmissions to oversee project performance. \nThe  MWSDB  and  the  engineer  will  ensure  that  the \ncontractor  takes  adequate  safety  measures.  Tunnel \nexcavation  will  be  permitted  only  after  ascertaining \nthe  geological  conditions  using  a  probe  drill,  geo-\nradar,  and  other  suitable \ntechniques.  Because \ntunnel  construction  is  inherently  hazardous,  the \ncontractor  will  be  required  to  enforce  the  highest \n\nLoss  of  life  and  property  because  of  uncertain \ngeological \nsite \nconditions \n\nconditions  and  hazardous \n\n                                                \n16 The original project was classified category A for environmental safeguards. \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nLocal communities oppose the construction of the \nMelamchi tunnel \n\nDelays \nconsultants \n\nin  payments \n\nto \n\ncontractors  and \n\nMitigating Measures \n\na \n\nfor \n\nconsensus \n\nstandards  of  safety \nfor  works,  workers,  and \nresidents at the work sites.
