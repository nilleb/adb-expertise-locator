It is estimated that 5.2 million tons \nof  solid  waste  is  generated  daily  worldwide,  of  which  3.8  million  tons  is  from  developing \ncountries.3  The failure to manage MSW appropriately causes serious local, regional, and global \nenvironmental problems such as air pollution, soil and groundwater contamination, and emissions \nof greenhouse gasses, methane (CH4) in particular. \n \nThe  goal  of  MSW  management  is  to  treat  MSW  in  an  environmentally  and  socially \n3. \nacceptable manner with appropriate clean technologies. The three main MSW treatment options \nare landfill, composting, and incineration. All waste disposal alternatives eventually decompose \norganic  materials  into  simpler  carbon  molecules  such  as  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  and/or  CH4.  In \ndeveloped countries with rich experience in waste management, incineration is recognized as the \nsingle  most  effective  method  for  MSW  treatment,4  as  it  reduces  waste  volume  by  90%  and \neliminates  CH4  emissions.  Furthermore,  WTE  technologies  recover  the  waste  heat  from \nincineration  process  and  steadily  produce  electricity  and  heat.  By  substituting  for  fossil  fuel \ncombustion  and  avoiding  CH4,  it  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  mitigates  climate \nchange.  Using  abundant  MSW  as  fuel  makes  WTE  plants  attractive  and  dependable  sources  of \nrenewable energy.   \n\n                                                 \n1  \u201cPrimary cities\" include Beijing, Dalian, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai, Shantou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xiamen, and \nZhuhai. \"Secondary cities\" are provincial capitols, if the province is not a \u201csuper province\u201d such as Guangdong, and \nother regionally important cities. \n\n2  Contributors are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n3  Cointreau, S. 2007.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nMunicipal Solid Waste Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n4. \nSuccessful  economic  reforms  and  significant  growth  in  the  PRC  economy  have \naccelerated  urbanization5  and  led  to  increases  in  MSW  generation  by  8\u201310%  annually.6  The \nPRC  is  now  the  world's  largest  MSW  generator,  producing  148  million  tons  annually.  Yet  the \nPRC's per capita MSW is still only 120 kilograms (kg) per annum, which is less than a quarter of \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  average  of  560  kg  per \nannum, leaving significant upward potential.7 \n \n5. \nThe effective disposal of MSW has been a serious environmental challenge in the PRC.   \nNearly 50%8  of MSW is untreated and dumped in un-engineered landfills that contaminate soil \nand groundwater. This is a particular problem in coastal regions, which have high groundwater \ntables  and  land  values.  Emission  control  and  leachate  treatment  in  engineered  landfills  often \nunderperform in the PRC for lack of adequate clean technologies and operational know-how.9   \n \n6. \nThis also poses a serious social challenge, as ever increasing numbers of migrants from \nrural areas often live near polluting landfills, making them vulnerable to the air pollution and soil \ncontamination.  The  urban  poor  are  exposed  to  infectious  diseases  from  MSW  and  respiratory \ndiseases from air pollution, threats to access to safe drinking water, and the risk of food poisoning \nfrom soil and groundwater contamination. Therefore, a more integrated approach to developing \nan efficient, environmentally sustainable, and well-managed MSW system is needed. \n \n\n3. \n\nWaste  to  Energy  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Private  Sector \nParticipation \n\n7. \nThe  promotion  of  WTE  technologies  has  been  seen  as  an  effective  way  to  mitigate \nenvironmental degradation, but it challenges the capacity of local governments to promote good \nWTE  infrastructure  with  sustainable  financing  and  the  timely  delivery  of  public  services.  Up  to \n2007, only 67 WTE plants have been built since the first in 1988. They process 11 million tons \nannually, or only 7.6% of the MSW generated. By 2020, the WTE market is projected to more than \nquadruple to 47 million tons, and the investment required to meet projected incineration demand \nis estimated at over CNY70 billion ($10 billion). \n \n8. \nMost  WTE  developers  in  the  PRC  have  used  locally  produced  circulating  fluidized bed \n(CFB) incinerators, which require supplemental fuels10  of up to 20-30% coal to burn MSW. The \nextensive  use  of  coal  without  adequate  emission  control  may  worsen  urban  air  pollution.  The \nsubstantial deployment of clean WTE technologies is urgently needed. \n \n9. \nThe Government alone cannot continue to be the main funding source for WTE expansion \nwith clean technologies. Private sector participation through public-private partnership (PPP) is \nexpected to play a critical role in improving the sector by (i) providing capital for new investment; \n(ii)  bringing  in  advanced  technology,  management,  and  operations;  (iii)  helping  municipal \n                                                 \n5  The PRC is undergoing massive urbanization, with over 41% of its population already living in urban areas, more than \n\ndouble the rate of less than 18% in 1978. \n\n6  Nie,  Y.  2008.  Development  and  Prospects  of  Municipal  Solid  Waste  (MSW)  Incineration  in  China.  Frontiers  of \n\nEnvironmental Science and Engineering in China Vol. 2, No.1. Beijing: Higher Education Press. \n\n7  Assuming a relatively conservative 3% annual MSW increase, MSW generation in the PRC is projected to be 224 \n\nmillion tons in 2020. \n\n8  Among the 661 municipalities throughout the country, 334 cities do not have any MSW treatment facilities. In terms of \nthe waste collected, only 52% was treated in 2006, while the remainder was disposed of in unimproved landfills. \n\n9  Altogether, 90.5% of MSW collected in the PRC was dumped into landfills in 2006. \n10  Supplemental fuels mean fuel to be added during operation (after start-up) to burn MSW. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\ngovernments  to  mitigate  environmental  impacts;  and  to  free  up  limited  public  funds  for  other \nimportant social spending. \n \n10. \nIn 2006, China Everbright International Limited (CEIL), the project sponsor, commenced \ncommercial  operation  of  the  first  project  in  the  PRC  to  adopt  advanced  clean  technologies, \nincluding grate incinerator technology, which is state-of-the-art, reliable technology in the United \nStates  and  Europe  and  does  not  require  coal  as  supplemental  fuel;  and  advanced  flue  gas \nemission  control  to  meet  the  world's  most  stringent  standards,  such as  the  European  Union  II \nstandard for dioxin.   \n \n\n4. \n\nPolicies and Regulations \n\nIn the 1980s, the Government of the PRC began studying and addressing the challenges \n11. \nof  prospective  energy  supply  shortages  and  environmental  degradation  stemming  from  the \nfast-growing  economy.  Following  rapid  economic  development,  the  Government  further \nemphasized environmental protection at the 17th Chinese Communist Party Congress and the \nChina  Central  Economic  Works  Conference  in  2007.  It  urged  the  country  to  pursue  scientific \ndevelopment and included in its aims building a society conscious of environmental issues and \nenergy conservation. In November 2007, 18 Government ministries jointly published the Action \nPlan for Environmental Protection and Good Health in China (2007\u20132015), which strengthened \npeople-orientated environmental protection policies. \n \n12. \nTo promote waste management and WTE, the Government enacted a series of laws and \nregulations. The Law on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution from Solid Waste \n(2004)  provides  the  basic  framework  for  treating  different  kinds  of  wastes,  and  the  Urban \nDomestic Waste Management Regulations (2007), the most recent and comprehensive laws in \nthe PRC, address urban environmental protection and waste management. Further, WTE was \nidentified  as  a  key  source  of  renewable  energy  in  the  Renewable  Energy  Law  (2005).  The \nGovernment  has  passed  new  regulations  under  which  grid  companies  are  obliged  to  take  all \nelectricity generated from qualified WTE plants in its grid area and offer a price premium.   \n \n13. \nUnder the 11th Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010), the Government sets the development of a \nrecycling  economy  as  a  national  goal.  Establishing  a  resource  recycling  system  for  the  whole \nsociety is emphasized in accordance with the principle of resource use reduction, reutilization, \nand  conservation.  Primary  cities  such  as  Beijing  started  segregating  MSW  for  recycling. \nMeanwhile, the Government set a long-term target for WTE, thermal recycling, to increase from \n1% of the total waste managed in 2002 to 30% by 2030. The Government has strengthened its \ncommitment  to  renewable  resources  generally  through  investment  and  favorable  taxation \npolicies,  and  specifically  in  relation  to  WTE,  having  made  a  high  priority  of  developing  the \nnecessary  technology.  Other  relevant  targets  in  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  include  (i)  investing \nCNY1,375 billion ($200 billion) in environmental protection;11  (ii) 35% of the MSW in the eastern \ncoastal  area  to  be  treated  through  WTE;  and  (iii)  the  daily  treatment  capacity  of  MSW  to  be \nincreased by 320,000 tons.   \n \n\n                                                 \n11  In  addition,  environmental  protection  was  identified  as  one  of  the  10  priority  investment  areas  in  the  stimulus \n\npackage. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC12  is based on four development thrusts: \n14. \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.     \n \n15. \nThe PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \ndriving  force  for  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  In  addition  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  advice  to  the \nGovernment  on  private  sector  development,  ADB  provides  project-based  financial  assistance. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on infrastructure, energy, finance, and \nenvironmental  improvement.  Regarding  infrastructure  and  energy,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering \nprojects  with  innovative  contractual  and  financial  structuring  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, enhance management expertise, and improve corporate governance.   \n \n\n2. \n\nStrategy 2020 \n\nADB's  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)13  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s \n16. \nsupport for achieving poverty reduction and inclusive growth through environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment  and  private  sector  development.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  infrastructure  and \nenvironment  being  two  of  the  five  core  areas  of  operations  in  the  strategy.  In  terms  of \ninfrastructure, specifically energy, the Project will embody the strategy, which sets forth that ADB \nwill (i) help expand the supply of energy; (ii) promote energy efficiency through supply-side and \ndemand-side  measures;  (iii)  support  clean  energy;  and  (iv)  facilitate  the  removal  of  policy, \ninstitutional,  regulatory,  technological,  and  legal  constraints  on  promoting  efficient  energy  use. \nWith  respect  to  the  environment,  the  Project  is  in  line  with  the  strategy's  focus  on  (i)  climate \nchange, (ii) livable cities, and (iii) complementary actions. The strategy also aims to promote a \nlarger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure by supporting PPP. \n \n17. \nIn addition to consistency with the strategy's operational priorities, the proposed Project \nwill contribute to achieving results in areas under the strategy\u2019s results framework. The proposed \nProject  will  contribute  to  regional  outcomes  by  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  which \naddresses  the  global  climate  challenge.  Its  contribution  to  country  outcomes  is  significant  in \nimprovement of the urban environment through clean energy and improved MSW management. \nThe Project will contribute to operational effectiveness as well by bundling multiple medium-sized \nWTE projects, which is an innovative structure to reduce transaction costs.   \n \n\n3. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n18. \nADB seeks to meet energy security, facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and \nachieve  ADB\u2019s  vision  of  a  region  free  of  poverty.  ADB  also  seeks  to  help  developing  member \ncountries  (DMCs)  to  provide  reliable,  adequate,  and  affordable  energy  supplies  for  inclusive \ngrowth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. ADB applies three pillars \nfor policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) maximizing \naccess  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform,  capacity  building,  and \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008.

The  existing  and  proposed  WTE  plants  will  generate  renewable  energy  in  an \neconomically  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  The  Project  also  promotes  energy \nefficiency with advanced and cleaner technologies.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\nThe  Project  is  to  support  the  construction  and  operation  through  PPP  of  CEIL's  WTE \n19. \nprojects with advanced clean technologies including grate incinerator technology, and advanced \nflue gas emission control. This will serve the need to treat MSW in secondary cities of the PRC \nand supply electricity to the local grid. Each WTE plant incinerates waste, recovers waste heat for \npower  generation,  purifies  waste  gas,  treats  leachate,  and  disposes  of  ash.  CEEEL,  a  wholly \nowned subsidiary of CEIL, was set up to hold CEIL's WTE operations. The portfolio approach, \nbroad in reach, will enable ADB to provide financing support for multiple WTE projects that are \noften too small for ADB or international banks to finance on a standalone basis. \n\nB. \n\nFinancing Clean Technologies \n\n20. \nDespite  the  recent  policy  shift  in  favor  of  WTE  and  the  increased  interest  of  municipal \ngovernments in clean technologies, market barriers still limit the expansion of WTE projects with \nclean technologies in the PRC. One of the key bottlenecks is the lack of access to finance, leaving \nmunicipalities' demand unmet.   \n \n21. \nAccording to comments obtained through ADB\u2019s Energy Efficiency Initiative consultation \nprocess  and  project  due  diligence,  the  main  reasons  why  financially  viable  clean  technology \nprojects fail to attract finance are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThere  are  gaps  in  clean  technology  knowledge  and  misperceptions  of  actual \ntechnology risks.   \nClean  technologies  require  higher  initial  capital  expenditure,  making  the  total \ninvestment requirement higher, while commercial banks are often unfamiliar with \nenvironment and health benefits that are difficult to quantify. \nThe due diligence costs associated with WTE projects with clean technologies are \nhigh because of the need for technical evaluation regardless of the project size. \nUnder  PPP  arrangements,  municipal  governments  often  require  private  sector \npartners to fund project equity in hard currency. However, availability of long-term \nloan to finance project equity, in US dollar in particular, is limited. \n\n   \n22. \nA window of opportunity exists for ADB to make a real impact in the emerging WTE sector \nwith clean technologies in the PRC. Under the Project, the ADB loan will be provided to a holding \ncompany and channeled to the WTE project companies, playing an anchor role to mobilize local \nfunds and create better awareness among international banks. \n \nC. \n\nSponsor \n\n23. \nSince its establishment in 1993, CEIL has become one of the leading private companies in \nthe environmental protection industry in the PRC. Following the Government\u2019s policy to introduce \nthe  private  sector  participation  in  the  environment  sector  in  2003,  CEIL  has  focused  on \nenvironmental protection infrastructure including WTE and wastewater treatment. CEIL has so far \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nbeen awarded concessions to operate environmental protraction projects in Suzhou, Yixing, and \nChangzhou in Jiangsu Province and Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, and Binzhou in Shandong Province.   \n \n\n1. \n\nShareholders \n\n24. \nCEIL is a private company established in Hong Kong and listed on the main board of the \nHong  Kong  Stock  Exchange  (stock  code  257).  The  majority  shareholder  is  China  Everbright \nHoldings Company Limited (CEHCL), a company established in Hong Kong that holds over 56% \nof  CEIL's  issued  share  capital.  CEHCL  is  owned  by  the  state-owned  China  Everbright  Group, \nwhich is under the supervision of the State Council of the PRC. The group held total assets of \napproximately CNY800 billion in 2007 and had over 18,000 employees.   \n \n\n2. \n\nOperations \n\n25. \nCEIL's  main  environmental  protection  services  include  solid  waste  and  wastewater \ntreatment. As of the end of 2008, CEIL managed 22 environmental protection projects with an \nannual WTE processing capacity of 1.5 million tons, annual on-grid power generation capacity of \n450  GWh,  daily  wastewater  treatment  capacity  of  1.5  million  tons,  and  other  waste  treatment \ncapacity of 20,000 cubic meters per annum.   \n \n26.    CEIL's board of directors has 10 directors, of which seven are executive directors and the \nremaining three are independent nonexecutive directors.   \n \n27. \nCEIL will be responsible for identifying, evaluating, selecting, negotiating, implementing, \nand administering the WTE projects. CEIL aims to set the bar high for the industry by achieving \ninternational best practices and technologies.   \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment, Safety, and Health \n\n28. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  FI  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), and CEIL will adopt an environmental and social management system (ESMS) \nin  compliance  with  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002).  WTE  plants  have  required  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) in the PRC since 2002, and any future WTE subprojects \nidentified for ADB finance will follow the EIA and disclosure procedures as required by both the \nGovernment and ADB. WTE plants have been well regulated in the PRC, with emission standards \nin place, and the implementation of environmental mitigation will be closely monitored by both \nnational and local governments.   \n \nCEIL\u2019s  experience  with  its  existing  plants  ensures  that  the  environmental  impacts \n29. \nassociated  with  WTE  plants  are  well  identified  and  that  adequate  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring  programs  are  in  place.  Flue  gas  emissions  from  the  WTE  plants  will  meet  ADB \nsafeguard  requirements  and  national  standards,  and  CEIL  has  set  out  to  meet  more  stringent \nstandards, such as the European Union II standard for dioxin of 0.10 nanograms (ng) international \ntoxicity equivalent per normal cubic meter (I-TEQ/Nm3), which is 10 times more stringent than the \nChinese requirement and twice as stringent as the World Bank\u2013International Finance Corporation \nstandard  of  0.22  ng  I-TEQ/Nm3.  Fly  ash  will  be  treated  with  solidification  technologies  before \ndisposal  in  designated  landfills.  The  WTE  plant  site  location  will  be  selected  by  the  municipal \ngovernment to minimize environmental impacts on communities and the environment. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n2. \n\nSocial \n\n30. \nThe Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples \ncategory  C.  Land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  needs  are  not \nsignificant  and,  if  needed,  are  normally  carried  out  by  the  municipal  governments  before  the \nconcessions  are  opened  for  competition.  This  means  that  CEIL  has  only  a  limited  role  in  this \nregard. Nonetheless, CEIL will adopt a resettlement framework that sets out the policy principles \nand the screening, due diligence, and resettlement planning process in the event of involuntary \nresettlement, to ensure that national requirements are met and ADB's Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) requirements are complied with in ADB-financed subprojects. As the subprojects \nwill be located in urban areas, the Project will not have significant impact on indigenous peoples.   \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n31. \nThe Project aims to promote environmental improvement in the PRC by contributing to \nresolving urban environmental problems caused by untreated MSW, which contaminates soil and \nemits harmful gasses. The impact of catalyzing private sector investment in the PRC\u2019s emerging \nWTE industry with the deployment of clean technologies will improve the urban environment and \nmitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  avoiding  CH4  emissions  and  replacing  electricity \ngenerated by coal-fired plants.   \n \n32. \nThe Project features a strong model for private sector participation in WTE through a PPP \nfor  multiple  projects  in  medium-sized  municipalities  and  thus  encourages,  with  multi-faceted \ndemonstration effects, the private sector to invest in WTE projects beyond the Project\u2019s specific \ninterventions. First, it will encourage other private investors to invest in WTE projects with clean \ntechnologies. Second, by mobilizing available domestic funds, ADB can create better awareness \namong commercial banks and willingness to finance more WTE projects with clean technologies. \nThird, the Project will demonstrate a new mechanism to provide a long-term, reliable solution to \naddress MSW problems, which is applicable to other municipalities in PRC and in line with the \nGovernment  policy  to  promote  a  resources-saving  society.  TA  will  ensure  information \ndissemination to municipal governments and policy makers. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\nADB's proposed loan is an A-loan of up to $100 million funded by ADB and a B-loan of up \n33. \nto $100 million funded by international banks, made to CEEEL and supported by a full, irrevocable \nguarantee from CEIL. The A-loan will carry an interest rate, as well as commitment and front-end \nfees, to be approved by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit enhancement committee. The Borrower may \nhave the right to convert the interest rate from a floating rate to a fixed rate or vice versa on terms \nagreed between ADB and the Borrower.   \n \n34. \nThe B-loan of up to $100 million will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the \nA-loan and be on terms and conditions agreed by the Borrower, CEIL, participating banks, and \nADB.  ADB  will  charge  an  annual  administration  fee  determined  by  ADB\u2019s  pricing  and  credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Key Activities, and Output \n\nAs ADB's first private sector project to provide assistance to municipal WTE projects, the \n35. \nproposed Project will facilitate the deployment of advanced and clean WTE technologies that do \nnot  require  supplemental  fuel  and  can  therefore  meet  high  environmental  standards,  ensure \nproject implementation, and demonstrate WTE as a solution to MSW disposal in the PRC and \nother DMCs. The lessons learned will be disseminated to municipal governments. The TA will \nhave  two  components:  (i)  assessment  and  evaluation  of  operational  performance  of  the  WTE \nplants,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  in  CEIL  in  environmental  management  in  relation  to  WTE \ntechnologies. The TA is classified as capacity development technical assistance category B.     \n   \n36. \nThe outputs of the TA will be annual reports and a final report prepared by independent \ntechnical advisors and the dissemination of lessons learned on the operation of the WTE plants \nand their applicability to other municipal governments in the PRC and DMCs through seminars \nand conferences, as well as through published reports.   \n \n\n2. \n\nCost and Financing \n\nThe TA is estimated to cost $705,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $653,000 as a \n37. \ngrant through the Clean Energy Fund14  under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nprogram.   \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n38. \nADB,  as  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical \nimplementation  issues,  but  with  full  support  and  cooperation  from  CEIL.  The  outputs  will  be \nmonitored by ADB through consultants' reports, and certain key documents will be reviewed by \nADB and CEIL for approval. ADB and CEIL will form a TA task force comprising representatives at \nappropriate levels from ADB and CEIL, as well as the consultants to be hired. The task force will \ncommunicate regularly to assess needs, monitor progress, and discuss relevant issues. The TA \nwill be implemented intermittently over 54 months from the date its services start. \n \n39. \nConsulting  services  required  for  the  TA  include  17  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 25 person-months of national. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with the simplified technical proposals. The recruitment of the \nfirm will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Disbursements under TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.15 \n \nC. \n\nJustification \n\n40. \nADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified by its development impacts. It supports the \nGovernment\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational strategies, and ADB\u2019s participation will \nadd value to the Project in the following ways: \n\n(i) \n\nThe Project will provide access to clean, reliable, and safe MSW treatment to \npeople living in secondary cities where adequate WTE infrastructure is lacking \n\n                                                 \n14  Contributors are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n15  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nand demand is currently not fully met. It will support the Government's strategic \npriorities for the environment as set forth in the 11th Five Year Plan. The Project \nintroduces a new mechanism to efficiently address both MSW management and \nelectricity  supply,  which  will  help  to  raise  urban  living  standards,  arrest \nenvironmental degradation, and advance sustainable urban development. This \nwill particularly benefit the urban poor, who suffer severely from air and water \npollution.   \nThe Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC, which is based on \nfour development objectives, one of which is environmental improvement. The \nProject  will  embody  ADB's  Strategy  2020,  which  emphasizes  more  support  in \nADB's lending portfolio for environmentally sustainable development and private \nsector  development.  The  Project  seeks  to  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental  impacts.  By  introducing  clean  technologies  to  utilize  abundant \nMSW  as  fuel,  the  Project  will  address  regional  environmental  problems  and \nmitigate greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe  Project  will  support  a  series  of  medium-sized  WTE  projects  with  clean \ntechnologies  to  be  built  through  PPP.  It  will  contribute  to  the  introduction  and \ntransfer  of  state-of-the-art  technologies  to  be  utilized  to  address  urban \nwaste-management problems, which is in line with ADB public sector efforts and \ncan be used by the Government as a model for other projects. TA will ensure \ninformation dissemination to municipal governments and policy makers.   \nThe  Project  has  pioneering  features  that  embody  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations policy in the PRC. As a multi-project facility, the Project will enable \nADB to extend its reach to multiple municipal WTE projects that would be difficult \nto  assist  directly,  while  leveraging  the  experience  and  know-how  of  an \nexperienced  developer.  The  ADB  loan  in  US  dollar  is  essential  for  a  holding \ncompany to invest in US dollar as often required and will act as a leverage to \nmobilize local currency financing from local banks, which are unfamiliar with the \nclean technologies that the Project will employ.   \n\nAnticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\nCEIL  and  CEEEL  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to \n41. \ndate)  and  policy  relating  to  the  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism \n(2003).  Consistent  with its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nADB  will  require  CEIL  and  CEEEL  and  its  subsidiaries  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant \nwith ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB, CEIL, and \nCEEEL  will  further  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these \nundertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank 16 ,  the \n42. \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed loan. No funding \nwill be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation.   \n \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank.
