THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi Pingxiang Integrated Rural\u2013Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  contribute  to  socially  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  and \ncompetitive urban\u2013rural development in Pingxiang municipality in Jiangxi Province. The project \nwill be a model for integrated rural\u2013urban development, by supporting towns and bringing \nservices closer to people; combining flood risk management and environmentally sustainable \nriver  rehabilitation,  improved  wastewater  management,  and  rural\u2013urban  transport;  and \ndeveloping institutional capacity to ensure project sustainability.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Pingxiang is a poverty-stricken, resource-depleted, mountainous city with a population of \n1.87 million and an area of 3,827 square kilometers. The city is (i) in the western portion of the \npoor, flood disaster-stricken Jiangxi Province; (ii) 70 kilometers (km) east of the Chang-Zhu-Tan \ncity-cluster;  and  (iii)  connected  to  national  highways  and  to  the  high-speed  rail  network.3 \nDevelopment in Pingxiang has lagged significantly behind national averages and was chosen as \none of 12 cities nationwide to showcase industrial transformation, from an economy based on \nresource extraction to one that is more diverse.4 Pingxiang experiences serious floods and \nenvironmental pollution, and was chosen to become a pilot city for climate-proof, \u201csponge\u201d city \ndevelopment.5 Pingxiang\u2019s urbanization ratio is low and rural poverty is high, and the city was \nchosen to implement an innovative approach to rural\u2013urban integration in Jiangxi Province, one \nthat delivers infrastructure and jobs in closer proximity to rural residents. 6 \n \n4.  The per capita gross domestic product in Pingxiang\u2019s counties is about half that in the \nurban core, which is in turn about half that of nearby Changsha.7 Lianhua is a national poverty \ncounty,  and  there  are  113  designated  poverty  villages  in  the  municipality.  The  Pingxiang \nmunicipal government (PMG) Resource-Depleted Transitional Development Plan (2013\u20132020) \npromotes balanced and sustainable urban\u2013rural development and aims to (i) expand and link \nthe  centers  of  Anyuan  and  Xiangdong  districts,  with  an  expected  combined  population  of \n800,000 by 2020; and (ii) strengthen county-level cities as subcenters in Lianhua, Luxi, and \nShangli counties, with a population of 70,000\u2013120,000 residents in each by 2020. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Jiangxi  Pingxiang  Integrated  Rural\u2013Urban \nInfrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 8451-PRC). \n3  Jiangxi is a key source province of floating migrant worker population to the eastern PRC. Chang-Zhu-Tan is an \nabbreviation for the Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan city cluster. In 2007, the National Development and Reform \nCommission approved the city cluster as pilot for integration of resource efficient and sustainable development. \n4  Pingxiang was among 12 cities in the PRC to be classified as resource-depleted city, and is eligible for national \ngovernment support for industrial transformation. Pingxiang depends on resource-based industries such as coal \nand iron mining, steel, aluminum, industrial ceramics, chemical, and fireworks. Agriculture remains important, \nespecially in Lianhua County. \n5  Sponge city is a concept in which greenways, parks, and wetlands maximize ecosystem services, including water \nresource  management  and  stormwater  retention.  In  April  2015,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  Urban  and  Rural \nDevelopment announced that Pingxiang was selected as one of 16 pilot cities for the sponge city program. \n6  The urbanization ratio (31.6%) is lower than the national average (53.7%); rural poverty is significant at 18.6%. \n7  In 2011, Pingxiang\u2019s average urban income was CNY18,646, compared with a national average of CNY21,810. ", "2 \n5.  Flood risk-reduction is a top priority in Pingxiang. Flood frequency and severity have \nincreased significantly since 1998. Floods in 1998, 2001, 2002, 2010, and 2014 affected more \nthan 496,000 people, caused the collapse of more than 2,600 houses, and resulted in significant \neconomic losses in agriculture. A major flood on 25 May 2014 severely impacted public safety \nand health, and caused an estimated $115 million in economic losses.8 Most riverbanks in \nPingxiang have inadequate flood protection; sediment accumulation from riverbank erosion and \nmining has raised riverbeds, further reducing the flood discharge capacity of rivers. \n \n6.  Pingxiang is a headwater municipality; all its rivers originate in the mountainous areas, \nand flow into two river systems: (i) the Gan River, which drains northeast into Poyang Lake; and \n(ii) the Xiang River, which flows northwest into Dongting Lake. Where rivers flow through \nfarmland, settlements, and industrial and mining areas they collect pollutants and sediments. At \nthe end of 2012, the urban wastewater treatment rate in Pingxiang was 75.8%, well below the \nnational average. Many small cities and townships lack or have incomplete sewer systems, and \nno wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Domestic wastewater is discharged untreated into \nrivers, affecting downstream jurisdictions and Poyang Lake.9 Illegal solid waste disposal along \nrivers is common, particularly in rural areas without regular collection. Some rivers in Pingxiang \nprovide drinking water for local communities, and pollution poses serious risks to public health.10 \n \n7.  Pingxiang\u2019s rural areas have limited access to markets, jobs, training, education, and \nservices  in  towns  and  cities. The  lack  of  adequate  roads  and  public  transport  limits rural \ndevelopment, jobs, and livelihood opportunities. Except for the main east\u2013west and north\u2013south \ncorridors served by highways and national roads, many existing roads in Pingxiang are narrow \nand poorly maintained, particularly in the rural and mountainous areas. \n \n8.  Pingxiang is focused on developing its core urban area, with less priority given to the \ndevelopment of rural areas. Continued unbalanced and disconnected development will result in \nan  increasing  social,  economic,  and  environmental  divide  between  urban  and  rural  areas. \nPingxiang  is  approaching  its  challenges  with  non-integrated  engineering,  which  addresses \nproblems from one dimension, while typically generating new problems in other areas. Non-\nintegrated approaches to flood protection\u2014which typically comprise solid walls and concrete \ndikes\u2014force  stormwater  into  a  channel,  potentially  causing  downstream  flash  floods  and \ndegrading river environments; this harms river ecology, and the lack of natural capacity to \nabsorb rainwater runoff that flows into rivers necessitates increased investment compared with \nan integrated approach that strategically preserve floodplains. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project supports the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) and the \nPRC\u2019s  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan  (2014\u20132020)  by  contributing  to  balanced \nurbanization with livable, eco-efficient, and inclusive cities; and Pingxiang\u2019s development, flood \nrisk  management,  and  transportation  plans.11 The  project  (i)  is  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); (ii) is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the PRC; (iii) supports \nADB\u2019s (a) Strategy 2020 goal of livable and sustainable cities through creation of cleaner and \nhealthier environments; (b) urban operational plan that aims at inclusive, green, and competitive \nurban  development;  (c)  water  operational  plan  aiming  at  integrated  water  resources \n                                                \n8  During the rainy season in April\u2013June, flood events have a duration of several days. Water levels rise by up to four \nmeters above normal levels for a 20-year flood (one that is likely to occur once every 20 years). \n9  The PRC categorizes surface water quality into five classes: from I (best) to V (worst). Classes I\u2013III can be used for \ndrinking water. Most project rivers currently do not meet class III. \n10 Water safety plans have been prepared for the PMG and county and/or district governments, and identify water \nsafety risks. Risks in the project rivers will be addressed by the loan using structural and nonstructural measures. \n11 This plan will serve as a blueprint for urbanization policies in the PRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan. ", "3 \nmanagement; and (d) sustainable transport initiative operational plan in its objective to support \nrural roads; and (iv) provides innovative solutions as emphasized in ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy  2020,  complementing  physical  with  nonstructural  measures  in  flood  risk \nmanagement.12  \n \n10.  Incorporation of lessons. The project incorporates lessons from similar ADB loan and \ntechnical assistance projects in the PRC and in Jiangxi Province.13 Lessons include (i) planning \nwastewater facilities that follow rigorous demand analysis, and conducting policy dialogue on \ncost recovery to support investment sustainability; (ii) reducing adverse impacts on rural roads \nthrough road and pedestrian safety, intersection design improvement, and public transport; and \n(iii) reducing resettlement impact and cost through optimization of project design.14 \n \n11.  Pilot features. The project includes best practices and pilot demonstration features. \nBest  practices  include  (i)  linking  and  functionally  integrating  infrastructure  to  optimize \ndevelopment impacts, including river, wastewater, and road components; (ii) implementation of \nnational  regulations  on  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  (promulgated  by  the  government  and \nprepared  with  ADB  assistance)  established  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \nparticipation (as regulations require full cost recovery), mainly for the water supply sector in \nPingxiang;15 and (iii) road alignment optimization through the study of alternatives to minimize \nand balance resettlement and environmental impacts. Pilot demonstration features include: \n(i)   Urban\u2013rural flood risk management and climate resilience partnerships. \nRiver embankments, floodplain preservation, and adaptable weirs protect urban \nand rural settlements, while ensuring the irrigation needs of farmers are met. As \nrecommended in the climate risk and vulnerability assessment, small concrete \ndams will be reconstructed as adjustable hydraulic tilting gate weirs to enhance \nclimate  variability  and  change  adaptation  capacity. 16 During  project \nimplementation, nonstructural climate adaptation measures (i.e., improved river \nmaintenance, flood monitoring, early warning, and disaster response systems) \nwill be implemented.17 A water resource management plan will be developed and \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n16 Initial climate risk screening determined that the project is at medium risk from climate change effects. A project-\nlevel climate risk and vulnerability assessment confirmed that design assumptions for flood control works were \nadequate. River embankments have a safety buffer freeboard of 0.5\u20130.7 meters that can accommodate projected \nincreases in precipitation resulting from climate change until at least 2050. \n17 Counties and districts have fairly effective flood information systems. In Luxi County, short messages are sent to all \nresidents\u2019 mobile phones to warn of flood events. ", "4 \nfarmers will be trained in advanced crop production that is more flood-resilient, \nand will likely increase their incomes.18  \n(ii)   Ecological river management supporting sustainable urban\u2013rural sponge \ncity  development.  Replanted  riparian  embankments,  rural  agricultural \nshelterbelts, protection of wetland floodplains, and public green space along the \nriver  will  accommodate  seasonal  water  level  fluctuations  and  increase \nstormwater  retention  capacity.  The  ecologically  designed  greenways  will \nenhance habitat biodiversity and water quality through filtration by green buffer \nzones. Implementation of water safety plans through capacity building and policy \ndialogue on pollution reduction will further enhance sustainability.19 \n(iii)   Community-based  environment  supervision  and  roads  safety  education \nteams  (CERTs).  They  will  develop  and  implement  community  environment \nmanagement  rules  to  foster  environmentally  sustainable  behavior,  including \norderly solid waste disposal. CERTs will also facilitate community-awareness on \nroad safety and maintenance and discuss public transportation and bus stop \nlocations with the government in the areas adjacent to the rural\u2013urban road.20  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The  impacts  will  be  improved  integrated  and  green  urban\u2013rural  development;  and \nimproved socioeconomic wellbeing of residents in cities, townships, and villages in Pingxiang \nmunicipality and Jiangxi Province. The outcome will be improved living conditions of rural and \nurban residents using integrated infrastructure in Pingxiang. \n \n13.  Responding  to  the  need  of  an  integrated  approach,  the  project  will  address  key \nchallenges of flooding, river pollution, untreated wastewater, and lack of rural\u2013urban linkages in \na connected and holistic manner. It will contribute to more sustainable and inclusive urban\u2013rural \ndevelopment in Pingxiang by strategically focusing investments on four subcenters in Lianhua, \nLuxi, and Shangli counties, and Xiangdong District; and on two key townships in Luxi and \nShangli counties. It will promote a more distributed urban\u2013rural system to support government \nplans and recent growth of these cities.21 The strengthened subcenters will bring jobs, goods, \nassets, and public and private services within the commuting distance of more villages and \ntownships, enabling more inclusive growth.22 The project will increase flood resilience, enhance \nthe river environment, and improve wastewater management. A total of about 308,000 farmers \nand rural and urban residents will benefit directly from reduced flood risk. The improved river \nenvironment will include recreational and public health benefits of accessible, continuous, and \nenvironmentally sustainable greenways linking urban and rural areas in the four subcenters, and \nserving about 400,000 residents by 2020. About 175,000 residents will benefit directly from \nexpanded  and  improved  wastewater  management  services.  Additional  benefits  include \nimproved quality of life, increased real estate values, and reduced expenses and risks from \nfloods and waterborne diseases. Also, the project will reduce pollutants entering the Xiang and \nGan river systems. The rural\u2013urban road will support inclusive development by connecting \nvillages,  townships,  subcenters,  schools,  and  industrial  areas  in  the  two  fastest-growing \n                                                \n18 Additional income for farmers will be promoted through value-added activities in food processing and agri-tourism. \n19 Water safety plans were developed during project preparation for Lianhua and Shangli counties, where project \nrivers serve as drinking water sources. The project will implement measures to reduce water safety risks. \n20 Details are in the procurement and consulting services section and in the social development action plan of the \nProject Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Average annual urban growth rates were very high in Lianhua (9.7%), Luxi (7.8%), and Shangli (15.8%), but lower \nin Anyuan and Xiangdong districts (2.7% combined). \n22 One challenge of urban\u2013rural integration (including in Pingxiang) is the separation of families. Elderly people and \nchildren remain in villages, while working-age people live and work in urban areas. ", "5 \ncounties of Luxi and Shangli, directly benefitting about 247,000 residents. The subcomponents \nare spatially and functionally linked to maximize mutual benefits and development impact. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project takes a strategic and holistic approach, with four key outputs covering all \nrural counties and urban districts within Pingxiang municipality. \n \n15.  Output 1: Flood risk management and river rehabilitation improved and integrated. \nThis component comprises works on 71 km of eight rural\u2013urban rivers in Lianhua, Luxi, and \nShangli counties; and Xiangdong District including (i) river widening and removal of sediments, \n(ii) new and rehabilitated embankments, (iii) about 90 hectares (ha) of riparian revegetation, (iv) \nabout 46 ha of wetland protection and rehabilitation, (v) construction or reconstruction of 35 \nsmall adaptable weirs for farmland irrigation, and (vi) construction of two new pedestrian bridges \n(Lianhua  and  Luxi)  and  reconstruction  of  one  local  bridge  (Luxi).  Nonstructural  measures \nincluded in output 4 enhance the effectiveness of the flood protection infrastructure.23 \n \n16.  Output 2: Wastewater collection and treatment improved. This component includes \nimprovement and expansion of sewer pipe networks in subcenters of Lianhua County and \nXiangdong District and construction of two sewer networks and WWTPs in two townships. A \ntotal  of  about  184  km  of  new  sewer  mains,  secondary  sewers,  and  interceptors  will  be \ninstalled.24 A new WWTP and pump station with 5,000 cubic meters (m3) per day capacity will \nbe built in Xuanfeng Town in Luxi County, and a new WWTP and pump station with 2,500 m3 \nper day capacity will be built in Tongmu Town in Shangli County.25 \n \n17.  Output 3: Rural\u2013urban linkages improved. This component includes a 44 km rural\u2013\nurban class II road with a width of 10 meters (m), six bridges with a total length of 953 m, and a \n482 m tunnel. The road is one of the four bypass roads in the Pingxiang Integrated Transport \nPlan (2012). The road will link towns and villages to urban and industrial areas in Luxi and \nShangli counties, and Anyuan District; and expand the existing road network in the project area \nto improve traffic capacity, and reduce transport costs and travel time for people and goods. \n \n18.  Output 4: Inclusive capacity in project planning and management and in urban\u2013\nrural  integration  developed.  Loan  implementation  consultants  will  support  project \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation. They will carry out capacity development programs, \nstudy tours, policy dialogue, and stakeholder consultation on (i) procurement and financial \nmanagement; (ii) urban\u2013rural flood risk management and climate resilience partnership (i.e., \ndevelopment of flood early warning systems, disaster response plans, and guidance on water \nresource management plans); (iii) ecological river management supporting sustainable urban\u2013\nrural  sponge  city  development;  (iv)  wastewater  management  system  design,  construction, \nmanagement, operation, and service and tariff reform; and rural wastewater and sanitation; (v) \nrural  road  and  traffic  safety,  sustainable  rural\u2013urban  transport,  and  public  transport \nmanagement; and (vi) urban\u2013rural development and governance partnership development. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $361.24 million (Table 1). \n                                                \n23 It will meet government requirements for flood protection for (i) urban areas for 20-year flood events (occurring \nonce every 20 years), (ii) rural villages for 10-year flood events, and (iii) farmland for 5-year flood events. \n24 Sewer connections of titled properties will be installed by property owners or developers. For all other households, \nconnections will be installed under the project. \n25 The Xuanfeng Town WWTP will also serve Yinhe Town. The two towns have combined water supply systems with \n8,000 m3 per day total capacity. Tongmu town has water supply capacity of 3,000 m3 per day.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $150  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; follow the straight-line repayment method; and have an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements.26 The loan will finance civil works (94%), equipment (4%), \ncapacity development (2%), and other eligible expenditures. The local governments will finance \nthe balance of costs not financed by ADB, including land acquisition and resettlement cost, \ndesign, site supervision, and management cost. The PRC Ministry of Finance will relend the \nentire loan to Jiangxi provincial government, which will onlend the loan proceeds to the PMG, \nwhich will onlend to the county and district governments on the same terms and conditions as \nthe ADB loan. The county and district governments will bear the foreign exchange and interest \nrate variation risks in proportion to the loan amount they receive.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  All project components were prepared by licensed domestic design institutes taking into \naccount consultant recommendations during project preparation, local conditions, topography, \nand climate in accordance with relevant PRC design guidelines and local regulations. WWTP \nprocesses have been selected considering the limited capacity for operation and maintenance \n(O&M). Sensitivity analysis of flood control components shows that design assumptions and \nproposed structures are adequate to accommodate increased precipitation (based on climate \nchange forecasting). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis indicates the project is economically viable, \nwith an overall economic internal rate of return of 17.8% and an economic net present value of \nCNY704 million. The rates of return for the individual outputs are 18.6% for the river component, \n12.4% for improved wastewater collection and treatment, and 18.8% for the rural\u2013urban road. \nThe wastewater subcomponent in Lianhua County, a designated national poverty county, has \nan economic internal rate of return of 9.7%, lower than the economic opportunity cost of capital ", "8 \nof 12%. Actual benefits are likely larger as several were not quantified (e.g., public health, \necosystems services, and others). Sensitivity analysis shows that project viability can withstand \npotential variations in costs and benefits. The project remains economically viable even with a \ncombination of a benefit decline of 20.0% and a capital cost increase of 20.0%. \n \n25.  Financial analysis. The financial sustainability assessment for the project indicated that \nthe local governments have sufficient funds to finance the counterpart contributions and to \nfinance debt service and O&M costs during operation. Average annual counterpart funding \naccounts for 1.1% of projected local government revenues during implementation. Annual debt \nservice ranges from 1.0% to 3.2% of projected revenues in 2021. Annual funds required for \nfacility  O&M  averages  less  than  1%  of  projected  revenues  during  the  operational  period. \nFinancial evaluation of the two WWTPs determined that full cost recovery is not possible at \nreasonable tariff assumptions, given the small scale of the WWTPs. However, the wastewater \ntariff can provide full recovery of O&M costs. The operating margin (estimated based on current \ntariff levels and full O&M cost recovery) is 16% for Tongmu WWTP and 22% for Xuanfeng \nWWTP. This component will generate a positive operating margin even under a stress scenario \n(10% reduction in tariff revenue and 5% increase in O&M cost). \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Based  on  the  financial  management  assessment,  key  financial  management  risks \nidentified are lack of knowledge of ADB financial management policies and procedures, lack of \nstandardized procedures, and inadequate budget planning processes for project implementation. \nGiven the participation of counties and districts, it is concluded that the overall pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk of executing and implementing agencies is moderate. To address the \nrisks, key mitigating measures include training of relevant staff on procurement, disbursement, \nand financial reporting requirements prior to loan effectiveness; and development of manuals. \nWith  these  measures,  financial  management  arrangements  are  deemed  adequate.  A \nprocurement  risk  assessment  of  PMG  and  the  project  management  office  confirmed  that \ncapacity is adequate given assistance by a procurement agency to prepare and arrange all \nprocurement activities according to the PRC\u2019s domestic rules, ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time), and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with PMG and county and district governments. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project will (i) contribute to poverty reduction by reducing flood risk for a population \nof  about  308,000,  including  about  37,000  poor  people;  (ii)  provide  improved  wastewater \nservices for 175,000 residents; and (iii) directly benefit 247,000 people residing within 2 km of \nthe rural\u2013urban road. It is estimated that a total of more than 4,600 jobs will be created by the \nproject  during  construction,  with  200  jobs  during  operation.  The  PMG  and  project \nimplementation units will ensure that all PRC labor laws and core labor standards are followed. \n \n28.  A social development action plan was prepared for the project to ensure participation of \ncommunities in project design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Actions include \n(i)  participation  in  public  awareness  campaigns  on  the  disaster  preparedness  system  and \nenvironmental  and  public  health  education;  (ii)  consultation  and  information  disclosure  on \nWWTPs, sludge disposal, and transportation; (iii) participation in public hearings on wastewater \ntariffs; (iv) targets for employment of local labor, women, and the poor during construction and ", "9 \noperation;  and  (v)  establishment  of  CERTs  to  design  and  implement  awareness-raising \ncampaigns and education programs. Social and gender indicators will be included in the project \nperformance  management  system,  and  adequate  consultant  inputs for  implementation  and \nmonitoring are included in the loan implementation consultant package. \n \n29.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Women strongly support \nthe project and expect improvement of the environment, their quality of life, and employment \nand income opportunities. A gender action plan was prepared, including specific targets for \nwomen in employment, participation, and decision-making.28 The plan will help to ensure (i) \nincreased opportunities for female employment (at least 30%), (ii) participation and gender-\nsensitive awareness campaigns and education programs on disaster preparedness system and \npublic road safety with up to 50% female participation, (iii) participation in decision-making and \ncapacity-building activities through the establishment of CERTs (30% female members) and \ncommunity-based groups (50% female members), (iv) sex-disaggregated data collection, and \n(v) implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan indicators. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment (category A). A project environmental impact assessment, including an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  and  disclosed  in  May  2015  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, including ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The environmental impact assessment incorporates findings from a biodiversity and \nhabitat survey  and fishery  resource  impact  assessments  in  the  Pingshui  and  Yuan  rivers. \nPotential impacts of the planned river rehabilitation include significant earthwork and sediment \ndredging,  and  damage  to  in-channel  habitats  potentially  impacting  the  two  fish  protection \nzones.29 The proposed rural\u2013urban road will involve cut and fill along the road corridor, which \nwill  likely  cause  soil  erosion,  dust,  construction  noise  and  vibration,  and  community  and \noccupational health and safety risks. Most impacts will be localized, short-term, and can be \neffectively mitigated through the application of good construction and housekeeping practices \ndefined in the EMP. An institutional strengthening and capacity building program is defined in \nthe EMP to ensure PMG\u2019s capacity to manage and monitor environmental impacts and risks.  \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will acquire 171.02 ha of land, of \nwhich 115.61 ha is farmland, affecting 3,379 households with 13,672 persons. There will be \ntemporary occupation of 122.53 ha of land. About 262 households and 1,022 persons will lose \n51,636.57 square meters of residential housing and 3,309 square meters of small shops. A total \nof 4,207 households with 17,045 persons will be affected by the project, out of which 1,059 \nhouseholds with 4,327 persons will lose more than 10% of their productive assets and/or will be \nphysically displaced. Nearly 325 households with 395 persons are vulnerable and 13 belong to \nethnic groups. Five resettlement plans consistent with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement were \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website. Compensation for lost assets and allowances will \nbe  at  replacement  costs  and  will  be  paid  to  affected  persons  prior  to  displacement. \nResettlement information booklets were disclosed to the community, village offices, and to \naffected persons in the local language in April 2015. Each project implementation unit will have \nat least one fulltime resettlement staff member to carry out internal monitoring and supervision. \nThe  implementing  agencies  possess  good  capacity  to  implement  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. Training on ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and procedures will be provided \nto ensure proper implementation. A grievance redress mechanism will be established and an \nindependent agency will be engaged to conduct semiannual external monitoring and evaluation. \n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Approximately 3.55 million m3 of soil will be excavated during rehabilitation of the project rivers.
