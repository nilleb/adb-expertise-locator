Responding \ndirectly to the needs of the population in the project area, it will upgrade existing  water supply \nnetworks,  provide  potable  water  treatment  services,  build  institutional  capacity,  and  assist  in \nstrengthening the province\u2019s water supply and wastewater utility.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  water  supply  and sanitation (WSS) systems  in Uzbekistan  were  established under \nthe former Soviet Union. These were all owned and operated by public enterprises, supervised \nby government ministries, and funded from the central budget. The sector is undergoing reforms \nto  address  the  challenges  of  (i)  inadequate  investment  and  services  coverage,  (ii)  poor \noperation and maintenance (O&M), (iii) financial unsustainability, and (iv) weak institutional and \nregulatory capacity. Most of the vodokanals (water supply and sanitation agencies) have started \nto  adopt  modern  management  and  commercial  practices  to  improve  their  accountability  and \nprovide incentives to improve services. The results are manifested in terms of improvements in \nthe coverage, quality, reliability, and sustainability of WSS services. \n \n4. \nSince independence in 1991, growth in Uzbekistan has been attained through a gradual \ntransition to a market-based economy, evolving from an initial emphasis on welfare and social \nstability towards economic and social development that is supported by strong macroeconomic \nmanagement.  The  nation\u2019s  robust  economic  growth  prospects  highlight  the  need  for  improved \nmunicipal  infrastructure  and  services,  underscoring  the  demand  for  sustainable  infrastructure \ninvestments coupled with the progressive modernization of service delivery utilities. \n \nThe  demand  for  municipal  service  improvements  is  pronounced  in  Tashkent  province, \n5. \nwhich\u2014as the  home of Tashkent  city, the  nation\u2019s  capital\u2014is  the  country's  most  economically \nadvanced  province.  The  districts  of  Kibray  and  Zangiota  typify  the  province\u2019s  18  towns  and \ndistricts.3 Located adjacent to Tashkent city, they are destined to contribute substantially to the \nprovince\u2019s  economic  growth  and  to  strengthen  its  urban\u2013rural  linkages.  Both  districts  have \nconsiderable  expansion  potential  in  the  agro-industrial  area  and  textile  industries.  Zangiota  is \nalso identified as a possible location for a future special industrial zone. \n \nDespite  its  strong  economic  growth  potential,  however,  the  province  suffers  from \n6. \ninadequate  WSS \nfragmented  and \ndysfunctional  regulatory  and  institutional  frameworks,  limited  planning  capabilities,  weak \ninteragency  coordination  and  oversight,  and  ineffective  regulatory  compliance  mechanisms. \nVodokanals  lack  performance-based  management,  and  have  high  staff  turnover.  Funding \nconstraints have also been acute for both capital investments and O&M activities, exacerbated \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Tashkent Province \n\ninfrastructure.  Historically,  WSS  has  suffered \n\nfrom \n\nWater Supply Development Project.  \n\n3  Kibray  district  has  a  population  of  190,000  and  is  25  kilometers  from  Tashkent  city.  Zangiota  district  has  a \n\npopulation of about 390,000 and is 17 kilometers from Tashkent city. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nby  low  tariff  levels,  collection  inefficiencies,  and  limited  public  funding.  Significant  inequalities \nexist in the provision of WSS services, particularly between cities and towns.  \n \n7. \nDeficiencies  in WSS  have  also  manifested  physically.  In  2012,  although  the  province\u2019s \nwater  supply  coverage  was  estimated  to  be  85.9%,  many  consumers  endured  irregular  and \nintermittent water supplies. Much of the province\u2019s water supply infrastructure has deteriorated \nand  needs  extensive  rehabilitation,  resulting  in  unreliable  services,  high  leakage  losses,  and \nelevated  water  pollution  risks.  Inefficient  pumps  and  frequent  power  outages  further  inhibit \ndelivery. In Kibray and Zangiota districts, households and businesses are hampered by frequent \nwater supply interruptions, forcing them to use alternative water supply sources such as shallow \nwells,  stand  pipes,  and  trucked  water.  Water  production  headworks,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  facilities  within  the  two  districts  increasingly  face  obsolescence  as  a  result  of \nmaintenance deficiencies. This low level of service provision impacts directly on consumers and \nhinders the growth of the province.   \n \n8. \nFully  recognizing  the  WSS  constraints,  the  government,  through  the  leadership  of  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Uzbekistan  Agency  (UCSA),4 responded  by  reorganizing \nWSS  institutions  and  implementing  broad  management,  financial,  and  cost-recovery  reforms. \nDriven largely through the Decree of Cabinet of Ministers (DCM) 306 dated 30 October 2015,5  \nsuvokovas (state unitary enterprises) have been established in each province, with each being \nmandated  to  deliver  WSS  improvements  in  its  respective  jurisdiction.  In  parallel,  previously \nindependent  city  and  district  vodokanals  have  been  restructured  and  absorbed  as  district \nbranches into their respective provincial suvokovas. DCM 306 also requires that two high-level \ncommittees be established and over 40 time-bound WSS improvements be implemented. One \ncommittee  will  ensure  the  recruitment  of  qualified  management  personnel  for  suvokovas,  and \nthe  other  committee  will  monitor  the  timely  servicing  of  WSS  loans  of  international  financial \ninstitutions. In Tashkent province, WSS delivery is the responsibility of the Tashkent Provincial \nSuvokova  (TPS).  Since  its  formation,  it  has  progressed  rapidly  to  implement  WSS  reforms: \ncompleting inventories of its  18 district branches, expanding its consumer base,6 increasing its \ntariffs,  improving  tariff  collection  efficiencies,  consolidating  unregistered  water  supply  systems, \nand  recruiting  professional  and  support  personnel.  Water  tariffs  have  increased  significantly\u2014\nbetween  April  2013  and  March  2016,  the  domestic  water  tariff  increased  by  209%  in  Kibray \ndistrict and 89% in Zangiota  district. These ongoing reforms will provide an increasingly stable \nfoundation on which to develop much-needed water supply investments. \n  \n9. \nThe project will revitalize the Kadirya regional water supply system. This includes a 58-\nkilometer  (km)  urban  corridor  of  Tashkent  province  that  will  initially  serve  over  260,000 \ninhabitants  of  Kibray  and  Zangiota.  These  districts  have  been  selected  due  to  their  economic \nimportance,  proximity  to  the  regional  water  source,  and  poor  WSS  standards.   The  project  is \nconsistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  and \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for  Uzbekistan.7 It  also  conforms  with  and  supports \nrelevant government decrees relating to WSS, and is consistent with previous and ongoing ADB \n\n                                                \n4   The  UCSA  is  a  central  government  body  with  overall  responsibility  to  improve  WSS  services  nationwide.  It \nformulates  policy,  advises  on  reforms  and  decrees,  and  is  a  focal  executing  agency  for  foreign  investments  in \nWSS. \n\n5  DCM 306 \"On measures to implement the main directions of development of the organizations of water supply and \n\nsanitation\" enacted by the Cabinet of Ministers on 30 October 2015. \n\n6  The domestic consumer base increased from 0.78 million to 1.17 million, and the commercial and institutional base \n\n7   ADB.  2012.

The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  improved  access  to  reliable,  sustainable,  and \naffordable water supply services in Kibray and Zangiota districts of Tashkent province.   \n \nC. \n \n11. \n\nThe project will have two outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Kadirya regional water supply system improved. Output 1 will consist \nof a new potable water treatment plant (WTP) producing 105,000 m3 of water daily, \n58.3  km  of  water  transmission  mains,  8  new  and  9  rehabilitated  pumping  stations, \n27.2 km of distribution main pipes, and 337.8 km of distribution networks.  \n\nOutputs \n\n(ii)  Output  2:  Improved  financial,  operational,  and  system  management  of  the \nTashkent  Provincial  Suvokova  for  Kibray  and  Zangiota  district  branches. \nOutput 2 will improve the financial, operational, and system management of the TPS, \nincluding the provision of training for technical and financial management, assistance \nwith  the  establishment  of  customer  care  units  at  the  Zangiota  and  Kibray  district \nbranches,  installation  of  household  water  meters,  and  implementation  of  a \ncomputerized financial management system. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plan  \n \nThe project is estimated to cost $143.83 million (Table 1).  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \n\nInvestment program management and capacity development \nSubtotal (A)  \n\n  \nBase Costb \n1.

Benefits  are  derived  primarily \n\nconstructed  to  produce  105,000  cubic  meters  of  drinking  water  daily,  sufficient  to  cover  the \nprojected water demand of the proposed service area for at least a 25-year horizon. About 423 \nkm  of  pipelines,12 integrated  with  existing  distribution  systems  and  17  pumping  stations,  will \nsecure  the  distribution  of  safe  and  continuous  drinking  water  through  the  proposed  regional \nwater  supply  system.  Potential  nonrevenue  water    issues  will  be  addressed  primarily  through \nthe  implementation  of  universal  consumer  metering.  Fiberglass  and  polyethylene  pipes, \ncharacterized  by  extremely  low  roughness  coefficients,  will  be  utilized  in  the  network.  The \nproposed technology is compatible with local conditions and the capacity of the TPS. \n \nB. \n \n21. \nincremental  water \nconsumption  calculated  according  to  the  willingness  to  pay  of  the  consumers,  existing  water \ndemand,  and  water  demand  projections;  and  (ii)  resource  cost  savings  from  nonincremental \nwater  sales  as  a  result  of  households  switching  from  alternative  water  sources.  The  public \nhealth  benefits  from  the  project  were  quantified  by  estimating  the  medical  savings  from \nimproved  access  to  clean  water  and  the  savings  in  the  disability-adjusted  life  years  stemming \nfrom the reduced exposure to untreated water. The resulting base-case economic internal rate \nof  return  is  14.54%,  which  exceeds  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%,  which \nconfirms  the  economic  viability  of  the  project.  A  sensitivity  analysis,  undertaken  to further  test \neconomic  viability,  determined  that  the  project  will  remain  economically  robust  under  the \nfollowing  scenarios:  (i)  a  10%  increase  in  investment  cost  possibly  arising  from  a  delayed \nimplementation  schedule  or  inflation  being  higher  than  expected;  (ii)  a  10%  increase  in  O&M \ncosts, which can result from personnel salaries and other costs being higher than budgeted; (iii) \na 10%  decline  in benefits  possibly  resulting from  consumption  benefits, resource  savings,  and \nhealth benefits being lower than projected; (iv) a combination of scenarios (i), (ii), and (iii); and \n(v) a delay in subproject benefits by 1 year.  \n  \nFinancial analysis. Government sector reforms, including DCM 306, define the plan for \n22. \nfinancial sustainability of provincial suvokovas. Accordingly, the financial sustainability analysis \nis  conducted  from  the  perspective  of  the  TPS,  the  entity  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmanagement  of  WSS  in  Tashkent  province.  Although  the  tariff  adjustment  methodology  is \ndesigned to allow the TPS to recover O&M costs, depreciation, and interest on borrowings, it is \ninsufficient  to  cover  principal  repayment  of  debt  service.  The  TPS  does,  however,  have  a  \nconsistent track record of 6-monthly tariff revisions, which is sufficient to allow it to fully recover \nits operating costs, ensuring sustainable operations. The tariff therefore is insufficient to yield a \npositive financial internal rate of return, and a full cost\u2013benefit analysis has not been performed. \nAs the project will lead to the addition of net fixed assets of about SUM600 billion in 2022 (about \n20  times  the  net  fixed  assets  in  the  books  of  the  TPS  as  of  2016),  tariffs  will  need  to  be \nincreased by about 47% in real terms in 2022 to accommodate the higher depreciation charges \nand interest costs of the ADB loan.13 The newly formed TPS will also need to invest substantial \nadditional  amounts  in  the  future  for  the  remaining  portions  of  its  network,  although  plans  and \ndetailed cost estimates are yet to be prepared. To address the financial sustainability of the TPS, \nthe government is committed to support TPS debt servicing. \n\n \n\n                                                \n12 Ranging from 76 millimeters to 1,000 millimeters in diameter. \n13 The  TPS  is  expected  to  undertake  substantial  additional  capital  investment,  besides  the  current  ADB-assisted \nproject, to improve the WSS network, which will lead to a substantial increase in its depreciation and debt service \nobligations.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nGovernance  \n\nC. \n \n23. \nThe  TPS  was  constituted  as  a  state  unitary  enterprise  following  the  DCM  306  by \nmerging 18 existing towns and district vodokanals and other water utilities in Tashkent province. \nThe  TPS  was  established  and  registered  on  25  May  2016.  The  financial  management \nassessment  of  the  TPS  concluded  that  the  overall  financial  management  risk  rating  is \nsubstantial,  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  TPS  was  constituted  in  its  present  form  only  in \nDecember 2015 and is still consolidating its operations, (ii) the TPS has no prior experience in \nimplementing  a  large  project  supported  by  any  international  agency,  (iii)  the  TPS  will  be \nrecruiting  staff  who  may  have  no  or  limited  experience  of  ADB-financed  projects,  and  (iv)  a \nfinancial manual for the project operations is yet to be prepared. Given the substantial risks, the \nprincipal  mitigation  measure  proposed  is  that  the  UCSA,  with  its  prior  experience  in \nimplementing  large  capital  expenditure  projects  with  international  financial  support,  will \nsupervise and guide the TPS. Financial management consultants will be made available to the \nTPS to support its financial management activities, under the overall supervision of the UCSA.  \n\nThe  government  is  strongly  committed  to  institutional  strengthening  and  improving  the \n24. \nperformance of WSS management. Government resolutions propose to implement wide-ranging \nand  comprehensive  national  reforms  to  transform  the  subsector  and  substantially  improve \ngovernance.  Cumulatively,  these  actions  represent  a  major  step  and  provide  a  foundation  for \nsignificant  governance  reform.  They  provide  for  improved  accountability  in  WSS,  with  a \nreporting mechanism that reaches the highest levels of government. They also provide the tools \nneeded for utility benchmarking, including consumer databases, metering, automated billing and \ncollection, and improved management and financial management system functions.  \n \n25. \nProcurement management assessments have concluded that the UCSA satisfies ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  an  executing  agency.  Its  system  is  adequate  to  (i)  prepare  qualified  bidding \ndocuments;  and  (ii)  conduct  the  procurement  of  civil  works,  goods,  equipment,  and  consulting \nservices. The PCU will be staffed with experienced personnel that have received training in ADB \nproject administration and implementation. ADB will provide additional procurement oversight. \n \n26. \nwith \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \nD. \n \n27. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  improved  living  standards,  especially  in  rural  settlements. \nThe  provision  of  safe,  potable  water  will  significantly  reduce  the  expenditures  and  time \nresources  spent  by  households  and  businesses  to  cope  with  water  absence  and  shortages. \nImproving  the  institutional  and  management  capacity  of  the  TPS  will  enhance  the  provision  of \nreliable  water  supply  services,  support  fair  and  transparent  billing,  and  reduce  water  supply \nconflicts. Although 76.0% of households in the project area used piped water as a main source \nof potable water, only 23.6% of connected households were provided with piped water 24 hours \na  day,  7  days  a  week  during  the  week  prior  to  the  poverty  and  social  assessment  survey. \nFurther, it was found that almost 8% of households primarily use potentially unsafe water from \nopen sources for drinking and cooking needs. Only 36.0% of households have a bathroom with \npiped  water  supply.  The  project  investments  will  serve  264,500  people  (340,670  people  up  to \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nthe  government,  MOF,  UCSA,  and  TPS.

WSS constraints on households negatively affect the quality of life of all family members \nespecially  women,  who  are  primarily  responsible  for  water  delivery;  cooking;  cleaning;  and \ncaring for children, the sick, and the disabled. Project implementation will reduce unproductive \nlabor costs, saving a minimum of 3 working days for women in each household for each month, \nwhich is  bound to stimulate  women\u2019s  economic activities.  Key  features  of  the  project\u2019s gender \naction  plan15 include  (i)  assignment  of  a  social  development  and  gender  specialist  in  PCU;  (ii) \n(iii)  employment \nfacilitation  of  women\u2019s  participation \nopportunities  for  women  (including  at  least  30%  of  new  laboratory  staff  and  30%  of  customer \ncare workers); (iv) equitable women\u2019s pay in the project management and implementation team; \n(v) a total of 99 community hygiene promotion and sanitation awareness trainings (at least 30% \nof participants will be women); (vi) equal opportunity and/or access to training for female staff of \nthe  TPS  and  its  branches;  (vii)  establishment  of  a  gender-sensitive  customer  care  and/or \ncomplaints  unit;  and  (viii)  gender-sensitive  outreach  activities,  including  TV,  radio  spots,  and \nnewspaper articles. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming.  \n \nE. \n \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment \n29. \naccording  to  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Mitigation  measures  to  address  all \nconstruction  and  operational  impacts  have  been  included  in  the  environmental  management \nplan (EMP) prepared as part of the initial environmental examination. The initial environmental \nexamination  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on 19  August  2016. Impacts  from  the  project \nare  expected  to  be  short  term  and  limited.  Impacts  are  mostly  related  to  construction  and \nrehabilitation  of  the  trunk  main,  distribution  centers,  and  distribution  networks.  These  include \ndust, noise, vibration, hazardous solid wastes,16 labor and public safety, temporary blockage of \nhousehold  access,  traffic  disturbance,  and  production  and  transportation  of  construction \nmaterials. Environmental impacts during the operation phase include the increase of water use \nfrom  the  water  sources,  disposal  of  WTP  sludge,  accidental  leakage  from  chlorination,  noise \nfrom  the  WTP  and  pumping  stations,  and  increase  in  sewage  production  compared  to  the \ncapabilities of community facilities.   \n \n30. \nThe  PCU  within  the  UCSA  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation  in  order  to \ncomply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  requirements  and  national  environmental  regulations.  For  this, \nthe  PCU  will  be  required  to  designate  a  qualified, full-time  safeguards  specialist,  who  will  be \nassisted  by  the  PMC  environmental  specialists  in  overseeing  the  implementation  of  the  EMP. \nThe  cost  for  implementing  the  EMP  will  be  financed  by  the  project  as  follows:  (i)  the  cost  of \nmitigation measures and environmental monitoring will be included in the construction contracts, \nand  (ii)  the  cost  of  environmental  supervision  will  be  included  in  the  PMC  consulting  service \ncontract.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  handle  both  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nissues  will  be  established  after  project  effectivity.  The  PCU  will  submit  semiannual \nenvironmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  relevant  government  authorities,  and  these \nreports will be disclosed to the public on the UCSA (in Uzbek) and ADB (in English) websites. \n \n31. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement \naccording  to  requirements  set  out  in  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  A  land  acquisition  and \n                                                \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n16 Including asbestos-containing materials, scrap metals, and oils from old equipment. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n \n\nresettlement  plan (LARP)  has  been  prepared  that  contains a social  impact  assessment  based \non the preliminary project design. The LARP was disclosed on the ADB website on 18 August \n2016. It suggests that the project will permanently acquire a total of 13 land plots in 8 villages, \ncovering 22.3 hectares of land for a proposed new WTP and new water distribution centers. The \nlosses  include  arable  crop  cultivation  as  well  as  orchard  land  and  trees.  A  total  of  nine \nhouseholds (48 persons) will be affected, with two households expected to be severely affected \nby  economic  displacement.  There  will  be  no  physical  displacement.  In  addition,  there  will  be \ntemporary  impacts  on  assets  and/or  income  from  water  pipeline  laying.  The  cost  for \nimplementing the LARP is estimated at $1.2 million, which includes a 10% contingency.  \n\n32. \nThe LARP details the impacts and proposes mitigation of the identified impacts of land \nacquisition  as  well  as  temporary  impacts  that  include  an  entitlement  matrix  to  address  the \nimpacts.  Provisions  have  been  made  for  the  loss  of  land,  crops,  fruit  trees,  timber  trees, \ntemporary  job  loss  of  wage  earners,  allowances  for  severe  impacts,  and  temporary  impacts. \nOther relevant details include asset valuation, compensation provisions, organizational set-up, a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  and  compliance  with  ADB \ninformation  disclosure  and \nconsultation requirements.  The  UCSA  has  experience  of  implementing  ADB  projects  involving \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  Additional  capacity  enhancement  is  proposed  by  linking  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance for  Mainstreaming  Land  Acquisition  and Resettlement  Safeguards in the \nCentral and West Asia Region, in which Uzbekistan is a participant.17  \n\n33. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no \nindigenous peoples' communities in the project area or in the country in general, as defined in \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  operational  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  indigenous  peoples \nplanning documents are required. \n \nF. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The integrated benefits and impacts of the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nFinancial management capacity of the TPS is \nweak.  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe UCSA will supervise and guide the TPS in financial \nmanagement. TPS will (i) recruit accounting staff; (ii) recruit a \nproject management consultant team including a qualified \ninternational financial management specialist and a qualified \nnational financial management specialist to provide necessary \nsupport and to strengthen internal control of the TPS and PCU; \n(iii) develop a financial management training plan and train all \nproject financial staff before and during project implementation; \n(iv) prepare a financial management manual incorporating both \ngovernment and ADB requirements;   (v) upgrade its accounting \nsoftware 1C to allow access to all 18 branches; and (vi) ensure \nthat the terms of reference for the required external audits are \nagreed with ADB. \nThere will be close coordination with concerned government \nagencies to avoid delay in international contractor and/or \nsupplier registration.
