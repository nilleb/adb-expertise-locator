However,  the  ICICI \nBank,  one  of  the  strongest  and  highest-rated  banks  in  India,  has  an  experienced  group,  the \nTechnology  Finance  Group  (TFG),  that  (i)  has  pioneered,  developed,  and  supported  a  large \nrange  of  new  and  innovative  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  over  the  past \nthree decades; and (ii) collaborates with the ICICI Bank's corporate finance, project finance, and \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises divisions to boost its lending activities to renewable energy \nand  energy  efficiency  projects.  Given  its  strong  franchise,  thorough  understanding  of  the \ncorporate  credit  market,  and  extensive  experience  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nlending, the ICICI Bank is one of the most suitable candidates for intermediating funds for clean \nenergy development in India. \n \n3. \nADB is particularly keen to increase support for energy efficiency initiatives in India, and \nviews the potential cooperation with the ICICI Bank as an excellent opportunity to engage with a \nstrong  and  reputable  bank  that  has  the  reach,  capability,  and  interest  in  pursuing  energy \nefficiency  projects  alongside  the  ICICI  Bank\u2019s  current  efforts  in  renewable  energy.  The  ICICI \nBank has the appropriate experience (it has been active in clean energy investments for several \nyears)  and  a  pipeline  of  potential  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  to  be \nfinanced under the credit line. The credit line will be ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign loan that supports \nenergy efficiency enhancement in India. \n \nThe ICICI Bank will be required to use the credit line exclusively for funding projects in \n4. \npriority  sectors  recommended  by  ADB,  ensuring  close  alignment  of  focus  between  the  ICICI \nBank and ADB in promoting clean energy development in India. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe  Industrial  Credit  and  Investment  Corporation  of  India  was  formed  in  1955  at  the \ninitiative of the World Bank, the Government of India, and certain Indian industry representatives \nin order to create a development finance institution for providing medium- and long-term project \nfinancing  to  Indian  businesses.  Until  the  late  1980s,  the  ICICI  Bank  primarily  focused  its \nactivities on project finance, providing long-term funds to a variety of industry projects. With the \nliberalization of the finance sector in India in the 1990s, the ICICI Bank transformed its business \nfrom  a  development  finance  institution  focused  on  project  finance  to  a  diversified  financial \nservices provider offering a wide variety of products and services. \n \n6. \nThe ICICI Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a part of the ICICI group. Today, the ICICI \nBank  is  India\u2019s  second-largest  bank,  and  the  largest  private  sector  bank,  with  total  assets  of \nabout  $91 billion  as  of  March  2011.  The  ICICI  Bank  has  more  than  50,000  employees,  is \npresent in 18 countries, has a network of more than 2,000 branches, and offers a wide range of \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n\f2 \n\nfinancial  services  to  corporate  and  retail  customers,  including  investment  banking,  insurance, \nventure capital, and asset management. \n \n7. \nThe ICICI Bank\u2019s TFG, which will be the key administrator of the credit line, implements \nprograms for multilateral agencies in areas of collaborative research and development, energy, \nenvironment, and health care. The TFG\u2019s initiatives include (i) attracting and channeling private \nfinancing  into  cleaner  technologies,  (ii)  creating  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  to  mitigate \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions \nthrough  energy  efficiency,  and  (iii)  promoting  sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n \n8. \nThe  ICICI  Bank  has  a  pipeline  of  potential  projects  that  satisfy  the  requirements \nestablished  between  ADB  and  the  TFG  for  funding  under  the  credit  line.  The  TFG  will \nadminister, manage, and monitor the credit line in accordance with procedures to be set out in \nthe credit agreement to ensure the credit line is applied for its intended purpose. \n \nC. \n \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n1. \n\nOwnership \n\n \n9. \nAs  of  30  September  2011,  the  ICICI  Bank  was  majority  foreign-owned  through  its \nAmerican Depository Shares (26.25%), which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and \nthrough  foreign  institutional  investors  (38.17%).  The  remaining  equity  is  held  by  other \ninstitutional and non-institutional investors, including government-controlled entities.1 \n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\n \n10. \nAs a private sector entity, the ICICI Bank does not face the constraints on remunerating \nstaff faced by many of its government-owned peers. The ICICI Bank is, therefore, able to recruit \ncapable  and  talented  young  professionals  for  key  posts  within  its  management  structure.  The \nICICI  Bank  is  known  for  its  depth  of  leadership  talent,  which  is  deployed  across  the  bank's \noperations  for  providing  leadership  to  growing  businesses  and  diverse  career  opportunities  to \nmembers of management. The chief executive officer of the ICICI Bank is Chanda Kochhar, an \nexperienced  banker  with  over  25  years  experience  with  the  ICICI  Bank  and  who  has  headed \nmajor functions of the ICICI Bank at various times. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n \n11.  Within  the  Indian  banking  sector,  the  ICICI  Bank  is  recognized  as  an  early  adopter  of \nbest  practices  in  corporate  governance,  with  experience  dating  back  to  the  mid-1990s.  The \ncorporate governance framework of the ICICI Bank is based on (i) an independent board; (ii) the \nseparation  of  the  board\u2019s  supervisory  role  from  the  executive  management;  and  (iii)  the \nconstitution of board committees, generally comprising a majority of independent directors and \nchaired by an independent director, to oversee critical areas. \n \nThe ICICI Bank's board of directors consisted of 11 members as of 31 December 2011. \n12. \nOrganizational  documents  provide  for  a  minimum  of  three  directors  and  a  maximum  of  21 \ndirectors, not including the government-appointed director and the debenture director, if any is \nrequired.  The  Banking  Regulation  Act  1949  requires  that  at  least  51%  of  the  ICICI  Bank's \n\n                                                 \n1  A  breakdown  of  the  ownership  is  included  in  the  description  of  Ownership,  Management,  and  Governance \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f3 \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\ndirectors should have special knowledge or practical experience in banking and areas relevant \nto banking including accounting, finance, agriculture, and small-scale industry. The appointment \nof  the  chair  and  executive  directors  requires  the  approval  of  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  and \nshareholders.  The  Government  of  India  has  appointed  one  representative  to  the  board  of \ndirectors. \n \nD. \n \n13. \n \n14. \n \n15. \n \n16. \n \n17. \nStandard and Poor\u2019s.  \n  \n\nThe  ICICI  Bank  is  rated  Baa2  by  Moody\u2019s  and  BBB\u2013  (foreign  currency,  long-term)  by \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nADB  will  provide  a  United  States  (US)  dollar-denominated  credit  line  of  up  to  $100 \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nmillion to the ICICI Bank from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources.2  \n \nThe  credit  line  will  only  be  used  to  fund  projects  in  priority  sectors,3 identified  by  ADB \n19. \nbased on a comprehensive assessment of the clean energy sector and development strategy in \nIndia  and  drawing  on  various  resources  from  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment.  \n \nB. \n \n20. \ncriteria: \n\nProjects to be financed by the ADB credit line will need to satisfy the following eligibility \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  TFG  certifies  that  each  project  is  within  the  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency priority sectors, \neach  project  complies  with  all  applicable  national  laws  and  environmental \nrequirements, and \neach  project  complies  with  applicable  environmental  and  social  requirements \nprescribed in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for category FI. \n\n \n21. \nThe ICICI Bank will comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Where ADB provides funds to an intermediary institution to be onlent to borrowers \nfor  the  partial  financing  of  subprojects,  procurement  is  to  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with \n\n                                                 \n2  A  funding  application  has  been  made  to  the  Clean  Energy  Finance  Partnership  Facility  to  support  the  Technical \nAssistance  on  the  Development  of  Energy  Efficiency  Projects  in  India.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  is \nexpected to benefit not only the ICICI Bank but also other commercial banks as well as other partners from energy-\nintensive industries in India. \n\n3  The renewable energy and energy efficiency priority sectors to be funded by the credit line are listed in the Details \n\nof Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\festablished  private  sector  or  commercial  practices,  which  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  ICICI \nBank\u2019s  capability  in  assessing  and  monitoring  the  procurement  practices  of  its  borrowers  was \nconfirmed during due diligence. \n \n22. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n \nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nJustification for the credit line is based on the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIt will support the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency \npriority sectors in India. The credit line will be used exclusively to fund projects \nin  priority  sectors  identified  by  ADB;  as  a  result,  it  will  enable  ADB  to  influence \nand  direct  a  reputable  bank  with  relevant  experience  to  more  actively  pursue \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects in these sectors. The credit line \nwill  thereby  help  increase,  facilitate,  and  develop  investments  in  the  renewable \nenergy  and  energy  efficiency  sectors,  with  higher  impacts  on  environmentally \nsustainable growth and climate change mitigation. \n \nIt will catalyze local commercial bank financing to support the development \nof  smaller  and  medium  sized  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nprojects  in  India.  The  current  rate  of  penetration  of  local  commercial  bank \nfinancing  to  the  smaller  and  medium  size  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency  segment  in  India  remains  low.  By  channeling  funds  through  a  strong \nand  experienced  financial  intermediary,  the  proposed  credit  line  will  send  a \nstrong signal to the market and catalyze more local bank finance to support the \ndevelopment of this important segment. \n\nIt  will  fill  a  market  gap  in  terms  of  financing  for  renewable  energy  and \nenergy  efficiency  projects.  The  underdevelopment  of  the  Indian  financial \nmarkets,  the  impact of the global financial crisis, and the risk of persistent high \ninflation  and  the  resulting  policy  tightening  in  India  have  significantly  limited  the \nability  of  local  commercial  banks  to  provide  long-term  financing  for  renewable \nenergy  projects.  The  ADB  credit  line  will  help  fill  this  market  gap  by  providing \nlong-term  funding  with  a  flexible  draw-down  schedule  that  is  not  available  from \nother  commercial  lenders  in  the  market  and  cannot  be  secured  through  bond \nissuance. \n\n  \n\n(iii) \n\nRisks \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\nThis paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n\n4 \n\nC. \n \n23. \n \n\n \nC. \n \n24. \n \n25. \n \n26. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\n \nA. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n \n27. \nThe credit line will increase the availability of long-term financing for renewable energy \nand  energy  efficiency  projects  in  India.  Although  the  credit  line  will  constitute  only  part  of  the \nICICI  Bank\u2019s  required  funding  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  it  will  have  a \nsignificant  demonstration  impact  through  the  successful  implementation  of  renewable  energy \nand  energy  efficiency  projects  in  the  priority  sectors  identified  by  ADB.  This  will  lead  to  a \nreduction in the perceived risk associated with such projects, and will encourage the replication \nof similar projects. \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n \nThe credit line\u2019s expected outcome will be an increased number of projects developed in \n28. \nthe renewable energy and energy efficiency priority sectors in India, with support from the ICICI \nBank. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutput \n\n \n29. \nThe  credit  line\u2019s  output  will  be  an  expansion  of  the  ICICI  Bank\u2019s  lending  activities  to \nrenewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  and  initiatives  throughout  India  within  ADB \npriority sectors.4 \n \nB. \n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n \nStrategy 20205 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for environmentally sustainable development \n30. \nthat  would  expand  ADB\u2019s  promotion  of,  and  investment  in,  sound  environmental  management \nwhile  simultaneously  capitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  operational  strengths.  The  strategy  seeks  to  meet \nthe  region\u2019s  growing  energy  demand  by  helping  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to \ndevelop  environmentally  friendly  technologies,  specifically  addressing  energy  efficiency  and \nexpanding the use of clean energy sources. One of the key actions is to mitigate climate change \nby  moving  DMCs  on  to  low-carbon  growth  paths  by,  among  other  things,  improving  energy \nefficiency,  expanding  the  use  of  clean  energy  sources,  and  reducing  fugitive  greenhouse  gas \nemissions.  Furthermore,  under  Strategy  2020,  ADB  seeks  to  strengthen  its  support  to  the \nfinance sector at the regional and national levels by helping to develop financial infrastructure, \ninstitutions,  and  products  and  services.  The  credit  line  will  provide  systemic  support  for  the \nIndian  banking  sector  by  contributing  to  increased  lending  to  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency  projects,  which \nin  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment and directly in line with Strategy 2020. \n \n\nis  an  essential  component \n\n                                                 \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n5  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nADB\u2019s energy program in the Indian country partnership strategy approved in 20096 aims \n31. \nto enhance the impact of the government\u2019s initiatives for demand- and supply-related programs. \nThe  planned  activities  include  (i)  developing  renewable  and  alternative  energy  sources,  and \nclean generation technology; (ii) reducing technical and commercial losses in transmission and \ndistribution  networks  and  facilities;  (iii)  strengthening  interregional  transmission  capacity;  (iv) \nbringing  demand-side  management  and  energy  conservation  into  the  mainstream;  and  (v) \npromoting  private  sector  participation,  while  ensuring  environmental  sustainability  and \nsupporting institutional strengthening to implement the reforms required by the Electricity Act of \n2003.  The  credit  line  is  also  consistent  with  ADB's  latest  country  operations  business  plan  for \nIndia  2011\u20132013, 7  which  requires  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  be  further \nmainstreamed into ADB operations. \n \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n \n32. \nThe  credit  line  is  aligned  with  both  the  energy  and  finance  sector  strategies  of  ADB. \nUnder  its  Energy  Policy, 8 ADB\u2019s  investments  will  focus  on  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy projects, as well as the expansion of energy access. Starting in 2013, ADB will increase \nits target of clean energy investments to $2 billion a year from $1 billion, in a bid to accelerate \nlow-carbon  growth  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  the  region.  In  particular,  the \nEnergy Policy calls for ADB to expand its energy efficiency operations \u201cin the industry sector by \ncollaborating  with  industry  associations,  domestic  banks,  and  specialized  energy  efficiency \nagencies and energy service companies.\u201d As such, climate change finance has been elevated \nas  a  new  area  of  focus  in  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  since  2010.9 Supporting  finance \nsector  development  is  a  key  focus  of  development  assistance  for  ADB,  in  line  with  the  tenets \ndetailed  in  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy 10  and  enhanced  poverty  reduction \nstrategy,11 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by private sector investment, as a \nkey  contributing  factor  in  reducing  poverty.  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy  refers \nspecifically  to  ADB's  role  in  strengthening  the  finance  sector  in  DMCs.  The  credit  line  is \nconsistent with the overall sector strategies in that it will increase access to financial services for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency project developers and assist in the development of the \nfinance sector, thereby making private sector development more sustainable and ADB\u2019s mission \nof economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction more achievable. \n \n33. \nFurthermore,  the  credit  line  will  support  the  promotion  of  PPPs  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, a priority area of ADB\u2019s finance sector operations in India. In 2006, ADB approved \na $45 million equity investment in the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Ltd Private \nEquity  Fund  II. 12  In  2007  and  2009,  ADB  approved  two  multitranche  financing  facilities \namounting to $1.2 billion to support infrastructure development through PPPs. Both multitranche \nfinancing  facilities  were  channeled  through  a  financial  intermediary\u2014the  India  Infrastructure \nFinance  Company\u2014and  the  model  proved  effective.  The  recently  proposed  Catalyzing \nSustainable  Finance  Facility  will  also  be  a  financial  intermediation  loan  to  the  Housing  and \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2009.

Finally, energy efficiency interventions need not be \nbig and broad to start with; at times it is best to start with small, narrowly focused programs and \nto increase the scope and sophistication over time. \n \n36. \nClose  collaboration  between  the  public  and  private  sectors  is  required  to  tackle  the \ninfrastructure bottleneck in India. Previously, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and \nSouth  Asia  Regional  Department  have  jointly  supported  the  development  of  Bangalore  metro \nsystem to promote PPP in infrastructure development. The design of the credit line, especially \nfor  the  energy  efficiency  component,  has  also  benefited  from  collaboration  between  ADB\u2019s \npublic and private operations departments.      \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n37. \nThe  credit  line  is  classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  ICICI \nBank  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  activities  list,  and  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB  funds \ncomply  with  applicable  national  laws  and  regulations  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement and Social Protection Strategy.15 The ICICI Bank will establish an ESMS satisfactory \nto  ADB,  including  the  appointment  of  a  designated  staff  member  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the ESMS before the first disbursement, and maintain it throughout the tenor \nof  the  facility  to  manage  the  impacts  and  risks  of  existing  and/or  likely  future  portfolios.  An \nESMS framework has been prepared to provide guidance to develop and maintain an ESMS.16 \n \nB. \n \n38. \nThe ICICI Bank was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.
