THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Secondary Education Sector \nImprovement Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program will support the reforms of upper secondary education under the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka\u2019s General Education Sector Development Plan (GESDP), 2020\u20132025.1 \nIt aims to achieve (i) enhanced quality and relevance of upper secondary science, technology, \nmathematics, and commerce (STMC) programs; (ii) stronger provincial and school capacity to \nimplement education reforms; and (iii) better sector management capacity. The program builds \non the long-term engagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri Lanka\u2019s education \nsector and tackles key challenges stemming from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  Background. Sri Lanka recorded an average annual economic growth rate of 5.2% from \n2010 to 2019,2 reaching upper middle-income status in 2019. Growth has since been slowing \n(2.3% in 2019),3 partly because of the 2019 Easter bombings, which devastated the country\u2019s \nvital tourism industry, a main source of jobs, and discouraged foreign investment. The country \nwas reclassified as a lower middle-income country in June 2020.4 The impact of COVID-195 is \nexpected to contract real gross domestic product by 5.5% in 2020 and sharply increase poverty.6 \nSri Lanka aspires to be an advanced knowledge economy7 but needs to develop its human capital \nand transition to higher-value, more complex economic activities.8 Education and skilled labor are \nthus national priorities.  \n \n4.  Education sector context. The government aims to empower young people to reach \ntheir full potential, and infuse new technology to enhance production and productivity, as set out \nin the 2019 National Policy Framework (footnote 7). Enrollment in primary and lower secondary \neducation is high,9 but upper secondary education falls short on access, quality (especially in \nprovincial or rural schools), and relevance to the labor market.  \n \n \n1  In Sri Lanka, upper secondary education refers to grades 10\u201313, lower secondary refers to grades 6\u20139, and primary \nrefers to grades 1\u20135.

Atlas of Economic Complexity (accessed 30 August 2020). \n9  The net enrollment rate in 2018 was 99.1% in primary, 98.5% in lower secondary, and 81.4% in upper secondary \neducation. Gender parity was achieved in primary and lower secondary schools, but in upper secondary education, \n107 girls are enrolled for every 100 boys. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute \nfor Statistics (accessed 4 August 2020).  \n ", "2 \n5.  Labor market requirements. With an aging population, Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness will \ndepend  on  building  a  diversified  and  agile  workforce  able  to  adapt,  innovate,  and  apply \ntechnology.10 The country faces a shortage of skilled labor in industry and services, and a \nshortage of employable young people. Unemployment rates among youth (21.4%) and women \n(7.1%) are higher than the national average (4.4%).11 The labor market has three requirements \nthat the current education system does not meet. First, graduates with a foundation in science \nand technology are in high demand, followed by graduates in commerce and management,12 \nespecially for the service sector.13 Arts graduates are less in demand, accounting for 59% of \nunemployed graduates in 2018 (footnote 11). Second, the demand for highly skilled workers has \noutpaced demand for lower skill levels. Between 2015 and 2018, the number of workers employed \nin skilled jobs, such as managers and professionals, rose by 29%, while the number of those in \nlower skilled jobs increased by 3.9%.14 Third, industry, services, and trade require young people \nwith critical cognitive skills, digital and English skills, and 21st century skills, such as problem \nsolving, creative thinking, teamwork, and communication (footnote 10 and Appendix 3).15  \n \n6.  Limited access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. \nDespite high access rates overall, upper secondary enrollments remain skewed toward arts \nsubjects. Only a third of upper secondary students were enrolled in science and technology \nstreams in 2018.16 Nationwide, only 36% of schools with General Certificate of Education \nAdvanced Level (\u2018A\u2019 Level) streams offer science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n(STEM).17  \n \n7.  Quality issues. Secondary education learning outcomes are poor, as measured by \nnational and international tests.18 In 2019, 26% of students did not pass the grade 11 General \nCertificate of Education Ordinary Level (\u2018O\u2019 Level) examination, while 38% of school candidates \ndid not pass the \u2018A\u2019 Level exams. The failure rate in \u2018A\u2019 Level mathematics was 63%.19   \n \n \n10 International Labour Organization. 2019.

The COVID-19 outbreak20 disrupted education for more than 5.57 \nmillion learners (including 2.73 million at secondary level) when schools and universities had to \nclose.21 In response, the government is implementing the Contingency Emergency Response \nPlan (CERP) for general education,22 using e-learning platforms and/or classes through television. \nHowever, children and teachers in rural areas lack internet connectivity, access to devices and \ndigital  platforms,  and  the  training  required  for  distance  education.23 Thus,  the  COVID-19 \npandemic has exacerbated rural\u2013urban inequity, while causing learning losses that could lead to \nmore dropouts.24 If unchecked, learning losses and poor education quality could lead to high and \nsustained costs. Sri Lanka cannot afford to ignore these issues.25 As a result, the government \nrequested ADB to reprioritize its assistance program in 2020 to support the government\u2019s \nresponse to the impacts of COVID-19, focusing on continuity in education, among others. The \nproposed program is part of a package of ADB support to mitigate COVID-19 impacts in Sri \nLanka.26  \n \n9.  Gender issues. Sri Lanka has achieved gender parity in secondary education, with more \ngirls in the education system performing better than boys, and overall higher participation and \npass rates. At \u2018A\u2019 Level, boys are outnumbered by girls, and in the examinations, girls outperform \nboys by 20 percentage points (footnote 19). The key issue in education is the limited participation \nof girls in market-relevant subjects and streams. Female enrollment for \u2018A\u2019 Level streams is twice \nas high as that of males in the arts stream, but only 6% of girls enrolled are in the technology \nstream,  compared  with  18%  of  boys. 27 This  tendency  contributes  to  lowering  the  future \nemployability potential of females: among those with upper secondary education or higher, the \nunemployment rate is 13.2% among females and 5.1% among males (footnote 11).  \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n10.  Previous reforms and lessons learned. In 2013, the government laid the foundation for \nmodernizing secondary education by (i) introducing the technology stream; (ii) investing in \nappropriate facilities for STEM education; and (iii) supporting leadership training for principals and \ndeputy principals. The transformative reform trajectory was supported by ADB\u2019s Education Sector \nDevelopment Program, an earlier results-based lending (RBL) program.28 The lessons from it \n \n20 The government has so far contained the outbreak, with 4,252 confirmed cases (cumulative) and 13 deaths as of 7 \nOctober 2020.

It is also \nvital to (i) strengthen upper secondary education (grades 10\u201313), so that students can pursue \nmultiple pathways; (ii) continue strengthening educational leadership at schools and provincial \nauthorities,  but  with  emphasis  on  effective  local  action  (e.g.,  school  grants  and  school \ndevelopment plans); and (iii) continue performance-based partnership agreements between the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) and provincial authorities, with emphasis on mutual accountability \nand alignment between reforms and local needs. In addition, ADB\u2019s independent evaluation of \nthe RBL modality29 highlighted the need for stronger monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems \nto better track sector performance, while COVID-19 underscored the need to build resilience into \nthe education system, such as multimodal approaches to education delivery, remedial learning, \nand remote teacher training. \n \n11.  Government program. Building on the above reforms, the government\u2019s GESDP 2020\u2013\n2025 (para. 2) has four thrusts: (i) quality of education improved, especially in science, technology, \nand mathematics; (ii) equity in education strengthened; (iii) stewardship and service delivery of \ngeneral education strengthened; and (iv) evidence-based education policymaking and planning \nenhanced. The government requested ADB support for the GESDP in relation to upper secondary \neducation, to continue reforms and help manage the following priority issues:  \n(i)  To meet workforce requirements (para. 5), the education system needs to produce \nyoung people able to learn new skills and technologies, with a sound foundation in \nmarket-relevant subjects and 21st century skills. The current education system \nemphasizes routine cognitive skills, with content-heavy curricula, and lacks an \ninquiry-based approach30 with practical applications. The assessment system \nemphasizes  information  recall,  rather  than  analysis  and  problem  solving. 31 \nInadequate quality of teaching contributes to poor learning outcomes (para. 7).32 \nThus, curricula, assessment system, and pedagogy all need substantial reform.  \n(ii)  Despite previous efforts (para. 10), STEM access is limited because qualified \nSTEM teachers are scarce and are not deployed evenly to urban and rural schools. \nMany teachers teach subjects for which they are not qualified. \n(iii)  STEM access for girls and the underperformance of boys require attention (para. \n9). \n(iv)  COVID-19 (para. 8) highlights inequalities in access to digital education and \nblended learning,33 and the need to build system resilience by (a) integrating \nonline and distance learning approaches and resources; (b) building teacher \ncapacity in digital skills and virtual teaching; and (c) supporting remedial lessons \nfor students left behind.  \n \n12.  Education sector management. Strengthening the management capacity of principals \nand provincial education authorities (PEAs) still requires translation into local actions and budgets \n(para. 10). Despite a redistribution of funding to poorer provinces, public spending on education \n \n29 ADB. 2017. Results-Based Lending at the ADB: An Early Assessment.

Inquiry-based curricula and approach are defined in the verification protocols (Table A3.2., DLI 2). \n31 Classroom assessments integrated into daily teaching are required for student learning and teacher guidance.  \n32 Teachers are not sufficiently trained in inquiry-based teaching\u2013learning practices. \n33 Blended learning refers to a combination of online learning, educational television and radio programs, remote \nlearning, and classroom-based face-to-face approaches. ", "5 \nremains skewed to urban schools.34 Fragmented M&E systems affect sector planning and \nmonitoring. Budgeting and procurement processes and social and environmental safeguard \ncapacities (paras. 33\u201336) could be strengthened. \n \n13.  Timing. The proposed program is aligned with the government\u2019s GESDP and CERP (para. \n8), which cannot afford delays. Curricula and pedagogy reforms have already begun earlier in \n2020, and new \u2018O\u2019 Level exams are scheduled for 2024. CERP\u2019s COVID-19 mitigation measures \nare integrated into the program, which is scheduled to begin in late 2020. \n \n14.  Results-based lending. The RBL modality is appropriate because the program (i) is part \nof a strong education sector plan (footnote 1) with expenditure framework; (ii) builds on the \nprevious RBL program\u2019s achievements and experience; (iii) strengthens national and subnational \nsystems in delivering reforms; (iv) focuses on results, not on transactions and expenditures; and \n(v) makes development coordination more effective since development partners are working \nwithin a common results framework. ADB financing represents 12.5% of the government\u2019s upper \nsecondary education agenda under the GESDP, so the program is designed to leverage large-\nscale and unprecedented reforms. The executing agency and other stakeholders have experience \nwith the RBL approach. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 203035 and the country \npartnership strategy, 2018\u20132022, and is included in its country operations business plan, 2020\u2013\n2022.36  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB adds value by (i) bringing cutting-edge expertise in innovative \nand  inquiry-based  blended  teaching\u2013learning  approaches,  in  partnership  with  reputed \ninternational institutes sharing best practices; (ii) creating synergy across secondary education, \ntechnical and vocational education and training, and higher education, with ADB\u2019s support in all \nthree subsectors;37 (iii) enabling the implementation of better teacher deployment strategies; (iv) \nempowering schools and communities to implement local actions that support the reforms; (v) \nmitigating the impact of COVID-19 in education; and (vi) accelerating the reforms by strengthening \nsector  management.  The  program\u2019s  focus  on  upper  secondary  education  (grades  10\u201313) \ncomplements the World Bank\u2019s support to primary and lower secondary education (grades 1\u2013\n9).38 Table 1 shows the key development partners.39  \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n16.  The proposed program is aligned with the government\u2019s GESDP 2020\u20132025 and focuses \non upper secondary education (Table 1).  \n \n34 Provincial schools, run by PEAs, account for 95% of schools and 65% of total general education expenditure. National \nschools, mostly in urban areas and run by MOE, account for 5% of schools and 35% of expenditure. \n35 The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and three of its operational priorities: (1) addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities; (2) accelerating progress in gender equality; and (6) strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity.

Program Results \n \n17.  The RBL program\u2019s impact will be: human resource development enhanced, supporting \nhealthy and productive citizens and a globally competitive knowledge-centered economy.40 The \noutcome will be: secondary education system transformed and aligned with evolving labor force \nneeds, as captured by a disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) at outcome level (DLI 1) and two \nindicators not linked to disbursement.41 In addition to systemwide reforms, the program will focus \non 750 schools, of which 80% are provincial schools. By 2026, reforms supported by the program \nwill benefit about 953,000 students (503,000 females and 450,000 males) annually. The program \nwill also have equipped 47,853 teachers (31,583 women and 16,270 men) with skills that will \nbenefit successive generations of students. \n \n18.  Output 1: Quality and relevance of secondary science, technology, mathematics, \nand  commerce  programs  enhanced.  The  ADB  program  will  foster  integrated  reforms  to \ncurricula, pedagogy, and assessments. It will support a national student assessment framework \nand the rollout of the new assessment system. The program will also support curricula reform, by \nintegrating practical problem solving with cognitive and socio-emotional skills (DLI 2), using \nblended  learning  approaches  (footnote  33).  Teachers  will  be  trained  in  inquiry-based  and \ninteractive pedagogy (DLI 3), including via blended approaches and innovative modalities such \nas Applied Resource Hubs (centers for practical and blended teacher training), teacher clusters \nas learning communities, and online and offline training.

The campaign will also educate children and \ncommunities on disease risk and prevention, disaster resilience, and preparedness.  \n \n19.  Output  2:  Provincial  and  school  capacity  to  implement  education  reforms \nstrengthened. The program aims to reduce disparities between urban and provincial schools and \nempower local authorities to translate reforms into local actions. It will promote the implementation \nof government policy on equitable distribution of teachers (DLI 4), including monetary and non-\nmonetary incentives. It will also strengthen the capacity of principals and PEAs to support \nimproved practices, approaches, and technologies. PEAs will develop a blended learning plan to \ntailor modes of delivery based on students\u2019 specific needs and circumstances, including short-, \nmedium-, and long-term measures to strengthen online and remote learning.42 A budget line will \nbe created to implement school development plans that will help schools meet local needs to \nimprove learning, attract more students (especially girls) to take up STMC subjects, and reduce \ndropouts  among  boys  (DLI  5).  The  program  will  also  support  annual  performance-based \npartnership  agreements  between  PEAs  and  MOE  (para.  10),  including  adequate  resource \nallocation, especially for poorer schools (DLI 6). \n \n20.  Output 3: Sector management capacity strengthened. The program will enhance the \nreliability and use of data, strengthen M&E systems, and MOE's capacity for research, evidence-\nbased planning, and management (DLI 7). It will also (i) improve MOE and PEAs\u2019 fiduciary \nmanagement and compliance with the government\u2019s financial and procurement regulations; (ii) \nstrengthen MOE and PEAs\u2019 capacity for social and environmental safeguards; and (iii) ensure \nthat all activities (under the proposed program) are gender-mainstreamed, and data and results \ndisaggregated by sex.43 An indicator not linked to disbursement focuses on the introduction and \nyearly application of program-based budgeting compliant with sector targets by MOE. \n \n21.

The program will exclude the procurement of \nhigh-value contracts.51 \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n28.  Program soundness and results assessment. The program soundness assessment52 \nindicates that the RBL program, while ambitious, is comprehensive and tackles problems related \nto poor education quality and relevance, and limited access to subjects with high employment \npotential. Public interventions are justified: 90% of all schools are public schools, and 95% of all \nSri Lankan students attend public schools. The results assessment shows that the RBL program \nand results framework are well-designed, the DLIs are critical for achieving results, and the \nprogram interventions are expected to improve sector performance and outcome. \n \n29.  Economic analysis. The program is expected to improve the employment opportunities \nand incomes of young people in two ways: by (i) equipping students with higher competencies \nand market-relevant skills to qualify them for higher-paying jobs; and (ii) increasing their readiness \nfor higher education in STMC fields, which offer greater employment potential and higher income. \nThe program also contributes to addressing learning losses caused by COVID-19. By improving \ninternal efficiency in the education system, the program contributes to resource savings. In \naddition to incurring positive private returns, the economic rationale for the program is justified by \n(i) high macroeconomic returns to investment in educational attainment and quality, as suggested \nby global evidence;53 (ii) reductions in poverty and inequality (para. 30); (iii) the wider social \nbenefits incurred; and (iv) in the long term, improved competitiveness and economic growth. The \neconomic value of investing in education quality is even greater in the context of changing \ndemands for skills because of the fourth industrial revolution and Sri Lanka\u2019s aging population. \nYouth need to be equipped with the skills that are likely to yield better labor market outcomes and \naccelerate growth. While there are trade-offs to investing in education quality, the short-term \nopportunity costs are likely to be outweighed by the expected gains and the contribution to \n \n50 A transaction technical assistance grant is currently being processed to support capacity development on curriculum, \npedagogy, and assessment reforms.

Since  the  RBL  program  is  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s upper secondary education sector program, quantitative attribution of benefits \nsolely to the RBL program would be difficult, so no cost\u2013benefit analysis or calculation of an \neconomic internal rate of return was done. \n \n30.  Poverty and inequality reduction. The program\u2019s emphasis on better access to and \nquality of secondary education, with its targeted support for underperforming provincial schools, \nwill enable poor, rural students to gain a relevant education in school. This will provide them with \nbetter post-secondary options for further education, skills development, and livelihoods.   \n \n31.  Gender impact.  The  program  is  classified  as  effective  gender mainstreaming.  The \nprogram aims to increase girls\u2019 participation in STEM education and widen the horizon for women. \nIt includes strategies to encourage girls\u2019 take-up of STEM via media campaigns and school-based \nactions outlined in the school development plans; such actionable steps in school development \nplans are a key criterion for securing school grants (DLI 5). The program also includes career \ncounseling by female role models to familiarize girls with the range of options available in STEM \n(program action plan). It supports training of teachers, provincial education officers, and M&E staff \nwith gender targets set at 60%, and training of principals and deputy principals with gender targets \nset at 40% (design and monitoring framework). Gender is mainstreamed into all activities relating \nto curricula, instructional guides, needs analyses, and capacity development. All management \nand monitoring systems will report sex-disaggregated data. The program tackles the issue of \naccess to STEM within an education reform program comprehensively, with activities that aim to \nchange gender-biased stereotypes and create an enabling environment for girls and women in \nthe education system. In addition, the program addresses higher drop-out and under-performance \namong boys. It includes an assessment of factors behind drop-out and low performance of boys, \nwhich will be used to develop school-level actions to improve performance outlined in the school \ndevelopment plans. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n32.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The M&E system assessment (footnote 47) found \ninadequate integration of M&E systems. The program's design incorporates these findings and \ncovers the need for stronger capacities, better analysis, and a transparent consolidated national \neducation management information system (DLI 7, para. 20).  \n \n33.  Fiduciary systems. Education is a priority for the government, as shown by the strong \ntrack record of public spending in this sector since 2010. Education expenditure steadily increased, \nregardless of the fiscal situation and deficit; and as a percentage of public spending, it consistently \nremained above 10% since 2014. The program expenditure framework assessment evaluated \npast budget against actual expenditure incurred and noted that, although expenditure is constant, \nthe government budget is usually overestimated. Likewise, because of weak budgetary practices, \nthe fiduciary systems assessment concluded that the overall pre-mitigation financial management \nrisk is substantial.54 The risk includes (i) uncertainty in budget allocation; (ii) suboptimal budget \nestimation practices; (iii) inconsistent use of provincial budget codes by the provinces; and (iv) \nchallenges related to compliance with the government\u2019s financial regulations, resulting in recurring \naudit observations. To mitigate the risk and strengthen the systems, ADB will support the \nimplementation of program-based budgeting and provide hands-on support to MOE and the \nprovinces to develop robust processes and procedures, budget codes, and an efficient reporting \nand monitoring system for the program.  \n \n54 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \n34.  Procurement.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  functional  public  procurement  system,  based  on \ncomprehensive National Procurement Guidelines issued in 2006, which are supplemented by \ndetailed manuals for the procurement of goods and works, and the recruitment of consultants. An \nassessment of the procurement system was conducted, and benefited from the findings of earlier \nassessments of country and sector procurement systems, as well as a review of procurement in \nthe previous RBL program and other education programs.55 While MOE has reasonable capacity \nfor procurement, the assessment indicates that adherence to the standard procedures laid down \nin the 2006 National Procurement Guidelines could be improved. A procurement and contract \nmanagement workshop will be conducted for MOE staff to mitigate the procurement risks. \n \n35.  Anticorruption  measures.  The  government  has  been  strengthening  anticorruption \nmeasures, including the enforcement of existing anticorruption laws, the creation of special courts \nto deal specifically with corruption, and a 5-year Anti-Corruption Action Plan with the target of \nmaking Sri Lanka a corruption-free nation by 2023. The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, \nCorruption, and Other Prohibited Activities in RBL programs were explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOE.56 \n \n36.  Safeguards. The safeguard categories are C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples, since no involuntary resettlement impact and no impact on indigenous peoples are \nanticipated from minor renovations of existing educational facilities.57 While no significant or \nirreversible adverse environmental impacts are expected, the exact specifications are yet to be \nfinalized, so the program was categorized B for environment as a precautionary measure. 58 The \nsafeguard  systems  assessment  (footnote  57)  found  gaps  such  as  the  limited  scope  of \nenvironmental assessments and weak capacity to implement safeguards. An environmental and \nsocial  management  framework  was  prepared  combining  national  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements to guide screening, categorization, assessment, \nmonitoring, and reporting. Any activity categorized A for environment, or A or B for involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples, will be excluded from the program. The program is committed \nto the implementation of an action plan to bridge the gaps.59 \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.

Science and technology laboratories have been provided to provincial schools under the \n1,000 Schools Program, but these remain under-utilized as the curricula and corresponding pedagogy have been focused on rote learning with limited practical \napplication. There are also mathematics and ICT laboratories in these schools. These laboratories will be used as innovation laboratories in the SESIP supported \nprogram schools for hands-on learning in STMC subjects and will need to comply with the minimum standards for the conduct of practical science, technology, \nmathematics, and IT/commerce activities aligned with the new curricula, developed by NIE. The new curriculum will incorporate blended learning approaches as \nwell as communicable diseases awareness and prevention, as and where appropriate. Blended learning approaches refer to a combination of online learning, \neducational television/radio programs, remote learning, and classroom-based face-to-face approaches. \nd  SESIP will target the following \u2018A\u2019 Level stream/ subjects: science (physics, chemistry, and biology); combined mathematics; technology (engineering technology, \nbio-systems technology, and science for technology); commerce (business studies, accounting, economics, and ICT). This is a total of 11 subjects and these will \nhereafter be referred to as program \u2018A\u2019 Level subjects. There are Tamil, Sinhalese, and bi-lingual schools in the current education system. All materials including \ntextbooks will be developed and  translated in both Sinhalese and Tamil languages and teacher training will also include both languages. \ne  Media campaign includes the use of various media (mass media, e-platforms, and/or interpersonal communication) as appropriate for the target audience in both \nurban and rural settings, with information on the education reforms\u2014on the new curriculum, new inquiry-based teaching practices and assessment systems\u2014and \nin particular on its benefits for developing students with adaptive and interdisciplinary, 21st century skills required for the modern global economy and in line with \nfuture labor market needs. The media campaign will use various formats for the different groups of stakeholders in order to reach them. These may include \neditorials in newspapers, radio/TV talk shows, radio/TV spots or commercials, e-materials for internet/MOE website, interpersonal communication, as appropriate, \non the nature of the education reforms and the need for these reforms, future of education in Sri Lanka, materials to allay concerns of parents and general public \non the education reforms, deployment of teachers in provincial schools and dissemination of the fact that all teachers will be trained on new curriculum and \nencourage parents to send children to provincial 1AB schools; and that additional support will be provided to provincial 1AB schools to build their capacity, and \nencouraging girls to take up STMC subjects, etc.1AB schools are schools providing the four upper secondary streams. \nf  The teacher training facilities are dispersed throughout the country covering all provinces. There is also one teacher training laboratory at NIE at the national level. \nThese and other facilities, as identified, will be potentially converted to Applied Resource Hubs which will be used for the conduct of practical science, mathematics, \ntechnology, and IT/commerce activities for teacher training. Criteria for Applied Resource Hubs would be that at least one such Hub is located in every district and \nwithin easy distance of the project-supported schools making it convenient for teachers to attend the training. NIE will develop the criteria/minimum standards for \nApplied Resource Hubs for teacher training in new pedagogy. A survey of these teacher training facilities plus NIE hub will be conducted to identify staff and \nequipment needs against the NIE criteria/minimum standards for Applied Resource Hubs. A pool of trainers for each subject in both languages where applicable, \nwill need to be identified at national and provincial levels to act as resource trainers for Applied Resource Hubs. \ng  SESIP will target around 750 1AB schools of which 80% or 600 will be provincial 1AB schools\u2014hereafter these will be referred to as program-targeted schools. \nThese provincial schools have the potential of offering the 4 streams\u2014science, technology, mathematics, and commerce streams\u2014but are hampered by a range \nof key challenges including, lack of teachers, lack of effective pedagogy, lack of use of the science labs, etc. Criteria for selection of provincial schools: (i) location \nof school in province, rural/ remote and/or marginalized area; (ii) location of school vis-\u00e0-vis feeder schools; and (iii) location of schools vis-\u00e0-vis proximity to \nnational schools or to fully pledged provincial schools in high demand.   \nh  Deployment means recruitment, placement, and redeployment. \ni  Performance-based partnership agreements will (i) review achievements and challenges faced by provinces; (ii) outline targets, related strategies, budgets and \naccountabilities for improving learning outcomes, attracting and increasing students, especially girls into STMC; (iii) improving pedagogy; (iv) adopt cross \nlearning/sharing opportunities; and (v) implement performance-based allocation to provide support to lagging schools to improve their performance against key \nreform indicators, as outlined in SDPs.  \nj  The integrated M&E framework approval will include the following aspects: document drafted, reviewed, and validated by the standing committee. M&E framework \nwill include the list of key indicators from the different institutions to be tracked in NEMIS. The policy will also lay out the technical issues with regard to online \ndatabase, procedures for capturing and processing data, with suggestions for enhancing the present arrangement. \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \n \nk  The present monitoring formats used at MOE, provincial, and zonal levels will be standardized to ensure the data reported are consistent and uniform across all \nlevels. This would enable the monitoring of programs and projects effectively. For the new/revised formats developed, user guides will be produced to provide \nguidelines on filling the formats (paper/online). Guides will also provide clear definitions and explanation of various reporting items. Data quality standards will be \ndeveloped based on data quality assessment in consultation with DCS. \nl  Annual education sector performance reports can include data analysis on equitable access and participation in the primary and secondary education; trends in \nstudent performance and learning outcomes, progress made in empowerment of professional staff, education expenditure analysis, and progress towards national \ngoals and SDG 4 targets. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Ministry of Education.   \n ", "    Appendix 3  27 \n \nTable A3.2: Disbursement-Linked Indicator Verification Protocols \nDisbursement \nInformation  Verification  formula \n  Source and  Agency, and  (refer to Table 6 of \nDisbursement-Linked Indicators  Definition and Description of Achievement  Frequency  Procedure   the PID for amounts) \nDLI 1: A student assessment system for improving learning and 21st century skills established by 2025.  \n2019 baseline:   Program schools are selected by MOE to satisfy the       \nNo assessments yet based on new  following criteria: \ncurriculum.
