The  program  promotes  higher  and \nbetter-quality investment through sequenced reforms that (i) provide a more predictable and open \nbusiness  environment,  (ii)  improve  the  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \ninfrastructure market, and (iii) make the public procurement system more efficient and transparent. \nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  Subprogram  3  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan (2018\u20132020) for Indonesia as a deliverable in 2018.1 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProgrammatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  use  of  a  programmatic  approach \nwith  a  policy-based  loan  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  aligns  ADB\u2019s  support  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform program. It also provides incentives and capacity to complete the reforms \nwith the flexibility to add new priority reforms in subsequent subprograms. In September 2014, \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach for subprogram 1 of the Stepping \nUp  Investments  for  Growth  Acceleration  Program,  with  the  loan  amounting  $400  million. \nSubprogram 1 comprised 21 policy actions which established a structured, long-term engagement \nto improve the investment climate, focusing on reducing foreign equity restrictions and introducing \nelectronic procurement. 2 Subprogram 2 was approved in July 2016 with a loan of $500 million, \ncomprising 18 policy actions. It focused on streamlining business licensing regulations, providing \na foundation for public-private partnerships (PPP), and implementing public procurement reforms \nfor  faster  and  higher-quality  infrastructure  delivery.3 At  this  time,  the  Board  also  approved  the \ngovernment\u2019s request for the addition of a third subprogram to maintain momentum on investment \nclimate reforms. Subprogram 3 now focuses on consolidating reforms to stimulate and facilitate \nefficient public and private investment, and to support the successful implementation of earlier \nreforms.  The  inclusion  of  a  post-program  partnership  framework,  2018\u20132022  continues  ADB\u2019s \nengagement utilizing TA and policy dialogue. \n \nThe  development  problem.  Indonesia  faces  interrelated  challenges  of  increasing  its \n4. \neconomic growth, alleviating poverty, and reducing income inequalities. From a peak of 6.4% in \n2010,  growth  slowed  to  an  average  of  5.0%  from  2014\u20132017.  Accelerating  global  demand \nsuggests modest improvements in growth to 5.3% in 2018. 4 However, current projections remain \nsignificantly below the bottom of the government\u2019s target range of 7.0%\u20139.0% as stated in the \nNational  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2015\u20132019. 5  Moreover,  since  2000, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Jakarta. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nIndonesia has experienced one of the largest increases in inequality in Southeast Asia. The Gini \nindex increased from 0.30 in 2000 to 0.40 in 2015, falling slightly to 0.39 in 2017.6 Disparities have \na regional dimension. In 2016, per capita income in Jakarta was approximately $15,656, 13 times \nhigher than the average of $1,195 in East Nusa Tenggara province.7 Access to public services \nand infrastructure levels show similar disparities.8  Inequality is driven by many factors, including \nthe  following:  job  creation  is  not  sufficient  to  reduce  Indonesia\u2019s  11  million  youth  not  in \nemployment, education, or training; access to public services (e.g., health and education) is not \nequal for all; and low-income families have poor resilience to external shocks. \n \n5. \nInvestment constraints have contributed to low growth. A medium-term perspective \nreveals  a  5-year  average  investment  growth  rate  of  just  4.7%  since  2013. 9  Until  recently, \nIndonesia performed poorly in global surveys of doing business and competitiveness. The World \nBank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report ranked Indonesia 114th out of 189 countries.10 This compared \nunfavorably with many regional peers such as Malaysia (18th), the Philippines (95th), Thailand \n(26th),  and  Viet  Nam  (78th).  A  cumbersome  business  licensing  regime  has  contributed  to  this \nhigh-cost  business  environment,  which  disproportionately  affects  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs).  In  addition,  investment  remains  relatively  inefficient  and  expensive \nconsidering  that  every  $7  spent  on  investment  produces  only  $1  of  income,  compared  with  a  \n$5 investment for $1 of income in neighboring countries.11 This reflects inefficiencies in capital \nbudget execution and slow procurement. Finally, from 2008 to 2012, as a share of gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP),  public  infrastructure  spending  averaged  only  1.5%  and  private  infrastructure \ninvestment 0.6% compared with an average of 3.6% for both public and private across Asia.12 \nConsequently,  Indonesia\u2019s  stock  of  infrastructure  in  per  capita  terms  is  just  one-third  of  the \naverage  for  emerging  markets,  or  one-eighth  of  the  average  for  advanced  economies.13 The \ncountry\u2019s annual infrastructure investment needs are estimated at approximately 7% of GDP.14 \n \n6. \nThe government has begun to address investment constraints. Beginning in 2015, \nthe government gradually introduced a series of 16 economic policy packages covering a range \nof  reforms,  including  simplified  business  and  trade  regulations,  improved  trade  logistics,  and \nreduced  barriers  to  investment.  These  packages  have  also  been  particularly  effective  in \naddressing fragmentation of responsibilities and poor coordination across government agencies \nby  unifying  efforts  under  a  shared  set  of  results,  answerable  to  the  Office  of  the  President  of \nIndonesia. The government is working to facilitate PPPs in infrastructure and has made significant \nimprovements in public procurement, with 90% of the 2017 budget spending and almost 70% of \nthe  2017  infrastructure  budget  delivered  by  November  2017.  These  reforms  contributed  to \nIndonesia\u2019s  sovereign credit  being  elevated  to an  investment-grade rating  by  both Standard & \nPoor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings in 2017. Compared to 2015, Indonesia jumped 42 places to be ranked \n72nd out of 190 countries in the World Bank\u2019s 2018 Doing Business report (para. 5).15 The reforms \nare also beginning to show up in improved investment data. Growth in investment picked up to \n\n                                                \n6  The Gini index ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). A Gini index above 0.36 is comparatively \n\nhigh by international standards. \n\n7  Government of Indonesia, Statistics Indonesia. 2017. Statistics Indonesia Yearbook.

While subprograms 1 and 2 achieved significant progress, several \nadditional challenges must be addressed to accelerate investment, boost growth, and promote \ninclusion. These include (i) further streamlining the high-cost business environment, which deters \nprivate investment, especially for SMEs, (ii) improving access and opportunities for citizens by \nleveraging private sector participation in infrastructure investment, and (iii) accelerating delivery \nof public investments by resolving inefficiencies in the public procurement system. \n \n8. \nDespite recent improvements, the regulatory environment still imposes high costs \non businesses. Costs stem from a proliferation of regulations at national and subnational levels \nas well as complex, inefficient licensing practices. The combined average number of regulations \nissued by national and subnational governments increased from 453 per year during 1999\u20132003 \nto  1,789  per  year  during  2010\u20132014.  Starting  a  business  in  Indonesia  requires  an  investor  to \nobtain 11  approvals,  and the total  process takes  22  days,  compared  with 5  approvals  and  4.5 \ndays in Thailand. Outside of Jakarta, this increases to 12 approvals and 27 days.18 Regulations \nin Indonesia are often ad hoc and are not considered under a systematic framework that identifies \nbenefits and costs. Tax administration, particularly at the subnational level, is cumbersome and \nimposes costs that disproportionally affect SMEs and constrains inclusive growth. \n \n9. \nAn underdeveloped  framework for  private  participation in  infrastructure  hampers \nIndonesia\u2019s ability to meet investment needs. Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure gap constrains access \nto  key  public  services  like  health  and  education,  and  limits  opportunities  for  growth  and \ndevelopment for citizens with the greatest need. An uncertain regulatory framework for PPPs and \nthe  absence  of  long-term  financing  for  investment  have  limited  private  sector  interest  in \ninfrastructure. Until 2017, the government did not have a dedicated unit or project development \nfacility to help prepare and test project proposals or provide transaction advisory services. A lack \nof capacity on risk management and pricing has further biased line agencies away from PPPs. \n \n10. \nPublic procurement systems are not optimized to promote efficient investment and \nproject  execution.  Inconsistent  application  of  procurement  guidelines  and  outdated  systems \ncreate  delays  in  project  execution.  For  example,  up  to  2017,  almost  40%  of  procurement  was \nbunched  in  the  financial  year\u2019s  fourth  quarter. 19  The  absence  of  a  strong  monitoring  and \nevaluation function in the National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP) limits the provision of key \nprocurement performance metrics to different levels of management. Central agencies have little \ndata  on  which  to  gauge  performance  of  key  line  agencies,  and  few  tools  to  promote  more \nconsistent and timely application of procurement processes. Local governments are constrained \nby  the  lack  of  efficient  procurement  tools  and  electronic  systems.  These  constraints  result  in \ndelays  in  project  execution,  cost  overruns,  and  poor  value  for  money  in  public  investment \nmanagement, all of which restrict the government\u2019s ability to execute pro-poor fiscal policies. \n \n\n                                                \n16 Government  of  Indonesia,  Indonesia  Investment  Coordinating  Board  (BKPM).  2018.

The RPJMN identifies income inequality, disparities \nin  regional  service  delivery,  and  low  investment  as  constraints  to  growth  and  development. \nTargets include annual GDP growth rates of 8%, average annual investment growth of 10.2%, \nand  a  reduction  in  the  Gini  index  to  0.36  by  2019  (footnote  7).  To  meet  these  objectives,  the \nRPJMN calls for structural reforms to stimulate investment in job-creating industries, increased \nspending  on  core  services  like  education  and  skills  development,  and  more  infrastructure \ninvestment through both public and private financing channels. These priorities are emphasized \nin  the  16  economic  policy  packages  issued  by  the  President  of  Indonesia  (para.  6).  These \npackages  seek  to  address  coordination  constraints,  cut  through  red  tape,  and  significantly \nimprove specific investment climate dimensions. Highlighted initiatives include regulatory reform \nto improve the business environment and facilitate investment, resolution of land acquisition and \nregistration issues that impede timely business development, and public procurement reform to \naccelerate investment and improve the quality of infrastructure. \n \nThe  policy  reforms.  The  program  supports  the  following  reform  areas:  (i)  a  more \n12. \npredictable  and  open  business  environment;  (ii)  an  improved  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  infrastructure  market;  and  (iii)  more  efficient  and  transparent  public \nprocurement.  During  the  processing  of  subprogram  2  in  2016,  the  government  agreed  to \naccomplish  eight  expected  prior  actions  (or  triggers)  and  10  policy  milestones  as  a  basis  for \nsubprogram 3.20 All eight prior expected actions have been completed. One policy milestone has \nbeen upgraded into an expected prior action to reflect the government\u2019s sustained commitment \nto improving the PPP enabling environment. One new expected prior action has been added to \nreflect  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  further  expedite  business  licensing  reforms.  At  the \ngovernment\u2019s request, ADB refined two policy milestones to streamline the policy matrix. Of these \ntwo, one policy milestone was completed and dropped from the policy matrix and the other policy \nmilestone  was  replaced  to  reflect  progress  in  streamlining  conditions  for  local  government \nborrowing  to  finance  infrastructure  investments. 21  These  refinements  have  strengthened  the \noverall impact of subprogram 3, which now contains 18 reform actions (10 expected prior actions \nrepresenting high-impact reforms and eight policy milestones), all of which have been completed.  \n \n13.  More  predictable  and  open  business  environment.  Building  on  accomplishments \nunder subprograms 1 and 2, this output improves Indonesia\u2019s business and investment climate \nby  establishing  an  institutional  framework  for  good  regulatory  practice  and  implementing  the \ngovernment\u2019s red tape reduction program. Mandated by a presidential instruction, the government, \nthrough  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (KKBP),  established  an  interministerial \ntask  force  in  2016  to  oversee  implementation  of  economic  policy  packages  and  guide \ninstitutionalization of the regulatory impact assessment (RIA) program. A new RIA unit was also \nestablished within the KKBP, and the Ministry of Trade conducted a pilot assessment of costs \nand benefits on key trade regulations. The government also continued to implement a red tape \nreduction program. Major achievements included (i) the implementation of reforms to consolidate \nbusiness  licensing  and  company  registration  into  a  single  application  process,  eliminating \nadministrative fees and the need for regular extensions, and (ii) integrating the issuance of permits \nfor construction within local one-stop service centers. Cost reductions have had a major impact \non business growth\u2014from 2015 to 2017, company registrations increased from 84,210 to 182,741, \nand  business  license  applications  grew  from  89,262  to  229,902.22 Cost  reductions  particularly \n\n                                                \n20 Prior actions are considered loan disbursement conditions and policy milestones that strengthen the program.  \n21 Summary Assessment of Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Trade. 2018.  \n\n\f5 \n\nbenefit SMEs, which are least able to bear high cost licensing regimes. Licenses issued by one-\nstop centers grew from under 10,000 in 2015 to more than 17,000 in 2017.23  \n \n14. \nThe  government  has  also  mandated  a  new  round  of  business  regulation  and  licensing \nreforms to expedite investment under Presidential Decree 91/2017, which targets rationalization \nof  existing  regulations. The decree  also  introduced  an  online  single submission  (OSS) system \nwhere investors  have a  single-entry  point for  business  licensing,  even  where multiple licenses \nacross various sectors and levels of government may be required. The OSS system features a \nnew  mobile  application  that  facilitates  communication  between  investors  and  government \ninvestment  facilitation  task  forces  and  allows  real-time  progress  monitoring  and  complaint \nresolution. Finally, the government reduced barriers to land registration and acquisition, including \nthrough the national rollout of an online land registration system to expedite registration at the \nlocal  level.  Under  this  system,  registration  grew  from  1.1  million  parcels  in  2016  to  5.2 million \nparcels  in 2017. These various reform  efforts  helped  improve  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  ranking from \n114th place in the in the World Bank\u2019s 2015 Doing Business report to 72nd in the 2018 report \n(paras.  5\u20136)  (Figure  1).

To date, seven projects have been supported through the project development \nfacility. New funding sources such as development partner funds were approved, procurement \nstandards improved, and operating procedures strengthened. The government has also clarified \nthe definition of unsolicited proposals and has issued guidance to relevant agencies to ensure \nsystematic  treatment  of  such  proposals.  Together,  reforms  have  had  a  direct  impact  on \nIndonesia\u2019s  PPP  pipeline.  Prior  to  2016,  the  government  had  limited  success  in  implementing \nPPPs other than a small number of toll road projects. Since 2016, 14 projects have been signed, \n12 projects are currently under construction (valued at $8.5 billion), and 2 projects have reached \nfinancial close and are being prepared for implementation (valued at $1.0 billion). The government \nhas continued to expand modalities for financing the public share of capital expenditures for PPPs. \nProject-based  sukuk  allocations  increased  to  Rp16.8 trillion  in  2017,  up  from  Rp13.7  trillion  in \n2016,  with  two  new  projects  financed  through  the  sukuk  modality.  At  the  same  time,  the \ngovernment has improved the selection process and criteria for project-based sukuk to improve \nthe quality, selectivity, and value for money of sukuk-financed projects. These innovative reforms \nrepresent  one  of  ADB\u2019s  first  engagements  on  Islamic  finance,  with  useful  lessons  for  broader \nregional  work  in  the  sector.  In  all,  2017  the  private  sector  invested  about  Rp8.2  trillion  in \ninfrastructure, up from an average of Rp4.7 trillion per year during 2012\u20132016.28 \n \n16.  More efficient and transparent public procurement. The government has built on the \ntools and systems introduced under subprogram 2 to strengthen governance, transparency, and \nperformance  under  subprogram  3.  Key  achievements  include the  introduction  of  an  enhanced  \ne-procurement system that integrates the reverse auction system, reducing procurement time and \nimproving  competitiveness  amongst  bidders.  The  government  has  also  strengthened  the \nmonitoring and evaluation role of the LKPP, initiating a procurement benchmarking performance \nprocess amongst key government contracting agencies. New procurement compliance controls \nto  audit  procurement  processes  have  been  introduced  and  piloted.  These  initiatives  provide \ncritical information to department managers, the LKPP, and the government executive, with the \ngoal of identifying and addressing systematic procurement challenges. These reforms effectively \ncomplement other ADB support on public investment, including a TA loan to improve engineering \ncapacity  for  project  preparation.29   The  government  has  also  strengthened  subnational  public \nprocurement by rolling out a local electronic procurement catalog and an electronic competitive \nbidding  platform  for  the  city  of  Jakarta.  Because  of  these  efforts,  total  public  procurement \nundertaken through electronic systems increased from Rp273 trillion in 2015 to Rp344 trillion in \n2017, generating an additional Rp62 trillion of savings.30 \n \n17. \nPost-program partnership framework. While nonbinding, the post-program partnership \n(P3F)  framework  provides  for  an  ongoing  dialogue  over  the  medium  term  between  the \ngovernment  and  ADB  on investment  climate reform,  as  well  as a framework for continuing TA \nsupport. To further reduce the costs of starting a business, ADB will support broader roll-out of \nthe government\u2019s good regulatory practice program (including the use of gender-sensitive RIA) \nthrough additional capacity building, as well as implementation of the OSS window for licensing \nthrough targeted review of reform action plans. ADB will also support innovative approaches for \nmunicipal  financing  of  investment  projects,  including  municipal  bonds  and  credit  guarantee \nfacilities. ADB proposes to support the P3F through a regional TA project that is currently under \n\n                                                \n28 World  Bank.

Beginning  with  state-owned  enterprise  reform  in  2001,  ADB  has \nsupported investment climate reforms through policy dialogue, loan programs, TA, and knowledge \nproducts. The 2006 Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (footnote 29) improved \nthe quality of infrastructure and connectivity across Indonesia and provided important lessons for \nfuture infrastructure engagements. By 2014, ADB began to focus on strengthening the investment \nclimate  under  an  integrated  sector  approach.  In  2016,  ADB  supported  infrastructure  delivery \nthrough a TA loan of $148 million to develop capacity for engineering services (footnote 29). This \nprogram  complements  other  ADB  support  in  Indonesia,  including  programmatic  support  on \nfinancial  market  development  and  inclusion,  an  inclusive  energy  program  to  strengthen \ninvestment conditions and improve access to core services, and programmatic support to better \nalign  fiscal  policy  and  expenditure  management  with  sustainable  development  goals. 32 \nDetermined to further capitalize on the reform momentum, the government has requested, and \nADB is considering, a second-generation investment climate reform program covering 2020\u20132025. \n \n19.  \nLessons. The program design has benefited from the following lessons. First, a focused \napproach  to  reform  is  critical  where  operations  cover  multiple  sectors.  Reforms  should  be \nprioritized considering institutional readiness at all levels. For example, institutionalization of good \nregulatory practice lacked traction in Indonesia until the Ministry of Trade demonstrated readiness \nto serve as a concrete pilot for conducting RIA. Second, the complexity and multi-sector nature \nof investment climate reforms require an executing agency with strong convening power and the \nmandate and incentive to coordinate across multiple sectors. The program\u2019s partnership with the \n                                                \n31 ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance Report: Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program.

Third, complex multi-sector reforms demand a regular review of binding constraints \nand proposed solutions. The program\u2019s initial efforts focused primarily on the central government. \nHowever, the magnitude of Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure deficiency soon revealed that the gap can \nonly  be  filled  with  the  engagement  of  multiple  partners,  particularly  those  outside  the  central \ngovernment. As such, the program deliberately chose to emphasize both local government and \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure investment in subprograms 2 and 3. \n \nADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB plays a lead role \n20. \nin  supporting  investment  climate  reform  in  Indonesia.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  and \nstructured  policy  dialogue  has  helped  ensure  that  reform  measures  are  well  coordinated  and \nproperly sequenced, and that policy actions were well designed. Under this program, ADB helped \nto identify and address business climate impediments, legal and regulatory issues constraining \nPPPs, and public procurement reforms. ADB supported a more open and predictable business \nenvironment by implementing good regulatory practices, including establishing the RIA oversight \noffice  at  the  KKBP.  ADB  also  supported  operationalization  of  the  OSS  initiative.  ADB  has \ncontributed  to  the  PPP  policy  framework  and  has  supported  a  knowledge  exchange  with  the \nPhilippines on the treatment of unsolicited PPP proposals, where it has strong experience. ADB \nalso  supported  the  development  of  new  selection  criteria  for  projects  financed  by  sukuk.  ADB \nsupported  procurement  benchmarking  exercises  for  spending  agencies,  which  improved  the \nanalytical basis for LKPP\u2019s monitoring and oversight function.  These measures have improved \nthe speed, efficiency, and quality of public procurement in Indonesia. \n \n21. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW \nprovided  joint  collaborative  financing  of  $245  million  in  for  subprogram  1,  $225  million  for \nsubprogram 2, and an indicative \u20ac200 million for subprogram 3. ADB and KfW have carried out \njoint  program  reviews  in  Jakarta  and,  together  with  the  government,  have  formulated  \nsubprogram  3.  At  a  technical  level,  ADB  coordinated  with  KfW  on  improving  the  legal  and \nregulatory  conditions  for  local  government  borrowing  to  finance  infrastructure  projects.  KfW \nsupported a knowledge exchange and study program that contributed to streamlined procedures \nand other regulatory reforms. ADB also partnered with the Government of Switzerland on a $5 \nmillion  TA  project  on  local  tax  for the  Jakarta government  and other  municipalities.33 ADB  has \ncoordinated  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment on improving regulatory practice in Indonesia. The World Bank has developed an \nRIA toolkit and worked with Indonesia\u2019s National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) on \nits review of existing regulations, complementing ADB\u2019s capacity building efforts with the KKBP \nand  other  partners.  ADB  also  coordinated  with  the  Australian\u2013Indonesian  Partnership  for \nEconomic Growth  to  develop  the  OSS  system  for  business  licensing  and  the  communications \nprotocols  to  manage  investor\u2013taskforce  interactions.  ADB  coordinated  with  the  IMF  on \nIndonesia\u2019s structural reform program and macro-fiscal framework. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nEconomic impact of the program. Strong investment is a key component of inclusive \ngrowth  and  helps  countries  overcome  middle  income  constraints.34 The  program  is  achieving \nresults:  under  subprogram  1,  trade  liberalization  efforts  reduced  the  amount  of  closed  and \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n33 ADB. 2015.

These  efforts  contributed  to  an  increase  in  net  foreign  direct \ninvestment  inflows  from  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2013  to  1.7%  in  2014  and  2016,  and  2.0%  in  2017 \n(footnote 18). Subprogram 3 continues with positive economy-wide effects. The program impact \nassessment estimates the potential net quantifiable benefits of the program at $8.7 billion under \nconservative discounting assumptions. Of this total, about $4.7 billion accrues from the impact of \nincreased  trade and foreign investment  inflows  caused  by  strengthening the  business  climate, \nimproving the regulatory framework, and facilitating the ease of starting a business at the central \nand local levels. An additional $1.8 billion will be derived from improvements to the framework for \nPPP projects and streamlined land acquisition and local borrowing procedures. Improvements in \npublic procurement are also expected to have a net present benefit of $2.3 billion. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  government  requested  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB's  ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 3.35 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest rate determined in  accordance with ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such \nother  terms  and  conditions set forth in the  draft  loan agreement.  The  average loan maturity  is  \n9.25  years,  and  no  maturity  premium  is  payable  to  ADB.  German  development  cooperation \nthrough KfW is providing collaborative financing for subprogram 3 (para. 21). The government\u2019s \ngross financing need in 2018 is $58.4 billion, with a budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP. To finance the \ndeficit, the government plans to raise $43.8 billion from the issuance of securities and $3.8 billion \nfrom official foreign loans. The size of subprogram 3 primarily reflects the government\u2019s financing \nneeds, the strength of the reform program, and the net economic benefits (para. 22). \n \nE. \n \n24. \nThe KKBP, the executing agency, will be responsible for coordinating the government\u2019s \neconomic reform packages. The Ministry of Finance, Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board \n(BKPM), Ministry of Agrarian and Spatial Planning, PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (a state-owned \ninfrastructure  financing  company),  and  LKPP  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nimplementation of program policy actions will be monitored through a steering committee chaired \nby a deputy minister of the executing agency and consisting of senior representatives from the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  from  July  2016  to  June  2018  for \nsubprogram 3. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nSafeguards.

Improvements in \n\n                                                \n35 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n\n\f10 \n\nthe regulatory framework reduce the costs of starting a business, especially for SMEs. Given the \nmacro nature of the program\u2019s reforms, no gender benefits are directly observed.36 \n \n27. \nGovernance. Public financial management continues to improve. The recent introduction \nof new tools, such as the KRISNA integrated budget and planning system, have aligned planning \nand budget  processes  under  a  consolidated  performance framework. 37 This  has  improved  the \npolicy basis of budget planning and tracking. Efforts to improve financial controls have increased \nsignificantly, with more than 70% of government agencies receiving an unqualified audit opinion \nfrom the external audit agency in 2017, up from just 40% in 2009. The move toward electronic \ndelivery  of  licensing,  procurement,  and  other  government  services  increases  automation  and \nreduces further opportunities for human interference and leakages. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and KKBP. \n \nRisks  and  Mitigating  Measures.  The  program  has  one  substantial  risk. 38  Effective \n28. \ncoordination  on  structural  reforms  is  necessary  for  successful  implementation.  To  date, \ncoordination  risks  have been  mitigated  by  the  strong  role  of  the  President\u2019s  office  through  the \neconomic policy packages. However, there is a risk that new packages will become less strategic \nand will be politicized, especially in the context of the upcoming general elections in April 2019. \nTo  mitigate  this  risk,  ADB  is  working  with  the  KKBP  to  strengthen  their  role  to  lead  the \nimplementation  of  policy  packages,  and  to  facilitate  and  coordinate  good  regulatory  reform \nthrough  their  role  in  steering  institutionalization  of  RIA.  Additionally,  ADB  is  providing  capacity \nbuilding to the KKBP to institutionalize the RIA process. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n \n29. \nThe government and KKBP have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreements. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n30. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan  of  $500,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  subprogram  3  of  the  Stepping  Up \nInvestments for Growth Acceleration Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular \nterms,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nloan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n18 May 2018\n\n                                                \n36 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 This is a specialized budget module linked to the national integrated financial management system that was used by \n\nall line agencies for the preparation of the 2018 budget. \n\n38 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nRisks \n\n \nExpected \neconomic \ngrowth \ninsufficient to \ncreate needed \njobs \n\n \n \nPoor \ncoordination \nbetween \ngovernment \nagencies on \nstructural \nreforms \nconstrains their \nimpact and \neffectiveness \n\nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objectives \nInvestment as a share of GDP increased (National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019)a \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nResults \nChain \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nEffect of the \nReform \nPublic and \nprivate sector \ninvestments \nincreased \n\nReform \nAreas Under \nSubprogram \n3 \n1.
