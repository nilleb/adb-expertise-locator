The  project\u2019s \nimpact  is  per  capita  income  increased  and  poverty  among  rural  and  pastoral  communities \nreduced. The current project has three outputs (para. 7). The additional financing will expand the \nscope of output 3 to include additional watershed subprojects. Panj\u2013Amu River Basin is a major \nproduction center for wheat, rice, vegetables, and fruit. Subproject investments will target water \nharvesting  to  increase  water  availability  by  increasing  underground  water  recharge,  improving \naccess,  and  reducing  water  runoff  and  flood  damage.  The  report  and  recommendation  of  the \nPresident for the ongoing project is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  proposed  project  meets  the  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  The  original \nproject\u2019s rating is on-track. The project outcomes will be achieved by the original project\u2019s closing \ndate of 31 May 2023. Physical progress was about 47% 3 as of 31 August 2020 (elapsed time: \n55%).  Cumulative  contract  awards  were  $42.31  million  (57%)  while  disbursements  were \n$13.76 million (18%). Outputs 2 and 3 of the original project are progressing well. Output 1 initial \ndelays  were  rectified.  The  original  project  complies  with  fiduciary  requirements,  environmental \nand social safeguard policies, and is successful in risk management. The midterm review found \nno  issues  with  grant  covenant  compliance,  except  for  the  covenant  on  the  preparation  and \nissuance of an operation and maintenance (O&M) policy. \n \nResponding  to  the  severe  climate  events\u2014namely,  a  large-scale  drought  in  2018  and \n4. \nsevere floods in 2019\u2014the government prioritized water harvesting. 4 As per the national water \nharvesting  program,  the  National  Water  Affairs  Regulation  Authority  (NWARA) 5 identified  and \nprepared prefeasibility studies on 334 subprojects, with many being small to medium scale (8\u2013\n11,500  hectares  [ha]).  Given  the  good  progress  under  output  3  (para.  8),  the  government \nrequested ADB support to expand its watershed interventions in the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin. The \nadditional  financing  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Afghanistan, \n2017\u22122021. 6  It  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operation  business  plan  for  Afghanistan, \n2020\u22122022. 7 It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  addressing  poverty \nand  gender  equality,    tackling  climate  change  and  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience, \n\n \n1  ADB. 2016.

The government is tackling the COVID-19 epidemic \nwith a national COVID-19 program and targeted social welfare support.  \n \nThis project is relevant and appropriate in the current Afghanistan COVID-19 environment, \n6. \nas it is focused on smallholder households and local communities, with activities that will generate \nimproved household incomes, livelihoods and employment. The project will have a direct local \nimpact  with  improved  livelihoods,  decreasing  poverty  and  food  insecurity.  The  employment \ngenerated may benefit those workers who have lost employment in off-farm activities that have \nclosed  due  to  COVID-19.  The  improved  livelihoods  will  enable  households  to  access  health \nservices if they are affected by COVID-19. \n \nThe additional financing will enhance resilience of watersheds to disaster and climate risks \n7. \nby adding 77 watershed subprojects under output 3. 9 The new activities will be completed within \nthe original project period ending 31 May 2023. The additional financing modality is appropriate 10 \nsince  the  activities  supplement  activities  of  the  original  project.  The  original  project\u2019s  sector \nmodality, design, and implementation arrangements can also be used efficiently.  \n \n8. \nThe  project  follows  the  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situations  and  enhanced  project \ndelivery  approaches  and  includes:  (i)  sector  financing,  which  allows  flexibility  in  subproject \nselection and implementation given security concerns; (ii) streamlined project management office \nstructure,  which  helps  long-term  programmatic  sector  interventions;  and  (iii)  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  and  involvement  of  local  elders,  which  minimizes  interruption \n(including security) of work. The project readiness is enhanced by the advance contracting. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe project is aligned with the following impacts: per capita income increased and poverty \namong rural and pastoral communities reduced. 11 The project will have the following outcome: \nagricultural  productivity  in  the  Panj\u2013Amu  River  Basin  increased. 12 The  project  outputs  are  (i) \nwater  allocation  and  availability  improved,  (ii)  command  areas  enhanced;  and  (iii)  watersheds \nproperly managed and protected. The impact, outcome, and outputs will remain unchanged for \nthe overall project.  \n \n10. \nUnder  output  3  of  the  original  project,  activities  are  being  undertaken  for 26  watershed \nsubprojects in three provinces (Badakhshan, Kunduz, and Takhar). Details are provided in the \nSummary of Project Performance. 13 With the additional financing, the project will expand activities \nto  an  additional  77  watershed  subprojects  in  the  existing  three  project  provinces  and  in  six \nadditional provinces: Samangan, Baghlan, Bamiyan, Panjshir, Parwan, and Wardak.

Activities under the additional subprojects will include (i) installation of physical \ninfrastructure and application of bioengineering (revegetation and reforestation) to improve water \navailability to rural households for irrigation and other uses, increase recharge, and reduce runoff \nand  sedimentation;  and  (ii)  preparation  of  watershed  resource  management  plans,  with \ncommunity-based  organization  engagement  at  subproject  sites  to  be  developed  through  water \nusers  associations  (WUAs)  and  community  development  councils. 15  Staff  training  will  be \nexpanded to cover the new subproject areas. Training will target river basin and sub-river basin \nauthority staff, local NWARA staff, and departments of agriculture, irrigation, and livestock (DAILs) \nstaff. The training will enable staff to become master trainers to train communities. \n \n12. \nAs  a  result  of  the  change  in  scope  to  output  3,  one  of  the  project\u2019s  original  outcome \nindicator targets will change: the target command area (irrigated agricultural land) for the overall \nproject will expand from 74,500 ha to 146,900 ha. \n \nC. \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  is  in  implementing  climate  adaptation  systems.  This  is  based  on \n13. \nwatershed land improvements through flood management and improved irrigation and drainage, \nwhich will improve rural livelihoods (including of women) and food security and reduce poverty. \nADB  support  will  also  target  sustainable  O&M  systems  and  building  government  and  local \ninstitutional capacity. The project is innovative in applying an integrated sustainable approach to \nclimate change and disaster risk management in upper watersheds. Subproject interventions will \nincrease  access  to  water  (e.g.,  water  storage  ponds,  check  dams),  provide  improvements  to \nprecipitation  infiltration  and  recharge,  and  reduce  soil  erosion  and  landslides  by  restoring  the \noriginal  vegetation.  Technical  packages  and  natural  resource  management  plans  will  be \ndeveloped  for  each  selected  subproject  site  and  adaptation  measures  adopted.  It  will  build  on \nADB\u2019s in-country extensive engagement in water resource management and rural development. 16  \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe overall project is estimated to cost $95.28 million (Table 1). \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plans \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n\nBase Costc \n1.

In 19 February 2020, NWARA replaced the Ministry of Energy and Water \n(MEW) for water projects implementation. 20 This change did not impact implementing agency\u2019s \ncapacity  as  NWARA  retained  its  functions,  mandates,  and  staff.  The  NWARA\u2019s  technical, \nprocurement,  financial,  safeguards,  gender,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  departments  remain \nunchanged.

The  full  due \n\nArea of Assessment \nTechnical \n\nEconomic and \nfinancial viability \n\nSustainability \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty, social, and \ngender \n\nTable 3: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \n\nSummary of Assessment \nThe project classification is high climate risk.a A climate and disaster risk assessment and \nmanagement report was prepared. All subprojects will be screened for climate and disaster \nrisks  and  will  incorporate  risk-reduction  measures.  The  additional  financing  will  use \nsubproject watershed designs and approaches that have proven effective under the original \nproject, and are within the capacity of local community organizations.b The interventions will \nincrease resilience to potential climate change impacts. They will increase water retention, \nand water access for households, irrigation and livestock uses, and water recharge. Slope \nstabilization with revegetation and reforestation will reduce soil loss and flood damage. \nThe  additional  financing  will  generate  significant  financial  and  economic  benefits  at  the \nwatershed and household levels. The analysis of two representative subprojects indicates \nthat  the  investments  will  be  economically  and  financially  viable,  and  directly  generate \nincreased levels of on-farm employment and incremental returns at the household level and \nincrease off-farm  rural  employment. The  economic  internal rates of  return  of  14.1% and \n31.7% for the two subprojects are above the opportunity cost of capital of 9%. \nThe local community organizations that will be implementing the subproject interventions \n(in  watershed  resource  management  planning  and  bioengineering)  will  achieve  higher \nproductivity  and  incremental  returns.  Higher  returns  and  improved  livelihoods  provide \nincentives for farm households to adopt sustainable O&M systems, including desilting and \nsedimentation removal on an annual basis. The government will ensure that, for structures \nbeyond  the  capacity  of  community-based  O&M,  adequate  funds  are  allocated  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s budget to finance the O&M activities of SBAs. For community-based O&M, \nthe government will ensure that pre-construction O&M agreements are signed before any \nwatershed and/or irrigation works start. SBAs and WUAs will sign handover agreements \nwith community development councils and other community organizations before any civil \nworks are commissioned. These agreements will also cover the commitments for O&M. \nAs per NWARA\u2019s financial management assessment there are no significant risks related \nto project management. Nevertheless, the over-all pre-mitigation financial management risk \nof NWARA is substantial. NWARA project management offices are experienced with ADB \nprojects. Under the original project, audited financial statements are timely submitted as per \nthe auditing standards acceptable to ADB, and internal audit reports are submitted annually \nto  ADB.  The  procurement  risk  classification  is  assessed  as  substantial;  procurement \nspecialists and staff under the original project will be engaged to enhance IA\u2019s procurement \ncapacity. All procurement and recruitment of consultants under the ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to the MOF and NWARA. \nThe national poverty rate in 2016\u20132017 was 54.5%. In the core project regions in the north \nand northeast the poverty rate was higher (57.9% in the north and 62.8% in the northeast).c \nSimilarly, the rate of severe food insecurity in these regions exceeds the national rate of \n45%. The project\u2019s watershed subprojects will reduce poverty and food insecurity for low-\n\n21 A technical assistant is programmed in late 2020, that aims to contribute to strengthening the capacity of government \n\nin improving sustainable infrastructure development in the sector. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nincome  and  marginal  smallholders,  pastoralists,  and  communities  by  creating  jobs  and \nimproving  water  access,  agricultural  productivity  and  incomes,  livelihoods,  and  food \nsecurity.d These interventions will also be important to support communities in mitigating \nand recovering from the COVID-19 epidemic. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming.  NWARA  and  MAIL  will  actively  engage  rural  women  in  the  community-\nbased organizations through community contracting and training courses. This will further \nimprove women\u2019s participation in irrigation associations. The additional financing will now \ninvolve women in managing watershed resources and creating livelihoods from nursery and \nforest  resource  management.  The  women  are  active  participants in several  watershed \nactivities such as community mobilization and watershed management planning. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  was \nprepared to ensure project compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). It \nwas  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  July  2020.  Adequate  resources  are  allocated  for \nenvironmental safeguards preparation, implementation, monitoring, and reporting.  \nIndigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples identified in project \nsite areas as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes. \nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The original project LARF was updated to guide \nthe preparation of subproject LARPs. Due diligence will be conducted in areas where no \nLAR impacts are anticipated. Upon due diligence completion and confirmation of no LAR \nimpact, a due diligence report will be prepared and disclosed upon ADB\u2019s acceptance. LAR \nplans will be prepared for LAR-impacted areas, accepted by ADB and disclosed prior to \naward of contract, with implementation prior to civil works commencement. Consultations \nwith the affected communities will be ongoing at all stages. ADB will recruit a TPM firm to \nmonitor project implementation to enhance portfolio monitoring and reporting.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, LAR = land acquisition and resettlement, NWARA = National Water Affairs Regulation \nAuthority, O&M = operation and maintenance, SBA = sub-river basin authority, WUA = water users association. \na  Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  42 of the 77 subprojects will involve community-based contracting.

The government and MOF have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement. \n \n24. \nOperation and maintenance. The government will ensure that, for structures outside the \ncapacity of community-based O&M, adequate funds are allocated from the government\u2019s budget \nto  finance  the  O&M  activities  of  sub-basin  authorities  (SBAs).  This  will  include  funds  for  the \nefficient  operation  of  sluice  gates  in  larger  structures.  For  community-based  O&M,  the \ngovernment  will  ensure  that  pre-construction  O&M  agreements  are  signed  before  starting  any \nwatershed  and/or  irrigation  works.  SBAs  and  WUAs  will  sign  handover  agreements  with \ncommunity development councils and other community organizations before any civil works are \ncommissioned.  These  agreements  will  also  cover  the  commitments  for  O&M  of  check  dams, \nincluding desilting and sedimentation removal. These will also be applicable for WUAs and the \nO&M and cleaning of offtakes. For other watershed management planning and bioengineering \nworks,  such  agreements  will  be  signed  between  the  SBAs  and  the  respective  community \norganizations to ensure long-term watershed sustainability. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n25. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$18,280,000 to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund), for the additional financing of the Panj\u2013Amu River Basin Sector Project, on \nterms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n6 October 2020\n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nAgricultural \nproductivity in the \nPanj\u2013Amu River \nBasin increased \n\n \nOutputs \n1.
