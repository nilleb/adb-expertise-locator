An  environmental  assessment  framework  is  a  core \nappendix,  and  checklists  for  screening  the  subprojects  are \nincluded as a supplementary appendix. \n \nThe Project will form part of the rural infrastructure component of \nthe Government\u2019s ongoing Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation \nProgram  (PKPS-BBM),  and  it  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  rural \ninfrastructure  in  about  1,800  poor  and/or  isolated  villages  in  less \ndeveloped districts in East Java, Nusa Tenggara East, South East \nSulawesi, and South Sulawesi provinces. The Project will follow a \ncommunity-driven development approach and will benefit about 2 \nmillion people or about 400,000 households. \n \nThe Government\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies \nlack  of  basic  infrastructure  in  the  rural  areas  as  an  underlying \ncause of poverty, and the Medium Term Development Plan 2004\u2013\n2009 (MTDP) identifies investing into rural infrastructure as a key \naction  for  reducing  poverty.  The  MTDP  identifies  investment \nneeds of about $145 billion in infrastructure necessary to maintain \na  sustained  GDP  growth  rate  of  6%  and  for  making  steady \nprogress  towards  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG) \nduring  the  planned  period.  Of  these,  public  sector  requirements \nare  estimated  at  about  $25  billion  for  infrastructure,  such  as  that \nfor  rural  areas,  that  is  traditionally  unattractive  for  the  private \nsector.  However,  investments  in  infrastructure  have  seen  drastic \ndecline from about $16 billion in 1996 to $3 billion in 2001 and to \n$1.5 billion in 2002. \n \nThe urgency of investments in rural infrastructure has further risen \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  ambitious  plan  to  reduce  fuel  subsidies. \nThe  direct  impact  on  the  poor  and  near  poor  of,  for  example,  a \nrecent 186% rise in the price of kerosene is potentially substantial. \nImpacts resulting from higher transportation and energy costs will \nraise  the  general  inflation  levels.  The  direct  and  indirect  impacts \ncould further aggravate poverty levels and may lead to slippages \nin  progress  towards  attaining  MDGs.  To  mitigate  these  impacts \nand  aid  the  poor  and  near  poor,  the  Government  has  adopted  a \nnumber of measures, including the rural infrastructure component \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nof  the  PKPS-BBM,  to  provide  basic  infrastructure  to  rural \ncommunities. On account of resource constraints, the coverage of \nthe PKPS-BBM in 2005 is limited to about 12,800 (about 20%) of \nthe  villages  in  Indonesia,  which  leaves  a  large  unserved  rural \npopulation.  In  2006,  the  PKPS-BBM  targets  an  additional  9,000 \nvillages.  The  Project  will  support  expansion  of  the  Government \nprogram  in  an  additional  1,800  villages  with  high  incidences  of \npoverty  and  poor  rural  infrastructure.  That  will  raise  the  overall \nProgram coverage to 23,600 villages. \n \nThe Project\u2019s long-term objective is to improve welfare of the rural \ncommunities, and the immediate objective is to improve access of \nthe poor and near poor in rural areas to basic rural infrastructure. \n \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  as  a  part  of  the  PKPS-BBM, \nwhich  is  estimated  to  cost  about  $698  million  (inclusive  of  the \nProject costs and beneficiary contributions). The total costs of the \ngeographic  slice  supported  by  the  Project  are  $60.82  million \nequivalent, of which $10.66 million (18%) is the foreign exchange \ncost  and  $50.16  million  equivalent  (82%)  is  the  local  currency \ncost. \n\nSource \n\nADB\u2013ADF \nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \nTotal \n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n9.18 \n1.48 \n0.00 \n10.66 \n\n($ million) \nLocal \nCurrency \n40.82 \n4.48 \n4.85 \n50.15 \n\nTotal \nCost \n50.00 \n5.96 \n4.85 \n60.82 \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n82.2 \n9.8 \n8.0 \n100.0 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  SDR35.08  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  8 \nyears,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  year  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per year during the remaining period. \n \nThe Government will provide the loan proceeds to communities on \nan  on-grant  basis.  The  grants  to  the  individual  villages  will  be \ndisbursed  in  three  tranches,  with  the  first  tranche  released  upon \napproval  of  the  community\u2019s  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  plans.  The  remaining  amounts  will  be  disbursed \nbased upon project progress. \n \nUntil 31 March 2009 \n \n30 September 2008 \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  30  months  as \npart  of  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Component  in  the  Government\u2019s \nongoing  PKPS-BBM.  It  will  use  the  existing  implementation \nmechanisms  that  are  in  place  for  that  program.  The  project \ncoordination  and  monitoring  unit  at  the  national  level  will  be \nresponsible for  the  management,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of \nproject activities. The existing provincial- and district-level project \nimplementation  units  will  be  responsible  for  providing  social  and \ntechnical  facilitation  to  the  communities  in  undertaking  the \nimprovement  activities.  The \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nNational  Coordination  Team  and \nthe  National  Steering \nCommittee, established for the PKPS-BBM, will be responsible for \nproviding guidance and oversight to the Project. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  through  its  Directorate  General  of \nHuman Settlements will be the Executing Agency for the Project. \n \nAll  goods  and  related  services  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will \nbe  procured \nfor \nProcurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. \n \nAn  estimated  702  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  8  person-months  of  international  and  694  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consultants,  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the \nGovernment in implementing the Project. Eight person-months of \ninternational, and 16 person-months of domestic consulting, along \nwith  an  appropriate  number  of  technical  support  staff,  will  be \nrecruited on individual bases, while the remaining services will be \nprocured  through  a  domestic  consulting  firm.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  system  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic \nto  ADB \nconsultants. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  2  million  rural  poor  in  about  1,800 \npoor  and/or  isolated  villages.  The  likely  types  of  infrastructure \ninclude  village  roads,  bridges  and  culverts,  village  irrigation \nschemes,  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes,  and  drainage \nworks.  Main  benefits  are  anticipated  to  include  (i)  reduced \ntransportation  costs,  (ii)  improved  access  to  safe  drinking  water, \n(iii)  improved  access  to  sanitation  facilities,  (iv)  improved  crop \nproduction,  and \nlong-term  employment \ngeneration.  The  experience  from  recent  projects  indicates  that \nsuch investments are economically viable, with economic internal \nrates of returns from the rural roads, irrigation schemes, and water \nsupply schemes ranging from 28% to 85%. \n \n\n(v)  short-term  and \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  main  risks  the  Project  is  likely  to  face  include  (i) possibly \ninadequate  preparatory  activities  on  the  part  of  the  Government, \n(ii)  possibly  inadequate  implementation  capacities  at  local  levels, \n(iii)  benefits  accruing  to  a  few  nonpoor,  (iv)  poor  governance,  (v) \nsustainability of the policies and investments, (vi) start-up delays, \n(vii)  delays  in  budget  approval,  and  (viii)  lack  of  adequate \ncounterpart funds. The Project design provides for measures that \nshould be able to mitigate or minimize the perceived risks. \n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \n\n1. \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe rural areas in Indonesia are home to the largest segment of the population and of \nthe poor. Based on official estimates,1 the number of rural poor in 2004 was about 24.7 million, \nor  one  fifth  of  the  rural  population.  That  represents  a  reduction  of  about  7.6  million  (about  7 \npercentage points) from the levels immediately following the 1997\u201398 Asian financial crisis. The \npoverty levels underestimate poverty, however, by not taking into account seasonal or transient \npoverty. An assessment of rural poverty,2 using the difference in incidence between $1/day and \n$2/day  headcounts  as  a  proxy  for  vulnerability,  reports  that  as  much  as  45%  of  the  overall \nIndonesian  population  may  be  vulnerable  to  periodic  shocks.  Although  separate  estimates  on \nthe size of the vulnerable population in rural areas are not available, the extent of vulnerability is \nexpected to be at least similar if not higher for the rural population. The vulnerable in Indonesia \nlive with risk as a part of their lives, and shocks at the national or regional levels can sink them \ninto poverty at any time.  \n  \nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  (PRSP) 3  and  Medium  Term \n3. \nDevelopment  Plan  for  2004\u20132009 4 (MTDP)  identify  lack  of  key  infrastructure  as  one  of  the \nunderlying causes of poverty. Poor or difficult access to villages mean that the communities do \nnot receive fair prices for their produce and they pay higher prices for their consumption. Poor \naccess  also  means  a  tendency  for  poor  coverage  of  public  and  private  services  and  higher \ncosts of accessing outside services. According to the MTDP, about 54% of the rural villages are \nnot connected through asphalt roads, and about one third of these lack year-round access even \nby  four  wheel  drive  vehicles.  A  quick  assessment  undertaken  by  the  country  poverty  analysis \nshowed  that  in  isolated  areas  dependent  on  non-motor  vehicle  modes  of  transportation, \ncommunities identified high transportation costs as a major cause of poverty. According to the \nNational  Socio-Economic  Survey, 5  more  than  40%  of  Indonesian  households  did  not  have \naccess  to  clean  drinking  water  or  sanitation  facilities  in  2003.  Among  rural  households,  only \n15%  were  obtaining  drinking  water  from  piped  or  pumped  sources,  and  just  21%  had  septic \ntanks  for  final  disposal  of  human  waste.  The  impacts  of  low  levels  of  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater and lack of adequate sanitation facilities contribute to high incidence of such water-borne \ndiseases  as  diarrhea,  intestinal  worms,  and  skin  diseases.  The  incidence  is  higher  among \nchildren and the elderly, and diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and stunted growth \namong young children. The infant mortality rate of 35 per 1,000 live births in 2000 is the highest \namong Southeast Asian countries. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Maksum, Choiril. 2004.

However,  the  investment  levels  have  dropped  sharply  since  the  1997\u201398  Asian \nfinancial  crisis.  In  current  terms,  such  public  expenditures  declined  from  about  $16  billion  in \n1996  to  $3  billion  in  2001  and  to  $1.5  billion  in  2002.  Declining  investments  mean  that \ninfrastructure  expansion  has  slowed  and  existing  infrastructure  has  deteriorated.  A  recent \nassessment6 has  ranked  Indonesia  at  the  bottom  in  terms  of  infrastructure  amongst  countries \nwith  populations  of  more  than  20  million.  According  to  the  village  potentials  survey, 7  the \nproportion of rural villages with year-round access by four wheel drive vehicles improved only by \nabout  2  percentage  points  between  1993  and  2003  from  80%  to  82%.  Over  the  same  period, \nthe proportion of villages accessible by asphalt roads declined by about 2 percentage points to \n45%  in  2003.  Between  1993  and  2003,  improvements  in  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nsanitation  in  rural  areas  were  relatively  larger,  at  6%  and  22%,  respectively.  However,  the \noverall coverage remains low. \n \n5. \nLow levels of investment have also had adverse affects on the sustainability of existing \ninfrastructure  and  service  delivery  levels.  According  to  the  MTDP,  the  condition  of  46%  of  the \noverall road network and 57% of the district roads is categorized as lightly to heavily damaged. \nSimilarly,  the  irrigation  schemes,  representing  an  important  infrastructure  element  in  the \npredominantly agriculture-based economy, are in a poor state. Up to 30% of the schemes are \ncategorized  as  degraded.  Appendix  1  presents  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  sector-related \nissues and experiences. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\nThe PRSP and Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy8 identify investing into rural \n6. \ninfrastructure as a key area in reducing poverty and regional disparities, as well as for achieving \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  as  these  investments  improve  poor  people\u2019s \naccess  to  services  and  markets  while  generating  employment.  A  recent  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  study9 confirmed  that,  in  addition  to  the  income-related  impacts,  investments  into \ninfrastructure  also  generate  such  non-income  impacts  as  improvements  in  health,  education, \nsecurity, and participation. Taking into account the potential role of infrastructure development in \nreducing poverty, the MTDP emphasizes the need for increased investments into infrastructure \nin general and into rural infrastructure in particular. According to Government estimates, in order \nfor  Indonesia  to  maintain  an  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of  6%  over  the  period  2005\u20132009, \ninfrastructure investments of $145 billion are needed. Of that amount, $25 billion in public sector \ninvestments have been identified specifically in such areas as rural roads, irrigation, and other \nrural infrastructure that are typically not attractive for the private sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Government Strategy and Program \n\nThe vision of the Government is to create an Indonesia that (i) is safe and peaceful, (ii) \n7. \noffers justice and democracy to all its citizens, and (iii) is prosperous. This vision is the basis for \n\n                                                 \n6  IMD World Competitiveness Center. 2005. World Competitiveness Yearbook.

These \nare (i) supporting job creation and poverty reduction programs; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic \nstability through stable prices, fiscal sustainability, and financial sector reforms; (iii) accelerating \ngrowth  of  investments,  exports,  and  tourism  through  reforms  to  create  a  healthy  business \nclimate  and  flexible  markets;  (iv)  improving  human  resources;  and  (v)  developing  the \ninfrastructure. \n \n8. \nIn line with its vision and strategy of policy and institutional reforms, the Government has \nadopted a policy of reorienting public sector expenditures from general consumptive subsidies \nto  targeted  interventions  aimed  at  the  poor.  The  process  has  been  hastened  by  the  rising  oil \nprices  in  the  world  markets,  which  led  to  substantial  increase  in  fuel  subsidies.10 Through  a \nfour-stage process, the Government has increased prices of fuel over a period of 8 months. As \nof 1 October 2005, the price increases for kerosene, gasoline, and automotive diesel relative to \nthe 28 February 2005 levels amounted to 186%, 149%, and 161%, respectively. The price rise \nfor  kerosene,  the  common  fuel  for  the  poor,  is  anticipated  to  directly  impact  the  consumption \npatterns  of  the  poor.  The  poor  will  also  be  impacted  by  increased  prices  of  gasoline  and \nautomotive diesel, as these will lead in turn to higher transportation costs and inflation.  \n \nWhen  faced  with  income-related  shocks,  the  poor  tend  to  liquidate  assets,  borrow \n9. \nexcessively,  and  cut  expenditures,  especially  for  nutrition,  health,  and  education.  This \naggravates  poverty.  The  increased  kerosene  prices  may  also  lead  to  adverse  effects  on  the \nenvironment,  as  the  rural  population  may  increase  its  dependence  on  wood  as  a  fuel.  Unless \neffective mitigation measures are implemented, the removal of subsidies may cause slippage in \nprogress toward achieving the major MDGs\u2014including those relating to eradicating poverty and \nhunger, providing safe water, and environmental sustainability. To compensate for the reduced \nfuel subsidies, the Government has initiated a series of targeted interventions to establish and \nimprove  safety  nets,  as  well  as  to  increase  investments  into  health,  education,  and  rural \ninfrastructure.  Some  of  these  are  components  of  the  so-called  Fuel  Subsidy  Reduction \nCompensation  Program  (PKPS-BBM).  The  Government  has  put  in  place  the  following  main \ninterventions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nUnconditional  cash  transfer. Cash transfers to an estimated 15.5 million poor \nand near-poor households. Allocation of Rp4.7 trillion ($470 million equivalent) in \nthe 2005 budget. \nPKPS-BBM\u2013Education  Component.  Operational  aid  to  schools  with  an \nallocation of Rp6.3 trillion ($630 million equivalent) in the 2005 budget. \nPKPS-BBM\u2013Health Component. Basic health care and health insurance for the \npoor  with  an  allocation  of  Rp3.9  trillion  ($390  million  equivalent)  in  the  2005 \nbudget. \nPKPS-BBM\u2013Rural  Infrastructure  Component.  Allocations  of  $330  million \nequivalent in the 2005 budget and a further $250 million equivalent in the 2006 \nbudget. \n\n \nPKPS-BBM  \u2013  Rural  Infrastructure  Component.  The  rural  infrastructure  component, \n10. \nformulated by the regional development directorate of the National Planning and Development \nAgency  (BAPPENAS),  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  and  the  State  Ministry  of  Less \n\n                                                 \n10 Based  on  an  average  crude  oil  price  of  about  $24  per  barrel,  the  original  2005  budget  provided  for  some  $3.2 \nbillion  in  fuel  subsidies.  With  the  rising  fuel  prices,  it  was  estimated  in  September  2005  that  the  annual  cost  to \nsupport the subsidies for the year would have been over $14 billion. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nDeveloped  Regions  builds  upon  some  of  the  recent  rural  development  projects  that  take  a \ncommunity-driven  development  approach.  The  approach,  closely  following  infrastructure \ndevelopment components of phases I, II and III of the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) \nand  ADB\u2019s  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Program,  provides  block  grants  to  the \ncommunities  for  meeting  their  priority  infrastructure  needs.  Each  village  is  entitled  to  a  block \ngrant  of  about  $25,000  for  meeting  its  priority  infrastructure  needs,  which  may  include  village \nroads, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation, and small fish landing facilities.11 \nA more detailed account of the PKPS-BBM is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n11. \nPKPS-BBM  is  intended  to  cover  some  28,000  infrastructure  projects  in  poor  villages. \nThe  2005  activities,  with  a  budgetary  allocation  of  about  $330  million,  aim  to  provide  basic \ninfrastructure to some 12,800 villages in 427 of 459 districts.12 Overall, the 2005 activities take \nin  about  20%  of  villages  in  the  country  and  about  45%  of  the  infrastructure-poor  villages.  In \neastern islands, where the majority of the districts are classified as less developed, proportions \nof villages not covered by the Program are high. Plans call for 2006 activities to cover another \n9,000  villages  at  a  cost  of  about  $250  million  from  the  Government\u2019s  own  resources.  The \nestimated  costs  of  the  PKPS-BBM  for  2005  and  2006,  inclusive  of  voluntary  community \ncontributions,  is  estimated  at  about  $638  million,  which  is  anticipated  to  be  supplemented  by \nadditional coverage through external assistance.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPast Rural Infrastructure Initiatives and Lessons Learned \n\n12. \nIndonesia has extensive experience in implementing both dedicated rural infrastructure \nprojects and broader rural development projects with infrastructure-related focus. The external \nassistance  for  rural  infrastructure  aggregates  to  about  $14.6  billion.  Of  that,  the  respective \nshares  of  rural  development  projects  with  infrastructure  components,  water  supply  and \nsanitation,  roads,  and  irrigation  are  $2.28  billion,  $0.60  billion,  $4.95  billion,  and  $4.77  billion \n(Appendix 3). The community-driven development approach has been tried and tested on both \nlocally  and  externally  funded  projects,  and  it  has  proven  successful.  Some  of  the  major \ninitiatives  along  the  lines  of  community-driven  development  include  the  Village  Improvement \nProject (1994\u201396), KDP phases I, II and III (1998 to date), Community and Local Government \nSupport  Program  (1999\u201305),  Poor  Farmers\u2019  Income  Improvement  through  Innovation  Project \n(2001\u2013to date), and PKPS-BBM Rural Infrastructure Component (2005 to date).  \n \n13. \nDespite  a  large  number  of  ongoing  and  recently  completed  projects,  only  a  part  of  the \nbasic  infrastructure  needs  of  the  rural  population  has  been  met.  In  aggregate,  recent  projects \nand programs have covered about 50% of the 68,000 rural villages in the country, which leaves \na  large  number  of  rural  villages  with  unmet  rural  infrastructure  needs.  Furthermore,  due  to \nresource  constraints,  not  all  basic  infrastructure  needs  will  have  been  met  even  in  those  rural \nvillages that have been covered in the past. \n \n14. \nprojects and programs: \n \n\nFollowing  are  the  key  lessons  that  have  been  learned  from  implementing  these  recent \n\n                                                 \n11 Both  KDP  and  PKPS-BBM  allow  for  support  to  development  and  improvement  of  one  or  more  infrastructure \nprojects through community-led implementation. Between 1998 and 2004, the KDP has undertaken development \nand improvement of about 56,000 units of infrastructure in some 28,000 villages. A recent evaluation of that project \nputs the average grant size at about $12,000 per unit of infrastructure, or about $24,000 per village. \n\n12 The  Program  excludes  earthquake  and  tsunami  affected  districts  as  well  as  some  urban  districts.  In  the  less \ndeveloped  districts,  30  to  60  poor  villages  per  district  are  targeted  by  the  Program.  In  the  better  off  and  city \ndistricts, however, coverage is a maximum of 20 and 10 villages, respectively. \n\n\f(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nrecruitment, \n\nPro-poor geographic targeting of project activities increases the poverty impact of \nrural development. \nCommunity facilitation in community planning and preparation is a key factor for \nsuccess  of  projects.  Facilitator \ntraining,  supervision,  and \nreplacement should be undertaken in a timely and synchronized manner. \nThe communities should be provided close technical backstopping to help ensure \nthat the design of the civil works is appropriate, quality of civil works is high, and \nany adverse impacts on the environment are readily mitigated. \nCommunities  should  be  thoroughly  briefed  on  administrative-  and  procurement-\nrelated  procedures,  so  that  they  can  monitor  implementation  progress.  Such \naccountability  procedures  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets,  tenders,  contracts, \nand  terms  of  reference  ensure  good  governance  and  help  prevent  fraud  and \ncorruption.  \nImplementation  arrangements  should  include  measures  to  ensure  that  minority \ngroups within the community participate and benefit from the Project activities. \nSimple  fund  flow  arrangements  with  direct  transfer  to  the  community  accounts \nreduce the chances of leakages. \n\n(vii)  Communities should be trained and facilitated in establishing effective operating \n\nand maintenance mechanisms. \n\n \nThe PKPS-BBM is in its first year of implementation. A full assessment of development \n15. \neffectiveness  and  adequacy  of  design  and  financial  systems  is  due  at  the  completion  of  2005 \nactivities.  As  a  part  of  the  Project  processing,  initial  implementation  of  the  PKPS-BBM  was \nthoroughly assessed through discussions with key stakeholders, field visits, and examination of \nrelevant  records  and  guidelines.  The  PKPS-BBM  was  found  to  be  well  designed,  ably \nadministered, and with sound financial management systems and fiduciary controls. In addition, \nthe assessment highlighted the following lessons based on the initial implementation: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nSimplified  implementation  mechanisms  and  minimal  involvement  of  government \nagencies at various administrative levels have been more successful. \nA fixed grant size may not be appropriate for all villages, as average village sizes \nand  availability  of  existing  infrastructure  greatly  differ  between  provinces  and \ndistricts. \nGrant size should be based on simple, objective, and transparent criteria so that \nthe  community  members  are  aware  of  the  grant  amounts  to  which  they  are \nentitled. \nA  longer  implementation  period  with  geographic  phasing  of  activities  within  the \ndistricts  will  help  provide  sufficient  preparatory  activities  and  avoid  bunching  of \napprovals for village infrastructure plans. \nA  longer  implementation  period  provides  opportunities  for  periodic  stocktakings \nand improving the Project design. \nSimple  and  objective  selection  criteria  can  help  improve  transparency  in  village \nselection and improve poverty targeting. \nSelection  criteria  for  infrastructure  should  take  into  account  financial  and  cost \neffectiveness considerations in addition to technical aspects. \nIn  addition  to  the  input  and  output  monitoring,  the  Project  should  also  monitor \nprocess, impact and outcome. \nProject  monitoring  and  evaluation  should  be  provided  dedicated  resources  to \nhelp avoid diverting resources and emphasis during peak implementation periods. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n5. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategy \n\nThe Indonesia country strategy and program update13 provides strategic support for the \n16. \nGovernment in critical areas, including (i) continuing support for implementing the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policies, (ii) supporting social development, (iii) promoting long-term economic \ngrowth  through  infrastructure  operations  and  private  sector  participation,  and  (iv)  furthering \nregional  cooperation  through  investments  in  the  transport  and  energy  sectors.  The  proposed \nProject  is  consistent  with  the  strategy,  as  it  aims  to  support  social  development  and  promote \nlong-term  development  in  rural  areas  through  infrastructure  improvement.  In  its  forward \nplanning,14 ADB  envisages  a  two-pronged  strategy  of  pursuing  a  greater  private  sector  role  in \nthe  larger  infrastructure  and  an  increased  public  sector  role  in  developing  rural  infrastructure. \nThe forward plans envisage rural infrastructure development as a key factor in reducing poverty, \nimproving MDG attainment in MDG-deficit geographic areas, strengthening rural-urban linkages, \nand developing rural economies. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe Government has requested ADB to assist in improving rural infrastructure as a part \nof its ongoing initiatives under the PKPS-BBM to mitigate the adverse impacts on the poor and \nnear poor of reduced fuel subsidies. The Project\u2019s long-term objective is to improve the welfare \nof  rural  communities,  and  the  immediate  objective  is  to  improve  access  to  basic  rural \ninfrastructure  for  the  poor  and  near  poor  in  rural  areas.  The  Project\u2019s  design  and  monitoring \nframework is Appendix 4.  \n \n18. \nThe Project will implement a geographic slice of the 2006\u20132007 PKPS-BBM where it will \ncover selected provinces in eastern Indonesia with poverty levels higher and achievement levels \non the Millennium Development Goals lower than national averages. The selection of provinces \nalso  took  into  account  the  number  of  less  developed  districts  and  presence  of  infrastructure-\npoor villages. The selected provinces are East Java, Nusa Tenggara East, South East Sulawesi, \nand  South  Sulawesi.  The  poverty  profiles  of  the  selected  provinces  are  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  A.  Within  these  provinces,  the  Project  will  focus  on  less  developed \ndistricts15 with high poverty levels, sufficient implementation capacities, and adequate numbers \nof  villages  that  are  eligible  for support.  Within  the  selected  districts,  only  those  villages  will  be \neligible for support that have (i) poverty levels higher than the district average, (ii) lower density \nof infrastructure than the district average, and (iii) not received support in the past 2 years for \ninfrastructure development. Inclusion of the more specific criteria adds objectivity to the village \nselection,  and  the  use  of  additional  filters  helps  target  remote  and  isolated  villages  that  have \nbeen bypassed by previous projects/programs. The list of selected districts and villages will be \nfinalized and submitted to the ADB prior to commencement of civil works and release of funds in \neach of the Project districts.   \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy Program Update 2005 Indonesia. Manila. \n14 ADB. November 2005. Draft Country Strategy and Program Initiating Paper for 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n15 The  State  Minister  of  the  Less  Developed  Regions,  in  Decree  Number:  001/KEP/M-PDT/II/2005,  of  7  February \n2005, defines the less developed areas according to criteria that include  economic conditions, human resources, \ninfrastructure, financial performance, accessibility, and social conditions. Using these criteria, the decree identifies \n199  districts  as  less  developed.  The  2005  implementation  of  the  PKPS-BBM  covers  the  entire  Project  area; \nhowever,  only  one  third  of  about  7,600  villages  in  the  less  developed  districts  of  selected  provinces  are  being \nsupported.  In  2006  and  2007,  the  non-ADB  financed  activities  of  PKPS-BBM  will  be  discontinued  in  the  Project \ndistricts. \n\n\fB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  comprise  two  components,  namely  (i)  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \n\n19. \nimprovement; and (ii) implementation, monitoring and coordination support. \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement \n\n20. \nThis component will target the poor and/or isolated villages that have not received recent \nassistance in rehabilitating and improving infrastructure. Following the PKPS-BBM approach,16 \nthe component will provide villages with social and technical facilitation and financial resources \nto meet their priority infrastructure needs. Likely infrastructure projects may include village roads, \nbridges  and  culverts,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  drainage \nworks.  Selection  of  the  infrastructure  will  be  subject  to  technical  feasibility,  cost  effectiveness, \nfinancial  feasibility,  and  screening  for  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Each  of  the \nparticipating villages will be eligible for a grant of up to $25,000 equivalent for rehabilitating and \nimproving  priority  infrastructure  needs.  In  cases  of  larger  or  very  less  developed  villages,  the \nProject  will  adopt  a  more  flexible  approach  by  providing  additional  grants  at  successful \nimplementation of a first grant, which will allow for improving the depth of support. In cases of \nvillages  in  Alor  district  of  Nusa  Tenggara  East  that  were  affected  by  the  November  2004 \nearthquake, the villages will also be entitled to further grants at successful completion of initial \ninfrastructure  plans.  During  implementation,  the  findings  of  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  special \nstudies will be used to assess the appropriateness of the grant size. If needed, then, the Project \nwill  develop  a  simple,  transparent,  and  objective  mechanism  for  introducing  flexible  sizing  of \ngrants that is linked to per capita infrastructure availability. \n \n21. \nThe component will follow a three-stage approach, wherein the first stage will include an \nawareness  campaign,  community  mobilization,  and  capacity  building  for  the  communities. \nDuring this stage, a given village community will form a community implementation organization \n(CIO),  which  will  elect  a  representative  committee  comprising  five  members  to  represent  their \ninterests. The members will include at least one female and one member from a minority group, \nif any are present in the village.  \n \nIn  the  second  stage,  the  community  will  be  facilitated  by  district-level  public  works \n22. \nservices,  with  the  help  of  village  organizers,  to  assist  in  planning  and  designing  the  priority \ninfrastructures.  The  design  of  community-selected \nrehabilitation  and \nimprovements will be based on detailed guidelines prepared for the PKPS-BBM and amended \nto incorporate ADB policies on procurement and safeguards. Upon approval of an infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  plan  (IRIP),  40%  of  the  grant  will  be  transferred  by  the  district \ntreasury  office  directly  into  the  community\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The \nremaining funds, subject to certification of progress by the district and subdistrict public works \nservices staff, will be disbursed to the community in two installments, of 40% and 20%, which \nwill be disbursed at the 36% completion point and the 72% completion point, respectively. \n \n23. \nIn  the  third  stage,  the  communities  will  be  facilitated  in  developing  and  establishing \noperating  and  maintenance  mechanisms.  In  the  process,  the  CIO  will  either  reconfirm  the \nexisting representative committee or will establish a new committee tasked with operating and \n\ninfrastructure \n\n                                                 \n16 The  community-driven  development  is  similar  to  the  approach  underlying  the  recently  approved  INO-Community \nWater  Services  and  Health  Project  (ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  Community  Water  Services  and  Health  Project. \nManila). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fmaintenance  responsibilities.  The  committee  and  the  CIO  will  be  trained  in  operation  and \nmaintenance of the scheme, and user fee mechanisms will be established, if needed. \n \n24. \nThe activities under the component will include (i) an awareness campaign to introduce \nthe  Project  in  the  participating  villages,  (ii)  capacity  building  and  facilitation  for  villagers,  (iii) \ndeveloping CIOs and building their skills in developing basic infrastructure, (iv) technical support \nto  CIOs  for  survey  and  design  of  proposed  infrastructure,  (v)  implementation  of  the  IRIP,  (vi) \nestablishment  of  effective  CIO  monitoring  and  reporting  mechanisms,  and  (vii)  facilitation  for \ndeveloping operating and maintenance mechanisms. \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B:  Implementation, Monitoring and Coordination Support \n\nIn general, Part B will support the implementation of activities in Part A. Main activities \n25. \nunder  the  component  will  include  (i)  establishing  project  management  and  coordination \nmechanisms,  (ii)  capacity  building  at  the  district  and  subdistrict  levels,  (iii)  providing  technical \nassistance  to  districts  and  subdistricts  in  facilitating  infrastructure  works,  (iv)  establishing \neffective  monitoring  and  reporting  mechanisms,  (v)  screening  for  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards, (vi) independent financial audits of Project and CIO accounts and finances, and (vii) \nassessing  design  and  management  of  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM.  Benefits  of  the  component \nextend beyond the Project, as activities such as assessment of the PKPS-BBM and expanded \nmonitoring and reporting mechanisms will also improve the PKPS-BBM\u2019s effectiveness. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nSupport for Government\u2019s Ongoing Program \n\n26. \nThe  Project  will  support  and  enhance  implementation  of  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM  by \nproviding additional resources necessary for expanding its physical coverage and improving its \nmanagement  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  Project\u2019s  approach  of  utilizing  the  design, \nmodalities,  and  implementation  structure  of  the  ongoing  program  will  help  to  align  the  Project \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  own  development  program  and  strategies,  enhance  ownership,  and \nimprove the prospects of achieving common goals of improved service delivery, achievement of \nMDGs, and poverty reduction. By taking advantage of the investments that the Government has \nmade in designing and implementing the PKPS-BBM, the Project will be able to achieve greater \nresource use efficiencies, and avoid duplications. \n \n\n2. \n\nBuilding on Past Experiences and Lessons Learned \n\n27. \nThe  design  of  the  PKPS-BBM  builds  on  experiences  gained  from  successfully \nimplementing  a  series  of  community-based  development  projects  and  programs.  This  design \nadopts  a  pro-poor  geographic  targeting  of  the  villages,  emphasizes  extensive  socialization  of \nprocedures  and  guidelines,  provides  elaborate  community \nin  planning  and \nimplementation,  utilizes  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow  mechanisms,  incorporates  checks \nand  balances,  and  emphasizes  operation  and  maintenance  of  completed  works.  In  designing \nthe  proposed  Project,  the  existing  PKPS-BBM  design  was  further  improved  upon  by \nincorporating \nimplementation.  Design \nimprovements  include  (i)  simpler  implementation  arrangements,  with  IRIP  approvals  at  the \ndistrict level; (ii) recognition of a need for flexibility in grant size; (iii) provision of follow-on grants \nin villages that are large or devoid of basic infrastructure; (iv) a longer implementation period; (v) \nsimple  and  objective  selection  criteria  for  districts,  villages,  and  infrastructure;  (vi)  due \n\nthe  PKPS-BBM\u2019s \n\nfacilitation \n\nlessons \n\nlearned \n\ninitial \n\nfrom \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fconsideration  to  financial  viability  and  cost  effectiveness  in  selecting  infrastructure  works;  and \n(vii) expanded monitoring and evaluation to include also process, impact, and outcome. \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Targeting \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  those  eastern  provinces  of  the  country  where  the \npoverty levels are higher and progress toward MDGs is lower than the national average. Within \nthese  provinces,  the  Project  will  target  remote  and  isolated villages  in  less  developed  districts \nthat are infrastructure poor and have not received any recent infrastructure-related assistance. \nThe systematic approach in selecting project villages and the nature of supported interventions \nshould ensure that the majority of benefits will largely accrue to the poor. Nonetheless, a variety \nof measures will be used to ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are particularly targeted by \nthe  Project,  including  (i)  representation  of  women  and  minority  groups  on  communities\u2019 \nrepresentative  committees,  and  (ii)  use  of  local  labor  and  materials  in  implementing \ninfrastructure. The poverty reduction and social strategy is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic Disclosure and Countrywide Dissemination \n\n29. \nThe  PKPS-BBM\u2019s  community-driven  development  approach  has  been  widely \ndisseminated throughout the country and is currently being implemented in about 427 districts. \nThe  detailed  guidelines  for  community  mobilization  and  technical  design  for  typical  rural \ninfrastructure have been developed in Bahasa Indonesia (the country\u2019s national language) and \ndisseminated to the districts and subdistricts. As a part of the ongoing PKPS-BBM, the Project \nwill  benefit  from  the  dissemination  activities  that  have  already  been  completed.  A  media \ncampaign  will  be  undertaken  in  the  selected  villages,  subdistricts,  and  districts  to  ensure \nadequate  awareness  of  the  Project\u2019s  approach  and  interventions.  At  the  village  level,  the \ncommunities  will  make  their  plans,  budgets,  and  financial  records  available  to  the  public. \nSummaries  of  the  plans,  progress  reports,  and  financial  records  will  also  be  posted  on \nsignboards within the villages. A flow of information to the communities will be encouraged by \nrequiring the districts and subdistricts to provide copies of the quarterly progress reports to the \ncommunities, which will help to cross-check the accuracy and completeness of reports. At the \nProject  level,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  disclose  the  Project-related  information  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s public communication policy.17 \n \n\n5. \n\nCommunity Ownership \n\nThe Project\u2019s community-driven approach will help develop a sense of ownership among \n30. \nthe  community  members.  The  experience  from  past  community-driven  development  projects, \nboth in and outside of Indonesia, shows that strong community ownership is often reflected in \nbetter work quality and voluntary contributions that are far and above the required contribution. \nA  recent  evaluation 18  of  rural  infrastructure  schemes  implemented  by  communities  in  KDP \nphases I and II shows that, on average, communities\u2019 voluntary contribution was about 17%.  \n \n31. \nAnother indicator of community ownership is the better upkeep and maintenance of the \ninfrastructure. Experience suggests that while the maintenance of larger infrastructure is beyond \nthe communities\u2019 capabilities, communities can maintain smaller infrastructure, if the community \nhas been fully involved in all stages of planning and implementation\u2014and including preparation \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

Selection  of  small  infrastructure  projects,  full \ncommunity  participation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  planning  are  integral  parts  of  the \nProject.  These  are  anticipated  to  lead  to  strong  ownership  of  infrastructure  and  improved \nsustainability. \n \n\n6. \n\nGood Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n32. \nImplementation  of  infrastructure  works  through  a  community-led  approach  is  the \nunderlying principle of the Project design. The Project clearly recognizes that administration at \nthe village level is the most transparent and democratic in the country and that there are several \nself-governing checks and balances at the village level to militate against corruption. Given that \nthe Project aims to alleviate poverty, the main thrust of the anticorruption agenda has been to \nensure that the beneficiaries directly receive the funds with the minimum amount of delay and \nthat there are no leakages at the village level. The communities will be involved at all stages of \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement.  The  Project  incorporates  good  governance \nthrough features including (i) advance socialization of the overall program objectives so that the \ncommunities understand the intentions, the outcomes, and the process by which funds will be \ndisbursed;  (ii)  a  detailed  and  consensual  approach  to  planning  so  that  the  village-level \nassessments  are  prepared  in  a  transparent,  consistent,  and  cost-effective  manner  with  clear \nawareness  in  the  communities  as  to  how  much  they  are  receiving  and  for  what;  (iii)  smooth, \ntransparent,  fast,  and  direct  disbursement  and  funds  flow  to  the  village;  (iv)  transparent \nutilization of Project funds at the village level, so that the utilization is adequately controlled with \nregular and transparent record keeping; and (v) comprehensive monitoring and evaluation that \nallows for an independent assessment of the  village investment outputs compared to the plan \nand overall program objectives. \n \n33. \nImplementation  through  such  a  transparent  approach  is  well  tested  and  proven  for \npromoting  good  governance.  Details  from  an  assessment  of  existing  financial  management \nmechanisms and fiduciary controls for the PKPS-BBM are included as Appendix 6. \n \n34. \nIn  addition  to  the  above,  from  the  perspective  of  good  governance  practices  in  the \nimplementing  agency,  the  Project will  incorporate  specific actions  to  ensure  implementation  of \nmeasures agreed between the MPW (then Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) \nand  the  ADB  on  11  June  2004.19 The  action  plan  is  given  in  Appendix  7,  and  its  features \nappropriate to the Project design will be incorporated into the loan agreement. Salient features \nof the action plan include (i) training of the national and regional Project staff in Government and \nADB procedures for implementation, procurement, use of consultants, disbursements, reporting, \nmonitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption; (ii) strengthening of contractual liabilities of \nthe Project\u2019s service providers and suppliers by including enforceable financial liability clauses \nin the contracts; (iii) including a clause in agreements and contracts with communities, service \nproviders,  and  suppliers  on  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  the  accounts;  (iv)  publicly  disclosing \ninfrastructure  plans,  budgets  and  cost  estimates,  and  implementation  progress  at  the \ncommunity  level;  (v)  publicly  disclosing  memorandums  of  understanding  arising  from  ADB \nreview  missions  and \nimplementation  progress,  procurement,  disbursement, \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  other  relevant  project  issues;  (vi)  developing  and \nimplementing  appropriate  web-based  information  management  and  reporting  systems  to \n\nregarding \n\n                                                 \n19 Action plan set out in an MOU was developed under ADB. 2002.

Specific  measures \n\n36.  Men  and  women  engage  in  different  socioeconomic  activities,  and  consequently  their \ninfrastructure needs are not necessarily the same. The Project\u2019s inherent approach will ensure \nequal  benefits \nfor  ensuring  balanced \nrepresentation and equal participation of genders in all stages of infrastructure rehabilitation and \nimprovement  include  (i)  having  at  least  20%  representation  of  women  in  representative \ncommittees, and among village organizers; (ii) ensuring at least 33% women\u2019s participation in all \ntraining  activities;  and  (iii)  screening  of  IRIPs  to  ensure  proportional  employment  opportunities \nfor women. \n \n\n8. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n37. \nThe civil works included in the Project will be limited to rehabilitation and improvements \nto  existing  infrastructure,  and  these  shall  not  involve  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of \nhouses, or land acquisition.  \n \n38. \nThe Project will proactively include indigenous people among its beneficiaries. Because \nthe  Project  will  not  involve  negative  impacts  and  will  be  fully  based  on  community-driven \ndevelopment  principles,  compliance  with  the  ADB  policy  on  indigenous  peoples20 will  be  de \nfacto ensured by the main design and implementation mechanisms. Nonetheless, the selection \ncriteria  for  infrastructure  include  provisions  to  ensure  that  indigenous  people  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  are  part  of  the  capacity  building,  planning,  implementation,  and  post-\nimplementation  processes,  as  well  as  that  they  will  benefit  proportionally  from  the  improved \naccess to rural infrastructure, the training, and construction-related employment opportunities. \n \n\n9. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n39. \nAll schemes selected under the Project at the village level will undergo rigorous technical \nand  social  evaluation  prior  to  actual  project  approval  and  implementation.  By  using \nenvironmental screening criteria specified in the environmental assessment framework given in \nAppendix  8,  only  those  schemes  having  no  or  very  minimal  environmental  impacts  will  be \nselected. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n40. \nThe Project will be implemented as a part of the PKPS-BBM, which is estimated to cost \nabout $698 million (inclusive of the Project costs and beneficiary contributions). The total costs \n(including  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during  construction)  of  the  activities  for  the \ngeographic slice implemented by the Project is estimated at $60.82 million equivalent (Table 1), \nof which $10.66 million is the direct and indirect foreign exchange cost. The balance of $50.16 \nmillion equivalent is the local currency cost. A summary of cost estimates is given in Appendix 9 \nand details are available in Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1998.

The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. A loan of $50.0 \nmillion  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  Special  Funds \nresources. The loan will have a term of 32 years and a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate \ncharge on the funds is 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n42. \nADB  will  cover  86%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  the  Project  and  81%  of  the  local \ncurrency cost, excluding taxes. The Government and the beneficiaries will provide $5.96 million \nand $4.85 million equivalent, amounting to 9.8% and 8.0% of the project cost, respectively. The \nfinancing  of  local  currency  costs  by  ADB  is  justified  by  the  nature  of  the  Project,  which  will \naddress regional poverty and vulnerabilities, as well as assist in achieving MDGs in relation to \neradicating  poverty  and  hunger  and  to  gaining  access  to  water  and  sanitation  services.  ADB \nfunding  will  cover  the  community  facilitation,  rehabilitation,  and  improvement  of  infrastructure; \naudits, studies, and surveys; as well as consulting services.

In the context of overall program, ADB financing \namounts to less than 8% of the costs. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management and Coordination \n\nThe Project will follow the established implementation arrangements for the PKPS-BBM, \n44. \nwhich  ADB  has  evaluated  and  found  to  be  satisfactory.  The  MPW  will  execute  the  Project \nthrough  the  Directorate  General  of  Human  Settlements  (DGHS).  The  existing  PKPS-BBM \nNational Coordination Team and National Rural Infrastructure PKPS-BBM Steering Committee \n(NSC)  will  provide  policy  directives,  guidance,  monitoring,  and  managerial  oversight.  The \nNational  Coordination  Team  is  chaired  jointly  by  the  Ministers  of  Coordination  Ministry  for \nEconomic Affairs and Coordination Ministry for People\u2019s Welfare, and the NSC by the Minister \nof  Public  Works  with  members  including  the  ministers  for  Finance,  Home  Affairs,  Information \nand  Communications,  Labor  and  Transmigration,  and  Agriculture,  as  well  as  heads  of  the \nNational  Planning  and  Programming  Agency,  State  Ministry  of  Less  Developed  Regions, \nNational  Statistics  Agency,  and  the  National  Audit  Agency.  Provincial  and  district  project \ncoordination  teams  will  also  have  multi-agency  steering  committees  formed  by  the  respective \ngovernors and district heads (bupati). These regional steering committees will have coordination \nand  monitoring  functions  similar  to  those  of  the  NSC.  Chaired  by  the  head  of  the  regional \nplanning  and  development  agency,  these  shall  be  made  up  of  heads  of  the  relevant  sectoral \nagencies  and  representatives  from  local  organizations  (e.g.,  parliaments,  public  organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  a  university,  the  press,  prominent  leaders,  and  the  general \npublic). All steering committees shall meet as necessary, and at least twice a year.  \n \n45. \nA project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU) has been established in the DGHS to \nwork closely with the PKPS-BBM multi-agency provincial and district project coordination teams. \nProject  assistance  will  be  administered  through  the  existing  project  implementing  units  or \nSatkers  (PIUs)  established  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels  under  the  respective \ncoordination teams. The national and provincial PIUs will be supporting both the Project and the \nnon-ADB  component.  Some  additional  personnel  will  be  deployed  by  the  Government  to  help \nundertake such activities as preparing withdrawal applications that will be specific to the Project. \nEach  participating  village  will  establish  a  CIO.  The  CIO  shall  be  either  an  existing  village \norganization  (formal  or informal)  or a  new  project  organization,  as  decided  by  the local  village \ncommunity  through  participatory  meetings.  Representatives  of  the  CIO  will  be  elected  or \nreconfirmed by the community and include a head, treasurer, secretary, and technical facilitator. \nThe Project shall engage a full-time village organizer elected by the local community to support \nthe CIO. The CIO shall be legalized by the village head and registered with the subdistrict head, \nwhich is a prerequisite for opening a bank account for the CIO. The CIO will be responsible for (i) \nidentifying social and infrastructure constraints in the village, (ii) preparing a village proposal, (iii) \nimplementing the approved village proposal, (iv) opening a bank account and making a contract \nfor  works  with  the  district  implementation  unit,  (v)  monitoring  on  a  daily  basis  the  construction \nworks  and  reporting  the  progress  to  the  district  implementation  unit  using  the  project \nperformance management system (PPMS), (vi) preparing invoices and cash management, (vii) \nholding  weekly  meetings  with  the  community  and  providing  copies  of  daily  records  on \ninformation  boards  in  order  to  report  physical  and  financial  progress,  (viii)  maintaining  a \ncomplaints system, and (ix) monitoring and reporting. To support the CIO, a management team \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  that  is  made  up  of  community  and  village \norganization  representatives  (excluding  the  village  head)  shall  be  set  up  in  each  village.  The \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nteam  will  supervise  infrastructure  construction  activities  and  infrastructure  management \n(including operation and maintenance) programs. Community facilitators will assist the CIO and \nvillage  organizer  in  coordinating  with  the  subdistrict  team,  as  well  as  in  overseeing  planning, \nselection, design, and implementation of the project activities. \n \n46. \n \n\nThe Project\u2019s organizational structure is in Appendixes 10. \n\n2. \n\nSelection of Village Level Infrastructure \n\n47. \nThe  selection  of  a  village  infrastructure  project  for  financing  will  be  subject  to  (i)  the \nendorsement of a village plan by the entire representative committee, including those members \nrepresenting women and minority groups; (ii) its providing proportional benefits and employment \nopportunities  to  women  and  minority  groups;  (iii)  its  having  a  village  infrastructure  focus  and \nleading  to  improvement  in  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor  or  near  poor;  (iv)  its  having  potential  for \nimmediate  utilization  by  the  poor  or  near  poor;  (v)  its  involving  only  the  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement of existing village-level infrastructure; (vi) its demonstrating economic viability and \nfinancial sustainability; (vii) its not requiring land acquisition or resettlement; (viii) its entailing no \nnegative  environmental,  social,  or  economic  impacts;  (ix)  the  construction  period\u2019s  not \nexceeding  3  months;  (x)  evaluation  of  alternative  designs  and  establishing  the  cost \neffectiveness of the proposed design; (xi) its utilizing local labor and materials, and, to the extent \npossible, employing technology that is simple or otherwise appropriate to local conditions; (xii) a \nvillage  walk-through  demonstrating  the  nature,  location,  and  impacts  of  the  project  on  at  least \n50%  of  the  village  community;  and  (xiii)  the  CIO\u2019s  having  prepared  an  operating  and \nmaintenance  plan,  and  concluded  a  written  agreement  with  the  district  public  services  to \nmaintain the works. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project activities will begin in April 2006 and will be completed over 30 months. The \n48. \nactivities will be undertaken in all the selected districts during the entire implementation period. \nWithin those districts, however, roughly half of the subdistricts will be covered in 2006 and those \nremaining during 2007\u201308. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nGoods and services financed partially or wholly by ADB will be procured in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.21 Civil  works  under  Part  A  of  the  Project  will  be \ncontracted  out  to  the  communities  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  community \nparticipation  in  procurement  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines,  with  a  contract \nceiling of $25,000 equivalent. A summary of indicative procurement packages is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nThe  Project  will  require  an  estimated  702  person-months  of  consulting  services.  This \nincludes 8 person-months of international and 694 person-months of domestic consulting, which \nwill  be  supported  by  technical  support  staff  and  village  organizers.  The  relatively  large  input \nstems  from  the  need  for  capacity  building,  the  assistance  required  to  support  the  highly \ndecentralized  implementation  arrangements,  and  the  need  for  intensive  interaction  with  the \n1,800  village  communities.  These  requirements  include  the  services  for  assisting  project \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2004. Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. Manila. \n\n\fimplementation  units  with  preparing quarterly  financial  monitoring  reports,  project  performance \nmanagement systems, and environmental and social safeguard screening. \n \n51. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  through  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants 22  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. About 8 person-months of international and 16 person-months \nof domestic consulting services will be recruited on individual bases through direct selection to \nassist  in  starting  up  Project  activities  as  well  as  to  assess  adequacy  of  financial  management \nsystems  and  fiduciary  controls  of  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM.  The  remaining  services  will  be \nprocured through domestic consulting firms using a quality-based selection method that requires \nsubmitting  a  simplified  technical  proposal  with  a  proposal  submission  period  of  35  days.  The \nquality-based selection method is justified to ensure recruitment of highly competent consulting \nfirms with the required mix of specialties, the demand for which has increased considerably due \nto the PKPS-BBM. In case of the consulting services solely financed by the counterpart funds, \nthe borrower may employ other arrangements that are acceptable to ADB. The outline terms of \nreference and details of consulting requirements are summarized in Appendix 13. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n52. \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy23 and specific actions listed in para. 34 are included in \nthe loan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, CIOs, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n53. \nThe  Project  is  classified  by  the  Government  as  a  national  project,  where  the  national \nGovernment will provide the loan proceeds directly to participating communities and district and \nregional governments on an on-grant basis. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. 24  The  Project  will  use  direct  payments  and  an \nimprest account. Direct payment procedure will be used for payments over $100,000. All other \npayments  will  be  channeled  through  the  imprest  account  to  increase  flexibility  in  project \ndisbursement. \n \n54. \nThe initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed $5.0 million or \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months, whichever is lower. Liquidation will be carried out \nunder  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure,  for  which  the  limit  will  be  $100,000.  Detailed \narrangements to establish the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedure will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended.  \n \n55. \nSufficient  supporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  the  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook, \nmust be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \n\n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2005.

The funds and document flow mechanism are in Appendix 14. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\ninvolved \n\nThe  DGHS, \n\n56. \nin  project \nregional  governments,  and  other  agencies \nimplementation  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  exclusively  for  the \nProject.  They  will  register  in  such  accounts  all  receipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and procedures. The CIOs will maintain accounts \nin  the  format  specified  by  the  Project  guidelines,  and  their  books  and  records  will  be  open  to \npublic access. The summary of the expenditures will be posted on a signboard in the village to \ninform  the  public.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  prepared  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  sound  and  acceptable  accounting  principles.  Audited  project \naccounts, audited financial statements, and the audit opinion must be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the end of the financial year and at project completion. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures should be included in \nthe  annual  audit  report.  A  formal  warning  will  be  issued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months \noverdue, and disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. The \nfinancial statements and the auditor\u2019s report will be in English. In case of any specific complaints, \nthe DGHS will contract an independent auditor, using Project funds, to audit the accounts at the \ncommunity and other relevant implementation levels.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA PPMS will be established at the national and field levels. The PPMS will encompass \n57. \nthe following elements: (i) monitoring physical and financial progress, as well as the efficacy and \nefficiency  in  village  infrastructure  implementation;  (ii)  monitoring  the  level  and  adequacy  of \nvillage participation of various stakeholders in planning and implementing project activities;  (iii) \ncollecting gender disaggregated data on stakeholders\u2019 participation in training and planning, and \nthe accrual of benefits including employment generation; (iv) monitoring social, environmental, \nand  economic  impacts,  including  to  establish  benchmark  information  and  data;  and  (v) \nassessing the impact and utilization of the works. The staff and village organizers will be trained \nto undertake baseline and completion surveys for the individual villages. PPMS findings will be \nincorporated in quarterly project progress reports to be prepared by the PCMU within 4 weeks of \nthe end of the reporting period and submitted to ADB and the NSC. The PCMU will also prepare \nand  submit  a  consolidated  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  will  carry  out  regular  loan  reviews,  including  mid-term  and  project  completion \n58. \nreviews.  The  reviews  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects.  The  reviews  will \nalso  examine  compliance  with  covenants  specified  in  the  loan  agreement.  The  DGHS  and \nregional governments will make sure that their staffs visit the field frequently and join ADB for all \nproject review missions. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Readiness \n\n59. \nbenefits \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  as  a  part  of  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM,  and  hence  it \nlarge-scale \n\nfrom  extensive  Government-led  preparation  and  experience \n\nfrom \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fimplementation.  The  implementation  arrangements  include  national-,  provincial-,  and  district-\nlevel offices. The NSC and provincial, district, and subdistrict committees are already in place. \nThe staff at all levels has been trained and is familiar with the approach. Villages in the Project \ndistricts  have  been  exposed  to  that  approach.  The  MPW  has  prepared  and  disseminated \nnecessary  administrative  and  technical  guidelines  for  districts,  subdistricts  and  communities, \nwhich will form the basis for the project administration memorandum. The terms of reference for \nthe  consulting  services  have  also  been  prepared,  which  will  allow  for  fast-track  recruitment  of \nconsultants. The Project does not entail any land acquisition or resettlement, which are often the \ncause of delays in starting up of activities. Overall, the Project is in a high state of readiness. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n60. \nInvestment  in  priority  rural  infrastructure  will  directly  benefit  about  2  million  people  or \n400,000  households  in  1,800  villages  in  the  Project  area.  It  will  build  capacities  of  local \ngovernments  in  about  40  districts  in  community-driven  development.  Anticipated  benefits \ninclude (i) economic and financial returns; (ii) improved quality of life, with reduced poverty and \nvulnerability; and (iii) increased community and local government capacities. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\n61. \nGiven  the  Project\u2019s  community-driven  development  approach,  the  communities  would \nprioritize their infrastructure needs during the implementation, and it is therefore not possible to \nestimate  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Project  at  this  stage.  There  is  a \nwealth  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  Indonesia  on  projects  pursuing  community-driven \ndevelopment and undertaking community-level interventions, however, and these could provide \nindicative  bases  for  anticipating  economic  and  financial  viability  for  the  key  types  of  project \ninterventions.  \n \n62. \nAppendix 15 summarizes the findings of evaluations undertaken on two recent projects \nwith similar approaches and grant sizes. The results indicate that irrigation schemes yielded the \nhighest returns, with the EIRRs for completed schemes ranging from 66% to 85%. EIRRs for the \ncompleted  water  supply  schemes  ranged  from  28%  to  36%,  and  those  for  roads  and  bridges \nfrom  33%  to  47%.  Using  a  general  income  multiplier  analysis,  the  results  indicated  that,  on \naverage, the investments generated additional indirect incomes 17% in excess of the amount of \ncash  directly  injected  into  the  village  economies.  The  results  also  point  to  greater  cost \neffectiveness,  with  the  works  undertaken  by  communities  on  average  costing  56%  less  than \nsimilar works carried out directly by government agencies or through contractors. \n \nThe  experience  on  these  projects  shows  that  the  majority  of  the  civil  works  are \n63. \nundertaken  using  manual  labor,  which  accounts  for  about  30\u201350%  of  the  civil  works  costs. \nUsing  a  conservative  estimate  of  labor  accounting  for  30%  of  the  village  grant  utilization  and \naverage wage rates for skilled and unskilled construction labor, it is anticipated that, on average, \nan  IRIP  will  generate  100  person-months  of  short-term  employment.  The  overall  short-term \nimpact  of  the  Project  in  generating  employment  is  anticipated  to  be  about  180,000  person-\nmonths or 15,000 person-years. \n \nOn account of the large sunk costs that the Government has incurred in designing and \n64. \nimplementing the PKPS-BBM, this Project\u2019s economic and financial benefits are anticipated to \nbe larger than if it was a stand-alone intervention. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\n65. \nThe  Project  will  target  poor  and  isolated  villages  in  less  developed  districts  that  lack \nbasic  infrastructure  and  have  not  received  any  recent  support  for  developing  or  maintaining \ninfrastructure. By virtue of poverty targeting, it is anticipated that the selected villages will have \nabove average poverty levels and will be below the national achievement levels with regard to \nMDGs relating to eradicating poverty and hunger and improving access to water and sanitation. \nThe water supply- and sanitation-related interventions are anticipated to reduce time and costs \nspent  on  obtaining  good  quality  water  while  diminishing  the  incidence  and  severity  of \nwater-borne  diseases.  Improvements  in  rural  roads  are  anticipated  to  increase  the  availability \nand  accessibility  of  education,  health  services,  and  natural  capital  to  the  rural  poor  and  near \npoor. A healthier population with improved access to services and markets, and with more time \nfreed  to  engage  in  economic  activities,  will  have  the  opportunity  to  improve  its  incomes  and \nwelfare. \n \nThe inclusion of women in planning, implementing and operational processes will ensure \n66. \nthat  the  Project  addresses  their  priority  infrastructure  needs  and  that  they  will  benefit  from \ntraining activities and employment opportunities. As women in these communities are typically \nand  mainly  responsible  for  collecting  water,  the  benefits  for  women  will  be  larger  in  cases  of \nthose interventions aimed at improving access to safe drinking water. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Benefits \n\nThe  adoption  of  a  community-driven  development  approach  will  lead  to  communities\u2019 \n67. \nactive involvement in prioritizing, planning, procuring, implementing, operating, and maintaining \ninfrastructure. This will empower these communities and will prepare them to promote their own \ndevelopment.  Improved  governance  at  the  local  levels  will  be  a  result  of  the  transparency  in \nimplementation,  whereby  all  decisions  will  be  made  by  the  communities  in  public  meetings, \ncommunity  accounts  will  be  displayed  in  summary  in  public  places,  and  those  community \naccounts will be accessible for public scrutiny. \n \n68.  While  the  Project  would  cover  villages  that  have  not  received  any  recent  support  for \ninfrastructure  and  have  little  or  no  prior  exposure  to  community-driven  development,  the \nparticipating  districts  would  have  been  involved  in  implementing  the  PKPS-BBM  and  other \nprojects  pursuing  similar  approaches.  In  fact,  the  Project  relies  on  the  awareness  campaigns \nand capacity building activities that have already been completed by the PKPS-BBM, and it will \nlimit  its  capacity  building  to  refresher  activities  and  improvements  with  regard  to  monitoring, \ngovernance,  and  safeguards.  The  governance-  and  monitoring-related  improvements  are \nanticipated to spill over to the PKPS-BBM activities being implemented within and outside of the \nProject districts. This will lead to improved targeting and accountability both inside and outside \nthe Project area. \n \nB. \n \n\nRisks \n\n1. \n\nAdequacy of Government\u2019s Preparatory Activities \n\n69. \nThe  Project  preparation  largely  relied  on  the  Government\u2019s  own  preparatory  activities. \nWhile  generally  thorough,  these  may  have  been  lacking  in  some  areas.  The  loan  fact-finding \nand  appraisal  missions  undertook  to  assess  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM  to  ascertain  any  such \nweaknesses, and, where needed, additional provisions were added to address these. To further \n\n\fmitigate  risk,  additional  provisions  to  address  any  weak  areas  will  be  identified  by  an \nindependent assessment of the PKPS-BBM planned for December 2005 or by the assessment \nof financial management systems at the inception stage. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Capacities at the Local Government Levels \n\n70. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  less  developed  districts  of  the  country  where  the \nimplementation  capacities  may  not  be  on  a  par  with  those  in  the  country\u2019s  more  developed \ndistricts.  The  risk  will  be  minimal,  however,  as  the  local  governments  will  benefit  from  having \nimplemented  the  PKPS-BBM  in  2005.  Thereby,  they  will  have  strengthened  their  relevant \ncapacities.  Nonetheless,  the  Project  provides  for  additional  capacity  building  activities  and \nconsulting services to help minimize risks related to capacity limitations. \n \n\n3. \n\nBenefits Limited to a Few Non Poor \n\n71. \nExperiences  on  past  rural  development  projects  show  tendencies  wherein  the  benefits \nare hijacked by a select few, and the needs of the poor largely remain unaddressed. This risk is \nminimized  by  several  features  in  the  Project  design.  These  include  establishing  the  CIO, \nelecting  community  representatives  and  village  organizers,  ensuring  representation  of  women \nand  minority  groups  among  the  community  representatives,  and  requiring  that  the  majority  of \nthe community endorse the plans. Furthermore, all the civil works will be contracted to the CIOs \nand will be largely undertaken through manual labor. That will help to ensure that the benefits of \ngenerating employment accrue to the community members to the greatest extent possible. \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernance Related Issues \n\n72. \nInfrastructure projects involving procurement of large amounts of goods and services for \ncivil  works  are  generally  prone  to  corruption.  By  adopting  an  approach  wherein  planning, \noversight, and implementation of the civil works rest with the communities, the Project promotes \ntransparency  and  good  governance.  In  addition,  an  assessment  of  the  ongoing  PKPS-BBM \nundertaken by ADB staff suggests that the existing financial management systems and fiduciary \ncontrols are sound and have adequate checks and balances to minimize the corruption-related \nrisks. The financial management systems and fiduciary controls of the ongoing PKPS-BBM will \nbe  thoroughly  assessed  during  the  inception  phase,  and  findings  will  be  used  to  additionally \nstrengthen the Project systems in order further to mitigate the related risks. Governance-related \nrisks will be further minimized by implementing the action plan that had been jointly developed \nby  the  MPW  and  ADB  to  improve  efficiency  of  project  implementation,  enhance  quality  of \noutputs, and prevent fraud and corruption. \n \n\n5. \n\nSustainability of the Policies and Investments \n\n73. \nThe  PKPS-BBM  is  funded  by  the  resources  reoriented  from  the  fuel  subsidies,  which \namount  to  about  $3.0  billion\u2013$5.0  billion  for  2005.  As  a  significant  proportion  of  the  subsidies \nreduction came into effect in the last quarter of 2005, the total of reoriented funds is anticipated \nto be larger in 2006 and the Government should have no resource constraint for sustaining the \nPKPS-BBM. However, there is a potential risk that a substantial increase in world oil prices will \ngenerate  social  and  political  pressures  on  the  Government  to  increase  subsidy-related \nexpenditures. That would reduce financial headroom for continuing the PKPS-BBM. This risk is \nreal but low. The Government has been committed to its policy, and it has so far been effective \nin countering the adverse impacts of substantial increases in domestic prices by initiating safety \nnets and development programs. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f \n74. \nLack  of  adequate  levels  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  could  drastically  reduce \nthe  useful  lives  and  benefits  from  the  infrastructure  investments.  Experiences  from  the \nCommunity  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector  Development  Program  and  KDP  phases  I \nand  II  show  that  ownership,  and  O&M  are  greater  when  the  communities  are  involved  in  all \nstages  of  implementation.  The  Project\u2019s  community-driven  development  approach  is  geared \ntowards \nimplementation,  and  post-\nimplementation  stages.  The  risk  is  further  minimized  through  limiting  the  activities  to \nrehabilitation and improvement of existing infrastructure using local labor and materials. Limiting \nthe  infrastructure  to  simple  design  and  focusing  on  the  existing  infrastructure,  in  particular  for \nirrigation  and  water  supply,  will  have  the  advantage  that  existing  mechanisms  could  be \nstrengthened  through  technical  and  social  facilitation.  Furthermore,  approval  of  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvement will be contingent on preparation of O&M plans. \n \n\nthe  planning,  design, \n\ninvolving  communities \n\nin \n\n6. \n\nStart-up Delays \n\nBecause  the  Project  is  envisaged  to  be  fast-disbursing  and  implemented  over  a  short \n75. \nperiod  of  time,  its  performance  will  be  sensitive  to  timely  start-up  of  implementation  activities. \nPast  experience  in  cases  of  rural  development  suggests  significant  start-up  delays  could  be \nexpected  with  respect  to  establishing  project  implementation  offices  and  project  steering \ncommittees, finalization of funds flow mechanisms, recruitment of consultants, and approval of \nbudgets.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  using  the  existing  approaches  along  with \nimplementation  and  funds  flow  mechanisms  that  are  already  in  place  for  the  PKPS-BBM.  The \nuse  of  established  mechanisms  and  trained  staff  while  providing  advanced  action  for \nprocurement of consulting services will minimize the risks of delays in project start-up.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDelays in Budget Approval \n\nOngoing projects have been experiencing systematic delays in release of budget funds, \n76. \nwhich leads to a shorter implementation period during a given year. The Government is in the \nprocess of introducing a new budget approval process, which aims to make the funds available \nto  the  line  agencies  at  the  start  of  the  year.  Nonetheless,  the  Project  design  addresses  the \npotential  for  delays  by  scheduling  the  consultant-  and  facilitator-led  community  mobilization \nactivities at the start of the year and civil works in the latter part of the year. \n \n\n8. \n\nLack of Counterpart Funds \n\n77. \nA recurring problem in the past has been the availability of sufficient counterpart funds. \nThis  has  led  to  implementation  delays  and  an  inability  for  projects  to  keep  up  with  planned \nimplementation schedules. The Government\u2019s strong ownership of PKPS-BBM and the Project\u2019s \nuse of existing implementation mechanisms will help ensure that the Project will maintain high \npriority  within  the  Government\u2019s  planning  and  resource  allocation  processes.  Furthermore,  the \nProject\u2019s  requirement  for  counterpart  funds  is  minimal  and  should  not  lead  to  excessive \ndifficulties in maintaining these levels. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n78. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\nThe  loan  and  corresponding  counterpart  contribution,  necessary  to  finance  the \nProject  activities,  will  be  made  available  throughout  the  Project  implementation \nperiod  by  earmarking  the  funds.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  project \ndistricts and CIOs as grant by direct transfer to local treasury offices. \nSelection  of  the  Project  districts  and  villages  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith  the  agreed  selection  criteria.  The  selected  districts  and  villages  will  be \napproved by ADB prior to implementation of any district level activities.  \nThe  selection  of  rehabilitation  and  improvement  works  for  inclusion  in  the  IRIP \nwill  be  based  on  the  criteria  detailed  in  para.  47,  which  ensure  that  indigenous \npeople  equally  benefit  from  the  Project,  and  that  IRIPs  do  not  require  land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement. \nNo  disbursement  will  be  made  for  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement \nunless the works are based on an approved IRIP, and a signed contract between \nthe CIO and the district project implementation unit. \nEach  Participating  Village  shall  establish  a  separate  Project  bank  account  for \nVillage-level  activities  funded  by  the  Project.  Funds  will  be  transferred  to  CIO \naccount  in  tranches  of  40%,  40%  and  20%  of  the  approved  proposal  for \ninfrastructure  improvement  and  rehabilitation  amount  based  upon  verification  of \nactual implementation progress by the relevant district PIU. \nSpecified  relevant  recommendations  of  the  MOU  of  11  June  2004  between  the \nMinistry of Public Works (then Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) \nand  ADB  on  improving  efficiency,  enhancing  quality  of  project  outputs  and \npreventing fraud and corruption will be implemented by the MPW. \nThe proportion of women participants will be maintained at not less than 33% in \ntraining programs at village level, and at not less than 20% in the representative \ncommittees and 20% for village organizers. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n79. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 35,079,000 to the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \nJoseph B. Eichenberger \nVice President \n\n24 November 2005 \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE \u2013 SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nRural Infrastructure Development in Indonesia \n\nSome  60%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas,  and  rural  poverty  remains \n1. \ngreater  than  urban  poverty.  In  2004,  11.4  million  or  12.4%  of  the  urban  population  and,  24.7 \nmillion  or  20.0%  of  the  rural  population  was  assessed  to  be  poor. 1    More  than  half  of  the \npopulation  still  lives  on  incomes  slightly  above  the  poverty  line.2 From  the  1970s  to  the  1990s, \nthere was little difference between poverty rates in the urban and rural areas, as the gap never \nexceeded 2.5 percentage points in either direction. Since, 1999, at which time the gap widened, \nrural poverty has been consistently 8 percentage points above the urban level. There is a strong \nlinkage  between  poverty  and  lack  of  access  to  infrastructure.  Improved  local  community \ninfrastructure can result in better health and education, safer water supply and sanitation, and \nbetter access to economic opportunities. All of these are basic rights stated in the Government's \npoverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), as incorporated into the Medium Term Development \nPlan for 2005\u20132009. The provision of infrastructure for poor communities will also help achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely targets 1, 3 and 10.   \n \n2. \nIndonesia\u2019s  present  investment  levels  in  infrastructure  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  are \namong the lowest in the region. In 2003, Indonesia's infrastructure ranking was last among 30 \ncountries  with  populations  exceeding  30  million.3 Total  infrastructure  spending  (including  the \nprivate sector) was 7% of GDP before the 1997\u201398 Asian financial crisis and dropped to 2\u20133% \nin 2000. The proportion of budgets allocated to maintenance was cut drastically. In all sectors, \nthere  are  significant  infrastructure  deficiencies.  Road  density  levels  are  1.6  km/1,000  people, \nwith  56%  of  the  total  240,946  kilometers  of  district  roads  classified  as  damaged.  Only  16%  of \nrural populations are serviced by piped or pumped water supplies. Electricity consumption is just \n319  kwh/capita,  with  45%  of  households  not  connected  to  electricity  at  all.  Some  90  million \npeople (mostly poor) do not yet have access to electricity. Only 3% of urban areas are served with \nfixed-line  telephones,  and  there  are  just  27  lines  per  1,000  people.4 The  estimated  need  for \ninfrastructure investment in Indonesia for 2006\u20132010 is $72 billion ($14.4 billion per annum).5 \n \n4. \nOf the 68,816 villages in Indonesia in 2003, some 83% (56,838) are classified as rural. \nDecentralization  has  led  to  significant  changes  in  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  approach  to \nregional  development.  Since  the  central  government  no  longer  has  the  power  or  resources  to \ndirectly  support  the  development  of  regions  in  the  way  it  used  to,  regions  are  forced  to  fund \nlarger  parts  of  their  own  investment  needs.  Domestic  budgets  have  been  insufficient,  and  the \nGovernment  has  increasingly  turned  to  funding  agencies  for  support  (See  Appendix  3.).  An \nanalysis of the number of villages supported by the Government\u2019s special Program Kompensasi \nPengurangan Subsidi Bahan Bakar Minyak (PKPS-BBM) and by the ongoing projects of ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  and  Japanese  agencies  suggests  that,  even  with  the  Government\u2019s  recent  focus \non rural infrastructure, less than 50% of the villages are being supported in the peak years. On \n\n                                                 \n1  Maksum, Choiril, 2004 Official Poverty Measurement in Indonesia.  Jakarta: Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics. \n2  The  poverty  line  used  by  Statistics  Indonesia  (BPS)  until  1996  was  revised  upward  in  1996,  leading  to  a  25% \nhigher  headcount.  Given  this  high  degree  of  clustering  around  the  poverty  threshold,  care  must  be  taken  before \ndrawing a conclusion that Indonesia is no longer characterized by widespread poverty. \n\n3  ADB. 2005.

The funding levels are far below the \nrequirements either to maintain existing facilities or to stimulate significant growth.  \n \n5. \nThe lack of funding for additional services is only part of the problem. In additional, the \nquality of services is poor, maintenance is minimal, and there is little community involvement in \nplanning, design, and construction. \n \nB. \n\nSubsector Analysis \n\n1. \n\nRural Roads \n\nthey \n\nlead \n\nincomes, \n\n6. \nImproving  the  road  transport  network  is  important  for  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  and  social  integration.  Providing  rural  areas  with  all-weather  roads  is  a  key \ncomponent of rural development and economic growth, and this would significantly improve the \nquality of life for the majority of people. Roads have considerable impacts on poverty reduction, \nbecause \nincreased  productive  employment \nto  higher  agricultural \nopportunities, and improved access to economic and social services.  \n \n7. \nAlthough the road network was reported to total 310,026 kilometers in 2000, roughly 5% \nof  the  population  was  not  reached  at  all  by  that  network  and  an  additional  3%  lacked  any \nreliable access to motorized transport. The national roads are mostly (81%) in sound condition, \nwhile  provincial  roads  are  less  well  maintained,  and  over  half  (57)  of  the  extensive  network \n(240,946 km) of district roads is in poor condition. \n \n8. \nRural road projects may be expected to contribute to (i) growth in agricultural incomes, \nresulting  from  access  to  higher  priced  markets  and  reduced  spoilage;  (ii)  growth  of  local \neconomies, leading to increased incomes and employment opportunities; (iii) the ability to travel \nto  jobs  outside  the  area;  (iv)  reduced  prices  for  consumer  goods  and  services  due  to  lower \ntransport costs; (v) improved health and longevity from access to hospitals and health services; \n(vi) improved education due to improved access to schools, capacity to attract qualified school \nteachers,  and  more  frequent  supervision  visits  by  school  inspectors;  (vii)  improved  access  to \nagricultural, veterinary, and extension services; and (viii) improved opportunities for participating \nin the wider society outside of people\u2019s home villages.  \n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\nProviding  access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation  is  seen  as  an  integral  part  of  overall \n9. \nefforts  to  improve  health  conditions  in  Indonesia. The  country  has  made  progress  in  providing \nclean  water  and  basic  sanitation  services  to  its  people,  but  standards  remain  below  those  of \nmany  other  ADB  developing  member  countries.  About  55%  of  the  Indonesian  population  had \naccess to improved sanitation and 78% to an improved source of drinking water in 2000.6\n These \npercentages  are  below  those  for  such  other  Southeast  Asian  countries  as  the  Philippines  and \nThailand. \n \nAccording  to  the  2002  National  Socioeconomic  Survey,  only  about  15%  of  rural \n10. \nhouseholds  obtained  drinking  water  from  piped  or  pumped  (borehole)  sources.  The  great \nmajority  of  rural  and  poor  households  still  collect  their  water  through  shallow  groundwater \nabstraction, rainwater collection, or from nearby rivers or springs. The majority of households in \nIndonesia use on-site facilities for sanitation, and access to sewerage is virtually nonexistent in \nperi-urban and rural areas. In rural areas only about 27% of households claimed to regularly use \n                                                 \n6  United Nations Development Programme. 2003.

As with water, \nthe number of people with lack of access to adequate sanitation is much higher in rural areas \nand among the poor. \n \n11.  Many rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia have priority disease profiles that include \ndiarrhea, intestinal worms, skin diseases, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and \ndengue.  Poor  people  in  remote  rural  areas\u2014and  particularly  the  children,  women,  and  elderly \namong them\u2014are more affected than others. While infant mortality rates under 5 years of age \nhave decreased substantially (from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1967 to 35 in 2000), these are \nstill above those of such other Southeast Asian countries as the Philippines (30) and Thailand \n(25). Diarrhea remains the second most common cause of death among young children, and it \nis the main reason that children\u2019s growth is stunted (particularly at 12\u201324 months of age). The \nsituation  results  from  inadequate  levels  of  access  to  clean  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ncombined with poor hygienic practices and behaviors. \n \n\n3. \n\nIrrigation and Drainage  \n\n12. \nAgriculture in Indonesia is dominated by irrigated rice. About 82% of the rice produced in \nthe country is grown under irrigation. Of the total irrigated area, 5.0 million hectares are publicly \nmanaged and 1.2 million hectares, all comprising small systems, are managed by farmers. The \naverage  cropping  intensity  is  155%,  with  an  average  paddy  yield  of  about  4.5  metric  tons  per \nhectare.  Investment  in  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  was  a  major  component  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural  development  strategy  from  1969  to  1999.  Irrigation \ninvestments were economically efficient, and these helped to improve food security and reduce \nrural  poverty.  As  a  result  of  these  investments,  rice  production  increased  at  an  annual  rate  of \n4.8%.  Intensive  cultivation  of  rice,  a  labor-intensive  crop,  increased  rural  incomes  and \nsubstantially contributed to reducing the incidence of rural poverty from 40% in 1970 to 16.5% in \n1997.  About  43%  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force  is  employed  in  agriculture,  mostly  in  rice \nproduction and related activities. \n \n13.  Mobilizing communities to participate in the irrigation development process is recognized \nas  being  key  to  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  existing  irrigation  assets  and \nappropriate development of new infrastructure. Currently, Government financing is significantly \nbelow levels necessary to maintain the existing systems. Some 60\u201380% of the available budget \nis  absorbed  by  regional  staff  salaries,  while  the  remainder  goes  to  emergency  repairs  and \nrehabilitation. \n \nC. \n\nInfrastructure  Participatory  Community  Development  Experience \n\nin \n\nRural \nIndonesia \n\n1. \n\nRecent ADB Project Design \n\n14. \nThe  generation  of  projects  formulated  under  decentralization  has  concentrated  on \nimproving service delivery mechanisms and standards. Many of these new generation projects \nwere community-based projects and achieved significant success at the community level. The \nparticipatory  evaluation  carried  out  as  part  of  the  country  assistance  program  evaluation  for \nIndonesia in September 2005 suggests that projects with strong participatory components have \nbeen effective in supporting village-level decentralization. In these community projects, project \nprocesses  have  played  an  important  part  in  promoting  greater  transparency  and  community \nauthority  in  decision  making,  as  well  as  to  make  communities  feel  empowered  to  challenge \nvillage  government  for  greater  political  and  financial  accountability.  Appendix  3  gives  an \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n25 \n\nindication of the wealth of experience in rural infrastructure development in Indonesia, and three \nrecent projects are described below. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunity and Local Government Support Program (CLGS) \n\nThe  pro-poor  CLGS 7 program  successfully  helped  to  build  capacities  among  village \n15. \ncommunities to identify, plan, implement, and manage small-scale infrastructure projects. It also \naddressed  governance-related  issues  of  participation,  transparency,  and  accountability.  Local \ngovernments  demonstrated  their  strong  appreciation  for  the  Project  and  its  contributions  to \nvillage  development  and  the  building  of  capacities  in  handling  bottom-up  development  with  a \nlarge  number  of  community  groups.  The  communities  and  particularly  the  local  women\u2019s \norganizations were a driving force for subproject identification, planning, and implementation. \n \n \n16. \nIn 79 districts, CLGS supported labor intensive construction of 17,237 public facilities. It \ngenerated 11 million workdays8 for 378,000 participants. The work was in the areas of (i) water \nsupply,  (ii)  drainage,  (iii)  irrigation,  (iv)  local  roads  and  bridges  (60%),  (v)  public  toilets,  (vi) \nmarkets, (vii) school buildings, (viii) sanitation (solid waste handling or disposal), and (ix) water \ntransport  facilities  such  as  piers  and  docks.  Loan  utilization  was  effective  and  efficient.  The \nCLGS  program\u2019s  community-based  development  efforts  are  known  for  their  high  degree  of \ntransparency. Communities have added substantially through additional noncash contributions, \namounting  occasionally  to  2\u20133  times  the  value  of  the  project  funding.  The  contribution  of \ncommunities  has  diminished  the  need  for  contractors,  and,  through  the  mechanism  of \ncommunity  supervision,  reduced  costs  for  subprojects.  Communities  have  been  willing  to \ncommit to operating and maintaining facilities built under the Project.  \n \n\n3. \n\nKecamatan Development Project (KDP)  \n\n17. \nThe  Kecamatan  (subdistrict)  Development  Project  is  the  longest-running  externally \nfunded  community  rural  infrastructure  and  livelihoods  project  in  Indonesia.  Its  goals  are  to \nalleviate  poverty  by  raising  rural  incomes,  to  strengthen  local  government  and  community \ninstitutions,  and  to  promote  good  governance.  Through  its  three  phases  and  with  funding  of \nnearly  $700  million,  the  KDP  has  so  far  provided  some  56,000  units  of  infrastructure  to  about \n28,000 villages.9 \n \n18. \nBy pushing decision making down to the lowest levels, the KDP empowers the rural poor \nand encourages more democratic and participatory forms of local governance. All KDP activities \naim at allowing villagers to make their own choices about the kinds of projects that they need \nand  want.  The  program  gives  power  to  communities  by  placing  funds  and  the  planning  and \ndecision-making processes directly under their control. The Project devotes extensive resources \nfor social and technical facilitation at the village level, which can typically be 4 to 6 months long. \nIn  open  public  meetings,  villagers  decide  upon  a  maximum  of  two  proposals  for  forwarding  to \nthe final round of subdistrict-level decision making. Later, during the subdistrict-level meetings, \nelected  representatives  of  all  villages  select  proposals  for  allocation  of  funds.  In  cases  of  the \nselected proposals, the block grants are provided directly to the villages for undertaking small-\nscale infrastructure, and social and economic activities. While the KDP does not fix the size of \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1999.

Project Appraisal Document Kecamatan Development Program IIIB. Washington DC.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nvillage  grants,  the  evaluations  show  that  the  grants  averaged  about  $12,000  per  unit  of \ninfrastructure or about $24,000 per village. \n \n19. \nInfrastructure  projects  (roads,  bridges,  clean  water  supply,  sanitation  units,  irrigation \nsystems, markets, etc.) received about 76% of KDP investments and economic activities 23%. \nThe  remaining  1%  has  been  utilized  for  education  and  health  activities.  Although  the  KDP \nadopts  an  open  book  approach  to  infrastructure  selection,  the  most  common  choices  for \nconstruction  are  village  roads  and  bridges  (44%),  water  supply  (10%),  electrification  (8%), \nsanitation (6%), and irrigation (3%). The evaluations show that some 54% of the participants of \nvillage  meetings  were  poor,  and  some  70%  of  the  workforce  was  donated  by  the  poor \npopulation. The high ownership of the project is demonstrated by contributions of the villagers, \ni.e., some 17% of project costs. KDP has also demonstrated strong benefits in achieving value \nfor money, good implementation quality, appropriate selection of infrastructure, good design and \ncommunity  involvement  in  operation  and  maintenance.  The  evaluations  undertaken  by  the \nWorld  Bank  rate  the  outcome  as  highly  satisfactory,  sustainability  likely,  and  institutional \ndevelopment impacts as high.  \n \nD. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n1. \n\nKey Experience from Rural Development Projects \n\n21. \nlocal \nCommunity-driven  rural  development  programs  operating  on  principles  of \nempowerment,  participatory  governance,  demand-responsiveness,  greater  downward \naccountability, and enhanced local capacity have been successfully implemented in Indonesia. \nExperience has shown that, given clear and appropriate implementation arrangements, access \nto information, and adequate capacity and financial support, poor men and women, working in \npartnership with local governments and other supportive institutions, can effectively organize in \norder to identify community priorities and implement works addressing local problems. \n\n22. \nPro-poor  targeting  of  villages  increases  the  poverty  impact  of  rural  development. \nImplementation arrangements need to ensure that within a participating community the vulnerable \ngroups benefit directly during implementation. \n\n2. \n\nDemand-Driven, Community-Based Development \n\n23. \nKey  lessons  learned  from  demand-driven,  community-based  development  in  Indonesia \nand other Asian countries center on the importance of (i) manageable geographic coverage of a \nproject;  (ii)  a  simple  technology  menu  for  communities  to  chose  from;  (iii)  engagement  of \ncommunities  in  the  whole  project  cycle;  (iv)  extensive  use  of  community  facilitators;  (v) \ncommunity  contributions for construction, and full responsibility for operation and maintenance \ncosts;  (vi)  close  monitoring  of  construction  quality  and  transparent  project  administration  and \nprocurement  procedures;  and  (vii)  community  participation  in  monitoring  and  evaluation \nactivities.       \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Design and Implementation \n\n24. \n\nKey lessons in project design are describe below: \n(i) \n\nIt  is  helpful  to  simplify  implementation  and  to  minimize  government  agencies\u2019 \ninvolvement at various administrative levels. \nRecent decentralization poses a challenge, in that more hierarchical levels want \na  say  in  project  implementation.  Advantageous  is  to  have  a  single  project \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nmanagement  organization  with  sufficient  authority  to  resolve  coordination  and \nimplementation  issues  in  a  timely  manner.  Where  feasible,  decision  making \nshould be delegated to lower levels. \nFund  channeling  arrangements  must  be  simple  and  directly  to  the  accounts  of \nthe village organizations, bypassing other institutions where it could be leaked. \nCommunity facilitators represent a key factor in ensuring a project\u2019s success, as \nthey  are  responsible  for  community  planning  and  preparation  before  the \nconstruction  of  facilities.  Facilitator  recruitment,  training,  supervision,  and \nreplacement needs to be delivered in a timely and synchronized manner. \nCommunities should be encouraged to increase their voluntary contributions.  \n\n(v) \n(vi)  Work  quality  needs  to  be  monitored.  Low  quality  of  construction  has  been \nattributed to requirements to use unskilled and untrained village labor, combined \nwith lack of supervision. \n(vii)  Monitoring  of  participating \n\nconsultants,  nongovernment  organizations, \ngovernment  agencies,  and  private  sector  organizations  is  crucial.  Communities \nshould be adequately trained to demand and recognize high quality construction \nand  assistance.  In  addition,  professional  and  regular  independent  quality \nmonitoring and control of activities is needed. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Ensuring full transparency and public accountability of project administration and \nprocurement is crucial to stimulating community participation and commitment to \nproject policies and procedures. \nSectoral  projects  are  notoriously  slow  and  cumbersome  in  implementation, \nleading  to  great  frustration  among  initially  very  motivated  communities.  To \naddress  this,  advance  actions  well  in  advance  of  project  implementation  are \nneeded  in  establishing  and  staffing  central-  and  district-level  project  offices  and \nrecruiting central-level consultants. \nAdministration  and  procurement  procedures  should  be  clearly  explained  to \ncommunities so that they are capable of monitoring progress from their side, as \nwell.  Such  accountability  procedures  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets,  tenders, \ncontracts, and terms of reference will ensure good governance and help prevent \nfraud and corruption. \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \nE. \n\nBackground \n\nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THROUGH THE FUEL SUBSIDY REDUCTION \nCOMPENSATION PROGRAM \n\n1. \nThe  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  outlines  the  need  for  increasing \ninvestments in rural infrastructure development to reduce poverty in the rural areas. In a broader \ncontext, MTDP envisages reorienting public expenditures from consumption subsidies to more \ntargeted  support  for  the  poor  and  near  poor.  At  the  end  of  2004,  the  Government  announced \nplans to increase fuel prices and use savings in fuel subsidies for poverty reduction programs \ncovering  the  areas  of  health,  education,  nutrition,  and  rural  infrastructure  development. \nPreparatory  activities  then  began  for  various  initiatives,  including  the  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent of the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM).  \n \nF. \n\nProgram Formulation \n\nThe  Program  formulation  spanned  a  period  of  6  months  (January\u2013June  2005).  Guided \n2. \nby  the  National  Planning  and  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  the  initial  preparation \ninvolved  developing  the  Program\u2019s  underlying  principles  and  basic  framework,  as  well  as \nassessing demand for rural infrastructure and implementation capacities. In the later stages, the \nfocus was mainly on defining the detailed program scope and implementation arrangements. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  of  Program  Framework.  The  regional  development  directorate  of  the \nBAPPENAS,  tasked  with  coordinating  and  implementing  roles  on  several  ongoing  and \ncompleted rural development projects, was a key player in developing the basic framework for \nsupporting rural infrastructure development. The preparation, largely utilizing the Government\u2019s \nown capacities, involved an extensive process of consultations with the implementing agencies \ninvolved in such successful community-driven development projects as ADB\u2019s Community and \nLocal  Government  Support  (CLGS)  program,  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan  Development  Project \n(KDP), and Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2019s Rural Area Infrastructure Development \nProject.  The  initiative  draws  upon  the  strengths  of  these  successful  programs  for  alleviating \npoverty  by  raising  rural  incomes,  strengthening  local  institutions,  and  promoting  good \ngovernance.  The  framework  for  the  support,  based  on  a  community-driven  development \napproach,  was  completed  in  February  2005.  The  framework\u2019s  approval  and  announcement  of \nthe 1 March 2005 fuel price increase marked the start of the more detailed stage of preparation. \n \nAssessment  of  Potential  Demand. The BAPPENAS-led team undertook an extensive \n4. \neffort  to  identify  infrastructure-deficient  villages.  Using  2003  data  from  the  village  potentials \nsurvey,1 the core design team used per capita availability of infrastructure and other indicators \nto identify villages that were deficient in the basic infrastructure. In total, about 28,000 villages \nwere identified as infrastructure deficient. The results also indicated a strong correlation of poor \nand remote villages with lack of basic infrastructure. The village potentials survey, however, only \nreports  on  the  presence  of  infrastructure  and  does  not  report  on  the  adequacy  or  condition of \nexisting infrastructure, which suggests that actual demand for rural infrastructure-related support \nmay be larger than reported by the analysis. \n \n5. \nAssessment  of  Implementation  Capacities.  As  part  of  the  Program  formulation,  the \ncore  design  team  also  undertook  to  assess  the  implementation  capacities  compared  to  those \n\n                                                 \n1  The  annual  survey  is  conducted  by  the  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  reports  key  information  for  every  village  in  the \ncountry. It reports key socioeconomic and poverty data as well as each village\u2019s available assets and resources. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nthat were required by the ongoing community-driven development projects and programs. The \nassessment determined that implementation on a vast scale required strengthening capacities \nin  social  and  technical  facilitation.  Capacities  in  weak  areas  have  been  reinforced  by  training \nand  redeploying  staff  resources  as  well  as  by  recruiting  consultants.  The  assessments  also \nidentified the traditional funds flow mechanisms as inadequate to ensure fast, direct, and simple \ndisbursements,  as  well  as  to  mitigate  risks  of  leakages  and  corruption.  Learning  from \nexperience  on  the  KDP,  CLGS,  and  other  successful  community-driven  development  projects, \nspecial  funds  flow  mechanisms  were  established  for  the  Program.  These  are  described  and \nanalyzed in Appendix 6. \n \n6. \nDevelopment of Detailed Program Scope and Implementation Arrangements. This \npreparatory stage, envisaged by the framework to take about 4 months, was undertaken by the \nMinistry of Public Works with the help of consultants in key areas and included (i) identifying the \ndetailed  scope,  (ii)  preparing  detailed  implementation  plans,  (iii)  formulating  and  establishing \ndetailed  implementation  arrangements,  (iv)  preparing  work  plans  and  a  budget,  and  (v) \npreparing detailed implementation and technical guidelines for the beneficiaries and the staff. \n \nG. \n\nProgram Coverage and Village Selection \n\n7. \nGiven funding constraints and limitations in implementation capacities, about 12,800 of \nthe 28,000 infrastructure-poor villages could be included in the 2005 phase. Distribution of the \nresources  between  the  districts  was  governed  by  objective  criteria  based  on  a  given  district\u2019s \ndevelopment status. The districts across the country were categorized into (i) less developed or \ndisadvantaged, (ii) better off, and (iii) kota (cities). Within each of these categories, the districts \nwere further subdivided into four subcategories based on development status and the economic \nand  fiscal  situation.  The  less  developed  or  disadvantaged  category  was  accorded  the  highest \npriority, and, depending on the subcategorization, within each of the districts, 40 to 55 villages \nwere selected for the 2005 phase. In the better off districts, the coverage ranged from 20 to 35 \nvillages per district and it was 5 to 20 villages in each of the city districts. \n \n8. \nWhile  the  2005  phase  covered  some  427  of  the  459  districts  in  the  country,  the \nproportion of infrastructure-deficient villages that have so far been selected for the Program is \nroughly  45%.  The  planned  coverage  for  the  2006  phase  is  about  11,000  villages,  including \n1,800 villages through the proposed Rural Infrastructure Support Project. \n \nH. \n\nProgram Approach and Scope \n\n9. \nSimilar  to  the  KDP  phases  I,  II  and  III,  the  CLGS  program,  and  the  Rural  Area \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,  the  Program  adopts  a  community-driven  development \napproach.  Similar  to  the  village  infrastructure  development  activities  in  these  projects,  the \nProgram  empowers  communities  to  prioritize  their  infrastructure  needs,  plan  and  design  the \ninfrastructure, undertake the implementation, and operate and maintain the infrastructure. \n \n10. \nThe  PKPS-BBM  comprises  two  subcomponents:  (i)  infrastructure  works  and  (ii) \nsafeguarding or management and coordination. Their 2005 budget allocations were $320 million \nand  $10  million,  respectively.  Like  the  KDP  and  other  similar  projects,  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment subcomponent includes providing block grants to the communities for addressing \npriority infrastructure needs from an open menu of access, social, and productive infrastructures. \nExperience  from  the  KDP  and  other  past  projects  suggests  that  the  typical  priorities  of  the \nvillage population include village roads, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation, \nmarkets,  rural  electrification,  and  small  fish  landing  facilities.  As  in  the  KDP,  each  village  is \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nentitled to a block grant of about $25,000, which could be used for one or more of the village\u2019s \ninfrastructure-related  priorities.  The  eligible  expenditures  under  the  block  grant  would  include \nmaterials, labor, and equipment rental. \n \nSimilar to the KDP and other similar projects, the infrastructure works are supported by \n11. \nclose  social  and  technical  facilitation.  The  implementation  follows  a  three-step  approach:  (i)  a \nsocialization,  mobilization,  and  capacity  building  stage;  (ii)  an  infrastructure  implementation \nstage;  and  (iii)  an  operation  and  maintenance  stage.  In  the  first  stage,  the  community \nimplementation organizations (CIOs) are facilitated in prioritizing the infrastructure needs, and in \nplanning  and  designing  the  infrastructure.  The  CIOs  elect  a  representative  body  to  represent \ntheir interests and act in their behalf. CIO members are trained in record keeping, construction \nand supervision, and operation and maintenance. \n \n12. \nIn the second stage, the communities, with technical facilitation from district-level public \nworks  services,  undertake  the  development  of  priority  infrastructure.  All  works  are  undertaken \nby the CIOs utilizing their own labor and local equipment and materials. The Program, like the \nKDP,  follows  the  approach  of  payment  based  on  plans  rather  than  actual  expenditures,  and \ndisburses  40%  of  the  block  grant  upon  approval  of  the  proposal  and  signing  of  the  contract \nbetween  the  CIO  and  the  district  government.  Disbursements  to  the  CIO  are  made  directly  to \nthe  CIO  account  by  the  treasury.  Disbursement  of  the  next  tranche  of  40%  is  contingent  on \nverifying  progress  of  at  least  36%  against  the  plans.  Similarly,  the  last  tranche  is  released  at \nverification of at least 72% progress. \n \n13. \nIn  the  third  stage,  communities,  with  social  and  technical  facilitation,  develop  and \nestablish the operating and maintenance mechanisms. In the process, the CIO either reconfirms \nthe existing representative committee or establishes a committee that is tasked with operation \nand  maintenance  responsibilities.  The  committee  and  the  CIO  are  trained  in  operating  and \nmaintaining the scheme, and user fee mechanisms are established, if needed. \n \n14. \nThe  PKPS-BBM  includes  a  provision  for  a  year-end  independent  assessment  of  the \ndesign\u2019s  soundness  and  effectiveness,  as  well  as  of  the  quality  of  the  project  outputs  and \nimpacts.  This  is  to  be  coordinated  by  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  People\u2019s  Welfare  and \nundertaken  by  universities  in  the  provinces  concerned.  The  assessment  will  look  for \nweaknesses  and  strengths  in  the  Program  and  identify  lessons  to  incorporate  into  the  2006 \nphase. \n \nI. \n\nImplementation Progress \n\n15. \nBased  on  past  experience  from  the  KDP  and  other  community-driven  development \nprojects, the Program included a pre-implementation phase that focused on ensuring that (i) the \nimplementation  arrangements  were  fully  in  place;  (ii)  the  comprehensive  implementation, \nfinancial  and  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  were  prepared  and  disseminated;  (iii)  the \nselection  of  villages  in  all  districts  was  completed;  (iv)  the  socialization  was  completed  at  the \ndistrict and subdistrict levels; and (v) the facilitators were recruited. \n \n16. \nAt the time of the parliament\u2019s approving the budget in June 2005 and of releasing the \nfunds  in  July  2005,  the  Program  was  in  a  high  state  of  readiness.  The  implementation \narrangements  were  already  in  place,  and  national,  provincial,  district,  and  subdistrict  staff  had \nthe \nalready  been \npre-implementation  activities,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  adopted  a  prudent  approach  to \nimplementation to allow for adequate preparation of communities and for learning from the initial \n\nimplementing  procedures.  Even  with  completion  of \n\ntrained \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nimplementation  experience.  The  focus  in  July\u2013August  was  to  socialize  the  Program  to  the \nselected villages and to kick off forming the CIOs. Disbursement of grants to CIOs only started \nin  September  2005.  As  of  mid-October  2005,  the  Program  had  initiated  activities  in  almost  all \n12,800  villages  and  had  mobilized  12,376  village  organizers.  CIOs  had  been  formed  in  over \n96% of the villages, while design and costing had been completed in about 91% and 82% of the \nvillages, respectively. Contracts between CIOs and the Program had been signed for 67% of the \nvillages, and 48% of the CIOs had already received the first tranche. In total, roughly $63 million \nhave  so  far  been  disbursed  to  CIOs.  The  initial  feedback  suggests  that  grant  utilization  within \ncommunities has been fast, and a sizable proportion of the communities are in the process of \nrequesting the second tranche. \n \nJ. \n\nADB\u2019s Assessment of the PKPS-BBM \n\n17. \nGiven that findings of the Government\u2019s planned assessment of the PKPS-BBM will not \nbe  available  until  early  2006,  the  Project  team  ndertook  preliminary  assessment  of  the \nimplementation  capacities,  financial  management  and  fiduciary  controls,  and  implementation \nprogress. In this regard, the loan fact-finding and appraisal missions held discussions with the \ncore program design team, core implementation team at the national level, consultants assisting \nin  the  implementation,  the  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  team,  and  communities  in \nEast Java and Benten provinces. In addition, the Project team also met with key people involved \nin  managing  other  ongoing  community-driven  development  projects  and  programs.  The \npotential number of villages that have not been assisted by the PKPS-BBM was assessed, and \nthis was found to far exceed the number of  villages that will be covered by the Project (Table \nA2.1). \n \n\nTable A2.1: PKPS-BBM 2005 Coverage and Potential Demand for 2006-2007 Phases \n\nNumber of \nLess \nDeveloped \nDistricts \n8 \n14 \n8 \n13 \n43 \n\nNumber of \nVillages \nUnserved by \nPKPS-BBM \n1,088 \n1,521 \n1,134 \n853 \n4,598 \n\nNumber of \nVillages Covered \nby 2005 PKPS-\nBBM \n427 \n811 \n340 \n466 \n2,044 \n\nNumber of \nVillages in Less \nDeveloped \nDistricts \nProvince \n1,515 \nEast Java \n2,332 \nNusa Tenggara East \n1,474 \nSouth East Sulawesi \n1,319 \nSouth Sulawesi \nOverall \n6,640 \nPKPS-BBM = Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program. \nSources: Decree of the State Minister of the Less Developed Regions, Number: 001/KEP/M-PDT/II/2005 of 7 \nFebruary 2005 and PKPS-BBM Reports. \n \n18. \nThe Project team\u2019s assessments indicate that the Program design is effective and cost \nefficient, and that it takes into account major lessons learned from the past and ongoing projects \nand  programs.  The  proposed  transaction  costs  were  found  to  be  either  lower  than  or \ncomparable to those for similar projects and programs. The funds flow mechanisms were found \nto  be  simple,  efficient,  and  effective  with  minimal  scope  for  leakages.  The  preliminary \nassessment identified some lessons from the initial implementation, which are listed in para. 15 \nof  the  main  text.  In  addition  to  the  preliminary  assessment  undertaken  by  the  Project  team, \ninformation for further improving the Program and the proposed Project\u2019s design will come from \nthe  year-end  independent  assessment  of  the  Project  design  effectiveness  and  from  the \nassessment of financial management systems and fiduciary controls at the inception stage. \n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL  \nINFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (1970\u20132005) \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\na. \nb. \n\na. \nb. \n\nSubtotal \n\nSubtotal \n\nSubtotal \n\nAmount  \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\na. \nb.

This  chapter  notes  the  welfare  of  these  areas  needs  greater \ngovernment concern for their development. These are areas (i) with limited access to transportation to connect them \nto more developed areas, (ii) lacking in human and natural resources, (iii) having low and scattered populations, and \n(iv)  not  having  been  given  priority  by  regional  government  because  they  are  not  deemed  as  having  revenue \ngenerating  potential.  These  are  areas  in  an  unequal  race,  lacking  institutional  infrastructure  to  support  sustainable \neconomic development, and underserved by public services. Rural infrastructure, access roads, fish landing sites, and \nimproved markets are all fundamental underpinnings for reducing rural poverty. \n \nThe Country Poverty Assessment and Poverty Partnership Agreement identify regional disparity and inadequate rural \ninfrastructure  as  key  poverty  reduction  issues.  In  addressing  regional  inequality,  the  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement \nspecifies  that  \u201cpro-poor  or  inclusive  growth  also  requires  improvement  in  regional  equity  through  balanced  regional \ndevelopment\u201d  and  \u201ctargeted  support  of  weaker  local  governments  is  required  to  prevent  worsening  of  regional \ninequity.\u201d  The  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  pledges  to  support  the  Government  in  achieving  good  growth  by \n\u201c...increasing  the  productivity  of  the  poor  through  empowerment  and  the  development  of  infrastructure  especially  in \nrural  and  remote  areas,\u2026\u201d  Community-driven  development  of  rural  infrastructure  is  the  type  of  activity  envisioned \nunder the partnership agreement. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                               \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  targeted  districts  belong  to  the  category  designated  by  the  Government  as  disadvantaged.  These  districts  are \npoor  in  terms  of  human  and  natural  resources,  with  limited  access  to  economic  centers  that  could  spur  their \ndevelopment, and require additional attention by the Government. Their common attributes are high levels of poverty, \nlow  participation  rates  in  school,  low  levels  of  education  in  the  working  age  population,  high  dependence  on \nagriculture, and low access to safe water. The proposed Project provides essential village infrastructure, selected and \ndeveloped  by  the  community  from  a  menu  of  infrastructure.  The  menu  ensures  that  the  infrastructure  contributes  to \npoverty  reduction  and  achievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  needs,  the  benefits  are  widely  captured,  and \nlocal  public  works  offices  have  the  capacity  to  provide  technical  support.  The  absence  of  village  infrastructure  is  a \nstrong correlate for poverty. A nonpoor household is 1.4 times more likely to be living in a village accessible by road \n12 months out of the year and 1.4 times more likely to be living in a village with electricity. The participatory process \nensures that within this menu, priorities of both the men and  women and poor and nonpoor are met and a sense of \nownership  is  developed.  The  community-as-contractor  approach  further  instills  ownership  and  transparency  and \nprovides opportunities for income generation in areas of high underemployment. \n \nSince  the  financial  crisis,  funds  for  infrastructure  development  have  been  limited  and  there  is  a  backlog  of  unmet \ndemand  for  upgrading  existing  village  infrastructure.  The  approach  builds  on  a  history  of  successful  community \nempowerment  and  development  projects  where  funds  are  channeled  directly  to  communities  for  their  planning  and \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nA community participation approach supported by trained facilitators will ensure perspectives of both men and women \n\nTargeting Classification:   Targeted Intervention \n\nX   Yes               \n\nx  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nare represented in planning, designing, and implementing the village infrastructure investments. Both perspectives are \nimportant  to  the  choice  and  siting  of  the  investment,  planning  and  implementing  construction,  and  agreeing  on \narrangements for use and maintenance. A minimum of 20% of the organizers will be women. This is commensurate \nwith participation of women in the labor force. The village representative committees will include at least one woman, \nand  committee  membership  will  be  at  least  20%  female.  Experience  from  the  CLGS  program  shows  the  number  of \nwomen on the committees tends to vary from few women to entirely women, depending on circumstances of individual \nvillages. Although it is difficult to measure participation of men and women in construction, some tasks tend to be done \nmore  by  women,  such  as  finishing  work  on  masonry  and  concrete,  ground  clearing  preparations,  spreading  gravel, \nleveling and filling work, and other tasks requiring attention to detail and manual dexterity. The types of infrastructure \nproposed present opportunities to provide temporary casual labor to both men and women. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE.

No negative impacts are expected. \nNo  displacement  of  labor  will  occur  as  a  result  of  the \nProject. Some income generating opportunities will accrue \nto  the  community  during  the  construction  period  for  both \nskilled  and  unskilled  labor.  Communities  will  plan  and \nagree on how these opportunities will be allocated. \n\nvillage  products  or  purchase \n\nform \n\nthe  basis \n\nThe Project area is ethically diverse. As communities are \ngenerally  ethnically  homogeneous  and  community  action \nplans \nfor  all  decision  making  and \nimplementation,  the  proposed  Project  design  creates  an \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan \nfor  every \ncommunity.  The  use  of  experienced  local  facilitators \nfurther  facilitates  accommodation  of  indigenous  people\u2019s \naspirations  and  priorities  into  these  plans.

Due  diligence  focused  on  (i)  the  institutional  framework \nin  which  the  project  is  to  be  implemented,  and  in  particular  on  assessing  the  financial \nmanagement  capacity  and  readiness  of  the  implementing  agency;  (ii)  the  adequacy  of  the \nimplementation arrangements that would ensure the ADB funds would be utilized effectively for \nthe intended purpose; and (iii) identifying additional levels of controls or procedures that could \nbe introduced for mitigating against any obvious weaknesses.  \n \nK. \n\nAssessment of the Executing Agency  \n\n2. \nThe  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  through  its  Directorate  General  of  Human \nSettlements  (DGHS)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The  Ministry  is  experienced  in \nexecuting community-driven infrastructure projects, and it is currently handling the PKPS-BBM \nproject.  The  Project  will  incorporate  specific  actions  to  ensure  implementation  of  measures \nagreed between the MPW (then the Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) and the \nADB  on  11  June  2004,  which  are  aimed  at  increasing  efficiency,  enhancing  quality  of  project \noutputs, and preventing fraud and corruption. The action plan is in Appendix 7, and its features \nappropriate to the Project design will be incorporated into the loan agreement.  \n \n3. \nNotwithstanding past experience and approval of the budget by the Parliament in June \n2005,  the  Ministry  has  launched  a  comprehensive  socialization  of  the  program  and  has  taken \nsteps to ensure effective preparedness with respect to the implementing structures, processes, \nand  guidelines.  Given  the  lead-time  required  for  these  activities,  the  PKPS-BBM,  which  was \napproved  by  the  Parliament  in  June  2005,  started  disbursing  funds  to  the  village  level  only  in \nSeptember 2005. Even prior to the approval by the Parliament, the Government, as part of its \nplanning  and  design  phase,  had  undertaken  a  series  of  steps  to  ensure  that  once  the  budget \nwas approved the funds could flow quickly. Some of the steps undertaken were as follow: \n\nThe MPW received funds amounting to Rp3.3 trillion for the PKPS-BBM for rural \nroad rehabilitation, clean water facility, and irrigation. These focus areas were not \nnew to the Ministry, as it had been focusing on them since 2001. \nUp  to  mid-March  2005,  the  MPW  established  coordinating  teams  and  launched \nsocialization activities for the provinces and the districts.  \nThe MPW produced comprehensive but easy to understand manuals delineating \nprocedures ranging from the technical to the fiduciary aspects of the PKPS-BBM \nsupport.  These  manual  have  been  disseminated.  The  manuals  with  respect  to \nthe fiduciary controls have been reviewed and found to be adequate in meeting \nthe  needs  of \nto \namendments, if necessary. \nFrom mid-March 2005 until mid-April 2005, the focus was on the socialization on \nthe Kecamatan (subdistrict) level. \nDuring  April  2005,  PKPS-BBM  facilitators  were  recruited  and  trained  on  the \nvarious PKPS-BBM implementing issues.  \nFrom  March  to  mid-May  2005,  the  MPW  conducted  a  selection  process  on  the \ndistricts,  including  their  profile  and  criteria  for  eligibility.  In  parallel,  during  May \n2005, the selected district proposed a list of villages, types of infrastructure to be \ndeveloped, and a training program for the technical facilitators.  \n\nimplementation.

An \ninitial review has shown that the first tranche disbursement to these villages went \nsmoothly,  as  has  the  utilization  of  the  funds,  and  the  Government  is  about  to \ndisburse the second tranche. \n\nAssessment of the Implementing arrangements \n\n4. \nThe fiduciary assessment of the implementing arrangements for the PKPS-BBM focused \non  critical  steps  in  the  implementation  process  to  determine  whether  the  arrangements \nincorporated  were  based  on  what  had  proven  successful  in  practice  in  previous  and  ongoing \nprograms  that  are  similar,  as  well  as  on  whether  improved  controls  had  been  incorporated  to \nmilitate against recognized weaknesses. It also looked to identify what additional controls could \nbe implemented by the ADB program either to militate against the weaknesses or to strengthen \nwhat had been incorporated in the PKPS-BBM arrangements.  \n \n5. \nImplicit in the above is the recognition that village administration is the most transparent \nand democratic in the country and the realization that there are many self-governing checks and \nbalances  at  the  village  level  to  militate  against  corruption.  With  respect  to  effective \nanticorruption measures, it is recognized that, as the project is a poverty reduction exercise, the \nmain thrust of the anticorruption agenda is to ensure that the beneficiaries directly receive the \nfunds  with  minimum  delay  and  that  no  leakages  occur  at  the  village  level.  Effective \nanticorruption measures need to focus on three broad principles: (i) elimination of hierarchy and \ncomplexity;  (ii)  transparency  at  all  levels,  and  particularly  at  the  transaction  level,  and  (iii)  an \neffective complaints mechanism.  \n \n6. \n \n\nThe assessment benchmarked the following critical steps: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPlanning.  So  that  the  village-level  assessments  are  prepared  in  a  transparent, \nconsistent,  and  cost-effective  manner,  with  the  villagers  clearly  aware  of  how \nmuch they were getting and for what. \nDisbursement  and  funds  flow  to  the  village.  So  that  the  funds  flow \nmechanisms to the village are smooth and transparent. \nUtilization  at  the  village  level.  So  that  the  utilization  at  the  village  level  is \nadequately controlled with regular, transparent record keeping and recording. \n\n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation. So that the monitoring and evaluation allows for an \nindependent assessment of the village investment outputs compared to the plan \nand overall program objectives. \n\n \n1. \n\nPlanning \n\n7. \nThe  villages  are  pre-selected  based  on  predetermined  poverty  criteria  that  utilize  data \nfrom the Central Statistics Agency. This is intended to provide objectivity in how the villages are \nchosen, reduce delays in selecting the villages, and allow some direct targeting of poor villages. \nThis  moves  away  from  the  competitive  selection  of  villages  as  was  used  under  the  earlier \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nKecamatan Development Project (KDP), thus eliminating the bureaucratic layer required for this \nstep in the process. \n \n8. \nVillagers\u2019  investment  decisions  are  taken  at  the  village  community  level.  Village  plans \nwill be very much driven by local community imperatives and will be quarantined from influence \nby district or provincial authorities. Even traditional village-level hierarchies are bypassed, as the \nvillage head is encouraged not to be part of the design or implementation teams, but rather to \ntake a quality assurance and external monitoring role. The planning procedures force the village \nplans to delineate clearly all aspect of the village investment costs in a predetermined format. In \nparticular,  where  local  villagers  themselves  will  be  employed  the  plan  must  indicate  the \nindividuals, the rates to be paid, and the length of time the individuals will be employed. Every \nvillage-level  plan  must  be  countersigned  by  the  village  team,  an  independent  member  of  the \nvillage,  and  the  village  organizer  prior  to  submitting  the  plan  for  funds  release.  The  villages \ndecide  where  to  spend  the  money  from  an  existing  menu  of  options  provided  by  the  project \nguidelines.  As  mentioned  above,  these  guidelines  have  already  been  socialized  and \ndisseminated. The role of the district-level project manager is mainly to ensure that a plan has \nbeen produced and implemented according to the guidelines. \n \n9. \nSimplified  procurement  practices  focus  on  the  community  level.  It  is  noted  that  a  large \nportion  of  the  funds  are  allocated  for  block  grants  to  the  villages.  Communities  are  not  only \nallowed to plan the programs, but they must also implement them. It is up to the community to \nconclude  as  to  whether  the  activities  can  be  carried  out  by  the  community  itself  or  whether  it \nneeds  to  be  contracted  out  to  external  consultants.  In  that  way,  the  community  will  take  into \nconsideration  issues  such  as  lack  of  technology,  manpower,  or  equipment.  Villagers  will  be \nallowed  to  procure  goods  and  services  based  on  local  economic  factors  and  need  not  be \ninfluenced by Government pricing procedures or the urban market economy. To further ensure \nthat it will impact on poverty alleviation, the Project will be focused mainly on reconstruction and \nrehabilitation  in  specific  areas  rather  than  on  new  infrastructure  construction.  This  will \nsignificantly reduce the need for external contractors. Employment generation is encouraged, as \nit is recognized that villagers themselves will undertake many of these activities using their own \nlabor.  The  Project  allows  for  a  greater  degree  of  additional  technical  support  in  the  earlier \nstages for project design and supervision. \n \n2. \n\nDisbursement and Funds Flow \n\n10. \nDisbursement  per  Village.  The  project  allows  for  a  fixed  amount  per  village  that  is \nstandardized and widely publicized so that all stakeholders know how much the village will be \ngetting. As mentioned above, funds are disbursed upon completion of an approved plan that is \nformulated  by  a  village.  Disbursements  will  be  in  tranches,  with  each  tranche  representing  a \nfixed  percentage  of  the  total  allocated  per  village.  Tranche  release  conditions  have  been \npublicized  in  a  clear  regulation  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (Treasury  regulation  No. \n02/PB/2005).  They  are  clearly  delineated  in  the  procedures,  socialized,  standardized,  and  not \nonerous. The releases to the village are as follow: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFirst  tranche.  Representing  40%  of  the  fixed  amount.  Released  following \nsubmission of the village\u2019s physical and funds utilization plan. \nSecond  tranche.  Representing  40%  of  the  fixed  amount.  Released  when  the \nimplementation  progress,  in  terms  of  value,  has  reached  a  minimum  of  36% \ncompletion.  This  is  based  on  a  progress  report  approved  by  the  village  and \ninclude  detailed  supporting \nreviewed  by \n\nthe  district.  This  report  would \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n41 \n\n(iii) \n\ndocumentation and reports on the funds utilization\u2014including any revisions to the \noriginal plans. \nThird  tranche. Representing the final 20% of the fixed amount. Released if the \nprogress has reached a minimum of 72% completion, as agreed by the district-\nlevel project implementation unit, plus with the provision of additional information \nas for the second tranche.  \n\n \n11. \nFunds  Flow  to  the  Village.  Project-specific project funds will be created at the central \nlevel  to  receive  project  funds.  For  the  Project  there  will  be  a  project-specific  special  account \nopened in the Bank Indonesia to receive funds from ADB. Approved withdrawals from the latter \nwill be the basis of replenishment from ADB. Once plans are approved, funds will flow directly \nfrom the special account to the village bank accounts, i.e., there will be no intermediary account \nbetween the special account and the village bank account. This will minimize any rent-seeking \nfor the release of project funds that can happen if funds are transferred through a hierarchy. The \noverall schematic of the funds flow is delineated in Appendix 14. \n \n3. \n\nUtilization at the Village Level \n\n12. \nFunds Withdrawal from the Village Bank Account. The village cannot withdraw funds \nwithout  countersigning  by  two  pre-appointed  individuals  whose  names  have  already  been \nsubmitted to the local bank. The openings of the bank accounts have been simplified. \n \n13. \nRecord  Keeping  and  Transparency  of  Reports.  Every item of expenditure has to be \naccounted for on detailed but simple expense reports. Training is provided to ensure sufficient \nsupporting documentation is maintained for the audit. The Project has incorporated many of the \nfeatures of the World Bank\u2019s KDP project with regard to the transparency of records and reports \nat  the  village  level.  The  Project  will  undertake  a  media  campaign  in  the  selected  villages, \nsubdistricts, and districts to ensure adequate awareness of project approach and interventions. \nAt  the  village  level,  the  communities  will  make  available  their  plans,  budgets,  and  financial \nrecords to the public. A summary of the plans, progress reports, and financial records will also \nbe  posted  on  signboards  within  the  village.  The  Project  will  also  enable  flow  of  information  to \ncommunities  by  requiring  the  districts  and  subdistricts  to  provide  copies  of  the  quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  the  communities.  This  will  help  in  cross-checking  the  accuracy  and \ncompleteness of reports. At the Project level, the Government and ADB will disclose the Project-\nrelated information in accordance with ADB\u2019s public communication policy.1 \n \n4. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation  \n\n14. \nOverall  Program  Monitoring  of  PKPS-BBM.  The  Government  has  set  up  a \ncoordinating  team  consisting  of  the  ministries  of  public  works,  finance,  agriculture,  and \nmanpower,  as  well  as  other  related  institutions.  The  team  will  coordinate  task  forces  at  a \nregional level. The Government has clearly stated that, given that a large bulk of the monitoring \nfunds will go directly to the regional governments, it would impose strict sanctions if the funds \ndid not reach their targets. The Government has encouraged nongovernment organizations and \nother external parties to comment on any stage of the program implementation.  \n \n15. \nExtensive Use of Facilitators. Facilitators are provided at the districts, subdistricts, and \nvillages  to  assist  in  technical  planning  and  implementation.  In  addition,  these  facilitators  will \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. The Public Communications Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nmonitor the quality assurance of the village investment outputs, which will be incorporated in the \nreports at each tranche release stage as well as overall. \n \n16. \nAudits.  There  will  be  extensive  use  of  internal  auditors  as  part  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  At  the  village  level,  the  target  is  to  have  80%  of  villages  audited  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s  internal  auditors.  In  that  respect,  the  executing  agency  has  incorporated  the \nrecommendations of the ADB technical assistance that produced a Ministry of Settlements and \nRegional  Infrastructure  action  plan.  That  plan  encourages  use  of  the  inspector  general  in \nmonitoring and evaluating projects. In addition, external audits of the overall PKPS-BBM by the \nsupreme  audit  institution  will  be  undertaken.  The  Project  itself  has  allocated  funds  to \nsupplement  the  existing  audit  by  the  supreme  auditor  institution  that  will  allow  for  spot  audits \nwhere necessary for specific concerns. \n \n17. \nEffective Complaints  Mechanism. In the implementing guidelines for the PKPS-BBM, \npublic  complaints  mechanisms  are  detailed  at  length.  Public  complaints  are  part  of  the \nsupervision  encouraged  by  the  public,  including  nongovernment  organizations,  community \ngroups, religious groups, universities, and journalists. \n \n18. \nComplaints may be made through (i) the public complaints unit; (ii) a post box provided \nby  the  village  representative  committee;  (iii)  a  letter  directly  to  the  village  head,  public  forum, \nand  the  village  working  group;  and  (iv)  a  letter  directly  to  the  related  government  units  from \nsubdistrict level up to the central level of Government. \n \n19. \nComplaints  will  be  divided  into  the  categories  (i)  deviation  from  the  principles  and \nprocedures, (ii) deviation from approved funds usage, (iii) interventions that harm the project, (iv) \nforce  majeur  events,  and  (v)  other  matters.  Complaints  will  be  resolved  transparently  and  by \nprinciples of participation. In this regard, public participation will be encouraged and supported \nby  the  facilitator.  Complaints  will  be  monitored  and  reported  in  the  monthly  report  and  will  be \nfollowed by further investigation, if required. \n \nC. \n \nThe  Project  provides  for  8%  of  project  funds  to  be  utilized  for  activities  other  than  the \n20. \nblock  grants.  This  is  double  the  current  4%  being  proposed  by  the  Government  for  the \nPKPS-BBM.  In  terms  of  specific  activities,  the  Project  recognizes  that  the  Government  has \ndrawn on best practices from ongoing and past programs and hence the focus of the additional \nfunds is to provide a greater degree and depth of the existing monitoring and evaluation rather \nthan to suggest additional monitoring and evaluation steps. There is obviously a need to avoid \nexcessive  regulation  but  also  to  have  effective  regulation.  The  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  plan  is  more  likely  to  err  on  the  conservative  side,  as  it  allows  for  this  greater \ndegree  of  scrutiny  at  each  level.  Hence,  there  will  be  more  technical  facilitators  and  financial \nmanagement facilitators at the local level, along with spot audits.  \n \n21.  More  importantly,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  an  evaluation  of  the  Government \nPKPS-BBM early in 2006 so that deficiencies and weaknesses can be addressed. The Project \nwill conduct an in-depth analysis of the financial procedures and processes, taking into account \nthe  actual  experiences  of  the  PKPK-BBM  exercise.  If  additional  levels  of  control  are  required, \nthen  the  Government  has  agreed  to  accept  that  as  part  of  the  Project.  In  addition,  it  would \nconsider  implementing  the  recommendations  in  the  next  tranche  release  of  the  Government\u2019s \nown funds.  \n \n\n Additional Monitoring and Evaluation Provided within the Project \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n43 \n\nConclusions \n\nD. \n \n22. \nThe  PKPS-BBM  was  found  to  be  well  designed,  ably  administered,  and  with  sound \nfinancial  management  systems  and  fiduciary  controls.  The  Mission  incorporated  additional \nfeatures and mechanisms into the Project design, where deemed necessary. The Government \nagreed  to  undertake  further  assessments  to  ascertain  the  development  effectiveness  of  the \nPKPS-BBM  and the adequacy of its financial management systems at the completion of 2005 \nactivities.  Lessons  learned  will  be  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  PKPS-BBM  and  of  the \nProject. \n \n\n \n\n\fFIDUCIARY CONTROL, FRAUD, AND ANTICORRUPTION ACTION PLAN \n \nAction \n\nIssue \n\nNo \n\n44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n1.

No environmental impact analysis or initial environmental examination is required, \nbut  evaluating  environmental  implications  of  the  specific  schemes  under  the  Project  will  be \nrequired.  The  infrastructure  schemes  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  will  be  selected  during \nimplementation.  This  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  used  for \nscreening  the  schemes  so  that  those  selected  meet  category  C  requirements  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  similar  environmental  management  requirements.  If  screening  identifies  any \nschemes  requiring  any  additional  environmental  procedural  requirements  under  ADB  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and policies, then those schemes will not be selected under the Project. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  will  support  the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  small-scale  village \n2. \ninfrastructure  through  a  community-driven  development  approach,  using  a  block  grant  of \n$25,000  equivalent  to  each  village.  The  infrastructure  may  include  village  roads,  bridges  and \nculverts, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation schemes, and drainage works. \nThe activities will be undertaken by communities, largely through manual labor and using locally \navailable  materials.  The  activities  will  be  small  and  in  general  will  lead  to  improvements  in \npeople\u2019s  welfare,  sustainable  use  of  resources,  and  improved  hygiene.  These  will  result  in \nenvironmental  improvements.  Given  the  small  size  of  the  interventions  and  provision  of  close \ntechnical and social facilitation to communities, potential negative environmental impacts will be \nminimal  and  can  be  readily  mitigated.  Nonetheless,  schemes  will  be  screened  through  a \nframework with appropriate checklists to ensure that there are no negative impacts. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nIndonesia  has  its  own  environmental  impact  management  system  for  development \nprojects,  Analisis  Mangenai  Dampak  Lingkungan  Hidup,  which  specifies  procedural  steps  and \nrequired  mitigation  measures.  According  to  that  system\u2019s  criteria,  the  overall  Project  does  not \nrequire environmental assessment, but each individual scheme would need to be screened. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nBefore  they  are  approved  for  project  financing,  all  schemes  will  be  reviewed  by  the \nproject  implementation  unit  at  district  level  for  their  feasibility,  technical  soundness,  and \ncompliance with environmental guidelines. Based on the screening processes (Supplementary \nAppendix C), those schemes will be selected that are deemed to have minimal environmental \nimpact  and  demonstrate  \u201cequivalence\u201d  between  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nrequirements.  The  Project  provides  for  24  person-months  of  environmental  safeguard \nspecialists. The consultants will train the provincial, district, and subdistrict staff in screening for \nenvironmental  impacts  and  will  undertake  spot-checks  on  a  sample  of  schemes  to  verify  the \nthoroughness  and  accuracy  of  the  screening  process.  The  Project  staff  and  consultants  will \nfacilitate the village implementation organizations to evaluate the proposed schemes and their \ndesigns  using  the  checklists,  existing  government  guidelines,  and  the  screening  criteria \nthe \nthis  evaluation,  any  schemes \nindicated  above.  Based  on \naforementioned screening criteria will not be included in the Project. These evaluations will be \ncrosschecked by district-level officials for adherence to the stated criteria. \n\nEnvironmental Screening Process and Implementation Arrangements \n\nCountry\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure \n\nthat  would  not  meet \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nSUMMARY OF PROJECT COSTS \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nForeign \nExchangea \n\n0.00 \n8.81 \n8.81 \n \n \n\n0.50 \n53.38 \n53.88 \n \n \n\n0.50 \n44.57 \n45.07 \n \n \n\n1.

As \nvillage  investments  will  follow  a  community-based  approach,  designs  and  costs  of  selected \ninterventions will be determined during implementation. Quantifiable benefits will arise from village \nrural  investments  as  increased  rural  incomes  and  welfare,  but,  because  beneficiaries  determine \ninvestments,  the  Project\u2019s  actual  inputs  and  outputs  cannot  be  predicted  up  front.  The  Project, \ntherefore, does not lend itself to a traditional economic analysis. \n \nB. \n\nLikely Benefits and Impacts of Rural Infrastructure \n\n2. \nRural  Infrastructure  Benefits. The more common benefits expected to accrue include (i) \ntime  savings  in  collecting  water  and  cost  savings  in  obtaining  water;  (ii)  emergence  of  new \nbusinesses due to access to a water supply; (iii) time and cost savings due to faster transportation, \nincluding  more  efficient  transportation  of  goods  to  market;  (iv)  increase  in  the  value  of  land \nadjacent  to a  new  road;  (v)  new  employment  in  the  transport  sector;  (vi)  increase  in  the  value of \nagricultural land serviced by new irrigation works; (vii) increase in incomes due to better harvests \nresulting from reliable water supply; (viii) savings from potential damage to buildings and crops due \nto reduced flooding and improved irrigation, and (ix) creation of new businesses (roads). \n \n3. \nEmployment  Generation.  The  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Fuel  Subsidy  Reduction \nCompensation Program (PKPS-BBM) currently under implementation estimates that 30% to 50% \nof the total civil works inputs will consist of labor. Using a conservative estimate of 30% of village \ngrant  utilization,  the  Project  is  anticipated  to  generate  an  average  of  100  person/months  of \nemployment per village, or about a total 180,000 person/months. With an average labor wage of $3 \nper  day,  the  short-term  employment  income  generated  by  the  Project  is  anticipated  to  be  about \n$14 million. \n \n4. \nPoverty  Reduction  Impact. Infrastructure investments can also have a significant impact \non poverty reduction, although their abilities to reduce poverty varies. This is greater where poverty \nis most widespread and with better poverty targeting of projects.36 A number of case studies and \nevaluations  have  confirmed  that  infrastructure  development  reduces  rural  poverty  through  many \nchannels, such as improved growth in agricultural production, greater rural nonfarm employment, \nand  migration.  Nevertheless,  there  may  be  time  lags  between  the  investment  in  improved \ninfrastructure  and  the  positive  impacts.37 Evidence  from  studies  has  shown  that  rural  transport \nimprovements, in particular, and which are usually the types of intervention most demanded by the \ncommunities,  do  (i)  contribute  to  decreasing  the  costs  to  the  poor  for  personal  travel  and  goods \ntransport; (ii) increase the range of opportunities for wage employment (thereby raising the price of \nlabor  in  rural  areas);  and  (iii)  increase  empowerment  of  the  poor  and  their  participation  in  local \norganizations,  activities  outside \nlocal  political  processes  and \nthe  rural  community,  and \nmanagement structures.38  \n \n                                                 \n36 Cook, C. 2004.

In  addition  to  the  direct  and  indirect  yields  from  the  rural  infrastructure \ninvestments,  the  Project  is  expected  to  provide  benefits  through  the  technical  assistance  to \ncommunities  and  districts  in  designing  and  implementing  infrastructure  works,  as  well  as  the \ntraining  of  government  staff.  These,  however,  are  Project  activities  for  which  input  costs  are \nidentifiable but benefits and outputs cannot be predicted with accuracy. \n \nC. \n\nEvidence from Two Post-Evaluation Studies \n\n6. \nThe existence and significance of the economic benefits of rural infrastructure investments \nthat are expected to derive from the Project, overall and by type of intervention, are confirmed by \nextensive  experience  in  Indonesia.  In  particular,  the  conclusions  of  two  very  recent  ex-post \nevaluations\u2014one  of  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  one  of  two  World  Bank  funded \nprojects\u2014verified  very  significant  benefits  from  similar  community-based  interventions. 39  The \nbenefits were observed in terms of economic returns, cost effectiveness, quality of life, and income \nmultipliers.  The  results  of  these  evaluations  are  particularly  relevant  to  the  interventions  planned \nunder  the  Project,  due  to  similarities  in  the  approach  to  service  delivery,  types  of  infrastructure \nlikely to be involved, and grant sizes. \n \n\n1. \n\nADB  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector  Development \nProgram \n\nEconomic  and  Poverty  Reduction  Impact.  The  2005  independent  evaluation  of  the \n7. \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  and  ADB\u2019s  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  did  not  undertake  a  quantitative  analysis  of  the  impact  of  that  project.40 \nHowever,  the  qualitative  evaluation  confirmed  that  rural  infrastructure  investments  had  a  positive \nimpact on poverty reduction, stimulated village economic activities, and represented an important \nsource of primary and secondary employment that generated additional disposable income for the \nvillagers. The positive impact and benefits were greater in the cases of those interventions decided \nupon  and  implemented  at  the  village  level  and  by  the  communities  themselves  as  compared  to \ninterventions where district authorities were responsible for the use of the funds.  \n \n8. \nEmployment Generation. Overall, a total of 11,341,000 person-days of employment were \ngenerated  for  a  total  of  378,000  participants.  On  average,  this  meant  that  over  the  course  of  the \nproject a total of 37 person/months of employment for 31 individuals were created in each of the \nparticipating villages.  \n \n9. \nQuality  of  Life.  The  study  noted  a  high  level  of  satisfaction  among  the  communities \nreceiving  rural  infrastructure  interventions  and  enthusiastic  support  from  the  participants. \nSatisfaction  and  achievement  of  project  objectives  were  greater  in  the  cases  of  investments \nimplemented in a village-driven approach. \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n39 ADB.

Both  the  KDP  and  PKPS-BBM  follow  a  community-driven  development  approach  that \nemploys  social  facilitation  to  empower  the  communities  to  prioritize,  plan,  and  propose  the \ninfrastructure  development  to  meet  their  priority  needs.  Both  the  KDP  and  PKPS-BBM  allow  for \nmultiple  infrastructure  schemes  in  individual  villages,  with  an  average  of  about  two  schemes  per \nvillage.  Based  on  the  approved  plans,  block  grants  are  transferred  directly  to  the  community \norganizations\u2019  bank  accounts.  These  funds  cover  construction  costs  related  to  materials, \nequipment, and labor. Unlike the PKPS-BBM, the grant size in the KDP is not fixed. However, the \nfindings from evaluating the KDP phases I and II indicate that average grant size of about $24,000 \nper  village  is  similar  to  the  grant  size  under  the  PKPS-BBM.  In  addition  to  the  types  of \ninfrastructure eligible under the PKPS-BBM, the KDP also allows for health- and education-related \ninfrastructure. Grant utilization for these additional purposes, however, has been less than 2% of \nthe  total.  The  construction  activities  under  both  the  PKPS-BBM  and  KDP  follow  a  community-led \napproach where the use of local labor, materials, and equipment is encouraged. \n \n11. \nThe  findings  from  the  KDP  implementation  show  that  project  has  been  successful. \nInvestments in rural infrastructure development have been economically and financially viable and \nsustainable. Given that the PKPS-BBM follows a similar community-led implementation approach, \nsupports similar types and size of infrastructure, and invests similar amounts, the returns from the \nPKPS-BBM are anticipated to be similar in size and nature. \n \n12. \nEconomic  Benefits.  Commissioned  in  2005  by  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  World \nBank,  an  independent  post-construction  analysis  of  113  rural  infrastructure  subprojects  funded \nunder the KDP confirmed significant economic benefits accruing to villages that planned and built \ninfrastructure  facilities  following  a  community-based  approach. 41  The  average  cost  net  of \ncommunity contribution for these subprojects was about $12,000. Given that under the KDP each \nvillage  typically  received  support  for  two  infrastructure  subprojects,  the  average  support  for  each \nvillage amounted to $24,000, which is similar to the grant size under the proposed Project. In this \ncase, too, the villages have the option for undertaking works on more than one unit of infrastructure.  \n \nThe  study  calculated  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  four  types  of \n13. \ninfrastructures:  (i)  roads,  (ii)  bridges,  (iii)  water  supply,  and  (iv)  irrigation.  The  four  types  were \nchosen  because  they  have  been  shown  over  time  to  be  the  dominant  types  of  infrastructures \nrequested by the villages (representing more than two thirds of the total investments). The overall \nweighted-average  EIRR  for  all  113  projects  was  51.4%.  Table  A15.1  shows  how  average  EIRRs \nfor each type of infrastructure ranged in the various project provinces: \n \n\nTable A15.1: Economic Internal Rates of Return \n\nType of Infrastructure \n\nWater Supply \nRoads/Bridges \nIrrigation \n\nTotal  \n\nNumber of  \nProjects \n41 \n55 \n17 \n113 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nRange of Average EIRR in the \nVarious Project Provinces (%) \n28.4\u201336.4 \n33.3\u201347.4 \n66.3\u201385.1 \n51.4 \n\nSource: Economic Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program Infrastructure Project. \n\n                                                 \n41 Torrens,  Anthony.  2005.

The field survey carried out by the study concluded that of the 113 projects \n14. \nreviewed, 95% (108) were valued by the villagers as having a \u201cstrongly felt\u201d or \u201cfelt\u201d impact on the \nquality  of  life  of  the  supported  villages.  This  shows  a  high  level  of  direct  and  indirect  benefits \naccruing from the investments. \n \n15. \nCost-Effectiveness.  The  cost-effectiveness  analysis  carried  out  by  the  same  study \nreported that village infrastructure built through a community-based approach cost on average 56% \nless  than  equivalent  works  built  through  Ministry  of  Public  Works  or  local  government  contracts, \ndemonstrating  significant  cost  savings  and  additional  economic  value.  The  technical  quality  and \nproject  management  of  94%  of  the  113  projects  reviewed  was  evaluated  by  the  villagers \ninterviewed as very good or good. \n \nEmployment  Generation.  The  total  workdays  generated  from  all  the  KDP  infrastructure \n16. \nprojects  totaled  37  million  for  a  total  of  28,000  villages.  Thus,  on  average,  employment  of  53 \nperson/months was created in each of the participating villages over the course of the project.  \n \nGeneral  Income  Multiplier.  A  general  income  multiplier  analysis  was  also  undertaken. \n17. \nThis  estimated  the  disposable  incomes  and  spending  patterns  of  key  groups  within  the \ncommunities to assess the impact of the funds spent by the projects as they circulated within the \nvillage  economies.  The  study  for  the  Government  of  Indonesia  and  World  Bank  shows  that  the \ncash injected by the 113 projects into the village economies generated significant additional value, \nwith  an  average  multiplier  for  the  113  projects  of  1.165.  The  multipliers  in  the  various  project \nprovinces are presented by type of intervention in Table A15.2.  \n \n\nTable A15.2: General Project Income Multiplier \n\nType of  \nInfrastructure \nWater Supply \nRoads/Bridges \nIrrigation \nAll interventions \n\nRange of General Income Multiplier in \nthe Various Project Provinces \n1.063\u20131.297 \n1.085\u20131.320 \n1.146\u20131.252 \n1.165 \n\nSource: Economic Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program Infrastructure Project. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2005) \n", "Currency Unit \nRp1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.0001 \nRp10,000 \n", "ADB \nADF \nBAPPENAS  \n", "BPS \nCIO \nDGHS \nEIRR \nGDP \nIRIP \nKDP \nMDG \nMOU \nMPW \nMTDP \nNSC \nO&M \nPCMU \nPIU \nPKPS-BBM \n", "PPMS \nPRSP \nTA \n \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAsian Development Fund \nBadan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (National \nPlanning and Development Agency) \nBadan Pusat Statistik (Central Bureau of Statistics) \nCommunity implementation organization \nDirectorate General of Human Settlements \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and improvement plan \nKecamatan Development Project \nMillennium Development Goal \nmemorandum of understanding \nMinistry of Public Works  \nMedium Term Development Plan \nNational Steering Committee \noperation and maintenance \nproject coordination and monitoring unit \nProject Implementation Unit \nProgram Kompensasi Pengurangan Subsidi Bahan Bakar \nMinyak (Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program) \nproject performance management system \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper \ntechnical assistance \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", "J.
