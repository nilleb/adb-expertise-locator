The population of the Kathmandu Valley was 2.51 million in 2011, and is \ngrowing at a high rate of 4.3% per annum, while Nepal\u2019s total population is growing at 1.4% per \nannum.3  Rapid  and  unplanned  urban  growth  and  inadequate  investments  in  wastewater \nmanagement  have  resulted  in  poor  quality  wastewater  services  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  The \ndisposal  of  untreated  sewage  in  rivers  affects  the  quality  of  surface  and  ground  water  and \nincreases disease incidence, health risks, and associated economic burdens,4 particularly for the \npoor and socially excluded groups, notably women. The focus on wastewater complements and \nbuilds on past and ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects in water supply. Since 2000, \nADB  has  been  working  with  the  government  in  urban  water  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  in \ndeveloping water sources and treatment plants, improving transmission and distribution networks, \nand undertaking institutional reforms.5 The 27.5-kilometer Melamchi tunnel is a key component of \nthe water supply system. It will significantly increase water volumes through transfer of water from \nthe Melamchi River to the Kathmandu Valley, and its performance impacts the pace and progress \nof  downstream  urban  projects  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  Further,  as  part  of  the  institutional \nreforms, three water and wastewater organizations were created in 2008\u2015the Kathmandu Valley \nWater  Supply  Management  Board  (KVWSMB),  the  asset  owner;  Kathmandu  Upatyaka \nKhanepani Limited (KUKL), the asset operator and service provider; and the Water Supply Tariff \nFixation Commission (WSTFC), the regulator. These organizations are still in the process of fully \noperationalizing their mandates in an effective and efficient manner.  \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed \nLoan to Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Improvement Project (Loan 2776-NEP[SF], approved on 16 \nSeptember 2011, effective on 7 February 2012). The closing date of Loan 1820-NEP was 31 March 2007, and was \nextended to 31 December 2013. Loan 2058-NEP(SF) was closed on 31 December 2008. The closing date of Loan \n2059-NEP[SF] was 30 June 2011 and was extended to 31 December 2014. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n4. \nFocus  on  capacity  building  and  service  delivery.  The  project  will  strengthen  KUKL, \nKVWSMB, and WSTFC to increase operational efficiency and improve service delivery, and  will \nresult  in  positive  impacts  on  health  and  quality  of  life  for  Kathmandu  Valley  residents. With  the \ncompletion of the ongoing projects (footnote 5), the Kathmandu Valley will receive an additional \n170 million liters per day (MLD) of water in 2016 (the current average availability of water is only \n100  MLD6).  The  sewerage  system,  which  is  inadequate  even  to  manage  existing  low  levels  of \nwater supply, will be further overburdened by more than 125 MLD of additional wastewater.7 Of \nfive  existing  WWTPs,  only  one,  which  has  a  capacity  of  16.4  MLD,  is  based  on  a  mechanized \ntreatment  process;  the  rest  are  waste  stabilization  pond  systems.  All  of  the  WWTPs  are \nnonfunctional  or  only  partially  functional,  and  require  investments  for  upgrade  and  renovation. \nThe project aims to use energy efficient and mechanized processes to treat approximately 45% of \nwastewater generated in the Kathmandu Valley in 2018 (treatment capacity of 90.5 MLD against \n200.0 MLD wastewater generated) in accordance with the long-term capital investment and asset \nmanagement program, approved by the government for prioritized year-wise investments in water \nsupply  and  wastewater  infrastructure  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley.8  The  project  will  help  to  reduce \npollution  of  the  Bagmati  River9  in  accordance  with  the  Bagmati  Action  Plan,10  and  will \ncomplement  efforts  at  further  improving  river  basin  management  under  the  proposed  Bagmati \nRiver Basin Improvement Project.11  \n \n5. \nDevelopment  partnerships.  The  efforts  of  the  government  and  various  development \npartners to improve urban services in the Kathmandu Valley have started to achieve the desired \nresults.12  Progress  on  the  Melamchi  tunnel  has  been  improving  despite  frequent  political \ndisturbances, institutional weaknesses, and poorly performing contractors, and the tunnel is likely \nto be completed in 2016. The ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project (footnote 5) was adversely \naffected from 2000 to 2006 when several development partners withdrew because of the volatile \nsociopolitical  situation  and internal  conflict  in  the country  at  the time.  Investments  in the  project \nare necessary and timely to fully leverage the benefits of ongoing projects. \n \n6. \nLessons. The project was developed using lessons from previous ADB interventions and \nthe country assistance program evaluation, which pointed to the need for strategic, well-defined, \nand prioritized urban infrastructure investments.13  The implementation arrangements have been \nkept simple with a focus on using the institutional arrangements created under previous projects \nto ensure continued capacity building and sustainability. An important lesson from earlier projects \nis  that  stronger  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  the  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  existing \ninfrastructure  in  parallel  with  the  creation  of  new  assets.  Accordingly,  the  project  will  focus  on \nimproving  the  existing  sewerage  network  and  WWTPs.  Another  lesson  is  that  stakeholders \nshould  be  involved  from  the  early  stage  of  project  development;  the  project  has  provided \nadequate resources for participation of various stakeholders. Further, civil works packages have \nbeen kept sufficiently large to attract qualified international bidders. \n                                                \n6   Though the current average availability of water through KUKL is estimated at 100 MLD, availability varies widely \n\nand ranges from 70 MLD in the dry season to 140 MLD in the wet season.  \n\n7   There is no accurate assessment of the volume of wastewater generated. Estimating from water supply data from \nboth KUKL and private sources, average current wastewater generation is assessed as 75 MLD, and an additional \n125 MLD of wastewater is expected with the completion of the Melamchi tunnel.  \n\n8   The Capital Investment and Asset Management Program 2010\u20132025 was prepared with ADB assistance in 2010. \n9   The Bagmati River is considered a holy river by Hindus and Buddhists. Several Hindu temples are located on its \n\nbanks. \n\n10   The Bagmati Action Plan (2009\u20132014) was adopted by the government in August 2009 and is being implemented \nby the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC). Zone 4 of this \nplan  focuses  on  the  urban  area  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley  and  the  components  proposed  in  the  project  are \nconsistent with the plan. \n\n11   The project is being prepared through PPTA 8050-NEP: Preparing the Bagmati River Basin Improvement Project. \n12   Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13   ADB. 2009. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Nepal. Manila. \n\n\f \nContext  in  country  programming.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Nepal  country \n7. \npartnership  strategy,14  which  aims  to  support  Nepal\u2019s  peace  and  development  aspirations  by \npromoting the following four pillars: (i) broad-based and inclusive economic growth, (ii) inclusive \nsocial  development,  (iii)  governance  and  capacity  building,  and  (iv)  climate  change  adaptation \nand environmental sustainability. The project fits into the priority water supply and other municipal \ninfrastructure and services sector, identified in the country partnership strategy, and will support \nthe country\u2019s peace and development through improved access to basic services. The project is \nincluded in the Nepal country operations business plan.15   \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  impact  will  be  sustainable  wastewater  management  for  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  The \noutcome  will  be  improved  access  to,  and efficiency  of,  wastewater  services  for  the  residents  of \nthe  Kathmandu  Valley.  The  project  will  further  consolidate  the  continuing  efforts  of  the \ngovernment and ADB in institutional development and improved governance of wastewater.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nThe  project  will  broadly  follow  the  priorities  identified  in  the  Conceptual  Wastewater \nMasterplan,16 capital investment and asset management program (footnote 8), and the Bagmati \nAction Plan, and will be implemented in coordination with the Bagmati River Basin Improvement \nProject (footnote 11). The project outputs will be as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput  1:  Sewerage  network  rehabilitated  and  expanded.  This  output  will \ninclude  (a)  rehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  sewerage  network,  including \nproperty connections; (b) construction of interceptor sewers along the river banks; \nand (c) rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations. \nOutput  2:  Wastewater  treatment  plants  modernized  and  expanded.  This \noutput will include (a) modernization and expansion of five WWTPs to provide 90.5 \nMLD  capacity,  (b)  energy  generation  through  sludge  digestion  and  gasification, \nand (c) decentralized wastewater treatment systems in low-income areas.

The  project  will  strengthen  KUKL\u2019s \ncapacity  to  improve  its  wastewater  operations,  and  KVWSMB\u2019s  and  WSTFC\u2019s  respective \ncapacities as asset owner and regulator. KUKL will develop a proper organizational structure and \ndeploy  adequate  personnel  for  its  sewerage  operations  to  handle  additional  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) responsibilities.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nCondition  assessment  survey,  geographic \n\n \ninformation  system,  and  asset \n15. \nmanagement  plan.  The  project  will  support  KVWSMB  and  KUKL  to  carry  out  a  condition \nassessment survey and develop a sewerage GIS and an asset management plan, focusing on an \nintegrated approach to repairing, maintaining, rehabilitating, and replacing sewerage assets. \n \n16. \nAdoption  of  energy  efficient  treatment  processes  and  energy  generation  from \nsludge. The existing WWTPs are located in densely populated areas and current processes are \ninefficient  and  ineffective.  Under  the  project,  existing  WWTPs  will  be  upgraded  with  energy \nefficient  and  mechanized  treatment  processes,  and  WWTP  designs  will  integrate  septage \nhandling facilities. To mitigate the problem of intermittent and unreliable power supply, the project \nwill  facilitate  (i)  energy  generation  from  sludge  digestion  or  gasification,  (ii)  dedicated  power \nsupply from the national grid, and (iii) standby diesel generator sets. \n \n17. \nOperation  and  maintenance  embedded  construction  contracts  for  operational \nsustainability. The project will include O&M embedded construction contracts combining design, \nconstruction,  and  O&M  for  WWTPs  for  a  sufficiently  long  period  (5\u20137  years).  This  will  mitigate \nKUKL\u2019s  lack  of  O&M  capacity,  improve  the  quality  of  construction  by  providing  continuity  in \nsystem operation, and obligate KUKL to allocate adequate O&M budget.   \n \n18. \nSeparation of sanitary sewers from storm water drains. The Kathmandu Valley has a \ncombined  sewer  and  storm  water  drainage  system.  Various  reports  in  the  past  have \nrecommended separating these systems. The project will promote separation of storm water and \nsanitary  sewer  systems  in  most  of  the  areas,  while  recognizing  that  complete  separation  is \ndifficult and impractical in some locations. \n \n19. \nIntegrated  planning  and  development  of  wastewater  treatment  plant  sites.  The \nproject will support integrated planning and development of WWTP sites and surrounding areas, \nespecially  at  Dhobighat,  which  will  focus  on  (i)  landscaping,  plantation,  and  gardens;  (ii)  solid-\nwaste  management;  (iii)  development  of  water  bodies;  and  (iv)  riverfront  development  including \neducational and recreational activities such as water sports, walkways, restaurants, etc.    \n \n20. \nLinks  with  Melamchi  tunnel  project.  The  project  assumes  the  availability  of  170  MLD \nwater  from  the  Melamchi  tunnel  and  assessment  of  current  progress  of  the  Melamchi  tunnel \nindicates that it is likely to be completed by 2016 as per the updated plan. The government will \nmonitor progress of the Melamchi tunnel to ensure timely completion. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nEconomic analysis. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.6%; the \nnet  present  value  is  $24.6  million.  The  EIRR  is  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of \ncapital,  estimated  at  12.0%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  return.  The  results  from  sensitivity \nanalysis,  ranging  from  13.4%  to  14.5%,  are  satisfactory  against  downside  risks,  including  10% \nincrease in capital expenditure, 10% increase in operating costs, 10% decrease in benefits, and \n1-year  delay  in  project  completion.  The  EIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  a  reduction  in  beneficiaries. \nHigh population growth is likely to sustain demand for water supply and sanitation services.18   \n \n22. \nFinancial  analysis.  The  estimated  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  3.22%;  the  net \npresent  value  is  NRs4,197  million  ($47.7  million).  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  higher \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  1.11%,  indicating  reasonable  financial \nreturn.  The  results  from  sensitivity  analysis,  ranging  from  2.34%  to  3.03%,  are  satisfactory \n                                                \n18 Details are included in the economic analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fagainst downside risks, including capital cost overruns by 10%, O&M cost overruns by 10%, and \nrevenue reduced by 10%. The proposed water tariff and sewerage tariff sufficient to fully recover \nO&M  costs  are  approximately  1.25%  of  income  for  low-income  households,  implying  that  the \nproject is also affordable for low-income households.19   \n \nFinancial  sustainability.  The  capacity  building  and  public\u2013private  partnership  team  will \n23. \nsupport KUKL focusing on (i) rationalization of tariffs; (ii) improvement of collection efficiency; (iii) \nrecovery  of  arrears  with  adequate  provisioning for  bad debts; (iv)  computerization  of  operations \nand  financial  management;  (v)  improvement  of  cash  management  and  use  of  banks;  (vi)  field \nverifications  of  house  connections;  and  (vii)  introduction  of  sewerage  tariffs  for  big  consumers \n(hotels, etc.) proportionate to the volume of wastewater discharged.   \n\nC. \n\n \nGovernance \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the PID. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  PAM  (footnote  17).  Risk  assessment  was  made  with  the  help  of  a  tool \nspecifically  developed  for  Nepal.20  Based  on  these  assessments,  some  of  the  mitigation \nmeasures  incorporated  in  the  project  design  aim  to  (i)  establish  a  mechanism  for  regular \nvoluntary  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to  citizens;  (ii)  develop  and  update  a  project \nwebsite  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and  safeguards;  and \n(iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective resolution. \n \n25. \nCoordination with the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of  the \nBagmati  Civilization.  The  project  shares  the  vision  of  the  High  Powered  Committee  for \nIntegrated Development of the Bagmati Civilization (HPCIDBC) to improve the water quality in the \nBagmati  River  and  its  tributaries.  Accordingly,  under  the  project  the WWTPs  at  Guheswori  and \nGokarna will be rehabilitated to higher effluent standards to improve water quality upstream of the \nholy  Pasupatinath  Temple.  Moreover,  the  project  will  coordinate  with  the  HPCIDBC  to  develop \ncommon design standards for sewerage systems. \n \n26. \nCoordination  with  other  agencies  for  proper  solid-waste  management.  Currently, \nsubstantial  quantities  of  solid  waste  are  dumped  in  the  Bagmati  River  and  its  tributaries, \naggravating  the  already  poor  quality  of  water  caused  by  disposal  of  untreated  sewage.  In \naddition,  solid  waste  is  frequently  disposed  of  in  sewers  and  manholes,  causing  blockages, \nflooding,  and  operational  problems.  The  project  will  coordinate  with  municipalities  and  other \nagencies to improve solid-waste management through community awareness and participation. \n \n27. \nInstitutional  arrangements  of  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited.  The \ngovernment  will  refine  KUKL\u2019s  institutional  structure  to  enforce  its  accountability  to  the \ngovernment and citizens, and to ensure sustainability of its operations.       \n  \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n28. \nThe project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A poverty and social analysis \nhas  been  completed,21  and  the  project  gives  priority  to  connecting  all  poor  households  and \nhouseholds headed by women to the sewerage network in the project area. The government and \nKUKL  will  reform  the  current  sewerage  connections  policy  to  facilitate  individual  sewerage \n\n                                                \n19  Details are included in the financial analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Peace  Filter  for  Design  and  Implementation  of  Project  (accessible  from  the  list  of  supplementary  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n21  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nconnections to the poor, socially excluded, and households headed by women. Connection fees \nwill  be  reduced  for  poor  households  under  the  project.  A  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion \naction  plan  was  prepared  with  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation.22  A \ncommunity awareness and participation plan has also been prepared under the project to involve \nkey stakeholders for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation.23 The PID will implement \nthe  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  and  community  awareness  and  participation  plan,  with \nsupport from the community awareness and participation consultant recruited under the project.  \n \n29. \nPro-poor  and  gender-inclusive  sanitation  services.  Building  on  the  low-income \nconsumer service unit strategy developed by KUKL, the project will complement KUKL's ongoing \nefforts to further strengthen its pro-poor and gender-inclusive sanitation services by focusing on \n(i) implementing appropriate measures to make  the Kathmandu Valley open-defecation free; (ii) \nstudy  of  past  sanitation  projects  in  low-income  consumer  areas,  including  decentralized \nwastewater treatment systems, and drawing applicable lessons from such sanitation projects; (iii) \nincorporating  strategies  for  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive  sanitation  services  in  KUKL's  future \ninvestment plans and wastewater master plans; (iv) recording data on underserved settlements in \nthe GIS; and (v) piloting alternative onsite sanitation in selected low-income areas. \n\nE. \n\n \nSafeguards \n\n30. \nSocial safeguards. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  A  resettlement  plan24  and  a  resettlement  framework25  were \nprepared  and  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and \nOperation Manual.26 The project does not include any component that will require land acquisition \nor resettlement activities causing any significant impact. All sites for the construction of WWTPs \nand  sewerage  network  are  located  within  existing  WWTP  sites  or  on  government  land  along \nroads or riverbanks. The decentralized wastewater treatment systems shall be located in places \nthat do not require any land acquisition. Most of the land acquisition for the WWTPs was carried \nout  during  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s.  The  project  will  ensure  that  the  land  acquired  for \nWWTPs continues to comply with all relevant laws and policies of the government. The impacts \nduring construction will be limited to (i) temporary losses for a few cultivators along the riverbanks \nduring the laying of sewers, (ii) temporary disruption of business activities and shifting of vendors \nand  hawkers  during  construction  works,  and  (iii)  permanent  loss  of  access  to  land  for  a  few \ninformal  cultivators  at  the  Gokarna  WWTP  site.  The  compensation  for  lost  income  will  be \nprovided to those affected as per the resettlement plan and resettlement framework. No adverse \nimpacts on indigenous peoples are anticipated, and improved wastewater facilities will benefit all \nhouseholds including indigenous peoples in the project areas. The project will avoid cultural sites \nused  by  indigenous  peoples,  if  identified  during  detailed  design.  Meaningful  and  widespread \nconsultations  will  continue  with  all  communities in  the  project  area.  The  government  will  initiate \nacquisition of land at Khokana for future construction of the WWTP. The project will support the \nstudy of technical and environmental feasibility and adequate protection of this site.   \n \n31. \nEnvironmental  safeguards.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)27  and  environmental  management  plan  were  prepared \nand  disclosed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).

The IEE and the environmental management \nplan  will  be  updated  during  detailed  design  and  incorporated  into  contract  documents.  The  IEE \nshows  substantive  net  positive  environmental  benefit,  including  (i)  improved  wastewater \nmanagement  to  safeguard  public  health,  and  (ii)  cleaner  waterways  and  urban  environment \nthrough increased sewage treatment. Additional measures will be taken during pipe laying works \nwithin roads passing through heritage areas to ensure there are no impacts during construction. \nPermission  from  the  Department  of  Archaeology  will  be  obtained  prior  to  commencement  of \nconstruction,  particularly  in  Patan  and  Darbar  Squares.  Measures  to  manage  any  impacts \npertaining  to  slope  stability,  erosion,  and  sedimentation  will  be  implemented  prior  to  laying \ninterceptors  along  the  rivers.  As  part  of  the  detailed  design  of  the  new  WWTPs,  air  quality \ndispersion  modeling  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  odor  management  measures  are  incorporated \ninto the environmental monitoring system. In addition, perimeter buffers will be established along \nthe boundaries of the WWTPs to minimize odors released from the premises. To ensure optimal \noperations of WWTPs at all times, safety plans will be developed and implemented.29 \n \n32. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  of  wastewater  quality.  The  project  will  support  the \ngovernment  to  monitor  environmental  regulatory  standards.  This  will  include  development  of  (i) \ndomestic sewage discharge standards,30 (ii) a mechanism for monitoring the quality of discharge \nto  streams  and  rivers  in  the  valley,  (iii)  a  properly  equipped  laboratory,  (iv)  procedures  for \nenforcement of pretreatment of industrial effluent before discharging to sewer network or stream, \n(v) a septage management plan, and (vi) processing and disposal of sludge and screenings.  \n \n33. \nNatural  disasters  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation.  The  project  will \nincorporate  adequate  adaptation  measures  for  the  risks  related  to  earthquakes,  landslides, \nfloods,  and  climate  change.  The  detailed  designs  of  the  project  components  will  consider  the \nfindings from ongoing strategic programs for climate resilience as basis for incorporating possible \nclimate  change  adaptation  measures.  These  programs  were  funded  by  ADB  and  development \npartners through the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience of the Climate Investment Funds.31 The \nproject  will  facilitate  energy  generation  through  the  use  of  sludge  produced  and  collected  at \nWWTPs, which will help mitigate climate change impacts.   \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.32  The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  of  the \nproject are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nTransition to a federal \nstructure, the peace process, \nand political instability may \naffect project implementation. \nWater from the Melamchi \ntunnel may not be available on \ntime. \n\nMitigating Measures \nDevelopment partners will maintain close dialogue with the government and other \nstakeholders to ensure that the development and reform process is not derailed. \nThe project will involve key stakeholders generating consensus for its successful \nimplementation. \nMOUD and ADB will closely monitor the tunnel work to ensure timely completion. \nRegular ADB missions will be fielded to update the risk assessment and suggest \nfurther mitigation measures. \n\n                                                \n28   Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29   WWTP safety plans use a comprehensive risk management approach for all steps in the process. \n30   Standards for industrial and commercial discharge are available in the Environmental Protection Act. \n31   ADB. 2011.
