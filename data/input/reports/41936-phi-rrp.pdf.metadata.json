NPC  is  a  state-owned  vertically  integrated  electricity  utility, \nwhich has now been unbundled. The Masinloc plant was constructed in the 1990s with public \nsector  loans  from  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Export-Import  Bank  of  Japan  (now \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation).  \n \n3. \nOn  26  June  2001,  Republic  Act  No.  9136,  otherwise  known  as  the  Electric  Power \nIndustry  Reform  Act  of  2001  (EPIRA),  became  law.  EPIRA  provides  the  legal  basis  and \nframework for restructuring the Philippine electricity sector. The goals of the restructuring under \nEPIRA are to promote competition and efficiency in the sector in order to reduce power rates, \nimprove nationwide electrification levels, enhance the inflow of private capital, and broaden the \nownership  base  of  the  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  sectors  so  they  can \nmeet  projected  increases  in  the  demand  for  power.  EPIRA  created  the  Power  Sector  Assets \nand Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) to privatize certain generating assets of NPC. \nEPIRA\u2019s target was to privatize 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in Luzon and Visayas by June \n2004,  but  to  date  only  eight  hydropower  plants,  with  a  combined  capacity  of  475  MW,  have \nbeen auctioned off for $664 million (11% of the eligible capacity).1  \n \nThe  original  intention  was  for  the  Masinloc  plant  to  be  the  first  major  facility  to  be \n4. \nprivatized and the plant was put out to an international tender in December 2004. The bid was \nwon by YNN Pacific Consortium, a joint venture between YNN Holdings of the Philippines and \nthe Australia-based Great Pacific Financial Group, for $562 million. However, in the absence of \npower  purchase  agreements  and  a  perceived  uncertainty  in  the  regulatory  and  market \nenvironment,  YNN  was  unable  to  secure  financing  even  for  the  down  payment  of  40%  of  the \nacquisition price and the bid was declared a failure in August 2006.2 The 600 MW Calaca coal-\nfired power plant was also put out to a tender in April 2006 but that tender also failed.3  \n \n5. \nWith one year\u2019s operating track record of the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM), \nthe Masinloc plant was again put out to tender in July 2007. There were six bidders4 and AES \nCorporation  (AES)  of  the  United  States,  through  its  subsidiary  Masinloc  Power  Partners \n\n                                                 \n1  The first five of these were small plants, the sixth was a 112 MW plant, and the seventh was the 360 MW Magat \nplant, acquired in April 2007 by SN Aboitiz Power, a joint venture between SN Power Invest of Norway and Aboitiz \nEquity  Venture  of  the  Philippines.  A  long-term  debt  of  $380  million  was  arranged  for  Magat  with  International \nFinance Corporation, Nordic Investment Bank, and other foreign and local banks in October 2007. \n\n2  Apart from YNN, First Generation Holdings was the only other bidder. \n3  The Calaca bid was declared a failure because the best offer ($177 million) did not meet the reserve price ($288 \nmillion). Although Calaca had a power purchase agreement for 100 MW, this was not enough to ensure a higher \nbid.  \n\n4  Other bidders were: First Generation Holdings of the Philippines, Ranhill of Malaysia, Suez-Tractebel of Belgium, \n\nInternational Power of the United Kingdom, and Shenhua of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nCompany  Limited  (MPPC),  won  the  award  at  $930  million.5  Since  the  announcement  of  the \nsecond tender of the Masinloc plant, ADB was approached by several of the bidders with regard \nto  financial  assistance.  In  anticipation  of  a  request  for  financial  assistance  from  the  winning \nbidder, ADB circulated a draft concept clearance paper for interdepartmental comments on 16 \nJuly 2007. When the winning bid was announced and MPPC confirmed its interest in receiving \nfinancial support, the concept clearance paper was finalized and approved by Management on \n13 August 2007.  \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nPower Sector \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply \n\n6. \nThe  Philippine  power  system  is  divided  into  three  major  grids:  Luzon,  Visayas,  and \nMindanao.  The  Luzon  grid,  with  a  total  installed  capacity  of  12,092  MW,  is  the  largest  of  the \nthree and accounts for 73% of the demand. The largest load center in the country is the Metro \nManila  area,  representing  close  to  65%  of  national  electricity  sales.  The  Philippine  system  is \nrelatively well diversified in terms of the fuel sources (Table 1). \n \n\nTable 1: Installed Capacity in the Philippines and Luzon by Fuel Source in 2006 \n \n\n \n\nFuel \n\nInstalled Capacity in \nthe Philippines (MW) \n\nCoal \nDiesel/oil \nHydro \nNatural gas \nGeothermal \nNonconventional \nTotal \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Department of Energy, Power Statistics.  \n\n4,177 \n3,602 \n3,257 \n2,763 \n1,978 \n26 \n15,803 \n\n% \n\n26 \n23 \n21 \n17 \n13 \n0 \n100 \n\nInstalled Capacity \nin Luzon (MW) \n3,769 \n2,333 \n2,247 \n2,763 \n954 \n25 \n12,092 \n\n% \n\n31 \n19 \n19 \n23 \n8 \n0 \n100 \n\n \n7. \nIn terms of the ownership, the Government\u2019s share (plants owned by NPC) is low at 26% \nwith  74%  owned  by  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  others  (Table  2).  However, \neffective control over many IPP assets lies with NPC or Meralco because of the power purchase \nagreements (PPAs) that they have with NPC or Meralco. \n\n                                                 \n5  There was a second tender for Calaca in October 2007 and this was won by Suez-Tractebel for $787 million over \ntwo other bidders, AES and First Generation Holdings. Once the Masinloc and Calaca sales are complete, PSALM \nwill have successfully bid out 10 of the 31 plants identified for privatization. This translates to 1,681 MW in capacity, \nor 39% of the 4,336 MW total capacity of all NPC plants in Luzon and the Visayas. \n\n\f3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2: Installed Capacity in the Philippines and Luzon by Ownership in 2006 \n\nOwnership \n\nNPC \nIPP with PPAs with NPC \nIPPs with PPAs with Meralco \nOthers \nTotal \n\nInstalled Capacity in the \nPhilippines (MW) \n4,173 \n8,113 \n2,304 \n1,213 \n15,803 \n\n% \n\n26 \n51 \n15 \n8 \n100 \n\nInstalled Capacity in \nLuzon (MW) \n2,469 \n6,669 \n2,304 \n649 \n12,092 \n\n% \n\n20 \n55 \n19 \n5 \n100 \n\nIPP  =  independent  power  producers,  Meralco  =  Manila  Electric  Company,  MW  =  megawatt,  NPC  =  National \nPower Corporation, PPA = power purchase agreement. \nSource: Department of Energy, Power Statistics. \n\n \nIn  2006,  the  dependable  capacity  in  Luzon  (10,576  MW)  exceeded  the  peak  demand \n8. \n(6,728 MW) by 57% and the required capacity6 (8,302 MW) by 22%.7 The Department of Energy \n(DOE), however, estimates that energy consumption in Luzon will increase at an average rate of \n4.0% per annum. Given the retirement of two major power plants8 scheduled in 2009\u20132010 and \nthe  construction  of  only  38  MW  of  committed  projects,  DOE  projects  that  the  Luzon  grid  will \nneed  about  1,950  MW  of  additional  generating  capacity  by  2014  (Table  3).  If  no  additional \ncapacity comes onstream,9 the critical period in the Luzon grid will be in 2011 when the reserve \nmargin falls below the required level. DOE estimates that roughly P71.0 billion ($1.7 billion) is \nneeded to finance the additional capacity required in Luzon.  \n \n\nTable 3: Supply and Demand Projection in Luzon 2006\u20132014 (MW) \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n8 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n30 \n\n650 \n\n100 \n\n2012 \n\n2011 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2010 \n\n2009 \n\n2008 \n\n6,728 \n\n10,576 \n\n10,576 \n\n10,584 \n\n10,576 \n\nItem \nCommitted \nCapacity \nAddition \nRetiring \nCapacity \nDependable \nCapacity (DC) \nPeak  Demand \n(PD) \nSurplus \n(S=DC-PD) \nReserve  Margin \n(S/PD) \nRequired \nCapacity \n(PDx123.4%) \nIndicative \nCapacity \nRequirement \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Department of Energy modified by Asian Development Bank staff to highlight key points. \n\n10,607 \n\n10,514 \n\n10,150 \n\n7,878 \n\n9,864 \n\n8,225 \n\n8,302 \n\n8,614 \n\n9,721 \n\n9,319 \n\n9,864 \n\n3,595 \n\n6,981 \n\n3,032 \n\n8,596 \n\n7,552 \n\n3,848 \n\n8,949 \n\n7,252 \n\n3,324 \n\n1,639 \n\n1,268 \n\n2,636 \n\n15% \n\n20% \n\n52% \n\n57% \n\n46% \n\n34% \n\n40% \n\n450 \n\n450 \n\n150 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n9,864 \n\n9,864 \n\n8,990 \n\n9,397 \n\n874 \n\n10% \n\n467 \n\n5% \n\n11,093 \n\n11,596 \n\n600 \n\n600 \n\n                                                 \n6  Required  capacity  refers  to  the  peak  demand  plus  the  reserve  margin  approved  by  the  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission  above  the  peak  demand  of  23.4%,  consisting  of  a  2.8%  load  following  and  frequency  regulation, \n10.3% spinning reserve, and 10.3% back-up. \n\n7  However, the net reserve margin computed from the actual available capacity was less than the reported reserve \n\nmargin after adjusting for hydropower capacity and fuel supply and transmission constraints. \n\n8  The power plants scheduled for retirement are Hopewell gas turbine power plant (dependable capacity of 100 MW) \n\nand the Malaya oil thermal power plants (dependable capacity of 650 MW). \n\n9  The Power Development Plan assumes that roughly 1,750 MW from three power plants will be commissioned by \n2009\u20132010. This remains indicative as construction has not started on any of the  plants (San Gabriel, Ilijan  gas-\nfired expansion, and GN Power coal-fired).  \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nRegulation \n\n9. \nFrom  1993  to  2001,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Board  (ERB)  regulated  NPC  and  the \ndistribution  utilities.  Under  the  EPIRA,  industry  regulation  became  the  responsibility  of  the \nEnergy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC).  New  functions  and  responsibilities  have  been \nintroduced,  including:  (i)  developing  and  enforcing  technical  standards  for  transmission  and \ndistribution; (ii) enforcing WESM rules; (iii) licensing generators and suppliers of electricity; (iii) \nsetting a retail tariff for non-contestable sectors of the industry; (iv) determining and approving \nthe level of the universal charge; (v) preventing abuse of market power and anti-competitive or \ndiscriminatory  behavior  by  industry  participants;  and  (vi)  resolving  disputes  between  industry \nparticipants or between industry participants and customers.  \n \nSince the beginning of WESM, apart from the tariff of NPC-owned plants under bilateral \n10. \ncontracts,  wholesale  tariffs  are  no  longer  regulated.  Retail  tariffs  are  still  regulated.  Following \nthe passing of EPIRA, the retail tariff was unbundled and all distribution utilities are required to \nfile  a  petition  with  the  ERC  for  the  approval  of  unbundled  rates.  In  the  unbundled  rates, \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  supply,  and  universal  charges10  are  separately  itemized \non  a  customer  bill  and  a  change  in  a  component  is  treated  as  a  pass-through  (although  ERC \napproval  is  required  to  before  the  change  can  be  reflected  in  customer  bills).  While  rate \nunbundling was intended to be technically revenue neutral, the process has effectively involved \na review of existing costs, and distribution rates have been revised (downward for some utilities) \nas a result.  \n \n11. \nThe  distribution  business  is  still  a  largely  regulated  natural  monopoly,  and  most  retail \nusers can purchase power only from distributors. Generators can sell only to either distribution \nutilities or to special economic zones. Distribution utilities may be private-investor-owned utilities \n(IOUs),  electric  cooperatives,  or  local  government  utilities.  IOUs  account  for  77%  of  total \nelectricity  sales  with  the  remainder  coming  largely  from  electric  cooperatives.  The  largest \ndistribution  utility  in  terms  of  sales  is  Manila  Electricity  Company  (Meralco).  When  retail \ncompetition  is  implemented  (expected  about  2011  or  later),  the  retail  tariff  to  contestable \ncustomers11 will cease to be regulated. \n \n\n3. \n\nIssues and Sector Reform \n\n12. \nHigh Electricity Price. Electricity in the Philippines is among the most expensive in the \nworld.  Given  excess  capacity,  efficient  generation  prices  should  approximate  the  fuel  costs  of \nthe  marginal  generator.  In  power  markets  that  do  not  levy  differential  environmental  taxes  on \ndifferent fuel sources, direct cost considerations would dictate that gas plants be utilized to meet \npeak demand, while base load be met by coal, hydropower, or geothermal power, since these \nare  the  plants  with  lower  economic  fuel  costs.  Given  that  60%  of  the  installed  capacity  in  the \n\n                                                 \n10 The universal charge is a component of the retail tariff that is meant to recover (i) environmental protection costs, \n(ii)  rural  electrification  costs,  and  (iii)  NPC\u2019s  \u201cstranded  costs\u201d  (i.e.,  the  take-or-pay  capacity  payments  under  the \nPPAs)  and  \u201cstranded  debt\u201d.  Currently,  the  universal  charge  is  set  to  cover  the  first  two  components  only.  Spot \nelectricity price data suggest that the generation cost component of the retail tariff incorporates part of the stranded \ncosts of NPC. However, the stranded debt is not reflected in any component of the tariff.  \n\n11 Contestable customers will be initially defined as those end-users with a monthly average peak consumption of at \nleast 1 MW. Under open access, contestable customers are allowed to choose their electricity supplier, who buys \nor generates the electricity, which distribution utilities will be compelled to deliver over their lines. End-users will pay \nthe distribution and transmission companies all other incidental charges at regulated rates. Over time, the definition \nof  contestable  customers  will  gradually  be  expanded  to  include  smaller  consumers,  ultimately  extending  to  the \nhousehold level. Uncontestable customers are end-users that must still buy power from the generator or supplier \ntheir local distribution utility chooses to contract with.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nPhilippines  is  coal,  hydropower,  and  geothermal,  one  would  expect  gas  plants  to  be  the \nmarginal  generator.  However,  the  opposite  is  occurring:  most  gas-fired  power  plants  in  the \nPhilippines  are  base-loaded  and  coal  plants  are  on  the  margin  most  of  the  time.  Further, \nelectricity  prices  are  much  higher  than  the  cost  of  generation.  Operating  and  price  data  show \nthat the Philippine power prices are determined by institutional and financial arrangements, not \neconomic forces. \n \n13. \nPower  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  are  the  main  driver  of  high  electricity  costs in  the \nPhilippines. Power generation and transmission was a virtual monopoly for NPC until the power \ncapacity  shortage  in  the  early  1990s  forced  the  Government  to  enter  into  contractual \narrangements  with  independent  power  producers  (IPPs).  The  Build-Operate-Transfer  (BOT) \nLaw  provided  the  legal  mandate  and  paved  the  way  for  NPC  and  eventually  for  private \ndistribution utilities to source power from IPPs through PPAs. PPAs continued to be signed even \nafter  the  power  crisis  was  resolved  in  1993,  as  NPC  built  excess  reserves  in  light  of  positive \neconomic  growth  projections.  However  the  Asian  financial  crisis  suppressed  economic  growth \nand  reduced  electricity  demand,  leading  to  a  significant  surplus  of  power  generating  capacity, \nespecially in Luzon. Installed capacity nationwide reached 15,803 MW in 2006 against the peak \ndemand  of 10,749  MW.  Installed  capacity  in  Luzon  was  12,092  MW  in 2006  against  the  peak \ndemand of 6,728 MW. Today, there are 61 IPPs in total, representing 72% of the total installed \ncapacity of the country. Of these, 35 IPPs (8,141 MW) have PPAs with NPC, and 3 IPPs (2,304 \nMW)  have  PPAs  with  Manila  Electric  Company  (Meralco)  with  varying  tenor  and  take-or-pay \nlevels.12 About 53% of installed capacity nationwide is subject to PPAs with take-or-pay clauses \nthat cover at least 73% of capacity for the next 15 years or so.  \n \nThe  PPAs  exert  three  distinct  upward  pressures  on  prices.  First,  take-or-pay  capacity \n14. \npayments to IPPs imply that the nonfuel costs of electricity must be recovered even when power \nis  not  being  generated.  NPC  and  distribution  utilities  such  as  Meralco  are  largely  permitted  to \ncover their take-or-pay liabilities by passing these costs on to the end users.13 Second, the PPA \nprices are high by industry standards.14 Third, and less widely recognized, the PPAs and cross-\nownership  of  generation  and  distribution  severely  distort  the  fuel  mix,  so  that  higher-cost  gas \nplants are frequently run while lower cost plants (coal, geothermal, and hydropower) sit idle.  \n \nSector  Reform.  To  lower  the  electricity  price,  the  Government  embarked  on  market-\n15. \noriented  reform  program  and  in  June  2001  EPIRA  became  law.  The  reform  plan  embodied  in \nEPIRA mandated a radical restructuring and includes the following actions: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ncreation of PSALM to take ownership of and manage the orderly privatization of \nNPC\u2019s generation and transmission assets; \ncreation of WESM to provide competition in the wholesale electricity market; \nabolition of ERB and the creation of a more robust and more independent ERC \nwith  the  power  to  set  tariffs  in  the  noncompetitive  transmission  and  distribution \n\n                                                 \n12 Others IPPs either have PPAs with other buyers or sell on a merchant basis.  \n13 NPC\u2019s  obligations  arising  from  these  PPAs  amounted  to  P596  billion  in  2005,  representing  more  than  half  of  its \nP1.07 trillion total liabilities. NPC\u2019s total liabilities account for about a third of the country\u2019s public sector debt, and \nP200 billion of these liabilities have already been absorbed by the Government. \n\n14 The initial PPAs were negotiated when the country was facing severe power shortages, which explains the higher \nprices; however, the same cannot be the case for the more recently negotiated PPAs. PSALM has renegotiated the \nPPA price with 25 of the 35 IPP contracts as of May 2007 with six having expired during the renegotiation process \nand  four  left  to  be  finalized.  One  PPA  was  cancelled  because  the  associated  plant  was  never  built.  These \nrenegotiations  and  the  cancellation  resulted  in  about  $1.03  billion  worth  of  total  avoided  costs  (or  reduction  in \nstranded contract costs) in present value terms. However, the net impact on electricity prices was minimal and only \nlimited relief was achieved.  \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\nsubsectors and with wide-ranging powers to regulate the behavior of participants \nin all sectors of the industry; and  \ndevelopment,  subject  to  certain  conditions,  of  competition  in  the  retail supply  of \nelectricity,  starting  with  large  electricity  users  and  eventually  extending  to  the \nsupply of electricity to the household level.  \n\n \nAfter 6 years of EPIRA, the power sector is still struggling to implement these changes \n\n16. \nas described below. \n \n17. \nGeneration  Assets.  In  the  generation  sector,  PSALM\u2019s  original  target  for  power  plant \nprivatization  was  to  have  70%  of  NPC\u2019s  eligible  assets  in  Luzon  and  Visayas  (totalling  4,336 \nMW)  privatized  by  June  2004.  Privatization  got  off  to  a  slow  start  but  has  gained  momentum \nsince  late  2006.  During  late  2006  and  2007,  PSALM  succeeded  in  selling  eight  hydropower \nplants  totalling  475  MW  (11%  of  the  target)  for  $664  million.  The  Masinloc  power  plant  is  the \nninth and the largest power plant offered for privatization.  \n \nThe installed capacity and power generation in Luzon by ownership is shown in Table 4. \n18. \nWhile the share of IPPs is 80%, most of the IPP generating capacity is contracted with NPC or \nMeralco  through  PPAs.  This  means  is  that  the  Luzon  power  generation  market  (WESM)  is \ncontrolled by three dominant players (NPC, PSALM, and Meralco) on the supply side with only a \n5% market share held by independent players. Some companies operate on both sides of the \nmarket.  Acquisition  of  Masinloc  by  AES  is  another  step,  following  the  earlier  privatization  of \neight hydropower plants, in further diversifying the generation market. \n \n\nTable 4: Installed Capacity and Generation in Luzon by Ownership in 2006 \n\n \n\nOwnership \n\nInstalled Capacity \n(MW) \n2,469 \n\n6,669 \n\n% \n\n20 \n\n55 \n\nGeneration \n(GWh) \n10,547 \n\n15,698 \n\nNPC \nIPP  with  PPAs  with  NPC \n(administered by PSALM) \nIPPs with PPAs with Meralco \nOthers \nTotal \n\n14,309 \n688 \n41,242 \n IPP = independent power producer, Meralco = Manila Electricity Company, MW = megawatt,  \n NPC = National Power Corporation, PPA = power purchase agreement. \n Source: Department of Energy, Power Statistics. \n\n2,304 \n649 \n12,091 \n\n19 \n5 \n100 \n\n% \n\n26 \n\n38 \n\n35 \n2 \n100 \n\n \n19. \nTransmission  Assets.  Transmission  has  now  been  spun  off  into  a  state-owned \ncompany  called  National  Transmission  Company  (Transco).  The  Government  has  decided  to \nprivatize  Transco  by  awarding  a  concession  for  the  use  of  the  transmission  assets.  However, \nseveral attempts to bid out the concession contract have failed. PSALM launched another round \nof bidding in July 2007 and the bids are expected in December 2007.  \n \n20.  Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. WESM started operations in the Luzon grid in June \n2006. It was designed to fulfill a wide range of objectives, the foremost of which is the promotion \nof competition in the generation sector. WESM is a mandatory gross-offer pool with net bilateral \nsettlement  and  locational  marginal  pricing.  All  generators  are  required  to  offer  into  the  market \nbut  may  settle  directly  bilateral  contracts  (PPAs)  that  are  registered  with  Philippine  Electricity \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nMarket Corporation (PEMC), the market operator.15 Prices are based on the marginal generator. \nOf the total volume traded, 15-45% represent spot transactions and the rest represent bilateral \ntransactions (under PPAs), depending on the month. \n \nThe system operator is part of Transco and is in charge of central dispatch and system \n21. \nstability. It schedules enough power generation to meet expected power demand throughout the \nday,  with  adequate  reserve  margins  to  take  care  of  contingencies.  All  energy,  including \nquantities  sold  through  bilateral  contracts,  is  dispatched  by  the  system  operator.  Once  the \nmarket operator has matched bids with expected demand and determined the market-clearing \nprice, the market operator generates and forwards the dispatch schedule to the system operator \nfor implementation. Participants settle their accounts by the hour once the system operator has \ninformed them of the prices and schedules. The WESM market design was largely derived from \nthe New Zealand market and is similar to the system in Singapore.  \n \n22. \nSpot market prices since the commencement of WESM have ranged between a high of \nP12/kWh  and  a  low  of  P0/kWh,16  averaging  about  P4.2/kWh.17  WESM  prices  shot  up  from \nP2.72/kWh during the first trading month to P4.85/kWh in the third month. This led the PEMC to \nlaunch an investigation and to issue a report accusing PSALM of anti-competitive behavior.18  \n \n23. \nIt is not surprising that spot prices have been high. As described above, WESM currently \nhas  only  a  limited  number  of  participants,  with  three  of  them  (NPC,  PSALM,  and  Meralco) \ncommanding market power. \n  \n24. \nAs  of  September  2007,  the  load  weighted  average  spot  price  at  WESM  was  about \nP4.5/kWh.  Although  EPIRA  did  not  stipulate  any  prerequisites  for  the  launch  of  WESM,  the \nexpectations  were  that  about  70%  of  NPC\u2019s  generating  assets  would  have  been  privatized  by \nthen. Even as privatization stalled, the Government went ahead with WESM. As a salve for the \nexcessive market share of PSALM, the task of bidding to sell the capacity of NPC- contracted \nIPPs on WESM was delegated to four PSALM trading groups (now consolidated into three). The \nintention  was  that  these  groups  would  act  independently  with  the  objective  of  optimizing \nutilization  and  revenue  from  the  plants.  However,  the  extent  to  which  these  three  teams  act \nindependently of each other has been questioned, as they are subject to PSALM\u2019s management \nauthority and governance.  \n \n25. \nRecognizing  this  structural  defect,  PSALM  is  currently  undertaking  an  initiative,  with \nassistance  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  to  appoint  independent  IPP  administrators  in  an \nattempt  to  introduce  more  competitive  players  into  the  market.  However,  this  initiative  has \nalready been under discussion for more than 2 years, with as yet little real progress. The design \n\n                                                 \n15 PEMC is a non-profit organization created by the Department of Energy to serve as an autonomous group market \noperator of WESM. It is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives from the different sectors in \nthe power industry: WESM, Transco, generators, and distributors. Neither the WESM rules nor EPIRA provided for \na  representative  from  end  users  of  electricity  except  for  representatives  from  economic  zones  and  the \nsemiconductor and electronics industries. \n\n16 For  more  than  15%  of  the  year  (from  midnight  to  6am),  actual  spot  prices  are  essentially  zero.  This  apparently \ncounterintuitive  result\u2014that  wholesale  electricity  is  free  at  the  margin\u2014is  a  product  of  the  gas-fired  generators \nbeing on take-or-pay contracts. These generators pay for the gas whether they burn it or not, and so during periods \nof  low  demand  are  willing  to  offer  their  power  at  zero  marginal  cost.  With  most  capacity  sold  to  distributors  on \ncontract,  however,  average  prices  are  well  above  zero.  Thermal  plants  also  have  to  maintain  minimum  running \nlevels overnight if they are to be able to ramp up for the higher demands in the day time. \n17 These are daily average prices. On an hourly basis, the highest price exceeds P18/kWh. \n18 The matter was referred to ERC as an apparent abuse of market power. ERC launched its own investigation and \n\nconcluded that there was no prima face case against PSALM and closed the investigation. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nof the contractual arrangements with an independent administrator is likely to be complex, and \nrapid progress is unlikely. It has also been recognized that NPC\u2019s debt should not intervene in \nthe price-making in the wholesale market. In a truly competitive market, the wholesale market \nprice is determined by the marginal cost of generation for the marginal plant. NPC\u2019s \u201cstranded \ncosts\u201d  and  \u201cstranded  debt\u201d  should  ideally  be  recovered  from  the  retail  tariff.  Steps  have  been \ntaken to distinguish clearly the market price from the price of recovering the stranded costs and \ndebt  by  unbundling  the  retail  tariff  into  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  supply  and \nuniversal  charges  separately  itemized  on  a  customer  bill.  However,  not  all  stranded  costs  or \ndebts are reflected in the retail tariff at this point.  \n \n26. \nOpen  Access  and  Retail  Competition.  In  2007,  ERC  issued  a  resolution  outlining  a \npossible timeline toward open access. Open access means that third parties are allowed to use \nthe  transmission  and/or  distribution  system  and  associated  facilities  of  any  distribution  utility, \nsubject to the payment of transmission and/or distribution retail wheeling rates duly approved by \nERC. In effect, distribution utilities will no longer have the right to refuse the use by third parties \nof  its  distribution  lines.  This  is  a  necessary  condition  for  competition,  among  generators, \ndistributors, and other forms of electricity suppliers, in the retail market. \n \n27. \nUnder Section 31 of EPIRA, ERC is only able to declare open access when a number of \nconditions have been met.19 Among the most important of these are: (i) privatization of at least \n70% of the total capacity of NPC generation assets in Luzon and Visayas; and (ii) transfer of the \nmanagement  and  control  of  at  least  70%  of  the  total  energy  output  of  power  plants  under \ncontracts with NPC to independent IPP administrators. In addition, ERC emphasized that it will \nconsider the creation of the appropriate customer switching arrangements and the adequacy of \nthe  generation  and  transmission  infrastructure  in  deciding  on  the  date  for  open  access.  ERC \nmust  conduct  a  public hearing  on  whether  all  the  necessary  conditions  have  been  met  before \ndeclaring open access, and the initial stage of open access (for loads of 1 MW and above) will \ncome into effect 6 months from the date of declaration. At this time, it is unclear when exactly \nopen access will come into effect but the earliest estimate is 2011. While the requirement that \n70%  of  NPC  generation  assets  be  privatized  may  be  met  as  soon  as  early  2009,  the \nprocurement of the IPP administrators has not yet begun. This is a new concept in competitive \npower  markets  that  has  not  been  tested  elsewhere  in  the  world  and  it  will  take  time  for  the \nmarket to understand the opportunities and the risks involved.  \n \nB. \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Philippines20 lists fiscal imbalance, a poor \n28. \ninvestment  climate,  and  weak  governance  as  the  country\u2019s  three  most  critical  binding \ndevelopment constraints.

The \nPower Sector Development Program (PSDP) will have a direct impact on fiscal consolidation 22 \nby  reducing  the  losses  at  NPC,  enhancing  the  creditworthiness  of  PSALM  and  the  energy \ncompanies,  and  creating  conditions  for  the  privatization  of  major  power  assets.23  The  CSP \nadvocates  more  cooperation  between  ADB\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  operations  to  enhance \ninvestor  confidence  and  promote  private  investment  critical  to  offset  fiscally-constrained  public \ninvestment. PSDP support for a well-regulated, privatized power sector, together with financial \ninvestments,  will  increase  investor  interest.  A  list  of  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the \nPhilippines is in Appendix 1. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy24  defines  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n29. \npoverty  by  creating  an  energy  infrastructure  for  sustainable  economic  growth;  (ii)  promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  investors;  (iii)  addressing  regional  and  global  environmental  impacts; \nand  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the energy  sector  to  take  advantage  of \nprivate  operators\u2019  higher  operational  efficiencies  and  to  respond  to  the  large  capital \nrequirements  of  power  projects.

The  Project  will  also  help  to  improve  the  investment  climate  by \nincreasing the reliability of generating capacity for commercial and industrial centers. Successful \nacquisition and operation of the Masinloc plant by a reputable foreign private sector will boost \nmarket  confidence  and  encourage  further  privatizations  of  NPC\u2019s  assets  and  the  entry  of  new \nplayers in the market. The Project will enhance competition in the generator market and, in the \nlong run, help to drive the electricity price down.  \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nLoan,  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram.

It  is  about  \n250 kilometers (km) northwest of Metro Manila, 110 km northwest of Subic Bay and 30 km north \nof  the  provincial  capital,  Iba.  The  plant  has  two  300  MW  generating  units,  which  were \nconstructed  in  phases  by  Mitsubishi  Corporation  of  Japan  under  turnkey  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contracts.  Each  unit  has  an  identical  drum-type  force \nrecirculation  boiler  supplied  by  Mitsubishi  Heavy  Industries  (MHI).  The  steam  turbine  and \ngenerator  systems  were  also  supplied  by  MHI  and  the  electrical  generators  were  supplied  by \nMitsubishi Electric. The plant\u2019s onsite facilities include storage tanks for fuel oil, potable and raw \nwater supply, a water-treatment plant, a coal stockyard, a coal crusher house, ash-handling and \nstorage facilities, and the central control building.  \n \n32. \nADB  provided  a  public  sector  loan  to  NPC  of  $197  million  approved  on  13  October \n199025 for the construction of unit 1, and another public sector loan of $162 million and a partial \ncredit  guarantee  of  Y12  billion  approved  on  2  November  199526  to  cover  additional  costs  of  \nunit  1,  construction  of  unit  2,  and  associated  transmission  facilities  and  activities.  Unit  1  was \ncompleted  at  a  total  cost  of  $520  million  and  began  commercial  operations  on  18  June  1998. \nUnit  2  was  completed  at  a  total  cost  of  $167  million  and  began  commercial  operations  on  \n10  December  1998.  The  plant  has  been  operated  to  date  by  NPC.  Power  from  the  plant  is \ntransmitted to Metro Manila through the northern Luzon transmission corridor. ADB conducted a \nproject  performance  audit  review  in  May  200227  and  concluded  that  the  construction  of  the \nMasinloc  plant  was  highly  relevant  to  help  address  the  country\u2019s  severe  power  shortages. \nAlthough implementation was delayed,28 the plant was seen as providing least-cost generation \nof electricity and at that time was deemed to be maintained in a satisfactory condition.  \n \n33.  More  recent  data,  however,  indicate  that  the  operating  performance  of  the  plant  has \ndeclined since 2001 because of inadequate maintenance and insufficient capital investments in \nanticipation  of  the  planned  privatization.  During  2001\u20132006,  utilization  of  the  Masinloc  plant \ndecreased from 76% to 45%. Almost none of its systems can operate at full capacity because of \npoor  maintenance.29  A  lack  of  spare  parts  is  a  major  concern  for  proper  maintenance  of  the \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB.  1990.

Manila. \n\n28 The  3.5  year  delay  was  largely  due  to  the  longer  than  expected  lead  time  for  land  acquisition.  While  the  actual \nconstruction  took  shorter  (39  months)  than  planned  (42  months),  the  full  output  of  unit  1  was  not  evacuated \nbecause of transmission line constraints. Unit 1 started to evacuate its output only in March 1999,  when the 500 \nkilovolt (kV) transmission facilities (financed by ADB and cofinanciers under the Northern Luzon Transmission and \nGeneration Project) were put into operation.  \n\n29 The  major  operational  problems  have  been  the  failure  of  the  ship  unloader,  coal  pulverizers,  boiler  feed  pumps, \n\nash handling system, and misalignment of the coal belt conveyor. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nplant. Unit 1 had a major overhaul in 2005 (the first since commercial operations began in 1998) \nbut there has been no major overhaul of unit 2. The plant\u2019s operations have been characterized \nby  low  capacity,  poor  availability,  low  reliability,  and  violations  of  environmental,  health,  and \nsafety  conditions.  The  plant\u2019s  emissions  are  unable  to  meet  dust  emission  limits  at  any  load. \nThe  Masinloc  operating  statistics  for  units  1  and  2  combined  for  1999\u20132006  are  presented  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nRehabilitation Plan \n\n34. \nUpon  takeover,  MPPC  plans  a  2-year  rehabilitation  of  the  plant.  The  current  capacity \nutilization is only 45%, but MPPC aims to raise the net output to 600 MW after the rehabilitation \nand to run the plant at 89% capacity utilization in ordinary years and 87% in major maintenance \nyears (every 6 years). MPPC is also confident that the heat rate can be improved. The plant\u2019s \nuseful life is 40 years upon acquisition and rehabilitation by MPPC. \n \n35. \nThe rehabilitation effort will focus on returning the existing plant systems to the original \nequipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications, particularly the environment-related components \nof the plant. The plant was originally properly engineered and constructed to meet technical and \nenvironmental  performance  requirements  and  there  is  little  technological  or  environmental \nperformance  risk  involved  in  returning  the  facility  to  its  OEM  specifications.  Major  plant \noperating repairs will be carried out on the safety devices and systems, the ash collection and \ntransport system, and the boiler feed pumps and forced circulation pump. Major OEMs including \nMHI  have  already  visited  the  Masinloc  plant  since  MPPC  won  the  bid.  More  details  on  the \nrehabilitation plan are contained in Appendix 3.  \n \nB. \n\nManagement and Ownership \n\n1. \n\nBorrower \n\n \n36.  MPPC  is  currently  indirectly  fully  owned  by  AES.  However,  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC) has proposed taking a 6% partnership interest in MPPC and AES also plans \nto sell at a later stage 25-30% of its shares in MPPC to a local partner still to be identified.  \n \n37.  MPPC  will  receive  commercial,  financial,  and  risk  management  support  from  AES \nPhilippines  Energy  Supply  Business  (APESB),  an  energy  marketing  company  established  by \nAES.  APESB  will  market  the  generation  from  Masinloc  under  bilateral  contracts  to  customers, \nincluding  distribution  utilities,  special  economic  zones,  electric  cooperatives,  and  large \ncommercial and industrial customers so Masinloc will not sell only to the spot market. APESB \nwill  consist  of  sales  and  marketing,  asset  optimization,  risk  management,  and  billing  and \nstatements teams. The sales and marketing team will oversee all activities related to the sales \nand  marketing  of  Masinloc\u2019s  dispatch.  The  asset  optimization  team  will  carry  out  trading, \nscheduling, fuel procurement, and contract structuring. \n \n\n2. \n\nSponsor \n\n \n38. \nAES  Corporation,  formed  in  1981,  is  a  Delaware  holding  company  whose  subsidiaries \noperate a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in 27 countries. It is one \nof the world\u2019s largest global power companies with 2006 revenues of $12.3 billion and 32,000 \nemployees.  AES  has  an  ownership  interest  in  assets  with  a  combined  generating  capacity  of \nover 43,000 MW. Its 13 distribution companies serve 11 million retail customers and had sales \nof  over  73,000  GWh  in  2006.  AES  is  listed  on  New  York  Stock  Exchange.  It  is  rated  BB-  by \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s and B1 by Moody\u2019s. Apart from generation and distribution, AES is engaged \nin  related  activities  that  include  alternative  energy  businesses  such  as  wind  generation,  the \nsupply of liquefied natural gas to targeted North American markets, greenhouse gas reduction \nactivities,  and  related  industries,  involving  environmental  issues  and  the  application  of  new \nenergy technologies.  \n \n39. \nIn  generation,  AES  is  engaged  in  both  contract  and  competitive  supply  businesses. \nAES\u2019s  contract  generation  businesses  own  and  operate  plants  that  sell  electricity  and  related \nproducts  to  utilities  or  other  wholesale  customers  under  long-term  contracts.  The  company's \ncontract  generation  facilities  generally  limit  its  exposure  to  commodity  price  risks,  electricity \nprice volatility, and often to volume risk by entering into power sales agreements of 5 years or \nlonger for 75% or more of its output capacity. AES\u2019s competitive supply (merchant generation) \nbusinesses  own  and  operate  plants  that  sell  electricity  to  wholesale  customers  in  competitive \nmarkets. These plants typically sell into local power pools under short-term contracts (less than \n5 years) or into daily spot markets. AES was one of the first entrants into the merchant power \nbusiness,  which  it  joined  in  1996.  This  part  of  AES\u2019s  business  now  consists  of  27  power \ngeneration  facilities  with  a  total  capacity  of  13,000  MW30  located  in  Argentina,  Colombia, \nHungary, Kazakhstan, Panama, United Kingdom, and USA (the list of all merchant power plants \nof  AES  is  in  Appendix  4).  The  merchant  power  business  comprises  about  32%  of  AES \nrevenues. AES manages merchant risks through various mechanisms, depending on the nature \nof the business and the markets in which the business is operating.  \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nAsset Purchase Agreement \n\n40.  MPPC  will  acquire  the  assets  of  the  plant  from  PSALM  under  an  asset  purchase \nagreement (APA) dated 26 July 2007. Under the APA, MPPC is required to pay at least 40% of \nthe purchase price upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, and following the payment \nof  such  portion  of  the  purchase  price  (the  closing  date)  will  be  granted  possession  of,  and \nassume  rights  and  liabilities  pertaining  to,  the  purchased  assets.  MPPC  will  obtain  title  to  the \npurchased assets upon the execution of the deed of absolute sale by PSALM, which PSALM is \nobliged  to  complete  within  30  days  from  the  payment  of  the  entire  purchase  price.  The \nremaining  60%  of  the  purchase  price  is  payable  over  a  period  of  7  years  in  14  semi-annual \ninstallments if MPPC opts to pay the purchase price in installments.  \n \nThe project site consists of onshore lands and foreshore lands. The plant stands on the \n41. \nonshore  lands  consisting  of  138  hectares  (ha)  of  \u201cleased  premises\u201d  and  11  ha  of  \u201creclaimed \nland\u201d. Coal-handling jetties and a discharge channel stand on 6 ha of \u201cforeshore lands\u201d. MPPC \nwill rent the leased premises from PSALM in accordance with the LLA. Under the APA, PSALM \nis obliged to acquire a transferable right (i.e., a rental right), title or ownership over the reclaimed \nland  that  will  enable  it  to  be  included  as  part  of  the  leased  premises  within  7  years  from  the \nclosing  date.  The  reclaimed  land  is  currently  in  the  public  domain  but  is  scheduled  to  be \nconverted  into  private  land  by  a  presidential  promulgation  and  acquired  by  PSALM.  Once \nPSALM acquires such transferable right or title, the reclaimed land will be included as part of the \nleased  premises  and  therefore  be  leased  to MPPC  under  the  LLA  and  can  be  included in  the \npurchase  option  exercisable  by  MPPC.  PSALM  is  also  obliged  under  the  APA  to  acquire  a \n                                                 \n30 While this capacity is located in countries with competitive electricity markets, not all of it is traded on a merchant \nbasis.  Like  the  Philippines\u2019  WESM,  these  markets  also  use  bilateral  contracts.  Of  AES\u2019s  total  capacity  of  13,000 \nMW, about 10,750 MW is sold under short-term PPAs (less than 5 years) or on a merchant basis, and the rest is \nsold under longer-term PPAs. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\ntransferable right over the foreshore lands within 7 years from the closing date. The foreshore \nlands are also in the public domain. Because they are natural resources, even PSALM cannot \nacquire  title  to  the  foreshore  lands.  The  foreshore  lands  will  continue  to  be  owned  by  the \nGovernment and will be leased to PSALM, upon which PSALM will sublease the lands for use \nby MPPC.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Lease Agreement \n\n42.  MPPC will lease the leased premises from PSALM under the LLA, dated 26 July 2007. \nMPPC can lease the site for 20 years, with an option to extend for the lesser of 10 years or the \nremaining corporate life of PSALM, upon mutual agreement. MPPC has the right to acquire the \nleased premises (except for the foreshore lands and with respect to the reclaimed lands, subject \nto PSALM including the reclaimed lands in the option) once PSALM completes the acquisition of \ntitle to the land.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPower Sales \n\n43. \nFor  the  Masinloc  plant,  NPC  has  executed  PPAs  with  12  customers  totaling  264  MW \nequivalent  of  supply  volume  (44%  of  total  stated  capacity).  These  PPAs  will  be  transferred  to \nMPPC  along  with  the  plant.  Electric  cooperatives  represent  75%  of  these  customers  and  the \nrest  are  special  economic  zones  and  industrial  parks.  In  terms  of  the  supply  volume,  33%  of \nthese contracts will expire within 2007, 51% in 2008, 6% in 2009, and 10% in 2010. AES plans \nto sell Masinloc\u2019s output both on a bilateral contract basis and in the spot market.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCoal Supply \n\n44. \nCurrently,  the  Masinloc  plant  is  fueled  by  coal  the  Government  buys  under  supply \ncontracts with Australia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). AES management believes \nsome  cost  reductions  could  be  made  immediately  by  simply  making  coal  supply  practices \nconform  to  AES\u2019s  global  norms.  Cost  reductions  would  not  only  improve  plant  profitability,  but \nshould be enough to drop Masinloc below other coal-fired plants in the merit order, giving it the \nability to bid less than other plants and dispatch considerably greater quantities of power than \npreviously.  MPPC\u2019s  coal  will  be  procured  by  APSEB,  which  will  coordinate  with  AES\u2019s  global \nfuel  procurement  teams  when  negotiating  with  global  coal  suppliers  in  order  to  achieve \ncompetitive terms.  \n \n\n5. \n\nTransmission \n\n45. \nThe Masinloc plant is connected to the transmission grid via an 89-km double-circuit 230 \nkilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  to  the  Labrador  substation.  Power  evacuation  from  Masinloc  is \npossible  via  four  major  transmission  corridors.31  The  total  combined  capacity  of  these  four \n\n                                                 \n31 These are (i) the 500 kV double-circuit Labrador\u2014San Manuel\u2014San Jose transmission line, (ii) the 230 kV single-\ncircuit  Labrador\u2014Botolan\u2014Hermosa\u2014Balintawak  transmission  line,  (iii)  the  230  kV  mostly  single-circuit  San \nManuel\u2014Pantabangan\u2014Cabanatuan\u2014Mexico\u2014Balintawak  transmission  line,  and  (iv)  230  kV  single-circuit  San \nManuel\u2014Conception\u2014Mexico\u2014Talintawak  transmission  line.  Of  these,  (i)  was  financed  by  ADB  (ADB.  1995. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the National Power \nCorporation  and  a  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Northern  Luzon \nTransmission and Generation Project in the Republic of the Philippines and a Proposed Guarantee of a Bond issue \nby the National Power to Provide Cofinancing for the Project. Manila) and the upgrade of (ii) is being financed by \nADB (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe  National  Power  Corporation  for  the  Electricity  Market  and  Transmission  Development  Project  and  Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Republic of the Philippines for the Transition to Competitive Electricity Market. Manila). \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\ncorridors is 6,100 megavolt-ampere (MVA) and they allow the Masinloc plant to dispatch its full \nload to the grid. No transmission constraints are expected. \n \n\n6. \n\nOperation and Maintenance \n\nFollowing its normal practice, AES will operate the plant in-house, with technical support \n\n46. \nfrom its central engineering department as necessary.  \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Aspects \n\nThe Masinloc plant is located within Barangay Bani, in the municipality of Masinloc,32 a \n47. \nsite that has been zoned as industrial by the Government. The project site consists of 149 ha of \nonshore and reclaimed lands and 6 ha of foreshore lands. Onsite plant facilities include storage \ntanks for fuel oil, potable and raw water supply, a water-treatment plan, coal stockyard, and coal \ncrusher  house,  ash-handling  and  storage  facilities,  and  the  central  control  building.  Offshore \nfacilities include coal-handling jetties and a discharge channel. \n \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\n48.  When ADB processed its loan to unit 1 of the plant in 1990, there was no environmental \ncategorization  system  in  place.  NPC,  in  coordination  with  Electric  Power  Development \nCompany of Japan, prepared the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for both units in 1990. \nADB  assisted  NPC  in  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  management  plan  and  system \nthrough  technical  assistance.33  When  ADB  processed  its  loan  to  unit  2  in  1995,  the  plant  was \nassigned environmental category A based on a review of the original EIA and the environmental \nissues and mitigation measures for unit 1, which was then under construction. \n \n49. \nIn acquiring the plant, MPPC carried out an environmental performance audit through a \nconsulting  firm,  Environmental  Resources  Management  (ERM).  ERM  identified  significant \nenvironmental issues, related to (i) air emissions; (ii) wastewater, (iii) storm water and drainage; \n(iv) materials handling and storage; (v) waste management; (vi) marine ecological impacts; and \n(vii) contaminated groundmass. An ADB due diligence mission visited the site and confirmed the \nERM findings that the proposed rehabilitation measures reflected extensive maintenance needs, \nranging  from  replacement  of  much  needed  spares  to  an  overhaul  of  plant  grounds  and \nequipment.  Based  on  ERM\u2019s  findings,  ADB  and  MPPC  have  agreed  that  the  following  areas \nneed to be addressed urgently: (i) the electrostatic precipitator (to reduce the particulate matter \nemissions);  (ii)  wastewater  and  stormwater  collection  and  treatment;  and  (iii)  the  ash \nmanagement  system.  MPPC  has  prepared  corrective  action  plans  for  these  areas  and  these \nhave  been  accepted  by  ADB.  In  addition,  MPPC  commits  generally  to  bring  the  environment, \nhealth,  and  safety  aspects  of  the  plant  up  to  AES\u2019s  rigorous  global  standards.  AES  will  apply \nkey  environmental  standards  for  air  emissions  and  wastewater  discharges  following  national \nand World Bank standards. Masinloc will be required to implement the AES safety management \nsystem  and  to  comply  with  AES  safety  standards.  It  will  also  be  audited  within  12  months  of \n                                                 \n32 The land uses surrounding the site comprise: to the north, agricultural plantations, informal rural communities, and \nthe Lauis River about 1 km from the site; to the east, rural communities and National Highway 3 about 1 km from \nthe site; to the south, Oyon Bay, which is a fish sanctuary and a protected area; and to the west, the South China \nSea. About 11 ha of land at the edge of the southern part of the site was reclaimed, reportedly using land based \nsoils excavated locally. \n\n33 This technical assistance involved establishing an environmental baseline monitoring system for impacts during the \noperational  phase;  upgrading  NPC\u2019s  in-house  capacity  for  environmental  management;  developing  a  strategy  for \nfly ash utilization; examining the possibility of reducing oil dependence by rehabilitating and converting existing oil-\nfired units to coal-fired units.   \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ntakeover  by  MPPC  and  at  least  once  in  3  years  subsequently  as  part of  the  AES  safety  audit \nprogram.  Implementation  by  AES  of  the  environmental  management  plan,  including  the \ncorrective action plans, will be monitored throughout the life of the ADB financing. \n \nBased on the field visit, the review of the environment performance audit report, and the \n50. \ncorrective  action  plans,  ADB  has  classified  the  proposed  Project  as  category  B.  The \nrehabilitation work by MPPC aims to bring the plant\u2019s operating and environmental performance \nback to the original design standards and does not involve any expansion or additional facilities. \nIt  will  improve  the  operating  efficiency,  save  coal,  reduce  carbon  dioxide  and  other \nenvironmental  emissions,  and  increase  the  health  and  safety  standards  of  the  plant.  The \nenvironmental  performance  audit  report  and  the  corrective  action  plans  are  regarded  as \nconstituting  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  is  scheduled  to  be  posted  on  the \nAsian Development Bank website on about 3 December 2007.  \n \n51. \nThe  Masinloc  plant  was  accorded  an  environmental  clearance  by  the  Government  in \n1992  based  on  the  original  EIA.  The  Government  has  informed  MPPC  that  no  further  EIA  or \nenvironmental clearance is required before it takes over the physical assets, conducts extensive \nmaintenance  measures,  and  operates  the  plant.  MPPC  still  needs  to  obtain  or  periodically \nrenew certain routine and readily available environmental permits, including a permit to operate \nair pollution source and control installations, an offshore lease permit, and a reclamation permit. \nMPPC  will  regularly  submit  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the  Department  of  the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Aspects \n\n52. \nIndigenous Peoples. The Project has been categorized C with respect to its impacts on \nindigenous peoples. While Zambales is home to two indigenous groups, there are no people at \nthe  plant  site.  No  ancestral  domain  claims  have  been  reported  for  the  lands  occupied  by  the \nplant and at the resettlement sites.  \n \n53. \nInvoluntary  Resettlement.  The  Project  has  been  categorized  C  with  respect  to  the \ninvoluntary resettlement. The Project will not involve any land acquisition, change in land use, or \naccess restriction. The plant site is fenced and there are no settlers inside the property. Before \nconstruction  of  the  Masinloc  plant,  the  plant  area,  consisting  primarily  of  coastal  community \nholdings,  was  planted  with  mangoes,  paddy,  and  minor  agricultural  produce.  In  June  1996, \nabout 2 years before the commissioning of the plant, NPC, in collaboration with the municipality \nof Masinloc, completed the relocation of 198 families living at the plant site. 105 families were \nrelocated to a resettlement site in Barangay Taltal, 1.5 km away from their original settlement, \nand 93 families opted for self-relocation. A total budget of $25.75 million was allocated to these \nactivities.  In  2002,  an  ADB  operations  evaluation  mission  identified  some  unresolved  issues, \nwhich were (i) disputes over compensation amounts and delayed transfer of land ownership, (ii) \nsaline  drinking  water  at  the  resettlement  site,  and  (iii)  limited  job  opportunities  for  project \naffected families.  \n \nNPC has been working to resolve these issues. Compensation has now been paid to all \n54. \nbut  one  claimant  (for  whom  final  payment  is  being  negotiated).  The  relocated  families  in \nBarangay Taltal received certificates of award for a 6 x 3 meter (m) housing unit on a 200 m2 \nhome  lot.  The  judicial  titling  process  for  the  ownership  of  resettlement  lands  is  still  ongoing. \nWhen the titling process has been completed, NPC will formally attach titles to the certificates of \naward. Marked improvements to the housing units and significant job creation were observed at \nthe relocation site during the due diligence mission. The following civil works were carried out at \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nthe  relocation  site:  (i)  construction  of  a  seawall  (riprapping)  and  a  concrete  pavement;  (ii) \nrehabilitation of the water supply system; (iii) installation of water lines and a concrete cover for \nthe  existing  canal;  (iv)  procurement  of  school  equipment  and  construction  of  the  concrete \nperimeter  fence;  (v)  construction  of  a  multi-purpose  hall  for  senior  citizens,  a  day  care  center \nand a health center; and (vi) installation of streetlights at the relocation site.  \n \n55.  When it takes over the plant, MPPC will support continued implementation of community \ndevelopment  activities  in  line  with  AES  policy  to  support  sustainable  business  practices in  the \ncommunities  in  which  it  operates.  In  particular,  MPPC  will  work  closely  with  the  multipartite \nmonitoring  committee  (MPMC)  comprising  representatives  of  regulatory  agencies,  local \ngovernment  entities,  and  NPC,  to  ensure  that  the  Masinloc  plant  continues  to  support  local \ncommunities.  Under  the  APA,  MPPC  is  committed  to  adhere  to  the  2005  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  (MOA)  signed  by  PSALM,  NPC,  and  representatives  of  local  governments. \nUnder  the  MOA,  MPPC  as  the  owner  of  a  privatized  plant  will  recognize,  support,  and  fully \ncooperate  with  MPMC  to  monitor  Masinloc  plant\u2019s  compliance  with  environmental  compliance \ncertificate  conditions  and  to  address  the  social  and  environmental  concerns  of  the  people  of \nMasinloc  and  Zambales.  MPPC  will  give  priority  employment  to  qualified  local  residents,  give \nthe  municipality  of  Masinloc  preference,  if  qualified,  in  awards  of  plant-related  contracts,  and \nstrictly observe and comply with its obligations to provide financial benefits to host communities \nas  required  by  the  regulations.34  Furthermore,  MPPC  will  implement  and  devise  new  socio-\neconomic projects and public health monitoring along with annual medical, dental, and surgical \nmissions. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Impact35 \n\n56. \nThe  Project  aims  to  promote  Philippines\u2019  sustainable  economic  development  by \nproviding  revenues  to  the  Government,  improving  the  reliability,  and  reducing  the  cost  of  the \nelectricity supply; and improving the investment climate. The acquisition and rehabilitation of the \nMasinloc plant (outputs) will improve operational efficiency and raise the environmental, health, \nand safety standards of an underutilized and poorly-maintained power plant to global standards \n(outcome). The Project will further the privatization of the Philippine power sector and result in a \nreliable  and  competitively-priced  electricity  supply  that  imposes  a  limited  fiscal  burden  on  the \nGovernment  (impact).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  development  effectiveness \nframework are in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n34 Under  EPIRA  and  DOE  Energy  Regulations  (ER)  No.  1-94,  generation  facilities  owned  by  NPC  transferred  to \nPSALM  and  subsequently  privatized  are  required  to  provide  a  P0.01/kWh  financial  benefit  to  host  communities. \nFurther,  as  per  Republic  Act  9136  and  ER  1-94,  P0.0025/kWh  of  the  total  electricity  sales  will  be  allocated  as \nDevelopment and Livelihood Fund for the resettlement areas. \n\n35 The  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  in  terms  of  its  contribution  to  private  sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for  implementing  the  Good \nPractice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup of multilateral development banks. \n\n\f \n\nF. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n17\n\n57. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  The  Project  is  anticipated  to  provide  a  net \nbenefit  to  the  economy  by  reducing  the  national  debt,  replacing  current  generation  with  more \nefficient and environmentally-sound generation, adding new generation capacity, and increasing \nthe overall competitiveness of the sector, resulting in lower electricity tariffs in the long term. The \nreduction in the national debt is assumed to be the difference between MPPC\u2019s payment for the \nassets and the depreciated economic value of the assets, adjusted for financing of the Project \nfrom  domestic  sources.  Part  of  the  electricity  output  from  the  Project  will  replace  electricity \nalready  generated  by  Masinloc  (the  nonincremental  portion)  but  the  Project  enable  this  to  be  \ngenerated  in  a  more  efficient  manner.  The  remaining  output  will  be  new  generation  stemming \nfrom the implementation of MPPC\u2019s rehabilitation plan (the incremental portion). The benefit for \nthe  nonincremental  portion  is  the  opportunity  cost  the  economy  \u201csaves\u201d  by  not  having  to  use \nmore  expensive  electricity  generated  by  less  efficient  plants.  For  the  incremental  portion,  the \nbenefit is calculated by valuing the additional electricity output from the Project at the projected \nWESM  spot  price.  This  market  price  reflects  the  consumers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  additional \nelectricity,  and  hence  is  a  good  approximation  of  the  benefit  to  the  economy  of  Masinloc\u2019s \nadded  electricity  generation.  Environmental  benefits  are  also  expected  from  the  Project  but \nthese have not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n58. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) under the ADB base case was estimated at \n24.1%,  which  is  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%.  Testing  this  under  four  adverse \nscenarios demonstrates that the Project is economically robust and viable.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\n60. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n59. \nThe  proposed  ADB  assistance  is  a  direct  loan  of  up  to  $200  million  to  MPPC  without \ngovernment  guarantee.  Upon  or  after disbursement  of the  loan,  part of it  may be converted, at \nMPPC\u2019s option, to pesos for a period which could be up to the maturity of the loan.  \n \nB. \n\nJustification  \n\nThe Project merits ADB support for the following reasons.  \n\nIt  will  further  the  privatization  efforts  of  the  Government  to  promote  competition \nand  efficiency  in  the  power  sector  and  to  put  the  sector  on  sounder  financial \nfooting.  It  will  bring  the  percentage  of  NPC\u2019s  privatized  eligible  assets  to  25%, \nand this will increase to 39% once the Calaca sale is complete. The Project will \nbring in a new market player without vested interests and diversify the generation \nmarket.  While  the  electricity  market  is  projected  to  continue  behaving  in  an \noligopolistic manner initially, anticipated increases in the number of players in the \nmarket (through privatization, appointment of independent administrators for IPP \nplants,  and  new  entrants)  will  increase  competition  and  as  a  result  electricity \nprices will tend toward the long run marginal cost. Proceeds from the sale of the \nMasinloc plant will be used to reduce NPC\u2019s stranded debt. \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nThe Project will improve the operating efficiency of the plant and bring the plant\u2019s \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  standards  up  to  global  standards.  The \nMasinloc plant is currently underutilized and violates environmental regulations. \n\nThe Project will embody ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupporting  energy  infrastructure  development  with  private  sector  participation. \nThe  Project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development, \nprivate  sector  development,  good  governance,  and  environmental  protection. \nThe Project will directly complement the Power Sector Development Program by \ncatalyzing  privatization  of  an  NPC-owned  power  plant  and  bringing  in  sales \nrevenues  to  the  Government.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  improve  the \ninvestment  climate  by  increasing  the  reliability  of  generating  capacity  for  the \ncountry\u2019s economic center. Successful acquisition and operation of the plant by a \nreputed \ninduce \nforeign  private  sector  will  boost  market  confidence  and \nsubsequent foreign investment.  \n\nADB\u2019s involvement in the Project will catalyze long-term private sector equity and \ndebt.  \n\nThe  ADB  loan  will  have  a  long  tenor  to  ease  the  Project\u2019s  cash  flow  and  to \nmitigate  the  foreign  exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  fluctuation  risk.  In  the  long \nterm,  local-currency,  fixed-rate  financing  will  enhance  the  sustainability  and \naffordability  of  the  Project  and  reduce  the  mismatch  between  the  currency  of \nborrowing and the currency of revenues.  \n\n \nAnticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n\nC. \n\n61. \nAES was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended todate) and policy \nrelating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require MPPC \nto  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international \nbest practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities \nor the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \nThe financing documentation between ADB and MPPC will further allow ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n\n62. \nThe  proposed  direct  loan  will,  once  approved,  increase  ADB's  group  exposure  to  the \nAES Group to $214 million, ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign exposure to the Philippines to 7.2% and \nthat  to  the  conventional  energy  generation  (other  than  hydropower)  subsector  to  16.8%.  The \nproposed  financing  is  within  ADB\u2019s  aggregate,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  exposure \nlimits for non-sovereign investment.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n63. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernment  of  the  Philippines  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the \nproposed  assistance  to  MPPC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nconfirmation. ADB will enter into suitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, following approval of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n64. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the proposed loan to Masinloc Power Partners Company Limited for the acquisition and \nrehabilitation of the Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant of up to $200,000,000 funded from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n29 November 2007 \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n\f \n\n \n\nInvestment \nNo. \n\n7008 \n \n7020/885 \n7025 \n7036 \n7043/0991 \n\n7059 \n7064 \n7065/1065 \n7069/1085 \n7071/1093 \n7071/1093 \n7089/1230 \n7090/1231 \n7092/1252 \n7092/1252 \n7095/1263 \n7106 \n7107 \n7107 \n7125 \n7145/1614 \n7145/1616 \n7145 \n7154/1696 \n7155/1722 \n\n7162/1769 \n7191/2077 \n7193 \n7206 \n\n \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES \n($\u2019000) \n \nOrdinary \nCapital \nResources\n \n\nEquity and \nLine of \nInvestment\n\nComplementary \nLoan \n\nGuarantee \n\nCompany \n\n \n\n2\n0\n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n0.495 \n0.351 \n \n2.500 \n0.370 \n1.100 \n\n4.000 \n0.536 \n\n \n\n0.659 \n\n10.000 \n3.000 \n0.300 \n0.900 \n3.000 \n2.892 \n0.031 \n0.019 \n3.850 \n2.842 \n\nPlanters Development Bank \n \nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Co. \nH&Q Philippine Ventures \nPlanters DB Leasing Corp. \nMirant Navotas Corp.

Masinloc  600  MW  Coal-Fired  Power  Plant  Independent  Technical  Assessment  Report. \nSingapore (11 October). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nREHABILITATION PLAN FOR THE MASINLOC POWER PLANT \n\n \n1. \nThe 600 MW pulverized-coal electric generation facility in Masinloc, the Philippines, has \nbeen  systematically  deteriorating  since  2004  because  of  the  inability  of  the  plant  personnel  to \nprocure  spare  parts  and/or  perform  equipment  repairs.  The  current  management  has  not \napproved  funds  for  parts  and/or  repairs,  so  plant  personnel  have  been  forced  to  maintain \noperations  with  whatever  resources  are  at  hand.  Spare  parts  have  been  depleted  and  critical \nequipment essential to reliable plant operation cannot be repaired.  \n \n2. \nThe  plant  refurbishment  effort  by  Masinloc  Power  Partners  Company  Limited  (MPPC), \nthe  new  owner  of  the  plant,  will  focus  on  returning  the  existing  plant  systems  to  the  original \nequipment  manufacturer  (OEM)  specification.  The  facility  was  originally  properly  engineered \nand  constructed  to  meet  environmental  and  technical  performance  requirements  and  there  is \nlittle technological or environmental performance risk involved in returning the facility to its OEM \nspecifications.  Replacement  equipment  lead  times  and  the  availability  of  equipment  technical \nspecialists have been studied carefully as a part of the refurbishment effort. \n \n3. \nThe major plant operating repairs will be completed for three critical systems as soon as \npractical upon the take over by MPPC. These are: (i) identification and repair of safety devices \nand \nand  \n(iii) repair or replacement of the boiler feed water feed pump and forced circulation pump. Coal \nship unloading facilities and reclaimers will be repaired as soon as the facility is transferred to \nMPPC.  The  current  condition  of  these  systems  is  causing  extreme  delays  in  unloading  ships, \nresulting  in  excessive  demurrage  charges  as  well  as  the  loss  of  coal  to  uncontrolled \nspontaneous combustion.
