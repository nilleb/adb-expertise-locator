I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan, \nwithout government guarantee, to Masinloc Power Partners Company Limited (MPPC) for the \nacquisition and rehabilitation of the Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant (Project).  \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  The 600 megawatt (MW) Masinloc coal-fired power plant is one of the generation assets \nof the National Power Corporation (NPC) of the Philippines targeted for privatization (with a \ncombined capacity of 4,336 MW). NPC is a state-owned vertically integrated electricity utility, \nwhich has now been unbundled. The Masinloc plant was constructed in the 1990s with public \nsector loans from Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Export-Import Bank of Japan (now \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation).  \n \n3.  On 26 June 2001, Republic Act No. 9136, otherwise known as the Electric Power \nIndustry  Reform  Act  of  2001  (EPIRA),  became  law.  EPIRA  provides  the  legal  basis  and \nframework for restructuring the Philippine electricity sector. The goals of the restructuring under \nEPIRA are to promote competition and efficiency in the sector in order to reduce power rates, \nimprove nationwide electrification levels, enhance the inflow of private capital, and broaden the \nownership base of the power generation, transmission, and distribution sectors so they can \nmeet projected increases in the demand for power. EPIRA created the Power Sector Assets \nand Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) to privatize certain generating assets of NPC. \nEPIRA\u2019s target was to privatize 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible capacity in Luzon and Visayas by June \n2004, but to date only eight hydropower plants, with a combined capacity of 475 MW, have \nbeen auctioned off for $664 million (11% of the eligible capacity).1  \n \n4.  The original intention was for the Masinloc plant to be the first major facility to be \nprivatized and the plant was put out to an international tender in December 2004. The bid was \nwon by YNN Pacific Consortium, a joint venture between YNN Holdings of the Philippines and \nthe Australia-based Great Pacific Financial Group, for $562 million. However, in the absence of \npower  purchase  agreements  and  a  perceived  uncertainty  in  the  regulatory  and  market \nenvironment, YNN was unable to secure financing even for the down payment of 40% of the \nacquisition price and the bid was declared a failure in August 2006.2 The 600 MW Calaca coal-\nfired power plant was also put out to a tender in April 2006 but that tender also failed.3  \n \n5.  With one year\u2019s operating track record of the wholesale electricity spot market (WESM), \nthe Masinloc plant was again put out to tender in July 2007. There were six bidders4 and AES \nCorporation  (AES)  of  the  United  States,  through  its  subsidiary  Masinloc  Power  Partners \n                                                 \n1  The first five of these were small plants, the sixth was a 112 MW plant, and the seventh was the 360 MW Magat \nplant, acquired in April 2007 by SN Aboitiz Power, a joint venture between SN Power Invest of Norway and Aboitiz \nEquity Venture of the Philippines. A long-term debt of $380 million was arranged for Magat with International \nFinance Corporation, Nordic Investment Bank, and other foreign and local banks in October 2007. \n2  Apart from YNN, First Generation Holdings was the only other bidder. \n3  The Calaca bid was declared a failure because the best offer ($177 million) did not meet the reserve price ($288 \nmillion). Although Calaca had a power purchase agreement for 100 MW, this was not enough to ensure a higher \nbid.  \n4  Other bidders were: First Generation Holdings of the Philippines, Ranhill of Malaysia, Suez-Tractebel of Belgium, \nInternational Power of the United Kingdom, and Shenhua of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n ", "2   \nCompany Limited (MPPC), won the award at $930 million.5 Since the announcement of the \nsecond tender of the Masinloc plant, ADB was approached by several of the bidders with regard \nto financial assistance. In anticipation of a request for financial assistance from the winning \nbidder, ADB circulated a draft concept clearance paper for interdepartmental comments on 16 \nJuly 2007. When the winning bid was announced and MPPC confirmed its interest in receiving \nfinancial support, the concept clearance paper was finalized and approved by Management on \n13 August 2007.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Power Sector \n1.  Demand and Supply \n6.  The Philippine power system is divided into three major grids: Luzon, Visayas, and \nMindanao. The Luzon grid, with a total installed capacity of 12,092 MW, is the largest of the \nthree and accounts for 73% of the demand. The largest load center in the country is the Metro \nManila area, representing close to 65% of national electricity sales. The Philippine system is \nrelatively well diversified in terms of the fuel sources (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Installed Capacity in the Philippines and Luzon by Fuel Source in 2006 \n \n \nInstalled Capacity in  Installed Capacity \nFuel  %  % \nthe Philippines (MW)  in Luzon (MW) \nCoal  4,177  26  3,769  31 \nDiesel/oil  3,602  23  2,333  19 \nHydro  3,257  21  2,247  19 \nNatural gas  2,763  17  2,763  23 \nGeothermal  1,978  13  954  8 \nNonconventional  26  0  25  0 \nTotal  15,803  100  12,092  100 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Department of Energy, Power Statistics.  \n \n7.  In terms of the ownership, the Government\u2019s share (plants owned by NPC) is low at 26% \nwith  74%  owned  by  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  and  others  (Table  2).  However, \neffective control over many IPP assets lies with NPC or Meralco because of the power purchase \nagreements (PPAs) that they have with NPC or Meralco. \n                                                 \n5  There was a second tender for Calaca in October 2007 and this was won by Suez-Tractebel for $787 million over \ntwo other bidders, AES and First Generation Holdings. Once the Masinloc and Calaca sales are complete, PSALM \nwill have successfully bid out 10 of the 31 plants identified for privatization. This translates to 1,681 MW in capacity, \nor 39% of the 4,336 MW total capacity of all NPC plants in Luzon and the Visayas.

In 2006, the dependable capacity in Luzon (10,576 MW) exceeded the peak demand \n(6,728 MW) by 57% and the required capacity6 (8,302 MW) by 22%.7 The Department of Energy \n(DOE), however, estimates that energy consumption in Luzon will increase at an average rate of \n4.0% per annum. Given the retirement of two major power plants8 scheduled in 2009\u20132010 and \nthe construction of only 38 MW of committed projects, DOE projects that the Luzon grid will \nneed about 1,950 MW of additional generating capacity by 2014 (Table 3). If no additional \ncapacity comes onstream,9 the critical period in the Luzon grid will be in 2011 when the reserve \nmargin falls below the required level. DOE estimates that roughly P71.0 billion ($1.7 billion) is \nneeded to finance the additional capacity required in Luzon.  \n \nTable 3: Supply and Demand Projection in Luzon 2006\u20132014 (MW) \n \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014 \nCommitted \nCapacity  0  0  8  30  0  0  0  0  0 \nAddition \nRetiring \n0  0  0  0  100  650  0  0  0 \nCapacity \nDependable \n10,576  10,576  10,576  10,584  10,514  9,864  9,864  9,864  9,864 \nCapacity (DC) \nPeak  Demand \n6,728  6,981  7,252  7,552  7,878  8,225  8,596  8,990  9,397 \n(PD) \nSurplus \n3,848  3,595  3,324  3,032  2,636  1,639  1,268  874  467 \n(S=DC-PD) \nReserve Margin \n57%  52%  46%  40%  34%  20%  15%  10%  5% \n(S/PD) \nRequired \nCapacity  8,302  8,614  8,949  9,319  9,721  10,150  10,607  11,093  11,596 \n(PDx123.4%) \nIndicative \nCapacity  0  0  0  0  150  450  450  600  600 \nRequirement \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Department of Energy modified by Asian Development Bank staff to highlight key points. \n                                                 \n6  Required capacity refers to the peak demand plus the reserve margin approved by the Energy Regulatory \nCommission above the peak demand of 23.4%, consisting of a 2.8% load following and frequency regulation, \n10.3% spinning reserve, and 10.3% back-up. \n7  However, the net reserve margin computed from the actual available capacity was less than the reported reserve \nmargin after adjusting for hydropower capacity and fuel supply and transmission constraints. \n8  The power plants scheduled for retirement are Hopewell gas turbine power plant (dependable capacity of 100 MW) \nand the Malaya oil thermal power plants (dependable capacity of 650 MW). \n9  The Power Development Plan assumes that roughly 1,750 MW from three power plants will be commissioned by \n2009\u20132010. This remains indicative as construction has not started on any of the plants (San Gabriel, Ilijan gas-\nfired expansion, and GN Power coal-fired).  ", "4   \n2.  Regulation \n9.  From  1993  to  2001,  the  Energy  Regulatory  Board  (ERB)  regulated  NPC  and  the \ndistribution  utilities.  Under  the  EPIRA,  industry  regulation  became  the  responsibility  of  the \nEnergy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC).  New  functions  and  responsibilities  have  been \nintroduced, including: (i) developing and enforcing technical standards for transmission and \ndistribution; (ii) enforcing WESM rules; (iii) licensing generators and suppliers of electricity; (iii) \nsetting a retail tariff for non-contestable sectors of the industry; (iv) determining and approving \nthe level of the universal charge; (v) preventing abuse of market power and anti-competitive or \ndiscriminatory behavior by industry participants; and (vi) resolving disputes between industry \nparticipants or between industry participants and customers.  \n \n10.  Since the beginning of WESM, apart from the tariff of NPC-owned plants under bilateral \ncontracts, wholesale tariffs are no longer regulated. Retail tariffs are still regulated. Following \nthe passing of EPIRA, the retail tariff was unbundled and all distribution utilities are required to \nfile  a  petition  with  the  ERC  for  the  approval  of  unbundled  rates.  In  the  unbundled  rates, \ngeneration, transmission, distribution, supply, and universal charges10 are separately itemized \non a customer bill and a change in a component is treated as a pass-through (although ERC \napproval  is  required  to  before  the  change  can  be  reflected  in  customer  bills).  While  rate \nunbundling was intended to be technically revenue neutral, the process has effectively involved \na review of existing costs, and distribution rates have been revised (downward for some utilities) \nas a result.  \n \n11.  The distribution business is still a largely regulated natural monopoly, and most retail \nusers can purchase power only from distributors. Generators can sell only to either distribution \nutilities or to special economic zones. Distribution utilities may be private-investor-owned utilities \n(IOUs),  electric  cooperatives,  or  local  government  utilities.  IOUs  account  for  77%  of  total \nelectricity  sales  with  the  remainder  coming  largely  from  electric  cooperatives.  The  largest \ndistribution  utility  in  terms  of  sales  is  Manila  Electricity  Company  (Meralco).  When  retail \ncompetition  is  implemented  (expected  about  2011  or  later),  the  retail  tariff  to  contestable \ncustomers11 will cease to be regulated. \n \n3.  Issues and Sector Reform \n12.  High Electricity Price. Electricity in the Philippines is among the most expensive in the \nworld. Given excess capacity, efficient generation prices should approximate the fuel costs of \nthe marginal generator. In power markets that do not levy differential environmental taxes on \ndifferent fuel sources, direct cost considerations would dictate that gas plants be utilized to meet \npeak demand, while base load be met by coal, hydropower, or geothermal power, since these \nare the plants with lower economic fuel costs. Given that 60% of the installed capacity in the \n                                                 \n10 The universal charge is a component of the retail tariff that is meant to recover (i) environmental protection costs, \n(ii) rural electrification costs, and (iii) NPC\u2019s \u201cstranded costs\u201d (i.e., the take-or-pay capacity payments under the \nPPAs) and \u201cstranded debt\u201d. Currently, the universal charge is set to cover the first two components only. Spot \nelectricity price data suggest that the generation cost component of the retail tariff incorporates part of the stranded \ncosts of NPC. However, the stranded debt is not reflected in any component of the tariff.  \n11 Contestable customers will be initially defined as those end-users with a monthly average peak consumption of at \nleast 1 MW. Under open access, contestable customers are allowed to choose their electricity supplier, who buys \nor generates the electricity, which distribution utilities will be compelled to deliver over their lines. End-users will pay \nthe distribution and transmission companies all other incidental charges at regulated rates. Over time, the definition \nof contestable customers will gradually be expanded to include smaller consumers, ultimately extending to the \nhousehold level. Uncontestable customers are end-users that must still buy power from the generator or supplier \ntheir local distribution utility chooses to contract with.  ", " \n5\nPhilippines  is  coal,  hydropower,  and  geothermal,  one  would  expect  gas  plants  to  be  the \nmarginal generator. However, the opposite is occurring: most gas-fired power plants in the \nPhilippines are base-loaded and coal plants are on the margin most of the time. Further, \nelectricity prices are much higher than the cost of generation. Operating and price data show \nthat the Philippine power prices are determined by institutional and financial arrangements, not \neconomic forces. \n \n13.  Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are the main driver of high electricity costs in the \nPhilippines. Power generation and transmission was a virtual monopoly for NPC until the power \ncapacity  shortage  in  the  early  1990s  forced  the  Government  to  enter  into  contractual \narrangements with independent power producers (IPPs). The Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) \nLaw  provided  the  legal  mandate  and  paved  the  way  for  NPC  and  eventually  for  private \ndistribution utilities to source power from IPPs through PPAs. PPAs continued to be signed even \nafter the power crisis was resolved in 1993, as NPC built excess reserves in light of positive \neconomic growth projections. However the Asian financial crisis suppressed economic growth \nand reduced electricity demand, leading to a significant surplus of power generating capacity, \nespecially in Luzon. Installed capacity nationwide reached 15,803 MW in 2006 against the peak \ndemand of 10,749 MW. Installed capacity in Luzon was 12,092 MW in 2006 against the peak \ndemand of 6,728 MW. Today, there are 61 IPPs in total, representing 72% of the total installed \ncapacity of the country. Of these, 35 IPPs (8,141 MW) have PPAs with NPC, and 3 IPPs (2,304 \nMW) have PPAs with Manila Electric Company (Meralco) with varying tenor and take-or-pay \nlevels.12 About 53% of installed capacity nationwide is subject to PPAs with take-or-pay clauses \nthat cover at least 73% of capacity for the next 15 years or so.  \n \n14.  The PPAs exert three distinct upward pressures on prices. First, take-or-pay capacity \npayments to IPPs imply that the nonfuel costs of electricity must be recovered even when power \nis not being generated. NPC and distribution utilities such as Meralco are largely permitted to \ncover their take-or-pay liabilities by passing these costs on to the end users.13 Second, the PPA \nprices are high by industry standards.14 Third, and less widely recognized, the PPAs and cross-\nownership of generation and distribution severely distort the fuel mix, so that higher-cost gas \nplants are frequently run while lower cost plants (coal, geothermal, and hydropower) sit idle.  \n \n15.  Sector Reform. To lower the electricity price, the Government embarked on market-\noriented reform program and in June 2001 EPIRA became law. The reform plan embodied in \nEPIRA mandated a radical restructuring and includes the following actions: \n \n(i)  creation of PSALM to take ownership of and manage the orderly privatization of \nNPC\u2019s generation and transmission assets; \n(ii)  creation of WESM to provide competition in the wholesale electricity market; \n(iii)  abolition of ERB and the creation of a more robust and more independent ERC \nwith the power to set tariffs in the noncompetitive transmission and distribution \n                                                 \n12 Others IPPs either have PPAs with other buyers or sell on a merchant basis.  \n13 NPC\u2019s obligations arising from these PPAs amounted to P596 billion in 2005, representing more than half of its \nP1.07 trillion total liabilities. NPC\u2019s total liabilities account for about a third of the country\u2019s public sector debt, and \nP200 billion of these liabilities have already been absorbed by the Government. \n14 The initial PPAs were negotiated when the country was facing severe power shortages, which explains the higher \nprices; however, the same cannot be the case for the more recently negotiated PPAs. PSALM has renegotiated the \nPPA price with 25 of the 35 IPP contracts as of May 2007 with six having expired during the renegotiation process \nand four left to be finalized. One PPA was cancelled because the associated plant was never built. These \nrenegotiations and the cancellation resulted in about $1.03 billion worth of total avoided costs (or reduction in \nstranded contract costs) in present value terms. However, the net impact on electricity prices was minimal and only \nlimited relief was achieved.  ", "6   \nsubsectors and with wide-ranging powers to regulate the behavior of participants \nin all sectors of the industry; and  \n(iv)  development, subject to certain conditions, of competition in the retail supply of \nelectricity, starting with large electricity users and eventually extending to the \nsupply of electricity to the household level.  \n \n16.  After 6 years of EPIRA, the power sector is still struggling to implement these changes \nas described below. \n \n17.  Generation Assets. In the generation sector, PSALM\u2019s original target for power plant \nprivatization was to have 70% of NPC\u2019s eligible assets in Luzon and Visayas (totalling 4,336 \nMW) privatized by June 2004. Privatization got off to a slow start but has gained momentum \nsince late 2006. During late 2006 and 2007, PSALM succeeded in selling eight hydropower \nplants totalling 475 MW (11% of the target) for $664 million. The Masinloc power plant is the \nninth and the largest power plant offered for privatization.  \n \n18.  The installed capacity and power generation in Luzon by ownership is shown in Table 4. \nWhile the share of IPPs is 80%, most of the IPP generating capacity is contracted with NPC or \nMeralco through PPAs. This means is that the Luzon power generation market (WESM) is \ncontrolled by three dominant players (NPC, PSALM, and Meralco) on the supply side with only a \n5% market share held by independent players. Some companies operate on both sides of the \nmarket. Acquisition of Masinloc by AES is another step, following the earlier privatization of \neight hydropower plants, in further diversifying the generation market. \n \nTable 4: Installed Capacity and Generation in Luzon by Ownership in 2006 \n \nInstalled Capacity  Generation \nOwnership  %  % \n(MW)  (GWh) \nNPC  2,469  20  10,547  26 \nIPP  with  PPAs  with  NPC \n6,669  55  15,698  38 \n(administered by PSALM) \nIPPs with PPAs with Meralco  2,304  19  14,309  35 \nOthers  649  5  688  2 \nTotal  12,091  100  41,242  100 \n IPP = independent power producer, Meralco = Manila Electricity Company, MW = megawatt,  \n NPC = National Power Corporation, PPA = power purchase agreement. \n Source: Department of Energy, Power Statistics. \n \n19.  Transmission  Assets.  Transmission  has  now  been  spun  off  into  a  state-owned \ncompany called National Transmission Company (Transco). The Government has decided to \nprivatize Transco by awarding a concession for the use of the transmission assets. However, \nseveral attempts to bid out the concession contract have failed. PSALM launched another round \nof bidding in July 2007 and the bids are expected in December 2007.  \n \n20.  Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. WESM started operations in the Luzon grid in June \n2006. It was designed to fulfill a wide range of objectives, the foremost of which is the promotion \nof competition in the generation sector. WESM is a mandatory gross-offer pool with net bilateral \nsettlement and locational marginal pricing. All generators are required to offer into the market \nbut may settle directly bilateral contracts (PPAs) that are registered with Philippine Electricity ", " \n7\nMarket Corporation (PEMC), the market operator.15 Prices are based on the marginal generator. \nOf the total volume traded, 15-45% represent spot transactions and the rest represent bilateral \ntransactions (under PPAs), depending on the month. \n \n21.  The system operator is part of Transco and is in charge of central dispatch and system \nstability. It schedules enough power generation to meet expected power demand throughout the \nday,  with  adequate  reserve  margins  to  take  care  of  contingencies.  All  energy,  including \nquantities sold through bilateral contracts, is dispatched by the system operator. Once the \nmarket operator has matched bids with expected demand and determined the market-clearing \nprice, the market operator generates and forwards the dispatch schedule to the system operator \nfor implementation. Participants settle their accounts by the hour once the system operator has \ninformed them of the prices and schedules. The WESM market design was largely derived from \nthe New Zealand market and is similar to the system in Singapore.  \n \n22.  Spot market prices since the commencement of WESM have ranged between a high of \nP12/kWh and a low of P0/kWh,16 averaging about P4.2/kWh.17 WESM prices shot up from \nP2.72/kWh during the first trading month to P4.85/kWh in the third month. This led the PEMC to \nlaunch an investigation and to issue a report accusing PSALM of anti-competitive behavior.18  \n \n23.  It is not surprising that spot prices have been high. As described above, WESM currently \nhas only a limited number of participants, with three of them (NPC, PSALM, and Meralco) \ncommanding market power. \n  \n24.  As of September 2007, the load weighted average spot price at WESM was about \nP4.5/kWh. Although EPIRA did not stipulate any prerequisites for the launch of WESM, the \nexpectations were that about 70% of NPC\u2019s generating assets would have been privatized by \nthen. Even as privatization stalled, the Government went ahead with WESM. As a salve for the \nexcessive market share of PSALM, the task of bidding to sell the capacity of NPC- contracted \nIPPs on WESM was delegated to four PSALM trading groups (now consolidated into three). The \nintention  was  that  these  groups  would  act  independently  with  the  objective  of  optimizing \nutilization and revenue from the plants. However, the extent to which these three teams act \nindependently of each other has been questioned, as they are subject to PSALM\u2019s management \nauthority and governance.  \n \n25.  Recognizing this structural defect, PSALM is currently undertaking an initiative, with \nassistance from ADB and the World Bank, to appoint independent IPP administrators in an \nattempt to introduce more competitive players into the market. However, this initiative has \nalready been under discussion for more than 2 years, with as yet little real progress. The design \n                                                 \n15 PEMC is a non-profit organization created by the Department of Energy to serve as an autonomous group market \noperator of WESM. It is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of representatives from the different sectors in \nthe power industry: WESM, Transco, generators, and distributors. Neither the WESM rules nor EPIRA provided for \na  representative  from  end  users  of  electricity  except  for  representatives  from  economic  zones  and  the \nsemiconductor and electronics industries. \n16 For more than 15% of the year (from midnight to 6am), actual spot prices are essentially zero. This apparently \ncounterintuitive result\u2014that wholesale electricity is free at the margin\u2014is a product of the gas-fired generators \nbeing on take-or-pay contracts. These generators pay for the gas whether they burn it or not, and so during periods \nof low demand are willing to offer their power at zero marginal cost. With most capacity sold to distributors on \ncontract, however, average prices are well above zero. Thermal plants also have to maintain minimum running \nlevels overnight if they are to be able to ramp up for the higher demands in the day time. \n17 These are daily average prices. On an hourly basis, the highest price exceeds P18/kWh. \n18 The matter was referred to ERC as an apparent abuse of market power. ERC launched its own investigation and \nconcluded that there was no prima face case against PSALM and closed the investigation. ", "8   \nof the contractual arrangements with an independent administrator is likely to be complex, and \nrapid progress is unlikely. It has also been recognized that NPC\u2019s debt should not intervene in \nthe price-making in the wholesale market. In a truly competitive market, the wholesale market \nprice is determined by the marginal cost of generation for the marginal plant. NPC\u2019s \u201cstranded \ncosts\u201d and \u201cstranded debt\u201d should ideally be recovered from the retail tariff. Steps have been \ntaken to distinguish clearly the market price from the price of recovering the stranded costs and \ndebt  by  unbundling  the  retail  tariff  into  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  supply  and \nuniversal charges separately itemized on a customer bill. However, not all stranded costs or \ndebts are reflected in the retail tariff at this point.  \n \n26.  Open Access and Retail Competition. In 2007, ERC issued a resolution outlining a \npossible timeline toward open access. Open access means that third parties are allowed to use \nthe transmission and/or distribution system and associated facilities of any distribution utility, \nsubject to the payment of transmission and/or distribution retail wheeling rates duly approved by \nERC. In effect, distribution utilities will no longer have the right to refuse the use by third parties \nof  its  distribution  lines.  This  is  a  necessary  condition  for  competition,  among  generators, \ndistributors, and other forms of electricity suppliers, in the retail market. \n \n27.  Under Section 31 of EPIRA, ERC is only able to declare open access when a number of \nconditions have been met.19 Among the most important of these are: (i) privatization of at least \n70% of the total capacity of NPC generation assets in Luzon and Visayas; and (ii) transfer of the \nmanagement and control of at least 70% of the total energy output of power plants under \ncontracts with NPC to independent IPP administrators. In addition, ERC emphasized that it will \nconsider the creation of the appropriate customer switching arrangements and the adequacy of \nthe generation and transmission infrastructure in deciding on the date for open access. ERC \nmust conduct a public hearing on whether all the necessary conditions have been met before \ndeclaring open access, and the initial stage of open access (for loads of 1 MW and above) will \ncome into effect 6 months from the date of declaration. At this time, it is unclear when exactly \nopen access will come into effect but the earliest estimate is 2011. While the requirement that \n70%  of  NPC  generation  assets  be  privatized  may  be  met  as  soon  as  early  2009,  the \nprocurement of the IPP administrators has not yet begun. This is a new concept in competitive \npower markets that has not been tested elsewhere in the world and it will take time for the \nmarket to understand the opportunities and the risks involved.  \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n28.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for Philippines20 lists fiscal imbalance, a poor \ninvestment  climate,  and  weak  governance  as  the  country\u2019s  three  most  critical  binding \ndevelopment constraints. The CSP developed a set of targeted sector policy reform packages, \neach of which is expected to have a direct impact on at least one of these constraints. The three \nreform areas are power, financial markets, and governance.21 Improving the investment climate \n                                                 \n19 Initially, generators will be allowed to contract only with end-users of minimum 1 MW of demand. This will include \nADB, whose peak demand is 3.8 MW. \n20 ADB. 2005. Philippines: Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132007). Manila; and ADB. 2006.

The first subprogram of the cluster was approved on 8 February 2007. \nADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Cluster, ", " \n9\nis a focus of all proposed program lending operations and infrastructure weaknesses have been \nrepeatedly identified by businesses as a key obstacle to investment in the Philippines. The \nPower Sector Development Program (PSDP) will have a direct impact on fiscal consolidation 22 \nby reducing the losses at NPC, enhancing the creditworthiness of PSALM and the energy \ncompanies, and creating conditions for the privatization of major power assets.23 The CSP \nadvocates more cooperation between ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations to enhance \ninvestor confidence and promote private investment critical to offset fiscally-constrained public \ninvestment. PSDP support for a well-regulated, privatized power sector, together with financial \ninvestments, will increase investor interest. A list of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the \nPhilippines is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Energy Sector Strategy \n29.  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy24  defines  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \npoverty by creating an energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental impacts; \nand (iv) promoting regional cooperation. In particular, the strategy strongly encourages ADB \ninterventions to increase private sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of \nprivate  operators\u2019  higher  operational  efficiencies  and  to  respond  to  the  large  capital \nrequirements of power projects. The strategy also encourages liberalization of markets and \nelimination of subsidies.  \n \n3.  Consistency with Asian Development Bank Strategies \n30.  The Project is fully in line with ADB\u2019s country and energy sector strategies. It will directly \ncontribute toward achieving the PSDP\u2019s objective of correcting the country\u2019s fiscal imbalance by \ncatalyzing privatization of an NPC-owned power plant and bringing in sales revenues to the \nGovernment of $930 million. The Project will also help to improve the investment climate by \nincreasing the reliability of generating capacity for commercial and industrial centers. Successful \nacquisition and operation of the Masinloc plant by a reputable foreign private sector will boost \nmarket confidence and encourage further privatizations of NPC\u2019s assets and the entry of new \nplayers in the market. The Project will enhance competition in the generator market and, in the \nlong run, help to drive the electricity price down.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nLoan, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Philippines for the Development Policy Support \nProgram.

The Masinloc power plant is a pulverized coal-fired power plant with a designed net \ncapacity  of  600  MW  located  in  the  town  of  Masinloc  in  Zambales  province.  It  is  about  \n250 kilometers (km) northwest of Metro Manila, 110 km northwest of Subic Bay and 30 km north \nof  the  provincial  capital,  Iba.  The  plant  has  two  300  MW  generating  units,  which  were \nconstructed  in  phases  by  Mitsubishi  Corporation  of  Japan  under  turnkey  engineering, \nprocurement,  and  construction  contracts.  Each  unit  has  an  identical  drum-type  force \nrecirculation  boiler  supplied  by  Mitsubishi  Heavy  Industries  (MHI).  The  steam  turbine  and \ngenerator systems were also supplied by MHI and the electrical generators were supplied by \nMitsubishi Electric. The plant\u2019s onsite facilities include storage tanks for fuel oil, potable and raw \nwater supply, a water-treatment plant, a coal stockyard, a coal crusher house, ash-handling and \nstorage facilities, and the central control building.  \n \n32.  ADB provided a public sector loan to NPC of $197 million approved on 13 October \n199025 for the construction of unit 1, and another public sector loan of $162 million and a partial \ncredit guarantee of Y12 billion approved on 2 November 199526 to cover additional costs of  \nunit 1, construction of unit 2, and associated transmission facilities and activities. Unit 1 was \ncompleted at a total cost of $520 million and began commercial operations on 18 June 1998. \nUnit 2 was completed at a total cost of $167 million and began commercial operations on  \n10 December 1998. The plant has been operated to date by NPC. Power from the plant is \ntransmitted to Metro Manila through the northern Luzon transmission corridor. ADB conducted a \nproject performance audit review in May 200227 and concluded that the construction of the \nMasinloc plant was highly relevant to help address the country\u2019s severe power shortages. \nAlthough implementation was delayed,28 the plant was seen as providing least-cost generation \nof electricity and at that time was deemed to be maintained in a satisfactory condition.  \n \n33.  More recent data, however, indicate that the operating performance of the plant has \ndeclined since 2001 because of inadequate maintenance and insufficient capital investments in \nanticipation of the planned privatization. During 2001\u20132006, utilization of the Masinloc plant \ndecreased from 76% to 45%. Almost none of its systems can operate at full capacity because of \npoor maintenance.29 A lack of spare parts is a major concern for proper maintenance of the \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1990.

Manila. This loan was \ncofinanced by J-EXIM, World Bank, KfW, and others. \n27 ADB. 2002. Project Performance Audit Report on the Sixteenth Power (Masinloc Thermal Power) Project (Loan \n1042-PHI) in the Philippines. Manila. \n28 The 3.5 year delay was largely due to the longer than expected lead time for land acquisition. While the actual \nconstruction took shorter (39 months) than planned (42 months), the full output of unit 1 was not evacuated \nbecause of transmission line constraints. Unit 1 started to evacuate its output only in March 1999, when the 500 \nkilovolt (kV) transmission facilities (financed by ADB and cofinanciers under the Northern Luzon Transmission and \nGeneration Project) were put into operation.  \n29 The major operational problems have been the failure of the ship unloader, coal pulverizers, boiler feed pumps, \nash handling system, and misalignment of the coal belt conveyor. ", " \n11\nplant. Unit 1 had a major overhaul in 2005 (the first since commercial operations began in 1998) \nbut there has been no major overhaul of unit 2. The plant\u2019s operations have been characterized \nby low capacity, poor availability, low reliability, and violations of environmental, health, and \nsafety conditions. The plant\u2019s emissions are unable to meet dust emission limits at any load. \nThe Masinloc operating statistics for units 1 and 2 combined for 1999\u20132006 are presented in \nAppendix 2. \n \n2.  Rehabilitation Plan \n34.  Upon takeover, MPPC plans a 2-year rehabilitation of the plant. The current capacity \nutilization is only 45%, but MPPC aims to raise the net output to 600 MW after the rehabilitation \nand to run the plant at 89% capacity utilization in ordinary years and 87% in major maintenance \nyears (every 6 years). MPPC is also confident that the heat rate can be improved. The plant\u2019s \nuseful life is 40 years upon acquisition and rehabilitation by MPPC. \n \n35.  The rehabilitation effort will focus on returning the existing plant systems to the original \nequipment manufacturer (OEM) specifications, particularly the environment-related components \nof the plant. The plant was originally properly engineered and constructed to meet technical and \nenvironmental  performance  requirements  and  there  is  little  technological  or  environmental \nperformance  risk  involved  in  returning  the  facility  to  its  OEM  specifications.  Major  plant \noperating repairs will be carried out on the safety devices and systems, the ash collection and \ntransport system, and the boiler feed pumps and forced circulation pump. Major OEMs including \nMHI have already visited the Masinloc plant since MPPC won the bid. More details on the \nrehabilitation plan are contained in Appendix 3.  \n \nB.  Management and Ownership \n1.  Borrower \n \n36.  MPPC  is  currently  indirectly  fully  owned  by  AES.  However,  International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC) has proposed taking a 6% partnership interest in MPPC and AES also plans \nto sell at a later stage 25-30% of its shares in MPPC to a local partner still to be identified.  \n \n37.  MPPC  will  receive  commercial,  financial,  and  risk  management  support  from  AES \nPhilippines Energy Supply Business (APESB), an energy marketing company established by \nAES. APESB will market the generation from Masinloc under bilateral contracts to customers, \nincluding  distribution  utilities,  special  economic  zones,  electric  cooperatives,  and  large \ncommercial and industrial customers so Masinloc will not sell only to the spot market. APESB \nwill  consist  of  sales  and  marketing,  asset  optimization,  risk  management,  and  billing  and \nstatements teams. The sales and marketing team will oversee all activities related to the sales \nand  marketing  of  Masinloc\u2019s  dispatch.  The  asset  optimization  team  will  carry  out  trading, \nscheduling, fuel procurement, and contract structuring. \n \n2.  Sponsor \n \n38.  AES Corporation, formed in 1981, is a Delaware holding company whose subsidiaries \noperate a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses in 27 countries. It is one \nof the world\u2019s largest global power companies with 2006 revenues of $12.3 billion and 32,000 \nemployees. AES has an ownership interest in assets with a combined generating capacity of \nover 43,000 MW. Its 13 distribution companies serve 11 million retail customers and had sales \nof over 73,000 GWh in 2006. AES is listed on New York Stock Exchange. It is rated BB- by ", "12   \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and B1 by Moody\u2019s. Apart from generation and distribution, AES is engaged \nin related activities that include alternative energy businesses such as wind generation, the \nsupply of liquefied natural gas to targeted North American markets, greenhouse gas reduction \nactivities, and related industries, involving environmental issues and the application of new \nenergy technologies.  \n \n39.  In generation, AES is engaged in both contract and competitive supply businesses. \nAES\u2019s contract generation businesses own and operate plants that sell electricity and related \nproducts to utilities or other wholesale customers under long-term contracts. The company's \ncontract generation facilities generally limit its exposure to commodity price risks, electricity \nprice volatility, and often to volume risk by entering into power sales agreements of 5 years or \nlonger for 75% or more of its output capacity. AES\u2019s competitive supply (merchant generation) \nbusinesses own and operate plants that sell electricity to wholesale customers in competitive \nmarkets. These plants typically sell into local power pools under short-term contracts (less than \n5 years) or into daily spot markets. AES was one of the first entrants into the merchant power \nbusiness, which it joined in 1996. This part of AES\u2019s business now consists of 27 power \ngeneration  facilities  with  a  total  capacity  of  13,000  MW30  located  in  Argentina,  Colombia, \nHungary, Kazakhstan, Panama, United Kingdom, and USA (the list of all merchant power plants \nof  AES  is  in  Appendix  4).  The  merchant  power  business  comprises  about  32%  of  AES \nrevenues. AES manages merchant risks through various mechanisms, depending on the nature \nof the business and the markets in which the business is operating.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Asset Purchase Agreement \n40.  MPPC  will  acquire  the  assets  of  the  plant  from  PSALM  under  an  asset  purchase \nagreement (APA) dated 26 July 2007. Under the APA, MPPC is required to pay at least 40% of \nthe purchase price upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, and following the payment \nof such portion of the purchase price (the closing date) will be granted possession of, and \nassume rights and liabilities pertaining to, the purchased assets. MPPC will obtain title to the \npurchased assets upon the execution of the deed of absolute sale by PSALM, which PSALM is \nobliged  to  complete  within  30  days  from  the  payment  of  the  entire  purchase  price.  The \nremaining 60% of the purchase price is payable over a period of 7 years in 14 semi-annual \ninstallments if MPPC opts to pay the purchase price in installments.  \n \n41.  The project site consists of onshore lands and foreshore lands. The plant stands on the \nonshore lands consisting of 138 hectares (ha) of \u201cleased premises\u201d and 11 ha of \u201creclaimed \nland\u201d. Coal-handling jetties and a discharge channel stand on 6 ha of \u201cforeshore lands\u201d. MPPC \nwill rent the leased premises from PSALM in accordance with the LLA. Under the APA, PSALM \nis obliged to acquire a transferable right (i.e., a rental right), title or ownership over the reclaimed \nland that will enable it to be included as part of the leased premises within 7 years from the \nclosing date. The reclaimed land is currently in the public domain but is scheduled to be \nconverted into private land by a presidential promulgation and acquired by PSALM.  Once \nPSALM acquires such transferable right or title, the reclaimed land will be included as part of the \nleased premises and therefore be leased to MPPC under the LLA and can be included in the \npurchase option exercisable by MPPC. PSALM is also obliged under the APA to acquire a \n                                                 \n30 While this capacity is located in countries with competitive electricity markets, not all of it is traded on a merchant \nbasis. Like the Philippines\u2019 WESM, these markets also use bilateral contracts. Of AES\u2019s total capacity of 13,000 \nMW, about 10,750 MW is sold under short-term PPAs (less than 5 years) or on a merchant basis, and the rest is \nsold under longer-term PPAs. ", " \n13\ntransferable right over the foreshore lands within 7 years from the closing date. The foreshore \nlands are also in the public domain. Because they are natural resources, even PSALM cannot \nacquire title to the foreshore lands. The foreshore lands will continue to be owned by the \nGovernment and will be leased to PSALM, upon which PSALM will sublease the lands for use \nby MPPC.  \n \n2.  Land Lease Agreement \n42.  MPPC will lease the leased premises from PSALM under the LLA, dated 26 July 2007. \nMPPC can lease the site for 20 years, with an option to extend for the lesser of 10 years or the \nremaining corporate life of PSALM, upon mutual agreement. MPPC has the right to acquire the \nleased premises (except for the foreshore lands and with respect to the reclaimed lands, subject \nto PSALM including the reclaimed lands in the option) once PSALM completes the acquisition of \ntitle to the land.  \n \n3.  Power Sales \n43.  For the Masinloc plant, NPC has executed PPAs with 12 customers totaling 264 MW \nequivalent of supply volume (44% of total stated capacity). These PPAs will be transferred to \nMPPC along with the plant. Electric cooperatives represent 75% of these customers and the \nrest are special economic zones and industrial parks. In terms of the supply volume, 33% of \nthese contracts will expire within 2007, 51% in 2008, 6% in 2009, and 10% in 2010. AES plans \nto sell Masinloc\u2019s output both on a bilateral contract basis and in the spot market.  \n \n4.  Coal Supply \n44.  Currently,  the  Masinloc  plant  is  fueled  by  coal  the  Government  buys  under  supply \ncontracts with Australia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). AES management believes \nsome cost reductions could be made immediately by simply making coal supply practices \nconform to AES\u2019s global norms. Cost reductions would not only improve plant profitability, but \nshould be enough to drop Masinloc below other coal-fired plants in the merit order, giving it the \nability to bid less than other plants and dispatch considerably greater quantities of power than \npreviously. MPPC\u2019s coal will be procured by APSEB, which will coordinate with AES\u2019s global \nfuel  procurement  teams  when  negotiating  with  global  coal  suppliers  in  order  to  achieve \ncompetitive terms.  \n \n5.  Transmission \n45.  The Masinloc plant is connected to the transmission grid via an 89-km double-circuit 230 \nkilovolt (kV) transmission line to the Labrador substation. Power evacuation from Masinloc is \npossible via four major transmission corridors.31 The total combined capacity of these four \n                                                 \n31 These are (i) the 500 kV double-circuit Labrador\u2014San Manuel\u2014San Jose transmission line, (ii) the 230 kV single-\ncircuit Labrador\u2014Botolan\u2014Hermosa\u2014Balintawak transmission line, (iii) the 230 kV mostly single-circuit San \nManuel\u2014Pantabangan\u2014Cabanatuan\u2014Mexico\u2014Balintawak transmission line, and (iv) 230 kV single-circuit San \nManuel\u2014Conception\u2014Mexico\u2014Talintawak transmission line. Of these, (i) was financed by ADB (ADB. 1995. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the National Power \nCorporation  and  a  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Northern  Luzon \nTransmission and Generation Project in the Republic of the Philippines and a Proposed Guarantee of a Bond issue \nby the National Power to Provide Cofinancing for the Project. Manila) and the upgrade of (ii) is being financed by \nADB (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nthe National Power Corporation for the Electricity Market and Transmission Development Project and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Republic of the Philippines for the Transition to Competitive Electricity Market. Manila). ", "14   \ncorridors is 6,100 megavolt-ampere (MVA) and they allow the Masinloc plant to dispatch its full \nload to the grid. No transmission constraints are expected. \n \n6.  Operation and Maintenance \n46.  Following its normal practice, AES will operate the plant in-house, with technical support \nfrom its central engineering department as necessary.  \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Aspects \n47.  The Masinloc plant is located within Barangay Bani, in the municipality of Masinloc,32 a \nsite that has been zoned as industrial by the Government. The project site consists of 149 ha of \nonshore and reclaimed lands and 6 ha of foreshore lands. Onsite plant facilities include storage \ntanks for fuel oil, potable and raw water supply, a water-treatment plan, coal stockyard, and coal \ncrusher house, ash-handling and storage facilities, and the central control building. Offshore \nfacilities include coal-handling jetties and a discharge channel. \n \n1.  Environment \n48.  When ADB processed its loan to unit 1 of the plant in 1990, there was no environmental \ncategorization  system  in  place.  NPC,  in  coordination  with  Electric  Power  Development \nCompany of Japan, prepared the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for both units in 1990. \nADB  assisted  NPC  in  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  management  plan  and  system \nthrough technical assistance.33 When ADB processed its loan to unit 2 in 1995, the plant was \nassigned environmental category A based on a review of the original EIA and the environmental \nissues and mitigation measures for unit 1, which was then under construction. \n \n49.  In acquiring the plant, MPPC carried out an environmental performance audit through a \nconsulting  firm,  Environmental  Resources  Management  (ERM).  ERM  identified  significant \nenvironmental issues, related to (i) air emissions; (ii) wastewater, (iii) storm water and drainage; \n(iv) materials handling and storage; (v) waste management; (vi) marine ecological impacts; and \n(vii) contaminated groundmass. An ADB due diligence mission visited the site and confirmed the \nERM findings that the proposed rehabilitation measures reflected extensive maintenance needs, \nranging  from  replacement  of  much  needed  spares  to  an  overhaul  of  plant  grounds  and \nequipment. Based on ERM\u2019s findings, ADB and MPPC have agreed that the following areas \nneed to be addressed urgently: (i) the electrostatic precipitator (to reduce the particulate matter \nemissions);  (ii)  wastewater  and  stormwater  collection  and  treatment;  and  (iii)  the  ash \nmanagement system. MPPC has prepared corrective action plans for these areas and these \nhave been accepted by ADB. In addition, MPPC commits generally to bring the environment, \nhealth, and safety aspects of the plant up to AES\u2019s rigorous global standards. AES will apply \nkey environmental standards for air emissions and wastewater discharges following national \nand World Bank standards. Masinloc will be required to implement the AES safety management \nsystem and to comply with AES safety standards. It will also be audited within 12 months of \n                                                 \n32 The land uses surrounding the site comprise: to the north, agricultural plantations, informal rural communities, and \nthe Lauis River about 1 km from the site; to the east, rural communities and National Highway 3 about 1 km from \nthe site; to the south, Oyon Bay, which is a fish sanctuary and a protected area; and to the west, the South China \nSea. About 11 ha of land at the edge of the southern part of the site was reclaimed, reportedly using land based \nsoils excavated locally. \n33 This technical assistance involved establishing an environmental baseline monitoring system for impacts during the \noperational phase; upgrading NPC\u2019s in-house capacity for environmental management; developing a strategy for \nfly ash utilization; examining the possibility of reducing oil dependence by rehabilitating and converting existing oil-\nfired units to coal-fired units.   ", " \n15\ntakeover by MPPC and at least once in 3 years subsequently as part of the AES safety audit \nprogram.  Implementation  by  AES  of  the  environmental  management  plan,  including  the \ncorrective action plans, will be monitored throughout the life of the ADB financing. \n \n50.  Based on the field visit, the review of the environment performance audit report, and the \ncorrective  action  plans,  ADB  has  classified  the  proposed  Project  as  category  B.  The \nrehabilitation work by MPPC aims to bring the plant\u2019s operating and environmental performance \nback to the original design standards and does not involve any expansion or additional facilities. \nIt  will  improve  the  operating  efficiency,  save  coal,  reduce  carbon  dioxide  and  other \nenvironmental  emissions,  and  increase  the  health  and  safety  standards  of  the  plant.  The \nenvironmental  performance  audit  report  and  the  corrective  action  plans  are  regarded  as \nconstituting the initial environmental examination (IEE) and is scheduled to be posted on the \nAsian Development Bank website on about 3 December 2007.  \n \n51.  The Masinloc plant was accorded an environmental clearance by the Government in \n1992 based on the original EIA. The Government has informed MPPC that no further EIA or \nenvironmental clearance is required before it takes over the physical assets, conducts extensive \nmaintenance measures, and operates the plant. MPPC still needs to obtain or periodically \nrenew certain routine and readily available environmental permits, including a permit to operate \nair pollution source and control installations, an offshore lease permit, and a reclamation permit. \nMPPC  will  regularly  submit  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  the  Department  of  the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources. \n \n2.  Social Aspects \n52.  Indigenous Peoples. The Project has been categorized C with respect to its impacts on \nindigenous peoples. While Zambales is home to two indigenous groups, there are no people at \nthe plant site. No ancestral domain claims have been reported for the lands occupied by the \nplant and at the resettlement sites.  \n \n53.  Involuntary Resettlement. The Project has been categorized C with respect to the \ninvoluntary resettlement. The Project will not involve any land acquisition, change in land use, or \naccess restriction. The plant site is fenced and there are no settlers inside the property. Before \nconstruction of the Masinloc plant, the plant area, consisting primarily of coastal community \nholdings, was planted with mangoes, paddy, and minor agricultural produce. In June 1996, \nabout 2 years before the commissioning of the plant, NPC, in collaboration with the municipality \nof Masinloc, completed the relocation of 198 families living at the plant site. 105 families were \nrelocated to a resettlement site in Barangay Taltal, 1.5 km away from their original settlement, \nand 93 families opted for self-relocation. A total budget of $25.75 million was allocated to these \nactivities. In 2002, an ADB operations evaluation mission identified some unresolved issues, \nwhich were (i) disputes over compensation amounts and delayed transfer of land ownership, (ii) \nsaline  drinking  water  at  the  resettlement  site,  and  (iii)  limited  job  opportunities  for  project \naffected families.  \n \n54.  NPC has been working to resolve these issues. Compensation has now been paid to all \nbut  one  claimant  (for  whom  final  payment  is  being  negotiated).  The  relocated  families  in \nBarangay Taltal received certificates of award for a 6 x 3 meter (m) housing unit on a 200 m2 \nhome lot. The judicial titling process for the ownership of resettlement lands is still ongoing. \nWhen the titling process has been completed, NPC will formally attach titles to the certificates of \naward. Marked improvements to the housing units and significant job creation were observed at \nthe relocation site during the due diligence mission. The following civil works were carried out at ", "16   \nthe relocation site: (i) construction of a seawall (riprapping) and a concrete pavement; (ii) \nrehabilitation of the water supply system; (iii) installation of water lines and a concrete cover for \nthe  existing  canal;  (iv)  procurement  of  school  equipment  and  construction  of  the  concrete \nperimeter fence; (v) construction of a multi-purpose hall for senior citizens, a day care center \nand a health center; and (vi) installation of streetlights at the relocation site.  \n \n55.  When it takes over the plant, MPPC will support continued implementation of community \ndevelopment activities in line with AES policy to support sustainable business practices in the \ncommunities in which it operates. In particular, MPPC will work closely with the multipartite \nmonitoring  committee  (MPMC)  comprising  representatives  of  regulatory  agencies,  local \ngovernment entities, and NPC, to ensure that the Masinloc plant continues to support local \ncommunities. Under the APA, MPPC is committed to adhere to the 2005 memorandum of \nunderstanding  (MOA)  signed  by  PSALM,  NPC,  and  representatives  of  local  governments. \nUnder the MOA, MPPC as the owner of a privatized plant will recognize, support, and fully \ncooperate with MPMC to monitor Masinloc plant\u2019s compliance with environmental compliance \ncertificate conditions and to address the social and environmental concerns of the people of \nMasinloc and Zambales. MPPC will give priority employment to qualified local residents, give \nthe municipality of Masinloc preference, if qualified, in awards of plant-related contracts, and \nstrictly observe and comply with its obligations to provide financial benefits to host communities \nas required by the regulations.34 Furthermore, MPPC will implement and devise new socio-\neconomic projects and public health monitoring along with annual medical, dental, and surgical \nmissions. \n \nE.  Development Impact35 \n56.  The  Project  aims  to  promote  Philippines\u2019  sustainable  economic  development  by \nproviding revenues to the Government, improving the reliability, and reducing the cost of the \nelectricity supply; and improving the investment climate. The acquisition and rehabilitation of the \nMasinloc plant (outputs) will improve operational efficiency and raise the environmental, health, \nand safety standards of an underutilized and poorly-maintained power plant to global standards \n(outcome). The Project will further the privatization of the Philippine power sector and result in a \nreliable and competitively-priced electricity supply that imposes a limited fiscal burden on the \nGovernment (impact). The design and monitoring framework and development effectiveness \nframework are in Appendix 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n34 Under EPIRA and DOE Energy Regulations (ER) No. 1-94, generation facilities owned by NPC transferred to \nPSALM and subsequently privatized are required to provide a P0.01/kWh financial benefit to host communities. \nFurther, as per Republic Act 9136 and ER 1-94, P0.0025/kWh of the total electricity sales will be allocated as \nDevelopment and Livelihood Fund for the resettlement areas. \n35 The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of its contribution to private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability as per the guidelines for implementing the Good \nPractice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup of multilateral development banks. ", " \n17\nF.  Economic Evaluation \n57.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The Project is anticipated to provide a net \nbenefit to the economy by reducing the national debt, replacing current generation with more \nefficient and environmentally-sound generation, adding new generation capacity, and increasing \nthe overall competitiveness of the sector, resulting in lower electricity tariffs in the long term. The \nreduction in the national debt is assumed to be the difference between MPPC\u2019s payment for the \nassets and the depreciated economic value of the assets, adjusted for financing of the Project \nfrom domestic sources. Part of the electricity output from the Project will replace electricity \nalready generated by Masinloc (the nonincremental portion) but the Project enable this to be  \ngenerated in a more efficient manner. The remaining output will be new generation stemming \nfrom the implementation of MPPC\u2019s rehabilitation plan (the incremental portion). The benefit for \nthe nonincremental portion is the opportunity cost the economy \u201csaves\u201d by not having to use \nmore expensive electricity generated by less efficient plants. For the incremental portion, the \nbenefit is calculated by valuing the additional electricity output from the Project at the projected \nWESM spot price. This market price reflects the consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for additional \nelectricity, and hence is a good approximation of the benefit to the economy of Masinloc\u2019s \nadded electricity generation. Environmental benefits are also expected from the Project but \nthese have not been quantified in the analysis. \n \n58.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) under the ADB base case was estimated at \n24.1%,  which  is  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12%.  Testing  this  under  four  adverse \nscenarios demonstrates that the Project is economically robust and viable.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n59.  The proposed ADB assistance is a direct loan of up to $200 million to MPPC without \ngovernment guarantee. Upon or after disbursement of the loan, part of it may be converted, at \nMPPC\u2019s option, to pesos for a period which could be up to the maturity of the loan.  \n \nB.  Justification  \n60.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons.  \n \n(i)  It will further the privatization efforts of the Government to promote competition \nand efficiency in the power sector and to put the sector on sounder financial \nfooting. It will bring the percentage of NPC\u2019s privatized eligible assets to 25%, \nand this will increase to 39% once the Calaca sale is complete. The Project will \nbring in a new market player without vested interests and diversify the generation \nmarket.  While  the  electricity  market  is  projected  to  continue  behaving  in  an \noligopolistic manner initially, anticipated increases in the number of players in the \nmarket (through privatization, appointment of independent administrators for IPP \nplants, and new entrants) will increase competition and as a result electricity \nprices will tend toward the long run marginal cost. Proceeds from the sale of the \nMasinloc plant will be used to reduce NPC\u2019s stranded debt. \n ", "18   \n(ii)  The Project will improve the operating efficiency of the plant and bring the plant\u2019s \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  standards  up  to  global  standards.  The \nMasinloc plant is currently underutilized and violates environmental regulations. \n \n(iii)  The Project will embody ADB\u2019s country and energy strategies, which emphasize \nsupporting energy infrastructure development with private sector participation. \nThe  Project  will  support  ADB\u2019s  thematic  priorities  of  economic  development, \nprivate  sector  development,  good  governance,  and  environmental  protection. \nThe Project will directly complement the Power Sector Development Program by \ncatalyzing  privatization  of  an  NPC-owned  power  plant  and  bringing  in  sales \nrevenues  to  the  Government.  The  Project  will  also  help  to  improve  the \ninvestment climate by increasing the reliability of generating capacity for the \ncountry\u2019s economic center. Successful acquisition and operation of the plant by a \nreputed  foreign  private  sector  will  boost  market  confidence  and  induce \nsubsequent foreign investment.  \n \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s involvement in the Project will catalyze long-term private sector equity and \ndebt.  \n \n(v)  The ADB loan will have a long tenor to ease the Project\u2019s cash flow and to \nmitigate the foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuation risk. In the long \nterm,  local-currency,  fixed-rate  financing  will  enhance  the  sustainability  and \naffordability of the Project and reduce the mismatch between the currency of \nborrowing and the currency of revenues.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n61.  AES was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended todate) and policy \nrelating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require MPPC \nto institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international \nbest practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities \nor the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. \nThe financing documentation between ADB and MPPC will further allow ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n62.  The proposed direct loan will, once approved, increase ADB's group exposure to the \nAES Group to $214 million, ADB\u2019s total nonsovereign exposure to the Philippines to 7.2% and \nthat to the conventional energy generation (other than hydropower) subsector to 16.8%. The \nproposed financing is within ADB\u2019s aggregate, country, industry, group, and single exposure \nlimits for non-sovereign investment.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n63.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \ngovernment of the Philippines will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed  assistance  to  MPPC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such ", " \n19\nconfirmation. ADB will enter into suitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, following approval of the proposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n64.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the proposed loan to Masinloc Power Partners Company Limited for the acquisition and \nrehabilitation of the Masinloc coal-fired thermal power plant of up to $200,000,000 funded from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources on terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in this report and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n  Liqun Jin \n  Vice President \n29 November 2007 ", " \n  2\n0\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES   \n($\u2019000) \nA\n  p\np\nEquity and  Ordinary  e\nn\nInvestment  Line of  Capital  Complementary  Combined  Date of  dix\nNo.  Company  Investment Resources Loan  Guarantee  Total  Approval   1\n7 008  P  lanters Development Bank  00..439551            6. 857  2059  NDoevc  11998961             \n7020/885  Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.    24.000      24.000  29 Mar 1988 \n7025  H&Q Philippine Ventures  2.500        2.500  15 Sep 1988 \n7036  Planters DB Leasing Corp.  0.370        0.370  03 Aug 1989 \n7043/0991  Mirant Navotas Corp.

Masinloc 600 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Independent Technical Assessment Report. \nSingapore (11 October). \n ", "Appendix 3  23 \nREHABILITATION PLAN FOR THE MASINLOC POWER PLANT \n \n1.  The 600 MW pulverized-coal electric generation facility in Masinloc, the Philippines, has \nbeen systematically deteriorating since 2004 because of the inability of the plant personnel to \nprocure  spare  parts  and/or  perform  equipment  repairs.  The  current  management  has  not \napproved funds for parts and/or repairs, so plant personnel have been forced to maintain \noperations with whatever resources are at hand. Spare parts have been depleted and critical \nequipment essential to reliable plant operation cannot be repaired.  \n \n2.  The plant refurbishment effort by Masinloc Power Partners Company Limited (MPPC), \nthe new owner of the plant, will focus on returning the existing plant systems to the original \nequipment manufacturer (OEM) specification. The facility was originally properly engineered \nand constructed to meet environmental and technical performance requirements and there is \nlittle technological or environmental performance risk involved in returning the facility to its OEM \nspecifications. Replacement equipment lead times and the availability of equipment technical \nspecialists have been studied carefully as a part of the refurbishment effort. \n \n3.  The major plant operating repairs will be completed for three critical systems as soon as \npractical upon the take over by MPPC. These are: (i) identification and repair of safety devices \nand  systems,  (ii)  repair  of  ash  collection  and  transport  systems,  and  \n(iii) repair or replacement of the boiler feed water feed pump and forced circulation pump. Coal \nship unloading facilities and reclaimers will be repaired as soon as the facility is transferred to \nMPPC. The current condition of these systems is causing extreme delays in unloading ships, \nresulting  in  excessive  demurrage  charges  as  well  as  the  loss  of  coal  to  uncontrolled \nspontaneous combustion. Numerous other noncritical repairs to various plant systems will also \nbe required. \n \n4.  Critical rehabilitation activities to be undertaken by MPPC include the following: \n \n(i)  coal ship unloading system, \n(ii)  heavy equipment, \n(iii)  fly ash removal and transport systems, \n(iv)  boiler feed pumps, \n(v)  forced circulation pumps, \n(vi)  boiler tube condition, \n(vii)  soot blowing system, \n(viii)  coal pulverizers, and \n(ix)  electrostatic precipitator. \n \n5.  Since winning the tender, MPPC has been working with the OEMs to ascertain their \nviews on the state of the equipment at the plant and to start discussions for their rehabilitation. \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \n \n6.  The following OEMs have visited Masinloc since AES has won the bid:  \n \n(i)  MHI and Mitsubishi \u2013 about 10 specialists covering all sections of plant, \n(ii)  MELCO (a division of Mitsubishi) for electrical supplies by MHI, \n(iii)  Flow-serve for boiler feed pumps, \n(iv)  TechInt for coal handling plant including stacker reclaimers, \n(v)  Macgregor for coal un-loaders, \n(vi)  United Conveyors Corporation for ash-handling systems, \n(vii)  the OEM for steam bypass systems, \n(viii)  Siemens for the chlorination system, and \n(ix)  GE for electrostatic precipitator services. \n \n7.  MPPC is currently reviewing the reports of these visits and obtaining quotations from the \nvarious OEMs. Material will then be sourced using the global sourcing expertise of MPPC\u2019s \nparent company, AES Corporation. \n \n8.  A senior member of staff from AES headquarters will support the process and will \noperate out of the Philippines during this period. Several quotations have already been received \nand are being processed. AES\u2019s experience in turning around similar plants and its global \nrelationships with key OEMs is helping it to achieving faster delivery times and higher quality \nservice.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 4  25 \nAES MERCHANT POWER BUSINESS \n \nYear of Acquisition/  AES Equity \nCommencement of  Gross  Interest \nLocation  Facility  Fuel  Operations  MW  (% rounded)\nAsia \nKazakhstan  Ekibastuz  Coal  1996  4,000  100 \n  Shulbinsk   Hydro  1997  702  0 \n  Sogrinsk   Coal  1997  301  100 \n  Ust-Kamenogorsk 1   Coal  1997  1,354  100 \n  Ust-Kamenogorsk 2  Coal  1997  270  0 \n  Ust-Kamenogorsk 3  Coal  1997  331  0 \n \nNorth America \nUS \u2013 NY  Cayuga  Coal  1999  306  100 \n  Greenidge  Coal  1999  161  100 \n  Somerset  Coal  1999  675  100 \n  Westover  Coal  1999  126  100 \nUS \u2013 TX  Deepwater  Pet Coke  1986  160  100 \n \nLatin America \nArgentina  Alicura  Hydro  2000  1,050  96 \n  Central Dique  Gas/Diesel  1998  68  51 \n  Central Termica San Nicolas   Coal/Gas/Oil  1993  675  96 \n  Parana  Gas  2001  845  100 \n  Quebrada de Ullum  Hydro  2004  45  0 \n  Rio Juramento \u2013 Cabra Corral  Hydro  1995  102  98 \n  Rio Juramento \u2013 El Tunal  Hydro  1995  10  98 \n  San Juan \u2013 Sarmiento  Gas  1996  33  98 \n  San Juan \u2013 Ullum  Hydro  1996  45  98 \nColombia  Chivor  Hydro  2000  1,000  99 \nPanama  Bayano  Hydro  1999  260  49 \n  Chiriqui \u2013 Esti  Hydro  2003  120  49 \n  Chiriqui \u2013 La Estrella  Hydro  1999  45  49 \n  Chiriqui \u2013 Los Valles  Hydro  1999  51  49 \n \nEurope, Middle East, and Africa \nHungary  Tiszapalkonya  Biomass/Coal 1996  116  100 \nU K  Indian Queens  Oil  1996  140  100 \nMW = megawatt, NY = New York, TX = Texas, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States. \nSource: AES Corporation. \n ", "26  Appendix 5           \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORKS \n \nTable A5.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \nData \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting \nTargets/Indicators  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n\u2022 Privatization of the  \u2022 70% of NPC-owned  \u2022 Publicly available  \u2022 Power sector reform \nPhilippine power  power plants privatized by  statistics and  and privatization \nsector resulting in  end of 2009.  reports  efforts continue \nreliable and  \u2022 New capacity additions   \ncompetitively priced  commensurate with \nelectricity with a  demand growth  \nlimited fiscal burden  \u2022 The spot market price \non the Government  goes down to the long-run \nmarginal cost  \n\u2022 NPC\u2019s debt below current \nlevel of P1 trillion \nOutcome      Assumptions \n\u2022 Operational efficiency  \u2022 Utilization increases   \u2022 The project  \u2022 The rehabilitation of \nimproved  \u2022 Heat rate improves   company\u2019s  the plant is \n\u2022 Environmental,  \u2022 Emissions reduced to the  operating reports  completed. \nhealth, and safety  World Bank standards  \u2022 Stable and \nstandards raised to  \u2022 Competitively priced  competitively-priced \nglobal standards  electricity supplied   coal supply \n   \nRisk \n\u2022 Electricity demand \nbelow expectations \nOutputs      Assumption \n\u2022 The power plant  \u2022 Rehabilitation as per the  \u2022 Completion  \u2022 Finance raised \nacquired and  specification  certificates \nrehabilitated by  \u2022 Stated output of 600 MW  \u2022 The project \nproject company  achieved  company\u2019s \n\u2022 Plant\u2019s dependable  operating reports \ncapacity increased \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.
