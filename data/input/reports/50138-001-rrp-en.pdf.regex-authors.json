THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $4.0 million to Walkers Colombo Shipyard (Private) Limited (WCS) for the Shipyard \nRehabilitation and Infrastructure Project in Sri Lanka. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.        Project Identification and Description \n \n2.  Project identification. Sri Lanka is an island nation with 1,340 kilometers of coastline. \nIt is strategically located in the center of the Indian Ocean, near the main east\u2013west international \nmaritime trade route connecting the People\u2019s Republic of China and East Asia to Europe, Africa, \nand the Middle East. More than 60,000 ships travel this route annually, carrying two-thirds of the \nworld\u2019s oil and half of all container shipments.1 The Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2008\u20132010 and \n2010\u20132014 port development plans call for liberalization and strengthening of the rules and \nregulations  to  promote  the  country\u2019s  shipping  and  maritime  businesses.  A  7-year  port \ndevelopment plan is being prepared and will be completed by 2020. By that time Sri Lanka is \nexpected to handle 200 million tons in deadweight tonnage capacity and achieve $1 billion in \nrevenue from the port industry annually, which may require up to $10 billion in incremental \ninvestment.2 Significant investment in ports and shipping-related infrastructure has resulted in the \ngrowth of support industries, such as ship repair. However, the current capacity for ship repairs \nhas not kept pace with the investment in port and shipping capacity. Colombo Dockyard PLC \nis the  only operational shipyard in Sri Lanka that performs work of international quality with \ncapacity,  but it focuses primarily on building new ships.  \n \n3.  MTD Walkers PLC, established in 1854, is one of Sri Lanka\u2019s leading conglomerates \nwith  interests  in  engineering,  construction,  and  infrastructure.  (Confidential  information \nredacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). MTD Walkers\u2019 ship repair \nbusiness will be  undertaken in the three locations through its wholly owned subsidiary Walkers \nShipyards Limited (WSL), which is in the final stages of being incorporated to manage all of MTD \nWalkers\u2019 maritime-related businesses. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n4.  Sponsor and borrower. WSL will be the sponsor, while WCS will implement the project \nand be the borrower of the ADB loan. (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n  \n5.  Sponsor\u2019s parent company. Once established, WSL will be wholly owned by MTD \nWalkers, Sri Lanka\u2019s 46th-largest company in terms of turnover (2015).1 It has a track record in \nSri Lanka in (i) civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering; (ii) pile construction; (iii) power \ngeneration; and (iv) real estate development services. MTD Walkers\u2019 largest subsidiary, CML- \nMTD Construction Ltd. (CML), was involved in the construction of several ADB-funded projects in \nSri Lanka.2  MTD Walkers is publicly listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange with a market \ncapitalization  as  of  28  August  2017  of  SLRs5.5  billion.  MTD  Capital Bhd,  an  investment \n                                                           \n1  LMD The Voice of Business. LMD 100 (2014/15). https://lmd.lk/lmd-100-201415/. \n2  ADB. 1998.

", "2 \n \nholding  company  incorporated  and  domiciled  in  Malaysia,  directly  owns  90.8%  of  MTD \nWalkers; the  remaining 9.2% is publicly held. \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).  \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n6.  Impact. The successful implementation of the project will help develop Sri Lanka into \na  competitive hub for maritime activities in South Asia. The proposed financing will help \nincrease jobs in fisheries and related industries, and improve the socioeconomic status of the \ncountry\u2019s fishing community. Furthermore, improvements in fishing vessel repairs are expected \nto increase  national fisheries production and benefit the nutritional status and food security \nof Sri Lanka\u2019s  population. \n \n7.  Outcome. The outcome will be improved operations of the local marine industry. For \nthe  Colombo yard, the outcome indicators will be the number of small and medium-sized \nfishing vessels with access to ship repairs and the number of merchant vessels up to 70 meters \nlong with access to ship repairs by 2020. During operations, the project is expected to provide \nat least 100 jobs by 2020. \n \n8.  Outputs. The  outputs will  be  (i)  small  vessel  repair  capacity  commissioned,  (ii) \nlocal  employment generated, and (iii) growth of the local economy supported. The output \nindicators will be the number of piers with shiplift and transfer system capacity commissioned in \nthe Colombo  yard  by  2019.  The  project  will  ensure  that  environment  and  safeguards \nstandards  are  well maintained and fully met. WCS\u2019s expansion will lead to direct jobs during \nconstruction. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n9.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which includes a focus on private sector development and \noperations, as well as infrastructure development.8 ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with its \ncountry partnership strategy for Sri Lanka, 2018\u20132022 and upholds two key aspects of the first \npillar for ADB\u2019s focus areas: expanding the provision of growth-orientated infrastructure and \nlogistics,  particularly  improving  connectivity  in  the  transport  sector  such  as  ports,  and \nstrengthening the infrastructure of the economic corridor, especially in the transport sector.9\n \n \n10.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is in \nline  with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which recognizes regional cooperation and \nintegration as an emerging need and challenge that should receive more ADB support.10 This is \nto be done by addressing constraints to trade growth, such as the indirect costs associated with \nunreliable transport times, border-crossing delays, and handling and storage costs that result from \npoor terminal infrastructure. The project is also in line with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional \nCooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020, which emphasizes the need to strengthen connectivity \nbetween economies by improving cross-border physical connectivity.11\n \n \n11.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  The  proposed  loan  will  be  the  first  ADB \nnonsovereign infrastructure loan in Sri Lanka since 2000. In October 2014, ADB approved up to \n$40 million for a senior loan in a related sector to Ocean Sparkle Limited (a company from India) \nfor funding the acquisition of tugboats and platform service vessels to be deployed in India\u2019s and \nSri  Lanka\u2019s  ports. 12  Lessons  from  similar  projects  include (i)  the  need for  robust market ", "3 \n \nassessments and conservative revenue projections, (ii) the need for robust transaction structures \nthat could absorb temporary disruptions in the market, and (iii) the importance of engaging \nsponsors with demonstrated technical and management capability to execute such projects. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \n12.  The project is financially viable because its expected financial internal rate of return \nis  9.7%,  higher  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  9.0%.  The  project  is \neconomically sustainable as the economic internal rate of return is 12.1%, higher than the social \ndiscount rate of 9.0%.3 Sensitivity analysis shows the project is financially and economically \nviable under  adverse scenarios. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance is a direct loan of up to $4.0 million to WCS from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a tenor of 8 years, including a 1-year grace period. \nWSL, the  sponsor, and MTD Walkers, the sponsor\u2019s parent company, will jointly guarantee \nthe ADB loan. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s assistance to the project will add substantial value in the following ways: \n(i)  ADB is filling a critical market gap by funding a project\u2014the first to cater to \nsmaller  vessels\u2014to serve  Sri  Lanka\u2019s shipping  industry. Long-term dollar \nfinancing of the kind proposed to be provided by ADB is not readily available in \nSri Lanka. \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  further  strengthen  the  project\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  standards,  as  well  as  improve  corporate  governance  and \ntransparency of Sri Lanka\u2019s ship repair industry. \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s assistance, an essential source of financing for the project, will support \nthe  government\u2019s initiative to promote the country\u2019s shipping and maritime \nbusinesses  by  developing  a  high-quality  service  operation  to  sustain  the \ngrowth and maintenance of key private sector infrastructure. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy). \n \n \n                                                           \n3 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "4 \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n15.  The project is classified as category B for environment, category C for involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples in accordance with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts are incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. WCS\u2019s capacity and commitment \nto  manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are adequate. The shipyard is \nin a fisheries harbor and has a lease arrangement with the harbor authority. Project activities \nwill be in areas earmarked within the premises of the harbor, free from any non-titleholders, and \nwill have  no involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples impacts. Key issues include the \nmanagement  of dredging activities and disposal of dredged materials, mitigation of noise \nassociated with activities during construction and operation, treatment of wastewater effluent, \ndisposal  of  solid  waste,  and  occupational  health  and  safety  management.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination,  including an environmental management and monitoring plan, an \naudit of the existing facility, and  a corrective action plan, has been prepared for the shipyard \nand will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website upon receipt of Board approval. \n \n16.  The company will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social \nProtection  Strategy (2001), will comply with internationally recognized core labor standards.4 \nThe borrower  will report regularly to ADB on (i) their compliance with such laws and (ii) the \nmeasures taken to  comply  with  the  international  standards.  A  project-specific grievance \nredress mechanism will be adopted, and information disclosure and consultations with affected \npeople will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.5 The project is categorized as \nhaving no gender elements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n17.  WCS (the borrower), WSL (the sponsor), and the sponsor\u2019s parent company were advised \nof ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to combating corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment \ndocumentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the \nfinancing of terrorism, as well as remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n18.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n19.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank,24 6ADB will \nproceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Sri Lanka has \n                                                           \n4  ADB. 2003.
