This is crucial for ensuring the required stability \nof  power  supply  to  consumers  in  the  key  Azeri  industrial  and  economic \nhub closest to the capital city of Baku. \n \nThe  project  components  comprise  (i)  construction  of  a  double-circuit \n220 kV  transmission  line  of  280  kilometers  (km);  (ii)  construction  of \nAgdash  substation  with  installation  of  two  125  megavolt-ampere  (MVA) \ntransformers  and  associated  110  kV  transmission  lines  near  Agdash \nsubstations; \n(iv)  project \n(iii)  expansion  of  Absheron  substation; \nmanagement support; and (v) institutional strengthening. \n \nEnergy  is  a  vital  input  to  support  growth  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  non-oil  services \nand industry sectors. The power sector, along with the oil sector, plays a \nleading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s social and economic growth, contributing one \nthird of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2007. Development of the \npower  sector  has  been  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  priorities.  While  the \ncountry has been successful in engaging the private sector for developing \nand  exporting  its  oil  and  gas  resources,  the  domestic  energy  sector  is \nthreatened  by  unreliable  and  inadequate  power  supply  caused  by  limited \ninfrastructure  and  underinvestment.  Effective \nmaintenance  of  aging \ngeneration  capacity  has  shrunk  because  of \nfor \nrehabilitation  and  capacity  addition.  Low  power  plant  efficiency  and  high \nlosses of transmission and distribution lead to wastage of fossil fuels that \ncould  have  been  exported,  and  nearly  double \nthe  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gas and other pollutants that damage the regional and global \nenvironment. \n \nToday, about 48.4% of Azerbaijan\u2019s 8.5 million people live in rural areas, \noften  with  insufficient  access  to  quality  basic  services.  Lack  of  sufficient \n\ninsufficient \n\nfunds \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nfaces \n\nlevels  of \n\ninadequate \n\nfacilities;  and  (ii) \n\npower,  gas,  and  heat  has  aggravated  the  regional  imbalance  in  the \ncountry.  Poor  quality  and  unreliable  electricity  supply  (i)  inhibit  industrial \nand commercial activities, constraining economic growth and employment \nopportunities  in  regional  areas;  (ii)  promote  switching  to  more  polluting \nfuels  and  accompanying  environmental  impacts;  and  (iii)  cause  hardship \nto the population and affect their health.   \n \nThe  power  network  of  Azerbaijan \ntwo  major  development \nchallenges:  (i)  deteriorating  and  aging  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution \ninvestment  and \nmaintenance.  Over  20%  of  all  energy  equipment  and  over  half  of  the \nnetwork  facilities  are  well  beyond  their  useful  life.  This  reduces  the \nreliability and efficiency of the power network operation. The high level of \nphysical  wear  of  equipment  at  power  plants  and  networks  leads  to \nfrequent  power  failures  in  the  populated  areas  and  affects  the  economic \nactivities in the country. The inadequate capacity of transmission lines also \nresults  in  a  shortage  of  reserves  in  the  stability  of  the  power  system, \nincreasing the potential risk of power system operation. Rehabilitation and \nupgrading  of  transmission  facilities  would  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of \nfuture system failure. \n \nThe  Project  targets  key  strategic  transmission  lines,  which  are  severely \ndeteriorated  and  need  to  be  rehabilitated  on  a  priority  basis.  The  Project \nwill  also  contribute  to  optimizing  the  domestic  energy  resource  utilization \nand  reducing  fossil  fuel  consumption  and  power  import.  The  current \nAzerbaijan  power  system  is  not  being  operated  optimally  because  of \nconstraints  on  existing  components  of \ntransmission  network. \nHydropower  energy  generated  in  the  west  region  is  not  efficiently \ndelivered  to  the  central  region  where  demand  is  increasing  rapidly. \nReplacement  of  the  220  kV  transmission  lines  would  allow  the  existing \nhydropower  plant  to  increase  its  available  outputs  to  the  optimal  level\u2014 \nthe peak power supply could be enhanced while power energy generated \nfrom  thermal  power  plants  in  the  central  and  east  regions  could  be \nreduced.  This  would  permit  optimal  utilization  of  the  grid  networks  and \ngeneration  capacity  by  reducing  the  shifting  operation  time  of  large \nthermal  power  plants,  thus  improving  the  efficiency  and  stability  of \ngeneration units and reducing excessive consumption of fuels. The saved \nfuel  including  gas  and  oil  would  be  exported  to  increase  government \nrevenues.  Thus,  Azerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (Azerenergy) \nand the country would benefit from savings in fuel expenditures, improving \nenergy efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  facilitate  the  country\u2019s  economic  development  by \nstrengthening  infrastructure  development,  removing  the  bottleneck  of \npower transmission, and improving the  efficiency of services. The project \nimpact  is  an  improved  power  transmission  system  that  provides  reliable \nand adequate electricity for sustained economic growth. \n \nThe  outcome  will  be  an  expanded  and  strengthened  backbone  220 kV \npower transmission and distribution network, with transmission bottlenecks \nremoved and losses reduced. \n\nthe \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nProject \nInvestment Plan \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nThe total investment cost of the Project is estimated at $240 million.  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n     Ordinary Capital Resources \nAzerenergy  \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n \n160.0 \n80.0 \n240.0 \n\n%  \n \n67 \n33 \n100 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $160.0  million  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year \nterm  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n \nAzerenergy,  which  is  the  state-owned  enterprise  responsible  for  power \nproduction,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  Azerbaijan,  will  be  the \nBorrower while the Government will provide the sovereign guarantee.

Azerenergy  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  in  the  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments, bid evaluation, and project supervision. Relevant international \npractices  and  standards  will  be  adhered  to  in  the  implementation  of  the \nProject.  Detailed  construction  and  installation  drawings  will  be  available \nunder  the  Project  and  will  be  in  line  with  specifications  in  the  design, \nsupply, and installation (turnkey) contracts.  \n \nProcurement of goods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  major  procurement  will  be \ndesign,  supply,  and  installation  contracts  for  the  transmission  lines  and \nsubstation  facilities.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least \nannually covering the next 18 months of procurement activity. \n \nThe  project  implementation  consulting  services  include  (i)  procurement \nand bidding for the tendering of design, supply, and installation contracts; \n(ii)  supervision  of \ntesting  and \ninstallation  and  construction, \ncommissioning,  and  quality  assurance;  and  (iii)  project  performance \n\nfinal \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nfinance \n\ntransmission  system \n\nthe  project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Azerenergy  will \nimplementation  consultants  entirely  from  its  own  resources,  and  engage \nthe consultants in accordance with its procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n \nThe  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  are  improved  system  performance, \nreduced \nlosses,  reduced  maintenance  costs, \ndeferred expenditure on new generation, reduction in imported power, and \nsalvage value from removal of the existing line. Such benefits have been \nestimated using extremely conservative figures. The economic base case \nshows the Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return of 14.8%. \n \nLong-term economic benefits are generated from the least-cost production \nof power, compared with developing an alternative energy source. Social \nimpacts include increased industrial production, opportunity for expansion \nof  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  higher  living  standards  through \nbetter  infrastructure  for  schools,  clinics,  local  services  for  lighting  and \ncommunication, and new job opportunities for local residents. \n \nThe Project is fully supported by the Government. The project components \nare  straightforward,  with  minimal  environmental  and  social  impacts.  The \nProject  was  designed  based  on  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i) \nmacroeconomic  growth  remains  stable,  (ii)  the  Government  remains \ncommitted to power sector reforms and development, (iii) the Government \nis  committed  to  establishing  cost-recovery  tariffs,  (iv)  Azerenergy  is \ncommitted to implementing social and environmental mitigation measures \nin  a  timely  manner,  (v)  the  project  and  financial  management  of \nAzerenergy is sound, and (vi) counterpart financing is adequate. \n \nRisks  to  the  Project  include  (i)  an  unexpected  increase  in  the  prices  of \ncommodities  and  raw  materials,  (ii)  a  delay \nin  procurement  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  caused  by  government  approvals,  and \n(iii) delays  in  implementation  of  social  and  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures.  The  Government  and  Azerenergy  have  taken  the  necessary \nmeasures to minimize these risks. The cabinet of ministers will coordinate \nthe  work  of  the  relevant  government  agencies  to  ensure  that  issues  are \nresolved  promptly.  Adequate  consulting  services  are  provided  to  assist \nAzerenergy  to  manage  implementation,  monitor  performance,  and  report \nto  ADB.  Price  contingency  funds  are  included  to  respond  to  unforeseen \ncost  changes.  Azerenergy  also  committed  to  implement  the  social  and \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  fully,  and  relevant  provisions  will  be \nincorporated in the civil works contracts. \n \nThe  project  financial  risk  is  low.  There  is  clear  evidence  that  the \nGovernment  has  had  considerable  success  in  transition  to  full  cost \nrecovery for the power utility by 2010. It also confirmed that no subsidies \nwill  be  given  to  Azerenergy  from  2008.  Tariff  reform  has  significantly \nsupported  the  target  of  achieving  a  financially  self-sustainable  power \nsector. The proposed Project, together with efforts from other development \npartners,  will  have  a  synergized  effect  on  enhancing  the  financial \nperformance of Azerenergy and will assist the Government in achieving its \nreform agenda. \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\fo\n46  00\u2019E\n\no\n50  00\u2019E\n\nG E O R G I A\n\nBalaken\n\nZagatala\n\nR U S S I A N\nF E D E R A T I O N\n\nGakh\n\nSheki\n\nOghuz\n\nMingechevir Reservoir\n\nGanja\n\nMingechevir\n\nGeranboy Yevlakh\n\nAgstafa\n\nGazakh\n\nShamkir\nReservoir\n\no\n\n41  00\u2019N\n\nTovuz\n\nGovla\n\nShamkir\n\nGadabey\n\nKhanlar\n\nDashkesan\n\nA R M E N I A\n\nKelbajar\n\nREPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\nPOWER TRANSMISSION\nENHANCEMENT PROJECT\n\nSa m ur River\n\nGusar\n\nGuba\n\nKhudat\n\nKhachmaz\n\nDevechi\n\nSiazan\n\nC A S P I A N     S E A\n\no\n\n41  00\u2019N\n\nGabala\n\nIsmailly\n\nKhyzy\n\nSumgayit\n\nAgdash\n\nUjar\n\nAgshu\n\nMaraza\n\nAbsheron\n\nKhyrdalan\n\nTerter\n\nAgdere\n\nBarda\n\nK\n\nu\n\nr \n\nR\ni\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nKyurdamir\n\nZardab\n\nPirallahl\nPirallahl Island\n\nChilov Island\n\nBAKU\n\nSangachal\n\nAgjabedi\n\nSabirabad\n\nHajiqabul\n\nAlyat\n\nSarisu Lake\n\nImishli\n\nAli-Bayramli\n\nSaatly\n\nAgdam\n\nKhojaly\n\nKhankendi\n\nShusha\n\nKhojavend\n\nLachin\n\nFuzuli\n\nBeilagan\n\nA r a z R iv er\n\nHeidarabad\n\nSharur\n\nA\n\nr\n\na\n\nz\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nQivraq\n\nShahbuz\n\nNAKHCHIVAN\nAUTONOMOUS\nREPUBLIC\n\nAraz Reservoir\n\nNakhchivan\nBabek\n\no\n\n39  00\u2019N\n\nGubadly\n\nJebrail\n\nZangilan\n\nJulfa\n\nOrdubad\n\nAraz River\n\nSalyan\n\nBilasuvar\n\nK\n\nu\n\nr\n\n \n\nR\n\ni\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\nNeftchala\n\nJalilabad\n\nMasally\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\nYardymly\n\nLerik\n\nLenkaran\n\nAstara\n\n0\n8\n-\n0\n7\n6\n5\n \nH\nR\n\nI R A N\n\no\n46  00\u2019E\n\nNational Capital\n\nCity/Town\n\nThermal Power Station\n\nHydropower Station\n\nSubstation\n\nProject Transmission Line\n\n500 kV Transmission Line\n\n300 kV Transmission Line\n\no\n\n39  00\u2019N\n\n220--230 kV Transmission Line\n\nRiver\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\no\n50  00\u2019E\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Azerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (Azerenergy),  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of \nAzerbaijan  for  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \n Azerbaijan is rich in diverse and abundant energy resources. The overall volume of the \ncountry\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves is estimated 4 billion tons of oil equivalent, while the natural gas \nreserves are 1.8 trillion cubic meters. Oil production dominates in the country\u2019s economy, with \n50 million tons of oil produced annually.  \n \nIn  2007,  gross  domestic  product  increased  by  25%,  supported  by  a  surge  in  crude  oil \n3. \nproduction (31.5% increase) and exports (39.1% rise). This was due to increased production in \nthe Azeri\u2013Chirag\u2013Guneshli oil field, whose offshore oil is exported to western markets through \nthe Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline. Natural gas production was increased by over 70% owing to \nthe  Shah  Deniz  offshore  bloc,  which  started  in  2007.  Overall,  the  economy  was  boosted  by \nlarge-scale  public  investment  in  infrastructure.  Public  investment  focused  on  social  sectors \n(health,  education)  and  improvement  of  public  utilities  (electricity,  heating,  water  supply,  and \nsanitation).   \n \n4. \n The  power  sector,  along  with  the  oil  sector,  plays  a  leading  role  in  Azerbaijan\u2019s  social \nand  economic  growth.  The  energy  sector  plays  a  central  role  in  the  economy,  contributing  to \none  third  of  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  in  2007,  making  it  the  economy\u2019s  largest \nsegment. Development of the power sector has been one of the Government\u2019s priorities.  \n \n5. \nAzerenergy is the state-owned enterprise responsible for operation and management of \nthe  high-voltage  transmission  network  and  major  thermal  and  hydropower  generation  plants. \nAzerenergy  owns  major  generation  and  all  transmission  assets,  with  the  exception  of  two \nhydropower  plants  run  by  the  private  sector.  Of  the  total  installed  generation  capacity  in \nAzerbaijan,  which  reached  5,508  megawatts  (MW)  by  March  2008,  Azerenergy  owns  98.5% \nincluding  six  thermal  power  plants  (3,956  MW),  four  hydropower  plants  (1,018 MW),  and  five \nmodular  power  plants  (452  MW).  The  power  transmission  and  distribution  grid  consists  of \nsubstations and transmission lines from 400 volts (V) to 500 kilovolts (kV), with a total length of \n110,000 kilometers (km). It has an extensive power transmission system connected to those of \nits neighbors, which allows import of power from the Iran, Russian Federation, and Turkey. \n \n6. \nThe  electricity  production  of  Azerbaijan  in  2007  was  21,416  gigawatt-hours  (GWh),  of \nwhich 19,053 GWh (89% of total) was generated from thermal power and 2,363 GWh (11% of \ntotal) from hydropower. In 2007, about 360 GWh of electricity energy was imported from abroad. \nThe  imported  energy  was  primarily  from  Iran  to  supply  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic, \nwhich  does  not  have  direct  access  to  the  national  power  network,  and  also  from  the  Russian \nFederation with which Azerbaijan maintains an annual balance of import and export. The total \nexport electricity energy to Iran and the Russian Federation was 727 GWh. The total domestic \nelectricity  consumption  in  2007  was  19,000  GWh.  The  average  growth  rate  of  domestic \nelectricity demand is expected to be about 4.7% annually through 2015.  \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\nWhile the country has been successful in engaging the private sector for developing and \n7. \nexporting its oil and gas resources, the domestic power sector is threatened by unreliable and \ninadequate  power  supply  mainly  because  of  deterioration  of  power  facilities,  inadequate \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation,  inadequate  investment,  and  inefficient  utilization  of  energy \nresources.  This  undermines  industrial  competitiveness  and  constrains  economic  growth. \nEffective  generation  capacity  has  shrunk  because  of  insufficient  funds  for  rehabilitation  and \ncapacity  addition.  Low  power  plant  efficiency  and  high  losses  of  transmission  and  distribution \nlead to wastage of fossil fuels that could have been exported, and nearly double the emissions \nof greenhouse gas and other pollutants that damage the regional and global environment. \n \n8. \nDeterioration  of  Power  Facilities.  Over 20% of all energy equipment and over half of \nthe network facilities are well beyond their useful life. This inevitably reduces the reliability and \nefficiency of the power network operation. The high level of physical wear of the equipment at \npower  plants  and  networks  leads  to  frequent  power  failures  in  populated  areas  and  affects \neconomic activities. The inadequate capacity of transmission lines also results in a shortage of \nreserves  in  the  stability  of  the  power  system,  increasing  the  potential  risk  of  power  system \noperation. \n \n9. \nInadequate  Maintenance  and  Rehabilitation.  The  power  sector  has  suffered  from \ninadequate funding to perform essential maintenance functions and introduce new technology. \nThe  result  has  been  a  distinct  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  the  infrastructure  and  associated \ndeterioration in the quality of service. The power grid is becoming increasingly exposed to the \nrisk  of  systemic  collapse.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  transmission  facilities  could \nsignificantly reduce the risk of system failure. \n \n10. \nInefficient Utilization of Energy  Resources. Another prominent problem of the power \nnetwork  is  the  shortage  of  peak  power  supply.  Hydropower  plants,  with  only  19%  of  the \navailable  capacity  of  all  power  generation  and  lower  reliability  caused  by  aging  of  equipment, \ncannot meet peak demands adequately. Large thermal power plants have to participate in the \nshifting  operation,  thus  reducing  the  efficiency  and  stability  of  generating  units  and  excessive \nconsumption of fuels. Because of lack of sufficient peak power supply, Azerenergy has to import \npower from abroad in the peak hours as well as the winter season with higher demand. \n \n11. \nInsufficient  and  Unreliable  Power  Supply.  Today,  about  49%  of  the  Azerbaijan\u2019s \n8.5 million people live in rural areas, often with insufficient access to quality basic services. Lack \nof sufficient power, gas, and heat has aggravated the regional imbalance in the country. Poor \nquality and unreliable electricity supply inhibits industrial, agricultural, and commercial activities, \nconstraining economic growth and employment opportunities in regional areas. The unreliability \nof electricity supply remains a constraint to business operation and daily life. Almost 7% of total \nannual sales were lost because of power outages. Some areas of the country receive only a few \nhours of electricity a day, and there are frequent localized outages and occasional widespread \nsystem  failures.  Detailed  analysis  of  the  power  sector  is  in  Appendix  2  and  problem  tree \nanalysis is in Appendix 3. \n \nGovernment  Strategies  and  Policies.  The  principle  objectives  of  the  power  sector \n12. \ndevelopment  are  to  utilize  domestic  energy  resources  efficiently,  protect  the  country\u2019s  energy \nsecurity,  and  ensure  the  delivery  of  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  services  for  sustained \neconomic  growth.  To  accelerate  the  power  sector  reform  and  development,  the  Government \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nto  propose \n\nhas set the overall policy framework for the power sector development, which has the following \ncomponents: (i) sector restructuring to separate the ownership and management of generation; \ntransmission,  and  distribution;  (ii)  development  of  a  regulatory  framework  and  institutions  to \npromote  competition  and  ensure  the  financial  viability  of  sector  enterprises;  (iii)  introduction  of \ntargeted social protection programs to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs on vulnerable groups; \nand  (iv)  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  the  operation  and  financing  of  generation  and \ndistribution facilities. Since 2005, the Government has been implementing reforms in the utilities \nand  infrastructure  sectors,  through  financial  restructuring  of  the  large  natural  monopolies; \nseparation  of  commercial  and  regulatory  functions;  and  introduction  of  a  proper  regulatory \nframework. Progress on sector restructuring has been achieved, including establishment of four \nregional  distribution  companies,  private  sector  operation  in  generation,  and  creation  of  the \nMinistry  of  Economic  Development  responsible  for  energy  sector  policy  making,  pricing  and \ntariffs, licensing, and management of fixed assets. The Tariff Council, chaired by the Ministry of \nEconomic  Development,  has  authority \ntariff  adjustments,  define  customer \ncategories,  and  adopt  cost-reflective  tariff  design.  Furthermore,  the  Government  has  ordered \nthat all large companies have to change to international financial reporting standards (IFRS) by \nJanuary 2008, and all government ministries have to implement the IFRS by January 2009. This \nwill be under the management and control of the Ministry of Finance. \n \n13. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  using  energy  resources  efficiently,  and \nacknowledges that the delivery of affordable utility service of acceptable quality is an essential \nrequirement in enhancing the living standards of the population. Consequently, the Government \nhas developed a state program for development of fuel and energy sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u2013\n2015),1 which identifies and sets development targets for the various subsectors.  \n \n14. \nThe  state  program  envisages  the  development  of  the  power  sector  and  plans  to \nrestructure  the  sector,  expand  generation  and  transmission  facilities,  and  introduce  a  modern \nmanagement system, including (i) development of new combined cycle gas turbine generation \nunits  and  hydropower  generation  capacities;  (ii)  modernization  and  reconstruction  of  power \nfacilities\u2014increasing  efficiency  and  prolonging  useful  life  and  expanding  available  capacities; \n(iii) promoting the development of small hydropower and other renewable energy sources (wind \nand  solar)  to  supplement  the  energy  balance;  (iv)  construction  of  new  substations  and \ntransmission  lines  to  expand  transmission  and  distribution  networks;  (v)  reconstruction  and \nupgrade  of  dispatch  control  systems;  (vi)  strengthening  cross-border  links  with  Russian  and \nIranian  grids  to  increase  power  trade  capacity;  (vii)  increasing  investments  for  energy  sector \ndevelopment  and  attracting  foreign  investments;  and  (viii)  expanding  regional  cooperation  and \nparticipating in the formation of regional energy markets. \n \n15. \nThe  Government  has  established  a  medium-term  tariff  policy  that  incorporates  a \ntransition  to  full  cost  recovery  for  utility  service  providers  by  2010,  to  make  the  power  sector \nfinancially self-sustainable. As the economy continues to expand, the purchasing power of the \npopulation  will  continue  to  increase  and,  with  it,  the  capacity  to  pay  higher  prices  for  utility \nservices. In addition, the development and implementation of a targeted social safety net that is \nunder  way  will  ensure  that  the  most  vulnerable  continue  to  be  able  to  afford  essential  utility \nservices  as  prices  rise  towards,  and  eventually  reach  full  cost  recovery  levels.  Taking  into \naccount  these  considerations  and  under  joint  efforts  from  development  partners,  the \nGovernment  took  a  number  of  measures  to  curtail  implicit  energy  subsidies,  including  the \nincrease in energy and utilities prices in January 2007. The current wholesale electricity tariff is \nAZN0.041  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  ($0.051  per  kWh)  and  the  retail  electricity  tariff  is  AZN0.06 \n\n                                                 \n1  Cabinet of Ministers. 2005.

This led to a reduction in energy subsidies from 21% in 2006 to an \nestimated 11% in 2007. Azerenergy has confirmed that no subsidies will be received for 2008. \nThe collection of utility payments has also been substantially improved from about 40% to 90%. \nThe implementation of the proposed Project will further improve the power sector performance \nand assist the Government to achieve its committed reform agenda. \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \nAn unreliable and inefficient power network is a bottleneck to sustained economic growth \n16. \nand rapid poverty reduction. With support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners, a comprehensive energy sector road map2 was prepared in 2006, which \nidentified  three  key  areas  for  ADB  assistance:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  power  grid  for \nimprovement of power supply quality and loss reduction, (ii) development of renewable energy, \nand  (iii)  improvement  of  demand-side  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation.  The \nGovernment expressed interest in cooperation with ADB to address these matters, and ADB is \nexploring  suitable  investment  projects  through  public  and  private  sector  operation.  The  power \ntransmission  subsector  in  Azerbaijan  has  substantial  investment  demand  in  terms  of \nstrengthening the backbone power grid, reducing losses and enhancing energy efficiency, and \nminimizing  environmental  impacts.  State-of-the-art  technology  will  also  be  needed  to  transfer \npower with minimal losses and provide adequate power supply to consumers. \n \n17. \nThe  220  kV  Mingechevir-1  transmission  line  was  put  into  service  in  1949,  and  the \nMingechevir-2 transmission line in 1954. These two single circuit transmission lines provide the \ntransmission  of  electric  power  with  a  total  capacity  of  250  MW  from  Mingechevir  hydropower \nstation to the Absheron economic region, which is closest to the capital city of Baku and has the \nhighest electricity consumption. Both lines were partially renovated in the 1980s. However, most \nsegments  remain  unchanged,  with  a  large  number  of  defective  pylons,  insulators,  and  wires, \nleading to increased power losses and higher voltage drops. A large number of foundations of \ntowers were damaged as a result of landslides and floods. Statistical analysis of power failures \nconcluded that the technical conditions of both lines are inadequate and past their useful life. In \naddition, increased power demand causes these lines to be frequently overloaded, which leads \nto an increase of 6%\u20137% in losses, with frequent outages (8\u201317 times annually). Therefore, the \ntransmission  capacity  must  be  expanded  to  deliver  adequate  and  reliable  power  supply.  The \npower system studies concluded that construction of a new double circuit 220 kV transmission \nline to replace the aged existing lines used for 60 years would be the most suitable and least-\ncost option, which will increase transmission capacity by 300 MW and reduce power losses by \n25 GWh. The increase in transmission capacity will remove the bottleneck of the transmission \ncapacity of the backbone power networks. It is expected that by 2012, the total annual electricity \nsupply in the project area could be increased by about 1,000 GWh accordingly. The electricity \nenergy generated from the Mingechevir hydropower plant could also be increased by 200 GWh \nannually, from 1,200 GWh to 1,400 GWh. \n \n18. \nThe power supply in the central region is provided through the 110 kV transmission lines \nfrom  Akhsu  220/110  kV  substation,  covering  Akhsu,  Ujar,  Geokchai,  and  other  administrative \nregions with a total population of 0.5 million. The majority of these transmission lines were built \nin  the  1950s\u20131960s  and  are  now  overloaded,  with  considerable  risks  including  low  voltage  in \ndistribution  networks,  high  losses,  and  frequent  outages.  In  peak  hours,  the  voltage  of  the \ndistribution network is only 92\u201394 kV, or 85% of the standards, lower than the minimum allowed \nvoltage (104.5 kV) for normal operating conditions. Azerenergy has studied various options for \nreliable power supply in the central region, including construction of new thermal power plants, \n                                                 \n2   Valiyev, Vilayat. 2006.

External assistance has focused on support for gas-\nfired  and  hydropower  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects.  The  World  Bank \nhelped  to  improve  the  management  of  the  energy  system  and  restructure  the  relevant \ninstitutions.  EBRD  provided  two  loans  for  the  rehabilitation  of  two  hydropower  plants,  and  the \nGovernment of Japan provided two loans to finance the gas combined-cycle power plant. KfW \nalso provided a loan for the power transmission rehabilitation program.  \n \n20. \nBesides  these,  ADB,  EBRD,  European  Union,  and  the  World  Bank  have  provided \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  feasibility  studies  and  capacity  development.  ADB  has  been \nactively involved in policy dialogue with the Government since 2005. A project preparatory TA3 \nfor renewable energy development was implemented successfully, which assessed the potential \nand options for renewable energy development and identified pilot small hydropower projects to \nbe developed. The TA also assessed the government policy framework, developed a road map \nfor implementation of renewable energy projects, and prepared a standardized power purchase \nagreement  and  other  policy  documents.  The  Government  is  considering  adopting  an \nappropriate investment modality and identifying the implementing agency, and will seek ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support. \n\n21. \nThe  World  Bank  assistance  focuses  on  the  establishment  of  a  full  cost  recovery  tariff \npolicy,  implementing  IFRS,  creating  an  appropriate  regulatory  environment,  and  strengthening \nprivate  participation  in  the  provision  of  utility  services.  The  European  Union  is  also  supporting \nthe Ministry of Industry and Energy to enhance its capacity to develop and implement a national \nenergy  strategy  and  public  sector  reform  for  attracting  foreign  investments  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n22. \nThe Project was prepared and will be implemented in coordination with the external aid \nagencies  active  in  the  power  sector.  During  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  project  team  frequently \nconsulted with counterparts on policy reforms, project design, and capacity development in the \nthe \nsector.  The  Project  will  complement \neffectiveness  of  external  assistance,  and  synergize \ninstitutional  strengthening  of \nAzerenergy. \n \nThrough  the  synergized  external  assistance  from  international  financing  agencies, \n23. \nseveral  key  policy  initiatives  have  resulted.  The  Government  has  adopted  and  approved  a \npreliminary  energy  sector  strategy  and  policy  framework,  established  a  full  cost  recovery  tariff \npolicy,  and  is  continually  improving  sector  governance.  Sound  procurement  procedures  and  a \nfinancial management and audit system have been introduced in the energy sector. Details of \nexternal assistance to the power sector are in Appendix 4.  \n\nthe  ongoing  assistance  programs, \nthe \n\nimprove \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2005.

The  2006 \ncountry strategy and program update for Azerbaijan4 indicated that the Government requested \nADB support for energy within an expanded lending program. The proposed power transmission \nproject is under the Government strategic priority, and is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nenergy policy.5  \n \nADB  has  no  lending  operations  in  the  Azerbaijan  energy  sector  yet  and  the  Project \n25. \nprovides  a  unique  opportunity  to  enter  it.  Currently,  private  sector  funding  in  Azerbaijan  is  not \nsufficient  to fully  rehabilitate  the  power  system.  ADB  can  contribute  to fill  the  funding  gap  and \nwork  with  the  Government  and  development  partners  to  improve  the  structural,  legal,  and \nregulatory framework needed to attract private sector funding in the sector. ADB has extensive \nexperience in the design and implementation of transmission projects in its developing member \ncountries,  with  lessons  that  are  directly  applicable  to  Azerbaijan.  The  Project  will  complement \nother ADB support for infrastructure, including the development of roads and regional towns. \n \n26. \nThe Project targets key strategic transmission lines, which are severely deteriorated and \nneed to be rehabilitated on a priority basis. It will also contribute to optimizing domestic energy \nresource  utilization  and  reducing  fossil  fuel  consumption  and  power  imports.  The  current \nAzerbaijan  power  system  is  not  being  operated  optimally  because  of  constraints  on  existing \ncomponents  of  the  transmission  network.  Hydropower  energy  generated  in  the  west  region  is \nnot delivered efficiently to the central region where demand is increasing rapidly. Replacement \nof  the  220  kV  transmission  lines  would  allow  the  existing  Mingechevir  hydropower  plant  (360 \nMW) to increase its available outputs to the optimal level (420 MW)\u2014peak power supply could \nbe efficiently enhanced, while power energy generated from the gas and oil fired plants in the \ncentral  and  east  regions  could  be  reduced.  This  would  permit  optimal  utilization  of  the  grid \nnetworks and generation capacity by reducing the shifting operation time of large thermal power \nplants,  thus  improving  the  efficiency  and  stability  of  generation  units  and  reducing  excessive \nconsumption  of  fuels.  The  saved  fuels  including  gas  and  oil  would  be  exported  to  increase \ngovernment revenue. Therefore, Azerenergy and the country would benefit from savings in fuel \nexpenditures, improved energy efficiency, and reduced environmental pollution. \n \n27. \nAzerbaijan  has  actively  participated  in  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation. \nThe Government is also involved in ADB regional TA on promoting renewable energy, energy \nefficiency,  and  greenhouse  gas  abatement;  and  has  committed  itself  to  exploring  the  use  of \nrenewable energy as part of its generation expansion.6 Implementation of the proposed Project \nis helping to reinforce the relationship between Azerbaijan and ADB in the energy sector, and \nestablish the conditions for expansion of long-term cooperation.  \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n \n28. \nADB has not yet provided loans to the energy sector of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, ADB \nhas  accumulated  substantial  experience  in  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  and \nunderstanding  of  problems  in  the  energy  sector  in  other  countries  in  the  region.  Relevant \nlessons learned are that (i) project components shall be carefully designed and evaluated based \non  in-depth  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  (including  land  acquisition  and \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

In addition, early attention on procurement matters, \nincluding bid documents preparation and review procedures, will be given to avoid delays. Close \nfollow-up during project engineering designs, construction of civil works, and installation should \nensure timely corrective measures where needed and early completion of project components. \n \n29. \nAzerbaijan  has  embarked  on  energy  sector  reforms.  However,  the  process  of \nrestructuring, legal and regulatory reforms, and enhancement of utility financial performances is \na progression that is mainly being supported by other development partners, including the World \nBank  and  the  European  Union.  The  Project  would  complement  these  efforts  with  needed \ninvestment  in  transmission  network  enhancement.  This  integration  of  policy  and  investment \nsupport  is  designed  to  maximize  their  combined  effect  on  the  sector's  financial  position  and \nsustainability of sector reforms. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n30. \nThe  Project  was  developed  following  technical,  economic,  and  financial  studies  that \nhave  taken  into  consideration  environmental  and  social  aspects.  The  proposed  Project  will \nconstruct  a  double  circuit  220  kV  transmission  line  with  a  total  length  of  280  km  between \nMingechevir  hydropower  plant  and  the  500/330/220  kV  Absheron  substation  to  replace  the \nexisting 220 kV transmission lines. It will also construct a 220/110 kV substation at Agdash and \nexpand Absheron substation. The new 220 kV transmission line will be built at the same corridor \nof  the  existing  old  lines,  and  the  latter  lines  will  be  demolished  before  and  during  the \nconstruction of new lines. The existing power supply will be shifted to other transmission lines \nand the deficient parts will be supplied from increase of imported power. \n \nThe  Project  aims  to  facilitate  the  country\u2019s  economic  development  by  strengthening \n31. \ninfrastructure  development,  removing  the  bottleneck  of power  transmission,  and  improving  the \nefficiency  of  services.  The  project  impacts  are  to  improve  the  power  transmission  system  to \nprovide  reliable  and  adequate  electricity  for  sustained  economic  growth.  It  will  strengthen  the \nbackbone power transmission network in the west-to-east direction, which is crucial for ensuring \nthe  required  stability  of  power  supply  to  consumers  in  the  key  Azeri  industrial  and  economic \nhub. The Project is an integral part of Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector development strategy. \n \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  an  expanded  and  strengthened  backbone  220  kV  power \n32. \ntransmission  and  distribution  network  with  transmission  bottlenecks  removed  and  losses \nreduced. \n \nB. \n \n33. \n \n\nThe outputs of the Project are summarized below:  \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n220  kV  transmission  line.

The ADB loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  guarantee  agreements. \nAzerenergy  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government of Azerbaijan will provide the sovereign \nguarantee. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. Azerenergy will finance the \nremaining  costs  including  consulting  services,  local  taxes  and  duties,  interest  during \nconstruction,  and  contingencies,  from  its  own  resources  of  an  estimated  $80  million.  The \nproposed financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 5. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources \n\nAzerenergy a \n \n \na   Includes value added tax, other taxes and duties, price contingencies, and interest during construction. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\n \n160.0 \n80.0 \n240.0 \n\n   % \n \n67 \n33 \n100 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n36. \nAzerenergy will be the executing agency. Azerenergy has been the executing agency for \nsix investment projects financed by the World Bank, EBRD, KfW, IsDB, and JBIC. The capacity \nof Azerenergy and its staff to undertake the project implementation responsibilities is considered \nsatisfactory,  given  their  adequate  experience  with  previous  projects  and  the  staff\u2019s  technical \nskills.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation, \nindicating that Azerenergy has satisfactory management capacity and systems for financial and \naccounting management, reporting, auditing, and internal controls. \n \n37. \nA project management unit (PMU) will be established, headed by a project manager and \nstaffed  by  specialists  in  technical,  financial,  procurement,  social,  and  environmental  matters. \nThe PMU will report to the chief engineer or deputy president of Azerenergy. The PMU will be \nresponsible \nimplementation,  comprising  procurement,  contract \nsupervision  and  management,  project  social  and  environmental  management,  and  project \nfinancial  management,  including  project  accounting,  financial  reporting,  loan  disbursements, \nand  arrangements  for  external  audits.  Relevant  international  practices  and  standards  will  be \nadhered to in the implementation of the Project. Detailed construction and installation drawings \nwill  be  available  under  the  Project  and  will  be  in  line  with  specifications  in  the  engineering, \nprocurement, and commissioning contracts. \n \n \n \n\nfor  day-to-day  project \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n38. \nThe Project will be implemented around 3 years starting in January 2009. Physical works \nare  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2011  and  the  loan  utilization  period  will  be  up  to \nJune 2012. Detailed engineering designs, surveys, investigations, will start in the fourth quarter \nof 2008. The civil works are expected to commence in the second quarter of 2009. The project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \n39. \nADB-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding procedures \nwill  be  followed  for  civil  work  contracts  costing  $3  million  equivalent  or  more.  Contracts \nestimated  at  less  than  $3  million  will  be  awarded  using  national  competitive  bidding  under \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Law  of  27  December  2001  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nprocurement plan will be updated at least annually, covering the next 18 months of procurement \nactivity. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n40. \nThe  operation  of  transmission  lines  and  substations  is  highly  integrated  because  of \ntechnical specifications. Proper system performance of the transmission and substation facilities \nalso  requires  strong  integration  between  the  equipment  suppliers  and  the  construction \ncontractors.  The  successful  bidder  will  be  required  to  warrant  performance  of  the  lines  and \nelectrical  equipment,  which  reduces  the  risk  to  Azerenergy.  Therefore,  a  plant  design,  supply, \nand  install  (turnkey)  contracting  approach  has  been  taken  to  ensure  proper  system  design \nintegration  and  facility  performance.  A  plant  contracting  approach  also  has  the  advantage  of \nensuring that the contractor has adequate experience of civil works requirements and in-depth \nknowledge of equipment to be installed, and can ensure better design integration. To facilitate \nproject  implementation  and  administration  in  a  more  efficient  and  economical  manner,  the \nproject subcomponents are packaged into one single plant (turnkey) contract. This approach will \nbe  more  likely  to  attract  more  qualified  national  and  international  bidders  and  lower  bid  prices \nbecause of the award of multiple subcomponents.     \n \nThe  single  plant  (turnkey)  contract  for  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and \n41. \nsubstation  facilities  will  be  awarded  using  international  competitive  bidding  following  ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding document: single-stage bidding procedure. \n \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n42. \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  Azerenergy  has  requested  ADB  approval  for \nadvance  contracting  for  the  ADB-financed  components.  This  will  enable  Azerenergy  to  initiate \nthe procurement process.  \n \n43. \nAzerenergy has also requested ADB for retroactive financing for expenditures in respect \nof civil works if incurred prior to effectiveness of the loan agreement. Reimbursement by ADB of \nany payments made by Azerenergy under the contract will not exceed 20% of the loan amount \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nsafeguard  policies,  and  were  incurred  not  earlier  than  12  months  prior  to  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement.  The  Government  and  Azerenergy  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n44. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  project  implementation  support  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  Key  tasks  include  (i) procurement  and  bidding  for  the  tendering  of  plant  design, \nsupply,  and  installation  contracts;  (ii)  supervision  of  construction,  testing  and  commissioning, \nand  quality  assurance;  (iii)  monitoring  of  project  implementation  and  performance;  and \n(iv) capacity  development.  The  capacity  development  component  will \ninvolve  project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  activities,  including  safeguards  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \ntraining on transmission system operations, and maintenance. The outline terms of reference for \nproject implementation consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n45. \nBecause of the power system operation requirement, Azerenergy plans to complete the \nconstruction  of  transmission  and  substation  facilities  by  the  end  of  2011.  To  expedite  project \nimplementation, Azerenergy will finance the project implementation consultants entirely from its \nown  resources,  and  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB.  DECON, 7 an  international  consulting  firm,  has  been  engaged  by  Azerenergy  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  under  a  transmission  line  project  financed  by  KfW.  The \nconsultants  have  adequate  professional  qualifications  and  satisfactory  performance  in  the \nassignment.  The  consulting  services  under  the  Project  represent  a  very  similar  technical \napproach  and  professional  expertise  with  the  ongoing  assignment.  Azerenergy  intends  to \nengage  this  firm  directly  through  negotiation.  The  consulting  firm  has  submitted  technical  and \nfinancial  proposals  based  on  the  terms  of  reference.  This  single-source  selection  approach  is \nconsidered appropriate and cost-effective, given that (i) the consultants are selected based on \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  have  the  necessary  professional  qualifications,  (ii)  the \nconsultants will carry out the assignment in accordance with the agreed schedule, and (iii) the \nscope  of  the  services  is  consistent  with  the  needs  of  the  Project.  The  consultant\u2019s  experience \nand competence have been assessed and found adequate to the proposed assignment. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n46. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  Azerenergy  and  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \nThe  Government  and  Azerenergy  agreed  to  take  additional  measures  to  improve \n47. \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  under  the  Project.  These  measures  include \n(i) independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements; \n(ii) decisions on all procurement-related matters being taken by the tendering committee, which \ncomprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance, \nMinistry of Industry and Energy, and State Procurement Agency; (iii) verification of contractors\u2019 \npayment  claims  by  the  supervision  consultant  in  accordance  with  contract  specifications; \n(iv) timely  disclosure  of  information  on  selection  of  consultants  and  contractors  through  local \n\n                                                 \n7   DECON, a European consulting firm  with headquarters in  Germany, has  a 35-year  history of implementing more \nthan  700  projects  at  home  and  abroad.  The  focus  of  DECON\u2019s  business  activities  is  on  electricity  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution as well as renewable energy and energy policy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nnewspapers;  and  (v)  publication  of  the  status  of  procurements  and  awards  of  contracts  on \nAzerenergy\u2019s website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n48. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To reduce cash flow difficulties in Azerenergy \nand facilitate project implementation, the imprest account procedures described in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook will be followed. An imprest account will be established at the National \nBank  of  Azerbaijan  or  a  commercial  bank  in  Azerbaijan  acceptable  to  ADB  after  loan \neffectiveness,  and  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook.  The  total advance  will  not  exceed  ADB\u2019s  estimated  share  of  eligible \nproject expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% \nof  the  amount  of  the  loan,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure, as described in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, will be followed to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nof $100,000 equivalent and below. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \nAzerenergy  agreed  to  adhere  to  sound  financial  management  requirements  during \n49. \nimplementation of the Project. Azerenergy will maintain separate project records and accounts \nadequate  to  identify  the  (i)  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  financing \nresources  received,  (iii)  expenses  incurred  on  the  components  of  the  Project,  and  (iv)  use  of \ncounterpart funds. Azerenergy will engage independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to \naudit project accounts and financial statements annually, and will arrange a periodic or annual \naudit of statement of expenditures transactions. Azerenergy will submit to ADB certified copies \nof  audited  annual  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  as  well  as  the  auditor\u2019s \nreport  in  English,  including  the  proposed  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure,  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year  during \nimplementation. Azerenergy was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of audited \nannual project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loan in case of noncompliance with the requirements. \n \n50. \nAzerenergy will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports, which will include \n(i)  a  narrative  description  of  progress  made  during  the  reporting  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the \nimplementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) activities and actions \nto  be  undertaken  in  the  next  reporting  period.  Azerenergy  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a \nproject completion report within 3 months of project completion. \n \n\n9. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n51. \n A  set  of  targets  and  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  performance \nwere discussed with Azerenergy during fact-finding (key performance targets and indicators are \nin Appendix 1). Azerenergy will (i) engage project implementation consultants for monitoring and \nevaluation by the end of 2008; (ii) collect additional data from relevant agencies, including local \ngovernments  and  statistics  bureaus,  to  measure  the  performance  indicators  at  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion of the Project; and (iii) report to ADB key findings on a \nquarterly basis. Azerenergy, with the assistance of the supervision consultant, will monitor and \nevaluate  project  impacts  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively  and \nbenefits maximized. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n52. \nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  of  loan  approval,  and  a  review \nmission  every  6  months.  The  Government,  Azerenergy,  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  in  late  2009.  The  midterm  review  will  focus  on  (i)  project  impacts, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) sector reform and performance, (iv) performance of consultants \nand  contractors,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  covenants  in  the  loan  agreement,  and  (vi)  the \nneed  for  any  midcourse  changes  in  the  scope  or  schedule  of  the  Project  to  ensure  full \nachievement of its impact. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  proposed  Project  will  need  to  demonstrate  economic  viability  and  sustainability  in \n\n53. \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.8 \n \n54. \nEconomic  analysis  of  Azerenergy\u2019s  proposed  Project  under  the  state  program  for \ndevelopment  of  fuel  and  energy  sector  in  Azerbaijan  (2005\u20132015)  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Azerenergy  identifies \nbenefits to the replacement transmission line that are within the context of the state program for \nenergy  transmission.  However,  there  is  no  numerical  analysis  to  support  these  benefits  other \nthan  that  the  Project  will  increase  the  capacity  of  the  power  network  and  reduce  losses  of \ncapacity  and  electric  energy.  The  issue  of  lack  of  peak  capacity  was  also  identified,  which \nrequires that peak demand is met by importing energy from the Russian Federation. It is on this \nbasis that the justification of the replacement transmission lines is proposed, by evaluating the \navoidable cost of the imported peak power. The Project has an estimated economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of 14.8%, indicating that it is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis revealed \nthat  expected  economic  outcomes  are  robust  under  a  range  of  downside  scenarios,  reflecting \nthe strong link between an adequate electricity supply and economic growth. A summary of the \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \nB. \n \n55. \nFinancial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.9 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been \nexpressed  at  2007  prices.  Cost  streams  used  to  determine  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR),  i.e.,  capital  investment,  and  operations and  maintenance,  reflect  the  cost of  delivering \nthe estimated benefits. The tariff for electricity has been assumed as the difference between the \ncost  of  imported  electricity  and  the  cost  of  own  generation  of  electricity  and  has  been  set  at \n$0.036 per kWh. The tariff is applied to the volume of 650 GWh\u2014assuming that the Project will \nenable domestic generation to replace imports. \n \nThe  FIRR  of  11.69%  compares  favorably  with  the  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of \n56. \ncapital  (WACC)  of  2.45%  indicating  financial  viability  for  the  Project.  Financial  viability  was \ngauged by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-project investment \nscenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  replacement  of  imported  electricity  and \nreduction in operating expenditures. Nonquantifiable financial benefits such as quality of power \n\nFinancial Analysis  \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 1997.

A  summary  of  the  financial  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n57. \nSensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRRs are robust with (i) a 10% increase \nin  capital  costs,  (ii)  a  10-year  benefit  stream  (instead  of  20  years),  (iii)  LIBOR  increasing  by \n10%,  and  (iv)  net  benefits  decreasing  by  10%.  Two  extreme  scenarios  have  also  been  run \nwhere  both  benefits  and  capital  costs  were  reduced  to  a  point  where  the  net  present  value \n(NPV) of free cash flow was set to zero. Both scenarios came out with acceptable FIRRs. The \nsensitivity analysis can be found in Table 3 below. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary Results of Financial Analysis \n\n \n\nItem \n\nBase \nCase \n\nBenefits \nreduced to \n10 year \n\nLIBOR  \nincrease \nby 10% \n\nCAPEX \n+10% \n\nBenefit \nminus 10%\n\n2.45\nWACC (%) \n10.46\nFIRR (%) \n232.20\nNPV ($ million) \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, LIBOR = London interbank offered \nrate, NPV =net present value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2.45 \n10.58 \n260.00 \n\n2.45 \n11.69 \n277.20 \n\n6.75\n12.41\n112.30\n\n2.45\n3.32\n10.20\n\nFinancial Management and Sustainability of Azerenergy \n\n \n58. \nFor each of the scenarios in Table 3, the FIRR is greater than the WACC and the NPV is \npositive. Therefore, it can be concluded that, in the all unlikely circumstances including the most \nnegative  scenario  (i)  the  expected  benefit  stream  will  be  10  years  instead  of  20  years;  (ii)  the \nProject is financially viable; and (iii) the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to \ncover the projected costs, including loan interest and principal repayment requirements. \n \nTwo additional scenarios have been calculated to investigate at what level the expected \n59. \nbenefits should decrease, or at what level capital expenditures should be increased to get the \nNPV  to  zero.  The  calculations  show  that  this  level  will  be  achieved  if  benefits  are  reduced  by \n60%  or  capital  expenditures  increase  more  than  2.5  times,  which  may  be  concluded  as \nextremely unlikely. \n \nC. \n \nPrior  to  the  country\u2019s  independence,  Azerenergy  was  administratively  a  government \n60. \nagency.  In  1996,  it  became  an  open  joint-stock  company.  Although  it  is  fully  owned  by  the \nGovernment,  and  senior  management  is  handpicked  by  the  Government,  Azerenergy  enjoys \nrelative  autonomous  status  according  to  its  charter.  The  detailed  corporate  and  organizational \nstructure of Azerenergy and its financial performance are in Supplementary Appendixes D and \nE.  \n \n61. \nAzerenergy  generates  electric  power.  It  transmits  and  sells  electricity  directly  to \nconsumers  as  well  as  in  bulk  to  power  distribution  companies.  Based  on  the  agreements, \ndistribution  companies  deliver  electricity  to  retail  consumers  within  their  service  areas. \nAzerenergy  comprises  20  generation  and  transmission  entities  and  the  energy  management \nnetwork;  these  are  under  the  direct  financial  control  of  Azerenergy.  The  revenue  collection  of \nthese  entities  is  centralized  and  managed  directly  by  the  head  office  of  Azerenergy.  The  nine \nregional  distribution  entities  and  Nakhchivan  autonomy  agency  collect  their  own  revenue  and \ntherefore  pay  corporate  income  tax  as  individual  entities.  There  are  also  seven  decentralized \nenterprises  under  the  umbrella  of  Azerenergy\u2014Research  Centre,  Construction  Enterprise, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nRepair and Construction Enterprise, Security Service Enterprise, Supply Entity, Energy Service \nSupply Entity, and Research Institute. The total number of employees in 2007 was 8,092. \n \n62. \nTwo  distribution  companies\u2014Joint-Stock  Company  (JSC)  Baku  Electricshebeke  and \nJSC  Sumgait  Electricshebeke\u2014are  outside  Azerenergy  management  control  and  operate  as \nseparate  entities.  Azerenergy  concluded  contracts  with  JSC  Baku  Electricshebeke  and  JSC \nSumgait Electricshebeke for the transmission of electricity in Baku and Sumgait cities. \n \n\n1. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\n \n63. \nAzerenergy\u2019s overall financial performance has been satisfactory in the past 3 years and \ntotal revenue has increased steadily because of the increase in tariffs as well as the reduction in \nimported energy, thus facilitating Azerenergy to expand its investment in the sector. Azerenergy \nexperienced a growth in total revenue in 2007 (AZN934 million), increasing by 222% over 2006. \n \n64. \nThe  company\u2019s  operating  results  also  improved  during  2007  because  of  the  overall \nincrease  in  tariffs.  The  cost  of  sales  amounted  to  AZN695  million  or  74%  of  total  revenue  in \n2007\u2014a significant improvement over 2006 where it was 185% of total turnover. \n \n65. \nThe ratio of equity to total equity and liabilities is improved slightly from 22% in 2006 to \n26% in 2007. Accordingly, the total liabilities to equity ratio also improved from 3.45 in 2006 to \n2.84 in 2007. The improvement of the company\u2019s gearing ratio is very important, and shows that \nthe  company  is  able  to  earn  enough  capital  using  long-term  borrowings  for  investment  in  the \nindustry. \n \n66. \nIn spite of significant improvement of the debt service coverage ratio which is up to 0.5 in \n2007  from  0.05  in  2006,  this  performance  indicator  is  still  low.  The  Government  has  been \nmaking  efforts  to  increase  tariffs  (thereby  increasing  cash  flow  available  for  debt  service) \nstarting in 2007. It is therefore believed that the debt service coverage ratio should be at a level \nacceptable  when  repayment  starts  in  2012.  More  detailed  analysis  of  Azerenergy\u2019s  financial \nperformance is in Appendix 11. \n\n \n2. \n\nFinancial Projections \n\n \n67. \nUp to 2006, retail tariffs were set below cost and as a result, Azerenergy was receiving \nsubsidies  from  the  Government.  At  the  beginning  of  2007,  the  Government  made  a  difficult \npolitical decision to set tariffs to cover costs with a 10% return. The results have been seen in \nAzerenergy\u2019s  financial  statements  in  2007  where  sales  significantly  increased  and  subsidies \ndecreased.10 Retail tariffs increased from AZN0.017 per kWh to AZN0.060 per kWh in January \n2007. \n \n68. \nIt  is  projected  that  there  will  be  a  gradual  improvement  in  the  company\u2019s  financial \nperformance  and  position  during  the  planning  period  from  2008  to  2015.  Estimated  financial \nresults  are  considerably  improved  over  that  period.  Net  profit  after  taxation  is  forecast  to \nincrease from AZN130 million in 2008 to AZN657 million in 2015. \n \n69. \n2015 because of a growth in production and demand, and the increase in tariffs. \n \n\nRevenues  are  forecast  to  increase  from  AZN1.06  billion  in  2008  to  AZN2.34  billion  in \n\n                                                 \n10  Subsidies for 2007 were zero; those subsidies in the 2007 statements were incurred the previous year. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nThe  increase  in  sales  and  general  improvement  in  performance  is  mainly  due  to \n70. \nAzerenergy  and  the  Government\u2019s  new  attitude  toward  electricity  tariffs  covering Azerenergy\u2019s \ncosts.  The  financial  projections  assume  that  tariffs  will  increase  at  the  same  rate  as  gross \nelectricity production but will also be adjusted from time to time to meet the covenants set forth \nby  the  ADB  loan.  The  base  case  therefore  assumes  a  30%  increase  by  2012.  As  the \nGovernment  increased  retail  tariffs  by  more  than  three  times  in  2007,  such  increase  can  be \nconcluded as reasonable. \n \nImprovement  in  each  of  the  key  performance  indicators  during  2008\u20132015  reflect  the \n71. \npositive  changes  forecast  in  the  financial  statements.  Total  equity  is  forecast  to  increase  from \nAZN1.03 billion in 2008 to AZN5.05 billion in 2020, and AZN13.73 billion by 2030. \n \nBecause  of  careful  forecast  of  cash  disbursement,  the  repayment  of  current  trade \n72. \npayables  will  be  only  40%  in  the  year  of  purchase  in  2008,  60%  in  2012,  and  70%  in  2015, \nreaching 90% in 2020 and afterwards. It is assumed that such cash disbursement policy will be \navailable  because  of  the  Government\u2019s  full  control  over  the  oil  and  gas  companies  (biggest \nsuppliers to Azerenergy). This policy enables the company to keep a positive balance of cash at \nthe end of each year during the forecast period. Projected increases in electricity sales and the \ngradual  improvement  in  cash  collections  will  lead  to  a  substantial  increase  in  cash  in \nsubsequent  years.  A  positive  cash  flow  will  allow  the  company  to  fulfill  its  commitments \n(including  the  previously  mentioned  outstanding  debts)  and  to  carry  out  self-financing  of \nrequired capital investments. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Management Structure \n\n \n73. \nThe  financial  management  structure  of  Azerenergy  was  assessed  and  found  to  be \nadequate. A financial management assessment was undertaken to ensure the current ability of \nAzerenergy  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  under  the  proposed  loan.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire was completed by Azerenergy to facilitate a review of \nits  financial  systems  and  processes,  and  to  identify  any  issues  or  constraints.  Azerenergy\u2019s \nmanagement assessment is in Appendix 12. \n \nAzerenergy  currently  maintains  its  accounting  and  reporting  procedures  in  accordance \n74. \nwith  Azerbaijan\u2019s  Accounting  Regulations.  However,  significant  steps  have  been  taken  for  the \nadoption  of  IFRS.  Azerenergy  prepared  a  draft  new  accounting  policy  and  new  chart  of \naccounts  to  meet  IFRS  requirements.  Preparatory  work  for  the  reconciliation  of  all  expositing \naccounts  to  the  new  accounts  is  currently  being  carried  out.  The  management  of  Azerenergy \nassumes  that  the  new  accounting  policies  and  procedures  will  be  adopted  in  the  company \nduring  the  year.  However,  there  are  significant  obstacles  in  disseminating  the  new  policies \namong  the  accounting  staff  of  the  company\u2019s  subsidiaries.  The  level  of  qualification  of  the \naccountants is varied in different regions of the country.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nD. \n \n75. \nThe  Project  has  no  major  environmental  impacts.  A  minor  impact  on  nature  is  that  of \nwhite  storks  (ciconia  ciconia),  which  have  built  nests  on  transmission  towers  near  the \nTurianchay Reserve. It is recommended that the Project avoid these during the breeding season \nand  then  move  the  nests  to  the  newly  constructed  towers  or  specially  built  nesting  towers. \nSpecial  handling  will  be  required  with  respect  to  toxic  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs)  in \ntransformer  oil.  This  includes  one  old  transformer  containing  PCBs,  which  will  be  removed  for \nuse elsewhere. The Project will require an assurance from Azerenergy that the new transformer \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nSocial Safeguards \n\nwill  be  filled  with  a  nontoxic  substitute  for  PCB.  Azerbaijan  does  not  have  specific  laws  or \nregulations on handling of PCBs but is a signatory to the Stockholm Convention, thus the terms \nof the convention and United Nations guidelines detailing safe handling and prevention of PCB \nemissions are to be followed.  \n \n76. \nProject  implementation  will  require  environmental  monitoring  as  detailed  in  the \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  to  avoid  standard  construction \nimpacts.  These  include  environmental  standard  operating  procedures  such  as  cleaning  up \nconstruction  sites,  proper  disposal  of  spoils,  grading  damaged  land  and  replanting  vegetation, \nprotecting  the  public  from  excessive  noise  and  dust  during  construction,  etc.  With  respect  to \nhandling  PCBs,  Azerenergy  will  need  to  coordinate  with  the  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Natural \nResources  (MENR)  as  the  government  agency  responsible  for  handling  hazardous  materials \nand  to  engage  the  services  of  the  specialized  hazardous  materials  company  established  by \nMENR. \n \nE. \n \n77. \nResettlement. The new 280 km transmission line will pass inside the corridor of the old \nlines,  with  the  new  towers  sited  in  principle  on  the  same  bases  of  the  old  ones.  As  the  line \ncorridor is already formally owned by Azerenergy, no land acquisition will be needed. Based on \nexisting agreements, no land compensation will be given to farmers that may be affected by the \nfew  towers  that  may  require  new  bases  following  detailed  design. 11  By  regulation,  the \ntransmission line may require the removal of a few houses already existing within the corridor \nand  may  cause  temporary  impacts  to  crops  (wheat)  cultivated  under  various  transmission  line \nsections  for  a  total  of  some  130  km. 12 To  avoid  these  impacts  as  required  by  the  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Azerenergy has agreed to (i) allow the permanence of \nexisting  houses  under  the  lines;  (ii)  schedule  construction  in  farmed  areas  during  the \nnonagricultural  season  (from  June  to  September);  and  (iii)  reflect  these  provisions  in  the  civil \nworks  contracts.  Based  on  this,  the  Project  is  classified  category  C  and  no  resettlement  plan \nwas prepared. However, to guarantee that the transmission line construction plan and schedule \nneeded to avoid impacts is adopted, Azerenergy has prepared a detailed due diligence report \nproviding  all  needed  qualitative  and  quantitative  background  on  potential  project  impacts, \ndetailing all provisions needed to avoid them, and indicating the result of a consultation process \ncarried out among selected communities farming land under the lines. To cover all possibilities, \nthe  due  diligence  report  also  details  the  project  implementation  conditions  and  the  action \nneeded  to  satisfy  ADB  policy  requirements  on  compensation  if  the  adopted  impact  avoidance \nmeasures cannot be implemented because of force majeure. \n \n78. \nIndigenous  Peoples.  The areas crossed by the transmission lines are all occupied by \ncommunities belonging to the Azeri national majority. This Project will thus not trigger the ADB \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998);  it  will  be  classified  category  C  and  will  not  require  the \npreparation  of  an  indigenous  peoples  development  plan.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n11  Based on existing agreements, Azerenergy allows local farmers to cultivate land under the line but retains the right \n\nto reclaim the right to use the corridor if needed. \n\n \n\n12  The remaining length of the line passes over desert, steppe, or grassland areas where no impact to livelihood will \n\noccur. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nF. \n \n79. \nThe Project was designed based on the following key assumptions: (i) macroeconomic \ngrowth  remains  stable,  (ii)  the  Government  remains  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and \ndevelopment,  (iii)  the  Government  is  commitment  to  establishing  cost-recovering  tariffs,  (iv) \nAzerenergy is committed to implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures in \na  timely  manner,  (v)  project  and  financial  management  of  Azerenergy  is  sound,  and  (vi) \ncounterpart financing is adequate. \n \n80. \nRisks to the Project include (i) an unexpected increase in prices of commodities and raw \nmaterials,  (ii)  a  delay  in  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  caused  by  government \napprovals,  and  (iii)  delays  in  implementation  of  social  and  environmental  mitigation  measures. \nThe  Project  is  fully  supported  by  the  Government,  and  the  cabinet  of  ministers  will  coordinate \nthe  work  of  government  agencies  to  ensure  that  any  issues  are  resolved  promptly.  Adequate \nconsulting  services  are  provided  to  help  Azerenergy  manage  implementation,  monitor \nperformance, and report to ADB. Price contingency funds are included to respond to unforeseen \ncost  changes.  Azerenergy  is  also  committed  to  implement  the  social  and  environmental \nmitigation  measures  fully,  and  relevant  provisions  will  be  incorporated  in  the  civil  works \ncontracts. \n \nThe  project  financial  risk  is  low.  There  is  clear  evidence  that  the  Government  has  had \n81. \nconsiderable  success  in  the  transition  to  full  cost  recovery  for  the  power  utility  by  2010.  The \nGovernment  also  confirmed  that  no  subsidies  will  be  given  to  Azerenergy  from  2008.  Tariff \nreform  has  significantly  supported  the  target  of  achieving  a  financially  self-sustainable  power \nsector. The proposed Project, together with efforts from other development partners, will have a \nsynergized  effect  on  enhancing  Azerenergy\u2019s  financial  performance  and  will  assist  the \nGovernment to achieve its committed reform agenda.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and Azerenergy have given the \n\nCounterpart  Support.  Azerenergy  will  make  available  the  funds,  facilities,  services, \n\n82. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n83. \nland, and other resources, as required, for timely implementation and operation of the Project.  \n \n84. \n \n\nFinancial Management:  \n\n(i) \n\nAzerenergy  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the  Government\u2019s  \nannouncement on the implementation of tariff policy reform, and it will implement \nthe  tariff  policy  in  accordance  with  its  terms  and  defined  timetable,  which  will \nenable  Azerenergy  to  achieve  its  full  cost  recovery  of  its  operations  by  31 \nDecember 2010.  \n\n(ii)  Within 6 months following the end of each financial year, Azerenergy will submit \nto  ADB  (a)  the  IFRS  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  company  and  its \nsubsidiaries,  audited  by  an  international  auditing  firm  acceptable  to  ADB,  and \n(b) audited financial statements in respect of the Project.  \n\n(iii)  Within  3  months  of  the  end  of  each  financial  year,  Azerenergy  will  compute  its \ndebt  service  coverage  ratio  and  gearing  ratio  for  each  such  financial  year,  and \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nsubmit these to ADB; and from the year 2012 onwards, Azerenergy will maintain \nthe debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5, and the gearing ratio of not \nmore than 70%.  \n\n \nEnvironment.  Azerenergy will ensure that (i) the Project is designed, constructed, and \n85. \noperated in accordance with Azerbaijan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy  (2002)  and  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE);  (ii)  any  adverse  environmental \nimpacts are minimized by undertaking the mitigating measures detailed in the EMMP as set out \nin the IEE; (iii) implementation of the EMMP and any violation of environmental standards are \nreported semiannually to ADB; (iv) the EMMP is incorporated in bidding documents and bills of \nquantities  of  the  civil  work  contracts;  (v)  the  EMMP  is  updated  after  detailed  design  and  due \ndiligence,  with  prior  approval  of  ADB;  and  (vi)  all  environmental  permits,  licenses,  and \nclearances are obtained in a timely manner prior to commencement of civil works in the relevant \nsection of the Project. \n \n86. \nAzerenergy will ensure that the handling of transformers and PCBs adheres to the terms \nof the Stockholm Convention, of which the Government is a signatory, and with United Nations \nprocedures  for  safe  handling  of  PCBs.  Azerenergy  will  ensure  that  the  new  transformers  are \nfilled with a nontoxic substitute for PCB. Azerenergy will coordinate the handling of transformers \nand PCBs with MENR as the agency responsible for hazardous materials. \n \n87. \nResettlement.  Azerenergy  will  ensure  that  (i)  the  Project  does  not  require  any  land \nacquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement;  (ii)  the  new  transmission  lines  and  towers  follow  the \nexisting  alignment  and  locations,  respectively;  (iii)  before  commencement  of  civil  works,  a \ndetailed due diligence report is completed on potential social impacts and submitted to ADB for \napproval;  (iv)  in  the  event  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  becomes  necessary,  or  any \npotential impact on indigenous peoples is identified, a suitable resettlement plan is drawn up in \nconsultation with the affected people, and approval of ADB, in accordance with the applicable \nlaws  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples,  and  is  implemented  in  accordance  with  its  terms;  (v)  the  existing  houses \nunder the transmission lines remain intact during project implementation; (vi) the construction is \nscheduled  in  the  farm  areas  only  during  the  nonagricultural  season  (June  to  September);  and \n(vii) these provisions are incorporated suitably in the bidding documents and made part of the \ncivil works contracts. \n \n88.   Change  of  Ownership  and  Operation.  In  the  event  a  change  is  proposed  (i)  in  the \nownership or control of the Project, Azerenergy will, at least 6 months prior to implementation of \nsuch  a  proposal,  consult  with  ADB  and  obtain  its  consent;  and  (ii)  in  the  ownership  of \nAzerenergy,  the  Government  will  consult  with  ADB  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  affect  the \nimplementation of the Project or the terms of the loan agreement. \n \n89. \nGovernment.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (i)  it  remains  committed  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  State  Program  on  the  Development  of  the  Fuel  and  Energy  Sector  in \nAzerbaijan (2005\u20132015); (ii) it fully implements its medium-term tariff policy, which incorporates \ntransition to full cost recovery for utility service providers by 2010; (iii) the distribution companies \nare required to make timely payments for 100% of the power received from Azerenergy; (iv) it \nprovides  financial  support,  as  and  when  needed,  to  Azerenergy  to  enable  it  to  fulfill  its \nobligations under the loan agreement with ADB; (v) it causes Azerenergy to make available all \ncounterpart funding and facilities; and (vi) its cabinet of ministers coordinates the work between \nthe  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  MENR,  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Energy,  Ministry  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19 August 2008 \n\nFinance, and other government ministries/agencies for expeditious resolution of any issues, and \ntimely implementation of the Project. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n90. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$160,000,000  to  Azerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company,  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of \nAzerbaijan,  for  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the \ndraft Loan and Guarantee Agreements presented to the Board. \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\n \nImpact \nImproved power \ntransmission system \nthat provides reliable \nand adequate \nelectricity for \nsustained economic \ngrowth \n\nOutcome \nThe capacity of the \nbackbone 220 kV \npower transmission \nand distribution \nnetwork is expanded \nand strengthened, \nwith transmission \nbottlenecks removed \nand losses reduced \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnual electricity supply in \nthe project area increased \nby 1,000 GWh by 2012  \n \nAnnual average electricity \noutrages reduced by \n40 times, from 8\u201310 times \nper year to 0.2 times per \nyear by 2012 \n \nTransmission system \noperating and maintained \nin accordance with \ntechnical requirements by \n2012 \n\nOptimization of power \ngeneration resource use \nthrough increase of \ndomestic hydropower \nproduction by 200 GWh \nand reduction of \nimportation energy by 650 \nGWh by 2012  \n\nAnnual net CO2 emission \nreduced by 1.3 million tons \n\n  \nTransmission bottlenecks \nremoved by 2012 \n \nPower transmission \ncapacity of the 220 kV grid \nincreased by 300 MW in \n2012 \n \nDistribution capacity of \n220 kV substations \nincreased by 650 MVA by \n2012  \n \nReduction of transmission \nline losses by 25 GWh, \nfrom 6% in 2007 to 3% in \n2012   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAnnual national \nstatistics report \n \nStatistics regularly \nconducted by \nAzerenergy \n \nProject quarterly \nprogress reports \n\nADB project completion \nreports \n\n \nAssumptions \nMacroeconomic growth \nremains stable \n\nGovernment remains \ncommitted to power \nsector reforms and \ndevelopment \n\n \n\n \n\nPlanned transmission \nand generation projects \ncommissioned \n \n  \n\n \nNational economic and \nsocial statistics \n \nAzerenergy annual \nreport, financial \nstatement, and project \naccount \n \nProject quarterly \nprogress reports \n \nADB review missions \n \n\n \nAssumptions  \nGovernment\u2019s high \npriority accorded to the \nProject \n \nLoad growth and \nsystem expansion as \nforecast \n \nImproved institutional \ncapacity \n \nAdequate \nmaintenance of \nfacilities \n \nRisk \nDelay in project \nimplementation \n \n\n\f22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nAssumptions \nand Risks \n\n \n\n \n\nAzerenergy annual \nreport, financial \nstatement, and project \naccount \n \nProject quarterly \nprogress reports \n \nADB review missions \n \n\nOutputs \n1.

Overview  \n\nPOWER SECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nAzerbaijan  is  rich  in  diverse  and  abundant  energy  resources.  The  overall  volume  of  the \n1. \ncountry\u2019s  hydrocarbon  reserves  is  estimated  at  4  billion  tons  of  oil  equivalent.  Oil  and  natural \ngas reserves are 1.8 trillion cubic meters. Along with oil and gas reserves, Azerbaijan has 200 \nmillion  tons  of  natural  bitumen  reserves,  350  million  tons  of  shale  oil  reserves,  and  25  million \ntons of projected reserves of lignite. Oil production dominates in the country\u2019s economy; about \n50 million tons of oil is produced annually.  \n \n2. \nBy  early  2007,  Azerbaijan  was  importing  about  5  billion  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas \nannually from the Russian Federation. This gas was used exclusively for electricity generation \nto  reduce  inefficient  heavy  oil  consumption.  Currently,  domestic  gas  production  is  increasing \nbecause of incrementing gas production by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic and \nthe  development  of  Shah  Deniz  field  (whose  reserves  are  estimated  at  over  1 trillion  cubic \nmeters). The weight of natural gas consumption in electricity generation is therefore increasing. \nThe  country  also  improves  gas  supply  and  district  heating.  In  addition,  Azerbaijan  has \nsubstantial  potential  in  the  development  of  alternative  and  renewable  energy  sources  mainly, \nfrom small hydropower and wind power.   \n \nB. \n \n3. \nPower  Generation.  Thermal  power  generation  accounted  for  89%  of  total  electricity \ngeneration  in  2007  (78.9%  from  natural  gas  and  21.1%  from  heavy  oil),  while  hydropower \ngeneration  accounted  for  11%.  The  overall  installed  capacity  of  all  generation  plants  in \nAzerbaijan  as  of  1  March  2008  was  5,508  megawatts  (MW).

The  electricity  production  of  Azerbaijan  in  2007  was \n21,415 gigawatt-hours (GWh), of which 19,053 GWh (89% of total) was generated from thermal \npower  and 2,363  GWh (11%  of  total)  from  hydropower.  In 2007,  about  360  GWh of  electricity \nenergy  was  imported  from  abroad.  The  imported  energy  was  primarily  from  Iran  to  supply \nNakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic,  which  does  not  have  direct  access  to  the  national  power \nnetwork,  and  also  from  the  Russian  Federation,  with  which  Azerbaijan  maintains  an  annual \nbalance  of  import  and  export.  The  total  export  electricity  energy  to  Iran  and  the  Russian \nFederation  was  727  GWh.  Total  domestic  electricity  consumption  in  2007  was  19,000  GWh. \nThe  growth  rate  of  domestic  electricity  demand  reached  5.8%  in  2007  and  4.4%  in  2006. \nHowever,  countrywide  electricity  consumption  decreased  by  13%  in  2007  compared  to  2006 \nbecause  of  extensive  installation  of  accurate  meters  and  a  tariff  increase.  It  is  forecast  that \nelectricity  demand  will  grow  by  an  average  of  about  4.7%  per  year  through  2015.

Government Policies and Strategies for the Power Sector \n \n8. \nSector  Reforms  and  Policies.  With  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nand  other  development  partners,  a  comprehensive  energy  sector  (including  power,  renewable \nenergy,  gas,  and  heat  supply)  road  map 1  was  prepared  in  2006.  The  Government\u2019s  main \nobjectives for development of the power sector are to utilize energy resources efficiently, protect \nthe  country\u2019s  energy  security,  and  ensure  the  delivery  of  reliable  and  adequate  electricity \nservices  for  sustained economic  growth.  Since  2005,  the Government  has  been  implementing \nreforms  in  the  utilities  and  infrastructure  sectors,  through  financial  restructuring  of  the  large \n\n                                                 \n1   Valiyev, Vilayat. 2006.

Manila: ADB . \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nnatural  monopolies,  separation  of  commercial  and  regulatory  functions,  and  introduction  of  a \nproper  regulatory  framework.  The  Government\u2019s  overall  policy  framework  for  development  of \nthe  power  sector  has  the  following  components:  (i)  sector  restructuring  to  separate  the \nownership and management of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) development of a \nregulatory framework and institutions to promote competition and ensure the financial viability of \nsector enterprises; (iii) introduction of targeted social protection programs to mitigate the impact \nof higher tariffs on vulnerable groups; (iv) involvement of the private sector in the operation and \nfinancing  of  generation  and  distribution  facilities;  and  (v) promotion  of  the  use  of  renewable \nenergy  sources  and  energy  efficiency.  Progress  on  sector  restructuring  has  been  achieved, \nincluding the establishment of four regional distribution companies; private sector operations in \nthe  power  generation;  and  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  who  is \nresponsible for  energy  sector  policy making,  pricing  and  tariffs,  licensing,  and  management  of \nfixed  assets.  The  Tariff  Council,  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  has  the \nauthority  to  propose  tariff  adjustments,  define  customer  categories,  and  adopt  cost-reflective \ntariff  design.  Furthermore,  the  Government  ordered  all  large  companies  to  change  to \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards  (IFRS)  by  January  2008,  and  all  government \nministries  have  to  implement  international  public  reporting  standards by  January  2009.  This  is \nunder the management and control of the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n9. \nDevelopment  Strategies. The Government\u2019s power sector development strategies are \ndefined  by  the  state  program  for  the  development  of  fuel  and  energy  complex  of  Azerbaijan \n(2005\u20132015),2 which was approved by presidential decree on 14 February 2005. The outlines of \nthe strategies include \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nconstruction of new combined cycle gas turbine generation units and hydropower \ngeneration capacities; \n\nmodernization  and  reconstruction  of  operating  power  units\u2014increasing  their \nefficiency, prolonging their useful life, and expanding available capacities; \n\ndevelopment  of  small  hydropower  and  other  renewable  energy  sources  (wind \nand solar) to supplement the energy balance; \n\nconstruction  of  new  substations  and  transmission  lines  to  expand  transmission \nand  distribution  networks,  and  reconstruction  and  upgrade  of  dispatch  control \nsystems; \n\nstrengthening of cross-border links with the Russian and Iranian grids to increase \npower trade capacity; \n\nincreasing  investments  for  energy  sector  development  and  attracting  foreign \ninvestments; \n\nexpanding  international  collaboration  and  participating  in  the  formation  of \nregional energy markets; and \n\n(viii) \n\npromotion of private sector participation in infrastructure development. \n\n \n10. \nrelating to the power sector, are currently in force:  \n\nExisting Legislative Framework.

This  covers  policy  objectives,  ownership  of  resources, \ncontrol of exploration, development of fields, and construction and maintenance \nof  energy  systems.  It  includes  a  strong  commitment  to  energy  efficiency  and \ncontains significant licensing provisions.   \n \nLaw  on  Power  Engineering  (1998).  This  provides  the  legal  basis  for  power \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  purchase,  sales,  and  consumption.  It \ngoverns  the  activities  of  state  power  engineering  companies,  power  supply \ncompanies,  independent  power  producers,  and  consumers.  The  relevant  state \nauthorities  are  responsible  for  licensing,  transmission  and  distribution  contracts, \npricing, de-monopolization, performance criteria, rules, and standards.    \n \nLaw  on  Electric  and  Thermal  Electric  Plants (1999). This creates convenient \nconditions  for  the  production  of  electricity  and  heat  in  power  plants,  including \ndevelopment  of  independent  power  producers;  construction  and  operation  of \npower  plants  with  sovereign  guarantee;  and  implementation  of  environmental \nmonitoring and management for power plants. \n \nLaw  on  Use  of  Energy  Resources  (1999).  This  provides  the  legal,  economic, \nsocial, and environmental grounds for utilization of energy resources. \n \nLaw  on  Natural  Monopolies  (1998).  This  defines  the  institutional  and  legal \nbasis of state regulation of natural monopolies, and ensures the conformity of the \nactivities of natural monopoly with consumers\u2019 interests. \n \nLaw on Privatization of State Property (2000). According to the law, the major \nobjective  of  privatization  of  state  property  is  to  achieve  improvement  in  the \nefficiency  of  the  economy,  structural  adjustments,  and  living  standards  of  the \nstrengthening  of \npopulation \nentrepreneurship, \nformation  of  a  competition  climate,  and  attraction  of \ninvestments. \n\nliberalization  of \n\nthe  economy, \n\nthrough \n\n \nInstitutional  Structure.  The  cabinet  of  ministers  mainly  provides  the  normative  and \n11. \nlegislative basis for the sector, while the Ministry of Industry and Energy carries out state policy \nin the energy sector (development and application of strategies, investment plans, development \nprograms, normative and legal documents, etc.) and conducts regulatory (issuance of licenses, \ndevelopment and application of standards, preparation of various codes, etc.) and supervisory \nfunctions  (technical  audits,  monitoring,  reporting,  information  requests,  etc.)  for  sector \nenterprises.  As  regulatory  bodies,  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  implement  the  regulatory  functions,  such  as  formation  of  the  economic  and  financial \npolicy in the sector; and overseeing investment plans, tariff issues, subsidies, and financial and \nsocial  assistance.  The  Tariff  (Price)  Council  addresses  monopoly  services  for  the  electricity, \nnatural  gas,  and  water  sectors.  It  has  authority  to  propose  tariff  adjustments  to  the  cabinet  of \nministers, define customer categories, and adopt a cost-reflective tariff design. The committee \nfor management of state property has the supervisory function over the concession agreements \nfor  electric  distribution  networks  and  approves  their  investment  programs.  It  also  supervises \nrelations  with  consumers,  and  oversees  any  privatization  and  management  of  property  in  the \nenergy sector.  \n \n12. \nAzerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (JSC)  is  the  state-owned  power  company  that \ngenerates  electricity,  transmits  the  generated  electricity,  and  delivers  part  of  it  directly  to \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nconsumers  and  sells it  in  bulk  to  power  distribution  companies.  Distribution  companies  deliver \nelectricity  to  retail  consumers  within  their  service  areas.  Small  private  hydropower  plants \n(independent  power  producers)  generate  electricity  and  deliver  it  directly  to  power  system  or \nconsumers.  \n \n13.  Private  Sector  Participation.  Under  the  laws  governing  the  power  sector,  the  sector\u2019s \ninstitutional  structure  comprises  interrelations  among  Azerenergy,  power  supply  enterprises, \nindependent power producers, and power consumers. Azerenergy is dominant in the generation \nand  transmission  of  electricity,  as  well  as  about  50%  of  electric  distribution  networks. \nIndependent  power  producers  have  emerged  as  a  result  of  the  privatization  of  three  small \nhydropower plants. They operate within the structure of other enterprises and sell the generated \npower  independently.  In  September  2007,  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  the \nKorean Power Company signed a preliminary agreement on the construction of the first private \nthermal power plant (700 MW).   \n \n14.  Price\u2013Tariff Policy. The price and tariff regulation is conducted by the reorganized Tariff \nCouncil.  In  compliance  with  existing  legislation,  decisions  on  the  regulation  of  prices  (tariffs), \nservice fees, and collections are adopted by a simple majority of vote principle. The regulations \nalso provide the principles and methodology for state regulation.  \n \n15.  Current  wholesale  and  retail  electricity  tariffs  were  approved  by  the  Tariff  Council  on \n6 January  2007.  The  wholesale  tariff  is  AZN0.041  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  inclusive  of  value-\nadded  tax  (VAT)  for  Azerenergy  Open  JSC,  AZN0.025  per  kWh  for  small  private  hydropower \nplants,  and  AZN0.045  per  kWh  (VAT-inclusive)  for  wind  power  plants.  Retail  tariffs  for  all \nconsumer categories (residential, commercial, and others) is AZN0.06 per kWh (VAT-inclusive). \nThe  transmission  tariff  is  AZN0.002  per  kWh  (VAT-inclusive).  Prices  for  export  and  import \ntransactions  are  regulated  under  the  terms  of  relevant  agreements.  Electricity  import\u2013export \narrangements are conducted with the neighboring Georgia, Iran, and Russian Federation. The \nmajority  of  import\u2013export  arrangements  with  the  Russian  Federation  are  on  a  monetary  basis \n(prices  are  subject  to  negotiations  between  two  countries).  There  is  a  severe  difference  in \nexport and import transactions because Azerbaijan imports Russian electricity mainly for peak \ndemand  periods  at  higher  tariffs,  and  exports  electricity  to  the  Russian  Federation  at  lower \ntariffs during nighttime. The electricity swap with Iran is conducted on a seasonal basis\u2014this is \nefficient  because  Azerbaijan  imports  electricity  from  Iran  in  the  winter  (when  Azerbaijan  has \npeak  electricity  demand)  and  exports  to  Iran  in  the  spring  and  summer  (when  Iran  has  peak \nelectricity demand). \n \nD. \n \n17. \nThe power sector has suffered from inadequate funding to invest in new power facilities, \nperform essential maintenance functions, and introduce new technology. The most challenging \ntechnical problems of the power sector are (i) deterioration of 20% of the power equipment and \nmore than 50% of the grid facilities; (ii) a shortfall of peak load in the system (about 300 MW); \nand  (iii)  lack  of  adequate  capacity  of  transmission  lines.  The  high-voltage  transmission  lines, \nincluding  those  connecting  Mingechevir  and  Absheron,  are  obsolete  with  high  losses  and \nfrequent outages. Some of these transmission lines have completed their useful life. The result \nhas  been  a  distinct  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  the  infrastructure  and  an  associated \ndeterioration \nthe  quality  of  services.  Rehabilitating  and  upgrading  generation  and \ntransmission  facilities  could  significantly  improve  the  reliability  and  quality  of  power  system \noperation, and reduce system losses. The proposed Power Transmission Enhancement Project \nwill substantially contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts in that respect. \n\nExisting Problems and Challenges in the Power Sector  \n\nin

This  will  include  (i)  preparing  an  implementation \nschedule  for  mitigation  measures,  based  on  the  Project\u2019s  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE); (ii) establish an environmental monitoring and reporting plan; \nand (iii) provide training for relevant government officers in the implementation of \ndetailed environmental management plans. \n\nPrepare  and  submit  an \ninception  report  and  quarterly  progress  reports \nacceptable  to  ADB,  and  compile  a  project  completion  report  in  the  format \nprescribed  by  ADB  providing  details  of  project  implementation,  problems \nencountered,  solutions  adopted,  and  detailing  and  explaining  any  variation  in \nproject costs and implementation times from the original estimates. \n\n(xiii)  The  consultant  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  completed \nproject by comparing a number of indicators prior to and after completion of the \nnew transmission lines. The impact of the Project on Azerenergy\u2019s operations will \nbe monitored by evaluating data on electrical losses, sales loss through system \nbreakdown,  average  cost  of  service,  and  monthly  consumption  by  consumer \ncategory.  The  impact  of  the  bulk  supply  distribution  system  will  also  be \nevaluated. \n\nReporting Requirements \n\n \nC. \n \n4. \nBesides  the  design  report,  the  consultants  will  provide  a  brief  inception  report  within \n4 weeks  from  the  start  of  the  assignment,  a  quarterly  progress  report  within  15  days  from  the \nend of each quarter, and a project completion report at the end of the assignment. Three copies \nof these reports will be provided to Azerenergy, and three to ADB (two to Manila and one to the \nAzerbaijan Resident Mission). \n \nD.  \n \n5. \n A  total  of  90  person-months  of  international  consulting,  to  be  associated  with  about \n100 person-months  of  local  expertise,  will  be  spread  over  4  years,  from  the  fourth  quarter  of \n2008 to the end of 2011. \n \n\nPerson-Month Estimates \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n39\n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nBackground  \n\nThe proposed Project, to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is set in the \n1. \ncontext  of  the  state  program  for  development  of  fuel  and  energy  sector  in  Azerbaijan  (2005\u2013\n2015). 1  The  state  program  recognizes  the  changing  structure  of  energy  demand,  with  the \nsignificant  increase  in  the  residential  component,  and  the  consequential  impact  on  peak \ndemand in the winter caused by the heating load. \n \n2. \nAlthough Azerenergy identifies benefits to the replacement transmission lines, within the \ncontext  of  the  state  program  for  energy  transmission,  neither  Azerenergy  nor  the  Government \nhave undertaken any cost\u2013benefit analysis to support these benefits other than in the following \nreferences. It was however concluded by Azerenergy and confirmed by ADB that the Project will \nincrease the supply of the power network by 300 megawatts (MW), reduce the capacity loss by \n8 MW, and cut the loss of electric energy by 25 gigawatt-hours (GWh).  \n \n3. \nAzerenergy also identifies the shortfall in peak capacity (some 300 MW), which requires \nthat  peak  demand  is  met  by  importing  energy  from  the  Russian  Federation.  It  is  on  this  basis \nthat  the  justification  of  the  replacement  transmission  lines  is  proposed,  by  evaluating  the \navoidable cost of imported peak power. \n \n4. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) compares the annual streams of economic \ncapital and operating costs against benefits based on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and \nrevenues are expressed in 2007 constant prices. The analysis period includes the construction \nperiod and 23 years (up to 2030) of operation. Details of the assumptions and calculations used \nfor  the  economic  analysis  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  The  economic  analysis  confirms \nthat the Project will alleviate high energy costs for the country, and help meet energy security \nand projected growth in demand for electric power. Cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and \nanalyzed, and they indicated that the Project is economically viable. \n \nB. \n\nProject Alternatives \n\nWhen replacing existing transmission lines, consideration of the least-cost option will be \n\n5. \nIf connections between existing centers of demand and generation need to be sustained, \nthere are no viable alternatives to replacing existing transmission lines. There may be options \nregarding routing, connections to the lines, and the location of substations, and these should be \nsubject to evaluation by system planning techniques.    \n \n6. \na matter of evaluating the technical specifications. \n \n7. \nAzerenergy  has  addressed  the  issue  of  the  project  alternative  from  a  different \nperspective. Its prefeasibility study report projects that the new transmission lines will result in \nthe availability of an additional 300 MW of capacity (which represents the design capacity of a \ngeneric thermal power plant).    \n \n8. \nThe  cost  of  the  proposed  transmission  lines  (capital  cost  of  $176  million)  has  been \ncompared  with  the  construction  cost  of  a  generic  power  plant  ($460  million).  In  addition,  the \n\n                                                 \n1  Cabinet of Ministers. 2005, State Program for Development of Fuel and Energy Sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u20132015). \n\nBaku. \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nlifetime  operational  cost  of  the  transmission  lines  is  calculated  to  be  some  $16  million  a  year \ncheaper.  While  the  comparison  may  serve  to  emphasize  the  merit  of  the  replacement \ntransmission  lines,  the  alternative  of  constructing  a  new  generating  plant  has  not  been \nproposed.   \n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis Calculations \n\n \n\n1. \n\nCost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n\n2. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n9. \nThe EIRR calculation was based on incremental cost and benefit streams associated to \nthe  Project.  Economic  performance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios.  Incremental  consumption  occurs  because  of  the  extended  availability  of  lower-cost \nelectricity. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the Project.  \n \n \n \nReduced Imports. The methodology applied for evaluating the single quantified benefit \n10. \nof  the  Project  was  the  avoidable  cost  of  importing  peak  energy  from  the  Russian  Federation. \nThe value of 650 GWh for the saved import energy is based on actual data. \n \nThe  basis  for  valuing  the  replacement  transmission  line  is  that  it  will  permit  the  direct \n11. \nsubstitution of imported electricity with own generation. The economic benefit is therefore non-\nincremental, and relates to a traded product. The basis of valuation will be the tariffs relating to \nthe import and export of electricity. Azerenergy indicates that, in terms of trading energy with the \nRussian  Federation,  it  is  only  able  to  export  at  the  low-rate  night  tariff  of  2.3  cents  per  kWh \n(c/kWh) (which does not cover generation cost). \n \n12. \nThe  economic  price  should  therefore  be  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  the  import \nand export prices, and it is assumed that these contractual prices have no element of transport, \ndistribution,  or  handling.  This  approach  follows  ADB\u2019s  guidance  on  import  substitute  and \nexportable  output.2 The  base  case  has  assumed  the  weighting  of  imports  to  exports  at  50:50, \nbased on the assumption of 650 GWh\u2014this is considered conservative given that, aside from \n2007, imports have exceeded exports by more than two times.3 This gives a weighted average \nprice  for  import  to  export  exchange  of  4.25  c/kWh.  A  detailed  explanation  can  be  found  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \nis \n13. \nincorporated  into  the  calculation  of  the  total  650  GWh  energy  increase.  There  is  an  implied \nassumption  of  4%  system  losses,  which  appears  reasonable.  Table  A9.1  shows  the  recent \nlevels of transmission losses. \n\nTransmission  System  Losses.

Manila (Appendix 10).  \n3  Azerenergy regards 2007 an exceptional year because of reduced consumer demand resulting from the 2007 retail \ntariff increase of 170% in combination with the increased installation of electricity meters. Import and exports were \nestimated at about 250 GWh for a total of 500 GWh for 2007. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41\n\nA reduction of 12.5% in transmission losses (the midpoint in the anticipated 10%\u201315% \n\nReduced  Maintenance  Costs.  An annual reduction in maintenance costs of $100,000 \n\n14. \nrange of improvement) will reduce the absolute level to 4% (para.13). \n \n15. \nImproved  System  Performance.  Based  on  2006\u20132007  fault  statistics,  it  is  estimated \nthat  total  annual  outages  amounted  to  33  hours  for  Mingechevir  1  transmission  line  and  33.5 \nhours for Mingechevir 2 transmission line. \n \n16. \nTo derive a value for power lost from an annual average outage of 33 hours, reference \nwas made to the World Bank report on the Azerbaijan Power Transmission Project.4 The report \nshows  losses  for  Mingechevir  1  and  2  transmission  lines  in  2003  totaling  224.5  hours  with \nlosses  of  13,605  megawatt-hours  (MWh);  by  interpolation,  the  average  annual  2006\u20132007 \nlosses equate to 2,000 MWh.  \n \n17. \nThe  World  Bank  report  also  identifies  willingness  to  pay  on  the  basis  of  a  weighted \naverage  cost  of  diesel  and  kerosene  of  21.5  c/kWh.  Adjusting  this  value  from  2005  to  2007 \nprices  by  taking  the  movement  in  the  AZN/$  exchange  rate  gives  a  value  of  24.3  c/kWh  for \nwillingness  to  pay.  If  it  is  assumed  that  the  new  line  will  reduce  outages  by  50%,  the  annual \neconomic  benefit  is  1,000  MWh  valued  at  willingness  to  pay,  giving  a  total  of  $243,000  per \nannum. \n \n18. \nhas been identified by Azerenergy for inclusion in the economic analysis. \n \n19. \nDeferred  Expenditure  on  New  Generation.  Azerenergy  identifies  the  cost  of \nconstructing a 300 MW power station at $460 million as an alternative option to the replacement \ntransmission  lines.  Investment  in  the  new  lines  will  defer  any  decision  to  increase  capacity  in \ngeneration,  and  the  related  benefit  will  be  the  capital  costs  savings  of  such  a  deferral\u2014as \nmeasured by the potential interest earned on the deferred debt service costs. This benefit has \nbeen  quantified  at  $3.0 million  per  annum,  assuming  a  10%  deposit  rate,  and  has  been \nassumed for the first 2 years of the Project. \n \n20. \nSalvage Value from Removal of Existing Lines. The removal of the existing lines will \ngive  rise  to  two  streams  of  benefits:  (i)  scrap  value  of  metal  content  of  equipment,  and \n(ii) opportunity benefit of reusing transmission towers at lower voltages. \n \n21. \nscrap metal. \n \n22. \nThe number of transmission towers to be reused is estimated at 600. The cost estimates \nfor  the  new  replacement  lines  include  980  new  towers,  so  a  recycling  rate  of  60%  seems \nreasonable. The cost of a new 220 kilovolt (kV) steel tower from the estimates is $64,400; it is \nassumed that the replacement cost of a smaller 110 kV tower is 50% of this value. \n \n23. \nThe  benefit  of  reusing  600  towers  at  lower  voltage  levels  is  therefore  $19.3  million. \nHowever, to reflect the potential uncertainties in these figures, a lower value of $10.0 million has \nbeen taken as a one-off benefit in year 5. \n \n\nAzerenergy  does  not  have  readily  available  data  to  quantify  the  potential  volume  of \n\n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2005.

The economic price of the construction costs will be the financial \ncosts  less  any  transfer  payments.  Therefore,  customs  duties,  value-added  tax,  and  payroll \ndeductions  have  been  removed.  With  regard  to  payroll  deductions,  assumptions  have  been \nmade regarding the labor component of project costs.  \n \n25. \nLand Costs. The replacement transmission lines will follow the route of the existing twin \nlines,  so  the  existing  land  usage  will  continue.  This  can  be  considered  a  sunk  cost,  with  no \neconomic  cost  consequences  for  the  Project.  However,  in  principle,  half  of  the  land  under  the \nexisting  transmission  line  will  become  \u201csurplus\u201d  and  can  be  considered  to  have  a  potential \nopportunity cost for the Project. Because Azerenergy owns the land, it has been suggested that \nany  surplus  could  be  utilized  as  compensation  to  the  local  population  for  the  disruption  of \nbuilding  the  new  lines.  Therefore,  the  release  of  land  would  transfer  an  economic  benefit, \ndependent on the use made of the land. No evaluation has been made of this benefit. \n \nOperating Costs. The only incremental operating cost is the 30 staff required to operate \n26. \nthe new substation; transfer payments relating to payroll deductions have been eliminated. It is \nunderstood  that  the  intention  would  be  to  initially  operate  the  substation  with  existing \nAzerenergy staff, but that over time local staff would be trained to operate the facility. \n\nE. \n\nResults \n\n  \n\n27. \nThe economic cost\u2013benefit analysis results in an EIRR of 14.8% for the Project. The net \nbenefits of the Project were estimated to be $26.14 million. The sensitivity analyses show that \nthe investment program remains justified even if various risks materialize.  \n \n28. \n \n\nThe economic classification of the benefits and costs is summarized in Table A9.2: \n\nTable A9.2: Structure of Transmission Project Benefits and Costs \n($ million) \n\nItem \nCapital Costs \nOperating Costs \n\nLabor \n\nProject Benefits \n\nReduced energy imports \nReduced maintenance costs \nReduced system outages \nReuse of transmission towers \nDeferral of generation expenditure \n\nPresent Value \n(142.34) \n \n0.29 \n \n154.67 \n0.56 \n1.36 \n7.12 \n5.07 \n26.14 \n\nTotal \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \n \nThe significant elements are the capital costs and the benefits attributed to the reduced \n29. \nlevel of energy imports, and recycling the transmission towers.

This is not a sustainable situation since the tariff would not cover generation costs, so it is \nanticipated  that  any  sustainable  increased  level  of  exports  would  be  at  a  higher  price.  The \nProject  therefore  delivers  a  robust  and  sustainable  economic  return  at  14.8%,  around  which \nindividual  sensitivities  do  not  indicate  any  significant  stress.  One  element  that  has  not  been \ncaptured in this analysis is the future potential for transfer of energy from east to west, and the \nstrategic  opportunities  that  could  be  developed  in  the  context  of  a  regional  power  exchange. \nSince  there  is  still  no  framework  or  data  on  which  to  evaluate  this  scenario,  it  remains  an \nunquantified but potential benefit. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45\n\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \n1. \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects 1 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  at  constant  2007  price  levels.  \nCost  streams  used  for  the  purposes  of  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  determination \n(i.e., capital  investment,  and  operations  and  maintenance)  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the \nestimated  benefits.  The  tariff  for  electricity  has  been  assumed  as  the  difference  between  the \ncosts of  imported  electricity  and  the  cost of  own  generation  of  electricity,  and  has been  set  at \n$0.036362 per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  The  tariff  is  applied  to the  volume  of  650  GWh\u2014assuming \nthat the Project will enable domestic generation to replace imports. \n \nB. \n\nMethodology and Major Assumptions \n\nThe financial viability of the Project has been assessed assuming a 3-year construction \n2. \nperiod from 2009 to 2011. It is assumed that construction will finish in the first half of 2011 and \nthe  new  line  will  start  to  operate  in  the  second  half  of  2011.  The  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital (WACC) is also calculated for the Project and was compared with the FIRR to ascertain \nthe  financial  viability  of  the  investment  program.  Price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction were excluded from the capital costs for the purpose of the FIRR, which is at 2009 \nconstant prices. The net present value (NPV) of the projected incremental net cash flows arising \nfrom the Project was calculated using the WACC as the discount rate, and was used to predict \nwhether the Project will generate sufficient funds to cover all project-related costs, including loan \ninterest and principal repayment. \n \n3. \nFinancial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of \nwith- and without-investment scenarios. The main incremental benefit assumed was due to the \ndecreased import of electricity, estimated at 650 gigawatt-hours (GWh), and consistent over the \nperiod  of  review  from  2011  to  2030  (half  year  benefit  in  2011).  No  incremental  additional \nmaintenance  costs  were  considered  compared  to  the  existing  transmission  lines.  After \nconsultation  with  Azerenergy,  an  assumption  of  an  annual  incremental  benefit  of  $100,000  in \nmaintenance savings was added. As the useful life of the new transmission lines is expected to \nbe 40 years, the residual value of the transmission lines has not been included in the analysis. \n \nTariffs  are  governed  by  regulations  specific  to  the  electricity  industry  and  national \n4. \nmonopolies. Historically, such tariffs have been based on a \u201ccost-plus\u201d system, meaning cost of \nservice  plus  a  margin,  where  costs  are  determined  under  the  rules  and  regulations  on \naccounting and reporting of Azerbaijan. In practice, tariff decisions are significantly affected by \nsocial and political considerations. Current levels allow Azerenergy to pass though the full cost \nrecovery of the loan, depreciation, return on equity, operation and maintenance expenses, and \nworking capital expenses. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  The  generation  element  of  tariffs  has  been  announced  to  be  4.2  c/kWh.  The  cost  of  $0.03636  is  derived  from \nactual  costs  generated  divided  by  actual  generation  for  the  year.  As  tariffs  include  a  10%  markup,  the  cost \nassumption is consistent with actual generation tariffs charged. \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n\n5. \nTo  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \nAzerenergy\u2019s equity contribution financed through  retained earnings. The cost of Azerenergy\u2019s \nequity is assumed at the domestic long-term savings rate of 10%. The other assumptions are a \ndomestic inflation rate of 5%. As shown in Table A10.1, the WACC for the investment program \nduring the Project is 2.45%. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \n \n\n \nADB loan \nItem \n160,000.00 \nAmount of project ($\u2019000) \n67.00 \nWeighting \n3.01 \nNominal cost (for calculation) \n22.00 \nTax rate \n2.30 \nTax-adjusted nominal cost \n\u2014 \nInflation rate \n2.35 \nReal cost \n4.00 \nMinimum rate test (4%) \n2.70 \nWeighted component of WACC \n1.57 \nWACC in real cost \n\u2014 = not applicable, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Azerenergy estimates. \n\nFinancing Component \nAzerenergy \n79,745.00 \n33.00 \n10.00 \n22.00 \n7.80 \n5.00 \n2.67 \n4.00 \n1.30 \n0.89 \n\nTotal \n239,745.00 \n100.00 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n\u2014 \n \n4.00 \n2.45 \n\n6. \nThe FIRR is calculated at 11.89% for the Project. This rate compares favorably with the \nestimated WACC value of 2.45% or the minimum test rate of 4% set by ADB, substantiating the \nfinancial  viability  of  the  Project.  In  performing  a  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  of  the  projected \nvariables used in the base case, the consultants used the following scenarios:   \n\n10-year stream of expected benefit instead of 20 years, \n\nincrease the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) up to 10%, \n\nincrease in capital expenditure (CAPEX) of 10%, \n\ndecrease in benefits of 10%, \n\ndecrease in benefits up to get NPV to zero, and \n\nincrease in CAPEX to get NPV to zero. \n\n \n7. \nEach  of  the  alternative  scenarios  was  assessed  in  terms  of  the  projected  incremental \ndiscounted cash flows arising out of the capital project. Using the WACC rate established for the \nbase case, the NPV and FIRR were calculated. \n \n8. \nThe  net  cash  flow  was  calculated  using  the  general  approach  of  the  presentation  of  a \ncash  flow  statement,  i.e.,  loan  principal  receipts,  loan  repayments,  loan  interest,  and \ncommitment fees have been included in the calculation.

In the most \nnegative scenario (10-year benefit stream), the NPV is negative and the FIRR  (3.32%) is less \nthan  the  WACC  test  rate  of  4%  but  above  the  actual  projected  WACC  of  2.45%.  The  new \ntransmission lines are expected to have a useful life of 40 years, so the benefit stream will most \nprobably  be  more  than  10  years.  Therefore,  aside  from  the  most  negative  scenario  of  an \nexpected  benefit  stream  of  10  years  instead  of  20  years,  the  Project  is  financially  viable  and \nAzerenergy will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover the projected costs (including \nloan interest and principal repayment requirements).  \n \n12. \nThe  sensitivity  analysis  includes  two  more  scenarios  to  investigate  at  what  level  (i) the \nexpected benefits should be decreased, or (ii) the CAPEX should be increased\u2014to get the NPV \nto  zero.  The  calculations  show  that  the  NPV  will  be  zero  if  (i)  the  benefits  reduce  by  54%,  or \n(ii) the CAPEX increases more than two times. \n              \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF AZERENERGY \n\n1. \nThe summary financial statements of Azerenergy are in Tables A11.1\u2013A11.5. Figures for \n2006\u20132007 (local statements) and the audited international financial reporting standards (IFRS) \nfinancial  statements  for  2005  (with  comparative  data  for  2004)  prepared  by  Price  Waterhouse \nCoopers  were  reviewed.  Figures  for  2008\u20132030  are  projections,  based  on  notes  and \nassumptions described below. Detailed financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nA. \n\nPast Financial Performance \n\nin \n\ntotal \n\nrevenue \n\nAzerenergy  experienced  growth \n\n2. \nin  2007\u2014AZN934  million \n($1.146 billion),  a  222%  increase  over  2006\u2014despite  the  fact  that  energy  demand  did  not \nincrease  correspondingly.  The  main  reason  for  this  growth  was  the  increase  in  tariffs.  The \ncompany\u2019s  operating  results  also  improved  during  2007  because  of  the  overall  increase  in \ntariffs.  The  cost  of  sales  amounted  to  AZN695  million  ($853  million)  in  2007,  or  74%  of  total \nrevenue, a significant improvement over 2006 where it was 185% of total turnover. The cost of \nfuel continued to be the largest component of the cost of sales\u2014in 2005, it accounted for 73% \nof the total (74% in 2004). The cost of imported energy was AZN27 million ($32 million) in 2007, \nfalling from AZN38 million ($46 million) in 2006. The ratio of total equity and liabilities improved \nslightly from 22% in 2006 to 26% in 2007. The total liabilities to equity ratio also improved from \n3.45  in  2006  to  2.84  in  2007.  The  improvement  in  Azerenergy\u2019s  gearing  ratio  shows  that  the \ncompany  is  able  to  earn  enough  capital  using  long-term  borrowings  for  investment  in  the \nindustry.  In  spite  of  a  significant  improvement  in  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio  (up  to  0.50 \ntimes  in  2007  from  0.05  times  in  2006),  this  performance  indicator  is  still  low.  However,  from \n2007,  the  Government  has  been  making  efforts  to  increase  tariffs  to  cover  costs  plus  a  10% \nreturn.  In  2007,  tariffs  were  increased  to  a  point  where  government  subsidies  were  no  longer \nneeded. Detailed financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB. \n\nProjections \n\n \n\n1. \n\nInflation and Exchange Rate \n\n3. \nAn average annual inflation rate of 5% is projected during the entire forecast period. This \nis  similar  to  the  parameters  used  for  financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  Project.  All  data  was \nprepared in Azerbaijan manats (AZN), so the amounts of capital expenditures forecast in other \ncurrencies  have  been  exchanged  to  AZN  at  the  rate  of  AZN0.85  =  $1.00.  To  simplify  the \ncalculations, the same exchange rate was used for the whole forecast period, so exchange rate \ngain or loss was ignored. \n \n \n\nIncome Statement \n\n2. \n\n4. \nSales. Azerenergy provided the energy balance and demand forecast, based on actual \ndata for 2007. Although actual electricity production and demand decreased in 2007 compared \nto  2006,  Azerenergy  management  assures  that  this  is  a  temporary  decrease  caused  by  the \nsignificant  tariff  increase  and  the  introduction  of  a  metering  program  in  2007.  Therefore,  it  is \nassumed that gross electricity production will increase by 5% per year up to 2021, then by 3% \nper year up to 2025, and 2% thereafter. Imports of electricity will continue at 650 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh) per year until the transmission line is operational from the middle of 2010 (it is assumed \nthat 300 GWh will be imported in 2011). \n \nTariffs. In principle, tariffs increase with gross electricity production (5% per year up to \n5. \n2021,  3%  up  to  2025,  2%  thereafter)  but  they  are  also  adjusted  to  meet  the  covenants  of  at \nleast 1.5 times debt service coverage ratio (free cash flow over debt service for the year) and a \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\ndebt to liabilities and equity ratio of 70%. Therefore, there is a one-off increase of 30% in 2012. \nTariff levels are shown in Table A11.1. \n\n \nTable A11.1: Tariff Levels \n\n \n\n \n\nIndicator \nAZN/kWh \nIncrease (%) \nDSCR (times) \n\nActual \n\n2006 \n\n0.017 \n\n2007 \n0.048 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n170 \n \n\n2008 \n0.051 \n5 \n \n\n2009 \n0.053 \n5 \n \n\n2010 \n0.056 \n5 \n \n\nProjected \n2012 \n0.076 \n30 \n1.530 \n\n2011 \n0.059 \n5 \n \n\n2013 \n0.080 \n5 \n1.960 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n0.084 \n5 \n1.830 \n\n0.088 \n5 \n2.420 \n\nNote: Principle repayment starts in 2012 from where DSCR calculation starts. \nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nOperating  Expenses  and  Taxation.  The  cost  of  fuel,  staff,  and  other  operating  costs \n6. \nare  projected  on  the  basis  of  actual  2007  data,  adjusted  on  annual  growth  of  electricity \nproduction  which  is  assumed  at  an  average  growth  of  3%  per  year  from  2008  to  2020,  4% \nduring  2021,  and  5%  from  2025  onward.  Average  growth  in  expenses  is  less  than  the  total \naverage inflation rate (5%) in the early years because of the effect of implementation of various \ncost control measures including the introduction of a financial management information system \nwithin a separate institutional strengthening program. Taxes are assumed to be the same as for \n2007 (profit tax 22%, VAT 18%). \n \n\n3. \n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow \n\n7. \nFixed Assets Capital  Expenditures and Debt. Capital expenditures include proposed \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) project expenditures during 2009\u20132011; and other current and \nfuture  projects  financed  by  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD), \nWorld  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), and others. It is assumed that Azerenergy will increase its own contribution to financing \ncapital expenditures starting from 2016. Total capital expenditures will gradually decrease from \nAZN658 million in 2009 to AZN200 million in 2013. A significant increase in capital expenditures \nis  assumed  from  AZN350  million  in  2015  to  AZN1.70  billion  in  2030  due  to  the  expanding \nnetwork  and  growing  economy.  It  is  expected  that  with  the  willingness  of  increasing  tariffs  to \ncover all costs, Azerenergy will generate enough cash for capital investments after 2016 and will \nfinance  the  majority  of  capital  expenditures  itself.  It  was  assumed  that  a  significant  part  of \ncapital expenditures after 2020 will be spent on replacement of old and out-of-date plants and \nequipment. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n \n\nFigure

A general \nreview of existing policies and procedures is presented in the following subsections, followed by \nrecommendations for improvements to financial management and reporting practices. \n  \nB. \n \n2. \nMajor accounting transactions are recognized and recorded by Azerenergy following the \naccrual  basis  of  accounting  (e.g.,  the  accounting  of  revenue,  cost  of  sales,  and  the  resulting \nreceivables and payables). The adoption of the accrual basis of accounting is very important in \nthe  process  of  bringing  local  accounting  procedures  in  compliance  with  international  financial \nreporting standards (IFRS). However, some expenses (such as bank charges, interest expense, \ntax  expense,  and  some  other  expenses)  might  be  recognized  by  Azerenergy  only  when \nsupporting documents are received, but not when the expense is incurred as required under the \nIFRS. Other departures from IFRS are noted in the following paragraphs. \n \nProperty,  plant,  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation,  except \n3. \nfor  items  that  were  commissioned  before  1996.  Items  acquired  before  1996  are  carried  at  the \nstatutory  indexed  cost.  According  to  existing  accounting  rules  in  Azerbaijan,  fixed  assets  are \nthose that are used for a period of more than 1 year and from which the company derives an \neconomic  benefit  from  their  use.  Depreciation  of  property,  plant,  and  equipment  is  accrued \nmonthly using the reducing balance method, by rates prescribed in tax legislation. \n \n4. \nProperty, plant, and equipment have been revalued (indexed) twice, in 1993 and 1996, \nto take account of the effects of inflation during these years. The indices used were prescribed \nin  guidelines  issued  by  the  cabinet  of  ministers.  Inventories  are  recorded  at  cost.  The  cost  of \ninventory is determined on the weighted average basis. The cost of finished goods and work in \nprogress comprises raw material, direct labor, and other direct costs.  \n \n5. \nA  physical  inventory  of  fixed  assets  and  stocks  is  performed  each  year.  A  special \ncommission  (including  fixed  assets  and  materials  accountants)  is  established  to  conduct  the \nstocktaking  and  to  prepare  a  report  on  the  results  of  the  inventory.  A  comparison  of  the  fixed \nassets and stocks physical count and accounting data is presented in the commission\u2019s report. \nThis process is concerned only with the physical verification of the assets, not with their value. \n \n6. \nThe billing and cash collection system for generation and transmission is centralized and \ncontrolled  by  the  management  of  Azerenergy.  Distribution  entities  are  decentralized,  and \ngenerate their own profit and produce their own income statement.  \n \n7. \nTrade and other receivables are accounted on the accrual basis (in accordance with bills \nsent  to  customers).  Revenue  and  resulting  receivables,  in  accordance  with  the  statutory  local \nfinancial  statements,  contain  a  significant  element  of  irrecoverable  debts.  The  creation  of \nprovision  for  doubtful  and  bad  debts  is  prohibited  in  accordance  with  local  tax  legislation. \nAzerenergy has the right to write off to bad debts expense those receivables that have not been \ncollected during the past 3 years, but the amount of the write-offs is very limited and must be \nagreed with state authorities such as tax inspectors. The company does not attempt to discount \nthe  long-term  part  of  trade  receivables  that  was  deferred  in  accordance  with  government \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\ndecrees. The company does not separate the long-term part of receivables in the local balance \nsheet, but shows the total amount as current receivables. \n \n8. \nTrade and other payables are accrued when the counterparty performed its obligations \nunder the contract and are carried at cost. Accounts payables comprise trade accounts payable, \npayables to employees for salary and wages, tax payable, payable to non-budget social funds, \nand  payables  to  other  creditors.  The  company  does  not  discount  the  long-term  part  of  trade \npayables  and  deferred  tax  payables  in  accordance  with  government  decrees.  The  company \ndoes not separate the long-term part of payables in the local balance sheet but shows the total \namount as current payables.    \n \n9. \nThe  authorized  capital  of  Azerenergy  has  been  created  on  the  basis  of  certificates \nentitling  the  founder  to  the  assets  of  the  company.  The  sole  founder  of  the  company  is  the \nGovernment  of  Azerbaijan.  From  time  to  time,  the  authorized  capital  might  be  changed \n(adjusted)  in  accordance  with  changes  in  legislation  or  reregistration  of  the  company\u2019s  legal \nposition. No shares have been issued. \n \n10. \nStarting  in  2006,  profit  tax  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  22%  of  taxable  profit.  Prior  to \nthat,  the  profit  tax  rate  was  24%.  Profit  after  taxation  is  distributed  to  the  accumulation  and \nconsumption  (social)  funds.  These  funds  are  usually  used  for  the  reimbursement  of  expenses \nwhich,  in  accordance  with  local  tax  legislation,  are  not  allowed  to  be  included  in  the  income \nstatement  as  expenses.  Examples  include  bonuses,  additional  payments,  material  aids  to \nemployees, provision for cultural and welfare facilities, charity, and other expenses.   \n \nIn  summary,  the  local  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  followed  by \n11. \nAzerenergy and its subsidiaries in general are in line with the norms and regulations set out in \nlocal tax legislation.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \ninternal  audit  department.  However,  company \nmanagement has made the decision to create an internal audit function and preparatory work is \nunder  way.  It  is  assumed  that  the  internal  audit  department  will  include  specialists  in  energy, \nmarketing,  economics,  finance,  and  accounting.  The  objectives  of  the  new  function  should  be \nthe control over the operating, marketing, and financial management activities of the company; \nand  provision  of  recommendations  for  their  future  developments.  Nevertheless,  the  structure \nand job descriptions for the staff of the internal audit department have not yet been developed. \n \n13. \nThe  financial  statements  of  Azerenergy  have  been  audited  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards since 1998 because of lenders\u2019 requirements (European Bank \nIslamic  Development  Bank).  The \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development,  World  Bank, \ninternational  audit  of  Azerenergy\u2019s  2005  IFRS  financial  statements  were  completed  in  June \n2007. In mid-2007, the company decided to publicly tender the IFRS audit for 2006. As a result \nof the tender, Deloitte & Touche started the audit of the 2006 accounts in October 2007 and the \nwork has not yet finished. \n \nD. \n \nThe  level  of  computerization  of  accounting  functions  in  the  head  office  of  Azerenergy \n14. \nand its subsidiaries is varied and ranges from the manual processing of all transactions in some \nsubsidiaries to the implementation of a computerized system (\u201c1C\u201d accounting software). On the \n\nAzerenergy  does  not  have  an \n\nInternal and External Audit  \n\nInformation Systems  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nwhole,  automation  of  accounting  and  reporting  procedures  at  Azerenergy  is  \u201cin  its  infancy\u201d; \nsubstantial  investments  are  required  for  hardware,  software,  and  computer  literacy  training \nprograms.  \n \nAs a result, any consolidated or segment reporting is difficult. This has contributed to the \n15. \nnegative  audit  opinions  the  company  has  received  so  far.  Therefore,  implementation  of  an \nintegrated financial management information system (FMIS) is necessary for Azerenergy. Given \nthe  company\u2019s  size,  top  of  the  range  systems  would  be  required  (mid-range  systems  are \nnormally recommended for companies with up to 200 system users). Assistance is required with \nsystem specification, tendering, and implementation management. The company recognizes the \nneed for introduction of an integrated FMIS but the poor financial situation has not allowed such \ninvestment so far. \n \n16. \n\nAzerenergy already benefits from the following infrastructure: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nlocal area network in head office, \ncomputers in head office, \ndial-up connection links to most accounting units, and \nlimited computers in the accounting units. \n\nDivergence from IFRS \n\n \n17.  While  this  infrastructure  is  adequate  to  support  operation  of  a  modern  FMIS,  the \ncompany  will  continue  to  experience  problems  with  effective  financial  management  and  audit \nrequirements.  When  requirements  for  a  new  FMIS  are  defined,  they  should  take  into  account \nthe need for additional infrastructure to support system operation. \n \nE. \n \n18. \nA  review  of  local  accounting  procedures  and  statutory  financial  statements  and  their \ncomparison with the audited IFRS financial statements for 2005 prepared by Price Waterhouse \nCoopers  revealed  a  number  of  divergences  from  IFRS.  Several  adjustments  were  required  to \nrestate local financial statements in line with the requirements of IFRS.   \n \n19. \n\nThe major adjustments include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nEliminate  all  intercompany  balances  between  head  office  of  Azerenergy  and  its \nsubsidiaries  at  the  consolidation  level,  and  present  the  net  value  of  accounts \nreceivable and accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet. \nCalculate  and  reflect  in  the  accounts  provisions  for  bad  and  doubtful  debts  for \ntrade and other receivables. \nTrade and other accounts receivable and accounts payable should be carried at \namortized cost using the effective interest method. \nRecognize the long-term part of accounts receivable and accounts payable, and \npresent in an appropriate manner in the balance sheet. \nRecognize  the  current  part  of  long-term  borrowings,  and  present  in  an \nappropriate manner in the balance sheet. \nTransfer the net book value of low-value items in use from the balance sheet to \nthe income statement as expenses. \n\n \n20. \nFair  valuation  of  fixed  and  other  assets  is  always  a  difficult  issue  in  the  transition  of \naccounting  under  local  standards  and  regulations  to  those  required  under  IFRS.  While  fixed \nassets  in  the  initial  IFRS  balance  sheet  of  Azerenergy  may  be  brought  in  at  deemed  cost, \nprovided  that  previous  revaluations  were  based  on  approved  indices,  the  adoption  of  a \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59\n\nrevaluation measurement model under International Accounting Standards 16 requires periodic \nrevaluation  of  assets  in  accordance  with  professionally  appraised  market  or  replacement  cost \nvalues as well as ongoing verification of the accuracy of such valuations through the application \nof  tests  for  impairment.  Alternatively,  the  adoption  of  the  historical  cost  model  under \nInternational  Accounting  Standards  16  removes  entirely  the  scope  for  revaluation,  which \nappears to contradict the asset measurement policy maintained by Azerenergy to date: \n\nTransfer  to  retained  profits  appropriations  (balance  sheet)  from  profit  )income \nstatement)  that  have  been  made  to  the  accumulation,  consumption,  and  social \nfunds; and \n\nTransfer  current  expenses  recorded  in  the  fund  accounts  to  the  income \nstatement (e.g., staff costs, general and administrative costs, other costs). \n\n \n21. \nOccasionally,  minor  adjustments  are  necessary  to  the  local  financial  statements  as  a \nresult  of  human  error.  It  is  anticipated  that  local  accountants  will  themselves  correct  such \nclerical errors in future in response to possible auditors\u2019 or consultants\u2019 recommendations. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title:   Azerbaijan: Power Transmission Enhancement Project  \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nCentral and West Asia Department \nInfrastructure Division \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  The  country\u2019s  poverty  incidence  has  been  reduced  from  47%  in  2002  to  24%  in  2006.  This  is  partly  the  result  of \nconsistently  double-digit  gross  domestic  product  growth  from  2003  to  2007,  which  averaged  21.8%  per  year.  This  growth \nowes much to its expanding  oil industry and the rising oil  price in the  world market. The interim operational strategy,  which \nguided Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in the country since it became a member in 1999, identified development \noutside  the  oil  sector  as  one  area  of  ADB  operations  so  that  other  sectors  would  grow  as  well.  The  country  strategy  and \nprogram  (CSP)a considers  the  country\u2019s  development  needs  as  still  tremendous.  However,  the  2005  ADB  sector  review \nmission identified renewable energy and gas supply in regional towns as investment niches. The CSP nonetheless identified \ndeteriorating  physical  infrastructure  and  its  need  for  rehabilitation.  The  state  program  on  poverty  reduction  and  economic \ndevelopment (2003\u20132005),b which is currently being updated, identified power lines that have to be improved as one action to \nreduce poverty.     \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: GI \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe Project intends to increase the efficiency of power transmission from Mingechevir hydropower plant to Baku, the country\u2019s \nindustrial center. It is not a core poverty reduction project but is expected to address the interim operation strategy to develop \nthe non-oil sectors of the economy to attain more balanced and sustainable growth. One constraint of the improvement of the \ncountry\u2019s power sector is the aging facilities, including power lines. The Project will replace the 50-year old Mingechevir\u2013Xirlan \npower line. The greater efficiency in power transmission will contribute to the improvement of power quality and availability in \nBaku. The capital city harbored a quarter of the country\u2019s poor in 2002, and this may have not changed much at present.  \n \nThe  contribution  of  the  Project,  in  providing  more  reliable  and  stable  supply  of  electricity,  will  benefit  both  industrial  and \ndomestic  users.  It  can  enhance  the  employment  capacity  of  industrial  users  and  has  multiple  poverty  impacts  on  domestic \nusers. It is well established that electricity supply can encourage home businesses to flourish as lights extend available time, \nand access to information and communication improves. The quality of water service, health care, and schools improves; and \nbecomes more available as electricity-driven devices are put to use. The greater and  wider availability of public and private \nservices saves time that can be diverted to other activities and further improves production. Wider use of electricity for lighting \nand cooking can spare wood fuels, which reduces forest use and improves indoor air quality. Electricity also has an enabling \neffect  on  women.  It  enhances  their  income  generation  capacity,  physical  mobility,  ability  to  organize  work  based  on \nconvenience, knowledge on gender issues, and decision-making power.         \n \n2. Design Features. The Project is designed to avoid land acquisition and resettlement impacts. Land acquisition is avoided \nby using the existing corridor and situating new towers on the same sites as old ones. Resettlement impacts are avoided by \nscheduling the civil works during the 8-month fallow period, dismantling the old towers and installing the new ones piece by \npiece, and use of poles instead of towers in sites where houses are close by.    \n\n \n \n\n \n\nBaku. \n\nC.

The Project has no land acquisition and resettlement impacts. If some crops are affected during the civil works, the owner \nwill be compensated with an amount equivalent to 1 year\u2019s production.  \n \n2. The main beneficiaries of the Project are industries in Baku. The improvement of the quality and availability of power supply \nare bound to enhance their production and employment-generating capacity. \n \n3. The improvement of employment will benefit the urban poor.  \n \n4.  Domestic  users  will  also  benefit  from  the  improved  quality  and  availability  of  power  supply  by  encouraging  home \nbusiness\u2014extending time for work and recreation, and enhancing social services among others.  \n \n5.  The  improved  quality  and  availability  of  electricity  will  increase  women\u2019s  access  to  information  and  technology;  and \nincrease  their  income  generation  capacity,  physical  mobility,  ability  to  organize  work  based  on  convenience,  knowledge  on \ngender issues, and decision making power. \n \n6. No indigenous peoples groups will be affected.          \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThere were meetings with local officials and representatives of nongovernment organizations, youth groups, and media on \n11 and 12 April in Mingechevir and Agsu to inform them about the Project and draw out their concerns. About 18 persons \nattended each meeting. About six meetings were held with people cultivating under the existing lines to elicit their concerns \nover the Project and inform them of the design measures to be taken to avoid any adverse impacts. In these meetings, they \nwere also informed of the plan to compensate for any destroyed crops with an amount equivalent to 1 year\u2019s production. Their \nrecommendations to further avoid any potential impacts were also solicited.      \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n\u2588  Information sharing       \u2588  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nBecause of the minimal adverse social impact expected if any, a C&P plan was deemed unnecessary. \n \n\n Yes    \u2588 No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit women in various aspects. Like any other project that increases the quality and availability \nof power supply, it is expected to enhance their income-generation capacity, physical mobility, ability to organize work based \non convenience, knowledge on gender issues, and decision making power.         \n \n \n \n2.
