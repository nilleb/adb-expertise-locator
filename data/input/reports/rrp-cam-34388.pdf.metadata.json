Technical \nassistance  for  education  regulatory  reform  and  governance  for \ndecentralization in the amount of $500,000 is also proposed.  \n \nThe  purpose  of  ESDP  II  will  be  to  consolidate  current  initiatives \nand  extend  them  through  new  poverty-targeted  strategies  and \nbroader coverage, building on the achievements of the Education \nSector  Development  Program  (ESDP)  and  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS), \n2003\u20132005, and the Education Strategic Plan (ESP), 2004\u20132008. \nESDP  II  will  also  support  the  National  Education  for  All  Plan \n2003\u20132015  in  line  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs).  Cambodia\u2019s  NPRS  and  Second  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  highlight  education  development  as  central  to \npoverty reduction and socioeconomic development. \n \nThe  sector  development  program  (SDP)  follows  on  from  ESDP \nand \nthe  process  of  government,  nongovernment \norganization (NGO), donor and ADB coordination to a full sector-\nwide approach. The SDP is pro-poor and strongly targets gender \nparity, poverty reduction and ethnic minority participation. \n \nSector: Education (Basic Education) \nTheme: Inclusive Social Development (Human Development) \nTargeted Intervention:  Sectoral/Subsectoral (MDG 2, 3) \n \n\ntakes \n\nThe  overall  objective  of  ESDP  II  is  to  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction  in  Cambodia  by  improving  access  to  and  the  quality  of \nsecondary education and lifelong learning opportunities for out-of-\nschool youth. ESDP II will support the long-term goal of education \nreform in establishing a market-responsive education and training \nsystem that will enable an increased level of education attainment \nin  the  workforce  and  increased  household  income.  The  objective \nis  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  ESP  and  the  Education \nSector Support Program (ESSP) 2004\u20132008 through (i) improved \nresource  mobilization  and  allocation  for  the  education  sector, \n(ii) increased  access  to  education  and  training  opportunities, \ninternal  efficiency,  and \n(iii) improved  standards,  quality  and \nsustainability,  and \nfor \ncapacity  building \n(iv)  effective \ndecentralization in education services.  \n\n\fii\n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and \nActions \n\n \nCapacity Building \n\n \nThe Investment Project \n\n \nSocial and \nEnvironmental Measures \n\nthrough \n\nstrengthened \n\nThe  program  loan  will  support  policy  interventions  to  (i)  improve \nequity  in  access  to  education  and  training  services  through  pro-\npoor systemic and targeted interventions; (ii) improve quality and \ninternal  efficiency;  (iii)  enhance  capacity  for  greater  education \nfinancial  planning, \ndecentralization \nmanagement and audit systems, a more focused human resource \nplanning  system  and  more  efficient  staff  performance \nmanagement, deployment and reward systems; and (iv) increase \nresource  mobilization  linked  to  measures  that  ensure  resource \nallocation is pro-poor, equitable, and efficient.   \n \nESDP  II  will  provide  the  policy  and  strategic  framework  for \naddressing  capacity-building  concerns  in  a  number  of  areas, \nincluding  (i)  decentralization  of  the  management  of  education \nservices,  (ii)  upper  secondary  education  policy  analysis  and \nstrategic  planning,  (iii)  strategic  management  of  the  expanded \ncommunity-based  skills  training  program,  and  (iv)  strengthening \npolicy-led  education  governance  and  regulatory  reform.  The \noverall Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MOEYS) capacity \nbuilding strategy, with ADB support, will be coordinated with other \ndevelopment agencies. \n \nThe investment project of ESDP II will enhance equitable access \nand improve the quality of lower (grades 7\u20139) and upper (grades \n10\u201312)  secondary  education,  and  provide  demand-driven, \ncommunity-based  skills  training  opportunities  mainly  for  out-of- \nschool  youth,  in  underserved  areas,  through  (i)  expanding  lower \nsecondary  education  opportunities, \n(ii)  expanding  upper \n(iii)  expanding \nsecondary  education  opportunities,  and \ncommunity-based  skills  training  for  out-of-school  youth  in  poor \ncommunities. \n \nCambodia\u2019s MDGs target a 50% reduction in the number of poor \nand  gender  equity  by  2015.  The  ESDP  II  policy  reform  agenda \ntargets  the  poor  through  (i)  increased  participation  and  equity  in \naccess  to  education  of  the  poorest  families;  (ii)  reduced  cost \nburden  on  the  poor  for  education;  and  (iii)  occupational  skills  for \nincreased \nincome  among  out-of-school,  unemployed  and \nunderemployed  youth  across  the  poorest  40%  of  the  country\u2019s \n1,621  communes.  The  increase  in  equitable  access  to  education \nservices  is  focused  on  the  poor,  through  abolition  of  informal \npayments  for  primary  and  secondary  schooling,  scholarship \nsupport  for  the  rural  poor  (especially  girls),  facilities  in  unserved \nand  underserved  areas  (especially  rural,  remote  and  ethnic \nminority  areas),  skills  training  in  the  poorest  communes  and  the \nredeployment of teachers to underserved areas. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \nThe Program Loan \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement, \nDisbursement, and \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n \n \nIt is proposed that a loan of $20 million equivalent will be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  an  interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5% \nthereafter. \n \nThe loan will be utilized over a period of 3 years, from around the \nsecond quarter of 2005 to the end of 2007, and will be disbursed \nin  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of  $5  million  will  be  available \nfor  disbursement  when  the  loan  comes  into  effect.  The  second \ntranche of $7.5 million will be released within 12-15 months from \nthe  first  tranche  release,  and  the  third  tranche  of  $7.5  million \nwithin 12 months of the second tranche release, upon satisfactory \ncompliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. \n \nMOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  policy  measures.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  program  and \nproject  loan.  The  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  secretary  of \nstate, MOEYS, and comprises representatives from the Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance  (MEF),  MOLVT,  the  Ministry  of  Planning, \nthe  Council  for  Administrative  Reform  (within  the  Council  of \nMinisters),  the  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior,  the \nMinistry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development, \nthe Ministry of Urban and Land Management, and the Ministry of \nSocial Affairs and Youth Rehabilitation.  \n \nThe  program  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB \nmember  countries,  excluding  items  specified  in  a  list  of  ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources.  The  counterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  supplement  the  Government\u2019s \npro-poor  budget  and  will  be  targeted  at  protecting  service \nprovision  to  the  poor,  and  as  agreed  between  the  Government \nand ADB, protect allocation to the education sector.  \n \nThe  counterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram  loan  will  be  used  by  the  Government  in  order  of  priority \n(i)  to  finance  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the \npackage  of  education  policy  reforms  under  the  program,  (ii)  as \npart  of  the  contribution  of  the  Government  to  the  ADB-funded \neducation  projects,  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  contribution  of  the \nGovernment to ADB-funded projects in other social sectors. \n \n \n \n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nThe Project Loan \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nExecuting Agencies and \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement, \nDisbursement, and \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n\n \nTime Frame \n\n \nProject Beneficiaries \n\nfor \n\n \n \nIt is proposed that a loan of $25 million equivalent will be provided \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a \nmaturity of 32 years with a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter.  \n \nMOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  lower  and  upper \nsecondary  education  components  of  the  Project  and  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  its  overall  implementation.  MOLVT \nwill  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  community-based  skills \nits  overall \ntraining  component  and  will  be  responsible \nimplementation.  The  steering  committee  will  be  the  same  as  for \nthe program loan. \n \nAll  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nInternational and domestic consultants will be recruited according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \nAn  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished, \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.  The  accounting  records  and  system  will  be  managed \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Accounting \nManual  for  Cambodia.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE) \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to \nliquidate advances to the imprest account. \n \nThe Project will be implemented over a period of five years, with \ncompletion expected by 31 December 2009. \n \nThe share of projected total capital and recurrent spending in the \npoorest  40%  of  communes  will  rise  from  28%  to  36%  over  the \nnext  five  years.  Similarly,  the  projected  spending  on  girls  will \nincrease  from  42%  of  projected  total  spending  to  46%  by  2008. \nThe  medium-term  benefits  will  be  (i)  increased  participation  in \nbasic  education  for  the  poorest  40%  of  communes  for  an \nestimated 0.8 million students, (ii) increased participation in upper \nsecondary  education  for  0.2  million  students,  (iii)  enabling  an \nadditional  0.6  million  children  to  progress  annually  to  the  next \ngrade of school, and (iv) expanded skills training opportunities for \nover 270,000 youths and adults in the poorest 40% of communes \nover 5 years.  \n \nThe  longer-term  benefits  will  be  to  provide  more  accessible  and \nrelevant formal education to about 4.2 million school-age children \nand  to  put  in  place  cost-effective  and  accessible  skills  training \nprograms  for  an  estimated  3.3  million  underemployed  young \npeople  aged  between  12  to  21  years  who  will  be  potential \nbeneficiaries of the Project.   \n\n\fRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n  v\n\nLimited  leadership  and  ownership  of  the  policy  reform  process \nand  lack  of  consistency  in  policy  and  strategic  decision  making \npose potential risks. These will be mitigated in a number of ways: \n(i) the extensive ESP 2004\u20132008 policy dialogue process, (ii) the \nfollow-up  review  and  assessment  process  with  development \nagencies  and  NGOs  to  secure  broad  support  of  the  reform \nagenda,  (iii)  the  annual  ESSP  review  process  which  facilitates  a \nphased  and  sequenced  approach  to  policy  implementation,  and \nfrom  advisory  support  of  other \n(iv) provision  by  ADB  and \ndevelopment  agencies  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related \nlegislative and regulatory reforms. \n \nAn uncertain fiscal climate and unforeseen developments (e.g., SARS \nin 2003 or avian influenza in 2004) also pose potential risks that may \nundermine  the  predictability  of  Government  resources  available  for \neducation, especially the significant transitional costs associated with \nthe  policy  reforms.  This  potential  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  (i) \nextensive dialogue on medium-term resource availability for education, \n(ii) using the medium-term expenditure framework process as a basis \nfor identifying potential budget shortfalls and for mobilizing increased \nsector  budget  support,  (iii) extensive  sector  efficiency  measures  to \ncontain  expenditure  growth,  and  (iv)  strong  policy  linkage  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s broader public financial management reforms. \n \nThe  limited  capacity  of  MOEYS  and  MOLVT  to  manage  and \nimplement the revised policies and strategies is another potential \nrisk.  Implementation  of  the  Project  by  technical  personnel  based \non  a  policy  of  decentralization  to  provincial  and  district  levels  is \nessential  for  capacity  building.  An  associated  risk  for  both  the \nupper  secondary \ntechnical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) and skills training is the \npotential  that  they  may  not  be  sustainable.  These  potential  risks \nwill  be  mitigated  through  (i)  provision  of  extensive  advisory \nsupport  for  subsectoral  and  program  planning  and  management, \n(ii)  extensive  dialogue  on  upper  secondary,  and  TVET  and  skills \ntraining  financing  to  sustain  the  National  Training  Fund  training \nvoucher  program,  and  (iii)  technical  assistance  to  ensure  that  an \nappropriate legislative and regulatory framework is in place. \n \nIt is proposed that ESDP II be accompanied by an advisory TA in \nthe  amount  of  $500,000.  The  TA  is  designed  to  strengthen \nMOEYS\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  education  regulatory \nreform  and  governance  for  decentralization.  The  objectives  and \nscope  of  the  advisory  TA  are  to  enable:  (i)  preparation  of  new \neducation  law  and  key  regulations  related  to  improved  institution \nand  financial  governance;  (ii)  improved  transparency  in  use  of \nparental and private contributions to schools and other institutions, \nthrough new guidelines on accounting and management of these \ncontributions;  and  (iii)  improved  governance  of  schools  and \npostsecondary institutions, through the issuance of guidelines that \nset  out  powers  and  responsibilities  of  education  authorities, \nparents and community associations. \n\nfacilities  component  and \n\n\f\f \n\n1\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Second  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(ESDP II). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building in \nEducation Regulatory Reform and Governance, and, if the Board approves the proposed loans, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nincluding  a  greater \n\n2. \nThe  Government  of  Cambodia  has  demonstrated  continued  commitment  to  pro-poor \neducation  reform  over  the  past  decade,  supported  by  a  broad  and  coordinated  external \nassistance  program.  The  formulation  of  the  Education  Strategic  Plan  (ESP)  and  Education \nSector  Support  Program  (ESSP)  2001\u20132005  enabled  a  shift  from  reconstruction  to  more \nsustainable  policy-led  development, \nfocus  on  pro-poor  systemic \ninterventions,  especially  aimed  at  reducing  cost  barriers  to  education  access  and  quality.  The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance program for education has reflected this transition \nover the past decade.   \n \n3. \nThe Government and its partners recognize the need to accelerate poverty reduction as \nset  out  in  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  and  the  Second  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2001\u201305, including speeding up pro-poor education reforms.  In mid\u20132003, \nthe Government approved the National Education for All Plan 2003\u20132015, the goal of which is to \nprovide  universal  access  to  9  years  of  high-quality  basic  education  in  line  with  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDG). Cambodia\u2019s MDGs target the following for achievement by 2015: (i) \nreducing the number of poor by 50%; (ii) achieving the National Education for All Plan; and (iii) \nachieving  gender  equity.  Accordingly,  the  ESP  and  ESSP  are  being  reviewed  and  revised  to \nconsolidate and extend the range of reforms for the period 2004 to 2008. The revised education \nsector  policies  are  fully  consistent  with  the  Government's  new  Rectangular  Strategy1  which \nplaces  increased  secondary  and  postsecondary  education  and  training  opportunities  at  the \ncenter  of  development  priorities.  The  policy,  strategic  directions  and  targets  as  embodied  in \nESP 2004\u201308 are in supplementary Appendix A. \n \nA. \n\nSector  Description and Performance  \n\n4. \nThe high dependence of the workforce on low-productivity agriculture limits opportunities \nto escape from poverty and is a major constraint on poverty reduction. Currently, 35\u201340% of the \npopulation has expenditures below the poverty line, with 15\u201320% living in extreme poverty. The \npercentage  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line  is  lowest  in  Phnom  Penh  (10\u201315%)  and \nhighest in rural areas (40\u201345%). Around 80% of the poor live in the plains and Tonle Sap basin. \nPoverty is most severe in urban areas and the rural plateau and mountain zone, although these \nareas have relatively low incidence of poverty, indicating high levels of inequality. Almost 90% of \nthe  poor  are  rural.  Incidence  of  higher  levels  of  poverty  correlates  strongly  with  levels  of \nparticipation  in  education  and  training  and  geographical  variations  in  provision  of  basic \neducation  and  skills  training.  While  households  headed  by  women  are  not  significantly  poorer \nthan others, they are often more vulnerable. Women, who are the primary promoters of school \nattendance, are particularly vulnerable. They have less land and access to labor, and thus rely \n\n                                                 \n1   The Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency includes capacity building \nand human resource development as one of the four rectangles. The strategy was presented by the Prime Minister \nto the first cabinet meeting of the new government on 16 July 2004. \n\n\f2 \n\nmore  on  risky  coping  strategies,  such  as  selling  assets,  or  pulling  children  out  of  school  and \nsending them to work.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n5. \nCambodia\u2019s NPRS and Second Socio-Economic Development Plan highlight education \ndevelopment as central to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development. The revised ESP \ngoes  further  by  establishing  the  necessary  human  resources  and  infrastructure  for  sector \ndevelopment  in  the  face  of  key  constraints,  such  as  the  shallow  human  resource  base  from \nwhich to draw people to take on education sector tasks and the very limited training resources \nfor  the  large  number  of  unemployed  and  undereducated  youth.  These  constraints  have  to  be \nmet,  while  uncertainties  in  labor  demand  are  prevalent  as  Cambodia  adjusts  to  economic \ntrends, including those arising from its recent entry into the World Trade Organization.  \n \n6. \nDemographic  and  labor  force  trends  will  increase  demand  for  education  and  training. \nThe  labor  force  is  estimated  to  be  6.4  million,  or  49%  of  the  total  population.2  As  Cambodia\u2019s \npopulation  is  relatively  young,  with  more  than  half  the  population  under  20  years  of  age,  it  is \nprojected  that  150,000  to  175,000  people  will  join  the  labor  force  every  year.  High  levels  of \neconomic  growth  will  be  needed  to  translate  this  into  job  creation.  The  comparatively  low \neducation level of the workforce, with 75% having primary education or lower and less than 3% \nhaving upper secondary, diploma or graduate qualifications, is recognized as a major constraint \non Cambodia\u2019s economic competitiveness and labor productivity. An education sector analysis \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nProvision of education and training opportunities is a joint task of the general education \n7. \nsystem  and  the  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET)  system.  However, \namong youth 15 years and over, the reach of the general education system, and of the upper \nsecondary  schools  in  particular,  is  limited  because  the  great  majority  of  youth  drop  out  early. \nBased on school year 2002\u20132003 data, out of a cohort of 100 pupils entering grade 1, only 15 \nwill reach grade 12, of whom only 7 will pass the examination and be eligible to pursue higher \neducation.  This  puts  the  burden  primarily  on  the  TVET  system.  The  current  TVET  delivery \nsystem  has  limited  capacity,  as  it  is  largely  supply-driven,  located  mainly  in  urban  areas, \nfragmented, and in need of significant quality improvement.  \n \n8. \nThe  Government  recognizes  the  urgency  of  action  to  expand  education  and  training \nopportunities for the large and growing number of unemployed and underemployed young aged \n12\u201324  years.  The  related  development  challenges  include  (i)  increased  participation  of  the \npoorest families in both primary and secondary education; (ii) equitable access to good primary \nand  secondary  education;  (iii)  a  reduced  cost  burden  on  the  poor  for  education,  through  a \ncombination  of  new  poverty-focused  strategies and  a  strengthened  education  financing  policy; \nand  (iv)  public\u2013private  partnership  in  governance,  management  and  financing  of  education, \nespecially beyond the first 9 years of basic education. ESDP II will build on the achievements of \nthe first ESDP.3  ESDP II is compatible with the framework and supports the broad policy and \nstrategic  directions  of  ESP  and  the  revised  ESSP,  2004\u20132008.  This  process  will  ensure  that \n\n                                                 \n2   Labor force survey, 2001.  \n3   ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nKingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila  (Loan  1864/1865-CAM(SF).  The \nloans  were  approved  on  4  December  2001  for  $20 million  equivalent  in  support  of  a  policy  reform  program,  and \n$18 million in an investment project to provide facilities development, and support for planning, management, and \nmonitoring. The program (Loan 1864) is expected to be completed by December 2004, and the project (Loan 1865) \nby December 2006. \n\n\f3 \n\nESDP II  is  firmly  embedded  within  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The  ESDP  II  program \nframework is in Appendix 2. \n \n\n1. \n\nEducation Access  \n\nthrough \n\n9. \nSince 2001, equity in access to basic education has improved. Primary and secondary \nschool  enrollment  has  increased  by  30%,  with  greater  participation  by  children  from  poorest \nfamilies, girls and ethnic minorities. Repetition rates have fallen in the lower primary grades and \nmany  primary  and  lower  secondary  classrooms  have  been  built.  Yet  important  challenges \nremain, notably the need to (i) reduce cost barriers to basic education, alongside targeted cost-\nsharing  for  postbasic  education  services;  (ii)  reduce  repetition  and  dropout  rates  at  all  levels, \nespecially  in  grades  1\u20136;  (iii)  improve  private  and  community  participation  in  grades  10\u201312, \ntargeted  and  demand-led  recurrent  and  capital \nhigher  education  and  TVET, \ndevelopment  financing;  and  (iv)  targeted  development  of  education  facilities  focused  on \neliminating incomplete primary schools and expanding provision for grades 7\u201312 in underserved \nareas. The Government is also exploring ways to respond to the training needs of the estimated \n3.3 million out-of-school youth aged 12\u201321 years. \n \n10. \nBefore 1998, the TVET  and skills training provision was narrowly focused on providing \ncraft-level training for public sector workers and was not very responsive to a changing and fluid \nlabor market. Public TVET institutions were restricted to Phnom Penh, with little provincial level \nprovision.  The  strengthening  of  a  network  of  18  provincial  training  centers  (PTC)  and  a  more \ndemand-driven  National  Training  Fund  (NTF)  to  stimulate  private  and  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) providers provided the initial impetus for change. Since then, the TVET and \nskills training sector has been characterized by a diversity of public, private and NGO providers \nin TVET. Public TVET institutions enroll around 7,000 students per annum, and commercial and \nNGO providers around 4,000.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEducation Quality Improvement  \n\n11. \nOver the last 4 years, there has been a substantial growth in spending by Government, \ndevelopment  agencies  and  NGOs  on  quality  improvement,  particularly  on  basic  education \nsupplies,  recurrent  spending  on  instructional  materials,  operational  budgets  in  postsecondary \ninstitutions, including teacher training; school management training; reform of grade 9 and grade \n12 examination processes; and pilot testing of primary school standards. The priority will be to \nstrengthen  these  systems  at  upper  secondary,  TVET  and  skills  training  and  higher  education \nlevels.  \n \n12. \nBefore 2000, schools were heavily reliant on individual development agency projects to \nsupport their operational costs, including provision of basic supplies. In 2001/02 the Ministry of \nEducation, Youth and Sport (MOEYS) introduced nationwide operational budgets to all schools \nthrough  the  Government\u2019s  own  financial  management  systems.  During  2002/03,  MOEYS \nallocated a total of KR31.5 billion to primary and secondary schools for the procurement of basic \nsupplies and teaching materials and for carrying out improvements to the school environment. \nGrant allocation formulas are specifically designed to be pro-poor, through higher allocations to \nsmaller schools frequently located in the poorest communes.   \n \n\n3. \n\nEducation Service Efficiency  \n\n13. \nThe  Government  has  committed  to  continue  the  strategies  initiated  during  ESP  2001\u2013\n2005, while ensuring a greater focus on improvements in staff efficiency and performance and \n\n\f4 \n\ngreater  accountability  through  performance  monitoring.  The  main  strategies  are  (i)  improved \neducation  service  efficiency  and  performance,  (ii)  decentralized  school  and  institution \nmanagement,  (iii)  sustainable  curriculum  reform  and \ninstructional  materials  provision, \n(iv) decentralized teacher development, and (v) improved performance monitoring. Before 2000, \nhigh repetition rates in primary grades resulted in significant additional costs to the Government \nand  parents,  contributing  to  significant  student  dropout  rates  from  the  poorest  families  in  the \nhigher  primary  grades.  Since  2001,  MOEYS  has  moved  on  two  strategic  priorities:  (i)  to \nintroduce  cost-effective  remedial  programs  alongside  monitoring  of  primary  grade  standards, \nand  (ii)  phasing  out  of  incomplete  primary  schools  through  better  use  of  existing  staff  and \nfacilities and selective classroom expansion.  \n \n\n4. \n\nTeacher Education and Supply \n\n14. \nTeacher  education  enrollment  has  remained  roughly  constant  in  recent  years.  An \nincreasingly  important  issue  is  improving  the  matching  of  teacher  supply  and  demand  with \nproposed education sector expansion. Forward planning will take account of the projected fall in \noverall primary enrollment and expansion of secondary enrollment, requiring a reorientation of \nteacher  supply  and  demand  and  staff  deployment  strategies.  MOEYS  has  introduced  specific \nguidelines for the recruitment of teacher trainees from remote areas as a strategy for education \nservice improvement in remote schools.   \n \n15. \nThe  quality  of  the  teaching  service  continues  to  improve  gradually.  The  number  of \ntrained primary school teachers increased from about 42,000 in 1999/00 to 47,000 in 2002/03.  \nThe  number  of  trained  secondary  school  teachers  increased  from  17,800  to  22,700  over  the \nsame  period,  and  a  greater  share  now  has  upper  secondary  education  or  graduate \nqualifications.  Nevertheless,  a  significant  proportion  of  classroom  teachers  have  only  primary \nand  lower  secondary  education  qualifications,  and  these  are  disproportionally  concentrated  in \nunderserved,  rural  and  remote  schools.  MOEYS  continues  to  devote  increased  resources  to \npre- and in-service teacher training, alongside expanded management training opportunities for \nschool directors.   \n \n16. \nA  key  issue  is  the  need  to  provide  more  equitable  access  to  good  upper  secondary \n(grades 10\u201312) education to generate school graduates from all provinces who are qualified for \nhigher  education  studies.  There  are  significant  provincial  variations  in  pass  rates  of  grade  12 \nexaminations and this affects the longer-term supply of graduates (including school teachers). A \nstrategic  priority  is  to  ensure  a  sustained  supply  of  well-qualified  grade  12  students  in  each \nprovince  to  break  this  vicious  circle  of  reliance  on  four  or  five  provinces  to  supply  graduate \nteachers for secondary education. \n \n17. \nIncluded in the sector development program (SDP) policy reform agenda are (i) putting \nin  place  appropriate  regulatory  guidelines  that  will  result  in  increased  equity  and  efficiency  of \nteacher  development, \nthe  role  and \nresponsibilities  of  teacher  training  colleges  in  response  to  changing  primary  and  secondary \nteacher  supply  needs:  and  (ii)  adjusting  the  salary  and  nonsalary  shares  of  education \nexpenditure  through  graduated  improvements  in  performance-based  teacher  allowances.  One \nof  the  specific  assurances  in  the  loan  agreement  is  that  the  Government  will  ensure  an \nadequate  supply  of  appropriately  qualified  lower  and  upper  secondary  school  teachers  in \nselected  project  schools.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Basic  Education  Support  Program  will  support \nteacher development. \n \n\nformulation  of  operational  guidelines  on \n\nthrough \n\n\f5 \n\n5. \n\nTrends in Education Budget Allocations \n\n18. \nEducation  sector  expenditure  has  increased  significantly  since  1997.  In  that  year, \nrecurrent  expenditure  on  education  was  an  estimated  9\u201310%  of  the  national  budget. \nSubsequently, education\u2019s share has increased steadily, reaching 19.5% in 2003/04. Recurrent \nspending  volume  has  increased  more  than  threefold  over  the  same  period,  reaching \nKR368 billion (around $92 million) by 2003/04. The Government is now the main contributor to \neducation  financing,  providing  an  estimated  50%  (2.1%  of  gross  domestic  product  in  2004), \ncompared  with  an  estimated  21%  in  1997.  An  indicative  medium-term  expenditure  plan  and \nfinancing  strategy  for  the  period  2004\u20132008  is  in  supplementary  Appendix  B.  Parental \ncontributions,  both  formal  and  informal,  have  remained  high  at  an  estimated  30\u201335%  in \n2003/04,  although  the  abolition  of  the  start-of-the-year  contribution  for  basic  education  has \nreduced contributions at this level. The majority of operational spending has focused on quality \nimprovement (e.g., sustainable textbook financing, teacher training) and interventions designed \nto  improve  access  by  the  poor  (e.g.,  scholarships  for  poor  students  and  girls4).  MOEYS\u2019s \nrecurrent budget priorities and programs are in supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n19. \nFollowing  a  decline  in  the  late  1990s,  external  support  for  education  has  expanded \nsignificantly in recent years and is currently estimated at around $50 million a year. This is due \nto  an  improvement  in  the  definition  and  implementation  of  sector  priorities  and  programs, \nthrough the joint Government, development agencies and NGO ESP and ESSP process. A key \ncharacteristic  has  been  the  shift  in  development  agencies  support  from  individual  project \nactivities  and  related  expenditure  towards  a  more  policy-led  and  results-based  sector-wide \nfinancing  strategy.  Another  trend  over  the  past  five  years  has  been  increased  external \nassistance for basic education, especially for facilities and capacity building for decentralization. \nThere  has  been  limited  support  for  upper  secondary  education  expansion,  TVET  and  skills \ntraining  and  higher  education.  However,  these  sectors  are  becoming  a  growing  priority,  as \ndemand  from  expanded  basic  education  opportunities  creates  pressure  higher  up  the  system. \nThe  Government  and  MOEYS  recognize  the  critical  importance  of  financing  if  access  and \nquality  improvement  policies,  including  a  combination  of  pro-poor  systemic  and  targeted \ninterventions,  are  to  be  implemented.  MOEYS  capital  budget  priorities  and  programs  are  in \nsupplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategic Priorities \n\n20. \nThe  Government\u2019s  long-term  goal  is  to  assure  equitable  access  to  9  years  of  high- \nquality  basic  education  by  2015,  alongside  a  growing  and  well  regulated  public\u2013private \npartnership  in  upper  secondary  education,  TVET  and  skills  training.  The  next  phase  of \neducation  reform  set  out  in  the  revised  ESP,  2004\u20132008,  will  accelerate  implementation  of \nthese  policies  and  strategies.  Nevertheless,  the  broad  policy  and  strategic  directions  can  be \nderived in the current the National Education for All Plan, 2003\u20132015, which is in harmony with \nESP, 2004\u201308.  \n \n21. \nThe overarching policy priority for ESP, 2004\u20132008, is to introduce further systemic cost \nreductions  for  families through  the abolition  of  informal  payments  across  grades  1  to  9  and  to \nreduce repetition and dropout rates, which create additional burdens for parents. An associated \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.  Targeted  Assistance  for  Education  of  Poor  Girls  and  Poor  Children  in  Ethnic  Minority  Areas.  Manila \n(JFPR  9028-CAM).  The  mechanisms  and  indicators  for  monitoring  the  poverty  reduction  impact  of  the  program \ninclude (i) poverty and socioeconomic status; (ii) risk of dropping out of school; (iii) distance of home to school; and \n(iv) parental attitudes towards education.  \n\n\f6 \n\nfocused  only  on \n\nESP,  2001\u20132005, \n\nstrategy  will  be  to  introduce  systemic  and  performance-based  teacher  remuneration  reforms, \nextending  the  narrower  targeted  teacher  allowances  introduced  in  the  last  three  years.  These \nstrategies will be complemented by an expansion of facilities development programs in currently \nunderserved areas.  \n \n22. \nlimited  expansion  of  postbasic  education \nopportunities  by  enabling  incremental  growth  of  public\u2013private  partnerships.  ESP,  2004\u20132008, \naims to further stimulate demand-side interventions by promoting and enabling community and \nprivate  sector  involvement  in  upper  secondary  education,  skills  training,  higher  education  and \nearly  childhood  care  and  development.  A  key  target  group  for  these  interventions  will  be  the \ngrowing number of underskilled and underemployed youth who will be the long-term engine of \nCambodia\u2019s socioeconomic development. \n \n23. \nThe  Government  has  prioritized  some  cross-cutting  issues,  including  ensuring  that \nstrategies and programs bring benefits to females and ethnic minorities. In consultation with the \nNational AIDS Authority, MOEYS has prepared a policy and strategic framework for HIV/AIDS5 \neducation,  designed  to  enable  implementation  of  broader  access  and  quality  improvement \npolicies and the use of schooling to reduce vulnerability to HIV/AIDS for disadvantaged groups \n(an analysis of HIV/AIDS education issues and programming is in supplementary Appendix E). \nThe  revised  education  reform  plan  also  incorporates  strategic  measures  for  the  use  of \ninformation  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  in  education  to  improve  access  and  quality \nimprovement, including distance learning and curriculum enrichment. \n \n\n7. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\n24. \nExternal  assistance  is  increasingly  well  coordinated  through  the  joint  annual  ESSP \nreview  process,  conducted  by  the  Government,  MOEYS,  development  agencies,  and  NGOs.  \nThe ESP and ESSP frameworks are used by all partners as a basis for screening and selection \nof  external  assistance,  ensuring  optimum  complementarity.  Increasingly,  the  ESSP  review \nprocess is used to assess the impact of current external assistance, make adjustments to, and \nnegotiate the forward pipeline of support, and has been used as a vehicle for planning ESDP II \nand  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Basic  Education  Support  Program.  In  2002  and  2003,  through  the \nEducation  Sector  Working  Group  of  development  agencies  and  NGO  Education  Partnership, \nboth  groups  prepared  their  own  assessment  of  external  assistance  and  collated  financial \ninformation on programming prospects and disbursements.  \n \nExternal assistance for education has grown significantly in the past five years as mutual \n25. \nconfidence  among  the  Government  and  development  agencies  in  the  direction  and  impact  of \nreform has increased. Total external funding to the sector for the period 2002\u20132007 is estimated \nto be $282.5 million, with $44.5 million actually spent in 2002, $44.7 million estimated for 2003 \nand  $193.3  million  projected  for  2004\u201307.  Of  the  total  projected  financing  for  the  2002\u20132007 \nperiod,  42%  is  expected  to  come  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  Other  large  amounts  are \ncommitted  by  United  Nations  agencies,  in  particular  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF)  and  the  United  Nations  World  Food  Program,  the  European  Commission  and  the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Details of external assistance to the sector are \nin Appendix 3 and the development coordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n26. \nA  recent  trend  has  been  the  shift  in  external  assistance  towards  basic  education, \ncompared  with  the  late  1990s  when  much  education  aid  focused  on  support  for  TVET  and \n\n                                                 \n5  Human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immune deficiency syndrome \n\n\f7 \n\nhigher  education.  To  date,  external  assistance  for  upper  secondary  education  development, \nskills training for unemployed youth in rural  areas and higher education has been limited. The \nESSP review (2003) highlighted the need to finalize strategies and begin mobilizing resources in \nthese  underserved  subsectors,  while  still  ensuring  that  sufficient  resources  for  primary \neducation quality improvement and lower secondary access expansion were available. Another \ncharacteristic has been the growing diversity of means of support.  \n \n\n8. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy and Operations in the Sector  \n\n27. \nADB\u2019s  education  sector  strategy  is  to  enable  implementation  of  education  policy  in \nsupport of balanced development. In Cambodia, ADB will build upon the ESDP\u2019s major role in \nmobilizing  international  support  for  education.  ADB's  involvement  is  built  on  the  ESP,  which \ncovers  all  levels  of  schooling,  including  technical  education,  and  emphasizes  institutional \ncapacity  building,  policy  reforms  and  infrastructure  support.  Considerable  progress  has  been \nachieved  in  implementing  the  ESSP,  especially  in  expanding  primary  education  for  the  poor, \nincreased budgets for education; growing and strong partnerships in education, and significant \ncommunity mobilization and decentralization of education planning and management. \n \n28. \nIn  particular,  ESDP  II  gives  greater  emphasis  to  governance  and  regulatory  reform,  as \nhighlighted  in  the  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Cambodia.6  Greater  strategic \nlinkage  between  the  policy  framework  of  the  program  loan  and  the  investment  project  is  also \nreflected  in  ESDP  II.  The  ESDP  has  contributed  significantly  to  pro-poor  education  policy, \nmarked  by  the  40%  increase  in  primary  school  enrolment  in  the  poorest  300  communes  in \nCambodia. Enrollment has increased with the abolition of the start-of-year fees, resulting in the \nenrollment of an extra 500,000 children from the poorest families in primary schools. ADB has \ncontributed  to  service  decentralization  to  over  6,000  schools  and  183  district  offices,  thereby \nincreasing grassroots powers and responsibilities for education. A nationwide textbook program \nin  over  6,000  schools  has  resulted  in  better  opportunities  for  teaching  and  learning  for  over \n3 million students and 70,000 teachers.  \n \n29. \nIn  support  of  ESDP,  (i)  an  advisory  TA,  Performance  Management  in  the  Education \nSector,7  was  completed  in  January  2004;  (ii)  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)-\nfunded  Targeted  Assistance  for  Education  of  Poor  Girls  and  Poor  Children  in  Ethnic  Minority \nAreas,8  is  being  implemented;  and  (iii)  in  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs \n(MOWA),  Sustainable  Employment  Promotion  for  Poor  Women9  was  approved  in  December \n2002  to  promote  income-generating  activities  for  rural  women.  The  Basic  Skills  Project10  was \ncompleted  in  May  2002  and  the  Basic  Education  Textbook  Project11  was  completed  in  April \n2002.  A  proposed  JFPR  project12  is  designed  to  support  incomplete  primary  schools  at  the \nprimary school level. ADB is assessing the scope for providing complementary support through \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Cambodia.

Moreover,  since  2001,  extensive \nADB  technical  assistance  for  planning  and  management  of  the  annual  joint  MOEYS, \ndevelopment  agencies  and  NGOs  education  sector  performance  review  has  established \npartnerships  and  strengthened  the  role  of  the  education  sector  working  group  of  development \nagencies and the NGO education partnership. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\n31. \nThe  overall  objective  of  ESDP  II  is  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  Cambodia  by \nimproving  access  to  and  the  quality  of  basic  and  upper  secondary  education,  and  lifelong \nlearning  opportunities  for  out-of-school  youth.  ESDP  II  will  support  the  long-term  goal  of  the \neducation  reform  by  establishing  a  market-responsive  education  and  training  system  that  will \nenable  an  increased  level  of  education  attainment  in  the  workforce  and  increased  household \nincome.  The  objective  is  to  support  the  implementation  of  ESP  2004\u20132008  and  ESSP  2004\u2013\n2008  through  (i)  improved  resource  mobilization  and  allocations  for  the  education  sector; \nfor  currently \n(ii) increased  access \nunderserved  areas  and  disadvantaged  groups;  (iii)  improved  standards,  quality  and  internal \nefficiency,  and  consequent  sustainability  in  the  education  sector;  and  (iv)  effective  capacity \nbuilding  for  decentralization  in  education  services.  The  program  and  project  loan  will \ncomplement each other to enable progress towards achieving these key sectoral objectives.   \n \nB. \n\ntraining  opportunities,  especially \n\nImportant Features \n\nto  education  and \n\nThe four policy areas and the three investment project components cover a wide range \n32. \nof educational activities, which will make the SDP a challenge to implement. However, all parts \nreinforce  one  another  and  fall  under  the  Government\u2019s  own  action  plans.  Links  to  the  World \nBank  project  in  lower  secondary  schools,  European  Commission  budget  support  in  key  policy \nareas,  and  JICA  programs  supporting  science  education,  all  help  to  raise  the  support  level  of \ndevelopment  agencies  and  are  mutually  reinforcing.  The  accompanying  advisory  TA  and  an \ninnovative  JFPR  project  also  lend  capacity  building  support  to  the  ministry  by  targeting  rural \nareas that lack schools with complete grades 1\u20139. Overall, the SDP is pro-poor and prioritizes \nrural  areas,  females  and  minorities.  There  is  an  HIV/AIDS  component  as  well  as  extensive \ncoordination with development agencies. The SDP demonstrates how education is adapting to \nchanges in sector lending. \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n \n33. \nDespite impressive improvements in the education sector in the last decade, significant \npoverty-related  constraints  remain,  including  lack  of  facilities  in  the  poorest,  most  remote  and \nunderserved districts and communes; incomplete primary schools; and insufficient resources to \nexpand  programs  with  poverty-targeted  incentives.  ESDP  and  JFPR  programs  are  having \nsignificant impact on these issues and have contributed to improvements. The purpose of ESDP \n\n\f9 \n\nII will be to consolidate current initiatives and extend them using new poverty-targeted strategies \nand broader coverage, consistent with the Government\u2019s NPRS, 2003\u20132005. Further support is \nneeded  for  the  ongoing  annual  education  poverty  impact  analysis,  designed  to  assess  the \ninfluence  of  the  reform  program  on  poor  families,  girls,  ethnic  minorities  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups. Operational research is needed to assess the impact at the household \nlevel, including changes in education expectations, decision making and priorities, especially for \npost-basic  education  opportunities.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 5. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n34. \nImprovements  to  existing  schools  under  the  Project  will  not  require  any  new  land. \nConstruction  of  new  schools  will  be  carried  out  only  on  vacant  and  idle  land  owned  by  the \nGovernment that is free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy, and mostly \nadjacent  to  existing  schools.  Only  subprojects  categorized  as  C13  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  its  policies  in  the  Operations  Manual,  and  meeting  the \nselection criteria for school sites, as set out in Appendix 6, will be selected.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n \nEthnic  minorities,  while  part  of  some  communes  assisted  under  the  Project,  are  not \n35. \nparticularly targeted. They will enjoy the benefits accruing to these communes and villages as \nmembers. Supplementary Appendix F contains analyses of gender and ethnic minority issues. \n \n\n4. \n\nGender Mainstreaming \n\n \n36. \nA five-year gender mainstreaming strategy was adopted by MOEYS in 2002. It has three \nmain  components:  (i)  equal  access  by  girls  to  education,  (ii)  enhancing  gender  equity  in \neducation  management  and  delivery  of  services,  and  (iii)  strengthening  gender  technical \ncapacity  in  education  programming  and  policy  making.  Project  design  has  drawn  on  this \nstrategy,  as  well  as  the  progress  reports  of  the  JFPR  scholarships  for  girls  program.  The \nMission suggested drawing up of an action plan with clear targets that the Project could support. \nAn  analysis  of  gender  issues  with  an  action  plan  and  program  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nPolicies  on  Gender  and  Development  and  Indigenous  Peoples  is  given  in  supplementary \nAppendix F. \n \n \n \n37. \nThe Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed and no significant adverse impacts \nwere identified. A civil works component covering water supply and toilet facilities is small-scale. \nActivities resulting from the Project will not cause pollution, health hazards, or soil erosion. The \nProject is categorized as Category C. The site selection, design, construction, replacement work \nand operation of school facilities will be implemented in accordance with the relevant regulations \nand standards of the Borrower as well as the ADB\u2019s environment policy.  \n\nEnvironment \n\n5. \n\n                                                 \n13  Category  C  projects  are  those  that  do  not  have  foreseen  involuntary  resettlement  effects. They  require  neither  a \n\nresettlement plan nor a resettlement framework. \n\n\f10 \n\nC. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe program loan will support policy interventions aimed at (i) improving equity in access \n38. \nto  education  and  training  services  through  pro-poor  systemic  and  targeted  interventions; \n(ii) improving  quality  and  internal  efficiency  through  more  effective  curriculum  organization, \nimproved student progression, enhancing the teaching and learning environment, and improved \nstandard  monitoring  and  quality  assurance;  (iii)  enhancing  capacity  for  greater  education \ndecentralization  through  strengthened  financial  planning,  management  and  audit  systems,  a \nmore  focused  human  resource  planning  system,  and  more  efficient  staff  performance \nmanagement, deployment and reward systems; and (iv) increasing resource mobilization linked \nto measures that ensure resource allocation is pro-poor, equitable and efficient.   \n \n39. \nSince the adoption of ESP and ESSP in 2001, the Government has realized some major \nachievements in education sector reform, facilitated by extensive policy and strategic dialogue \nwith  ADB  technical  assistance  and  advisory  support  from  UNICEF  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Agency (Sida), the World Bank, the European Commission and the \nNGO community. The next phase of ESP reform, from 2004 to 2008, is designed to deepen and \nextend  the  reform  program  with  a  view  to  achieving  (i)  further  reductions  in  cost  barriers  for \nbasic  education  access,  alongside  the  extension  of  well-regulated  and  managed  parental \ncontributions  in  post-basic  education;  (ii)  expansion  of  secondary  education  opportunities, \nespecially in poorer and underserved rural communes; (iii) a more demand-driven approach to \nexpanded  skills  training  opportunities,  especially  in  the  poorest  40%  of  communes  which  are \nseverely  underserved;  (iv)  improved  quality  and  standards  in  schools  by  strengthening \neducation  governance  mechanisms  and  accountability  at  the  school-community  interface;  and \n(v) greater delegated authority to provinces, districts and schools for planning and management \nof resources, alongside extensive capacity building in financial management and audit.  \n \n40. \nFaced  with  prospective  budget  constraints,  the  Government  recognizes  that  financial \nsustainability  will  require  not  only  additional  resource  mobilization,  but  also  gains  in  efficiency \nand  other  forms  of  cost  containment.  The  key  feature  of  this  phase  of  reform  will  be  to \nimplement systemic efficiency gains (e.g., reduce repetition and make more efficient use of staff \nand  facilities)  so  that  additional  resources  can  be  directed  towards  service  expansion.  This \nphase  also  recognizes  that  directing  more  resources  to  quality-oriented  activities  will  not  be \nenough  to  improve  standards.  Accordingly,  greater  emphasis  will  be  given  to  target  setting, \nstandard setting and student performance monitoring systems. A critical cross-cutting reform will \nbe  to  adjust  the  salary  and  nonsalary  shares  of  education  expenditure  through  gradual \nimprovements  in  performance-based  teacher  allowances,  building  on  the  initial  program \nintroduced  in  2002.  Increased  teacher  remuneration  is  also  designed  to  reduce  demands  for \ninformal  payments  from  parents  (a  major  access  barrier)  and  promote  increased  community \noversight and accountability of school performance.  \n \n41. \nThe  initial  phase  of  ESP  and  ESSP  implementation  benefited  from  high-level  political \nsupport,  strong  strategic  leadership,  and  significant  increases  in  Government  resources  for \neducation. It is recognized that the next phase of reform may face fiscal constraints and meet \nresistance  from  a  range  of  education  stakeholders.  ESDP  II  is  designed  to  meet  part  of  the \nadjustment  costs  and  to  contain  pressure  on  public  resources.  The  proposed  phasing  and \nsequencing  of  the  reforms,  particularly  undertaking  initial  capacity  building  before  nationwide \nimplementation,  is  designed  to  mobilize  support  and  ensure  that  the  reform  strategies  are \ntechnically sound.  \n\n\f11 \n\nESDP  proved  effective  at  providing  an  initial  policy  action  framework  for  education. \n42. \nConsultations  with  development  agencies  and  NGOs  intensified  over  the  last  few  years.  The \nESDP  policy  matrix  provided  a  framework  for  mobilization  of  additional  sector  budget  and \ninvestment  support  from  education  partners.  The  ESDP  II  policy  framework  will  facilitate \nongoing  policy  and  strategy  dialogue  with  the  Government,  the  MOEYS  and  partners  and \nprovide a basis for a phased and sequenced approach to mobilizing additional resources from \nthe Government and development agencies. \n \nFrom  the  perspective  of  the  education  sector,  the  SDP  approach  applied  in  Cambodia \n43. \nfits well with donor coordination and the Government\u2019s own  education priority agenda. ADB is \nthe acknowledged leader in the education sector in Cambodia and the program loan will enable \nADB  to  continue  its  leadership.  The  overall  design  is  balanced,  and  the  program  matrix  and \nactivities are consistent with the MDGs. The investment project reinforces the policy matrix by \nhelping the Government to expand and strengthen the system to meet the MDGs and the sector \nprogram goals. Development agencies in Cambodia have bought into the policy reform agenda \nunder the overall ESP program framework, which will enable convergence and efficient use of \nresources.  The  SDP  takes  the  process  of  Government,  development  agency,  NGO,  and  ADB \ncoordination  to  a  full  sector-wide  approach  that  can  serve  as  a  comprehensive  model  for  the \nregion. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n44. \nThe  medium-term  policy  framework  of  ESDP  II  is  described  in  the  development  policy \nletter  prepared  by  the  Government  (Appendix  7).  The  critical  policy  actions  related  to  the  four \nmain  sector  challenges  are  in  the  sector  core  policy  matrix  (Appendix  8).  The  policy  matrix \nspecifies (i) the anticipated outcomes and associated policy actions; (ii) implementation modes \nand  monitoring  arrangements;  (iii)  time  frame  for  specific  actions;  (iv)  indicative  phasing  and \nsequencing  of  actions  and  follow-up;  (v)  associated  legislative,  regulatory  and  governance \ninterministerial  coordination \nmeasures; \nrequirements;  and  (vii)  associated  resource  mobilization  and  allocation.  The  phasing  and \nsequencing of the proposed policy actions reflect the progressive and graduated nature of the \nimplementation  process,  recognizing  that  there  will  be  potential  constraints  and  risks.  These \npolicy  actions  and  related  recurrent  and  capital  budget  implications  will  be  guided  by  overall \nESP and ESSP financing framework.   \n \n\nresponsible  Government  agencies  and \n\n(vi) \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n45. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  education  policy reform  program  by \nproviding a program loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The loan \nwill have a term of 24 years, including an 8-year grace period and an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period, and 1.5% thereafter. The program will be implemented over a \nperiod of 3 years from the second quarter of 2005 to the end of 2007, and will be disbursed in \nthree tranches (see also para. 50). It is expected that completion will be in December 2007 and \nthe loan closing date will be 30 June 2008.  \n \n\n4. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n46.  MOEYS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  policy \nmeasures.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  the  program  and  project  loan.  The \ncommittee will be chaired by the secretary of state, MOEYS, and will comprise representatives \nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  the  Ministry  of  Planning,  the  Council  for \n\n\f12 \n\nAdministrative  Reform  (within  the  Council  of  Ministers),  the  Ministry  of  Interior,  MOEYS,  and \nMOWA. Other ministries such as the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Rural Development, and \nthe  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  and  Youth  Rehabilitation  may  be  invited.  Existing  technical \ncommittees  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  specific  components  of  the  program.  A \nsubcommittee,  chaired  by  MOLVT,  will  oversee  project  implementation  under  the  third \ncomponent of the Project. MEF will allocate and monitor the use of counterpart funds that will be \nused to support the education reform package. \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n47. \nThe program loan proceeds will be used to  finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  (Appendix  9)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nBorrower will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n\n6. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n48. \nThe counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will supplement \nthe Government\u2019s pro-poor budget, targeted at protecting service provision to the poor, and as \nagreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  protect  allocation  to  the  education  sector.  The \ncounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  by  the \nGovernment  in  order  of  priority:  (i)  to  finance  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the \npackage  of  education  policy  reforms  under  the  Program,  (ii)  as  part  of  the  contribution  of  the \nGovernment  to  ADB-funded  education  projects,  and  (iii)  as  part  of  the  contribution  of  the \nGovernment to ADB-funded projects in other social sectors.  \n \n\n7. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n49. \nThe  Government,  through  the  steering  committee,  will  monitor  the  implementation  of \npolicy,  legal  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the  program,  and  every  year  the \nGovernment,  ADB,  other  development  agencies,  and  NGOs  will  review  implementation  and \nassess  the  impact  of  all  reforms  in  the  education  sector  as  part  of  joint  education  sector \nperformance reviews. \n \nThe  loan  for  the  program  will  be  released  in  three  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of \n50. \n$5 million will be made available upon loan effectiveness and it is envisaged it will be disbursed \nin early or mid-2005. The second and third tranches of $7.5 million each will be released upon \ncompliance  with  agreed  conditions.  The  Government  will  be  required  to  fulfill  the  actions \nspecified  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  8)  and  to  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress  in  the \nimplementation of the rest of the program before the second and third tranches are released. It \nis expected that the second tranche will be released about 12 to 15 months after the release of \nthe first, or earlier, subject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions. It is expected that \nthe  third  tranche  will  be  released  about  12  months  after  the  release  of  the  second,  or  earlier, \nsubject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of the conditions for the third tranche.   \n \n51. \nIn order to assist coordination of policy conditions with those of other ongoing providers \nof budget support (e.g., the European Commission\u2019s) and future potential providers, the annual \njoint  ESSP  review  exercise  will  form  a  key  component  of  the  policy  performance  monitoring \nprocess. Satisfactory progress towards the finally agreed ESP core performance will also be a \n\n\f13 \n\nkey monitoring tool based on an overall judgment by ADB of: (i) equitable access, (ii) quality and \nefficiency,  and  (iii)  institutional  and  financial  performance  indicators.  Where  possible,  loan \nmonitoring and supervision and midterm review missions will be harmonized with the joint ESSP \nreview exercises. \n \nD. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n52. \nThe objectives of the Project are to supplement the policy initiatives under the Program \nand to enhance equitable access, improve the quality of lower and upper secondary education, \nand provide demand driven, community-based skills training opportunities mainly for the out-of-\nschool  youth,  in  underserved  areas,  through  (i)  lower  secondary  education  opportunities,  (ii) \nupper  secondary  education  opportunities,  and  (iii)  community-based  skills  training  in  poor \ncommunes. The investment project will (i) support key policy development in these three areas, \n(ii) complete the infrastructure requirements of lower secondary education and consolidate the \ngains  of  recent  years,  (iii)  establish  an  initial  network  of  high  quality  upper  secondary  model \nschools,  provide  schools  in  districts  where  there  are  none,  and  rehabilitate  existing  upper \nsecondary  schools  where  needed,  (iii)  enhance  capacity  of  national  and  provincial  training \nboards  to  facilitate  skills  training  in  the  poorest  communes,  (iv)  introduce  a  sustainable  skills \ntraining voucher system, and (v) strengthen standards monitoring at upper secondary and TVET \nand skills training levels. Core ESP performance indicators are in supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\na. \n\nExpanding Lower Secondary Education Opportunities \n\n53. \nThe  MOEYS  target  is  to  increase  enrollment  to  around  1  million  in  lower  secondary \neducation over the next 5 to 7 years. Currently, it is estimated that there are between 800 and \n900  communes  that  do  not  have  a  lower  secondary  school.  The  lack  of  immediate  access  to \nlower  secondary  schooling  in  these  communes  contributes  to  low  progression  and  transition \nrates from commune-based primary schools.  \n \n54. \nThe Project will provide improved access to lower secondary education in unserved and \nunderserved communes through: (i) provision of around 400 lower secondary school buildings \nin  selected  high-demand  communes,  and  (ii)  staff  development  (training  of  central,  provincial \nand  district  education  staff  for  decentralized  delivery  of  education;  planning,  financial \nmanagement,  monitoring;  district  and  community  level  program  implementation).  To  support \n(i) and  (ii),  the  Project  will  provide  equipment,  furniture,  instructional  materials,  computers, \ntraining, consulting services, civil works, utility vehicles and motorcycles. Detailed geographical \nand  other  targeting  criteria  will  be  based  on  a  basic  education  facilities  development  plan \nprepared by MOEYS in order to coordinate support from ADB, the World Bank, the Government \nof Belgium, the proposed JFPR project on incomplete schools and other potential donors. The \nselection criteria for school sites are in Appendix 6.  \n \n\nb. \n\nExpanding Upper Secondary Education Opportunities \n\n55. \nThe overall strategy is to ensure more equitable access to high-quality upper secondary \neducation  in  each  of  Cambodia\u2019s  provinces  in  order  to  produce  secondary  school  graduates \ncapable  of  undertaking  higher  and/or  further  education  studies.  Currently,  the  majority  of \nuniversity undergraduates and graduates originate from four or five provinces, resulting in over-\n\n\f14 \n\nreliance on deployment of these graduates (especially as teachers) to more remote provinces. \nThe  overall  strategy  is  to  create  a  virtuous  circle  of  linkage  between  high-quality  upper \nsecondary schools in each province, including an emphasis on science, mathematics and ICT. \nThese  students  will  be  fully  prepared  for  either  (i)  bachelor  degree  programs  at  the  Royal \nUniversity  of  Phnom  Penh  and  other  public  and  private  universities  or  (ii)  first  or  second  year \ncertificate of foundation studies at other higher education institutions. JICA is already supporting \nsome science, mathematics and ICT components of the program. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  improved  access  to  high-quality  upper  secondary  education  in \n56. \neach province through: (i) the construction of 24 model upper secondary school buildings with \nscience and computer laboratories, one in each province and municipality; (ii) the construction \nof  25  new  upper  secondary  schools  in  half  of  rural  districts  that  are  without  such  schools; \n(iii) refurbishment of 25 upper secondary schools; and (iv) staff development (training of central, \nprovincial and district education staff for decentralized delivery of education; planning, financial \nmanagement,  monitoring;  district  and  community  level  program  implementation).  To  support \n(i) and (ii), the Project will provide equipment, furniture, civil works, consulting services, training, \nlaboratory equipment, computers, office supplies, vehicles and motorcycles. It is envisaged that \nthe  24  model  secondary  schools  will  have  enrollments  of  1,500\u20132000  students  per  school  in \ngrades  10\u201312.  It  is  also  proposed  that,  under  the  program  loan,  10\u201320%  of  students  in  each \nschool  will  be  awarded  merit-driven  scholarships  under  the  upper  secondary  priority  action \nprogram (PAP) equitable access program.   \n \n\nc. \n\nDemand-Driven Community-Based Skills Training \n\nThe overall objective of this component is to initiate the first phase of a demand-driven \n57. \nand  community-based  skills  training  program.  This  will  include  establishing  a  network  for  the \nmanagement and organization of TVET and skills training planning at central, provincial, district \nand  commune  levels,  including  using  existing  providers  and  stimulating  new  providers.  The \ntarget groups comprise out-of-school youth, unemployed and underemployed youths and adults \nin the poorest 40% of communes in seven provinces14 initially, with priority given to the 15\u201321 \nage  group.  In  a  survey  of  school  leavers,  about  75%  in  this  age  group  expressed  interest  in \ntaking short skills training courses.  \n \n58. \nThe  proposed  component  consists  of  three  subcomponents:  (i)  NTF  support  for \ncommune  training  vouchers  in  seven  provinces  at  $5,000  per  commune  per  year  over  three \nyears for short courses in skills training; (ii) NTF equipment and facilities adjustment fund; and \n(iii)  central,  provincial  and  commune  TVET  system  capacity  building,  including  a  longer-term \nfurther  education  and/or  community  lifelong  learning  institutional  development  program.  To \nsupport  the  three  subcomponents,  the  Project  will  provide  (i)  equipment  and/or  facilities, \ncomputers  and  software;  furniture  for  industrial  skills  training,  commerce  and  business \nmanagement;  (ii)  training  to  central  staff  and  system  strengthening  at  the  National  Training \nBoard, Directorate General of TVET, and at provincial, district and commune levels at provincial \ntraining  centers,  provincial  training  boards,  and  provincial  training  committees  as  well  as  to \ncommunity  development  specialists;  (iii)  consulting  services  for  policy  and  institutional \ndevelopment, a community-based skills training system, institutional, management and financial \nsystems  development,  and  community  development;  (iv)  administrative  support  through  the \n                                                 \n14  The initial phase will cover 210 communes in these seven provinces. The selection will be based on a number of \ntraining  providers,  and  geographic \ncriteria \nrepresentation.  The  eligible  communes  within  each  province  will  be  those  that  belong  to  the  top  40%  ranked \naccording  to  the  weighted  average  of  poverty  index  (75%  weight)  developed  by  the  World  Food  Program  and \npopulation size (25% weight) since some communes have high poverty levels, but very small populations.  \n\nincidence,  population  size,  availability  of \n\nincluding  poverty \n\n\f15 \n\nprovision of office equipment and supplies, including computers, together with accessories and \nsoftware,  utility  vehicles  and  motorcycles.  The  overall  investment  cost  for  nationwide \nimplementation  is  estimated  at  $15  million.  However,  only  seven  provinces  will  initially  be \ncovered  at  an  investment  cost  of  around  $6  million.  Detailed  community-based  skills  training \nselection criteria are set out in Appendix 10.  \n \n59. \nThe  key  components  of  PTC  capacity  building  will  be  to:  (i)  facilitate  and  coordinate \nprovincial  and  commune  skills  training  plans;  (ii)  manage  the  activities  of  the  proposed \ncommunity  development  specialists  who  will  enable  formulation  and  implementation  of \ncommune  training  plans,  taking  account  of  potential  training  providers;  (iii)  support  the \noperations  of  the  provincial  training  boards  and  mobilize  and  coordinate  financing  at  the \nprovincial  level;  (iv)  organize  and  contract  private  sector  trainers;  (v)  coordinate  potential \nemployers  as  trainers  as  part  of  commune-level  training  delivery;  (vi)  coordinate  the  use  of \nNGOs  as  potential  training  partners;  and  (vii)  mobilize  wats,  village  trainers  and  community-\nbased  training  resources,  especially  for  informal  equivalency  programs,  HIV/AIDS  awareness, \nliteracy  and  self-learning  activities.  The  National  Technical  Training  Institute  will  assist  in  the \nimplementation of the overall program. \n \n\ni. \n\nNTF Support for Commune Training Vouchers \n\nThe  Project  will  use  National  Training  Board  (NTB),  whose  membership  will  be \n60. \nreconstituted  following  the  establishment  of  MOLVT,  and  the  NTF  to  implement  this \nsubcomponent.  The  main  activity  will  be  to  provide  the  poorest  communes  with  training \nvouchers  to  enable  a  more  demand-driven  approach.  The  award  of  the  voucher  to  individual \ncommunes will be based on the formulation of a skills training plan, which will be based on the \nneeds and opportunities in the community. A community development specialist from the PTC \nwill help to draw up the plan. The primary targets of the program are the poor. Within the seven \ntargeted provinces, the poorest 40% of communes will receive training vouchers of up to $5,000 \nper  year  for  the  next  three  years,  with  the  award  for  the  succeeding  year  subject  to  the \nperformance and disbursement of the preceding year.  \n \n61. \nIn the medium term, in order to ensure sustainability of financing for the voucher scheme \nand give beneficiaries greater exposure to enterprises, a corporate tax transfer program may be \nexplored.  Based  on  NTB\u2019s  planned  guidelines,  enterprises  paying  tax  will  be  eligible  for  three \ncategories  of  grants  linked  to  (i)  an  in-industry  graduate  training  program  at  approximately \ntechnician level; (ii) an employee-upgrading program focusing on enterprises upgrading staff to \nwork with higher level technology; and (iii) a training partnerships program between education \ninstitutions and enterprises. Eligible enterprises will apply directly to NTB.  \n \n\nii. \n\nThe NTF Equipment and Facilities Adjustment Fund \n\nA fund15 will be established within the NTF by NTB to respond to requests for tool banks \n62. \nor  minor  renovations  to  local community  lifelong  learning  centers  and  institutions. Applications \nfrom  these  community  lifelong  learning  centers  and  institutions,  endorsed  by  the  PTC,  will  be \nsubmitted  to  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET,  evaluated  in  terms  of  NTB  priorities,  and,  if \nsuccessful, recommended to NTB for approval. Individual grants will be up to $15,000.  NTB is \nexpected to continue its supervisory responsibility over NTF.  \n \n\n                                                 \n15  A separate account within the NTF under the NTB amounting to $0.5 million in the initial phase of the Project. \n\n\f16 \n\niii. \n\nTVET System Capacity Building \n\n63. \nThe  program  will  consist  of  (i)  strengthening  the  operations  of  the  NTB,  guided  by  a \nthree-year  rolling  national  skills  development  plan,  formulated  in  conjunction  with  private \nenterprises  and  other  stakeholders;  (ii)  rationalizing  and  sustaining  the  NTF,  including  re-\ndirecting  existing  TVET  PAP  funding,  mobilizing  other  resources,  and  gradually  increasing \nprovincial  and  community  contributions;  (iii)  strengthening  links  with  existing  micro-credit \nschemes accessible to skills training graduates; (iv) establishing a national association of TVET \nproviders  as  part  of  strengthened  skills  standards  and  quality  assurance  mechanisms; \n(v) strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET  for  policy  and  planning  and \nenabling  joint  public\u2013private  partnership  in  skills  training  delivery  and  impact  monitoring;  and \n(vi) moving  towards  the  establishment  of  a  National  Institute  of  Technology.  The  ADB  Basic \nSkills Project has enabled the creation of a network of PTCs and further expansion to cover all \nprovinces  is  anticipated  in  late  2004  or  early  2005.  The  objective  of  this  component  is  to \nstrengthen the role of the PTCs in coordinating skills training, with gradual incorporation of these \nactivities into broader organizational reforms of further education or community lifelong learning \ncenters.  \n \n64. \nIt  is  proposed  that  the  first  phase  of  support  under  ESDP  II  should  focus  on  the \nimplementation  of  this  demand-driven  skills  training  program  in  seven  provinces,  including \n(i) seed  money  for  the  establishment  of  the  training  voucher  scheme  amounting  to  around \n$4.2 million  over  the  period  2005\u20132009;  (ii)  coverage  of  the  initial  equipment  and  facilities \nupgrade fund in the PTCs, amounting to $0.5 million over 2005\u20132009; and (iii) coverage by the \ninitial decentralized PTC capacity building program, amounting to $1.0 million over 2005\u20132008.  \n \n65. \nThe selection of the communes to be supported during this first phase will be based on \nagreed poverty-targeting criteria. The program will be used to (i) introduce the voucher scheme; \n(ii) upgrade facilities and equipment in the PTCs, including tool banks; and (iii) build capacity of \nthe  provincial  training  board,  PTC  staff  and  training  personnel,  especially  the  community \ndevelopment  specialists.  These  financing  modes,  especially  the  NTF  and  training  voucher \nscheme,  are  designed  to  facilitate  complementary  financing  from  other  development  agencies \nwithin  an  agreed  strategic  management  and  implementation  framework,  including  related \ncapacity building.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $25 million equivalent from its Special Funds \n66. \nresources to cover 74% of the total project cost, including $13.9 million equivalent of the foreign \nexchange cost and $11.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB financing of the local \ncurrency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income (about $290 per capita, \nestimated  in  2002),  and  savings  (14.2%  of  the  national  income  in  2000),  as  well  as  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal deficit (6.1% of gross domestic product, estimated in 2002). The balance of \n$8.58 million will be financed by the Government. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years \nwith a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. Part of the ADB-supported \nproject  loan  and  Government  funding  will  be  made  available  to  participating  communities  and \ninstitutions as block grants to contribute to the funding of approved subprojects. \n \nThe  cost  of  the  investment  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  duties, \n67. \ntaxes  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at  $33.6  million  equivalent.  The  foreign \nexchange cost is $13.9 million equivalent, or 41% of the total. The local currency cost, including \n\n\f17 \n\nduties  and  taxes,  is  $19.7  million  equivalent,  or  59%  of  the  total.  Cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 1.

MOEYS will be the Executing Agency for the lower and upper secondary components of \nthe Project and will be responsible for coordinating the overall implementation. Implementation \nperformance of MOEYS has been rated satisfactory and the implementation of previous projects \nfunded by ADB has been assessed as successful. For the centralized system, the Department \nof  Materials  and  State  Property  (DMSP)  will  be  responsible  for  operational  management  and \nimplementation,  including  building  standards,  procurement  of  contractors  and  community \nservices for construction, site supervision and disbursement, and accounting of loan funds. For \nthe  delegated  system,  DMSP  will  delegate  the  construction  and  supervision  functions  to  the \nprovincial education facilities committees.  \n \n69. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  build  capacity  in  Departments  of  Primary  and \nSecondary  Education  to  plan  and  manage  implementation  of  these  components  of  the \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nExecuting Agency: Community-Based Skills Training Component \n\ninvestment  project,  including  provincial-level  strengthening  of  personnel  management  and \ndeployment  systems.  Where  appropriate,  DMSP  will  assist  these  departments  to  fulfill  their \nresponsibilities  and  assist  with  any  further  decentralized  mechanisms  to  develop  education \nfacilities.  The  consulting  services  for  upper  secondary  schools  facilities  planning  and \nmanagement  will  be  located  in  departments  of  secondary  education.  Building  on  ESDP \narrangements,  MOEYS  will  delegate  existing  DMSP  technical  staff  to  provide  any  necessary \nfield  site  supervision  and  construction  monitoring  as  required,  drawing  on  the  vehicles, \ncomputers, other equipment and furniture provided under previous projects, i.e., the Emergency \nFlood Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1824) and ESDP. \n \n \n \nThe  new  MOLVT  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  community-based  skills  training \n70. \ncomponent  and  will  be  responsible  for  its  overall  implementation.  A  project  management  unit \n(PMU) headed by a senior official of MOLVT will be located at the Directorate General of TVET \nand will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Project. The head of the PMU will be \nresponsible for organizing the team, together with consultants and staff drawn from the various \nunits of MOLVT. The PMU head will be appointed by the minister, MOLVT, and implementation \nof  this  subcomponent  will  be  the  direct  responsibility  of  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET. \nImplementation  will  be  consistent  with  the  decentralization  policy  of  the  Government  as \nespoused in its Rectangular Strategy.  \n \n71. \nThe  provincial  training  board  of  the  provincial  training  center/community  center \n(PTC/CC) of the selected provinces will provide project oversight at the provincial, district and \ncommune levels. The director of the PTC/CC will be the key point person at the provincial level \nand  will  be  assisted  by  the  staff  of  the  PTC/CC,  specifically  the  community  development \nspecialists, who will be responsible for helping communes to identify training needs and draw up \ntraining  plans.  The  PTC/CC  director  will  report  to  the  PTB  who  in  turn  will  report  to  the  PMU. \nDetailed implementation arrangements are in supplementary Appendix H. \n \n72. \nConsulting  services  will  build  capacity  in  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET,  the  NTB, \nNTF,  Provincial  Training  Boards  of  the  PTCs,  the  PTCs,  the  National  Association  of  Training \nProviders, the Association of Micro-credit Providers, and the Sectoral Councils. The consulting \nservices  for  TVET  system  development  and  management  will  be  located  in  the  Directorate \nGeneral of TVET.  \n \n\nc. \n\nSteering Committee \n\n \n73. \nThe steering committee for the Program loan will also be the steering committee for the \nproject  loan  (para.  46).  The  Steering  Committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Secretary  of  State  of \nMOEYS  and  will  comprise  representatives  from  MEF,  MOEYS,  MOLVT,  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning, the Council for Administrative Reform (within the Council of Ministers), the Ministry of \nJustice,  the Ministry  of  the  Interior, MOWA,  the  Ministry  of Rural  Development,  the  Ministry  of \nUrban  and  Land  Management;  and  the  Ministry  of  Social  Affairs  and  Youth  Rehabilitation.  A \nsubcommittee, chaired by MOLVT, will be established to oversee project implementation under \nthe third component of the Project. The subcommittee will report to the Steering Committee. The \nsubcommittee  will  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and \nFisheries;  the  Ministry  of  Tourism;  the  Ministry  of  Commerce;  and  the  Ministry  of  Industries, \nMines and Energy. \n \n\n\f19 \n\nThe  Steering  Committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  policy  direction  and  project \n74. \noversight. Its responsibilities will include (i) approval of annual programs and budget allocations, \n(ii)  overseeing  progress  and  compliance  with  agreed  guidelines,  (iii)  commissioning  and \napproving  accounts  and  reports  required  by  the  Project,  and  (iv)  ensuring  that  agreed  audit \nrequirements  are  satisfied.  It  will  delegate  responsibilities  to  appropriate  MOEYS  departments \nand the Directorate General of TVET of MOLVT. For the lower and upper secondary education \ncomponents,  lead  coordination  for  facilities  planning  and  targeting  will  be  the  responsibility  of \nthe  Directorate  General  of  Education,  including  the  departments  of  primary  education  and \nsecondary education. A sub-committee, chaired by MOLVT, shall be established to oversee the \nProject implementation under component 3 of the Project. The sub-committee shall report to the \nSteering  Committee.  The  sub-committee  shall  include  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Ministry of Tourism; Ministry of Commerce; and the Ministry \nof Industries, Mines and Energy. \n \n\nd. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \nAll ADB-financed goods and services procured for the Project will be in accordance with \n75. \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. DMSP, under the supervision of the General Department of \nAdministration  and  Finance  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement,  including  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (if  any),  local  competitive  bidding  (e.g.,  for  civil  works),  and  international \nshopping or direct purchase of furniture and classroom equipment, laboratory equipment, deep-\nwell  water  pumps,  motorcycles  and  utility  vehicles).  Indicative  procurement  packages  are  in \nAppendix 12.  \n \nEach  contract  for  the  supply  of  goods,  equipment,  furniture,  and  instructional  materials \n76. \nestimated to cost more than $500,000 equivalent will be awarded on the basis of international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Contract packages of $100,000\u2013$500,000 equivalent will follow \ninternational shopping procedures. Items with a value of less than $100,000 equivalent may be \nprocured  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.  Civil  works,  as  they  are  small  in  amount,  numerous  and \nscattered  in  rural  areas  across  the  country,  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local  competitive \nbidding  following  Government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Proper  maintenance  and \nservicing capacities and frameworks, especially for computers and vehicles at the project sites, \nwill be ensured.   \n \n \n \nTo  expedite  project  implementation,  an  imprest  account  will  be  established  at  a \n77. \ncommercial bank acceptable to both the Government and ADB. Two second-generation imprest \naccounts  in  the  names  of  MOEYS  and  MOLVT,  respectively,  will  also  be  established  at  a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  both  ADB  and  the  Government.  For  expenditure  incurred  at \nprovincial level, normal Government fund transfers to provinces will be adopted. The Provincial \nDepartment of Education, Youth and Sport will be requested to open a dedicated account, either \nthrough  the  provincial  treasury  or  an  MEF-approved  rural  commercial  bank.  In  the  provinces, \ndocuments  of  expenditure  will  be  kept  by  school  committees  supervised  by  Department  of \nEducation, Youth and Sport Office; signatories will be the chair of the committee, school director \nand accountant. \n \n78. \nThe  imprest  account  and  the  second-generation  imprest  accounts  will  be  established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(1 January 2001). The imprest account will have a ceiling of $1 million. The second-generation \nimprest  accounts  will  have  ceilings  of  $400,000  each.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \n\nDisbursement \n\ne. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  to  the \nimprest  account.  These  procedures  will  be  applicable  to  contracts  amounting  to  $100,000  or \nless.  Statements  of  expenditure  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  the  Bank\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001). \n \n\nf. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n79. \nPlanning  and  management  will  be  supported  by  consulting  services,  whose  two  main \nobjectives  will  be  (i)  to  facilitate  the  planning  of  the  lower  and  upper  secondary  education \nfacilities program, including establishment of strategic links with teacher training, retraining and \nnew  staff  deployment  programs,  and  (ii)  to  support  the  organizational  development  of  the \ncommunity-based  skills  training  program,  especially  the  strengthening  the  planning  and \ncoordination  role  of  the  provincial  NTB  and  PTCs.  In  both  components,  the  scope  will  be  to \nadvise on the implementation of nationwide programs, including the phasing and sequencing of \nexpansion.  A  total  of  65  person-months  of  international  and  150  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  required.  International  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged  as  a  firm  by  the  executing  agencies  using  the  quality-and-cost-based  selection \n(QCBS) method. A summary of consulting services and an outline of the terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 13. \n \n\ng. \n\nStaff Development Program \n\nStaff  development  under  the  Project  will  consolidate  the  gains  achieved  under  ESDP \n80. \nand  extend  institutional  reform  and  capacity  building  for  decentralization,  especially  by \nstrengthening  central  and  provincial  financial  management  and  monitoring  and  sector-wide \nprogram planning, management and monitoring.  It will strengthen institutions and capabilities at \nthe  grassroots  level,  especially  the  roles  and  functions  of  the  district  and  community  levels  in \nensuring \nto  policy  and  program \nimplementation.  Staff  development  activities  will  include  (i)  training  of  public  accountants  at \ncentral,  provincial  and  district  levels;  (ii)  training  of  internal  auditors;  (iii)  training  of  school \ndirectors in school development planning and financial management; (iv) training of central and \nprovincial directors in strategic leadership; and (v) training in sectoral and program monitoring at \nvarious levels. A detailed staff development program is in Appendix I. \n \n\ntimely  and  efficient \n\ninformation  related \n\ntransfer  of \n\nh. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n81. \nThe  implementation  period  will  be  for  five  years  and  the  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted  by  31  December  2009.  The  loan  closing  date  is  30  June  2010.  A  quarterly  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 14. \n \n\ni. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits  \n\n82. \nThe Government will ensure that all records and accounts to identify goods and services \nfinanced  from  the  proceeds  of  the  project  loan  will  be  maintained.  Separate  accounts  for  the \nProject will be maintained, and independent auditors acceptable to the ADB will audit accounts \nand  financial  statements  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Certified \ncopies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the close \nof each fiscal year.   \n \n\n\f21 \n\n83.  MOEYS  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and \nseparately for the program loan, and submit them to ADB within 30 days of each quarter. The \nreports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate, among other things, (i) progress \nagainst targets, both technical and financial; (ii) status of performance indicators; (iii) problems \nencountered during the quarter, and steps taken and proposed to be taken to resolve problems \nidentified;  (iv)  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  program  activities  proposed  for  the \nsucceeding  quarter.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  three \nmonths after the physical completion of the Project. \n \n\nj. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n84. \nESDP  II  will  provide  substantial  support  to  developing  management,  monitoring  and \nevaluation  capacities  in  the  Departments  of  Secondary  Education,  under  the  direction  of  the \nDirectorate  General  of  Education,  and  the  Directorate  General  of  TVET.  For  the  lower  and \nupper secondary education development component, progress monitoring will draw on existing \ncentral, provincial, and district education authorities.  The benefits of the Project will be captured \nthrough the improved education management information and monitoring systems. In addition, \nthe  Project  will  provide  for  complementary  benefit  monitoring  studies,  including  surveys. \nFacilities  development  implementation  monitoring  will  draw  on  existing  services  and  capacity \nwithin DMSP.   \n \n85. \nFor the TVET and skills training component, overall monitoring will be coordinated by the \nDirectorate  General  of  TVET.    Progress  monitoring  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  provincial \ntraining  boards  and  complemented  by  annual  surveys  of  beneficiaries,  stakeholders  and \ncommune councils. \n \n\nk. \n\nAnti-Corruption Measures \n\nDuring  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anti-corruption  policy  was  explained  to  government \n86. \nofficials,  particularly  the  section  on  fraud  and  corruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy,  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Capacity \nbuilding to strengthen education governance and regulations will support anticorruption efforts. \n \n\nl. \n\nRegular and Midterm Reviews \n\n87. \nAnnually, the Government, ADB, other development agencies, and NGOs will review the \nimplementation  and  assess  the  impact  of  all  reforms  in  the  education  sector  as  part  of  joint \neducation sector performance reviews. In addition to annual and other reviews, during the third \nyear of project implementation, the Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review \nof the Project. The review will identify changes since the time of appraisal, reassess the impact \nwith  regard  to  future  project  implementation  and  sustainability,  assess  implementation \nperformance against project performance indicators, review and establish compliance with loan \ncovenants, identify problems and constraints, and propose changes to the Project, if necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n88. \nESDP II will provide the policy and strategic framework for addressing capacity building \nconcerns  in  a  number  of  areas,  including  (i)  decentralization  of  the  education  services \nmanagement;  (ii)  upper  secondary  education  policy  analysis  and  strategic  planning; \n(iii) strategic  management  of  the  expanded  community-based  skills  training  program;  and \n(iv) strengthening  policy-led  education  governance  and  regulatory  reform.  The  overall  MOEYS \n\n\f22 \n\ncapacity building strategy with ADB support will be coordinated with that of other development \nagencies, especially the European Commission, UNICEF, Sida, JICA and World Bank.   \n \nIt  is  planned  that  ESDP  II  will  be  accompanied  by  an  advisory  TA16  in  an  amount  of \n89. \n$500,000,  designed  to  strengthen  MOEYS\u2019s  capacity  to  plan  and  implement  education \nregulatory  reform  and  governance  for  decentralization.  The  proposed  objectives  and  scope  of \nthe  advisory  TA  are  to  (i)  support  a  new  education  law  and  preparation  of  key  regulations \nrelated to improved institutional and financial governance with a target of legislation approval by \nend 2004, and other selective regulations from early 2005 onwards; (ii) improve transparency in \nuse  of  parental  and  private  contributions  to  schools  and  other  institutions,  through  new \nguidelines on accounting and management of these contributions, with a target of implementing \nthe  guidelines  from  early  2005;  and  (iii)  improve  governance  of  schools  and  postsecondary \ninstitutions,  by  issuing  guidelines  that  set  out  powers  and  responsibilities  of  education \nauthorities, parents and community associations with a target of issuing the guidelines by early \n2005. In addition, new financial regulations will be needed to underpin the anticipated education \nstaff pay reform strategy.   \n \n90. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $590,000  equivalent,  comprising  $426,000  in \nforeign  exchange  and  $164,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB  to  finance  $500,000  equivalent  covering  all  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $74,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $90,000, by providing office accommodation, utilities, administrative \nsupport, and the remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff and task forces. A brief on the \nadvisory TA and details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 15. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n\n91. \nThe  policy  reforms  supported  by  the  ESDP  II  program  loan  will  generate  medium-term \nbenefits by improving equity and efficiency by redistributing education resources provided by the \nGovernment and development agencies, including financial, human and physical infrastructure, \nto the poorest 40% of communes in Cambodia.  Preliminary analysis indicates that over the five \nyears  of  the  ESP  implementation  (2004\u20132008),  which  ESDP  II  will  enable,  the  share  of \nprojected spending in the poorest 40% of communes will rise from 28% to 36%, compared with \na decrease in the share spent on the richest 40% of communes from 50% to 42%. Similarly, the \nprojected  spending  on  girls  will  increase  from  42%  of  projected  total  capital  and  recurrent \nspending in 2004 to 46% of spending by 2008, through systemic and targeted support in areas \nof low female enrolment and participation. An economic and financial analysis of ESDP II is in \nAppendix J.   \n \n92. \nThe  medium-term  benefits  of  the  ESP  2004\u20132008  reforms,  which  ESDP  II  and  other \ndonor  assistance  will  enable,  will  be:  (i)  increased  participation  in  basic  education  for  an \nestimated  0.8  million  students  in  the  poorest  40%  of  communes;  (ii)  increased  participation  in \nupper secondary education for around 0.2 million students; (iii) enabling an additional 0.6 million \nchildren  to progress  annually  to  the  next  grade  of  school,  with  savings  of  around  KR24  billion \n($6 million) to the Government and KR6 billion ($1.5 million) to parents; and (iv) expanded skills \ntraining opportunities for over 270,000 youths and adults in the poorest 40% of communes over \n5  years  during  the  initial  phase  of  this  project  component.  The  longer-term  benefits  will  be  to \nprovide more accessible and relevant formal education to about 4.2 million school-age children \n\n                                                 \n16  ADTA  for  Capacity  Building  in  Education  Regulatory  Reform  and  Governance,  in  the  amount  of  $500,000,  is \n\nincluded in ADB\u2019s country program for Cambodia in 2004. \n\n\f23 \n\nand  to  put  in  place  cost-effective  and  accessible  skills  training  programs  for  an  estimated \n3.3 million underemployed youth aged 12\u201321 years.  \n \n93. \nOther  medium-  and  long-term  benefits  accruing  from  increased  participation  of  girls  in \nschooling  will  be:  (i)  reduced  risk  of  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS,  child  labor  and  trafficking, \nespecially in cross-border areas; (ii) improved family health, nutrition and child attendance; and \n(iii)  greater  opportunities  for  accessing  micro-credits  for  small  business  development,  using \nskills training credentials as collaterals.  \n \n94. \nLimited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process and lack of consistency in \npolicy  and  strategic  decision  pose  potential  risks,  which  could  undermine  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  reform  process.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  in  a  number  of  ways,  including:  (i)  the \nextensive  ESP  2004\u20132008  policy  dialogue  process;  (ii)  the  follow-up  review  and  assessment \nprocess with development agencies and NGOs to secure broad support and mutual confidence \nin the feasibility of the reform agenda; (iii) the annual ESSP review process, which facilitates a \nphased and sequenced approach to policy implementation; and (iv) provision of ADB and other \ndevelopment  agency  advisory  support  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related  legislative  and \nregulatory reforms.   \n \nAn uncertain fiscal climate and unforeseen developments (e.g., the outbreaks of SARS17 \n95. \nin  2003  and  avian  influenza  in  2004)  pose  further  potential  risks,  which  may  undermine  the \npredictability of Government resources for education, especially the significant transitional costs \nassociated  with  policy  reforms.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  in  a  number  of  ways,  including \n(i) extensive  dialogue  on  the  medium-term  resource  availability  for  education;  (ii)  using  the \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  process  as  a  basis  for  identifying  potential  budget \nshortfalls  and  for  mobilizing  increased  sector  budget  support,  including  the  proposed  ESDP  II \nprogram  loan  and  ongoing  European  Commission  support;  (iii)  extensive  sector  efficiency \nmeasures  to  contain  expenditure  growth;  and  (iv)  strong  policy  linkage  with  the  Government\u2019s \nbroader public financial management reforms, especially anticipated measures to ensure annual \nbudget realism. \n \n96. \nThe  limited  capacity  of  MOEYS  and  MOLVT  to  manage  and  implement  the  revised \npolicies  and  strategies  is  another  potential  risk,  especially  for  the  proposed  TVET  and  skills \ntraining  expansion.  Implementation  of  the  Project  by  technical  personnel  based  on  a  policy  of \ndecentralization down to the provincial and district levels is essential for capacity building. The \nfunctions  and  organizational  structures  of  NTB  and  NTF,  key  organizations \nthe \nimplementation  of  community-based  skills  training  component,  need  to  be  maintained.  An \nassociated risk for both the upper secondary facilities component and TVET and skills training is \npossibility  that  they  may  not  be  sustainable.  These  potential  risks  will  be  mitigated  through \n(i) provision  of  extensive  advisory  support  for  subsectoral  and  program  planning  and \nmanagement; (ii) extensive dialogue on upper secondary and TVET and skills training financing; \nand (iii) front loaded technical assistance to ensure that an appropriate legislative and regulatory \nframework is in place.  \n \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n17 Severe acute respiratory syndrome. \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOEYS  have  given  the \n\n97. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n98. \n \n\nFor the program and project loans:  \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as \ndescribed in the policy letter, including the policy matrix under ESDP, continue in \neffect for the duration of the ESDP II period and subsequently; and (b) promptly \nadopt the other policies and take the actions indicated in the ESDP II as specified \nin  the  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  and  ensure  that  such  policies  and \nactions continue in effect during and after the ESDP II period. \n\nThe Government will ensure an adequate supply of appropriately qualified lower \nand upper secondary school teachers in the selected project schools. \n\n \nFor the project loan: \n\n99. \n \n\nThe project task force in the case of MOEYS will be established and the heads \nand staff appointed. \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submissions  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation  requests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriate  funds \nduring each year of project implementation. \n\nThe Government, through MOEYS, will ensure that construction of new schools \nwill  be  carried  out  on  vacant  Government-owned \nfrom  all \nencumbrances,  habitation,  dispute  or  controversy.  Only  subprojects  categorized \nas  C  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  meeting \nthe  eligibility  criteria  for  the  selection  of  school  sites,  as  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB, will be selected.  \n\nland, \n\nfree \n\nThe  Government,  through  MOEYS,  will  ensure  priority  will  be  given  to  gender \nand  ethnic  minority  development  through  the  implementation  of  the  gender  and \nethnic  minorities  action  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ngender  and  development  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  Government,  through \nMOEYS,  will  further  ensure  that  (a)  priority  will  be  given  to  girls  and  women  in \norder  to  achieve  their  maximum  participation  in  lower  and  upper  secondary \nschools  and  in  the  training  provided  under  the  TVET  and  skills  training \ncomponent; and (b) in order to increase the quality of and access to education by \nethnic  minorities,  they  will  have  equal  opportunities  to  participate  in  lower  and \nupper secondary education and the training provided under the TVET and skills \ntraining  component.  The  project\u2018s  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  will  be  observed \nduring project monitoring and evaluation. \n\n\f25 \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nAlthough  no  significant  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified,  the  site \nselection,  design,  construction,  replacement  work  and  operation  of  school \nfacilities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  government \nregulations  and  standards  as  well  as  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policy  and \nenvironmental assessment guidelines. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n100.  For the program loan: \n \n\nAll  conditions  for  the  release  of  the  Program  Loan  first  tranche,  as  set  out  in \nAppendix 7 will have been satisfied. \n\nMOEYS will have prepared an action plan for assuring universal basic education \ncoverage, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe steering committee will have been established and the members appointed.  \n\n \n101.  For the project loan: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe PMU will have been established and the head and staff appointed. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n102. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,344,000 to \nthe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Second  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 16,680,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Second Education Sector Development Project \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n \n \n\n17 November 2004 \n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nEDUCATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nSector Performance Overview: 2000\u20132004 \n\nA. \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Education,  Youth  and  Sport  (MOEYS)  has  been  implementing  an \n1. \nextensive education reform program since 2000, encapsulated in the Education Strategic Plan \n(ESP)  and  Education  Sector  Performance  Program  (ESSP)  2001\u201305.  The  overall  priority  has \nbeen to (i) expand equitable access to 9 years of high-quality basic education, (ii) improve the \nquality and efficiency of education services, and (iii) expand and regulate the quality of a public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  in  postbasic  education.  The  overarching  financing  strategy  is  to  implement \npro-poor  systemic  and  targeted  interventions,  especially  through  recurrent  priority  action \nprograms and expanded school and institutional facilities development in underserved areas.  \n \n2. \nThe  National  Education  for  All  Plan  was  approved  in  mid-2003.  It  sets  out  longer-term \ngoals  and  targets,  focusing  on  achieving  universal  primary  education  and  basic  education \nprovision  by  2010,  or  at  the  latest  by  2015,  in  line  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs). In 2001, the Government reduced cost barriers to basic education by abolishing start-\nof-the-year  parental  contributions  and  introduced  operational  budgets  for  all  schools  and \ninstitutions. The past four years have seen significant increases in quality-oriented operational \nsupport, especially for basic supplies, textbooks and teacher training.  \n \n3. \nGovernment  spending  on  education  has  risen  significantly,  from  about  14%  of  the \nnational budget in 2000, to 19.5% in 2004. Expenditure on basic education has been 70\u201375% of \noverall  recurrent  spending.  Donor  support  for  the  sector  has  risen  to an  estimated  $50  million \nper annum, including recurrent budget support, initially from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand  the  European  Commission,  expanded  investments  in  facilities  and  capacity-building \nprograms. Financial management has been extensively decentralized to a network of about 200 \nbudget management centers, alongside substantial capacity building in sector performance and \nfinancial monitoring.    \n \nEducation partnership arrangements have been strengthened through the introduction of \n4. \nan  annual  ESSP  review  exercise, \nthe  MOEYS,  donors  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). MOEYS produces an annual ESSP performance report, \nwhich is used as the basis for strategic review and negotiation, alongside separate donor and \nNGO reports that analyze performance and future priorities.   \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThere  has  been  encouraging  growth  in  access  at  all  levels  of  the  system.  Since  2000, \nprimary  school  enrollment  has  increased  from  about  2.2  million  in  2000  to  an  estimated \n2.7 million  in  2004.  Net  enrollment  rates  (NER)  are  currently  about  90%,  with  most  of  the \nimprovements being in poor rural areas. Female enrollment is estimated to be 89%, indicating \ngrowing  gender  parity  at  the  primary  level.  At  lower  secondary  grades  7  to  9,  enrollment  has \ngrown  from  about  250,000  to  460,000  in  the  past  four  years,  with  net  enrollment  about  21% \n(20% female). There is still low basic education enrollment in many border areas and in areas \nwith significant ethnic minority populations. The grade 6\u20137 transition rate between 2001/02 and \n2002/03 was over 83.4%, compared with 82.6% and 77.3% in the two previous academic years. \nSuperficially, these transition rates appear to be quite encouraging. However, in reality they are \na consequence of previously high repetition and dropout rates in primary grades, resulting in a \nsmall  grade  6  cohort.  Similarly,  the  difference  between  lower  secondary  gross  and  net \n\nRecent Primary, Secondary and Post-Secondary Access Trends \n\njointly  coordinated  by \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n27 \n\nenrollment rates (GER 38% and NER 20%) indicates that over 75% of the new intake into grade \n7 is older than 12 years of age. \n \n6. \nEnrollment growth in upper secondary grades 10 to 12 has been disappointingly slow. In \nthe  past  five  years,  enrollment  has  grown  from  about  110,000  to  154,000.  Net  enrollment  is \nestimated at 8%, which is among the lowest in the region. Girls and ethnic minority students are \nsignificantly  underrepresented,  with  females  representing  about  33%  of  the  total.  The  primary \nconstraints  are  continuing  requirements  for  informal  contributions  from  parents,  especially  at \nsecondary level, and lack of lower secondary and upper secondary facilities in many rural and \nethnic minority districts and communes.  \n \n7. \nThe main constraints in accelerating implementation of education for all are (i) late entry \ninto primary school by female students and students from poor families; (ii) significant rates of \nrepetition  and  early  dropout  in  primary  school  (about  15%  annually);  (iii)  the  existence  of \nincomplete  primary  schools  which  do  not  offer  the  full  range  of  grades  1  to  6;  (iv)  the  uneven \nprovision  of  secondary-level  facilities  across  the  country;  and  (v)  uneven  distribution  of \nexperienced  teachers,  with  fewer  being  posted  to  rural  and  remote  areas.  The  overarching \nconstraints  are  informal  cost  barriers  for  students  and  the  direct  cost  of  travelling  to  school, \nespecially if it is some distance from home. A further contributory factor is the wide disparity in \naccess to early childhood care and development, with only 7% coverage nationwide, mainly in \nurban areas.  \n \n8. \nThere has been enormous growth in higher education in the past five years, with much \nof the growth in the private sector. Current enrollment is about 45,000 with an estimated 25,000 \nstudents in public institutions.  The majority of students pay fees, with only about 8,000 students \nreceiving some form of government subsidy. However, there are continued inequities in access \nto  higher  education.  Most  of  the  higher  education  institutions,  both  public  and  private,  are  in \nPhnom  Penh.  Most  of  the  students  come  from  either  Phnom  Penh  or  other  more  urbanized \nprovinces.  Females  continue  to  be  significantly  underrepresented  because  of  their  low \nenrollment  and  consequent  low  rates  of  graduation  from  grade  12  and  the  absence  of  higher \neducation dormitories. \n \nThe  main  strategic  priorities  for  expanding  equitable  access  to  higher  education  are \n9. \n(i) progressive  provision  of  initial  higher  education  opportunities  in  regional  and  provincial \ninstitutions;  (ii)  ensuring  a  supply  of  high-quality  undergraduates \nfrom  all  provinces; \n(iii) expansion of merit-driven scholarships for students from poor families; and (iv) expansion of \nlower  level  entry  programs  into  higher  education,  possibly  through  associate  degrees, \nfoundation  studies  or  equivalency  programs.  An  overarching  consideration  is  enabling  more \nhigher education opportunities within a framework of effective quality assurance and information \non value for money.  \n \n10. \nThe technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and skills training sector is \ncharacterized by a diversity of public, private and NGO providers. Public TVET institutions have \nan  enrollment  of  about  7,000  students  per  annum  and  commercial  and  NGO  providers  4,000 \nstudents. In contrast, large and small enterprises, including family businesses, provide on-the-\njob  skills  training  for  about  135,000  students  per  annum.  The  strategic  priority  is  to  improve \nequitable access to skills training programs for the 12\u201321 age group, about 3.3 million potential \nstudents in 2002. Currently, only an estimated 0.6 million (18%) are in some form of education \nor training. The poorest rural communes are especially underserved, representing a constraint \non  rural  income  generation,  rural  economic  diversification  and  overall  rural  workforce \nproductivity, especially in the agriculture sector.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nEducation Service Efficiency Trends and Priorities \n\n11.  Matching  teacher  education  supply  and  demand  with  proposed  education  sector \nexpansion is a critical issue. Current supply and demand is set by intake ceilings in provincial \nand  regional  teacher  training  colleges  determined  by  the  Council  of  Ministers.  The  2002/03 \nenrollment was 9,200, about 4% more than in 2001/02. Forward planning must take account of \nthe  projected  fall  in  overall  primary  enrollment  after  2006  and  expansion  of  secondary \nenrollment, requiring a reorientation of provincial and regional teacher training college capacity \ntowards  increased  share  of  secondary  school  teacher  trainees.  The  Ministry  has  introduced \nspecific guidelines for the recruitment of teacher trainees from remote areas (1,534 in 2002/03, \n25% of the total) in order to improve education services in remote schools. The strategic priority \nwill  be  to  review  the  roles  and  intake  levels  of  the  National  Institute  of  Education,  regional \nteacher  training  colleges  and  provincial  teacher  training  colleges,  taking  account  of  projected \nteacher requirements in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nSince  2001,  MOEYS  has  taken  steps  to  reduce  repetition  rates  in  primary  schools \nthrough  remedial  programs  during  vacations.  This  has  resulted  in  an  improvement  in  student \nprogression  rates  across  the  primary  grades.  Nevertheless,  repetition  rates  remained  high, \nresulting in significant costs for the Government and poor families.  For grade 1, the promotion \nrate  was  only  67%  compared  with  a  target  of  84%.  Repetition  rates,  on  the  other  hand,  are \nabove anticipated levels, particularly in grades 1 and 2. However, over the full grade 1\u20136 range, \nthe  trend  remains  encouraging,  with  improved  progression  rates  in  grades  3\u20136.  For  example, \nthe grade 3 progression rate has risen from 74% to 83% over the past 3 years. The continued \nsignificant level of repetition contributes to substantial dropout rates, especially for children from \nthe  poorest  families.  This  is  exacerbated  by  the  existence  of  incomplete  primary  schools, \nfrequently  located  in  the  poorest  communes.  Two  strategic  priorities  are  (i)  to  introduce  cost-\neffective remedial programs alongside monitoring of primary grade standards, and (ii) to phase \nout  incomplete  primary  schools  by  making  better  use  of  staff  and  facilities  and  selectively \nexpanding the number of classrooms.  \n \n13.  More  efficient  use  of  staff  and  facilities  in  2001/02  was  sustained  in  2002/03.  For \nexample,  average  pupil  teacher  ratios  (PTR)  have  remained  constant  at  57.  Class  sizes  have \nbeen  contained  at  45\u201346  pupils  per  class  by  maintaining  double  shifts  and  double-shift \nallowances for teachers. Double-shift primary schools have increased from 76% to 78.5% of the \ntotal in the past year, partly to accommodate the enrollment bulge from 2001/02 as it progresses \nthrough  the  system.  The  overall  pupil  class  ratios  (PCRs)  for  individual  grades  continue  to \nconverge at an increasing rate. Nevertheless, the proposed expansion of secondary education \nopportunities  will  necessitate  rigorous  guidelines  on  facilities  utilization,  possibly  incorporating \nphasing  in  of  basic  education  (grades  1\u20139)  schools  and  teachers.  This  strategy  would  allow \nflexibility  in  the  transition  between  the  leveling  out  of  primary  enrollment  and  lower  secondary \nexpansion.  \n \n14. \nOverall  enrollment  growth  has  provided  opportunities  for  other  medium-term  efficiency \ngains. The percentage of double-shift institutions is significant and rising (colleges, 35%, lycees, \n65%  in  2002/03).  In  lower  secondary  schools,  the  PTR  has  risen  from  19  in  2000/01  to  23  in \n2002/03,  while  the  overall  PCR  has  risen  from  41  to  47  over  the  same  period.  MOEYS \nrecognizes the need to achieve a balance between quality and efficiency improvement. In order \nto  provide  quality  assurance,  MOEYS  intends  to  contain  the  PCR  over  the  next  few  years  by \nconstructing  additional  facilities,  while  ensuring  a  sufficient  and  equitable  deployment  of \nexperienced and qualified teachers. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29 \n\nQuality Improvement Trends and Priorities \n\nEnrollment  growth  in  higher  education  and  TVET  has  resulted  in  marked  efficiency \n15. \ngains.  For  example,  in  higher  education  the  PTR  reached  20  in  public  institutions  and  14  in \nprivate institutions in 2002/03. In TVET, the PTR has increased to 13 in technical institutes and \nto  30  in  provincial  training  centers.  For  teacher  training  colleges,  the  PTR  is  about  16. \nNevertheless, further efficiency gains at these levels to accommodate increased demand are a \npriority, alongside rationalization of teaching and nonteaching staff levels.  \n \nD. \n \n16.  Monitoring quality improvement and education standards is problematic in the absence \nof  primary  school  and  student  performance  standards.  Surveys  conducted  as  part  of  the  ADB \nBasic Education Textbook Project and the World Bank Education Quality Improvement Project \nsuggest  that  some  factors  (e.g.,  textbook  availability  and  use)  have  been  associated  with \nimprovements  in  student  standards  in  mathematics  and  science  over  the  past  three  years.  A \nnumber  of  proxy  indicators  demonstrate  MOEY\u2019s  commitment  to  quality  improvement.  For \nexample, in 2002 MOEYS committed KR15 billion for instructional materials; a 7% increase on \nthe previous year. Additional textbooks distributed in schools maintain the one book per student \ntarget  (1:1  ratio)  in  primary  and  lower  secondary  schools.  Financial  allocations  for  sustaining \ntextbook orientation programs for teachers continued in 2004.  \n \nThe quality and efficiency of the teaching service continues to improve. The number of \n17. \ntrained  primary  school  teachers  has  increased  from  about  42,000  in  1999/00  to  47,000  in \n2002/03.  The  number  of  trained  secondary  school  teachers  has  increased  from  17,800  to \n22,700  over  the  same  period,  with  an  increased  share  of  the  teaching  force  having  upper \nsecondary  education  or  graduate  qualifications.  In  order  to  sustain  these  improvements,  the \nministry is increasing the allocation for teacher redeployment and the incentives program by 15\u2013\n20%  in  2003  compared  with  the  previous  year.  Teacher  development  program  allocations  will \nincrease  by  10%  in  2003,  with  more  emphasis  on  in-service  teacher  development  and  school \nmanagement  training.  For  example,  2,000  school  directors  were  scheduled  to  receive \nmanagement training in 2003, compared with 800 in 2002.  \n \n18.  MOEYS  is  taking  steps  to  address  the  inequitable  distribution  of  better-educated  staff, \nespecially  in  remote  areas.  A  large  proportion  of  the  teaching  staff  in  remote  schools  have \ncompleted only primary school. MOEYS will continue to expand teacher deployment incentives \nfor remote and disadvantaged areas (16,500 allowances were planned for 2003). In addition, for \n2002/03, over 1,500 teacher trainees (25% of total) were recruited from remote areas, with the \nunderstanding that they would be posted to these areas after training. \n \n19. \nDuring  2002,  MOEYS  allocated  a  total  of  KR31.5  billion  to  primary  and  secondary \nschools  for  the  procurement  of  basic  supplies,  teaching  materials  and  improvements  to  the \nschool environment. Current estimates are that over KR17.5 billion (55%) has been released to \nabout  6,500  schools,  amounting  to  roughly  KR2.7  million  (about  $673)  per  school.  About \nKR7 billion  has  been  provided  for  quality  improvement  measures  in  postsecondary  education \nand  nonformal  education.  It  is  anticipated  that  sustainable  operational  support,  alongside \nstrengthened institutional performance monitoring in 2003, will contribute to longer-term quality \nimprovement.  \n \n20. \nThere  are  significant  provincial  variations  in  pass  rates  of  grade  12  examinations,  with \nconsequent  constraints  on  the  long-term  supply  of  graduates  (including  school  teachers).  For \nexample, Phnom Penh is overrepresented in  the number  of students passing grade 12. While \nonly  28%  of  grade  12  exam  candidates  are  from  Phnom  Penh,  they  represent  over  50%  of \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nOverview of Reform Priorities, 2004\u201308 \n\nthose  who  pass.  The  challenge  to  MOEYS  is  to  raise  the  quality  of  secondary  education  in \nunderperforming provinces, e.g., Kampong Speu (12.7% pass rate) and Kep (2% pass rate). A \nstrategic  priority  is  to  ensure  a  sustained  supply  of  well-qualified  grade  12  students  in  each \nprovince  to  break  this  vicious  circle  of  reliance  on  four  or  five  provinces  to  supply  graduate \nteachers for secondary education. \n \nE. \n \nThe  joint  ESSP  review  2003  identified  a  number  of  key  reform  priorities  to  be \n21. \nimplemented  in  the  next  phase  of  the  reform  program  from  2004  to  2008.  These  include \n(i) progressing  towards  universal  primary  education  by  reducing  dropout  rates  and  overage \nprimary  school  entry;  (ii)  improving  primary  education  quality  through  curriculum  and  teacher \ndevelopment reform, targeted spending, introduction of standards monitoring and, in the longer \nterm,  increases  in  instructional  hours;  (iii)  conducting  a  phased  expansion  of  secondary \neducation  opportunities,  initially  for  lower  secondary  schools;  and  (iv)  rationalizing  and \nexpanding public, private and community partnerships in early childhood care and development, \nnonformal  education  and  literacy,  higher  education  and  selected  areas  of  TVET  and  skills \ntraining.  In  addition,  some  institutional  reforms  are  urgent,  including  education  governance \ninitiatives,  performance-based  teacher  remuneration  strategies  and  further  strengthening  of \ndecentralization strategies. \n \n22. \nA  second  set  of  priorities  is  the  urgent  expansion  of  skills  training  opportunities, \nespecially for unemployed youth in rural areas. For TVET, additional strategies will build on the \nlessons  learned  from  the  National  Training  Fund  support  of  the  growing  provincial  technical \ncenter  network.    For  higher  education,  strategies  will  take  account  of  the  strengths  and \nlimitations  of  the  growing  number  of  private  institutions,  including  quality  assurance  and \nregulatory issues.  Appropriate standards monitoring systems will be put in place. \n \nFor  TVET,  the  ESSP  review  recognizes  that  a key  objective  will  be  to rationalize  long-\n23. \nterm TVET policy and strategy, building on the initial TVET Strategic Plan prepared in 2001. The \nbroad purpose would be to help define options for the Government in financing and managing \nthe subsector. More specifically, alternative ways of ensuring strong regulation of the quality of \nboth public and private TVET providers and credit transfer between different levels of TVET will \nbe set out. For higher education, the ESSP review recognizes a key strategic objective will be to \nset current developments within a more comprehensive policy and governance framework. The \nbroad purpose would be to define clearly a policy framework for Government and private sector \nroles in higher education. More specific objectives of the study would include strategic options \nfor  higher  education  financing,  while  assuring  equitable  access  for  the  less  well-off.  Another \nobjective would be to examine the scope for progressive introduction of regional and provincial \nhigher  education \ntransfer  and  quality  assurance \nmechanisms. \n \n\nto  efficient  credit \n\ninstitutions, \n\nlinked \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\n \n1.

In  2003  the  range  and  capture  of  external  assistance  data  was \nextended.  The  information  presented  will  complement  the  MOEYS  analysis  of  trends  and \npatterns of external assistance in the context of the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) \nand the medium-term expenditure framework. The donor report 2002/03 outlines trends in donor \nfinancing  based  upon  detailed  financial  returns  provided  by  donors  covering  actual  financial \nassistance  to  the  sector  in  2002,  expected  assistance  in  the  current  year  and  projected \nassistance  over  the  next  four  years  to  2007.  All  donors  working  in  the  sector  were  asked  to \nprovide financial information, indicating for each project, program or discrete item of assistance \nthe financial method used and the level of assistance over the given period. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nTotal  external  funding  to  the  sector  for  the  period  2002\u20132007  is  estimated  at \n$282.5 million,  with  $44.5  million  actually  spent  in  2002,  $44.7  million  in  2003,  and \n$193.3 million  projected  for  2004\u201307.  Of  the  total  projected  financing  for  2002\u20132007,  42%  is \nexpected  to  come  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank.  Other \namounts  are  committed  by  the  United  Nations  agencies,  in  particular  the  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  UN  World  Food  Program  (UNWFP),  the  European  Commission, \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA). The remainder is contributed by a number of agencies. Summary \nfigures are provided in the table below. \n \n3. \nAlthough  annual  figures  for  the  medium  term  are  not  given,  it  is  assumed  that  roughly \nequal  amounts  will  be  provided  in  each  of  the  years  2004  to  2007.  It  is  apparent  that  overall \nassistance  to  the  sector  is  projected  to  increase  very  gradually  over  the  period  2002\u20132007. \nTaking  into  account  uncertainties  over  time,  it  is  likely  the  overall  level  of  funding  will  remain \nroughly  constant,  based  on  current  assumptions  for  new  medium-term  initiatives.  Despite  a \nforecast significant increase in assistance from 2001 to 2002, actual disbursements reported in \n2002 were significantly lower (by $10.6 million, or a decrease of 19%) than the level anticipated \nin the donor report for the 2002 review. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDonor \n\nADB \nAustralia \nBelgium \nUK DFID \nEC \nFrance \nFrench/AuF \nJapan \nSida \nUNESCO \nUNICEF \nUNWFP \nUSAID \nWB \n\nTotal \n\n2002  \nActual \nAmount \n14,211,000 \n2,040,747 \n0 \n0 \n1,336,465 \n2,500,000 \n570,000 \n5,513,572 \n0 \n484,000 \n6,436,746 \n3,883,480 \n108,000 \n7,474,444 \n44,558,454 \n\nTable A3.1: Total Education Sector Inputs by Donor \n($) \n\n2003 Amount \n\n2004\u201307 \nProjected \nAmount \n\nTotal Expenditure \n2002\u201307 \n\n9,315,000\n1,617,304\n500,000\n479,019\n5,177,500\n2,000,000\n911,287\n4,830,076\n0\n1,479,000\n6,549,778\n3,844,500\n500,000\n7,451,327\n44,694,741\n\n52,800,000\n4,047,186\n8,250,000\n4,311,174\n19,822,500\n8,000,000\n2,721,660\n18,808,000\n10,000,000\n3,298,000\n15,100,000\n12,840,000\n6,000,000\n27,273,243\n193,271,583\n\n76,326,000\n7,705,057\n8,750,000\n4,790,193\n26,336,465\n12,500,000\n4,202,397\n29,151,648\n10,000,000\n5,261,000\n28,086,524\n20,567,980\n6,608,000\n42,199,014\n282,484,278\n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank;  AuF  =  Agence  Universitaire  de  la  Francophonie;  DFID  =  Department  for \nInternational  Development  (United  Kingdom);  EC  =  European  Commission;  Sida  =  Swedish  International \nDevelopment  Agency;  UK  =  United  Kingdom;  UNESCO  =  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization; UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund; UNWFP = United Nations World Food Program; USAID = \nUnited States Agency for International Development; WB = World Bank.   \nSource: Education Sector Support Program, Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. \n \n4. \nIt  should  be  noted  that,  to  avoid  double  counting,  the  table  above  reflects  donors  and \nagencies  managing  external  assistance  (e.g.,  UNICEF  manages  significant  Sida  support  for \neducation, amounting to over $14 million). \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  donor  report  also  highlights  the  growing  diversity  of  methods  used  to  optimize \nimpact on various MOEYS education reform policies.

It  will  also  optimize  social  development  through  its  positive \nimpact  on  family  and  child  health,  HIV/AIDS  alleviation,  child  labor  and  trafficking  and  family  nutrition.  There  is  a \ncorrelation  between  poverty  profiles  and  family  well-being  measures  and  inequitable  access  to  primary  and \nsecondary  education  in  rural  areas  and  disadvantaged  communes.  The  Cambodia  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy  (NPRS)  identifies  more  equal  education  opportunities  as  a  key  enabling  factor  in  achieving  poverty  and \nsocial sector goals and targets of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. A better educated and trained labor \nforce  is  a  key  NPRS  objective.  Better  education  and  training  would  broaden  access  to  wage  opportunities,  enable \nrural  economic  diversification  and  rural  micro-business  development  as  part  of  broader  income  generation  in  both \npoor urban and rural communes.  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty analysis has been completed as part of ESDP II loan preparation, based on poverty\u2013education mapping by \nMOEYS. This analysis covered poverty and education indicators at national, provincial, district and commune levels \nfor: (i) education participation rates; (ii) availability of primary and secondary education facilities; (iii) internal efficiency \nmeasures;  (iv)  availability  of  experience  teachers;  and  (v)  education  resource  distribution,  including  both  recurrent \nand  capital  expenditures.  ESDP  II  incorporates  poverty-focused  systemic  and  targeted  interventions  based  on  this \npoverty  impact  analysis,  included  in  (i)  the  policy  measures  to  reduce  cost  barriers  to  access  for  the  poor  in  the \nESDP II program loan policy matrix, and (ii) targeted secondary school facilities development and commune-based \nskills training in the poorest 40% of communes and in remote and disadvantaged areas.   \n \n\nC.

It  is  estimated  that  about  800 \nadditional commune-based lower secondary schools will be needed over the next five years. \n \nThe ESP 2004\u201308 revision process also highlighted a number of key access and quality \n2. \nconstraints  on  science,  mathematics  and  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT) \neducation  development,  including:  (i)  inequitable  provision  of  high-quality  upper  secondary \neducation, making it difficult to generate potential undergraduates in all provinces; (ii) a lack of \nupper secondary education provision in some rural districts; and (iii) inequitable access to high-\nquality  science,  mathematics,  and  ICT  provision  in  upper  secondary  education,  resulting  in  a \nlimited supply of potential undergraduates from many provinces.   \n \n3. \nAnother  priority  is  the  establishment  of  provincial  personnel  management  and  staff \ndeployment committees to ensure that schools provided under the loan will be effectively staffed \nand managed. These committees will provide an annual staff deployment action plan for staffing \nnew  and  expanding  secondary  schools,  using  a  combination  of  staff  redeployment  and \nretraining of existing staff and posting of new staff.  \n \n4. \nThe  overall  strategy  is  to  ensure  equitable  access  to  lower  secondary  education  and \nimproved progression rates to the upper secondary level in order to create a virtuous circle that \nwill  enable  high-quality  upper  secondary  schools  in  all  24  provinces  to  generate  potential \nscience, mathematics, and ICT undergraduate students.  \n \n5. \nTo  achieve  this,  the  strategy  aims  to:  (i)  improve  efficiency  in  these  programs  by \nreducing  the  need  for  remedial  subject  upgrading  at  higher  levels;  (ii)  reduce  reliance  on \ngraduate  teachers  from  Phnom  Penh,  who  currently  fill  many  science,  mathematics  and  ICT \nteaching  posts  in  more  rural  and  remote  provinces;  and  (iii)  create  a  network  of  technical \nsupport and outreach at various levels of the system. \n \nB. \n \n6. \ncommunes in all 24 provinces where new school facilities will be provided: \n \n\nThe  following  criteria  will  guide  the  central  and  provincial  authorities  in  selecting  the \n\nSelection Criteria for Lower and Upper Secondary Schools Facilities Development \n\nthe absence of any school in the commune. \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\ncommunes with highest poverty incidence, including disadvantaged, remote and \npoorer  communes  in  rural  and  remote  areas  and  underserved  border  and \nreconciliation communes; \n\nprojected  high  grade  7\u20139  population  by  2008,  with  expressed  demand  for \nschools by communities; \n\navailability of vacant and idle land owned by the Government that is free from all \nencumbrances, habitation, dispute or controversy. The use of the land will neither \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nrequire a resettlement plan nor a resettlement framework and will be category C \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement (i.e. projects that do \nnot have foreseen involuntary resettlement effects); \n\nminimum required area as specified in the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport \nguidelines and standards, and located in an environment conducive to teaching \nand learning. The site should be at an elevation above the maximum anticipated \nflood level, or suitable for the construction of piles on which to build the facilities;  \n\ninterest  and \n\nin  schools  and  other \ndemonstrated  community \neducational institutions, including commitment to (a) organizing a representative \nschool\u2013community  governance  structure,  (b)  providing  for  on-going  facilities \nmaintenance,  (c)  actively  contributing  to  the  goal  of  100%  net  enrollment,  and \n(d) ensuring accommodation is available for teachers deployed in remote areas; \nand

This drafting process included wide \nconsultations with stakeholders, including direct public consultations.
