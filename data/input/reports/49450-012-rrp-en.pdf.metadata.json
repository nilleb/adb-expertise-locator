Upon approval, the \nBoard  delegated  authority  to  the  President  to  approve  loans  and/or  grants  to  each  targeted \ncountry for qualifying projects. \n \n2. \nThe  facility  will  finance  the  grants  to  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  for  the  Renewable  Energy \nProject (REP). The REP will help Tonga rapidly move from its heavy dependence on imported \nfossil  fuels  for  power  generation  (about  90%)  to  using  clean  and  renewable  energy  resources \nthat are low carbon and climate resilient. The REP will also provide technical solutions, such as \na  battery  energy  storage  system  (BESS),  and  capacity  building  for  promoting  more  private \nsector investments in renewables, which will help Tonga meet its 50% renewable energy target \nby  2020  and  70%  by  2030. 3  The  REP  will  also  increase  energy  access  of  marginalized \npopulations in the outer islands, where access is low and limited. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nRationale \n\nA. \n \n3. \nCountry  background.  Tonga  is  a  small  island  developing  state  consisting  of  177 \nislands with a total area of 748 square kilometers divided into the following four island groups: \nTongatapu,  Ha'apai,  Vava'u,  and  Niuas.  A  total  of  36  islands  in  Tonga  are  inhabited.  Tonga\u2019s \ntotal  population  is  estimated  at  103,000.4 About  75%  of  the  population  live  on  Tongatapu,  the \nmain island and the location of the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. The entire country is considered remote \nfrom most markets and resources, lying in the Pacific about 1,000 kilometers from Fiji and more \nthan 4,000 kilometers from New Zealand. \n \n4. \nClimate  change  vulnerability.  Like other small island developing states in the Pacific, \nTonga is highly vulnerable to external economic shocks and climate change. The country is also \nhighly  exposed  to  climate  and  geohazard  threats  such  as  cyclones  that  are  projected  to \nincrease  with  climate  change.  This  increases  investment  costs  of  electricity  infrastructure  and \nthe risks of private entities to invest in Tonga. \n \nWeak energy security. The peak demand of the four Tonga Power Limited (TPL)5 grids \n5. \nin 2018 was about 11.4 megawatts (MW), and annual consumption totaled about 57.9 gigawatt-\nhours. Peak demand and annual electricity consumption are expected to increase to about 12.8 \nMW and 66 gigawatt-hours by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly vulnerable to \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Pacific Renewable \n\n2  The  Cook  Islands,  the  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  Kiribati,  the  Marshall  Islands,  Nauru,  Palau,  Samoa, \n\nEnergy Investment Facility. Manila. \n\nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n\n3 Tonga  has  a  large  potential  for  renewable  energy,  notably  from  solar  and  wind.  Tonga\u2019s  Nationally  Determined \nContributions include the following generation targets: the share of all electricity generated from renewables will be \n(i) 50% by 2020 and (ii) 70% by 2030. \n\n4 Government of Tonga, Department of Statistics. 2016. Preliminary Census Data. Nuku'alofa. \n5 TPL is a vertically integrated government-owned public enterprise under the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the \ngovernment\u2019s  cabinet.  TPL  has  the  concession  for  and  operates  four  independent  grids  for  on-grid  electricity \nservices. These are on the main islands of Tongatapu, Vava\u2019u, Ha\u2019apai, and \u2018Eua island groups, where it generates, \ndistributes, and retails electricity, and provides operation and maintenance (O&M) services. \n\n\f2 \n\noil price shocks, which affect the affordability of food, goods, electricity, and transport. In 2018, \nTonga heavily depended on imported diesel to generate its electricity and consumed about 14 \nmillion liters of diesel to generate this electricity at a cost that was equivalent to about 10% of \nthe year\u2019s total gross domestic product and about 15% of the total value of imports. This led to \nlimited  electricity  consumption  because  of the  high  electricity tariff of  about  $0.36  per kilowatt-\nhour. \n \nLimited  electricity  access  in  outer  islands. 6  In  Tonga,  89%  of  households  have \n6. \naccess  to  electricity,  rising  to  97%  in  urban  areas.  However,  the  poor  who  live  in  the  outer \nislands,  such  as  the four  outer  islands  of  Ha\u2019apai  (i.e.,  O\u2019ua, Tungua,  Kotu,  and  Mo\u2019unga\u2019one) \nand  Niuafo'ou,  currently  access  the  electricity  generated  from  solar  home  systems  or \nhousehold-sized  fossil  fuel  generators  for  limited  periods  during  the  day.  Existing  solar  home \nsystems  are  mostly  in  varying  degrees  of  disrepair.  Limited  and  unreliable  electricity  access \nparticularly affects women by limiting their ability to carry out productive economic activity from \ntheir home, and decreasing safety and mobility at night.  \n \nTonga  Energy  Road  Map  and  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support.  To  address  the  multiple \n7. \nchallenges  of  climate  change,  energy  security,  and  energy  access,  the  Government  of  Tonga \nissued the Renewable Energy Act in 2008. A transition to renewable energy has been a national \npriority ever since. In 2009, the government issued the Tonga Energy Road Map, 2010\u20132020. 7 \nADB has supported three energy projects in Tonga since 2013. 8,   \n \n8. \nProposed  solutions.  The  REP  has  three  components:  (i)  a  large  BESS  capacity  on \nTongatapu to ensure that the intermittent electricity generated from solar photovoltaic and wind \npower  to  be  funded  by  private  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  can  be  stored  and  used \novernight  without  negatively  affecting  TPL\u2019s  grids;  (ii)  electricity  generation  from  the  most \nfeasible  renewable  resources  in  Tonga  in  \u2018Eua  and  Vava\u2019u  islands,  and  in  five  outer  islands \n(O\u2019ua, Tungua, Kotu, Mo\u2019unga\u2019one, and Niuafo\u2019ou); and (iii) grid technologies and management \nupgrade  to  adapt  to  new  electricity  sources  in  five  outer  islands.  The  project  also  includes \ncapacity building and project management support, with an emphasis on providing women with \ntraining  and  economic  empowerment  opportunities.  The  REP  will  help  Tonga  generate  more \nthan 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2020 and 70% by 2030.9 \n \n9. \nAlignment  of  development  plans.  The  project  supports  the  operational  priorities  of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii) \n\n                                                 \n6  The  Ministry  of  Meteorology,  Energy,  Information,  Disaster  Management,  Environment,  Climate  Change  and \nCommunications  is  primarily  responsible  for  policy  formulation  and  implementation  of  rural  electrification  and \ndemand management projects for off-grid (outer island) electricity services. \n\n7 Government of Tonga. 2010.

The  technical  feasibility  assessment \ndetermined that (i) mature technology and several experienced contracting firms exist for each \nof the subprojects; (ii) for outputs 2 and 3, solar resource (average global horizontal irradiance \nof  5.0 kilowatt-hours/square  meter/day)  are  suitable  for  the  selected  technology;  and  (iii) \ndesigns and sizing are sufficient to deliver the expected performance, and in the case of output \n3, to meet all estimated demand, including under adverse scenarios. \n \nFor output 1, the first unit (grid stability)17 of BESS is critical to achieving further progress \n20. \ntoward Tonga\u2019s renewable energy policy goals. This BESS provides substantial benefits through \nenabling  connection  of  new  intermittent  renewable  energy  (e.g.,  solar  photovoltaic  and  wind \npower)  generation  and  is  urgently  required.  The  second  (load-shifting)18 BESS  unit  provides \nadditional  benefits  by  utilizing  excess  energy  that  would  otherwise  be  spilt  and  is  especially \nimportant in achieving higher levels of renewable energy, including the ability to reach the 70% \nrenewable  energy  target  by  2030.  The  REP  will  be  the  first  project  in  Tonga  to  install  two \ndifferent forms of BESS in terms of functionality: (i) grid stability; and (ii) load-shifting.  \n \nFor outputs 2 and 3, substantial logistical issues will strongly influence the cost of these \n21. \noutputs  relative  to  international  benchmarks  and  will  likely  restrict  the  availability  of  capable \ncontractors who may bid to implement these outputs. That said, no significant issues have been \nidentified and methods are available to implement each of these outputs successfully. \n\n                                                 \n17 Measures typically start with a control system for managing the scheduling and operation of subsystems and power \nflows, and can add a range of technologies, such as high-power batteries, flywheels (synchronous converters and \ndiesel uninterruptible power supplies), and resistors and/or load banks, to reduce reliance on diesel generators. \n\n18 Load  shifting  is  where  energy  is  stored  for  relatively  long  periods,  for  use  when  generation  is  not  available. \nTypically, in the case of solar photovoltaic systems, this relates the daily cycle of charging during daylight hours and \ndischarging  overnight.  Many  grid  stabilization  systems  also  store  energy;  however,  these  may  store  energy  from \nmilliseconds to a few minutes, whereas load shifting is optimized for storing energy for several hours or even days. \n\n\f7 \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nTonga is highly exposed to climate and geohazard threats that are projected to increase \n22. \nwith climate change. This increases the level of risk associated with infrastructure investments \nand  costs.  To  address  this  risk,  the  selection  of  equipment  will  be  analyzed  based  on  best \nengineering  practices.  The  design  will  incorporate  adequate  climate  proofing  and  geohazard-\npreventive measures to lessen potential negative impacts of extreme weather events throughout \nthe  project  life  cycle.  For  instance,  the  BESS  installation  will  be  comprised  of  containerized \nBESS units (likely four 40-foot shipping containers), mounted on 1.5-meter high foundations to \nmitigate  any  risk  or  inundation  from  storm  surge  events.  All  components  procured  will  be \nsuitable for tropical marine and coastal environments, preferably preassembled and resistant to \ncorrosion, and able to withstand extreme weather events. Turnkey contractors will prepare the \nO&M manuals, which will include some climate proofing and geohazard-preventive measures. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe overall project can be considered financially viable, largely due to the high financial \nviability  of  the  BESS  component  on  Tongatapu  (output  1).  Each  of  the  solar  photovoltaic  and \nBESS  subprojects  on  \u2018Eua  and  Vava\u2019u  (output  2)  are  financially  unviable  on  a  stand-alone \nbasis, as the unit cost of solar is about three times higher than IPP generation on Tongatapu, \ngiven  (i)  smaller  scales  and  more  remote  sites;  and  (ii)  the  relatively  low  ratio  of  solar \nphotovoltaic to BESS capacity proposed, particularly on Vava\u2019u. The outer islands components \n(output 3) are likewise financially unviable because of (i) increased remoteness and (ii) the very \nhigh BESS capacity needed to supply electricity for at least 5 cloudy days (which is not required \nfor  the  other  islands  that  have  existing  diesel  generators).  However,  all  financially  unviable \ncomponents  are  financially  sustainable,  while  providing  clean  energy  access  to  vulnerable \ncommunities. For the \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u grids, large O&M cost savings from a partial switch from \ndiesel  to  solar  generation  supports  financial  sustainability.  For  the  outer  islands,  the  mini-grid \nhybrid systems can generate enough revenue from electricity sales to cover annual O&M costs. \nHowever,  the  MEIDECC  is  highly  dependent  on  funding  from  development  partners,  which \nposes  a  substantial  risk  to  the  financial  sustainability  of  output  3.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  tariff \nlevels will be set according to the formula in the PAM that ensures sufficient recovery of O&M \ncosts. \n \nThe  overall  project  can  be  considered  economically  viable.  Under  output  1,  the  BESS \n24. \ncomponent on Tongatapu yields a high economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 28.8%, above \nADB\u2019s  prescribed  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  for  investment  projects  of  9.0%.  For \noutput  2\u2014targeting  smaller,  rural,  and  more  vulnerable  populations  on  \u2018Eua  and  Vava\u2019u\u2014an \nEIRR of 8.7% is estimated, which is greater than the lower economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 6.0% applicable to these components.19 Results of a distribution analysis confirm that project \ninvestments on \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u could indirectly contribute to ongoing poverty alleviation efforts \nby the government. For output 3, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken, given the small \npopulations  in  five  outer  islands  (O\u2019ua,  Tungua,  Kotu,  Mo\u2019unga\u2019one,  and  Niuafo\u2019ou).  Results \nshow  that  the  use  of  solar  photovoltaic  systems for  hybrid  mini-grid  systems  is  the  most  cost-\neffective  option  for  providing  consistent  and  reliable  electricity  supply  in  these  outer  islands. \nFrom  a  basic  needs  or  basic  public  goods  and  services  provision  perspective,  non-delivery  of \nproject  outputs  will  adversely  affect  the  livelihoods  and  well-being  of  vulnerable  communities, \nparticularly in Tonga\u2019s outer islands that have limited access to reliable and affordable electricity. \n                                                 \n19 ADB.  2017.  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Manila.  These  guidelines  provide  justifications  for \napplying  a  lower  discount  rate  of  6%  as  the minimum  required  EIRR  for  social sector  projects, selected poverty-\ntargeting  projects  (e.g.,  rural  electrification),  and  projects  that  primarily  generate  environmental  benefits.  The \nproject contributes  to  reducing  carbon  emissions,  while  also  disproportionately  benefiting  Tonga\u2019s  disadvantaged \nouter islands populations that have limited access to reliable and affordable lifeline electricity services. \n\n\f8 \n\nGovernance \n\nC. \n \n25. \nFinancial management. The financial management capacity of TPL and the MEIDECC \nhas been assessed20 and found them to have the capacity and know-how needed to use grant \nfunds  for  their  intended  purposes.  Overall  risk  (encompassing  inherent  and  control  risks)  is \nmoderate  with  regard  to  TPL  and  the  MEIDECC.  The  main  risk  exposures  are  country  risks \nassociated  with  debt  distress  and  exposure  to  natural  disasters.  TPL\u2019s  external  auditor  has \nexpressed  unqualified  (clean)  opinions  for  all  financial  years.  Tonga  has  a  solid  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  that  sets  out  budgeting,  expenditure,  and  accountability  structures,  with \noversight by the Legislative Assembly. More detailed financial management, internal control and \nrisk  assessments,  and  the  financial  management  action  plan  are  presented  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 16). \n \n26. \nProcurement.  TPL  and  the  MEIDECC  will  carry  out  the  procurement  of goods,  works, \nand  related  services  under  the  REP.  The  project  management  consultant  (para  18)  will  assist \nthe two implementing agencies, which have extensive experience in procuring all project goods, \nworks,  and  services  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  consulting  services  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A procurement project risk assessment has \nbeen assessed. The key risks are found to be mitigated by the following procurement strategies: \n\uf0b7  The implementation agencies were identified as having insufficient qualified staff. Given \nthe complexity of having multiple implementing agencies, TPL and the MEIDECC have \nasked  ADB  to  handle  the  recruitment  of  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and \nPMU consultants under the project.  \n\n\uf0b7  Compliance with existing regulations was identified to be inconsistent. The appointment \nof  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and  PMU  to  monitor  the  delivery  of \nprocurement addresses this risk. \n\n\uf0b7  Risks around delayed payment processing will be mitigated through the engagement of \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nthe PMU and direct payments from ADB to contractors. \n \n27. \nAdvance  contracting  for  some  packages  using  an  international  competitive  bidding \nmethod  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time). The executing agency and the implementing agencies have been \nadvised  that  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  do  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government, the MFNP, the MEIDECC, and TPL. \n \nD. \n \nThe  beneficiaries  of  the  project  are  the  residents  of  Tonga  who  have  no  access  to \n28. \nelectricity,  especially  in  the  outer  islands.  The  REP  will  significantly  increase  electricity \ngeneration  reaching  those  without  electricity  supply.  The  poverty  assessment  shows  that \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  make  up  the  greatest  proportion  of  the  population  living  below \nthe  basic  need  poverty  line,  and  as  such  should  be prioritized  in the project  in  all  training  and \ncapacity-building activities. The primary beneficiaries of the outer island components (output 3) \nare  people  in  the  remote  outer  islands  of  Tonga  who  will  benefit  from  a  clean,  cheaper,  and \nreliable means of power supply. Primary beneficiaries will include low-income households with \nlimited access to electricity or those relying on existing lifeline electricity tariffs. Under the REP, \n\n                                                 \n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial \n\nDue Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n\n\f9 \n\nthe  people  of  the  four  Ha\u2019apai  outer  islands  and  Niuatoputapu  under  the  project  will  gain  a \nreliable electricity supply, which will result in more efficient electricity consumption and provide \nincentives to households and local businesses to maximize power supply for income-generating \nactivities.  Provision  of  social  services,  such  as  health  and  education,  is  expected  to  improve \nthrough the provision of a consistent power supply. \n \n29. \nThe  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  REP  will  directly  benefit \nwomen  in  Tonga,  particularly  in  the  five  outer  islands  (O\u2019ua,  Tungua,  Kotu,  Mo\u2019unga\u2019one,  and \nNiuafo\u2019ou).  The  provision  of  renewable  energy  will  increase  women\u2019s  access  to  cleaner, \ncheaper,  and  a  more  reliable  power  supply  that  will  support  income-generating  activities. \nMoreover,  reliable  electricity  will  improve  public  safety  especially  in  the  evening  for  women  to \nattend  social  gatherings.  The  project  also  addresses  the  limited  economic  participation  of \nwomen  in  Tonga  and  gender-based  wage  discrimination.  The  project\u2019s  key  actions  include  (i) \nincreasing  women\u2019s  labor force  participation rates  by  ensuring  that  women  are  involved  in  the \nproject,  including  in  nontraditional  construction  roles  that  are  likely  to  result  in  long-term \nemployment  opportunities;    (ii)  ensuring  equal  pay  for  equal  work;  (iii)  increasing  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in decision-making through their active participation in community electric societies; \n(iv)  developing  capacity  and  addressing  negative  social  norms  by  providing  training,  including \nbusiness  skills  training  with  men  and  women  at  each  project  site,  with  modules  on  intra-\nhousehold  decision-making,  and  the  sharing  of  household  labor  and  financial  access  and \ncontrol;  and  (v)  prioritizing  the  connection  of  households  headed  by  women  to  mini-grids, \nproviding  cheaper  energy  sooner,  and  maximizing  their  opportunities  to  benefit  from  income-\ngenerating activities that rely on a better power supply. \n \nE. \n \n30. \nInitial \nenvironmental  examinations  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  environment \npolicies  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant \nenvironmental impacts will result from the implementation of the REP. \n \n31. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared for the project facilitating the necessary acquisition of seven identified sites. The \nproject  is  expected  to  have  no  physical  displacement  or  relocation  of  people.  No  distinct  and \nvulnerable  indigenous  peoples  will  be  affected.  The  REP  will  be  implemented  in  a  culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF. \n \nNo significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project except the \n32. \nhigh  foreign  currency  exchange  risk  (Table  4).
