Following \nrapid  economic  growth  and  declining  poverty  in  the  early  1990s,  the  country  witnessed  a \nsudden deterioration of its gross domestic product (GDP) and heightened poverty in 1997\u20132000 \ndue  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  The  crisis  exposed  key  issues  related  to  the  lack  of \ncoordination  between  levels  of  government,  as  well  as  endemic  corruption.  Subsequently,  a \nstrong focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability and a conservative fiscal policy helped the \ncountry  gradually  overcome  some  of  the  economic,  political,  and  social  shocks.  Growth  has \nbeen moderate and poverty incidence has declined. \n \n3. \nIndonesia is now at a critical stage as recovery efforts must also aim to achieve annual \ngrowth rates of about 7% in order to create jobs needed to mitigate the unemployment rate of \n10.4%. To meet this target, much-needed reforms must continue to encourage greater private \nsector participation by improving the investment climate and developing a more responsive and \nsupportive finance sector. Moreover, the country needs to boost its development spending in a \nmanner that would support attainment of the Millennium Development Goals; progress has been \nmixed with many regions lagging.  \n \n4. \nEconomic Outlook and Challenges. Indonesia\u2019s economic growth accelerated to 6.3% \nin 2007, above its 5-year average of 5.5%\u2014the best growth rate since 1996. The main drivers \nof growth were private consumption, supported by private investment and an expansion of net \nexports. Year-on-year inflation declined from a peak of 18.4% in late 2005 to 6.6% at the end of \n2007, as the impact of a 126% rise in fuel prices in October 2005 faded. Amid some volatility, \ninflation averaged 6.4%\u2014within Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range of 5%\u20137%. While movements in \nfood  prices  and  seasonal  factors  contributed  much  to  the  volatility,  a  combination  of  factors \nranging  from  higher  global  nonfood  commodity  prices,  the  depreciating  rupiah,  and  a  steady \nincrease in domestic demand kept inflation from declining further.  \n \n5. \nPrivate sector credit growth quickened, reflecting a reduction in interest rates. With the \neasing of inflationary pressures, Bank Indonesia cut its policy rate from 12.75% in April 2006 to \n8.0% in December 2007. This led to a corresponding reduction in commercial bank rates and a \nrecovery  in  bank  credit,  which  increased  by  25.5%  year-on-year  in  December  2007.  The \nstronger growth in lending helped lift bank profits. Although GDP2 growth is forecast at 6.1% in \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Indonesia 2006\u20132009. Manila.   \n2  Indonesia\u2019s nominal GDP in 2006 was approximately $364 billion. \n\n \n\n\f 2 \n\n2008,  down  slightly  from  2007,  cheaper  borrowing  costs,  a  new  investment  law, 3  efforts  to \nencourage infrastructure investment, and various new guidelines introduced by Bank Indonesia \nto stimulate bank lending continue to create opportunities for growth. The main drivers in recent \ngrowth  are  private  consumption,  a  recovery  in  private  investment,  and  solid  expansion  of \nexports. The forecast slowdown is essentially the result of weakness in the global economy.  \n \n6. \nThe  strengthened  economic  fundamentals  and  yield  differentials  attracted  significant \nforeign portfolio inflows during the first half of 2007, before international investors turned more \nrisk averse after the subprime credit problems in the United States. After experienced a sharp \ndownturn during July\u2013August, the Jakarta Stock Exchange rebounded, and more than regained \nlost ground during the rest of the year. By the end of 2007, the exchange\u2019s composite index was \n52%  higher  than  a  year  earlier.  The  rupiah  depreciated  by  4.4%  against  the  dollar  in  2007, \ndespite  strong  growth  in  international  reserves.  This  growth  is  partly  attributed  to  reserve \nmanagement  arrangements,  whereby  inflows  of  foreign  exchange  from  oil  revenues  and \nroyalties  automatically  accumulate  as  Bank  Indonesia  reserves,  while  Pertamina  (the  state-\nowned oil company) buys dollars in the market to purchase oil imports. \n \n7. \nThe  relatively  moderate  impact  of  the  United  States  subprime  crisis  on  domestic \nfinancial  markets,  together  with  an  improved  policy  environment,  led  to  Standard  and  Poor\u2019s \n(S&P) raising the country\u2019s sovereign foreign currency debt rating to BB\u2013 and Moody\u2019s rating it \nBa3 in 2007. \n \n8. \nIndonesia\u2019s concerns  are  no  longer  dominated  by  economic  stabilization  and  recovery, \nbut  rather  of  achieving  and  sustaining  higher  growth  rates  to  reduce  unemployment,  poverty, \nand overall vulnerability. Complemented by a relatively young population, the country displays \nimmense  economic  potential  that  could  lead  to  higher  demand  for  consumer  spending  and \nbanking services. The Government of Indonesia is pursuing a progrowth agenda while pushing \nforward broad, structural, and institutional reforms. \n \n9. \nEconomic growth-related constraints include a narrow and shallow finance sector, poor \ninfrastructure,  and  an  adverse  investment  climate.  Deepening  of  the  finance  sector  is  a \nprerequisite  for  long-term  development  of  the  infrastructure  sector  and  sustained  growth.  The \nreliance of most businesses on direct bank lending limits investment possibilities and does not \nencourage  good  governance.  The  Government  recognizes  that  expansion  of  infrastructure  is \nrequired to increase service coverage, remove bottlenecks, and attract investments that would \nhelp achieve and sustain projected economic growth.  \n \nB. \n\nIndonesian Banking Subsector \n\n10. \nBanking  Subsector  Composition.  The  finance  sector  continues  to  be  dominated  by \nbanks,  which  in  2007  accounted  for  about  80%  of  the  sector\u2019s  assets.  The  country  has  129 \nbanks: 5 state-owned banks, 82 private commercial banks, 26 regional development banks, and \n16 joint venture banks. Despite a reduction in the number of banks from 222 banks in 1997, the \nbanking subsector is still overcrowded and fragmented. Many small banks are undercapitalized \nand  have  very  limited  businesses,  with  several  others  having  ceased  operation.  Twenty-four \nbanks  have  a  capital  base  of  less  than  Rp100  billion,  100  banks  have  from  Rp100  billion  to \n                                                 \n3   The new investment law released in March 2007\u2014UU Penanaman Modal 2007\u2014aims to reinvigorate investment \nin the Indonesian economy, create jobs, and reduce poverty. In the Indonesian Global Investment Forum in New \nYork, the President argued that the country needed to attract investors in order to create jobs and halve the poverty \nrate by 2009. He said Indonesia needed $426 billion of investments to make the 6.6% growth target possible each \nyear until 2009. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nRp10  trillion  in  capital,  and  only  5  banks  have  capital  greater  than  Rp10  trillion.  Indonesia\u2018s \nlargest  bank  is  only  the  eighth  largest  in  Southeast  Asia.  To  create  a  sound  and  efficient \nbanking  structure,  the  regulators  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  banks  by  imposing  a  higher \nminimum capital requirement. \n \n11. \nPolicies,  Regulations,  and  Strengthening  of  the  System.  Finance sector  regulation \nand  supervision  are  under  the  authority  of  two  main  supervisory  authorities.  Bank  Indonesia \nregulates  and  supervises  banks.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  it  received \nsignificant  strengthening  and  was  given  financial  autonomy.  The  1999  Central  Bank  Law  has \ntransformed  Bank  Indonesia  into  an  independent  central  bank  free  from  government \nintervention  or  any  other  parties.  The  law,  amended  in  2005,  proposes  to  establish  a \nconsolidated  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services  in  2010.  The  Capital  Markets \nSupervisory  Agency  (BAPEPAM)  regulates  and  supervises  the  capital  markets.  It  has  limited \npowers and reports to the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for high-level policy matters.  \n \n12. \nBank  Indonesia  is  seeking  to  promote  consolidation  and  strengthen  capitalization \nthrough a policy framework\u2014the Indonesian Banking Architecture. The framework includes new \ncapital tiers for banks that wish to operate internationally, nationally, or regionally. The new rule \nthat  imposes  a  minimum  capital  requirement  of  Rp100  billion  will  significantly  reduce  the \nnumber  of  banks.  Several  banks  have  already  merged  or  were  acquired  by  larger  institutions \nthis year. The framework also aims to improve regulatory standards based on international best \npractices  by  phasing  in  Basel  core  principles  of  effective  banking  supervision.  The  strict \nenforcement  of  prudential  rules,  the  need  for  internal  control  systems,  and  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s \npolicies are likely to strengthen banking.  \n \n13. \nIn  addition,  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  single  presence  policy,  which  will  be  effective  in  2010, \nlimits the controlling majority (25% ownership or indirect control) from having a controlling stake \nin  more  than  one  bank.  Those  with  multiple  stakes  will  need  to  divest,  establish  a  banking \nholding  company,  or  merge  their  bank  interests  in  Indonesia.  Under  the  Indonesian  Banking \nArchitecture,  the  regulators  aim  to  ultimately  reduce  the  number  of  banks  to  50\u201360  from  the \ncurrent base of 129.4  \n \nBanking  Performance.  The  overall  performance  of  banks  in  2007  was  positive, \n14. \nsupported  by  favorable  economic  conditions.  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  key  interest  rate  dropped  from \n12.75 % at the end of 2005 to 8.25% by the end of October 2007, but was raised in May 2008 to \n8.5%  to  ease  inflationary  pressure  from  the  27%  average  increase in  fuel  price.  In  May  2008, \nyear-on-year inflation was 10.3%. Although this rate is hoped to recede to approximately 7% by \nthe end of 2008, the impact of increasing fuel and food prices will prove challenging in curbing \ninflationary pressures.5 The lowering of the Bank Indonesia rate has led to a recovery in credit \ngrowth.  However,  as  a  reaction  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1997,  banks  are  more  risk \nadverse  in  lending  to  corporate  customers  and  more  inclined  to  keep  funding  in  Government \nbonds or consumer lending. Consumer loans account for 50% of all loans, while working capital \naccounts for 40% and term loans 10%.  \n \nAt  the  end  of  July  2007,  net  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  made  up  3.0%  of  the  banks\u2019 \n15. \nloan  portfolio  down  from  a  peak  of  48%  in  1998.  The  asset  quality  of  commercial  banks  has \nrecovered.  The  Government  recently  introduced  regulations  providing  more  flexibility  for  state \n\n                                                 \n4  Fitch. 2007. Indonesian Banks. Jakarta. \n5   Prices of rice, Indonesia\u2019s staple food, are reported to have increased approximately 26% from the first quarter of \n\n2007 to the first quarter of 2008. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nbanks to write off their bad debts, so the NPLs of state banks are expected to decline. Banks \nremain well capitalized, with a capital adequacy ratio of 20.5%, well above the prescribed norm \nof 8%. With respect to foreign currency, access for private enterprises was drastically reduced \nduring the Asian financial crisis. In particular, long-term funds in foreign exchange available for \nlending  decreased  and  have  not  yet  recovered.  Foreign  exchange  to  local  banks  from  the \ninternational  market  has  gradually  become  more  available  at  lower  and  more  competitive \ninterest rates; however, these funds are only suitable for short-term lending. \n \nPrivatization.  After  recapitalizing  and  restructuring  the  ailing  major  banks,  the \n16. \nGovernment  began  to  privatize  them  to  create  a  more  competitive  banking  landscape  and  to \nraise state revenues. The privatization aims to improve the performance and value of the banks; \nand to widen the investor base targeting institutional investors, portfolio managers, and existing \nowners  seeking  to  raise  their  stakes.  The  sale  of  the  Government\u2019s  stake  in  the  major  banks \nwas successful with international investors indicating strong interest. Fifteen banks representing \nmore than 70% of the country\u2019s bank assets have been privatized. The Government divested its \nstake  in  nine  private  banks  to  foreign  investors  as  controlling  shareholders.  Total  assets  of \nthese foreign-owned banks have reached 42% of the total industry assets.  \n \n17. \nThe Government has also started to partially privatize state-owned banks as part of an \neffort  to  sell  off  its  holdings  in  selected  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  The  Government \npartially  sold  its  stake  in  Mandiri  to  the  public  in  2003  and  2004.  As  a  listed  company,  the \nregulations  of  the  Capital  Market  Supervisory  Agency  require  greater  supervision,  transparent \nreporting,  nomination  of  independent  accountants,  and  establishment  of  an  audit  committee. \nThis  enhanced  supervision  combined  with  greater  assertiveness  of  public  shareholders  in \nexercising  their  rights  have  proven  to  be  quite  effective  in  making  Mandiri  more  transparent, \naccountable, and commercially operated.  \n \n18. \nIndonesian  banking \nsubsector  is  not  a  source  of  long-term  funding.  As  of  December  2005,  Indonesian  banks \ncontrolled  Rp1.47  trillion  in  assets  (more  than  50%  of  GDP).  However,  similar  to  the  banks  in \nmany  countries  in  the  region,  Indonesian  banks  obtain  most  of  their  funding  from  short-term \ndeposits.6  Accordingly,  Indonesian  banks  have  difficulty  offering  loans  that  match  the  life  of  a \nborrower\u2019s  investment  and  expenditure  requirements  without  taking  a  significant  asset\u2013liability \nmaturity mismatch.  \n \n19. \nfinance \ninfrastructure-related projects is substantial as many such projects generate dollar revenues. In \nthe  mid-1990s,  private  investment  commitments  in  any  given  year  averaged  30%\u201340%  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s development spending on infrastructure, or nearly 2% of GDP. In 2003 and 2004, \nprivate  investment  fell  to  less  than  25%  of  Government  spending,  or  just  0.4%  of  GDP.  The \nWorld Bank estimates that Indonesia needs to increase its lending to infrastructure by about 2% \nof GDP, or $5 billion per year, if the Government is to reach its 6% per year targeted medium-\nterm  economic  growth.  The  most  significant  bottleneck  to  meeting  the  investment  in \ninfrastructure required for sustainable economic growth is the inability of the Indonesian finance \nsector to access long-term financing. \n \n\nLong-Term  Financing.  Despite  recent \n\nIndonesian  market,  demand \n\nlong-tenor  dollar  borrowing \n\nimprovements, \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nIn \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n6  More than 80% of Mandiri\u2019s funding is by way of deposits of 1 month or less. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\nC. \n\nLoan Rationale \n\n20. \nGiven  the  significant  long-term  financing  requirement  in  Indonesia  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  other  capital  expenditure,  and  the  severe  limitations  of  the  local  financial \nmarket,  Mandiri\u2019s  role  as  the  country\u2019s  largest  financial  institution  continues  to  be  of  critical \nimportance.  Mandiri  has  undergone  significant  reform  of  its  finances  and  operations  since  its \nestablishment as a result of the Asian financial crisis. However, the ability of Mandiri to provide \nmuch  needed  long-term  funding  is  severely  constrained  by  Mandiri\u2019s  maturity  mismatch  in  its \nassets and liabilities, and the unavailability of long-term financing to address this mismatch. The \nlonger-tenor funding required is not available in the market without ADB support, and will greatly \nassist  in  improving  the  maturity  profile  of  Mandiri\u2019s  balance  sheet.  Further,  the  B  loan  will \nestablish  Mandiri\u2019s  relationship  with  international  commercial  banks,  thereby  fulfilling  the  vital \nrole of facilitating avenues for future fund raising.   \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\n21.  Mandiri  is  the  largest  bank  in  Indonesia  in  terms  of  total  assets,  loans,  and  deposits \n(based on financial statistics reported by Bank Indonesia as of 31 December 2007) and one of \nthe leading banking and financial services providers in Indonesia. Mandiri is majority-owned by \nthe  Government.  As  of  31  December  2007,  Mandiri  had  Rp319.1  trillion  in  total  assets,  \nRp125.5 trillion in total consolidated loans, and Rp253.8 trillion in consolidated total deposits.  \n \n22.  Mandiri was established in October 1998, and following the merger in July 1999 with four \nstate-owned banks\u2014Bank Bumi Daya (Persero), Bank Dagang Negara (Persero), Bank Ekspor \nImpor  Indonesia  (Persero),  and  Bank  Pembangunan  Indonesia  (Persero)\u2014it  commenced \noperations in August 1999. \n \n23.  Mandiri  completed  its  initial  public  offering  in  July  2003.  The  Government  followed  this \nby  divesting  20%  of  its  shares  in  Mandiri.  Mandiri  is  currently  listed  on  the  Jakarta  Stock \nExchange  and  Surabaya  Stock  Exchange.  In  March  2004,  the  Government  divested  an \nadditional 10% of its shares in Mandiri through a secondary offering.   \n \n24.  Mandiri  has  14  subsidiaries.  The  Mandiri  Group\u2019s  principal  activities  include  providing \ngeneral banking services including activities based on sharia principles. The group carries out \ncommercial  banking,  corporate  banking,  consumer  banking,  and  treasury  activities.  One  of  its \nsubsidiaries,  Mandiri  Sekuritas,  is  the  largest  and  best-capitalized  investment  bank  and \nsecurities  firm  in  Indonesia.  The  subsidiaries  are  an  amalgamation  of  companies  originally \nowned by the four merged banks. Mandiri continues to evaluate subsidiaries\u2019 activities with the \nintention of divesting those that do not fit with its main business lines in corporate, retail, sharia, \nand investment banking.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE  \n\nA. \n\nProposed Investment \n\n25. \nThe proposed loan to Mandiri is for up to $75,000,000 without a government guarantee \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. It will have a term of up to 7 years and other such terms \nand conditions set forth in this report.  \n \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nThe proposed long-term dollar financing will assist Mandiri in two core areas. It will assist \n26. \nin  improving  the  funding  structure  problems  currently  stemming  from  the  large  asset\u2013liability \nmaturity mismatch. In addition, it will enable Mandiri to support and expand its long-term dollar \nloan  portfolio,  which  consists  primarily  of  customers  seeking  financing  to  invest  in  long-term \nprojects, such as infrastructure-related activities.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Issues  \n\nThe  investment  is  classified  FI  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  ADB  has \n27. \nadvised  Mandiri  on  its  safeguard  policies,  and  discussed  their  relevance  and  importance. \nMandiri  will  be  required  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  as  applicable  to  FI  and \nnonsovereign  operations.  Mandiri  will  be  required  to  adopt  an  appropriate  environmental  and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  and  build  capacity  in  environmental  and  social  impact \nassessment and management where appropriate.  \n  \n28. \nAs  a  corporate  loan,  the  investment  does  not  involve  any  identified  projects  requiring \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples.  It  is \ntherefore assigned category C with regard to The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) \nand the policy relating to Involuntary Resettlement (1995). \n \nC. \nand the Financing of Terrorism  \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Policy Relating to the Combating of Money Laundering \n\n29.  Mandiri  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire Mandiri to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  Mandiri  will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS \n\n1. \n\nObjectives and Outcome \n\nThe loan merits ADB support for the following reasons: \n\n30. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  loan  provides  support  to  Mandiri  as  it  continues  to  strengthen  its  financial \nposition  and  undertake  further  financial  reform.  The  loan  will  assist  Mandiri  to \naddress  the  severe  asset\u2013liability  mismatch  that  dominates  Mandiri\u2019s  balance \nsheet and exposes Mandiri to significant liquidity risk. Financial institutions such \nas Mandiri will play a critical role in strengthening Indonesia\u2019s finance sector and \nin providing much needed long-term funding in Indonesia. \nThe  loan  will  improve  Mandiri\u2019s  ability  to  lend  long-term  foreign  currency  to \nborrowers  involved  in  various  long-term  projects  across  Indonesia  and  enable \nbetter  matching  of  cash  flows,  thus  stabilizing  economics  for  the  end  borrower. \nLong-tenor funding is required to help Indonesia meet infrastructure development \nrequirements essential for sustained economic growth.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  loan  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation in capital investment, given the large financial outlays required and \nlimited public sector financing available.  \nThrough  the  loan,  ADB  will  guide  the  development  and  institutionalization  of \nMandiri\u2019s  ESMS  to  ensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies in its transactions.  \nThe loan is likely to catalyze commercial bank participation. Long-term debt has \nalready been verbally committed by reputable international banks under ADB\u2019s B \nloan  program.  This  is  likely  to  facilitate  Mandiri\u2019s  access  to  longer-term  funding \nfrom similar institutions.  \nADB  assistance  to  Mandiri  will  be  the  first  from  a  multilateral  development \nagency  without  sovereign  guarantee,  and  will  be  viewed  by  the  market  as \nsupporting Mandiri as it undertakes reform measures. These reforms are in line \nwith the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to restructure state-owned banks and with \nBank Indonesia\u2019s program to strengthen banking in Indonesia. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact and Effectiveness \n\nfinancial \n\n31. \nThe  development  impact  assessment  of  a  financial  intermediary,  including  Mandiri, \nbegins by acknowledging the well-established thesis that a healthy finance sector, populated by \ninstitutions,  promotes  sustainable  economic  growth,  helps  generate \nhealthy \nemployment, and ultimately reduces poverty. Therefore, the ability of a financial intermediary, in \nthis  case  Mandiri,  to  positively  impact  development  depends  on  various  indicators  of  its \nstrength, through both qualitative and quantitative measures, as well as broader impact beyond \nMandiri itself.  \n \n32. \nDevelopment  indicators  can  be  categorized  along  two  key  parameters  within  the \nproject\u2019s impact  on  private  sector  development  via  (i)  project  (direct)  company  impact  that  the \nproject  delivers  to  and/or  by  Mandiri;  and  (ii)  beyond  (indirect)  company  impact  to  the  wider \nsector and/or economy outside the specific activities of Mandiri.  \n  \n\n3. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy \n\n33. \nDue to budgetary constraints, the Government has had difficulty providing the required \ninfrastructure investment from its own funds. It has therefore launched an infrastructure reform \nprogram supported by ADB and other development partners to regain the confidence of private \nsector investors, and to mobilize their resources to fill the gap resulting from the sharp decline in \ninfrastructure  investment.  The  assistance  to  Mandiri  will  help  provide  the  funding  needed  to \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  efforts.  The  Government  continues  to  undertake  regulatory, \nstructural, and policy changes in an effort to prepare sector ministries, local governments, and \nSOEs for greater private sector involvement in infrastructure. \n \n34. \nconstraints on development. The expected outcomes include \n \n\nADB will engage the Government in five areas of operations derived from the analysis of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nimproved infrastructure and infrastructure services, including rural infrastructure, \nwith  increased  public  and  private  sector  investment  and  improved  sector \nregulation as indicators; \ndeepened  finance  sector  with  improved  domestic  resource  mobilization  to  meet \nlong-term financing needs as the indicator; \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimproved  decentralization  with  increased  regional  spending  and  enhanced \nfinancial reporting as indicators; \naccelerated Millennium Development Goal achievement with better water supply \nand sanitation, health, and education indicators; and \nstrengthened  environment  and  natural  resource  management  with  enhanced \nwater and marine resource management and reduced pollution as indicators. \n\n \n35. \nAreas (i) and (ii) are expected to help leverage much greater private sector participation. \nEngagement  will  be  selective,  and  reflect  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  recently  approved  long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)7 as well as those of the Government. \n \n36. \nTo  support  the  Government\u2019s  goal  and  drawing  on  lessons,  ADB  intends  to  focus  on  \n(i)  development  of  infrastructure,  (ii)  promotion  of  decentralization,  (iii)  reduction  of  regional \ndisparities,  (iv)  enhancement  of  natural  resource  management,  and  (v)  reform  of  the  finance \nsector. 8   Given  the  core  objectives  to  develop  infrastructure,  promote  decentralization,  and \nreform  the  finance  sector,  the  proposed  investment  in  Mandiri  is  directly  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia and Strategy 2020.  \n \nThe  proposal  supports  the  Capital  Market  Development  Program  Cluster 9   aimed  at \n37. \nincreasing  the  contribution  of  the  finance  sector  to  economic  growth  and  development.  It  also \nsupplements  the  loans  and  grants  under  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram 10  to  help  improve  Indonesia\u2019s  investment  climate  and  tap  the  power  of  the  private \nsector in meeting the country\u2019s huge infrastructure needs. \n \n\n4. \n\nSOE Lending under the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative   \n\n38. \nAs outlined in ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and \nModalities,11  many  SOEs  are  creditworthy  and  have  the  long-term  financial  viability  to  borrow \nwithout government guarantees. They constitute a third generation12 of potential borrowers, and \nare  increasingly  important  as  they  operate  rather  independently  from  the  sovereign.  These \nentities  play  an  important  role  in  creating  employment,  and  providing  infrastructure  and  basic \nservices.  Giving  them  access  to  affordable  long-term  credit  is  critical  to  promoting  economic \ngrowth. In addition to providing Mandiri with a much-needed source of long-term funding, ADB\u2019s \nobjective  in  this  transaction  is  to  lend  and  facilitate  cofinancing,  in  each  case  without \ngovernment  guarantee,  to  ensure  that  Mandiri\u2019s  asset\u2013liability  gap  and  corresponding  liquidity \nrisk  can  be  reduced,  while  enabling  longer-tenor  financing  to  be  available  to  borrowers  in  the \nIndonesian market. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2008.

Examples of such reforms are the creation of \na sound financial base and specific undertakings for financial management, environmental and \nsocial  safeguards,  matters  regarding  operations,  and  ownership.  Mandiri  has  already \nimplemented  various  financial  reform  measures  to  strengthen  its  financial  position,  including \nresolving  NPLs,  reducing  operating  costs,  and  improving  its  business  strategy.  As  part  of  this \nreform process, it is seeking to strengthen its balance sheet, thereby improving its financial risk \nprofile.  The  ADB  assistance  would  assist  in  addressing  Mandiri\u2019s  current  maturity  mismatch, \nand consequently strengthen its financial base. This will greatly contribute to Mandiri\u2019s financial \nreform. \n \n40.  Mandiri  has  undertaken  numerous  corporate  governance \nimprove \nperformance, transparency, and efficiency. These reforms are in line with Government efforts to \nimprove  the  management  and  operations  of  SOEs,  which  have  been  supported  by  ADB.13  Its \nwork in this area has been publicly noted, and in light of the numerous governance awards won \nin  recent  years,  is  currently  seen  as  a  governance  model  for  other  financial  institutions  and \nSOEs in Indonesia. Mandiri has made clear progress in the area of operations reform, and on \nthe  basis  of  its  financial  standing  and  the  nature  and  depth  of  specific  undertakings,  merits \naccess to financing in accordance with the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative. \n \n \n\nreforms \n\nto \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n41. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nIndonesian  Government  will  be  requested  to  confirm  that  it  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed \nfinancial  assistance  to  Mandiri.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \n42. \nfollowing approval of the proposed financing by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors.  \n \n \n\nADB  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  documentation  and  other  required  legal  documents, \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n43. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove: \n \n\nthe  loan  of  up  to  $75,000,000  to  Bank  Mandiri  (Persero)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with procedures \napplicable to ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations and as approved by ADB\u2019s Pricing \nand  Credit  Enhancement  Committee,  a  term  of  up  to  7  years,  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board; and \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB.  2001.
