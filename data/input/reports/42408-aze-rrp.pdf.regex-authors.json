An  environmental  assessment  and \nreview framework has been prepared to guide environmental \nassessment of projects during implementation. \n \nInvestment Program  The  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the \nDescription  Investment Program) will improve the quality and coverage of \nurban  services  in  secondary  towns  and  peri-urban  areas \nsurrounding  Baku.  It  will  benefit  approximately  500,000 \nresidents.  \n \nThe Investment Program has three components: (i) constructing \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  (WSS)  infrastructure  to  boost \nservice  coverage,  quality,  and  reliability  (Component  A);  (ii) \ndeveloping  institutional  effectiveness,  including  management \nand  governance  (Component  B);  and  (iii)  instituting  program \nmanagement facilities to oversee program implementation and \ntreatment  of  technical  requirements  such  as  those  for \nenvironment and social safeguards and gender mainstreaming \n(Component C).  \n \nPhysical  investments  from  component  A  will  provide  (i) \nincreased water supply coverage; more connections to piped \nnetworks; and reduced system leaks to ensure 24-hour supply of \npressurized, safe drinking water; and (ii) increased wastewater \ndisposal  and  treatment.  Components  B  and  C  will  finance \nnonphysical investments targeting (i) institutional improvements \nfor WSS service delivery; (ii) capacity development for better \nsystem  planning,  operation,  and  maintenance;  (iii)  enhanced \ncost recovery through metering, billing, and collection tariffs; (iv) \nincreased  efficiency  for  timely  processing  of  effective  WSS \nprojects; and (v) a twinning arrangement with an external WSS \nutility  to  support  capacity  development.  Component  C  will \ninclude  project  management  support;  assistance  to  carry  out \ndue diligence for new tranches; help with gender, environment \nand  social  safeguards,  governance,  legal,  financial,  and ", "ii   \nadministrative matters; design works for subsequent tranches; \nand general training and development.  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The  Government  of  Azerbaijan  requested  that  the  Asian \nFacility   Development Bank (ADB) extend financing for the Investment \nProgram  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  The \nMFF modality\u2014up to $600 million\u2014is justified, because  \n(i)  it establishes the foundation for an 8-year partnership \nbetween ADB and the Government of Azerbaijan,  \n(ii)  it combines interrelated physical and nonphysical \ninvestments, \n(iii)  it allows for investments to be phased, and  \n(iv)  it is backed by a clear strategy and policy framework \nand underpins a sound investment program. \n \nA stand-alone project would lead to higher transaction costs and \ndeny the chance to establish a long-term partnership. A sector \nloan  approach  would  be  less  efficient  than  an  MFF,  as  the \nInvestment Program has relatively large investments that are \nless suitable for sector loan lending. A program loan modality \nwould only focus on reforms.  \n   \nRationale  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the quality and \nefficiency of water service delivery declined in Azerbaijan, due to \npoor  management  and  inadequate  investments.  The  existing \nWSS system is over 50 years old. Water supply sources are in a \npoor state of repair, and other modes of supply (e.g., through \nprivate  vendors)  are  expensive  and/or  unreliable.  Water \ntreatment  facilities  in  secondary  and  small  towns  are  either \nabsent or largely dysfunctional. Despite an 83% piped-network \ncoverage rate in these towns, the majority of residents do not \nhave access to safe drinking water. The sewage system is in \neven worse condition. Pipes are broken or clogged with silt \nand debris, and wastewater is discharged into ditches or the \nnearest  watercourses.  Poor  sanitation  and  leaking  sewers \ncreate serious health risks and environmental hazards. \n \nInsufficient and unreliable infrastructure and services are adding \nto  household  costs  and  are  diminishing  the  quality  of  life  in \nsecondary  towns.  An  intensive  program  of  reforms  and \norganizational  development  targeting  service  delivery  bodies, \ncoupled with long-term capacity programs and investments, is \nnow needed to meet the targets under the state program on \npoverty reduction and sustainable development for 2008\u20132015. \nThese actions are also needed to ensure 24-hour water supply \nand 80%\u201385% coverage in secondary towns. ", "  iii\n    \nA set of sequenced reform actions and sector investments will \nbring improvements in service delivery. The Investment Program \nresponds to these needs by adopting a long-term and holistic \napproach in improving institutions, capacities and systems, and \nservice delivery.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  public  health  and \nenvironment in areas having about 500,000 residents total. The \noutcome of the Investment Program will be improved coverage, \nand  continuity  and  quality  of  water  supplies  and  wastewater \ndisposal. Outputs include (i) physical expansion of the system; \n(ii) greater institutional efficiencies and management; and (iii) \nbetter planning, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and treatment \nof priority themes.  \n   \nInvestment Program   The Investment Program is estimated at $800 million, of which \nCost Estimates   up to $600 million will be covered under the MFF. Infrastructure \nfinancing under the urban sector road map is estimated at $2.3 \nbillion for 2009\u20132017. \n   \n  Investment Program, 2009\u20132017 \n($ million) \n \nSector \nInvestment  Investment \nInvestment Program Component  Plan  Program \nA.

The project management offices (PMOs) \ncreated  at  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  will  be  responsible  for \nsupporting  project  implementation.  Each  PMO  will  comprise \ninternational and national consultants (to be engaged through \nfirms or directly as individuals) and counterpart staff.

The \nPMOs  will  also  provide  hands-on  training  to  staff  members \nduring each stage of the program implementation.  \n \nA program steering committee, which will meet at least once \nevery  3  months,  will  provide  general  policy  and  strategic \noversight,  resolve  interagency  problems,  and  oversee  the \noverall  implementation  of  subprojects.  It  will  also  decide  on \nfuture  PFRs  and  assess  the  results  framework  for  the \nInvestment Program.

The investments will (i) raise the \nquality of the management and operational teams; (ii) increase \ncost recovery and service revenues; (iii) raise awareness and \nmake explicit the links among infrastructure investment, service \ndelivery performance, and user charges; (iv) improve financial \nplanning,  budgeting,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (v)  increase \ncustomer  orientation;  and  (vi)  improve  outsourcing  and \nintroduction  of  performance-based  management  contracts \nfollowing  the  completion  of  physical  works.  By  2017,  six \nparticipating  secondary  towns  and  several  peri-urban \nsettlements  surrounding  Baku  will  benefit  from  the  improved \nWSS  services.  Improvements  in  the  water  quality  and \ncontinuity\u2014and wastewater disposal and treatment\u2014will lead to \npublic  health  improvements  and  consequent  reductions  in \nwaterborne diseases and medical treatment costs.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Water Supply and \nSanitation  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframeworks for the MFF and the first tranche are in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.   In its state program on poverty reduction and sustainable development for 2006\u20132015,1 \nthe Government of Azerbaijan committed to improving access to basic services. Considering the \nimportance of safe drinking water supply and sanitation (WSS), the state program is targeting \nimproved  WSS  coverage  and  service  quality  by  2015.  This  includes  100%  coverage  with \n24-hour water supply in Baku and 80%\u201385% coverage in secondary towns and villages.  \n \n3.   Given the magnitude of WSS investment requirements and the scale of related policy \nreforms, the Government recognizes that improving WSS services in secondary towns requires \nsequenced  interventions  linked  with  reforms.  The  Government  requested  that  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) help finance part of its overall investment program.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Economic, Demographic, and Poverty Profile \n4.  Azerbaijan's  economy  declined  immediately  after  its  independence  from  the  Soviet \nUnion in 1991. By 1995, its gross domestic product (GDP) had dropped by about 63% from its \npre-independence level. However, due to development of its oil industry, the GDP grew steadily \nbetween 2000 and 2008 by about 10% annually, and the share of oil and gas production of the \nGDP increased from about 27% in 2000 to about 52% in 2008. While non-oil outputs also grew \nat about 10% annually, the non-oil sector\u2019s share of GDP has remained relatively low. The \nGovernment has recognized that improving infrastructure sectors, including WSS, is as critical \nfor expanding the non-oil sector as it is for improving living standards among its population.  \n \n5.  Of Azerbaijan's 8.2 million people, about 52% live in urban areas. The average annual \npopulation growth rate for both urban and rural areas has remained steady at about 0.7% since \n2001. Baku, the capital and largest city, has a population of about 2.1 million, followed by Ganja \n(310,000) and Sumgayit (270,000). There are also 11 major cities with populations above \n50,000 and 28 secondary towns with 20,000\u201350,000 people. \n \n6.  Poverty levels have declined from an estimated 49.0% of the country\u2019s population in \n2001  to  about  13.2%  in  2009.  Although  Baku  has  the  greatest  number  of  poor  people, \nsecondary towns have higher incidences of poverty. Furthermore, rural areas and small towns \nsuffer from unreliable supplies of energy, water, and gas, and they often lack access to basic \neducation and health services.  \n2.  Water Supply and Sanitation Services in Secondary Towns \n7.  The WSS sector in Azerbaijan has weak institutions, inefficient operations, outdated and \n                                                 \n1  Government  of  Azerbaijan.  2008.  State  Program  on  Poverty  Reduction  and  Sustainable  Development  for  \n2006\u20132015. Baku. ", "2 \ndilapidated physical infrastructure, and severe financial constraints. As a result, consumers \nreceive poor quality WSS services. Existing WSS services have especially impaired the poor as \n(i) they spend more time collecting mostly unsafe water; and (ii) they must obtain smaller \nquantities of water from vendors, often paying 10 times above what high-income households \npay.  \n8.  Until 2004, the WSS sector comprised (i) Greater Baku and the Apsheron peninsula, \nserved by the joint stock company (JSC) Apsheron Regional Water Company; and (ii) all urban \nand  rural  communities  outside  the  Apsheron  peninsula,  served  by  the  Azersukanaltemir \nProduction Union (AzerSuKanal), a department within the State Committee for Construction and \nArchitecture. In June 2004, Presidential Decree No. 252 liquidated AzerSuKanal and transferred \nits  functions  and  assets  to  JSC  Azersu  (AZERSU),  formerly  Apsheron  Regional  Water \nCompany, for improving WSS management. \n9.  AzerSuKanal had 51 local branches or water and wastewater enterprises, known as \nSuKanals, to provide WSS services in provincial towns and other residential areas. Under \nPresidential Decree No. 252, AZERSU now manages all SuKanals and JSCs,2 coordinates their \nactivities, and prepares proposals on implementing state policy to improve WSS systems. The \nexception  is  in  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic,  where  WSS  is  overseen  by  the  State \nAmelioration and Water Management Agency (SAWMA). \n \n10.  The  current  institutional  setup  is  complex,  as  several  institutions  have  overlapping \noversight  functions.  They  include  (i)  the  State  Property  Company  under  the  cabinet  of \nministers,  which  holds  AZERSU\u2019s  shares;  (ii)  the  Tariff  Council,  which  regulates  sector \neconomics and pricing; and (iii) the Ministry of Health, which is responsible for monitoring water \nquality. Consequently, overall sector performance is not well monitored or documented. The \nsector needs a leading policy oversight body with sufficient authority to monitor performance, to \nensure that funds provided to AZERSU and SAWMA are well spent, and to improve service \ndelivery.3 \n \n11.  SuKanals  and  JSCs  have  limited  institutional  capacity.  They  are  predominantly  \nengineering-focused,  with  insufficient  attention  to  system  operation  and  infrastructure \nmaintenance. They lack efficient operational planning, financial management, and commercial \nperformance.  Comprehensive  reforms  are  necessary  in  their  institutional  structures, \nmanagement, staff composition, and skills mix for them to function as full-pledged WSS utilities.  \n \n12.   Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the quality and efficiency of water service \ndelivery declined due to poor management and inadequate investments. Now, the WSS system \nis over 50 years old and in a poor state of repair. Other modes of supply (e.g., through private \nvendors) are expensive and/or unreliable. Water treatment facilities in many secondary towns \nare  either  absent  or  dysfunctional,  and  distribution  networks  are  inappropriately  sized  and \ndilapidated.  Despite an 83% piped-network coverage rate in secondary towns, the majority of \nresidents  do  not  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Unaccounted-for  water  is  difficult  to \nestimate, because there have been no realistic assessments due to the absence of water \nmeters.  Moreover,  engineering  drawings  of  the  distribution  systems  are  rare,  which  make \nmaintenance and repairs difficult. Service levels vary from town to town. The latest municipal \n                                                 \n2  In Agdash, Ganja, Goychay, and Sheki, WSS operations are currently being carried out under separate JSCs\u2014the \nsubsidiary companies of AZERSU formed under projects financed by ADB and German development cooperation \nthrough KfW. \n \n ", "3 \nservices survey4 carried out across the country in 2003 revealed that at least 81% of urban \nhouseholds and over 90% of the households in major cities had house water connections. In \nsmaller secondary towns, more than 75% of households relied on wells and private water \nvendors. \n \n13.   The sewage system is in even worse condition. Only 55% of Azerbaijan\u2019s population \nhas access to sanitation facilities. Access in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, with \ncoverage estimated at 73% and 36%, respectively.5 The sewage network in Baku serves about \n78% of the city's population.6 Sewage coverage in other urban areas is about 32%. Pipes are \nbroken or clogged with silt and debris, and wastewater is discharged into ditches or the nearest \nwatercourses.  Poor  sanitation  and  leaking  sewers  are  creating  serious  health  risks  and \nenvironmental hazards.  \n \n14.  Water supply in Azerbaijan is intermittent, of limited quantity, and of poor quality with \nhigh levels of silt. Many consumers buy water from private vendors to augment their supply. \nDuring heavy rains, raw sewage floods streets and house compounds, and existing treatment \nfacilities  do  not  operate.  River  pollution  increases,  and stagnant sewage  threatens  health \nconditions. Data on drinking water quality in Azerbaijan are scant due to inadequate monitoring \nand record-keeping practices at the SuKanal and JSC level. While some reports indicate that \nwaterborne diseases (e.g., bacterial dysentery, parasitic infections, viral hepatitis, and typhoid) \nwere widespread during the 1990s, official health statistics indicate that their incidence is \ndeclining. \n \n15.   Furthermore,  the  current  financial  performance  of  SuKanals  and  JSCs  is  poor. \nAlthough SuKanals and JSCs are self-financing agencies in principle, they are unable to fully \nrecover tariffs directly due to the poor condition of infrastructure and related services. For \nnonroutine repairs, SuKanals and JSCs rely on additional funds from AZERSU, which are not \nalways forthcoming. Additionally, operating revenues from tariffs are inadequate for proper \noperation and maintenance, which has led to the continued deterioration of WSS systems. \nBilling and recording of outstanding amounts are not properly managed, and customers resist \npaying water bills due to poor service. The current method of door-to-door payment collection \nalso compromises the ability to monitor payment. The absence of residential and bulk water \nmetering not only makes it impossible to measure consumption and to establish suitable tariffs, \nbut also reduces incentives for demand management.  \n  \n16.  Unsurprisingly, AZERSU is currently saddled with a huge backlog of arrears inherited \nupon  its  establishment  in  2004.  Both  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  have  not  been  generating \nsufficient revenues to cover operation and maintenance costs and depreciation, rendering them \nunable to expand systems and to improve service quality.  \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n17.  Fiscal Constraints. WSS services will continue to deteriorate without further investment \nin  their  operation  and  maintenance  and  in  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  associated \nfacilities.  The  fiscal  and  financing  dimensions  are  significant,  with  estimates  of  urban  and \nindustrial WSS investment and operating needs necessitating $350 million annually over the \nnext 10 years. While Azerbaijan\u2019s high economic growth offers an opportunity to meet some of \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2003. Azerbaijan Municipal Services Study. Washington, DC. \n5  2004 data. World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators 2004. Washington, DC. \n6  The United Nations Environmental Performance Review, 2004 gives sewage coverage in Baku as 72%.  \n ", "4 \nthese needs, investments alone are inadequate to solve the existing problems unless overall \nmanagement of WSS service delivery is improved and efficiency measures are introduced.  \n \n18.  Improved public infrastructure, sustainable environmental management, better public \nadministration, and good governance are key strategic goals of the state program (footnote 1). \nThe Government has developed a large-scale investment program, estimated at $3.5 billion \nover  the  next  10  years.  To  date,  the  Government  has  received  about  $890  million  from \ninternational financial institutions to upgrade service quality. For financial sustainability, the \nGovernment established the Tariff Council to guide tariff policies, and increased water tariffs in \nJanuary  2007  by  about  87%  for  all  water  users.  It  also  introduced  international  financial \nreporting standards for all utilities, including SuKanals, to improve financial management and \nsustainability. However, the Government still needs additional financial support for WSS both \nfrom international financial institutions and its own resources.  \n \n19.  Operational and Financial Management. In general, SuKanals and JSCs lack clearly \ndefined statements of functions, duties and responsibilities, and operating procedures. Key \nissues are \n(i)  Insufficient autonomy. Lack of autonomy for SuKanals and JSCs to operate, \nmaintain,  and  manage  WSS  systems\u2014and  dependence  on  AZERSU  and \nSAWMA for operational decisions\u2014impede the sense of ownership, initiative, \nresponsibility,  and  accountability,  which  are  the  foundations  of  good  utility \nmanagement. Water and sewage tariffs are low, and collection of revenues is \nhampered by unwillingness of SuKanals and JSCs to discontinue services to \nnonpaying customers. \n(ii)  Lack of managerial capacity. Excessive focus on production and insufficient \nattention to maintenance, efficiency, and information management typify weak \nmanagement  and  poorly  governed  systems  in  SuKanals  and  JSCs.  All \ninformation is manually recorded, and updated and reliable engineering drawings \nand maps are often unavailable. Actual data on operations and network are \nvirtually nonexistent, and performance monitoring and benchmarking systems \nare  rarely  adopted.  Manual  billing,  poor  collection  efficiency,  inadequate \nbookkeeping,  and  outdated  customer  databases  contribute  to  poor  financial \nmanagement and low productivity.  \n \n20.  Policy dialogue was held with the Government on several key issues: (i) economic \nconsiderations of investments and the necessity of designing WSS infrastructure of optimal \nsize and capacity; (ii) independent municipal and corporatized utilities regulated by AZERSU \nand SAWMA; (iii) tariff levels and the importance of the utilities\u2019 financial sustainability; (iv) \noutsourcing  and  introduction  of  performance-based  management  contracts  following  the \ncompletion  of  physical  works;  (v)  viewing  WSS  as  one  sector,  and  the  importance  of \nenvironmental sustainability; (vi) conversion of SuKanals to JSCs following the infrastructure \ndevelopment;  and  (vii)  public  outreach  program  for  mainstreaming  consumers'  concerns, \nincluding gender.  \n \n21.  To  become  sustainable,  SuKanals  and  JSCs  need  to  improve  their  operational \nefficiency,  reform  their  management  structure,  and  introduce  cost-saving  and  revenue-\nimproving  measures.  Two  main  areas  for  improving  financial  management  are  revenue \ncollection and operating costs. Revenue collection can be increased by (i) improving service \ndelivery, (ii) reforming billing and collection procedures, (iii) updating the consumer database to \nregister all new and illegal consumers, (iv) classifying customers by their payment history and \ntargeting  intermittent  payers  and  persistent  non-payers  with  public  outreach  programs,  (v) \n ", "5 \ngranting legal powers to SuKanals and JSCs to enforce a disconnection policy for bill defaulters, \nand (vi) metering all connections. Operating costs can be reduced by introducing improved cost \ncontrol and budgeting systems and procedures and by implementing cost-reduction techniques. \nPrime areas for cost reduction include electricity and redundant administrative costs. \nC.  Program Rationale \n22.  The quality, coverage, and reliability of infrastructure and services have not kept pace \nwith the rapid growth of Azerbaijan\u2019s economy and secondary town population. Insufficient and \nunreliable infrastructure and services are adding to household costs and diminishing the quality \nof life of the towns' population. An intensive program of reforms and organizational development \nof service providers\u2014coupled with long-term capacity development and significant investment in \ninfrastructure and services at the town-level\u2014is necessary, especially for meeting the state \nprogram on poverty reduction and sustainable development goals.  \n \n23.  Increasing demands on existing WSS infrastructure mean that WSS needs cannot be \nfully  met  through  traditional  government  provision,  subsidies,  and  transfers.  Therefore, \nalternative sources of financing and new ways of providing infrastructure and self-financed \nservices are required. The Government requested that ADB extend financing for the Investment \nProgram through an MFF. The MFF modality is justified, because \n(i)  it establishes the foundation for an 8-year partnership between ADB and the \nGovernment; \n(ii)  it combines interrelated physical and nonphysical investments;  \n(iii)  it allows for investments to be phased; and \n(iv)  it is backed by a clear strategy and policy framework and underpins a sound \ninvestment program. \n \n24.  Stand-alone projects would lead to higher transaction costs and deny the chance to \nestablish a long-term partnership. A sector loan approach would be less efficient than an MFF, \nas  the  Investment  Program  has  relatively  large  investments,  less  suitable  for  sector  loan \nlending. A program loan would only focus on reforms. \n \nD.  Prior External Assistance and Lessons  \n25.  Current ADB assistance to WSS in Azerbaijan comprises a $30 million loan for the \nUrban WSS Project and a $1.24 million grant for related technical assistance.7 The Investment \nProgram builds upon these interventions by greatly assisting secondary towns in Azerbaijan. \nOther development partners helping develop Azerbaijan\u2019s urban WSS include the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Natexis \nBanques Populaires, German development cooperation through KfW, and World Bank. Details \non external assistance are in Appendix 3. \n \n26.  The Investment Program design takes into account lessons from the current ADB WSS \nProject,  which  experienced  start-up  delays  but  is  now  performing  well.  There,  ADB's \nengagement in the sector, like all other donors, has been affected by (i) executing agency (EA) \ndelays in recruiting consultants, preparing engineering designs, and appointing contractors; (ii) \nAZERSU's lack of autonomy in procurement and dependence on government decision-making \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \nManila (Loans 2119-AZE(SF)/2120-AZE, $30 million). \n ", "6 \nprocesses; (iii) limited national consulting and contract management capacity; (iv) limited role of \nSuKanals and JSCs in project implementation; (v) little support from EAs to develop SuKanal \nand  JSC  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain  completed  projects;  (vi)  lack  of  community \nawareness  of  project  benefits;  and  (vii)  limited  public  awareness  of  project  planning  and \noperation and maintenance requirements. ADB, along with other key donors, are tackling these \nproblems with a range of responses, including a major institutional reform study by the World \nBank, augmented by a capacity development facility for strengthening agencies involved in \ninfrastructure delivery. \n \n27.  ADB has identified key lessons, such as (i) consumers understand the need for higher \ntariffs, but first need to see adequate and reliable WSS services in place; (ii) rigorous project \nadministration and quick responses to emerging problems are important to achieve timelines; \n(iii) given the involvement of several development partners that have similarly large programs \n(e.g.,  World  Bank),  strong  coordination  and  a  shared  view  on  reforms  are  crucial;  (iv)  a \nsuccessful water utility requires skilled, experienced staff; and (v) sustainable operation and \nmaintenance practices underlie the achievement of a project's economic benefits. Finally, an \nadequate provision for staff training, based on a needs analysis, ensures that capacity gaps are \naddressed.  \n \n28.  The Investment Program design addresses these lessons by (i) commencing advance \nprocurement actions on consultant recruitment and works from the loan fact-finding stage; (ii) \nintroducing a program management facility to AZERSU and SAWMA to identify, process, and \nimplement projects on schedule; (iii) providing a financing modality (i.e., the MFF) that provides \nmore clarity for longer-term project funding in the sector; (iv) encouraging economies of scale \nwith larger and fewer construction contracts and better supervision; (v) introducing incentive \nprovisions in the contractors' contracts to speed up execution; (vi) obtaining strong government \nsupport for expediting approval procedures through monthly review meetings; committing to \ninstitutional restructuring; and rationalizing systems related to tariff setting, computerized billing \nand recording, and metering; (vii) including institutional effectiveness (component B) through a \ntwinning  arrangement  with  an  external  WSS  utility  for  sharing  of  technical,  financial,  and \nadministrative  best  practices;  and  (viii)  including  a  public  outreach  program  to  generate \nawareness about the Investment Program, and promoting equity and inclusiveness through a \ngender  action  plan.  The  design  and  implementation  of  measures  for  improved  WSS \nmanagement will be closely coordinated with other ongoing donor-funded projects.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n29.  The  Investment  Program  will  improve  public  health  and  the  environment  in  the \nparticipating  secondary  towns  and  peri-urban  areas  surrounding  Baku\u2014areas  comprising \n500,000 residents. The outcome will be improved coverage, and the continuity and quality of \nwater supplies and wastewater disposal.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n30.  The outputs of the Investment Program include (i) the physical expansion of the WSS \nsystem;  (ii)  greater  institutional  efficiencies  and  management;  and  (iii)  better  planning, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The Investment Program spans over 8 years and includes \nthe following components. \n \n ", "7 \n \n1.  Component A: Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure Development  \n31.  Component A will include rehabilitation, reconstruction, and extension of WSS networks \nin six towns and peri-urban areas surrounding Baku. Activities will comprise (i) water source \ndevelopment  (i.e.,  identification,  improvement,  and  augmentation);  (ii)  laying  new  and/or \nrehabilitating  existing  water  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines;  (iii)  developing  storage \nreservoirs  and  water  treatment  plants;  (iv)  installing  bulk  and  individual  water  meters;  (v) \nconducting water quality monitoring; (vi) undertaking sewage network improvements; and (vii) \nconstructing new and/or rehabilitating existing wastewater treatment plants.  \n \n32.  Tranche 1. Under the first tranche, component A will finance physical investments in \nWSS  systems  covering  (i)  water  distribution  and  sewage  system  reconstruction  and  their \nextension in Goychay; and (ii) for Nakhchivan, new water intake and treatment facilities, new \nwater transmission mains from the water reservoir to the city, water feeder mains, and trunk \nsewers in selected zones. This component will also finance installation of bulk and individual \nwater meters, and ensure water quality and treated effluent monitoring in both areas. \n \n33.  Tranches  2\u20135.  Under  the  subsequent  tranches,  component  A  will  finance  WSS \ninfrastructure  in  Agdash,  Agdjabedi,  Balaken,  Beylagan,  Goychay,  Nakhchivan,  peri-urban \nareas surrounding Baku, and other developing urban centers. \n34.  This  component  will  increase  water  supply  coverage  and  the  number  of  metered \nconnections to piped networks; reduce system leaks to ensure 24-hour supply of pressurized, \nsafe drinking water; and improve the disposal and treatment of wastewater.  \n2.   Component B: Institutional Effectiveness  \n35.  This  component  will  finance  nonphysical  instruments  targeting  (i)  institutional \nimprovements for WSS service delivery; (ii) capacity development for better system planning, \noperation,  and  maintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  through  metering,  billing,  and \ncollection tariffs; (iv) increased efficiency for timely processing of effective WSS projects; and \n(v) a twinning arrangement with an external WSS utility to support capacity development.  \na.  Improving Operating Efficiency  \n36.  This subcomponent will improve institutional performance through streamlined financial, \ntechnical, and procurement operations. Planned interventions are (i) technical, operational, and \nmanagement  training  for  SuKanals  and  JSCs;  (ii)  improving  financial  management  by \nintroducing better accounting procedures, computerized billing, and management information \nsystems that feature budgeting, inventory of assets and staffing, operation and maintenance of \nassets,  meter  reading,  billing,  revenue  collection,  and  reporting  systems;  (iii)  rationalizing \nexisting  tariffs  and  introducing  a  tariff  plan  that  incorporates  progressive  tariff  revision  by \nincluding  inflation  and  cost  of  services;  (iv) measures  for  reduction  of  electricity  and \nadministrative costs; (v) asset management and development of operational manuals; and (vi) \nintroducing  a  performance  benchmarking  system  for  SuKanals  and  JSCs  comparing  their \nprogress over time. Wherever possible, technical training will be linked to measurable outputs to \nhelp determine whether skill levels have been achieved and technical training is applied. This \nsubcomponent  will  also  finance  office  furniture  and  basic  office  equipment  to  computerize \noperations. The design and implementation of measures for improved WSS management will be \ncoordinated with ongoing donor-funded projects.  \n ", "8 \n \n37.  Under this subcomponent, a disconnection policy for non-payers will be formulated to \nempower SuKanals and JSCs. In parallel, an incentive plan will be prepared for regular payers. \nCustomer care centers, with trained male and female employees, will be established to resolve \ncustomer  complaints  through  effective  information  and  customer  feedback  systems.  This \nsubcomponent will also improve business rules by clearly defining staffing needs, functions, and \nduties, and clarifying responsibilities of management. \nb.  Public Outreach Program \n38.  This subcomponent will generate program awareness and mainstream consumers in \nsupporting project implementation. Town water users\u2019 associations (TWUAs) will be formed to \nrepresent consumer interests, including gender. TWUAs will monitor consumer satisfaction of \nthe improved service quality, and ensure timely reporting of any system malfunction, leaks, or \nenvironmental issues to SuKanals and JSCs. TWUAs will also educate consumers on their \nresponsibility to pay for improved services. Under this subcomponent, TWUA capacity will be \ndeveloped through program monitoring facilities in public awareness; hygiene and sanitation; \nand  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns.  Both  men  and  women  will \nparticipate in the public hygiene awareness campaign. This subcomponent will also develop a \ncomprehensive communications strategy to encourage information sharing and effective press \nrelations. \n \n39.  Tranche 1 and Subsequent Tranches. Component B will be implemented in its entirety \nunder the tranche 1 project in the towns of Goychay  and Nakhchivan. Under subsequent \ntranches, component B will finance similar activities in Agdash, Agdjabedi, Balaken, Beylagan, \nperi-urban areas surrounding Baku, and other urban centers.  \n \n3.    Component C: Establishment of a Program Management Facility  \n40.  Component C will provide (i) project management support and assistance to carry out \ndue diligence for new tranches; (ii) help with gender, safeguards, governance, legal, financial, \nand administrative matters; (iii) design works for subsequent tranches; and (iv) general training \nand development.  \n \n41.  A program management office (PMO) to be established for each EA (AZERSU and \nSAWMA) will have counterpart staff members and program management facility consultants. \nEach  program  management  facility  will  comprise  a  team  of  international  and  national \nconsultants to be recruited through international firms and individuals. These consultants will \nsupport PMOs in (i) preparing periodic financing requests; (ii) preparing detailed design for \nfuture investments; (iii) managing bid processes; (iv) supervising procurement and construction; \n(v) overseeing safeguards and gender compliance; (vi) coordinating rayon (town) agencies; (vii) \nmonitoring and evaluating program progress and preparing progress reports; (viii) providing \nexpertise  in  project  management,  planning,  results  measurement,  and  training;  and  (ix) \nproviding  hands-on  training  to  SuKanals  and  JSCs  during  each  stage  of  program \nimplementation. \n \n42.  Tranche 1 and Subsequent Tranches. Under the tranche 1 project, component C will \nfinance operations of PMOs and implementation oversight at Goychay and Nakhchivan JSCs. \nThe component will also (i) finance the international consulting firm to undertake bid process \nmanagement, (ii) help the JSCs oversee construction, (iii) prepare detailed engineering designs \nand drawings for works at Agdjabedi, Balaken, and Beylagan; and (iv) undertake feasibility \n ", "9 \nstudies in peri-urban settlements of Baku. Subsequent tranches will finance implementation \noversight at JSCs and consulting services for supervising works in the remaining program \ntowns. \n \nC.  Special Features \n43.  Advance  Project  Readiness. The existing WSS infrastructure needs in Azerbaijan \ndemand  expeditious  preparation  of  projects  and  timely  processing  of  loans.  The  sector \ndevelopment  road  map  and  investment  plan  (Appendix  2)  implementation  includes  special \narrangements to meet this requirement. Detailed design of works under the tranche 1 project \nhas already been completed. With advance procurement actions already under way, contract \nawards for priority packages of works and consultancy services are planned immediately after \nloan effectiveness. Also, due diligence for the tranche 2 project has also been completed in \nparallel, and processing for the second PFR is planned to be completed within 6 months after \napproval of the Investment Program. Accordingly, the program management facility consultants \nunder the first tranche project will have four teams to carry out tasks for tranche 1, 2, and 3 \nprojects. Team 1 will be responsible for contract awards and construction supervision of tranche \n1 project activities, team 2 will carry out advance detailed design work for tranche 2 project \nactivities, team 3 will conduct due diligence for tranche 3 project activities, and team 4 will carry \nout tasks for the institutional effectiveness of service providers and help the PMOs with gender, \nsafeguards, governance, legal, financial, and administrative matters, and general training and \ndevelopment.  \n \n44.  Change  in  Business  Culture  and  Management.  Because  of  heavy  subsidies \ntraditionally provided to the sector\u2014as well as deteriorated systems, inadequate resources, low \ntariffs, and poor payment discipline in the sector\u2014water supply in Azerbaijan is widely perceived \nto be a loss-suffering business. SuKanals have become reactive service providers without \nadequate incentives to expand their customer base. As a result, their management is not \nforward-looking,  staff  members  are  inadequately  motivated,  daily  operating  procedures  are \nabandoned, and consumer complaints are not properly recorded and answered. The Investment \nProgram will strengthen the financial viability of WSS services and make the SuKanals more \nautonomous and accountable by investing in infrastructure improvements, introducing needed \ninstitutional and financial reforms, and enhancing the skills and capability of SuKanal staff. \nSuKanals  will  be  given  more  incentives  to  improve  their  performance  and  expand  their \nbusiness, procedures will be prepared and implemented in daily operations, performance will be \nbenchmarked, and a consumer complaint mechanism will be developed and adopted. The \nSuKanals  should  thus  be  transformed  gradually  from  reactive  to  business-oriented  service \nproviders, with a forward-looking strategy and internal incentives to upgrade knowledge and \nskills, control costs, improve performance, and expand their customer base. Consumers\u2019 rights \nand customer contracts will become a core part of the SuKanals\u2019 business culture. \n \n45.  Metering. The water meter is the cash register and a critical management tool in water \nsupply  systems.  Together  with  volumetric  pricing,  it  provides  an  incentive  for  water \nconservation, thereby  protecting water resources and enabling the postponement of costly \nsystem expansion. It also allows SuKanals and JSCs to locate distribution losses and to charge \nfor  water  consumption  on  the  basis  of  use\u2014generally  perceived  to  be  the  fairest  way  of \nallocating the costs of water supply to users. However, most water consumers and water \nproduction and pumping facilities in Azerbaijan are not metered, preventing SuKanals from \nproperly planning, charging for, and measuring their operation. The Investment Program will \nprovide water meters for all production, distribution, and consumption, thereby creating an \nessential foundation for many SuKanal and JSC operations, including business planning and \n ", "10 \nmanagement, water loss reduction, efficient operation and maintenance, revenue collection, and \nperformance measurement and targeting. \n \n46.  Performance  Benchmarking.  Performance  benchmarking  is  another  important \nmanagement  and  planning  tool  for  utility  management.  The  results  of  the  benchmarking \nprogram will help sector decision makers and SuKanal and/or JSC managers understand more \nprecisely WSS service performance, difficulties, and challenges, and compare performance with \nother water utilities in the region, country, and even worldwide. The decision makers and \nmanagers  can  thus  come  up  with  more  relevant  decisions  and  actions  to  improve  sector \nmanagement and development, set realistic service targets, and strengthen the performance of \nSuKanals and JSCs. Performance benchmarking is also essential in sector regulation and \nprovides important reference information for setting service standards and reviewing tariffs. \nHowever, performance benchmarking is not practiced in Azerbaijan, mainly because there are \nnot enough meters installed. Once meters are installed, the Investment Program will help each \nSuKanal develop and implement a simple benchmarking system with one or two indicators for \neach  key  performance  area  (i.e.,  technical,  financial,  institutional,  and  customer  services). \nTraining will be provided to build the capacity to collect, analyze, and compare the data as part \nof ongoing performance monitoring. This process of performance monitoring will help set the \nbasis for further reforms in the sector, including public\u2013private partnerships.  \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n47.  Sector  investment  needs  are  based  on  the  sector  development  road  map  and \ninvestment plan, which estimates the total sector needs at $3.5 billion by 2015 for 62 secondary \ntowns and rayon centers. Committed financing through international financial institutions is \n$1.235 billion, resulting in a shortfall of $2.310 billion. The Investment Program is estimated at \n$800 million equivalent (Table 1) and covers approximately 35% of the shortfall. The remaining \n65% may be met through additional resources from international financial institutions and the \nGovernment's own contribution. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan for the tranche 1 \nproject are in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 1: Investment Program, 2009\u20132017a \n($ million) \nSector  % Share of \nInvestment  Investment  Investment \nInvestment Program Component  Plan  Program  Plan \nA  Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure Development  2,264  778b  34.4 \nB   Management Capacity Development    8b  17.4 \n46 \nC  Project Management Facility   14b  30.4 \n      Total Investment Program  2,310  800  34.6 \nFinancing Sources       \n   Asian Development Bank    600  75 \n  Government    200  25 \na     Last PFR submission under the Investment Program is expected in 2014.    \nb  These figures are based on indicative estimates for the Investment Program, which will be adjusted based on \ndetailed assessment during processing of each tranche.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank; Azersu Joint Stock Company; and State Amelioration and Water Management \nAgency, Nakhchivan estimates. \n \n ", "11 \nE.  Financing Plan \n48.  ADB will finance the Investment Program through an MFF, in an amount up to $600 \nmillion, from its ordinary capital resources (OCR) over an 8-year implementation period.8 This \nrepresents 75% of the Investment Program\u2019s total cost. The loans will cover cost of civil works, \nequipment and material, institutional development and capacity building, land and resettlement, \nloan financing charges, and part of the expenditures for consultancy and contingencies. The \nGovernment  will  provide  counterpart  financing  to  cover  PMO  expenditures,  surveys  and \ninvestigation,  part  of  the  consulting  services  costs,  local  taxes  and  duties,  and  other \nmiscellaneous costs. The financing plan for the Investment Program and the tranche 1 project is \nin Table 2 and estimates for subsequent tranches in Table 3. \n \n49.  The MFF will consist of several loans to finance a range of projects under the Investment \nProgram, subject to the submission of related PFRs by the Government; execution of related \nloan agreements (FFAs); and fulfillment of terms, conditions, and undertakings set forth in a \nFFA by the Government. The OCR financing will follow the provisions of ordinary operations \nloan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans, subject to \nmodifications that may be included under individual loan agreements.  \n \n50.  The Government has submitted to ADB the PFR for tranche 1, requesting a loan of \n$75 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance the tranche 1 project. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nGovernment will relend the proceeds of the loan to AZERSU ($47 million) and SAWMA ($28 \nmillion) on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loans. The minimum \namount of subsequent PFRs will be $75 million. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Investment Program    Tranche 1 \nSource   Amount  %  Amount  % \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources  600.0  75  75.0  75 \nGovernment   200.0  25  25.0  25 \nTotal  800.0  100  100.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 3: Indicative Financing Plan by Tranche \n($ million) \nSource  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Tranche 5  Total  % \nADB  75.0  170.0  180.0  100.0   75.0  600.0  75.0 \nGovernment  25.0   56.7   60.0   33.3   25.0  200.0  25.0 \nTotal  100.0  226.7   240.0   133.3   100.0  800.0  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. estimates \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila.  \n ", "12 \n51.  Financing  may  be  made  available,  providing  that  the  Investment  Program  is \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  general  understandings  and  expectations  for  the  MFF, \nincluding the terms, conditions, and undertakings set forth in the FFA. Progress toward the \nexpected outcomes as set out in the design and monitoring framework will be part of the \ndecision-making criteria and filters for continuing ADB support. Satisfactory compliance with the \nsafeguards requirements and social development policies, as well as with all other undertakings \nset forth in the FFA, will also guide ADB\u2019s decision to continue financing under individual \ntranches. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n52.  AZERSU will be the EA for all project activities except those in Nakhchivan Autonomous \nRepublic, where SAWMA will be the EA. The PMOs created at AZERSU and SAWMA will be \nresponsible for supporting project implementation. Each PMO will comprise international and \nnational consultants to be engaged through international firms and individuals, and counterpart \nstaff. The EAs will maintain their respective PMO counterpart staff with at least a program \ndirector and/or contract management specialist, a financial management and/or disbursement \nspecialist, a WSS and/or monitoring and evaluation specialist, and a safeguards expert. The \nPMOs will (i) submit PFRs; (ii) undertake due diligence for subsequent projects; (iii) prepare \ndetailed design for future investments; (iv) supervise procurement and construction; (v) oversee \nsafeguards and gender compliance; (vi) coordinate among rayon agencies; (vii) monitor and \nevaluate program progress and prepare progress reports; and (viii) provide expertise in project \nmanagement, planning, results measurement, and training. Sukanals and JSCs in participating \nrayons will designate a qualified implementation team to work with the PMO during program \nimplementation. Such team will include at least 1 water supply engineer, 1 sewage specialist, 3 \nfield inspectors, and 2 electromechanical technicians. The PMOs will provide hands-on training \nto staff during each stage of program implementation. To further ensure sustainable operation of \nWSS services, SuKanals and JSCs will be trained through a twinning arrangement with an \nexternal WSS company. The structure of the PMO and the lines of communication are shown in \nAppendix 5, Figures A5.1 and A5.2.  \n \n53.  In support of the Investment Program, 2 committees will be set up within 3 months of \nloan effectiveness. \n(i)  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  by  the  cabinet  of \nministers. It will be headed by a high-level official from the cabinet of ministers \nand composed of officials from AZERSU, the Ministry of Economic Development, \nthe Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health, SAWMA, and heads of related \nrayon administrations. The committee will provide general policy and strategic \noversight, resolve interagency problems, and oversee progress of projects. It will \nalso decide on subsequent PFRs and evaluate implementation of the Investment \nProgram based on the design and monitoring framework. It will meet at least \nonce every 3 months, and share the minutes of its meetings with ADB. \n(ii)   At the operational level, a project implementation review committee (PIRC) will \nbe established by the administration for each participating rayon, chaired by the \nhead of the rayon administration and comprising officials from SuKanals and \nJSCs,  TWUAs,  and  related  program  management  facility  consultants.  These \ncommittees  will  review  monthly  implementation  progress  and  ensure  timely \nresolution of operational issues. Any unresolved issue may be referred to the \nrelevant EA or the project steering committee for action.  \n ", "13 \n   \n2.  Implementation Schedule and Period \n54.  The overall implementation period for the Investment Program is 8 years from November \n2009 to May 2018. The projects for the first two tranches will mainly comprise subproject \nactivities in Goychay, Nakhchivan, and Agdash. The subproject activities have been selected on \nthe  basis  of  their  relative  priority  under  the  Investment  Program  and  their  readiness  for \nimplementation. Subsequent tranches will be sequenced based on (i) their state of readiness, \nand  (ii)  the  compliance  level  with  the  reform  milestones  set  out  in  the  sector  road  map \n(Appendix 2). The implementation schedule of the Investment Program is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement financed from the loans under the MFF will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International \ncompetitive bidding procedures will be followed for civil works contracts estimated at $3 million \nor more. Civil works contracts estimated at less than $3 million will be procured under national \ncompetitive bidding procedures. Single-stage, one-envelope bidding procedure will be adopted \nfor all civil works contracts under the Investment Program. Appendix 7 contains a procurement \nplan and main contract packages under the first tranche.  \n \n56.  International competitive bidding procedures will be used to procure goods and services \nestimated to cost $1 million or more. National competitive bidding procedures will be followed \nfor procurement of goods and services estimated to cost less than $1 million. For specialized \nequipment, such as proprietary software and small materials contracts valued at less than \n$100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n57.  Consultants will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures \nand/or individual consultant selection procedures in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). One consultancy firm selected under each \ntranche for the two program management facilities, one each at AZERSU and SAWMA, will \ndesignate  a  separate  team  for  each  EA.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  program \nmanagement facility consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n58.  Under each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request: \n(i) advance contracting; and (ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to 20% of the \nproposed individual loan, incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the date of signing of the related legal agreement. The Government acknowledges that \nany  approval  of  advance  contracting  and/or  retroactive  financing  will  not  constitute  a \ncommitment by ADB to finance the related project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n59.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  AZERSU,  and  SAWMA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \n ", "14 \nInvestment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in loan regulations and bidding documents for the Investment Program. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nAZERSU,  SAWMA,  participating  SuKanals  and  JSCs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n60.  The financial management capacity of AZERSU and SAWMA to be strengthened under \nthe Investment Program is expected to mitigate the risks of corruption under the Investment \nProgram. The comprehensive public sector reforms and institutional development program is \nintended to increase public accountability of AZERSU, SAWMA, SuKanals, and JSCs, and to \nreduce the risk of corruption. AZERSU and SAWMA will ensure that (i) anticorruption provisions \nacceptable to ADB are included in all bidding documents and contracts, including provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  AZERSU, \nSAWMA, relevant SuKanals and JSCs, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the activities carried out under the Investment Program; (ii) all \ndecisions  relating  to  procurement  are  made  by  the  Tendering  Committee  that  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance,  State \nProcurement Agency (as observer), and other relevant agencies in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines; and (iii) the supervision consultant verifies the contractors\u2019 invoices in \naccordance with working drawings and contract specifications.  \n \n61.  AZERSU and SAWMA agreed to take additional measures to improve governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  including  (i)  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts, \naccounts, and financial statements; and (ii) timely disclosure of information on selection of \nconsultants and contractors through local newspapers. Regarding financial management, the \nInvestment  Program  will  support  the  development  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA's  accounting \nsystems  and  publication  of  financial  information  on  their  websites.  In  strengthening \ntransparency, AZERSU and SAWMA will disclose basic information concerning activities and \nprogress of the Investment Program on their respective websites, including procurement-related \ninformation,  financial  statements,  and  physical  progress.  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  have  also \nagreed to establish a web-based public grievance redress system that can be used for handling \ngrievances  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  Regarding  the  procurement  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  contracts,  the  websites  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  will  disclose  lists  of \nparticipating  bidders,  names  of  winning  bidders,  basic  details  of  the  bidding  procedures \nadopted, contract values, and lists of goods and services procured.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n62.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Additional disbursement arrangements may \nbe set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n63.  To  ensure  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  expedite  project  implementation, \nimmediately after the effectiveness of each tranche, an imprest account will be established for \neach executing agency at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB to cover eligible expenditures \nunder  the  Investment  Program.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nagreed detailed arrangements. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest account will \nnot exceed the lower of (i) the estimated expenditure to be financed from the imprest account \nfor AZERSU or SAWMA for the initial 6 months of project implementation; or (ii) the equivalent \n ", "15 \nof  10%  of  the  respective  loan  amounts  relent  to  AZERSU  or  SAWMA.  The  \nstatement-of-expenditures procedure may be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures \nfor the Investment Program and to liquidate advances provided to the imprest accounts. Any \npayment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement-of-expenditures procedure will not \nexceed $100,000. The loan proceeds may also be disbursed directly to the consultants and \ncontractors under the direct payment procedure. \n \n8.  Accounts, Records, and Audits \n64.  AZERSU and SAWMA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made under the MFF, including expenditures for \nworks,  equipment,  and  services  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  Both \nAZERSU and SAWMA will have a full set of financial statements. These project accounts and \nrelated  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards and by auditors acceptable to ADB. AZERSU and SAWMA will submit annual audited \nreports  (including  separate  audit  opinions  on  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  \nstatement-of-expenditure procedures) and audited financial statements to ADB within 6 months \nafter the end of each fiscal year. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n65.  AZERSU and SAWMA, through their respective PMOs, will establish an investment \nprogram  performance  monitoring  system  acceptable  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  the \neffectiveness of the first loan under the MFF. These systems will help monitor and evaluate the \nperformance  of  the  Investment  Program  and  projects  under  each  loan  of  the MFF.  It  will \nincorporate a set of performance monitoring indicators relating to outputs and outcomes in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework,  including  service  delivery  performance,  physical \nimplementation, management improvement, and capacity development milestones. The PMOs \nwill develop baseline data for each of the selected indicators, conduct annual surveys, and \nupdate ADB on the progress against each indicator. For project activities procured under the \nturnkey  and  design\u2013build\u2013operate  modalities  planned  following  the  tranche  1  project,  key \nperformance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be developed during the preparation of requests \nfor proposals and draft contract documents for such project activities. \n \n66.   The PMO of AZERSU and SAWMA will prepare annual reports on the progress against \nthe above performance monitoring indicators, to be submitted to ADB within 30 days after the \nreview period. The reports will incorporate the information provided by relevant SuKanals and \nJSCs.9 The reports will discuss progress made during the period of review, changes if any on \nimplementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered and remedial actions taken, and \nwork to be undertaken in the coming quarter.  \n \n10.  Investment Program Review  \n67.  The  Government,  AZERSU,  SAWMA,  and  ADB  will  jointly  review  implementation \nprogress of the Investment Program twice yearly. The review will discuss performance of the \ncomponents under each project and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial \nmeasures needing to be undertaken toward achieving the objectives of project components and \nthe overall Investment Program.  \n                                                 \n9  These targets will be reflected in each sukanal and/or JSC annual work plan and budget, and serve as the basis for \nmonitoring progress. \n ", "16 \n \n68.  A  more  comprehensive  review  at  the  midterm  of  each  project  will  (i)  evaluate  the \nproject\u2019s  scope,  design,  and  implementation  arrangements;  (ii) evaluate  the  progress  of \ncomponents A, B, and C; (iii) evaluate the performance of the program management facility; (iv) \nidentify  changes  needed  in  any  or  all  of  the  above  areas;  (v)  assess  the  implementation \nperformance against agreed targets in the respective design and monitoring frameworks; (vi) \nidentify critical issues and constraints, if any; and (vii) recommend adjustments to the project \ndesign  and/or  implementation  arrangements,  if  necessary.  Such  midterm  reviews  will  also \nconduct  performance  assessments  of  previous  projects  to  evaluate  the  achievement  of \nexpected development impacts. A similar midterm review of the Investment Program will be \nundertaken in the fifth year from the date of ADB\u2019s approval of the MFF.  \n \n69.  AZERSU and SAWMA will submit to ADB a project completion report (for each individual \nproject) and a completion report for the Investment Program within 3 months of their physical \ncompletion.  These  reports  will  provide  detailed  evaluation  of  the  projects  (to  the  extent \napplicable  to  AZERSU  and  SAWMA,  respectively),  including  the  (i)  design;  (ii)  costs;  (iii) \ncontractor and consultant performance; (iv) social, environmental, and economic impacts; (v) \neconomic rate of return; and (vi) other details for each project and the Investment Program, as \nmay be requested by ADB. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n70.  The economic and financial analysis was carried out on the tranche 1 project. For the \nfinancial analysis, the weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 2.47%, the financial \ninternal rate of return in the base case ranged between 4.5% and 5.5%, and the financial net \npresent value in the base case ranged from $14.9 million to $15.0 million. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital in all cases. The economic \nopportunity cost of capital was assumed at 12%, the EIRRs in the base case range between \n18.0% and 20.8%, and the economic net present value in the base case ranged from $7.55 \nmillion to $7.63 million. The resulting benefit\u2013cost ratios for the tranche 1 project range between \n1.38  and  1.54,  also  denoting  feasibility.  Economic  benefits  were  derived  from  analysis  of \nwillingness-to-pay surveys. Sensitivity analysis conducted to test the robustness of the financial \nsustainability and economic viability of subcomponents when subject to change (a 20% increase \nin capital cost, 20% increase in operation and maintenance cost, 20% reduction in benefits, and \n1-year delay in benefits) indicate that, in all cases, subcomponent financial internal rates of \nreturn  surpass  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  and  EIRRs  surpass  the  economic \nopportunity cost of capital. Details of the economic and financial analyses are in Appendixes 8 \nand 9, and in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n71.  Assessment of financial sustainability and economic viability suggests that the integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. For higher financial and economic \nreturns, the planned coverage needs to be achieved and a smooth transition undertaken from \ncompletion  of  works  to  operation.  Analysis  findings  indicate  that  the  tranche  1  project  is \nfinancially viable on two measures: (i) required periodic tariff increases (herewith assumed \nevery 2 years), and (ii) providing viability gap funding based on cost recovery with regard to \nconsumer affordability. For these measures to be relevant to succeeding subcomponents in \nsubsequent  tranches,  they  would  be  incorporated  when  preparing  subcomponent  financial \noperational plans. These plans and related issues have been discussed and agreed to with the \n ", "17 \nEAs  for  achieving  financial  sustainability  of  the  overall  investment.  Issues  pertaining  to \nsubsidization,  manner  of  implementation,  and  funds  sourcing  are  specifically  relevant. \nAffordability is a major factor in determining the subsidy requirement, and thus household \nincome bases may need to be reviewed periodically. There is an ongoing effort by the JSCs for \nimproved tariff collection by focusing on better service delivery and registering complaints.  \n \nB.  Financial Management Assessment \n72.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  (Supplementary \nAppendix  E)  confirmed  that  the  financial  management,  reporting,  and  monitoring  systems \npractices are satisfactory, with low to moderate risk to ADB and other financiers. The EAs are \nadequately staffed with efficient and experienced personnel. Project staff members are trained \nin procedural requirements of ADB and national accounting standards. Systems and controls, \nincluding accounting and financial reporting, auditing, internal control, fund disbursement and \nflows, and information systems, comply with good operating practices and meet the Investment \nProgram's  financial  management  requirement.  Fund  flows  from  ongoing  projects  and  local \nsources are satisfactory, with special accounts and fund-flow procedures established for each \nproject. Improved financial performance monitoring systems under the Investment Program will \nmitigate delays in release of counterpart funds and existing weakness in information exchange \nbetween the executing and implementing agencies. Project external audit arrangements are \nsatisfactory and follow international auditing standards. The management improvement and \ncapacity development component under the Investment Program will substantially improve staff \ncapacity in adopting prudent financial management practices.  \n \nC.  Summary of Benefits, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development \n73.  The  Investment  Program  will  provide  an  estimated  500,000  persons  with  safe, \naffordable, and reliable piped water supplies in addition to dependable wastewater collection \nand treatment services. The Investment Program will also enhance institutional capacities for \nthe repair and management of the water and wastewater systems. Residents of secondary \ntowns within Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic will enjoy the benefits of \nenhanced living conditions and improved health as their basic water and wastewater services \nare upgraded and access to them is expanded. Benefits from the first tranche include (i) an \nestimated 34,200 new or rehabilitated water supply connections with a 24-hour continuous \nservice; (ii) a 65% increase in availability of treated water; (iii) rehabilitation of drainage and \nsewage systems; and (iv) sewage collection capacity to handle 100% of the waste generation in \neach of the participating towns. Table 4 highlights selected tranche 1 project benefits. Less \ntangible  benefits  include  (i)  improved  tariff  collection,  financial  planning,  and  information \nsystems  (including  system  maps  and  inventories,  the  building  blocks  for  good  utility \nmanagement); (ii) greater customer orientation and more informed, responsible consumers \n(particularly  via  the  TWUAs  to  be  created);  and  (iii)  increased  performance  as  AZERSU, \nSAWMA,  SuKanal,  and  JSC  operational  staff  gain  the  necessary  safety  training,  physical \nresources, and technical supervision to do their jobs well.  \n \nTable 4: Tranche 1 Project Benefits  \nItem  2008\u20132009  2010\u20132017 \nHouseholds with Piped Connections (%)  35  100 \nNumber Households with Potable Water > 24 hours day  none  34,200 \nTreated Water Availability (cubic meters per day)  none  19,500 \nWastewater Collected (%)  15  100 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "18 \n \n74.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  strategy  in  Appendix  10  highlights  that  many \nhouseholds in secondary towns have low incomes, and approximately 65% of the existing town \npopulation has no formal connection to piped networks. The Investment Program will support \nthe development of service delivery strategies for low-income consumers, which can include \nreducing barriers to connection, using small-scale service providers, adopting pro-poor tariffs, \ntargeting customer outreach, and other innovative approaches. \n \n75.  Gender. Improvements in the quality, coverage, and reliability of WSS systems will have \na  particularly  positive  impact  on  women.  As  women  are  the  main  collectors  of  water  in \nhouseholds without individual connections, gender concerns will be mainstreamed in the public \noutreach programs, consultations, customer complaint mechanisms, and public accountability \nmeasures taken to promote transparency. In line with the state program (footnote 1), which \nrequires promotion and protection of gender equality in all sectors, the Investment Program will \naddress  gender  issues  by  (i)  strengthening  the  role  of  female  representatives  in  sector \nmanagement,  (ii)  developing  women\u2019s  roles at  the community  level,  (iii)  collecting  gender-\ndisaggregated survey data to develop gender-sensitive social and economic indicators, and (iv) \nconducting monitoring and evaluation to assess gender impacts so appropriate gender planning \ncan be addressed in subsequent tranche designs. The gender action plan gives further details \non how the Investment Program will mainstream gender concerns to promote the inclusion and \nempowerment of women (Appendix 11 and Supplementary Appendix F).  \n  \nD.  Social and Environmental Safeguards  \n76.  Social  Safeguards.  The  tranche  1  project  will  not  have  any  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts  as  documented  in  the  due  diligence  report  prepared  for  each  town \n(Supplementary Appendix J). The Investment Program has generally avoided such impacts by \nchoosing  appropriate  design  options  and  by  prioritizing  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of \nexisting facilities. New construction, to the extent feasible, will be done on unused land already \nowned by the Government. However, for any potential land acquisition and resettlement, the \nInvestment Program will finance the cost to expedite implementation.  \n \n77.  To  address  potential  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  associated  with  the \nfollowing  tranches,  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  applicable  laws  and \nregulations of Azerbaijan. The framework describes general principles, the land acquisition and \nresettlement  process,  compensation  and  assistance  measures  for  affected  people,  and \ninstitutional arrangements. Project-specific land acquisition and resettlement plans or measures \nwill also be prepared for individual tranches. The framework is applicable to all tranches but will \nbe reviewed and updated if necessary at the beginning of each tranche. The summary land \nacquisition and resettlement framework is given in Appendix 12.  \n \n78.  The Investment Program is not expected to affect indigenous people as defined under \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Upon effectiveness of the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) in January 2010, safeguards requirements under that policy will apply in place \nof the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the \nEnvironment Policy (2002).10  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila (para. 81). \n ", "19 \n79.  Environmental  Safeguards.  The  provision  of  potable  piped-water  supply  and \nwastewater collection and treatment will improve the environment in each participating town. \nThe designs involve simple, appropriate, low-cost technology and do not pose any significant \nadverse environmental consequences. The tranche 1 project has been categorized as B under \nADB's Environment Policy (2002). Potential negative environmental impacts for each project are \nmainly  short  term  during  the  construction  period  and  can  be  minimized  by  the  proposed \nmitigation measures and environmentally sound engineering and construction practices. An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  prepared  following  ADB  procedures \n(Appendix 13 and Supplementary Appendix G), follows the environmental assessment and \nreview  procedures  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  EAs  will \nprepare initial environmental examinations for each project, as appropriate. The examination for \nthe tranche 1 project shows no significant adverse environmental impacts (Appendix 14 and \nSupplementary Appendix H). As these examinations, including environment management plans, \nwere  prepared  based  on  field  reconnaissance  survey  and  secondary  reports,  they  will  be \nupdated during the detailed engineering design stage. The design and environment consultant \nwill prepare contract-level and site-specific plans based on the updated and final environmental \nmanagement  plan.  This  will  form  the  basis  for  issuance  of  bidding  documents,  and  the \nenvironmental requirements will be reflected in the contractors' contracts. The contract-level and \nsite-specific environmental management plan will guide the contractors during construction and \nwill also assist the supervision consultant in tracking the contractors' implementation progress.  \n \n80.  Environmental project selection criteria ensure that the Investment Program will not have \nsignificant negative environmental impacts and will have no impact on environmentally sensitive \nareas.  Impacts  that  are  potentially  significant  and/or  irreversible  will  be  avoided.  Potential \nnegative environmental impacts of typical projects are expected to be mostly localized and \ntemporary. These impacts can largely be avoided through proper project design (particularly site \nselection), through proper source abstraction designs, and through appropriate choice of water \nand wastewater treatment technologies and process design parameters. Alternatively, they can \nbe  mitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and  environmental \nmanagement.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  help  ensure \ncompliance with applicable government and ADB environmental requirements and guide the \ndesign and implementation of future subprojects. The environmental team within each PMO will \ninclude  an  environmental  and  social  safeguard  specialist  who,  with  assistance  from  an \ninternational environmental consultant, will apply and enforce the environmental assessment \nand review framework. Training will be conducted by the international consultants to pertinent \nenvironmental group staff within AZERSU, SAWMA, SuKanals, and JSCs. Separate training by \nvarious outside specialists will also be provided for operational staff on the operation and \nmaintenance of water, wastewater, and metering systems. \n \nE.  Assumptions and Potential Risks \n81.  The Investment Program faces several implementation risks. The following key risks \nhave been discussed with the Government and mitigation measures agreed.  \n \n82.  Potential Shortfall in Contractors. The Government has recently signed two large \nprojects with the World Bank for WSS in 43 towns and with Japan International Cooperation \nAgency for 10 towns. With the commencement of the Investment Program, severe shortage of \ncivil works contractors is expected, which may delay implementation. To mitigate this risk, the \nInvestment  Program  includes  (i)  large  international  competitive  bidding  contracts  to  attract \ninternational contracting firms; (ii) advance procurement actions, already undertaken, to ensure \nthat works are commenced shortly after loan approval; and (iii) incentive provisions in the \n ", "20 \ncontractors'  contracts  to  expedite  implementation  and,  by  timely  completion,  enable  the \ncontractors to apply for new contracts under the Investment Program. \n \n83.  Limited Executing Agency Capacity. AZERSU and SAWMA are also the EAs for all \nother donor-funded projects. They lack the capacity to administer a large portfolio of existing \nmultimillion-dollar  projects.  Therefore,  implementation  is  likely  to  suffer  and  to  experience \ndelays. To mitigate this risk, the Investment Program includes program management facilities, \ncomprising  teams  of  international and  national  consultants,  who  will  provide  technical  and \nmanagement support to the EAs.  \n \n84.  Lack  of  Executing  Agency  Autonomy.  At  present,  AZERSU  and  SAWMA  are \nconstrained on making independent decisions on SuKana and JSC staffing; procurement of \nworks, goods, and services; and financial transactions. This may result in implementation delays \nand restrict much-needed capacity development of SuKanals and JSCs. The Government has \ncommitted to streamlining the approval process by allowing more autonomy to AZERSU and \nSAWMA for implementing the Investment Program.  \n \n85.  Lack of Beneficiary Participation. The EAs\u2019 inability to reach out to the community, \ncreate awareness, and elicit support may create customer dissatisfaction, lack of their support \nduring implementation, and hence delay implementation of the Investment Program. This risk is \nmitigated through a well-designed public outreach program that will ensure that beneficiaries are \neducated on the benefits and provide adequate support during implementation.  \n \n86.  Poor Maintenance of Assets after Completion. Lack of EAs\u2019 foresight and long-term \ncommitment to build SuKanal and JSC staff capacity on technical, financial, and administrative \nmatters is likely to affect the quality of service delivery. This risk is mitigated through program \nmanagement facility input and a twinning program designed to guide SuKanal and JSC staff in \nasset maintenance, financial management, and service delivery. \n \nV.  UNDERTAKINGS AND ASSURANCES \nA.  Undertakings \n87.  The Government has agreed to the following undertakings for the MFF which have been \nincorporated in the FFA: \n(i)  ensure timely implementation of the Investment Program, including (a) executing \nthe  implementing  arrangements  set  out  in  the  FFA;  (b)  making  available, \npromptly as needed, the funds, counterpart staff, facilities, and services that are \nrequired,  in  addition  to  the  proceeds  of  the  loans  under  the  MFF;  and  (c) \nmonitoring and evaluating implementation based on the design and monitoring \nframework set out in the FFA;  \n(ii)  ensure that all projects financed under the MFF are selected and approved in \naccordance with the criteria and procedure set out in the FFA;  \n(iii)  ensure that all projects financed under the MFF are developed, implemented, \nand maintained in accordance with the safeguard requirements set out in the \nFFA; \n(iv)  ensure that ADB is kept informed on policies and programs related to WSS \nservices and other policies and programs that will materially affect the financial \nviability of the projects under the Investment Program; \n(v)  in the event that there is (a) any change in ownership of the projects or facilities \nfinanced  under  the  MFF;  (b)  any  sale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  control  or \n ", "21 \ninterest in the projects or facilities; or (c) any change in the authority or function \nof AZERSU or SAWMA over the projects or facilities, ensure that ADB\u2019s consent \nis obtained at least 6 months prior to the implementation of the change and that \nany such change will be carried out in a legal and transparent manner;  \n(vi)  ensure that necessary and qualified staff for AZERSU, SAWMA, SuKanals, and \nJSCs are engaged for and beyond the duration of the Investment Program; \n(vii)  provide the necessary resources to ensure that the facilities established under \nthe Investment Program (a) are effective and sustainable for the delivery of WSS \nservices, and (b) will continue to be in good condition for and beyond the duration \nof the Investment Program; \n(viii)  ensure that poverty and social analyses are prepared for all tranches under the \nMFF and that adequate resources are provided for their implementation; \n(ix)  implement public consultation and participation plan comprising: (a) a community \nawareness and participation program; (b) a hygiene and sanitation program; and \n(c) a training program for TWUAs; \n(x)  implement the gender action plan prepared under the Investment Program to \nencourage gender-balanced consultation and participation in the planning and \nimplementation of the Investment Program;  \n(xi)  ensure that (a) there is no difference in payment of wages between men and \nwomen for work of equal value, and (b) civil works contractors do not employ \nchild labor in the construction and maintenance activities in accordance with \napplicable laws and regulations in Azerbaijan; \n(xii)  ensure  that  following  the  completion  of  civil  works  under  each  tranche  and \nimplementation of tariff measures, funds will be set aside on an annual basis in a \nspecial account for operation and maintenance expenditures (to achieve financial \nsustainability for such expenditures); and  \n(xiii)  ensure that SuKanals will be converted to JSCs within 12 months after the \ncompletion of civil works under each tranche. \n \nB.  Specific Assurances \n88.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, AZERSU, and SAWMA have \nagreed to the following specific assurances for the tranche 1 project and such assurances will \nbe incorporated in the loan agreement: \n(i)  ensure that recruitment of PMF consultants is completed within 1 month of loan \neffectiveness, and that AZERSU and SAWMA maintain the counterpart staff for \neach  PMO  with  the  minimum  of  a  program  manager  and/or  contract \nmanagement specialist, a financial management and/or disbursement specialist, \na WSS and/or monitoring and evaluation specialist, and a safeguard expert. \nFollowing project completion, these PMO staff may be integrated and become \npart of the staff of the relevant JSC; \n(ii)  ensure that the PSC and the PIRCs will be established within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness; \n(iii)  ensure that the JSCs participating in the tranche 1 project are adequately staffed, \nincluding through providing adequate staff resources to the JSCs; \n(iv)  ensure that the twinning program for AZERSU and SAWMA with an external \nWSS utility be finalized within 6 months of loan effectiveness; \n(v)  ensure that the time-bound action plans to be agreed with AZERSU, SAWMA, \nand JSCs during implementation of the tranche 1 project are strictly complied \nwith and monitored through PSC and PIRCs meetings to avoid implementation \ndelays; \n ", "22 \n(vi)  ensure that WSS tariffs are revised for customers receiving improved services \nand that the tariff increase will be set at appropriate levels, taking into account \nthe real costs of delivering the improved service. The Government will ensure \nthat the revised tariffs are implemented by AZERSU and SAWMA; \n(vii)  ensure  that  the  JSCs  have  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  for  effective \ncollection of service fees and penalizing defaulters, for deterring nonpayment and \nensuring sustainability of JSC operations; \n(viii)  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  for  the  tranche  1  project. \nHowever, if land acquisition or resettlement activity arises, the Government will \nensure that it will be carried out promptly and efficiently in accordance with \napplicable laws and regulations in Azerbaijan, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), and the land acquisition and resettlement framework; and \n(ix)  ensure that (a) the tranche 1 project is carried out in accordance with the project \ndesign, and construction and operations, and complies with applicable laws and \nregulations  in  Azerbaijan  and  ADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b)  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  is  applied  to  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy; (c) the environment management \nplans in the initial environment examinations are updated and made contract- \nand  site-specific  during  final  design;  (d)  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures  specified  in  the  environment  management  plans  are \nincorporated in the bidding documents to be released only after the relevant \nenvironmental assessment reports have been approved by ADB, and civil works \ncontractor\u2019s specifications include requirements to implement the environment \nmanagement  plans;  (e)  the  civil  works  contractors  are  closely  supervised  to \nensure  compliance;  and  (f)  the  design  supervision  consultants  undertake \nenvironmental monitoring, and reflect the results in the project progress reports \nand semiannual environmental monitoring reports submitted to ADB. \nC.

Such staff will comprise a program director, a financial management and/or \ndisbursement specialist, and a WSS and/or monitoring and evaluation specialist. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n90.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $600,000,000 (the facility amount) to the Republic of Azerbaijan for the \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Investment  Program  comprising  loans  not  exceeding \n$600,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n2 September 2009 \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nTable A1.1: Multitranche Financing Facility \n \nData Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved public health and  Public satisfaction with WSS  State Statistical Committee  Political and economic stability \nenvironment in Investment  availability, quality, and quantity is  reports  prevails. \nProgram towns  increased (to be quantified when     \nbaseline is established through a  Reports of multilateral and  Risk \nsocial survey at Investment  bilateral agencies  JSCs and SuKanals do not \nProgram inception).    maintain completed \n  Semiannual socioeconomic  infrastructure. \nPercentage of children under age 5  surveys undertaken as part \nyears suffering from diarrhea in last  of the PPMS \n30 days is reduced to less than   \n10% by 2017.

Sector Road Map \n1.  Overview of Sector Development Policy \n1.  In its state program on poverty reduction and sustainable development for 2006\u20132015,1  \nthe Government of Azerbaijan commits to improving access to basic services. Considering the \nimportance of safe water supply and sanitation (WSS), the state program targets improved WSS \ncoverage and service quality by 2015. This includes 100% coverage with 24-hour water supply \nin Baku and 80%\u201385% coverage in Azerbaijan\u2019s secondary towns and villages. Improved public \ninfrastructure, sustainable environmental management, and good governance and institutional \neffectiveness are also key strategic goals of the state program. \n2.  Directions to Achieve Strategic Goals \n2.  Improved Public Infrastructure. Main sources of funding for the state program include \nthe state budget, state social protection fund, oil fund, municipal budgets, and international \nfinancial  institutions.  Aligned  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  for  WSS,  the  state \nprogram emphasizes systematic improvements of WSS infrastructure through its investment \npolicy measures. To meet the ever-growing demand for water, the state program provides the \nfollowing guidelines:  \n(i)  Ensure that the potable water supply to the population conforms to international \nstandards.  \n(ii)  Encourage the overall development of the WSS sector with AZERSU taking \nactions to construct new facilities using state-guaranteed loans; completing the \nOghuz\u2013Gabala\u2013Baku  pipeline;  and  refurbishing  older  water  pipelines,  tanks, \npumping stations, distribution networks, in-building water systems, and sewage \ntreatment facilities in Baku. \n(iii)  Achieve 100% consumer fee collection for water provision over the state program \nperiod.  \n(iv)  Continue ongoing restructuring works to attract greater investment in the WSS \nsector,  and  ensure  uninterrupted  service  corresponding  to  international \nstandards. \n(v)  Engage  the  private  sector  and  municipalities  in  creating  infrastructure  and \ndelivering services. \n \n3.  Sustainable Environmental Management. The state program provides directions to \nresolve environmental deterioration and improve its management. Priority directions include (i) \nsustainable  management  of  water  resources;  (ii)  comprehensive  waste  management;  (iii) \nimprovement  of  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  monitoring  systems,  and  environmental \nmanagement resources; and (iv) increasing environmental education and awareness. \n \n4.  On  gender  development,  the  state  program  states  that  empowering  women  and \nreducing gender inequality is not only a goal, but also a tool of economic development and \npoverty reduction. Therefore, in all sectors, attention has been paid to the way in which the state \nprogram affects the rights and opportunities of both men and women. \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Azerbaijan. 2008. State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development for 2006\u2013\n2015 Baku. \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \n5.  The multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Water Supply and Sanitation Investment \nProgram (the Investment Program) affords the scope for a programmatic, long-term approach to \nthe development of basic urban infrastructure in Azerbaijan\u2019s secondary towns guided by road \nmaps for critical sector and institutional reforms. Notably, the MFF modality (i) establishes the \nfoundation for an 8-year partnership between the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),  (ii)  combines  interrelated  physical  and  nonphysical  investments,  (iii)  allows  for \ninvestments to be sequenced, and (iv) is supported by a sector road and policy framework. \n3.  Developmental Challenges  \n6.  Growth and Poverty Reduction. Azerbaijan is one of fastest growing economies in the \nworld. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 20.2% in 2004\u20132008, supported by \nsurging crude oil production and exports. The gross national product per capita rose to $6,142 \nin 2008 from $390 per capita in 1995. This rapid growth is mainly attributed to developments in \nthe oil industry, which accounts for almost one third of Azerbaijan\u2019s GDP. Oil sector growth \nspurred growth in transport, communications, and services. On the production side, growth was \nled by construction, services, and agriculture. Construction output expanded by 12% in 2008 \nlargely in secondary towns and rural areas, residential and office centers across the country, \nand transport. Non-oil GDP grew at almost 16% in 2008, the highest rate of growth in the past 5 \nyears.  \n \n7.  Unsurprisingly,  Azerbaijan\u2019s  growth  prospects  are  closely  linked  to  oil  prices.  GDP \ngrowth is projected to fall to 8.0% in 2009 and further to 6.7% in 2010, reflecting relatively \nmodest growth in the hydrocarbon sector. Growth in crude oil and natural gas exports will also \nslow. With foreign investments declining in the oil sector, public investment will become the \nsingle largest  source  of  growth  over  the  medium  term,  accounting for  about  60%  of  total \ninvestments.  In  2009,  public  spending  expansion  will  moderate  to  around  15%  versus  an \naverage of 65% in the past 3 years. Of concern is the likelihood that direct transfers from the \nState Oil Fund of Azerbaijan Republic will become the key source revenues for the state budget \nin 2009, and it is likely that this fund will be the largest nontax contributor for annual budgetary \nexpenditure.  \n \n8.  The Government seeks to build upon the opportunities provided by its oil revenue, as \nwell as to put in place measures that will ensure growth in the non-oil economy to ensure that \nthe full benefits of economic growth reach all sectors and segments of society. Although it will \nreduce fiscal spending over the medium term, the Government will expand capital investment \nmoderately and restructure expenditures in the basic urban and social sectors.  \n \n9.  Poverty levels have declined from an estimated 49% of the country\u2019s population in 2001 \nto about 13.2% in 2009. Poverty is higher in urban areas. Baku has the highest number of poor \npeople, but secondary towns have higher incidences of poverty. Rural areas and small towns \nsuffer the most from unreliable supplies of energy, water, and gas, and they often lack access to \nbasic education and health services. The existing WSS services have seriously impaired the \npoor as (i) they spend more time collecting mostly unsafe water at the expense of working; and \n(ii) they must obtain smaller quantities of water from vendors, often paying 10 times above what \nhigh-income households pay.  \n \n10.  Technical State of Sector Assets. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the \nquality and efficiency of water service delivery declined in Azerbaijan due to poor management \nand inadequate investment. The existing WSS systems are over 50 years old. Water supply \nsources are in a poor state of repair, and other modes of supply (e.g., through private vendors) \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nare expensive and/or unreliable. Water treatment facilities in many secondary towns are either \nabsent  or  largely  dysfunctional,  and  distribution  networks  are  inappropriately  sized  and \ndilapidated. Despite  an  83%  piped-network  coverage  in  secondary  towns,  the  majority  of \nresidents  do  not  have  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Unaccounted-for  water  is  difficult  to \nestimate, because there have been no realistic assessments. Engineering drawings of the \ndistribution systems are rare, which make maintenance and repairs difficult. Service levels vary \nfrom town to town. The latest municipal services survey2 carried out across the country in 2003 \nrevealed that at least 81% of urban households and over 90% of the households in major cities \nhad house water connections. In smaller secondary towns, more than 75% households relied on \nwells and private water vendors. \n \n11.  The sewerage system is in even worse condition. Only 55% of Azerbaijan\u2019s population \nhas access to improved sanitation facilities. Access in urban areas is higher than in rural areas, \nwith coverage estimated at 73% and 36%, respectively.3 The sewage network in Baku serves \nabout 78% of the population,4 while sewage coverage in other urban areas is about 32%. Pipes \nare broken or clogged with silt and debris, and wastewater is discharged into ditches or the \nnearest watercourses. Poor sanitation and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and \nenvironmental hazards.  \n \n12.  Level and Quality of Sector Services. Water supply is intermittent and of limited \nquantity. The water quality is poor, with high levels of silt. Many consumers buy water from \nprivate vendors to augment their supply. Sewerage systems are failing, and pipes are clogged \nand broken. During heavy rains, raw sewage floods the streets and house compounds, and \nexisting treatment facilities do not operate. River pollution increases, and stagnant sewage \nthreatens health conditions. Data on drinking water quality in Azerbaijan are scant due to \ninadequate  monitoring  and  record-keeping  practices.  While  some  reports  indicate  that \nwaterborne  diseases,  such  as  bacterial  dysentery,  parasitic  infections,  typhoid,  and  viral \nhepatitis,  spread  in  Azerbaijan  during  the  1990s,  official  health  statistics  indicate  that  the \nincidence of these diseases is declining. \n \n13.   Financial Aspects of Sector Services. The current financial performance of SuKanals \n(town WSS agencies) and joint stock companies (JSCs) is poor. Although SuKanals and JSCs \nare self-financing agencies in principle, they are unable to recover tariffs directly due to the poor \ncondition of infrastructure and related services. For nonroutine repairs, SuKanals and JSCs rely \non additional funds from AZERSU, which are not always forthcoming. Moreover, operating \nrevenues from tariffs are inadequate to undertake proper operation and maintenance, leading to \nthe continued deterioration of WSS systems. Tariffs are low, and customers resist paying water \nbills  due  to  poor  service.  Billing  and  recording  of  outstanding  amounts  are  not  properly \nmanaged. The absence of residential and bulk water metering not only makes it impossible to \nmeasure consumption and to establish suitable tariffs, but also reduces incentives for demand \nmanagement. The current method of door-to-door payment collection also compromises the \nSuKanals and JSCs' ability to monitor payment. \n14.  Administrative Structure. Until 2004, the WSS sector comprised (i) the Greater Baku \nand the Apsheron peninsula, served by the JSC Apsheron Regional Water Company; and (ii) all \nurban and rural communities outside the Apsheron peninsula, served by the Azersukanaltemir \nProduction Union (AzerSuKanal), a department within the State Committee for Construction and \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2003. Azerbaijan Municipal Services Study. Washington, DC. \n3  2004 data. World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators 2004. Washington, DC. \n4  The United Nations Environmental Performance Review, 2004 gives sewage coverage in Baku as 72%.  \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nArchitecture. In June 2004, Presidential Decree No. 252 liquidated AzerSuKanal and transferred \nits functions and assets to the JSC Azersu (formerly JSC Apsheron Regional Water Company). \n15.  AzerSuKanal  had  51  local  branches  (water  and  wastewater  enterprises,  known  as \nSuKanals) to provide WSS services in provincial towns and other residential areas. Under \nPresidential Decree No. 252, AZERSU now manages all SuKanals and JSCs,5 coordinates their \nactivities, and prepares proposals on implementing state policy to improve WSS systems. The \nexception is the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which is overseen by the State Amelioration \nand Water Management Agency (SAWMA). \n4.  Policy Framework \n16.  Rationale  for  Sector  Investment.  The  Government  and  international  financial \ninstitutions have identified deterioration in physical condition of WSS infrastructure and the \nprovision of wastewater and fecal sludge treatment facilities as key interventions to address \nimprovements  in  the  provision  of  WSS  services.  Assessment  of  the  country's  economic \nperformance indicates that production growth was led by construction (36% growth in 2007\u2013\n2008), indicating development of secondary town and rural infrastructure along with residential \nand commercial building construction. However, investigations during design and construction \nof existing projects indicate that a substantial level of investment is required to meet the targets \nindicated in the state program and its strategic goals (footnote 1). Overriding the infrastructure \nneed is the requirement to ensure that investments are environmentally sustainable and that \ngood governance practices are adopted to improve levels of service delivery. \n \n17.  Strategic Vision. The strategic vision of the road map is to improve the availability, \nquality, reliability, and sustainability of WSS services in Azerbaijan\u2019s rayon (regional) centers \nand settlements surrounding Baku. The road map will comprehensively address the objectives \nof the following key strategic documents: (i) the ongoing country partnership strategy, and (ii) \nthe state program. \n \n18.  The Investment Program will improve the quality and coverage of urban services in \nsecondary towns, peri-urban areas surrounding Baku, and other centers in the country. Physical \noutputs will include (i) increased water supply coverage, increased number of connections to \npiped  networks,  and  reduced  system  leaks  to  ensure  24-hour  supply  of  pressurized,  safe \ndrinking  water;  and  (ii)  increased  wastewater  disposal  and  treatment.  It  will  benefit \napproximately 500,000 residents.  \n \n19.  Main  Challenges  and  Operating  Conditions.  The  WSS  sector  is  faced  with  the \nfollowing developmental challenges: (i) ability to ensure infrastructure or asset creation on \nschedule  based  on  limited  construction  capacity  in  the  country;  (ii)  lack  of  skilled  staff  in \nSuKanals and JSCs to maintain WSS systems, especially wastewater treatment plants; (iii) \nability to increase tariffs progressively and to overcome shortfalls in operation and maintenance \ncosts to achieve financial sustainability; (iv) ability to ensure environmental sustainability of \ninvestments; (v) ability to develop staff capacity of SuKanals and JSCs to plan, design, and \nmanage  WSS  services;  and  (vi)  ability  to  institute  good  governance  practices  (e.g., \nmanagement information systems, prudent financial management and accounting practices, \nand  human  resource  development)  in  service  delivery.  Overcoming  these  challenges  is \ncontingent on the reform agenda adopted by the executing agencies\u2014Azersu and SAWMA\u2014\n                                                 \n5  In Agdash, Ganja, Goychay, and Sheki, WSS operations are currently being carried out under separate JSCs\u2014 \nsubsidiary companies of Azersu formed under projects financed by ADB and German development cooperation \nthrough KfW. \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \nand their action plan to progressively improve the environmental, institutional, and financial \nsustainability of WSS services. \n \n20.  Reform Agenda. The WSS sector's reform agenda will (i) ensure service sustainability \nthrough institutional and managerial reforms; (ii) improve efficiencies in service delivery through \nstrengthened management measures, introducing performance-based service contracts, and \nmanaging scales of operations by clustering local governments where possible; (iii) improve \nsystem accountability through better information flow, decentralized systems, and benchmarking \ncosts and performance; and (iv) improve financial management through revenue enhancement \nmeasures, budget prioritization, and asset and liability management. \n \n21.  A set of sequenced reform actions and sector investments will bring improvements in \nservice delivery. The Investment Program responds to these needs by adopting a long-term and \nholistic  approach  improving  institutions,  capacities  and  systems,  and  service  delivery.  The \nInvestment Program will finance instruments targeting (i) institutional improvements for WSS \nservice  delivery;  (ii)  capacity  development  for  better  system  planning,  operation,  and \nmaintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  through  metering,  billing,  and  collecting  tariffs; \n(iv) increased efficiency for timely processing of effective WSS projects; (v) asset management; \n(vi) introducing a performance benchmarking system; and (vii) a twinning arrangement with an \nexternal WSS utility to support capacity development. The Investment Program also includes \nprogram management support to help with (i) gender, safeguards, governance, legal, financial, \nand administrative matters; (ii) design works for subsequent tranches; and (iii) general training \nand development.  \nB.  Investment Program \n1.  Sector Investment Need \n22.  Based on WSS priorities set in the state program, Azerbaijan\u2019s WSS sector needs $3.5 \nbillion  in  investment  by  2015.  Out  of  this,  $1.235  billion  has  already  been  committed  by \ninternational financial institutions and the Government (Table A2.1), and the remaining $2.310 \nbillion is to be mobilized through additional international financial institution funding and the \nGovernment's  own  resources  (Table  A2.2).  The  total  investments  include  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  management  interventions  to  ensure  the  sector's  technical  and  financial \nsustainability.  \n \nTable A2.1: Azerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Investments Committed by \nInternational Financial Institutions and the Government \n ($ million) \n  International Financial Institution   Towns   Project  Loan  Grant  Gov\u2019t \n1  ADB \u2013 1        3      39.90      30.00        -      9.90  \n2  KfW + SECO        2      71.37     48.49    13.00      9.88  \n3  World Bank - 1       22     310.00     230.00        -     80.00  \n4  World Bank - 2       21     410.00     260.00        -     150.00  \n5  JBIC       10     320.00     272.00        -     48.00  \n6  Natexis Banques Popularies         1      84.00      51.80        -     32.20  \n  Total       59    1,235.27     892.29     13.00     329.98  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; JBIC = Japan Bank for International Cooperation; SECO = Swiss Economic \nCooperation Agency.  \nSource: Azersu Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency (Nakhchivan) estimates. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.2: Azerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nRemaining Investment Needs by Component \n($ million) \nSector  Cost  % \nWater Supply     809    35 \nSanitation   1,455    63 \nInstitutional Development and Capacity Building a      46     2 \nTotal    2,310    100 \na Includes program management and survey and investigations cost estimates. \nSource: Azersu Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency (Nakhchivan) estimates. \n \n23.

Investment Program Components. The Investment Program has three components: (i) \nconstructing water supply and sanitation (WSS) infrastructure to boost service coverage, quality, \nand reliability (component A); (ii) developing institutional effectiveness, including management \nand governance (component B); and (iii) instituting program management facilities to oversee \nprogram implementation and treatment of technical requirements such as those for environment \nand social safeguards and gender mainstreaming (component C). The Investment Program will \nmeet about 35% of the total investment needs of $2.310 billion (Table A2.3).

Objectives. The following discussions present the economic viability analysis of two \noperational joint stock companies involved in two subprojects under the tranche 1 project of the \nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  These  two \nsubprojects were considered for the range of supply sources, population coverage, and system \noperation and maintenance in the areas where they operate. \n \n2.  Methodology.  The  economic  analysis  follows  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nguidelines, including the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects1 and Handbook for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects.2 The  analysis  describes  the  economic \nrationale and target beneficiaries and undertakes a viability analysis of the two subprojects. \nBased on sector review, demand analysis, and subproject beneficiary assessment, economic \nbenefit\u2013cost and sensitivity analyses were carried out. The economic benefit\u2013cost analysis \ncompares the calculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) with the economic opportunity \ncost  of  capital  (EOCC),  assumed  to  be  12%.  With  an  EIRR  greater  than  an  EOCC,  the \nsubproject proposal is deemed economically feasible. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to \nsee the effects of certain adverse conditions on system capital investment and operation and \nmaintenance costs, revenue generation, and overall subproject viability. The analysis uses the \ndomestic price numeraire, as benefits are nontradable in nature. The analysis was undertaken \nat constant mid-2008 price levels and assesses the subproject effects over a 30-year period. \n \n3.  Economic Rationale and Goals. The subproject rationale results from the increasing \nconcern over the deteriorating water supply and sanitation (WSS) conditions in towns and \ncommunities, mainly resulting from insufficient funds and system  mismanagement. Without \nurgent investments to pursue the long-term objective of providing sufficient and secure WSS \nservices, negative impacts on the health of the poor and their economic condition would only \ntend to nullify any limited effort already undertaken. The Investment Program is considered high \npriority by the Government of Azerbaijan and is well integrated with other investment planning \nactivities in the sector. \n \n4.  Selection Approach. The subprojects were selected based on the sector development \nplan and road map for the Investment Program (Appendix 2).3 The selection process required (i) \nconsistency with demand, based on community willingness to participate and contribute; (ii) \nleast-cost  approach  of  meeting  effective  demand  in  terms  of  location,  scale,  scope,  and \nappropriate technology; and (iii) economic benefits to exceed economic costs. Preference was \nalso given to communities with higher water-related health risks and to multiple communities \nserved by single integrated systems. \n \n5.  Project Components. The tranche 1 project focuses on the secure and sustainable \nsupply of good-quality potable water to the towns of Goychay and Nakhchivan. The physical \nworks comprise WSS networks. The local distribution network will include metered connections. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Economic  Costs.  The  economic  capital  investment  and  annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs have been calculated from the financial cost estimates given in Appendix 9. \nTaxes and duties are excluded from the financial costs as they represent transfer payments. \nPrice inflation and market distortions are also excluded. The subproject capital and operation \nand maintenance costs are distributed into traded and nontraded components and labor. For \ntraded and nontraded components, the shadow exchange rate factor is assumed at 1.02 based \non previous and ongoing projects by the ADB and the World Bank in Azerbaijan. Unskilled labor \nis available in the secondary town, which means the opportunity cost is lower than the wage \nrate. The shadow wage rate is assumed at 0.8 for unskilled labor, following estimates made for \nagricultural and highway projects in the regions.

Water  Supply  Situation.  Prior  to  and  without  the  tranche  1  project,  over  50%  of \nhouseholds in the subproject towns relied on alternative water either through tankers, bottled, \ncollected, or pumped from distant irrigation canals, springs, and rivers. With the tranche 1 \nproject, piped water will replace all alternative supplies from these sources, which will now \ncomprise nonincremental demand. The existing water systems in the two subprojects have \nrecently undergone improvement since initial investment to increase supply coverage to about \n80%  in  the  central  districts,  but  large  areas  outside  the  town  centers  are  yet  to  see \ndevelopment. However, low-quality supplies still afflict served and unserved populations. The \nsupply situation is projected to rise with the population growth rate and to increase annually to \nreach the design target population served at 90% by 2013 (year 5). \n \n9.  Existing demand averages 150\u2013200 liters per capita per day for house connections. \nDemand is based on existing reports and actual survey, and is assumed to improve with the \nsubprojects in place. In the selected program towns, households without connections could \nspend about 2\u20134 hours daily covering a distance of 500\u20131,500 meters to collect water from \nunsafe  sources,  such  as  open  irrigation  canals  and  unprotected  surface  water.  Poor \nmaintenance of the existing piped systems\u2014due to lack of funds resulting from inadequate \ntariffs and low collection rates\u2014has also led connected households to supplement their current \nneeds in the same manner, with some reverting to the more expensive supplies from delivery \ntankers and other vendors. However, with available supplies mitigated through the financial \noperational plans outlined in the financial analysis (Appendix 9), current demand levels are \nexpected be met. In more developed sections of the program towns, there are consumers who \nexceed design demand levels, and have the capacity and willingness to pay for the excess. This \ninduced demand arises with the lower price offered with the piped service. However, if tariffs are \nmaintained at current levels, the situation leads to the depletion of supply sources earlier than \n ", "50  Appendix 8 \nthe projected design horizon at 24 years, or by 2033. In this instance, sufficient funds will have \nbeen generated from the improved financial operations to finance development of additional \nsupplies to augment increased demand. Financial projections indicate that with proposed tariff \nincreases and viability gap fund, sufficient surpluses are generated over time to finance capital \ninvestments either directly or by leveraging surpluses for debt. Table A8.3 presents the current \nand future demand situation in the two sample subprojects. For purposes of the analysis, year 0 \n(2008) is taken to represent the without-project situation, for although the systems are partially \noperational, any reported improvements to the system and service prior to project interventions \nremain insignificant. The first year of full or improved system operation\u2014when all facilities \nincluding financial operational reform plans are established\u2014is placed toward the end of year 4 \n(2012) or early in year 5 (2013). \n \n10.  Subproject  Beneficiaries.  Subproject  beneficiaries  comprise  domestic  and \nnondomestic users with existing connections and those who are yet to avail of connections but \npreviously obtained water from alternative sources. Beneficiaries also include households that \nwill  continue  to  depend  on  alternative  sources  as  main  supply  sources  for  economic  and \ntechnical reasons. In Goychay, the number of beneficiaries is seen to rise by 39% by year 25 \n(2033) from the without-project situation, and in Nakhchivan, by 25% in the same period.

Economic Benefits for Water Supply. The main benefits would arise from resource \ncost savings and from incremental water demand: \n(i)  There will be incremental benefits that accrue from induced demand\u2014estimated \nat 15%\u201320% of total projected demand\u2014due to lower costs associated with \npiped service from the tranche 1 project. The with- and without-project scenarios \nare evaluated to determine the benefits effects.  \n(ii)  The  benefits  are  quantified  based  on  cost  savings  or  avoided  costs  for \nnonincremental  water  supply.  The  cost  of  time  used  for  collecting  water  is \nestimated at 50% of the average hourly wage rate in the area and using average \ndistance and collection time. This is multiplied by the shadow wage rate at 0.8 \nand  the  number  of  hours  spent  annually  on  water  collection.  To  this,  the \npurchase cost for in-house storage, maintenance, and water supply treatment \n(i.e., boiling and filtration) is added. These benefits account for the costs that \nhouseholds would have incurred in the without-project situation. The total cost to \nthe household is then divided by the total water consumption, to arrive at the \nnonincremental benefit per unit consumption (in $ per cubic meter).  \n(iii)  Existing  supplemental  supplies  through  water  vendors  and  tankers  will  be \nreplaced by the new piped system and also form part of nonincremental inputs. \nThe price of delivered water is estimated at $10\u2013$20 per month per household. \nOver 50% of subproject town population rely on this service. Bottled water users \nthat make up 1%\u20133% of the population pay as much as $1.50 per day.  \n(iv)  Induced demand would comprise incremental benefits, which are valued using \nthe  average  willingness-to-pay-based  actual  survey  conducted  in  the  areas \nduring project preparation, and the long-run marginal cost proxied by the average \nincremental economic cost in the analysis.  \n(v)  There are no benefits assumed from nontechnical loss, such as pilferage, meter \ntampering,  and  illegal connections,  as these occurrences  are  atypical  in  the \nsubproject communities. \n \n12.  Economic Benefits for Sanitation. Economic analysis for this program part cannot be \npractically  undertaken  due  to  difficulty  in  monetizing  the  expected  benefits  from  the \nimprovement of sewage and on-site sanitation facilities. One baseline indicator on sanitation\u2014\nhouseholds\u2019 willingness to pay a premium for sewer connection versus the expenditure being \nincurred  for  on-site  sanitation  systems\u2014reveal  only  about  a  50%  premium.  This  means \nsubstantial investments in sewerage would be difficult to justify in economic terms if only private \nbenefits  are  taken  into  account.  There  will  be  public  benefits  for  both  community  and \nenvironment  that  need  to  be  carefully  assessed  from  a  qualitative  standpoint  given  the \nchallenge associated with sanitation benefits quantitative analysis. Some key benefits that do \nnot lend to quantitative analysis due to lack of information include (i) long-run marginal cost \nsavings, (ii) increase in property values, (iii) health impact, and (iv) impact on the environment. \n \n13.  Economic Benefit\u2013Cost Analysis. The main economic costs evaluated in the analysis \ncomprise  capital  investment  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  The  major  economic \nbenefits include nonincremental water assessed using a resource cost-savings approach. The \nannual cost streams are set against the annual benefit streams and discounted using the EOCC \nat 12% as the hurdle rate. The resulting present value of benefits is divided by the present value \nof costs, and\u2014if the resulting ratio is greater than or equal to 1.0\u2014the subproject is deemed \nacceptable.

Following ADB guidelines, the EOCC is set at 12%. The results show base case \nEIRR exceeding the EOCC. The average EIRR is at 19.4%.

Likewise, switching values \nare applied to the cost and benefit parameters. For Nakhchivan, economic returns are generally \nrobust,  except  for  increased  capital  cost  and  lower  benefits-generation  scenarios.  The \nsubproject in Goychay results in positive returns in all scenarios.

The  tranche  1  project  under  the  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Investment Program (the Investment Program) will cover subprojects in Goychay and \nNakhchivan. In these towns, the existing water supply and sanitation system is over 50 years \nold. Water supply sources are in a poor state of repair, and water treatment facilities are largely \ndysfunctional. The sewage system is in even worse condition. Pipes are broken or clogged \nwith silt and debris, and wastewater is discharged into ditches or the nearest watercourses. \nPoor sanitation and leaking sewers are creating serious health risks and environmental hazards. \nSewerage connections are only 25%. Presently, the population served by the existing water \nsupply system in the two towns is reportedly 80%. However, the majority of residents do not \nhave  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  Further,  low  water  supply  and  sanitation  tariffs  and \ncollection efficiency, due to poor services, have aggravated the situation as profits are barely \nsufficient to cover recurrent costs, let alone asset replacement. \n \n2.  A review of the finances of joint stock companies (JSCs) operating in these towns \nindicates the need to set up a financial operational plan to help ensure the sustainability of all \nthe subprojects undertaken through the Investment Program. The approach to the analysis, \nassumptions, and conclusion are discussed in the following sections. \n \n3.  Methodology. The two subprojects were analyzed following ADB's Handbook for the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects1 and  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.2 The  financial  analysis  assesses  the  ability  of  the  subprojects  to  meet  capital \nexpenditure,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  if  appropriate,  debt  servicing  and \ndepreciation or reinvestment margins. \n \n4.  The analysis is conducted on a with- and without-project basis by estimating incremental \ncosts and revenues over a 25-year period. The main financial viability parameters analyzed are \n(i) the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), which must be greater than the weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC), with the financial net present value as proxy; (ii) operating ratio, which \nmust be less than or equal to unity when the subproject is fully operational; and (iii) tariff \naffordability, which is normally acceptable at a maximum of 5% of the average household \nincome. Details of the analysis are presented in the Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.  The analysis looks closely at the operating ratio as the main indicator of sustainability, \nwhere operation and maintenance, depreciation, and interest expenses are measured against \ntariff  revenues.  A  ratio  at  less  than  unity  reflects  cost  recovery,  thus  a  certain  level  of \nsustainability; at greater than unity, the lack thereof, thus the need to increase tariffs or to obtain \nsubsidies. This practice had been confirmed in a previous study on the sector.3 \n \n6.  Assumptions. The key assumptions used are (i) investment costs at base January \n2008 prices; (ii) physical contingencies at 10%; (iii) local inflation at 13.7% in 2009, 10% in \n2010, 8.6% in 2011, 7.7% in 2012, 7.5% in 2013, 7% in 2014, and onward; (iv) foreign inflation \nat 2.5% annually; (v) operation and maintenance costs covering salaries, chemicals, power, \nrepair and maintenance, and bad debts allowance based on historical operations and on design \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Under-reporting of sales and revenues is prompted by the levy of 5 \nAzM/m3 by Head Office.\u201d ADB. 2001. Urban Water Supply and Sanitation in Secondary Towns.

Revenues are projected from domestic and nondomestic demand for water and sewage \nservices, and tariffs programmed to increase every 2 years. As the basis for calculating existing \ntariffs is difficult to verify, the required initial increase at subproject completion by 2012 (year \n4)\u2014which could be substantial\u2014has been determined based on user affordability and targeted \ncost recovery levels, including (i) operation and maintenance cost coverage, (ii) operation and \nmaintenance cost plus depreciation coverage, and (iii) operation and maintenance cost plus \ndepreciation and loan interest coverage. Where tariffs exceed maximum affordability, subsidy \nneeds have been estimated. A \u201csoft\u201d pre-project tariff increase of 25% is likewise proposed by \n2010 (year 2). The increases and assessed subsidies will form part of the financial reform \noperational plan. \n \n8.  The analysis is based on the design demand of about 150 liters per capita per day for \ndomestic connection, increasing to 200 liters per capita per day when the system becomes fully \noperational  by  the  end  of  2012.  Nondomestic  demand  is  at  20%  of  domestic  demand. \nWastewater generation is at 70% of total water demand. \n \n9.  The demand forecast assumes all water from existing alternative sources, i.e., through \ntankers, bottled, collected from point source, or pumped, will be replaced from the subproject \nwater  supply.  This  is  featured  as  nonincremental  water  in  the  economic  analysis.  System \nimprovements  with-project  will  curb  unaccounted-for  water  from  current  levels  of  about  \n30%\u201340% upon project completion, and further to 20% within 2 years hence, to make billable \nwater available to the system, thereby improving the cost recovery perspective.

Operation  and  Maintenance  Costs.  Subproject  operation  and  maintenance  costs \ninclude  JSC  staff  salaries,  power  and  energy,  chemical  treatment,  maintenance,  and \nmiscellaneous expenses, and are based on SuKanal (town WSS agency) historical financial \noperations. Bad debt expense is assumed at 1% of sales. Escalation is applied based on local \ninflation. Depreciation is assumed at 2% annually (50-year items) for civil works and 6.7%\u2013\n10.0% (10- to 15-year items) for replacement materials and equipment. Replacement of fully \ndepreciated assets is assumed to be financed through internal cash. \n \n15.  Cost-Recovery Analysis. Tariffs are established by dividing all cash requirements plus \nmargins by the combined volume of water sold and wastewater generated. It is projected that \nthe collection rate would improve as services improve. In the analysis, the actual collection rate \nof about 60% for Goychay and Nakhchivan is expected to reach 90% by 2012 (year 4). The \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \nanalysis determines the level of tariffs required to satisfy various cost-recovery options. The \nrequired subsidy levels have been assessed in the form of a viability gap fund where tariffs are \ninsufficient to attain full cost recovery. \n \n16.  Current Tariffs. Tariffs follow current practice that differentiates tariffs for domestic and \nnondomestic use. All tariffs are volumetric and thus structured to prevent waste. However, \nmetering  is  very  limited,  with  coverage  averaging  less  than  30%  of  total  services.  Where \nmetering is available, wear and disrepair have made the equipment unreliable, and complete \nreplacement is recommended and budgeted under the subproject capital investment. House \nconnections for combined water and sewage services are presently charged, on average, $0.14 \nper cubic meter in the two towns. Commercial and industrial connections are charged about 5 \ntimes that at $0.72 per cubic meter. A service charge for bulk quantity water used as production \nraw  material  is  at  $25.76  per  cubic  meter.  The  existing  structure,  although  allowing  for  \ncross-subsidization among connection types, does not necessarily target the poor.  \n \n17.  Tariff Basis and Forecast. In the financial projections, where costs are given in nominal \nterms, the tariffs are projected to increase biennially to cope with cost inflation. The projected \nincreases should be considered in planning financial reforms. In the FIRR cash flows, the tariffs \nare taken in real terms. It is proposed to include tariff restructuring as part of financial reforms \nwhere the poor, who have lower disposable incomes, would be able to at least cover their basic \nwater needs (e.g., 40 liters per capita per day or 3\u20135 cubic meters per month). Higher-income \nhouseholds, generally requiring more water and consequently incurring higher marginal costs, \nwould be made to pay more. Commercial and industrial charges may be revisited so more \nappropriate levies are designed to encourage on-time payment. As backyard gardening and \nlimited  livestock  raising  are  commonly  practiced,  particularly  in  the  subproject  area, \nconsumption for such purposes may be attached to tariffs to be established for public stand \nposts. \n \n18.  Affordability Analysis. An affordability analysis was undertaken to check the level of \nwater expenditure against the average household income. Table A9.4 presents the affordability \nlevels in each subproject for year 1 (2009), year 5 (2013), year 10 (2018), and year 25 (2033). \nThe number of persons\u2014an average of 5.0 per household\u2014and unit consumption\u201490 liters per \ncapita per day in 2009\u2014are based on field surveys and actual operational reports. The average \nhousehold incomes are based on social surveys conducted in the subproject towns during \nproject preparation and adjusted to price inflation. \n \nTable A9.4: Tariff Affordability  \nAverage Subproject Goychay Subproject Nakchivan\nParticulars Yr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10 Yr 25 Yr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10  Yr 25 Yr 1 Yr 5 Yr 10 Yr 25\nPersons per household 4.9 4.9 4.9 4.9   5 .1   5 .1     5 .1       5 .1 4.7 4.7 4.7 4.7\nConsumption, lpcd   1 15    140    1 60 160 140 140 160 160 90 140 160 160\nAverage consumption/mo, m3 17 21 24 24 21 21 24 24 13 20 23 23\nAverage HH income/mo, $ 740 846 1,029 1,853 805 846 1,029 1,853 674 846 1,029 1,853\nAverage HH Bill/mo, $  3 .26   4.32  16.20 122.93 4 .72  4.72  20.08  179.63 1.80 3.93 12.32 66.23\nIncome spent for water (%)a 0.4 0.5 1.6 6.6% 1 1 2 10 0 0 1 4\n \nlpcd = liters per capita per day; m3 = cubic meter \na Tariffs are deemed affordable at about 5% of average household income.

Based on the analysis, tariff increases for subproject Goychay, which are required to \nsatisfy viability parameters, will eventually exceed consumer affordability, specifically during the \nfirst 5\u20137 years of debt payments (Supplementary Appendix C). During such periods, subsidies \n(i.e., viability gap funding) will need to be considered. Table A9.4 indicates that the monthly \ncharge for Goychay exceeding the generally accepted limit of 5% of household income in year \n25 (2033). This is not likely to happen in Nakhchivan, where income spent for water is below the \nlimit throughout the study period. The main factor for the difference is the larger customer base \nin Nakhchivan relative to the system type, which is also cheaper to operate. In future selection \nof subprojects under the Investment Program, due consideration to such technical factors will be \nemphasized. Additionally, while the Investment Program will account for meter installation in the \ncapital cost, the amount will be recovered from consumers over a 1-year period through tariffs. \nThe subsidization by way of deferred payment is to ensure that the cost is not an upfront load \non household income, consumers eventually own the meters, and working condition is ensured. \n \n20.  Table A9.5 presents the optimum biennial tariff increases needed to attain financial \nsustainability at the defined cost recovery levels. Tariff increases every 2 years are required to \nattain this optimum level of self-sufficiency. However, to attain full financial viability, subsidies \nare required to soften the tariff burden on users. To minimize operational subsidy needs, tariffs \nmay  be  further  increased  by  larger  and  more  frequent  increments.  However,  consumer \naffordability may be compromised, as in Goychay, where the projected tariffs will go beyond the \ngenerally accepted limit of 5% as early as year 16 (2024). However, over the project period \n(2009\u20132029),  Goychay  will  average  4.1%  and  Nakhchivan  1.9%\u2014both  well  within  the  5% \nconsumer affordability limit. \n \nTable A9.5: Optimum Biennial Cost Recovery Tariff Increases \n(%) \nSubproject   Subproject \n Level   Cost Recovery  Average  Goychay  Nakchivan \nI  O&M Cost  24 25 22\nII  O&M Cost + Depreciation 48 55 40\nIII O&M Cost + Depreciation + Debt 48 55 40\nO&M = operation and maintenance \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n21.  Financial Viability Approach. The subproject is considered viable if the resulting FIRR \nis  greater  than  the  WACC,  and  cost  recovery  tariffs  are  within  consumer  affordability. \nAdditionally, the operating ratio must be maintained lower than unity throughout the project \nperiod to ensure sustainability. Initial spreadsheet iterations reveal that without the subproject \nimprovements,  JSC  operations  will  not  be  sustainable,  with  operation  and  maintenance \nexpenditures exceeding tariff revenues. To satisfy all viability and sustainability parameters, \ntariffs must be subsidized until the end of the project through viability gap funding. Spreadsheet \niterations were run to determine the operating ratio with-project. Subsidies are still required \nduring the initial years of operation immediately after subproject construction, and about 5\u20137 \nyears (around 2013\u20132019) into the debt payments schedule. Figure A9.2 shows operating ratios \nin  the  without-  and  with-project  situations  at  full  cost  recovery,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance, depreciation, and debt. The revenue surplus built over time (and beyond the  \n10-year period for viability gap financing) will allow the JSCs to invest in capital expenditure and \nasset creation either directly or by leveraging the surplus for debt financing. \n \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \n \nFigure A9.2: Operating Ratio Without and With Project\n3.00\n2.50\no\nati 2.00\nR\ng \nn 1.50\nati\nper 1.00\nO\n0.50\n-\n9 1 3 5 7 9 1 3 5 7 9\n0 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nGoychay Without Nakhchivan Without\nGoychay With Nakhchivan With\n \n                                  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  To maintain an operating ratio of unity from 2009 to 2019, a viability gap fund as an \noperational subsidy is required. It is assumed that optimum biennial tariffs are insufficient to \nensure required operating ratios. With tariffs set at optimum biennial increases (Table A9.5), the \ntotal annual accumulative tariff subsidies or viability gap funding would amount to $24.12 million \nfor both JSCs for ensuring full cost recovery, as given in Table A9.6. \n \nTable A9.6: Subproject Subsidy Needs \n($ million) \nSubproject   Subproject \n Level   Cost Recovery  Total  Goychay  Nakchivan \nI  O&M Cost     4.132   2  .913    1 .219\nII  O&M Cost + Depreciation    21.033   1 3.913    7 .120\nIII  O&M Cost + Depreciation + Debt    24.119   1 5.684    8 .434\nO&M = operation and maintenance. \nAsian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n23.  Financial  Viability  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  Sensitivity  tests  were  performed  to \ndetermine the effects of (i) a 20% increase in investment cost, (ii) a 20% increase in operation \nand maintenance costs, (iii) a 20% decrease in revenue, and (iv) a 1-year delay in project \nrevenue generation on subproject viability. Table A9.7 shows both subprojects remaining robust \nin all sensitivity parameters. For the two subprojects, the highest risk will be a 20% decrease in \nrevenue generation. A change in capital investment cost by 36.5% in Goychay and 64% in \nNakhchivan will still result in an acceptable FIRR and positive financial net present value for the \nsubprojects. The two subprojects are found to be financially viable, but will require operational \nsubsidies to attain full cost recovery (i.e., operation and maintenance, depreciation and debt \ncoverage). At tariffs set to FIRR greater than WACC, FIRR for subproject Goychay is 4.5%, and \nfor subproject Nakhchivan, 5.5%, an average of 5.0% for the two subprojects.  \n ", "  Appendix 9  61 \nTable A9.7: Subproject FIRR \n(%) \nParticulars  Subproject   Subproject \nAverage \nGoychay  Nakchivan \nBase Case  5.0 4.5 5.5\nCapital Cost plus 20% 3.7 3.2 4.2\nO&M Cost plus 20% 4.5 4.2 4.8\nRevenue less 20% 2.9 2.6 3.2\n1-year Delay in Benefit 4.0 3.6 4.5\nSwitching Value - Capital Cost  40.0 32.3 47.8\nSwitching Value - Revenue  23.8 21.6 26.1\nAt WACC, Capital Cost variablea 50.3 36.5 64.0\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital \naCapital cost may increase by this variable and still remain within WACC.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  Conclusion. Analysis findings indicate that the subproject JSCs are financially viable on \ntwo conditions: (i) required periodic tariff increases (herein assumed every 2 years), and (ii) \nviability  gap  funding  for  full  cost  recovery  within  consumer  affordability  levels.  For  these \nconditions  to  be  relevant  to  the  succeeding  subprojects,  they  must  be  incorporated  when \npreparing the financial reform operational plans. These reform plans and related issues have \nbeen discussed with and agreed to by AZERSU, State Amelioration and Water Management \nAgency (SAWMA), and other pertinent government agencies with the aim of achieving financial \nsustainability  of  the  overall  investment.  Issues  pertaining  to  subsidization,  manner  of \nimplementation, and funds sourcing are specifically relevant. Income affordability is a major \nfactor  in  determining  subsidy  requirement,  and  thus  the  household  income  base  must  be \nreviewed periodically. \n ", "62   Appendix 10 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: Azerbaijan/Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department \nMultitranche Financing Facility \nModality:   Division  Urban Services Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nAn 8-year, $600 million program under a multitranche financing facility, the Investment Program will fund basic urban \ninfrastructure  improvements  in  secondary  towns  within  Azerbaijan  and  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous  Republic.  The \ninvestments in water supply and wastewater infrastructure, along  with institutional reforms and capacity development \ninitiatives to improve service delivery, are consistent with the key strategic goals of Azerbaijan\u2019s state program on poverty \nreduction and sustainable development.a The Investment Program will uphold the state program\u2019s goals by improving public \ninfrastructure, developing sustainable environmental management, and improving public administration and good governance. \nThe Investment Program also aims to reduce the 13% poverty level in the towns in conjunction with the state program target \ngoals of an overall poverty level of 8% and extreme poverty elimination by 2015. Also, in accordance with the state program, \nthe Investment Program will promote the participation and employment of women in decision-making roles ranging from local \nto executive levels and will reduce the gap in indicators for female and male employment. \n \nThe Investment Program will focus on providing approximately 500,000 persons with access to improved water and sanitation \nservices. With direct access to basic services, the poor in the region will be able to productively use the available time in \ngainful  employment,  thereby  alleviating  poverty  levels.  Improvements  in  the  quality  of  water  and  disposal  of  treated \nwastewater will lead to public health improvements and reductions in the burden of waterborne diseases, treatment costs, and \nproductive losses, the impact of which is predominantly felt by the poor. Women, especially poor women, will benefit from the \nreduction in the time and energy spent in fetching and storing water, and in the work associated with cleaning and family \nhealth care. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nPoverty remains relatively high in Azerbaijan. According to a 2008 speech given by the chairperson of statistics, on the basis \nof consumption per capita, an estimated 13.2% of the population lives below the poverty line and 2.0% live in extreme \npoverty. However, in 2003, the poverty level was 45.0% while the extreme poverty level was 9.6%. The national poverty line is \nestimated as the cost of a minimum consumption basket, calculated on the basis of per capita monthly minimum consumption \nnorms. The unit of observation for poverty statistics is the individual. Analysis of house budget survey data for 2002\u20132005 \nshows that there is a small difference in the poverty rates for urban and rural areas. The exception is between Baku and the \nrest of the country; the poverty incidence Baku has been declining at a faster rate than for the rest of the population. There \nare also regional differences in poverty levels, with the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and Upper Shirvan having the \nhighest levels. Furthermore, internally displaced persons (refugees) have higher poverty levels than the rest of the population. \nIn 2007, the average poverty incidence among these persons was 37% (compared to 16% for the country). The highest \npoverty incidence among internally displaced persons in 2003 was observed in rural settlements (61%), while in urban areas, \nthe poverty level for internally displaced persons was approximately 42%. In contrast, there are no significant differences in \nthe poverty levels for men and women. \nTo deal with poverty issues, approximately 30 types of social benefits for 13 categories of vulnerable groups are included in \nAzerbaijan\u2019s poverty alleviation programs. These programs were created under the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on \nSocial Benefits (2006). \nThere is a significant level of uneven economic development in Azerbaijan. The wealthiest 10% of the population control \n29.5% of the wealth, while the poorest 10% control only 3.1%. The wealth was originally attributed to the booming oil industry. \nHowever, the recorded share of the non-oil sector in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 was approximately 50%. The \nGDP has remained relatively high in spite of the global economic crisis. The GDP real growth rate for Azerbaijan was 15.6% \nin 2008, and its economic growth is reflected in its low unemployment rate of 6.5% (2007). The GDP rates were 26%, 35%, \nand 24%, respectively, in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Poverty has responded strongly to economic growth\u2014in the past 4 years, \noverall poverty has fallen by 16%, a 4% decrease. \na Republic of Azerbaijan. 2008. State Program on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development for 2006\u20132015. Baku. \n ", "  Appendix 10  63 \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe average monthly household income for 2007 in rural and urban areas was AZN110 ($136). As of 2008, the minimum \nsalary wage per month was AZN60 ($74). The 2007 unemployment rate for Azerbaijan was 6.5%, with more women \nregistered as unemployed. In program towns, the majority of men work in agriculture, while the women work in lower-paid \npublic sectors including teaching, medicine, and nursing. There is a relatively decent representation of health care and school \nfacilities within the project towns. \nIn Azerbaijan, approximately 60% of the Baku\u2013Absheron region and 46.5% of the towns and villages have access to an \nuninterrupted, good-quality water supply. In program towns, approximately 35% of the towns have access to a piped water \nsupply system. Of the percentage of people that have water supply, none receive a continuous 24-hour supply, some lacking \nwater for several days. On average, 35% of people obtain water from water trucks, and 18% must walk to water sources with \ndistances ranging from 150 meters to a maximum of 3 kilometers. Water sources other than water trucks include standpipes \nand private wells. About 75% of the population is dissatisfied with the water quality and pressure. Between 3% and 23% have \nfallen ill with short-term stomach sicknesses due to poor-quality water within program towns. \nWithin the towns surveyed, 15% of the population has sewage collection. Most households use pit latrines and some use \nseptic tanks, which often overflow. Also, households discharge sewage directly to the roadside channels that line the streets \nand flow through the towns. During periods of rain, sewage overflows into the streets and on public property. Also, there are \nmany blockages and overflows that often affect residential areas. Approximately 85% of respondents surveyed have sewage \nproblems on their property. There is currently no wastewater treatment in most towns. Although in many towns, there were \nplans to build conventional wastewater treatment plants during Soviet times, the plants were never constructed.  \nWater was perceived as the highest priority for all the towns surveyed; sanitation in all towns was also recognized as a \npriority. The general awareness of sanitary standards is lacking in the towns. Many surveyed did not realize that the open \nsewage channels were linked with malaria and other waterborne diseases. \nAbout 45%\u201380% of locals were willing to pay for a 24-hour, good quality water supply and sanitation collection services. Most \nwould be willing to pay AZN2.0\u2013AZN5.5 ($2.50\u2013$6.80) per month for water supply or according to what the water meter \nreads. Similarly, most would be willing to pay AZN5.0 ($6.20) per month for wastewater collection. They were, therefore, \nwilling to pay a maximum of approximately 10% of their salaries for basic water and wastewater services. \nThe potential primary beneficiaries of the Investment Program are the urban populations of towns. The urban populations \ninclude refugees and displaced persons. Between 100 and 6,000 refugees and 20 to 1,600 internally displaced persons have \nresidence in the project towns. Under the Investment Program, basic services will be provided to all refugees and internally \ndisplaced persons. The Investment Program will also provide an opportunity to strengthen the role of women in the \ncommunity, thereby raising their status. It is expected that women will become empowered by being involved in the local town \nwater users\u2019 associations and in decision-making positions within the implementing and executing agencies. The Investment \nProgram will also lessen the burden on women as the main collectors of water and as nurses for the sick affected by \nunsanitary conditions. The subprojects will provide employment opportunities for residents, both in the construction or repair \nof water supply and sanitation systems, as well as in the management of the systems. Overall, time will be saved, and better \nhealth will improve the productive capacity of the whole population. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.   Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nExtensive consultations have been undertaken with stakeholders, including project towns, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and community-based organizations, elected representatives, administrative departments, rayon (town) \nadministrations, and representatives of various government ministries. Meetings, focus group discussions with NGOs, and \nstructured interviews were undertaken with stakeholders.  \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nExtensive consultations have been undertaken with stakeholders including affected persons (emphasizing women and the \ndisadvantaged), beneficiary communities, NGOs and community-based organizations, elected representatives, administrative \ndepartments,  rayon  administrations,  and  representatives  of  various  government  ministries.  Meetings,  focus  group \n ", "64   Appendix 10 \ndiscussions,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  structured  interviews  were  undertaken  with  stakeholders  to  enable \ntransparency of project works and operations. To date, consultations were held with six sample project towns. The meetings \ninvolved municipal officials, elected representatives, NGOs, and a sample of randomly selected citizens (of which at least \n50% were female). In these meetings, mayors and project engineers familiarized the towns with the designs. The towns\u2019 \nenvironmental concerns and ideas on improving the water and sanitation systems have been analyzed and incorporated \nwhere appropriate into the project designs and mitigation measures. All towns showed interest in participating in the town \nwater users\u2019 associations to liaise with the program management facility and administrative officials to address any water- or \nwastewater-related concerns or issues. All public consultation notes are attached to the initial environmental examinations \nincluded as supplementary appendixes. \nThe consultation and participation plan comprises three distinct components: (i) the community awareness and participation \nprogram, (ii) hygiene and sanitation education program, and (iii) training program. A major feature of the proposed institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component includes enabling SuKanals (town water supply and sanitation agencies) and \njoint stock companies to take a more participatory approach to water supply and sanitation development and service delivery. \nImplementation support has been developed, including the provision of a social development specialist within the executing \nagencies and provisions supporting the creation of town water users\u2019 associations.  \nOngoing consultations and participatory monitoring will take the form of community forums or focus group discussions \ncombined with annual surveys including disaggregated gender, internally displaced persons, refugee, and poverty surveys to \nnotice effects on women and the disadvantaged. The media for this public information mechanism will include local television, \nnewsletters, and community meetings. \nC.  Gender and Development \nKey Issues  \nWomen are most frequently the household members who are most affected by the lack of adequate, clean, and safe water. \nAdult women are the main collectors of water when there is no individual house connection (in approximately 65% of the \nhouseholds for the project towns). As such, there is a clear need to ensure women are involved in the design, monitoring, \nevaluation, and management of the water supply and sewage collection systems. However, in most towns, women are \nseverely underrepresented on the town councils. Currently, the share of women working on the municipal decision-making \nlevel is only 4.08%. Public consultation meetings indicated that women expressed a clear desire to play a more central role in \nthe planning and management of the water and wastewater system planning and implementation.  \n \nUnder the gender action plan, women will constitute at least one third of the town water users\u2019 association representative \nbodies. Also, at least one third of the joint stock companies\u2019 board of directors will be qualified women. The Investment \nProgram includes available funds for the employment and training of women as well as a budget to promote public awareness \nof gender issues by the executing and implementing agencies. Investment Program costs also include hiring a social \nspecialist and NGOs focused on women\u2019s issues (65 such NGOs currently exist in Azerbaijan) that will update the gender \naction plan and prepare annual progress reports on gender impacts. Furthermore, the 5% unemployment gap within \nAzerbaijan  in  the  indicators  for  women  and  men\u2019s  employment  will  be  reduced  by  employing  and  encouraging  the \nparticipation of women in positions on local and executive levels.  \n \nFurther planning for analyses on gender-sensitivity and gender mainstreaming in the program cycle will be determined based \non progress. It is planned to use monitoring and evaluation systems, which will generate gender-disaggregated information to \nenable the tracking of gender implications brought about by the Investment Program. \nKey Actions \nMeasures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use of \nrelevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n   Gender plan     Other actions/measures     No action/measure \nThe Investment Program responds to the key issues above in the design of its subprojects.  \n ", "  Appendix 10  65 \n \nIII.

Background \n1.  The  Government  of  Azerbaijan  has  requested  a  $600  million  loan  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to undertake a water supply and sanitation investment program for \nperi-urban  areas  around  Baku  and  other  secondary  towns.  With  AZERSU  and  the  State \nAmelioration  and  Water  Management  Agency  (SAWMA)  as  executing  agencies  (EAs),  the \nAzerbaijan Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program (the Investment Program) will be \nfinanced through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) involving five tranches. The tranche 1 \nproject for which details have been finalized aims to improve water supply and sanitation \nfacilities in the towns of Goychay and Nakhchivan. No land acquisition and resettlement is \nrequired  for  the  tranche  1  project.  If  any,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  for \nsubsequent tranches are expected to be minimal. To address this possibility, the EAs have \ndeveloped a land acquisition and resettlement framework, which is summarized below.  \nB.  General Procedures \n2.  Land acquisition and resettlement will follow the existing laws of the Government, ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  section  on  involuntary \nresettlement.1 The MFF, each tranche appraisal, and the approval and implementation of each \ntranche project with land acquisition and resettlement issues will require the preparation of   \n(i)  a land acquisition and resettlement framework to be reviewed\u2014and if necessary \nupdated\u2014and then submitted for ADB approval at the start of the preparation of \neach tranche after the first; \n(ii)  an initial poverty and social assessment indicating, for each tranche, whether \nland acquisition and resettlement will occur, and if so, expected impacts, type, \nand magnitude; \n(iii)  a land acquisition and resettlement plan to be updated, if necessary, based on \ndetailed  design  for  each  subproject  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts.2 \n \n3.  The MFF and each tranche appraisal comprising project approval and implementation \nwill follow these land acquisition and resettlement-related conditions.  \n(i)  Multitranche financing facility and first tranche appraisal. Conditional to the \npreparation of (a) a land acquisition and resettlement framework for the MFF \napproved  by  ADB  and  EAs;  and  (b)  implementable  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans approved by ADB and EAs for all tranche 1 subprojects with \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts (if any). \n(ii)  Periodic financing request approval for successive tranches. Conditional to \n(a)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  review  and  update;  and  (b) \npreparation of an implementable land acquisition and resettlement plan approved \nby  ADB  and  EAs  and  consistent  with  the  revised  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  framework  for  each  subproject  with  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement impacts. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. OM F2: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  As noted in the ADB Operations Manual section on involuntary resettlement, the details and complexity of land \nacquisition and resettlement plans depend on impact severity. If impacts are severe (more than 200 affected \npersons resettled or with more than 10% income losses), a subproject is classified as category A and a full plan is \nto be prepared. If impacts are non-severe (less than 200 affected persons resettled or with less than 10% income \nlosses), a subproject is classified as category B and only a short plan is to be prepared. \n ", "70   Appendix 12  \n(iii)  Civil  works  contract  awards  signing.  Conditional to the preparation of an \nimplementable land acquisition and resettlement plans approved by ADB and \nEAs and consistent with the land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n(iv)  Provision of notice to proceed to contractors. Conditional to full land acquisition \nand  resettlement  plan  implementation  (full  delivery  of  compensation  and/or \nrehabilitation provisions) for the relevant project. This condition will be clearly spelled \nout in the civil works contract. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n4.  Investment Program land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out based on (i) \navoiding  or  at  least  minimizing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  (ii)  compensation \nguaranteeing  the  maintenance  of  affected  persons\u2019  pre-project  living  standards;  (iii)  fully \ninforming affected persons of compensation options; (iv) supporting and using affected persons' \nsociocultural institutions; (v) applying land acquisition and resettlement provisions equally to \nwomen and men; (vi) not barring compensation and/or rehabilitation due to lack of a formal title; \n(vii) paying particular attention to households headed by women and vulnerable groups; (viii) \nexecuting land acquisition and resettlement as integral part of a project, and including land \nacquisition and resettlement budgets in project costs; and (ix) providing full compensation prior \nto taking over acquired property.  \n \n5.  Eligibility. Affected persons eligible for compensation or at least rehabilitation provisions \nare \n(i)  all affected persons losing land either with legal title or traditional land rights or \nno legal status; \n(ii)  tenants and sharecroppers whether registered or not; \n(iii)  owners of buildings, crops, plants, or other objects attached to the land whether \nregistered or not; and \n(iv)  affected persons losing business, income, and salaries. \n \n6.  Eligibility will be limited by a cut-off date to be set for each project on the final day of the \nimpacts or affected persons survey. Affected persons settling in affected areas after the cut-off \ndate  will  not  be  eligible.  They,  however,  will  be given  sufficient advance  notice  to  vacate \npremises or dismantle affected structures prior to project implementation. Their dismantled \nstructures will not be confiscated, and they will not be fined or sanctioned. \n \n7.  Entitlements.  Entitlements  for  affected  persons  losing  land,  houses,  or  income; \nrehabilitation subsidies for land, house and building, crops and trees, and business and income \nlosses; and cash allowances for relocation will be provided to severely affected persons and \nvulnerable affected persons.

Institutional Responsibilities. AZERSU has overall responsibility for all aspects of the \nInvestment  Program,  although  SAWMA  will  be  responsible  for  the  Investment  Program  in \nNakhchivan. The AZERSU program management facility3 is tasked with day-to-day program \nmanagement,  including  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  interagency  coordination.  The \nsafeguards unit at the program management facility is directly responsible for land acquisition \nand resettlement-related planning, implementation, interagency coordination, and monitoring. \nHowever, it will carry out this responsibility with assistance from consultants and the active \nparticipation  of  the  rayon  (town)  executive  powers  and  the  State  Land  and  Cartography \nCommittee.  \n \n9.  To  provide  effective  interagency  coordination  and  officially  endorse  surveys  and \ncompensation rates, each affected rayon will establish a land acquisition and resettlement \ncommission  with  members  from  rayon  administration,  State  Committee  of  Land  and \nCartography, and State Real Estate Registration Service. This commission will have jurisdiction \nover land administration, valuation, and acquisition. At the national level, the Government will \nestablish a similar central commission, chaired by the State Committee of Land and Cartography. \nThis commission will carry out final land acquisition and resettlement plan reviews and approve their \nfinancing and implementation. \n  \n10.

As an appraisal condition, \nland acquisition and resettlement plans and framework will be disclosed on the ADB website in \nEnglish, while they will be disclosed directly to affected communities in the local language. \n \n11.  Grievances will be handled first at local level; then, in the absence of a solution, formally \nthrough rayon land acquisition and resettlement commissions; and finally through the central \nland acquisition and resettlement commission.

Introduction \n1.  The purposes of the Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Program (the Investment \nProgram) are to provide access to safe, reliable, and sustainable water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) services for towns throughout Azerbaijan and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic and \nto promote a healthier environment by developing proper wastewater collection and treatment \nsystems.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  adopted  for  the \nInvestment Program for the environmental assessment and review of future projects. These \nprocedures have been developed during the preparation of initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs)  for  core  subprojects  in  Agdash,  Agdjabedi,  Balaken,  Beylagan,  Goychay,  and \nNakhchivan towns. The environmental assessment and review framework must be conducted \nfor projects to comply with the Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Law on State \nEcological Expertise under the competence of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources \nand Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB).  \n \nB.  Investment Program Review \n2.  After  thorough  analysis  of  six  sample  subcomponents  of  projects,  the  Investment \nProgram is classified under ADB guidelines as category B. A screening and categorization \nprocedure will be completed for each new project to ensure that the potential environmental \nimpacts will not change the existing categorization. Investment Program components comprise \nthree parts: (i) construction of source water intake, disinfection, and retention infrastructure; (ii) \nrehabilitation and extension of water distribution and sewage systems; and (iii) construction of \nwastewater treatment infrastructure.  \n \nC.  Impacts and Measures \n3.  The  screening  process  carried  out  for  the  IEEs  identified  minor  possible  adverse \nenvironmental impacts likely to be caused by the Investment Program. Most potential negative \nimpacts may occur during construction, including noise, dust, traffic congestion, and runoff. \nHowever, these impacts will be temporary and can be mitigated to acceptable levels. Other \nimpacts from source abstraction and discharge into receiving water bodies will be mitigated by \nproper design. All potential environmental threats and respective mitigation measures are listed \nin the summary IEE (Appendix 14) and all subcomponent IEEs (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nD.  Azerbaijan\u2019s Environmental Assessment Laws and Institutions \n4.  Institutions. There are four principal environmental institutions in Azerbaijan and the \nNakhchivan Autonomous Republic that handle water resources protection, management, and \noperation. These include (i) Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources; (ii) Ministry of Health; \n(iii) Ministry of Emergency Situations, which implements construction safety supervision and \nstandards and regulates safe sewerage discharges and WSS operations; and (iv) AZERSU and \nState Amelioration and Water Management Agency (SAWMA), which will manage WSS in the \nInvestment Program.  \n \n5.  Laws.  The  most  pertinent  laws  within  Azerbaijan  and  the  Nakhchivan  Autonomous \nRepublic affecting water and wastewater infrastructure\u2014which have been incorporated into the \nenvironmental management plan\u2014include: Environmental Protection (1999); State Ecological \nExpertise (1996); Water Code (1998); Water Supply and Wastewater (2000); Sanitary\u2013Hygienic \n ", "  Appendix 13  75 \nState  (1992);  various  water  quality,  air,  and  noise  standards;  GOST  (various  years);  the \nEuropean Economic Community directive for wastewater standards; construction norms and \nregulations; and SNiP. \n \nE.  Environmental Categorization and Criteria for Subproject Selection \n6.  All  sample  subcomponents  reviewed  are  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB's \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines. Category B specifies that an IEE is required for the \nproject  or  subcomponents  to  determine  whether  environmental  impacts  warrant  an \nenvironmental impact assessment. If an assessment is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal  environmental  assessment  report.  Within  Azerbaijan  and  Nakhchivan  Autonomous \nRepublic, environmental assessment and review frameworks must be in accordance with state \necological expertise. If an activity is assessed to result in more than minor potential impacts, a \nfull  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  Since  categorization  is  absent  under \nAzerbaijan and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic environmental regulations, ADB guidelines \nwill be adopted for project categorization under the Investment Program. \n \n7.  No  category  A  projects  will  be  approved  under  the  Investment  Program.  The \nenvironmental criteria used for the first level of screening will exclude all subcomponents that \nhave (i) any subcomponent located in strict nature reserves, (ii) any significant loss of primary \nforest  or  other  sensitive  wetland,  (iii)  any  permanent  negative  effect  on  a  known  rare  or \nendangered species, (iv) any significant impacts on air or water quality, (v) any significant \nadverse  impacts  to  downstream  ecosystems  and  water  users,  (vi)  any  proposed  water \nabstraction  rates  beyond  Azerbaijan\u2019s  prescribed  value,  or  (vii) any  permanent  damage  to \ncultural relics. \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures \n8.  State ecological expertise within the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources mandate \nan  environmental  impact  assessment.  The  basic  procedures  for  the  assessment  are \ndocumented in a 1996 handbook, which indicates that if a full assessment is required, the \nimplementing agency must submit associated documentation to state ecological expertise for a \n3-month review period. If the application is accepted, the implementing agency must provide a \nprogress report to state ecological expertise within 12 months of the decision. After approval is \ngiven, the construction works must begin within 1 year. \n \n9.  Under the ADB Environmental Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines, \ndeveloping an environmental impact assessment for category B projects involves submitting an \nIEE  and  developing  an  environmental  management  plan.  An  IEE  conducted  under  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  must  be  submitted  by  the  program  management  facility  to  state  ecological \nexpertise. \n \nG.  Implementation Framework for the Environmental Assessment and Review \nFramework  \n10.  A summary of the environmental assessment and review procedures and respective \nresponsibilities are summarized in Table A13.1. \n \n ", "76  Appendix 13 \n \nFigure A13: Parties Involved with Program Environmental Assessment and Review \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank; AzerSu = AzerSu Joint Stock Company; JSCs = joint stock companies; MENR = \nMinistry of Ecology and Natural Resources; NAR = Nakchivan Autonomous Republic; PMF = program management \nfacility; PMO = program management office; SAWMA = State Amelioration and Water Management Agency  \nSource: Asian Development Bank; AZERSU Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management \nAgency. \n \nTable A13.1: Institutional Responsibilities \n \nInstitution  Basic Role  Detailed Responsibilities \nPMO or PMF  Develop the  Preparing environmental monitoring and management plans (EMMPs) for SEE review \nenvironmental  project, \nPeriodic submission of environmental monitoring report to ADB for public disclosure \nsafeguards  perform all \ngroup with  environmental  Performing monitoring with site inspectors and civil work surveys \nassistance  testing and \nfrom national  prepare all  Collecting and analyzing information on water quality, sewage treatment levels, and \nsocial and  documents  construction impact within the towns in accordance with MOH and MES regulations \nenvironmental \nEstablishing environmental classifications under ADB regulations and determining \nspecialists \nneed for subproject IEEs \nScreening and preparation of subproject IEEs including cost estimates for mitigation \nmeasures and monitoring plans for SEE.

Environmental Management Plan \n11.  An environmental management plan will be prepared by the safeguards unit within the \nprogram management facility as part of the IEE. The plan defines the mitigation measures, \nresponsible party, cost of mitigation, parameters to monitor, frequency of monitoring, time and \nlocation of monitoring, responsibility, and cost of monitoring. It must be adapted to the specific \nrequirements  of  the  project  in  question.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  subproject \ndocumentation ex poste and to gain access to the subproject sites if deemed necessary.  \n12.  The  consultants  will  prepare  a  contract-level  and  site-specific  environmental \nmanagement  plan  to  facilitate  tracking  of  their  performance  in  the  implementation  of  the \nmitigation measures. Also, the terms of reference for the consultants must specify supervision \nand monitoring of its performance. The consultants' duties include updating and completing \nprogram details, responsibilities, and contingency to show progress on mitigation actions.  \n13.  Water  quality  monitoring  requirements  for  the  plan  are  in  accordance  with  GOST \n17.1.3.07-82 standards. Control on water quality will be conducted 1 kilometer (km) upstream \nand 0.5\u20131.5 km downstream from the point of intake. Each borehole or infiltration gallery will be \nsampled  during  development  and  operation,  and  the  raw  water  quality  and  outlet  of  the \n ", "78  Appendix 13 \ntreatment plant and reservoir must be monitored daily. During operation, intermediate points as \nwell as the extremities of the network will be sampled daily. Test for both free and residual \nchlorine and chemical and microbiological tests will be conducted. Control on water quality will \ncommence  at  least  3  months  before  construction  to  establish  a  baseline.  The  program \nmanagement  facility\u2019s  safeguard  specialists  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  periodic \nmonitoring.  \n14.  As  there  are  no  specific  wastewater  discharge  sampling  requirements  and  limits \nspecified under Azerbaijan or Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic\u2019s regulations, a European \nEconomic Community directive (No. 91/271/EEC), has been adopted by the Ministry of Health in \nAzerbaijan and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic within the environmental management plan. \nAccording to this directive, daily samples will be taken at a well-defined point in the inlet and \noutlet of the wastewater treatment plant. Under the Investment Program, a third sample is \nrequired to be taken at a distance downstream to determine the effect on the receiving water \nbody. If the receiving water body is prone to eutrophication, special attention will be given to \ntotal phosphorous and total nitrogen levels. Depending on the annual number of samples, a \nmaximum number of exceedances are permitted (excluding extreme events such as heavy \nrainfall). Stricter regulations are required for effluent being discharged into canals used for \nfishing purposes. Sludge will be reused whenever appropriate, dewatered, and dried before \ndisposal to a Ministry of Health-approved landfill site. The specific sampling points will be \ndetermined  during  detailed  design.  The  wastewater  treatment  plant  operators  will  be \nresponsible for daily testing. \nI.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n15.  According to Azerbaijan regulation, public consultation for any project has to be carried \nout twice\u2014first at the detailed design stage (to address all important comments) and then at the \nend of the project. All stakeholders, as well as any affected persons, must be present at the \nsecond public consultation. All environmental project documents must also be stored in Baku's \nAarhus Centre and filed at the project towns\u2019 public libraries.  \n16.  ADB also requires public consultation and information disclosure in the environmental \nassessment  process  for  category  B  projects  in  accordance  with  para.  7  of  its  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). The information disclosure and consultation must be carried out \nwith  local  nongovernment  organizations  as  early  as  possible  in  the  project  cycle.  Public \nconsultation feedback must be disclosed to the public and attached as an appendix to the IEEs. \nAny grievance redress issues will be resolved according to the Program\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement framework. \nJ.  Future Subprojects  \n17.  The  frameworks  documented  herein  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies as outlined in ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). A budget \nhas also been outlined in Table A13.2 to provide general costs for future project towns to gain \nthe capacity to follow these procedures. By adhering to this document and using the six sample \nsubcomponents as examples, future projects will be able to uphold the environmental and social \nstandards mandated by the Investment Program. \n ", "  Appendix 13  79 \nTable A13.2: Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Costs to Investment Program \n \nEnvironmental Mitigation Item  Investment Program Costs  \nHiring national social and environmental specialists  $147,250 (two consultants for 30 person-months and one \nhydrogeologist for 2 person-monthsa, at 30 person-months) \nPreparing environmental assessment reports  $10,000 \nWater and wastewater monitoring cost  $20,000 \nCalculating source abstraction limits  Covered by program consultants \nProtecting source from contamination  Covered by program consultants \nInvoluntary resettlement issues  Covered by safeguards specialist  \nPerforming environmental monitoring  Covered by AZERSU or SAWMA experience and by hiring \nenvironmental specialist \nGood design of water and wastewater pipelines  Covered by program consultants \nPrevention of unsafe water delivery  Covered by program consultants \nDamage to soil, ecology, heritage, crops   Covered by environmental and social specialists \nPreventing construction pollution and wastes   \nProtecting against soil and water contamination  Covered by tender and contract documents  \nDust, air quality, noise  Covered by tender and contract documents  \nProper waste disposal   Covered by tender and contract documents  \nTraining   \nWorker health and safety  Covered by tender and contract documents  \nWWTP operation  Training provided by contractor and vendor \nChlorine handling and health and safety  Training provided by contractor and vendor \nRepair of water, sewage, and metering systems  $100,000 \nO&M for water and sewer distribution networks;  $100,000 \nmaintaining pressures and detecting leaks \nTotal  $377,250 \nAzerSu = AzerSu Joint Stock Company; SAWMA = State Amelioration and Water Management Agency; WWTP = \nwastewater treatment plant \na For the Agdash and Goychay well developments, an additional $4,750 is required to hire a hydrogeologist for   \n2 months. \nSource: Asian Development Bank; AZERSU Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water Management Agency.\n ", " 80  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  analyzes  the  potential \nenvironmental impacts and mitigation measures associated with the Azerbaijan Water Supply \nand  Sanitation  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)\u2014specifically,  based  on  IEE \nreports for two subprojects under the tranche 1 project, water and wastewater infrastructure \nimprovements.  The  Investment  Program  is  classified  under  Asian  Development  (ADB) \nguidelines as category B. According to ADB policy for category B projects, an IEE is required as \nthe first stage in developing an environmental impact assessment. The Republic of Azerbaijan \nLaw on State Ecological Expertise (also adopted by the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic) also \nrequires infrastructure upgrading projects to be subjected to environmental assessment. \n \n2.  IEEs have been prepared for two subproject towns (Goychay and Nakhchivan) under the \ntranche  1  project.  No  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  were  noted  in  these \nsubprojects, and identified minor environmental impacts can be readily mitigated using sensible \ndesign  and  construction  contract  and  management  measures.  Implementation  of  these \nsubprojects will be subject to IEE approval by Azerbaijan\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Natural \nResources (MENR) and the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic\u2019s MENR. \nB.  Description of the Investment Program \n3.  Water supply to consumers in the program towns is intermittent and of limited quantity. \nWater quality is poor and contains high levels of silt. Many consumers purchase water from \nprivate vendors to augment their supply. Similarly, sewage systems are failing, and pipes are \nclogged and broken. During heavy rains, raw sewage floods the streets and house compounds, \nand existing treatment facilities fail to operate. Approximately 35% and 15% of the existing \npopulation is connected to the water supply and sewage collection systems, respectively. \n \n4.  Investment Program components comprise three parts: (i) construction of source water \nintakes, disinfection, and retention infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitation and/or construction of water \nsupply  and  sanitary  collection  systems;  and  (iii)  construction  of  wastewater  treatment \ninfrastructure. Proposed subproject components under the tranche 1 project are listed in Table \nA14.1. \n \nTable A14.1: Proposed Construction Works for Sample Subprojects \n \nItem  Proposed Construction Works  Goychay  Nakhchivan \n1  New reservoir(s)  1 X 500 m3  1 X 10,000 m3\n1 X 1000 m3 \n2  New water trunk main to town network  - 7.5 km\n3  New water supply network  108 km 22 km\n4  New wastewater collection network  98.5 km 33 km\nkm = kilometer; m3 = cubic meter. \nSource: Asian Development Bank; AZERSU Joint Stock Company; State Amelioration and Water \nManagement Agency estimates. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n5.  Goychay  is  located  at  an  average  altitude  of  150  meters.  The  average  annual \ntemperature  is  14  degrees  Celsius  (\u00b0C),  and  the  annual  average  precipitation  level  is \n ", "                                                                                                                           Appendix 14   81\napproximately 400 millimeters. The town of Nakhchivan is located at an altitude of 1,000 meters. \nThe average summer and winter temperatures are 28\u00b0C and \u20135\u00b0C, respectively. The average \nannual precipitation is 270 millimeters. \n \n6.  The water supply for Goychay currently comes from river infiltration galleries, which were \nconstructed about 45 years ago. The town also uses supplementary boreholes; however, these \nwells have insufficient capacity. Due to floods, the infiltration galleries have been destroyed, and \nthe water quality is poor. These galleries are also located in the environmentally sensitive and \nprotected area of Turyanchay State Nature Reserve. There is, however, a sufficient supply from \nexisting well sites used by Goychay if new wells are constructed at deeper depths.  \n \n7.  Nakhchivan extracts infiltration gallery water from the Nakhchivan River floodplain area \nto feed the town. The river source has sufficient supply, is relatively pristine, and will continue to \nbe used after improved galleries are built to withstand flood conditions and to filter turbid water \nat  flood  times.  Also,  the  Heydar  Aliyev  Water  Reservoir  has  recently  been  constructed \nupstream, which will enable flood control, sedimentation of turbid water, and a more constant \nflow rate. In Nakhchivan, local households have also built keherises (shallow wells), which \ncannot continue to be used, because many have collapsed or have been contaminated by \nsewage. Similarly, several boreholes within the town can no longer be used, because their \ncapacity is not sufficient to supply the entire town. \n \n8.  The  towns\u2019  most  prevalent  water  quality  problems  are  the  deterioration  of  existing \nsewage collection and treatment systems, and high silt content in the source water due to the \ndeterioration of existing infiltration galleries. Currently, sewage is collected in open channels, \nposing serious health risks. With the Investment Program, designs include effective treatment \nmeasures;  however,  the  Nakhchivan  source  should  be  filtered  and  softened  as  well  as \nchlorinated. All towns will have new reservoirs constructed and some rehabilitated. Improved \nchlorination facilities will be built at all reservoir sites. New wastewater treatment facilities will be \nconstructed in all towns, as existing treatment plants were either never fully constructed or not \nmaintained. New water supply and sewage collection lines also need to be constructed due to \nsignificant  leaks.  Existing  asbestos  concrete  pipes  will  be  left  undisturbed  due  to  the \nenvironmental risks of repair.1  \n \n9.  The Investment Program includes about 13% of the population living in poverty within \neach town. The base of the district economy in Goychay is agriculture with cropping of grains, \ncotton, and fruit, as well as animal breeding. Nakhchivan\u2019s economy is based upon small \nindustry, clothing, and tourism, as well as agriculture. The towns have sufficient educational and \nmedical facilities. Overall, populations are increasing in Goychay at an average rate of 1.0% and \nin Nakhchivan at an average rate of 0.5%. \n \n10.  IEE fieldwork and interviews did not reveal concerns with vegetation at the subproject \nsites, as it is of low value and can be regrown or replanted easily. Although cultural sites such \nas cemeteries exist, no cultural, archeological, or heritage sites are expected to be affected by \nthe subprojects, as they have been avoided in the designs. If important archeological resources \nare found, the water or wastewater component will be rerouted or moved to an appropriate \ndistance away from the site, meeting Ministry of Culture requirements. Furthermore, although all \n                                                 \n1  Asbestos piping is dangerous to handle due to the risks of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers, which may lead to \ndiseases such as asbestosis and lung cancer. Working with asbestos piping requires specific protection measures \nin accordance with the National Asbestos Management Plan, 2006, Australia. \n ", " 82  Appendix 14 \nsubproject sites are within 2\u201316 kilometers of a nature reserve, no program components will be \nconstructed within the reserves or will impose adverse impacts. \nD.  Screening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n11.  Identified  negative  impacts  during  construction  are  moderate  in  extent  and  can  be \nmitigated. All potential environmental threats and respective mitigation measures are listed in \nTable A14.2. \nE.  Institutional Arrangements and Monitoring Program \n12.  The Investment Program will be executed by AZERSU in Goychay and by the State \nAmelioration and Water Management Agency (SAWMA) in Nakhchivan through the program \nmanagement facility. The joint stock companies will develop the project works in the towns \nunder the guidance of the program management facility. A summary of the responsible parties \nand their respective environmental assessment and review tasks is included in the summary \nenvironmental assessment and review framework in Appendix 13. \n13.  The environmental management plan for the towns defines the mitigation measures, \nresponsible party, cost of mitigation, parameters to monitor, frequency of monitoring, time and \nlocation  of  monitoring,  responsibility,  and  cost  of  monitoring.  Procedures  for  conducting \nenvironmental monitoring are detailed in the summary environmental assessment and review \nframework. Water quality samples must adhere to GOST 17.1.3.07-82 standards. Maximum \nallowable  wastewater  discharge  limits  are  defined  according  to  a  European  Economic \nCommunity directive, No. 91/271/EEC, which has been adopted by the Ministry of Health. The \nenvironmental management plan for all towns will be updated and expanded to include specific \nwater and wastewater quality testing locations and procedures during detailed engineering \ndesign. \n14.  The executing agencies has existing capacity and knowledge to perform water quality \ntests and to monitor environmental mitigation measures. The organization has accumulated \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  management  and  mitigation  experience  through  current  and \ncompleted water and wastewater improvement and construction works throughout Azerbaijan \nand Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The joint stock companies will be trained by AZERSU \nor SAWMA with water quality testing and environmental monitoring. \n15.  A national environmental and social specialist will be hired to undertake capacity building \nfor environmental management and assessment. The staff must also be trained regarding the \nrisks of wastewater treatment operation, construction, chemical handling, and specific water and \nwastewater  network  operations  and  maintenance  tasks.  The  budget  needed  for  these \nenvironmental tasks and typical mitigation measures is included in the summary environmental \nassessment and review framework and the individual IEEs in Appendix 13 and Supplementary \nAppendix H, respectively.  \nF.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n16.  According  to  Azerbaijan  regulation  (which  has  been  adopted  by  the  Nakhchivan \nAutonomous Republic), public consultation for all subprojects has to be carried out twice\u2014first \nat the detailed design stage (to address all important comments) and then at the end of a \nproject when presenting subproject results. ADB also requires public consultation for category B \nprojects where the Borrower must consult with groups affected by a project and with local \n ", "                                                                                                                           Appendix 14   83\nnongovernment  organizations  as  early  as  possible  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). Any grievance redress issues will be resolved according to the \nProgram\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement framework. \n17.  For the two subproject IEEs analyzed herein, ADB conducted public consultations in \neach town between April and August 2003. The social assessment process included project \nhousehold  surveys  (200  people  in  Goychay  and  400  people  in  Nakhchivan),  focus  group \nmeetings, local and executive stakeholder consultations, and informal interviews with vulnerable \nmembers in Azeri. Information gathered included (i) the frequency of delivery of water and \ncollection  of  wastewater,  (ii)  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  charged  to  consumers,  (iii)  the \ncommunity\u2019s willingness to pay for water and wastewater services, and (iv) if town members \nvolunteered to participate in the town water users\u2019 associations. Environmental concerns were \nnoted during public consultations and have been incorporated into the proposed mitigation \nmeasures. The developments and timeline of construction was disclosed to the public.  \nG.  Conclusions \n18.  The  level  of  environmental  assessment  within  this  IEE  is  sufficient  to  indicate  the \nInvestment Program\u2019s impacts and to outline necessary mitigation measures. No additional \nstudies are required. The Investment Program is unlikely to cause any adverse environmental \nimpacts, because (i) potential negative impacts associated with the design, construction, and \noperation of the subproject activities are likely to be temporary and localized in extent and can \nbe mitigated to acceptable levels using proven technology and management measures; and (ii) \nan  environmental  management  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  environmentally  sustainable \nimplementation  of  the  subprojects.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  two  subproject  IEEs,  the \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures, and the subproject selection criteria for the \nInvestment Program, it is likely that subsequent subproject environmental assessment will not \nwarrant a detailed environmental impact assessment. \n \n ", "  8\n4\n \nTable A14.2: Summary of Environmental Impacts, Mitigation Measures and Responsible Institutions    \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPotential Impacts  Proposed Mitigation Measures  Responsible   A\nDesign and Location      p\np\nSource Abstraction  Perform long duration pumping tests or wetted perimeter analyses to confirm abstraction limits during dry seasons  PMO and/or  e\nn\nPMF and  d\nProviding sufficient supply   Confirm river abstractions are not greater than 50% of flow (Water Code, 1998)  JSCs  ix\n \n1\nSource Protection  Provide a protection buffer zone of at least 100 m upstream of river intakes and 30 m surrounding boreholes, (Article  PMO and/or  4\n22 of the Land Code, 1999), and restrict access.
