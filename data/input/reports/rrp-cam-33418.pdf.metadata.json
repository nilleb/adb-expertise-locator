The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity,  1992  defines  biological  diversity \nas  the  variability  among  living  organisms  from  all  sources  including,  among  others,  terrestrial, \nmarine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; the \nterm includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. \n \nBiosphere reserves. Areas of terrestrial and coastal or marine ecosystems, or a combination \nthereof, that are recognized internationally within the framework of the Man and the Biosphere \nProgramme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). \nBiosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under their jurisdiction. \nThe  reserves  must  meet  a  minimal  set  of  criteria  and  adhere  to  a  minimal  set  of  conditions \nbefore  being  admitted  to  UNESCO's  World  Network  of  Biosphere  Reserves.  Each  reserve  is \nintended  to  fulfill  three  complementary  functions:  (i)  a  conservation  function  (preserve \nlandscapes,  ecosystems,  species,  and  genetic  variation);  (ii)  a  development  function  (foster \nsustainable  economic  and  human  development);  and  (iii)  a  logistic  function  (support \ndemonstration  projects,  environmental  education  and  training,  and  research  and  monitoring \nrelated  to  local,  national,  and  global  issues  of  conservation  and  sustainable  development). \nBiosphere  reserves  contain  one  or  more  core  areas,  which  are  securely  protected  sites;  a \nclearly identified buffer zone; and a flexible transition area. \n \nUNESCO. 2002. The MAB Programme. \nAvailable: http://www.unesco.org/mab/ \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nBuffer zone. A zone that usually surrounds or adjoins core areas, and is used for cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation,  ecotourism,  and  applied  and  basic  research.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve \n(TSBR), the buffer zone\u2014an area of about 540,000 hectares (ha)\u2014surrounds the core areas up \nto the outer limit of the flooded forest. \n \nCommunity  management.  The  community-based  management  of  local  natural  resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n \nCore areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems,  and  undertaking  nondestructive  research  and  other  low-impact  uses  such  as \neducation.  In  the  TSBR,  the  core  areas  are  located  in  Prek  Toal  (21,342  ha),  Battambang; \nBoeng Tonle Chhmar (Moat Kla) (14,560 ha), Kompong Thom; and Stung Sen (6,355 ha). The \ncore areas are characterized by a preserved flooded forest, rich river systems, and biodiversity. \nNearly  100  water  bird  species  are  found  there,  a  dozen  of  which  are  of  international \nsignificance.  In  addition  to  fish  stocks,  the  areas  are  known  for  species  such  as  crocodiles, \nturtles, macaques, capped langurs, otters, and water snakes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFishing  gear.  Any  equipment  used  for  fishing.  The  Department  of  Fisheries  in  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries describes over 200 different techniques and gear in use on \nthe Tonle Sap and ranging from large-scale gear such as barrage traps and bag nets; middle-\nscale gear such as arrow -shaped traps, drift seine nets, rafted mounted lift nets, and scooping \nnets; to family-scale gear such as gill nets, small traps, single longlines, small dip nets, and cast \nnets. Almost all are developed locally. \n \nFishing  lots.  Fishing  lots  are  exclusive  geographic  areas  that  are  awarded  through  a \ncompetitive,  public  bidding  system  for  a  period  of  2  consecutive  years,  with  the  auction  fee \npayable  for  each  of  the  two  fishing  seasons.  In  2000,  there  were  175  fishing  lots  throughout \nCambodia.  They  range  in  size  from  2,000  ha  to  50,000  ha  and  may  include  lake  areas,  river \nareas, and flooded forest. The largest are found on the Tonle Sap. The operator of each lot has \nthe right to harvest fish according to the burden book for the lot. The burden book describes the \nopen  season,  the  payment  schedule,  permissible  fishing  gears,  the  boundaries,  the  main \ngeographic  features,  and  the  designated  public  fishing  areas.  Over  half  of  the  fishing  lot  area \nwas withdrawn from the system recently and designated for community-based management. \n \nFish sanctuaries. Eight fish sanctuaries have been established on the Tonle Sap. They are set \naside to protect fish stocks, improve fish recruitment, and provide dry season refuge areas for \nnonmigratory  fish.  Year-round,  fishing  activities,  including  small-scale  fishing,  are  prohibited \nalthough  fishing  for  scientific  purposes  is  allowed.  Seven  of  the  sanctuaries  are  inside  the \npermanent lake, and one is near the mouth of the Tonle Sap River. Most of the sanctuaries are \nfound in the deeper parts of the lake, and none is in the flooded forest. \n \nFlooded  forest.  A  descriptive  term  for  the  particular  natural  vegetation  that  originally  covered \nmost  of  the  Tonle  Sap  floodplain.  It  is  now  characterized  by  low  forest  and  shrubs  that  still \naccount for the productivity of the Tonle Sap. \n \nSeasonal  inundation.  Flooding  that  can  be  as  low  as  8  meters  (m)  above  mean  sea  level \n(amsl) or as high as 12 m amsl. \n \nTransition area. An area in which existing stakeholders work together in a variety of economic \nand other activities to manage and develop sustainably a biosphere reserve's natural resources. \nIn  the  TSBR,  the  transition  area  of  about  900,000  ha  lies  between  the  outer  boundary  of  the \nbuffer zone and Highways No. 5 and No. 6.  \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNOTES \n\nThe  fiscal  year  (FY)  of  the  Government  ends  on  31  December.

The summary \nIEE is a supplementary appendix. \n \nIn  the  last  20  years,  transactions  involving  the  Tonle  Sap's  natural \nresources,  especially  its  fisheries,  have  been  characterized  by  inequity, \nfraud,  widespread \nfrom \nunsustainable patterns of exploitation, and escalating conflict. The Project \nwill  enhance  systems  and  develop  the  capacity  for  natural  resource \nmanagement  coordination  and  planning,  community-based management \nof  natural  resources,  and  conservation  of  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap \nBiosphere Reserve (TSBR). Without those improvements, investments in \nthe Tonle Sap region will become progressively less productive. \n \nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Southeast  Asia  and  has \ndefined  Cambodia's  national  identity.  Fish  from  the  Tonle  Sap  provide \n40\u201370%  of  the  protein  intake  of  Cambodia's  population.  The  lake  is  of \nglobal significance and was nominated as a biosphere reserve in October \n1997  under  the  Man  and  the  Biosphere  Program  of  the  United  Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization.  Yet,  the  natural \nresources of the Tonle Sap are a source of conflict among stakeholders. \nInequality of access rights, growing population pressure, severe poverty, \ninsufficient  or  nonexistent  rights  of  tenure,  and  cultural  and  ethnic \ndifferences  place  the  lake's  ecosystem  and  the  population  that  depends \non  it  at  risk.  The  25  years  of  strife  brought  about  by  the  Khmer  Rouge \nhave  diminished  the  ability  to  tackle  these  issues  at  all  levels  of \nCambodian  society.  In  recent  years,  many  have  become  increasingly \nconcerned  that  development  and  unsustainable  exploitation  of  the  Tonle \nSap's  natural  richness,  especially  clearing  of  the  flooded  forest  for  cash \ncropping  and  illegal  fishing,  threaten  the  Tonle  Sap.  King  Norodom \nSihanouk  has  warned  that  Cambodia  faces  environmental disaster if the \nfragile  ecosystem  of  the  lake  is  further  degraded.  Management  of  the \nTSBR is a great challenge for the Government. Analysis of problems and \nopportunities reveals that: (i) natural resource management coordination \nand  planning  for  the  TSBR  is  weak;  (ii)  communities,  which  have  been \ndesignated  as  key  players,  are  not  organized  for  natural  resource \nmanagement  in  the  TSBR;  and  (iii)  management  capacity  to  conserve \nbiodiversity in the TSBR is inadequate. \n \nThe goal of the Project  is sustainable management and conservation of \nnatural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. The objective is \nto  enhance  systems  and  develop  the  capacity  for  natural  resource \nmanagement  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural \nresource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject \nDescription \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and  duties,  is \nestimated at $19.4 million equivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange of \n$8.8  million  (about  45%)  and  local  currency  of  $10.6  million  equivalent \n(about 55%). \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of  $10.9  million \nequivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance about 56% of the \nproject cost. A Global Environment Facility  (GEF) grant in the amount of \nabout $3.9 million was formulated with the proposed loan. In addition, the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  Capacity  21 \nprogram  will  provide  about  $623,000  as  a  grant.  The  Government  will \nfinance about $3.9 million equivalent in local currency. \n \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of various currencies equivalent to \n$10.9 million from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \nUntil 30 June 2008 \n\n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nThe  overall  project  implementation  period  is  5  years.  A  project  steering \ncommittee  has  been  established  to  advise  on  implementation,  provide  a \nmechanism for resolving implementation problems that go beyond single \nministerial  mandates,  and  review  progress.  A  project  monitoring  and \ncoordination  office  has  been  formed  in  the  TSBR  Secretariat  in  the \nCambodia  National  Mekong  Committee.  Project  implementation  offices \nhave  been  set  up  in  the  Department  of  Fisheries  in  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries; the Ministry of Environment; and the \nTSBR Secretariat. UNDP's office in Phnom Penh will implement the GEF \nand Capacity 21 grants. \n \n\n \nGoods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the loan \nproceeds  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Vehicles,  equipment,  and  material  will  be  procured  by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  more  than  $500,000, \nor by international shopping where the cost is from $100,000 to $500,000. \nVehicles,  equipment,  and  material  valued  at \nthan  $100,000 \nequivalent  may  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB) \nprocedures.  Minor  items  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $50,000  may  be \npurchased directly. Civil works to be financed from the proceeds are small \nand scattered and may be procured under LCB procedures. \n \n \n \n\nless \n\n \n\n \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries \n \nProcurement \n\n\fv \n\nInternational and domestic consultants will support project implementation \nand capacity building. The consultants financed by ADB will be recruited \nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  The  Project  will  also  contract  out  services  to \ninternational  organizations,  international  and  domestic  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and other local institutions. To the extent possible, \nprocurement  will  be  on  the  basis  of  competitive  procedures.  But  where \nthe number of service providers is limited, direct selection will be applied, \nwith  the  prior  approval  of  ADB.  Where  direct  selection  does  not  apply, \nconsultants will be recruited using ADB's quality and cost-based selection \nmethod. \n \nProject  benefits  will  stem  from  improved  coordination  and  planning  for \nnatural  resource  management,  organization  of  communities  for  natural \nresource  management,  and  conservation  of  biodiversity.  Project \nbeneficiaries are members of the communities that will be targeted in the \nfive  provinces  adjoining \nthe  Tonle  Sap\u2014Battambang,  Kompong \nChhnang, Kompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap. Because of the social \ndislocation  that  Cambodia  has  suffered,  working  cooperatively  is  not \neasy.  By  promoting  the  cohesion  of  communities,  the  Project  will  raise \ntheir efficiency and ability to capture investment and enhance the benefits \nthat they derive from fisheries by improving management, protecting core \nareas, and reducing the decline of more valuable species in the medium \nterm.  Clarification  of  natural  resource  use  rights  will  also  reduce  the \nconflicts affecting these communities. Other project beneficiaries are the \nnational,  provincial,  district,  and  field  staff,  as  well  as  NGOs,  who  will \nreceive  a  significant  amount  of  interdisciplinary  and  on-the-job  training \nthat cuts across professional and social boundaries, including gender. At \nthe  global  level,  mankind  will  benefit  from  the  conservation  of  globally \nsignificant  biodiversity,  as  will  all  Cambodians  who  depend  on  fish  for \nprotein. \n \nRisks  that  can  be  mitigated  under  the  Project  pertain  to  the  regulatory \nframework  for  inland  fisheries,  project  coverage,  sectoral  interests, \ncommunity  self-regulation,  and  manpower  availability  and  supervision. \nThe principal assumptions are a strong Government sense of ownership \nof  and  commitment  to  the  Project  and  the  desire  of  the  communities  to \nself-regulate. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  in  the  amount  of \n$540,000  for  Improving  the  Regulatory  and  Management Framework for \nInland  Fisheries.

Owing  to  a \nunique hydrological phenomenon, the Tonle Sap River draining the lake reverses its flow during \nthe  wet  season  when  the  waters  of  the  Mekong  River  flow  into  the  lake  to  inundate  1.0\u20131.6 \nmillion ha for several months each year. 2 The extensive wetlands born of this cycle are home to \na high biodiversity of fish,  reptile, bird, mammal, and plant species.3 This biological richness is \nreflected in the enormous productivity of the Tonle Sap as a fishing area: the lake supports one \nof the most productive capture fisheries in the world,4 and provides 40\u201370% of the protein intake \nof Cambodia's population.5 The fisheries, together with the flooded forest and agricultural lands \nof the inundated area, have underpinned human activity since ancient times. Indeed, the Tonle \nSap and the associated cultural heritage of Angkor have defined Cambodia's national identity.6 \nToday,  the  land,  water,  and  biotic  resources  of  the  Tonle  Sap  directly  benefit  11%  of  the \nCambodian  population  and,  indirectly,  many  more  in  terms  of  food  security.7  The  lake  also \nbenefits  the  lower  Mekong  Basin  as  a  feeding  and  spawning  area  for  both  migratory  and \nnonmigratory fish. It is of global significance for biodiversity conservation (Appendix 2). \n \n3. \nBecause of its biodiversity, economic, and cultural values, the Tonle Sap is a source of \nconflict,  at  times  violent.  Inequality  of  access  rights,  growing  population  pressure,  severe \npoverty, insufficient or nonexistent rights to land tenure, and ethnic differences place the lake's \necosystem  and  the  population  that  depends  on  it  at  risk.  Unfortunately,  25  years  of  strife \nbrought  about  by  the  Khmer  Rouge  have  diminished  at  all  levels  of  Cambodian  society  the \nability  to  tackle  these  issues.  In  recent  years,  concern  over  the  Tonle  Sap  has  grown;  King \n\n                                                 \n1   The Project is included in the Country Strategy and Program, 2003\u20132005 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n\nfor Cambodia (Appendix 2). \n\n2  Consequently, the water level of the lake varies from 1\u20132 meters (m) above mean sea level (amsl) during the dry \n\nseason to 8\u201311 m amsl during the wet season. \n\n3  Many fish species migrate between the Mekong River and the Tonle Sap, utilizing the river for spawning and the \n\nflooded forest for growth and maturation. \n\n4   The  Tonle  Sap  yields  about  230,000  tons  (t)  of  fish  per  annum,  valued  at  $150  million\u2013$200 million (based on \nlanding  data),  of  which  about  25%  is  exported,  primarily  to  Thailand.  The  monetary  value  of  the  catch increases \nthrough  the  marketing  chain  to  $250  million\u2013$500 million. Cambodia\u2019s freshwater capture fisheries production of \nover  400,000  t  per  year  is  the  fourth  largest  in  the  world  after  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  India,  and \nBangladesh.  Some  believe  this  to  be  an  underestimate:  in  2000,  the  National  Institute  of  Statistics  estimated \nproduction at 442,000 t. Freshwater capture fisheries contribute 5\u201310% of Cambodia's gross domestic product. \n5  Nationwide fish consumption ranges from 40 to 70 kilograms (kg) per person per year. It is widely believed that the \n\nTonle Sap provides two thirds of fish consumed in Cambodia. \n\n6  It is on the northwestern shore of the Tonle Sap that Khmer kings built their capital from the 9th to the 13th century. \n7  Cambodia's  population  numbers  about  11.5  million.  The  population  living  in  the  five  provinces  surrounding  the \n\nTonle Sap numbers about 2.9 million. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\nNorodom  Sihanouk  has  warned  that  Cambodia  faces  environmental  disaster  if  the  fragile \necosystem of the lake is degraded further. \n \n4. \nIn recognition of the lake's importance, a Royal Decree designated the Tonle Sap as a \nMultiple-Use  Protected  Area  in  November  1993.  Furthermore,  the  lake  was  nominated  as  a \nBiosphere Reserve in October 1997  under  the  Man  and  the  Biosphere  Program  of  the  United \nNations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO),  when  it  joined  other \nnatural wonders of the world holding that status.8 But management of the Tonle Sap Biosphere \nReserve  (TSBR)  is  a  great  challenge  for  the  Government. 9  At  least,  it  needs  to  improve  the \nregulatory  and  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  build  consensus  and  capacity  for \nintegrated environmental management in line agencies, organize and empower communities to \nmanage natural resources, and develop the capability for biodiversity conservation.10 \n \n\n2. \n\nNatural Resource Management Coordination and Planning \n\n5. \nThe  principal  policy  instruments  for  natural  resource  management  are  the  National \nEnvironmental  Action  Plan,  1998\u20132003;11  Governance  Action  Plan,  2001;  Second \nSocioeconomic  Development  Plan,  2001\u20132005  (prepared  ADB  assistance);12  and  the  draft \nNational  Biodiversity  Strategy  and  Action  Plan.  Other  relevant  legislation  includes  the Law on \nEnvironmental  Protection  and  Natural  Resource  Management,  the  Fiat  Law  on  Fisheries \nManagement  and  Administration  that  is  being  revised,  and  the  Royal  Decree  on  the \nEstablishment  and  Management  of  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  of  April  2001. \nNevertheless, these instruments have not brought about sound management of the Tonle Sap. \nThere  are  no  integrated  policies  at  the  national  level  and  no  systems  or  capacity  for  their \ndevelopment. The Government's recent achievements in decentralization also need support. \n \n6. \nThe  primary  interagency  institution  is  the  Cambodia  National  Mekong  Committee \n(CNMC),  with  a  membership  of  10  ministries  and  a  linkage  with  the  Mekong  River \nCommission.13  In  response  to  the  growing  need  for  coordination  and  planning,  a  TSBR \nSecretariat  was  established  in  CNMC  by  subdecree  in  September  2001.14  Establishment  in \nCNMC  affirms  the  TSBR  Secretariat's  legitimacy  as  the  coordinating  body  for  the  Tonle  Sap \nand,  thereby,  its  influence  in  all  sectors  of  Government.  The  primary  Government  agencies \nresponsible for managing natural resources in the TSBR are the Department of Fisheries (DOF) \n\n                                                 \n8  These numbered 408 in May 2002. \n9   The Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) aims to fulfill three complementary functions. They are: (i) conservation \nof landscapes, ecosystems, and species diversity; (ii) culturally, socially, and ecologically sustainable development; \nand  (iii)  research,  monitoring,  and  education.  Management  of  the  TSBR  should  be  based  on  zoning  into  core \nareas, a buffer zone, and a transition area. \n\n10 Cambodia's obligations vis -\u00e0-vis the Tonle Sap are embodied in more than 10 treaties and conventions, including \nthe Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (the Ramsar Convention), \n1971; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), 1979; and \nthe  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity,  1992.  One  of  the  core  areas  of  the  TSBR,  Boeng  Tonle  Chhmar, was \ndesignated as one of the country's three Ramsar sites in 1999. \n\n11 The Tonle Sap is flagged as a priority in the National Environmental Action Plan, 1998\u20132002. \n12 The National Assembly passed the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001\u20132005 on 17 June 2002. The \n\nSenate approved it on 8 July 2002. \n\n13 CNMC's  role  is  to  advise  the  Government  on  all  matters  related  to  the  formulation  of  water  policy,  strategy, \nmanagement,  preservation,  investigation,  planning,  and  restoration  and  the  development  of  the  water  and  other \nnatural resources of the Mekong River Basin within Cambodia. \n\n14 The  Subdecree  on  the  Establishment,  Role,  and  Functions  of  the  Secretariat  of  the  TSBR  of  September  2001 \nstructured the TSBR Secretariat into three divisions for policy, strategy, and networking; research, monitoring, and \ndata management; and administration and training. The TSBR Secretariat's staff numbers 6 out of a total planned \ncomplement of 15. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\nin the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF), and the Ministry of Environment \n(MOE).  However,  their  policies  are  uncoordinated  and  broad  in  focus.  For  example,  the  draft \nFisheries  Law  (prepared  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank)  provides  long-term  goals  for \nmanaging  fisheries  in  the  Tonle  Sap  but  it  remains  to  be  completed.  Associated  legislation, \ncomplemented and influenced by a fisheries management framework, is essential. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity and Lot Fisheries \n\nOn  the  Tonle  Sap,  fishing  is  carried  out  for  commercial  and  subsistence  purposes. \n7. \nCommercial  fisheries  have  been  organized  under  a  system  of  exclusive  spatial  and temporal \nuse  rights  of  auctioned  (large-scale)  lots.15  However,  the  system  focuses  on  revenue \ngeneration, instead of sustainable resource extraction and equitable rural development, and has \nexacerbated  conflict  in  proportion  with  increasing  population  pressures16  and  economic \ndemands.17 What is more, managing the fishing lot system has always been difficult because of \nthe  opacity  of  the  auction  system  and  the  unrestricted  power  of  fishing  lot  operators.  In \nresponse,  in  October  2000,  a  Prime  Ministerial  decree  released  56%  (or  500,000  ha)  of  the \nformer  fishing  lot  area  to  communities  for  management.18  There  are  now  more  than  160 \ndesignated community fisheries (or 300 management units) in the fishing lot area released from \ncommercial  fisheries.  (The  identification  of  areas  for  community  management  has  resulted  in \nmany cases in the less productive grounds being released.) Community-based management of \nfisheries resources is bound to play an essential role in better sector performance.19 But policy \nreform  is  no  guarantee  of  better  management  without  accompanying  improvements  in \ntransparency,  information,  and  implementation.  The  fishing  lots  were  released  to  communities \nwithout regulatory or management structure, funding, or training to support the establishment of \ncommunity  fisheries  in  these  areas.  The  lots  have  become,  de  facto,  open  access  areas.  The \nresults  are  confusion  over  access  rights,  alleged  uncontrolled  exploitation,  rampant \nirresponsible fishing, and further conflict. \n \nOn  the  Tonle  Sap,  fishers  inhabit  floating  villages  (which  move  with  changing  water \n8. \nlevels) or raised houses in resident communities along the lakeshore.20 Outside the inundated \narea, in the five provinces adjoining the Tonle Sap, livelihood systems are based on low-yield, \nrain-fed  paddy  production  in  the  wet  season.  At  this  level  of  subsistence,  communities  are \ndriven to supplement livelihoods with firewood collection or illegal dry season crop production. \nAs a result, the flooded forest that provides the basis for the Tonle Sap's productive fisheries is \ndisappearing in the face of short-term, low-productivity, and low-value activities. \n \n\n                                                 \n15 The  lots,  which  until  recently  numbered  57  and  occupied  about  940,000  ha  of  the  most  productive  fishing  areas \n(including those on the Tonle Sap River), are based on auctions of the resource in a defined area every 2 years. \n16 Cambodia has a fast-growing population (4% per annum during 1994\u20131998) of which 54% are under the age of 20. \n17 Even so, the Government should benefit from the vast potential rent to be derived from the fishing lots. However, in \n\n2000, DOF collected less than $3 million in concession fees. \n\n18 In conjunction with local authorities, they are to manage, conserve, and use the fisheries sustainably. \n19 The benefits of community-based management follow: (i) fishers cooperate in planning to increase or conserve fish \nstocks; (ii) fishers share the costs and benefits of improved management; (iii) there is better conflict management; \n(iv)  the  position  of  fishers  vis-\u00e0-vis  other  stakeholders  is  enhanced  by  their  being  organized;  (v)  fishers  and  the \nGovernment  are  willing  to  share  data  on  and  their  understanding  of  the  fisheries  resources;  (vi)  fishers  are \nencouraged to adopt a longer perspective; and (vii) enforcement of rules is more effective since they have a high \nlevel of acceptance: accordingly, compliance and self-regulation are high. \n\n20 Together, they make up 25% of the 1.2 million people living in the area bounded by Highways No. 5 and No. 6. It is \n\nnot possible to distinguish between fishers and farmers. Most people are engaged in both activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n4. \n\nPoverty and the Tonle Sap \n\n9. \nFive  provinces  adjoin  the  Tonle  Sap.  They  are  Battambang,  Kompong  Chhnang, \nKompong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap.  Despite  the  vast  natural  wealth  of  the  Tonle  Sap, \npoverty  is  widespread:  about  38%  of  the  population  living  in  the  five  provinces  fall  under  the \nofficial poverty line, the highest proportion in the country.21 Around 50% of the villages have 40\u2013\n60% of households living below the poverty line, with a peak of 80% in some rural areas of Siem \nReap  and  Kompong  Chhnang.  Poverty  is  related  to  extended  instability  and  conflict,  and  the \nresultant  harm  to  the  population;  most  of  Cambodia  experienced  more  peace  and economic \ngrowth after 1993, but only since 1998 have areas northwest of the Tonle Sap enjoyed their first \nreal respite from war. Many internally displaced persons, repatriated refugees, internal migrants, \nand  demobilized  soldiers  are  busy  reestablishing  their livelihoods in what remains a fractured \nsociety.22 \n \n10. \nThe inhabitants of the Tonle Sap region receive little schooling. Statistics report an adult \nliteracy rate of about 46% (a figure considered to be inflated as it includes the partially literate), \ncompared with the national average of 63%. The school attendance of children aged 5\u201314 years \nis only 63%, compared with the national average of 67%. Lack of education limits the ability to \nrecognize and take opportunities. Low literacy levels, lack of access to environmental education \nmaterials (such as posters and books), and dearth of basic information (such as copies of laws, \nsubdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars) are not propitious to decision making for \nnatural resource management. \n \n11.  Women  constitute  about  51%  of  the  population  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  Significantly, \nthey  also  head  about  15\u201330%  of  households.  Female  heads  of  households  must  both  earn \nincome  and  look  after  young  families.  They  have  few  opportunities  for  participating  in \ncommunity  decision  making  since  Khmer  tradition  ascribes  a  passive  role  to  women. \nNevertheless,  the  gender  division  of  labor  is  changing  overall:  women  and  men  play \nprogressively  interchangeable  roles  because  women  are  increasingly  called  upon  to  meet \nhousehold needs. In the floating villages, they construct fishing gear and process and sell fish. \nIn  land-based villages, they are actively involved in rice and vegetable production, trading, and \nforest-based activities (including firewood collection), and also in fish processing and sale. In the \nlatter  villages,  there  is  nonetheless  a  growing  trend  toward  landlessness  for  households  with \nfemale  heads  because  of  lack  of  capital  and  sudden  shocks,  including  health  problems. \nNonparticipation in community decision making, scarce opportunities for self-development, and \ninadequate access to financial services keep the women poor. \n \n12. \nThe  ethnic  minorities  of  the  Tonle  Sap  region  are  the  Vietnamese  and  Muslim  Cham. \nEven  though  most  of  the  Vietnamese  were  born  in  Cambodia,  they  do  not  have  Khmer \nnationality  and  are  classified  as  immigrants.  This  status  and  the  historical  animosity  between \nthem  and  the  Khmers  constrain  the  Vietnamese  contribution  to  community-based  natural \nresource management.23 Still, they are among the most innovative of fishers. The Cham too are \nfishers. But they do not experience segregation despite their conspicuous identity. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 The poverty line is the per capita expenditure needed to secure an intake of 2,100 calories per day. \n22 Social cohesion between groups is still low. Intrinsically,  Khmer society lacks organized groups or structures above \nthe  family  group.  The  traditionally  hierarchical  nature  of  working  arrangements,  ethnic  differences,  collective \ntrauma from the Khmer Rouge regime, migration associated with seasonal flooding, as well as income disparities \ndemand special efforts at community organization. \n\n23 The  Vietnamese  number  about  100,000  nationwide.  The  Cham,  who  have  lived  in  Cambodia  since  the  15th \n\ncentury, number 300,000\u2013400,000 in total. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n5\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities24 \n\n13.  Analysis of key problems and opportunities reveals that: (i) natural resource management \ncoordination and planning for the TSBR is weak; (ii) communities that have been designated as \nkey  players  are  not  organized  for  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR;  and  (iii) \nmanagement capacity for biodiversity conservation in the TSBR is inadequate (Appendix 3). \n \n\n1. \n\nFish Stocks and Habitats \n\n14. \nIncomplete  and  fragmented  data  has  hidden  the  decline  of  inland  fisheries.  Still, \nestimates  of  annual  fish  catches  have  improved  since  1998  because  of  Danish  International \nDevelopment Agency and Mekong River Commission assistance to DOF. Total catch may not \nbe falling due to the ever-increasing fishing effort (though the catch per fisher is). However, the \nshare of large and medium-size, higher-value fish has declined because of the longer time such \nfish  need  to  reach  maturity;  intensive  fishing;  and  inadequate  regulation  of  fishing  techniques \nand  gear.  Thus,  a  higher  proportion  of  the  total  catch  now  comprises  small  fish  used  for \nfishmeal  and  fermented  fish  paste  production.  Crucially,  in  addition  to  the  irresponsible  fishing \ntechniques used, the flooded forest that provides breeding and feeding grounds for all fish and \nmuch of the lake's primary productivity is being destroyed. The flooded forest originally covered \nmore  than  1  million  ha;  it  had  shrunk  to  about  610,000  ha  by  the  1960s  and  now  covers  only \nabout  362,000  ha  (much  of  which  consists  of  shrubland  and  secondary  scrub  with  few  trees). \nAlthough  clearing  and  dry  season  burning  for  agricultural  purposes  is  significant,  the  main \nproblem is firewood collection for both domestic use and local industries.25 \n \nThe  Tonle  Sap  is  most  likely  being  exploited  beyond  sustainable  limits.  Further \n15. \ndeterioration  may  have  unpredictable  consequences  because  capture fisheries do not usually \ndecline at regular linear rates; they can collapse suddenly due to irreversible damage to parts of \nthe  ecosystem  or  overfishing.  Such  a  collapse  would  have  serious  social  and  welfare \nconsequences:  fish  provides  most  of  the  protein  in  the  diet  of  Cambodians  and  its  sales \nsupplement  income  for  the  purchase  of  rice,  especially  in  times  of  distress  brought  about  by \ndrought,  pest  outbreaks,  or  floods.26 Many of the large indigenous species of fish such as the \ngiant Mekong River catfish (Pangasianodon gigas) and aquatic mammals such as the Irrawaddy \ndolphin  (Orcaella  brevirostris)  are  already  endangered.  Also,  collection  of  eggs  and  chicks \naggravates  the  threat  to  several  species  of  waterfowl  of  global  significance.27  The  impact  of \nintroduced  exotic  species  such  as  giant  mimosa  (Mimosa  pigra),  water  hyacinth  (Eichhornia \ncrassipes), nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and some carps on the native flora and fauna of \nthe Tonle Sap is unknown; however, their potential threat should be researched. \n \n\n2. \n\nNatural Resource Management Coordination and Planning \n\nPolicy  on  natural  resource  management  has  emphasized  sectoral  priorities,  but \n16. \ninterministerial  coordination  is  weak.  The  existing  framework  shows  many  problems  including \noverlapping  mandates,  uneven  implementation,  inadequate  monitoring  and  enforcement, \n\n                                                 \n24 See also  Feast or Famine? Solutions  to  Cambodia's  Fisheries  Conflicts.  2001.  A  Report  by  the  Fisheries  Action \n\nCoalition Team in Collaboration with the Environmental Justice Foundation. \n\n25 Firewood and charcoal remain the main source of energy for up to 97% of households nationally, particularly in the \nrural areas. The demand for firewood and charcoal is predicted to grow. The Cambodia Fuelwood Saving Project in \nKompong Chhnang, funded by the Food and Agriculture of the United Nations (FAO), demonstrated that efficiency \nimprovements of up to 50% are attainable through improved design of cooking stoves. \n26 Rice is a feature of the Cambodian diet. Fishers need 5\u20137 kg of fish to buy 1 kg of rice. \n27 Estimates of the numbers taken annually reach many thousands. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\ninconsistent  permit  and  registration  systems,  irregularities  in  financial  management,  and \nabsence of consistent mechanisms to declare and manage core areas. The Government has no \ncoordinated  management  plan  for  multiple  use  of  the  lake  and  the  need  to  develop  common \npolicy objectives for managing the TSBR is acutely felt. There is hope that the TSBR Secretariat \nwill  facilitate  coordination  and  fortify  cooperation  among  national  agencies,  provincial \nauthorities,  and  civil  society.  The  secretariat\u2019s  authority  is  equal  to  that  of  a  ministerial \ndepartment.  Its  purposes  are  to:  (i)  serve  as  an  information  clearinghouse  open  to  all;  (ii) \nconduct a nationwide awareness and mobilization campaign for the protection and sustainable \nuse  of  the  Tonle  Sap  and  its  watershed;  and  (iii)  effect  cross-sectoral  policy  and  strategy \ncoordination. However, the secretariat is new and must be strengthened. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Fisheries \n\n17. \nFish  stock  depletion  and  habitat  destruction  could  be  slowed,  even  reversed,  if \ncommunities  had  a  sense  of  ownership  and  could  self-regulate  better.28  But  community-level \nmanagement  systems  and  capacity  are  weak  or  nonexistent.  Conflict  resolution  mechanisms \ncannot prevent violent interventions because communities and individuals have few incentives \nto act responsibly. Legal instruments such as the Fisheries Law and the Wildlife Protection Law \nhave  been  drafted  but  await  public  consultation  and  approval  by  the  National  Assembly.29 \nCommunity fisheries have been created by prime ministerial decree, not because of stakeholder \nparticipation and empowerment. By the same token, DOF's Community Fisheries Development \nOffice (CFDO) was established only recently and offers no standards and guidelines from which \ncommunity  fisheries  could  develop  local  approaches  to  natural  resource  management  that \naccommodate  ecosystem -wide  considerations.  The  Government's  endeavors  to  engage \ncommunities in natural resource management should shift further from a fish-production focus to \na people focus, where the needs and aspirations of the communities are listened to and valued. \n \n\n4. \n\nResource Tenure \n\n18. \nThe  Land  Law  (prepared  with  ADB  assistance)  addresses  outstanding  issues  on  land \npolicy by establishing basic access of rural people to private tenure over land. In the five project \nprovinces,  with  large  areas  having  natural  resources  used  by  communities,  a  system  for \ndefining  the  user  rights  of  communities  is  also  required.  In  instances,  such  rights  will be both \nspatial  and  temporal:  different  communities  will  often  share  rights  over  forestry  and  fisheries. \nThe World Bank has begun to implement a land-titling project; however, the Tonle Sap region is \nnot one of its priorities. Conflict over fisheries is escalating; it will become worse if communities \ndo not have documentation certifying the right of occupancy or use of natural resources. Conflict \ncan be reduced by mapping, physical demarcation where relevant, and land use planning.30 But \nthe socialization of boundaries is complex and requires long-term commitment. \n\n                                                 \n28 Generally,  management  of  natural  resources  by  strengthened  communities  leads  to  equitable  distribution  of \nbenefits and sustainable use. Still, this assumes that overexploitation has not locked natural resources into terminal \ndecline and made concern for food security paramount to the detriment of the environment. \n\n29 The broad objectives of the Wildlife Protection Law are to provide a clear regulatory framework for management, \nuse, and conservation of wildlife and habitat; establish the management authorities for wildlife issues and specify \ntheir duties and functions; define the prohibited and permitted activities and procedures regarding wildlife use; list \nthe offenses, penalties and enforcement procedures; implement certain provisions of CITES; establish the lists of \nendangered and vulnerable wildlife species in Cambodia; and promote education and awareness of wildlife issues. \nIf the law comes into effect and is enforced, the regulation framework for wildlife conservation will suffice for most \nspecies and areas of the TSBR. However, key biodiversity areas will require vigilance and a targeted enforcement \nprogram. They are the three core areas of the TSBR and additional areas that may need to be identified, given the \nmigratory nature of some wildlife species. \n\n30 Maps help local people to locate their own resources and management needs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \n\n \n\n \n7\n\n19. \nThe  primary  focus  of  the  Fisheries  Law  as  regards  inland  fisheries  management  is  the \nfishing lot system. But policy needs to consider the sustainability of fisheries and the equitable \nsharing of its benefits. It should also give weight to the biodiversity of the core areas and buffer \nzone. Importantly, policy should be developed using participatory techniques. Its technical focus \nshould  include  concern  for:  (i)  the  conservation  and  protection  of  aquatic  habitats  on  the \nfloodplains; (ii) enforcement of fisheries legislation to avoid overharvesting; (iii) monitoring of fish \ncatch and the status of fish and wildlife habitats; (iv) community land rights and land use within \nthe buffer zone; (v) technical reevaluation of the location of existing fish sanctuaries and fishing \nlot boundaries; and (vi) making up the fishing lot system more transparent. \n \n20. \nSubdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars will be  required to implement the \nFisheries Law. All need to be drafted for relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity.  Those \nthat  relate  to  community  fisheries  management  and  reform  of  the  auction  system  and  burden \nbooks are expected to be implemented before adoption of the Fisheries Law. The subdecree on \nestablishment of community fisheries, for example, has been circulated for public comment and \nredrafted  for  submission  to  the  Council  of  Ministers.  It  proposes  to  establish  a  framework  for \ncommunity-based  management,  in  cooperation  with  technical  institutions  and  others  entities. \nThe  subdecree  relating  to  the  auction  system  and  reform  of  the  burden  books  is  expected  to \nimprove  management  of  the  remaining  lots  and  make  the  process  more  transparent.  But  the \nagenda  for  reform  is  placing  a  considerable  burden  on  DOF,  which  already  suffers  from \ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  low  levels  of  capacity.31  Urgently,  the  subdecree  on  establishing \ncommunity fisheries needs to be reexamined from the following perspectives: \n\nLimiting  community-based  fisheries  management  to  family-scale  fishing. \nThe  definition  of  family-scale  fishing  in  the  Fisheries  Law  has  become  obsolete \nand does not provide a realistic tool for present-day fisheries management. Most \nfamily-scale fishers complain  that  they  cannot  catch  enough  fish  and  must  use \nmiddle-scale  fishing  gear.  Their  activities  would  therefore  be  officially  excluded \nfrom  community-based  management  areas  and  they  would  in  all  likelihood \ncontinue  to  fish  there  illegally.  The  definition  of  family-scale  fishing  should  be \nreviewed  promptly  to  decriminalize  people  attempting  to  provide  for  their \nfamilies. The  proposed  subdecree  does  not  provide  incentives  to  embrace \ncommunity fisheries. Community-based fisheries management should include all \nforms  of  fisheries  and  involve  all  stakeholders  within  the  framework  of  a  5-year \nTonle Sap fisheries management plan. \nExcluding  participants  other  than  Khmer  nationals.  The  status  of  the \nVietnamese minority, born in Cambodia but without valid documentation showing \nCambodian nationality, is not clear. Such households live on and fish in the Tonle \nSap  and  would  need  to  participate  in  community  fisheries  management.  The \nstatus of this minority should be examined and ways should be found to address \ntheir need for access and full participation in community fisheries. \nThe  requirements  for  registration.  The  registration  formalities  required  from \ncommunity fisheries need to be simplified with respect to statutes and bylaws. \n\n21.  Work  on  the  regulatory  framework  is  also  hampered  by  the  absence  of  a  fisheries \nmanagement  plan  for  the  Tonle  Sap  and  an  institutional  anchor  for  it.  The  preparation  and \n\n                                                 \n31 In 2000, only 33 fishery officers out of a total staff of 1,557 held postgraduate degrees. About 310 held first degrees \n\nand 479 held diplomas or had received certificate-level training. Salaries do not provide encouragement. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\nregular  updating  of  fisheries  management  plans  is  a  legal  requirement  in  many  countries:  it \ncomplements and influences the regulatory framework in a dynamic and adaptive manner. \n \n\n6. \n\nVulnerable Groups \n\n22. \nVulnerable  groups  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region  include  the  distinct  Vietnamese  and  Cham \nminorities, widows, and other female heads of households. Poverty does not distinguish gender, \nbut  households  headed  by  women  or  those  lacking  male  labor  are  disadvantaged  and  have \nlimited  opportunities  compared  with  poor  households  with  male  heads.  In  such  situations, \nwidows  not  only  have  to  satisfy  the  household\u2019s  needs  but  must  also care for young children. \nThis group alone represents 14.6% of total households in the rural areas of the five provinces \nadjoining the Tonle Sap.32 It is necessary to engage these groups in managing the Tonle Sap: \ntheir vulnerability marginalizes them from decision making and undervalues their contribution to \nthe economy. These stakeholders would also include the population living in the core areas, for \nwhom  no  resettlement  is  envisaged  under  the  Royal  Decree  on  the  Establishment  and \nManagement of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT33 \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n23. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  Its  objective  is  to  enhance  systems  and \ndevelop the capacity for natural resource management coordination and planning, community-\nbased natural resource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR (Appendix 1). \n \n24. \nThe  project  area  encompasses  the  TSBR  and  parts  of  the  five  adjoining  provinces. It \ncomprises  the  core  areas,  the  buffer  zone,  and  the  transition  area  that  extends  to  and  is \nultimately bounded by Highways No. 5 and No. 6. In 1998, about 2.9 million people lived in the \nproject area, of whom about 38% were below the poverty line. About 10% depended wholly on \nfishing  and  about  40%  had  fishing  as  a  secondary  occupation.  More  than  1.2  million  people \nlived in the area bordered by the highways; the population of the core areas was estimated at \n4,200 and that of the buffer zone at 66,000.34 \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nTo  accomplish  its  objective,  the  Project  has  three  closely  interrelated  components: \n25. \n(i) strengthening  natural  resource  management  coordination  and  planning  for  the  TSBR;  (ii) \norganizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR;  and  (iii)  building \nmanagement capacity for biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. \n \n\n                                                 \n32 Siem Reap Province, for instance, has a high percentage of households headed by females (30%), of which 63% \n\nare headed by widows. \n\n33 See also Asian Development Bank. 2001.  Environments in Transition: Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Viet Nam . \nThe  strategy  advocated  for  supporting  sound  management  of  the  Tonle  Sap  rests  on  four  building  blocks:  (i)  a \npolicy  of  gradually  improving  the  system  of  fisheries  management  on  the  lake;  (ii)  consideration  of  the \ninterdependence of activities in the inundated zone and those in further fields; (iii) recognition of the multiplicity of \nprojects  assisted  by  funding  agencies  around  the  Tonle  Sap,  and  the  extent  to  which  synergy  can  be  generated \namong the various initiatives; and (iv) greater institutional coherence in managing the Tonle Sap. \n\n34 The estimated populations in the core areas were 2,970 in  Prek Toal, 695 in Boeng Tonle Chhmar  (Moat Kla), and \n\n545 in Stung Sen. These numbers are expected to total 5,655 in 2010. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n9\n\n1. \n\nStrengthening  Natural  Resource  Management  Coordination  and  Planning \nfor the TSBR \n\nEstablishing  a  Coordination  Framework  and \n\n26. \nInformation  Dissemination \nMechanisms.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  TSBR  Secretariat.  It  will  create  the  capacity  to \naddress  legal  and  coordination  issues  in  the  TSBR,  rationalize  the  designation  of  the  various \nprotected  areas  in  the  TSBR,  and  formulate  common  policy  objectives  for  managing  the \nTSBR.35  The  issues  include  agricultural  and  fisheries  practices  (especially  pesticides), \nhazardous  goods  transport,  solid  waste  management,  and  ecotourism.  The  common  policy \nobjectives will be formulated by the TSBR Secretariat through quarterly interministerial meetings \ncalled and chaired by CNMC.36 The Project will also develop a TSBR Environmental Information \nDatabase (TSBR-ED) to support the secretariat's role as an information clearinghouse open to \nall.  UNESCO  will  be  appointed  by  direct  selection  to  develop  the  TSBR-ED  (Appendix  5).37 \nUNESCO  will  also  be  appointed  by  direct  selection  to  formulate  and  implement  a  national \nenvironmental education and awareness campaign (Appendix 6).38 \n \n27.  Mapping the TSBR. The Project will prepare orthophotomaps at scale 1:5,000 from new \naerial  photographs  at  scale  1:25,000.39  With  the  help  of  aerial  photographs,  orthophotomaps, \nand  additional  satellite  imagery  as  required,  the  TSBR  will  be  mapped  to  delineate  biosphere \nzonation  (i.e.,  core  areas,  buffer  zone,  and  transition  area);  boundaries  of  commercial  and \ncommunity fishing lots, fish sanctuaries, and administrative regions; and physiographic features \n(i.e., inundated areas, vegetation types, and agricultural areas).40 \n \n28. \nImproving Regulation and Management Planning. The Project will prepare, complete, \nor, as necessary, amend the Fisheries Law and the subdecrees, proclamations, and directives \nor circulars associated with it, giving early attention to the subdecree on community fisheries.41 \nIt  will  also  prepare  a  5-year  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  and  set  standards  and \nguidelines  for  formulating  community  and  commercial  fisheries  management  plans,  to  be \ndisseminated  by  DOF.42  The  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  will  include  measures \nurgently  needed  to  halt  destructive  practices.  Later,  under  the  Project,  the  management  plans \nwill  be  integrated  in  the  common  policy  objectives  to  underpin  sustainable  management  and \n\n                                                 \n35 The  common  policy  objectives  will  delineate  an  interministerial  vision  for  sustainable  management  and \n\nconservation of natural resources and biodiversity. \n\n36 This  will  require:  (i)  defining  the  common  policy  objectives;  (ii)  identifying  stakeholders;  (iii)  developing  the  most \nefficient  strategy  to  elicit  comments  from  and  disseminating  information  to  each  group  of  stakeholders;  (iv) \nconsulting at the ministerial level to ensure that sectoral interests are considered and made consistent with other \nnational policies; (v) consulting at the provincial level to ensure that the common policy objectives are relevant and \nimplementable; and (vi) disseminating the common policy objectives to stakeholders. \n\n37 UNESCO's  Man  and  the  Biosphere  Programme  has  a  major  physical  presence  through  the  World  Network  of \nBiosphere  Reserves.  UNESCO  will  build  linkages  with  the  TSBR  Secretariat  through  web  site  development, \nperiodic newsletters, and special publications. \n\n38 UNESCO  will  work  with  MOE,  the  National  Commission  for  UNESCO,  schoolteachers,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to develop the campaign. UNESCO will organize environmental tours; short and interactive \nlectures  on  environment,  ecology,  hydrology,  and  the  natural  wonders  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  drawing  and  painting \ncompetitions; exhibition of pictures; and participatory activities such as tree planting. \n\n39 Because weather conditions make it impractical to fly conventional aerial photography when the lake is at its lowest \n\nlevel, a mixture of conventional aerial and laser photography will be used. \n\n40 This  project  activity  should  be  carried  out  in  full  consultation  with  the  Ministry  of  Land  Management,  Urban \n\nPlanning, and Construction. \n\n41 The new fisheries legislation will be completed with reference to FAO's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. \n42 To  embody  local  approaches  to  natural  resource  management  and  yet  accommodate  ecosystem -wide \nconsiderations, such plans could: (i) define the rights and obligations of the community; (ii) develop procedures for \ncommunities  and  legal  authorities  to  cooperate  in  natural  resource  management  and  conflict  resolution;  (iii) \ndevelop systems to share information; and (iv) map out approaches to community funding of pilot projects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\nconservation of natural resources and biodiversity in the TSBR. To implement the management \nplan  and  make  possible  its  updating,  the  Project  will  establish  a  Tonle  Sap  fisheries \nmanagement  task  force  within  DOF  and  build  it  with  on-the-job  training.  The  Project  will  also \nassist CFDO to better fulfill its role of organizing communities for natural resource management. \n \n\n2. \n\nOrganizing Communities for Natural Resource Management in the TSBR43 \n\nFormulating  an \n\n29. \nImplementation  Structure.  The  Project  will  review  previous \napproaches  to  the  community  organization  for  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR, \nrefine  a  preferred  approach  in  consultation  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and \ndetail  project  activities  to  organize  communities  for  natural  resource  management.  In  each \nproject province, it will also train staff of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries \n(DAFF), the Department of Environment (DOE), and the NGOs needed to support community-\nbased natural resource management. After collecting baseline information on the communities, \nthe Project will define a methodology for prioritizing them. The criteria may include expressions \nof interest, commitment, extent of environmental degradation, and occurrence of conflict.44 \n \n30. \nEmpowering  Communities.  The  trained  provincial  staff  and  trained  NGOs  will  then \nactivate  commune  councils  and  appropriate  village-level  structures  (such  as  the  village \ndevelopment  committees)  for  community-based  natural  resource  management.  Using  the \northophotomaps,  through  a  participatory  process  facilitated  by  the  contracted  NGOs,  the \nboundaries  of  community  fisheries  and  forestry  areas  will  be  mapped.  Boundaries  that  do  not \nbring equitable social and economic benefits to the communities will be revised by agreement \namong the stakeholders, with an eye to environmental protection. The community organization \nactivities  that  they  will  implement  in  about  10\u201312  communities  per  province  per  year  will \ncomprise workshops, training of trainers, and social networking. Led by the community fisheries \ndevelopment  units,  the  provincial  offices  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries,  and  DOEs,  in \nconsultation  with  NGOs,  will  also  encourage  communities  to  formulate  natural  resource \nmanagement plans (Appendix 7). \n \n31. \nEvaluating Technical Packages in Support of Sustainable Livelihoods. The Project \nwill survey previous and ongoing approaches to the development of technical packages based \non sustainable natural resource management and recommend selected packages for replication \nor further development. These may include: (i) enhancing fish productivity through hatcheries or \nimproved fishing gear design; (ii) enhancing forestry productivity through nurseries, agroforestry, \nand  roadside  or  village  plantings;  (iii)  improved  technologies  for  value-adding  for  fish  and \nforestry products; and (iv) disseminating fuel-efficient stoves.45 \n                                                 \n43 FAO will be engaged by direct selection to provide long-term advisory support to this component. With finance from \nthe  Government  of  Belgium,  since  1995,  FAO  has  pioneered  a  project  for  Participatory  Natural  Resources \nManagement in the Tonle Sap Region. The first phase (1995\u20131998) conducted research and data collection on the \nflora  and  fauna  of  the  flooded  fores t  ecosystem  as  well  as  the  socioeconomics  of  fishing  and  border  zone \nagricultural  communities.  Forest  resource  management  trials  were  initiated.  The  second  phase  (1998\u20132001) \nfocused on developing and implementing forest resources management by local communities within the Tonle Sap \necosystem but including activities in the surrounding rain-fed agriculture and upland areas. The project's activities \nfor  community-based  natural  resource  management  have  focused  on  community  forestry  mainly  in  upland  forest \nareas, but some sites have also been involved in community organization in flooded forest areas within the TSBR. \nA  third  phase  (2001\u20132003)  focuses  on  expanding  successful  trials  for  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement  and  beginning  trials  with  community  fisheries,  taking  advantage  of  recent  reforms  in  fisheries \nmanagement. Throughout, emphasis has been on supporting provincial line agencies. \n\n44 The fishing lot released for community fisheries in Banteay Meanchey will be considered in the selection process. \n\nAny project activity in that lot would be handled from Battambang. \n\n45 Possibilities may exist for broad-scale application of select packages with financial support from the Japan Fund for \n\nPoverty Reduction. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n11\n\n3. \n\nBuilding Management Capacity for Biodiversity Conservation in the TSBR \n\n32. \nEnhancing Management Capacity. The Project will establish and equip protected area \nmanagement  units  in  Battambang  and  Kompong  Thom  towns  building  on  existing  MOE \nfacilities. In the three core areas of the TSBR, the Project will also establish and equip core area \nmanagement  centers  that  will  additionally  serve  as  visitor  centers.  The  Project  will  institute  a \nprocess  for  identifying  additional  core  areas  within  the  TSBR,  including  areas  important  for \npreserving  biodiversity  such  as  fish  sanctuaries.  This  will  necessitate  establishment  of \nstandardized procedures for specifying the types of protected areas within the TSBR, reviewing \nthe existing core areas and fish sanctuaries, and harmonizing specifications. Supporting these \nactivities  will  be  a  training  needs  analysis,  and  implementation  of  staff  training  programs  in \nprotected area and biodiversity management. \n \n33. \nDeveloping  Systems  for  Monitoring  and  Management.  The  Project  will  design  and \nimplement  a  biodiversity  monitoring  system  for  the  TSBR,  targeting  in  particular  indicator \nspecies  of  water  birds  and  fish.  It  will  establish  a  rapid  response  mechanism  for  seasonal \nprotection  of  biodiversity,  especially  in  fish  sanctuaries  and  Prek  Toal,  but  also  at  other \npromising  sites  in  the  TSBR.46  Further,  it  will  develop  a  strategy  and  carry  out  an  awareness \ncampaign for the control of exotic species, and conduct trials for eradicating or managing them. \nThe Project will also develop and implement a strategy to better enforce laws and regulations in \nand  around  the  core  areas  and  other  important  sites  that  may  be  identified  in  the  TSBR  to \nprotect  biodiversity  and  natural  habitats.  Lastly,  the  Project  will  identify  income-generation \nactivities that directly threaten biodiversity in the core areas and develop alternative livelihoods \nfor both migrants and permanent inhabitants so as to modify those activities. \n \n34. \nPromoting  Biodiversity  Conservation  Awareness,  Education,  and  Outreach. The \nProject  will  develop  and  implement  an  environmental  awareness,  education,  and  outreach \nprogram  (EAEOP)  for  the  TSBR  that  builds  on  previous,  ongoing,  and  planned  activities  of \nGovernment  agencies  and  NGOs.  The  EAEOP  will  include  the  provision  of  about  four  floating \nenvironmental education centers for regular extension services to villages around the TSBR.47 \nThe  Project  will  also  ensure  that  the  Department  of  Education  and  Communication  in  MOE \nliaises with the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports (MOEYS) to integrate the EAEOP into \nselected schools as part of the cluster schools program. Further, efforts will be made to include \nenvironmental  awareness  in  the  programs  of  religious  groups  and  promote  the  National \nEnvironment Day to the population of the Tonle Sap region. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n35. \nStrategic  Planning. Sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources \nand biodiversity should be considered from the perspective of the basin feeding the Tonle Sap. \nIn keeping with this outlook, the Project initiates a framework within which subsequent projects \ncould address generic management and conservation  concerns,  propagate  community-based \nnatural  resource  management,  promote  sustainable livelihoods,  pioneer  stewardship  of  core \n\n                                                 \n46 Prek Toal is probably the most significant water bird nesting ground in Southeast Asia. \n47 The Project will replicate the floating environmental center (Greater Environment Chong Khneas Office [GECKO]) \nfunded under FAO's project for Participatory Natural Resources Management in the Tonle Sap Region. GECKO is \nmoored  at  Chong  Khneas  and  moves  around  as  necessary.  It  is  used  to:  (i)  extend  environmental  education  to \ncommunities,  particularly  schoolchildren;  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  schoolteachers  in  environmental  education;  (iii) \nmake  tourists  more  aware  of  the  environment;  and  (iv)  generate  educational  and  publicity  materials  for  free \ndissemination and sale. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\nareas by communities, upgrade basinwide research and database development, or encourage \nextension  services  in  place  of  regulation.  Infrastructure  for  waste  management,  water  supply \nand  sanitation,  multipurpose  landing  sites,  ecotourism,  and  expanded  rural  credit  and \nmicrofinance may also be appropriate. \n \n36. \nCofinancing.  The  Project  will  leverage  grant  funding  from  the  Global  Environment \nFacility  (GEF)  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP\u2019s)  Capacity  21 \nprogram  to  promote  complementarity  of  operations  and  sharing  of  experience  (Appendix  8). \nGEF aims to meet the incremental cost of achieving global benefits, or the cost of an alternative \nproject to that which a country would have undertaken in its own interest. Its contribution to the \nProject  will  build  management  capacity  for  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  TSBR.48  UNDP's \nCapacity 21 program aims to build capacity for sustainable development. Its contribution to the \nProject  will  strengthen  the  ability  of  staff  of  CFDO  and  provincial  line  agencies  to  engage \ncommunities in natural resource management. \n \n37. \nSocial  Participation.  The  Project  will  promote  community  organization  for  natural \nresource  management.  Using  a  process  approach, trained provincial staff of the DAFF; DOE; \nand  contracted  NGOs  will  select  communities  willing  to  participate  in  project  activities.  The \ncommunities  will  be  trained  in  group  activities.  The  poorer  sections  of  the  communities  and \nwomen, particularly those who head households, will be encouraged to take part. \n \n38. \nSpecific  Targeting  of  Beneficiaries.  The  Project  will  provide  full  opportunities  for \nwomen,  especially  those  who  head  households,  to  participate  in  community  organization, \nrepresentation, training, training of trainers, and decision-making. The target is to allocate 40% \nof seats in community organizations to women depending on specific local situations and needs. \nSubgroups  of  women  will  be  organized  at  village  level  for  training  and  capacity  building  for \nparticipation and leadership. \n \nSurveys on Livelihood Attributes. Community information collected in the process of \n39. \nprioritizing  targets  will  serve  for  project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  information  will  define \nthe  communities  in  terms  of  natural  resource  base,  social  stratification,  poverty,  livelihood \nsystems,  conflict,  agricultural  production,  food  insecurity,  indebtedness,  organization,  gender \nissues, and access to economic resources. After 2 years, an external research institute will be \ncontracted  to  carry  out  an  evaluation.  Using  participatory  techniques  and  the  baseline \ninformation, the institute will assess progress in community organization. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n40. \nThe  total  project  cost,  including  contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated at $19.4 \nmillion equivalent, consisting of foreign exchange of $8.8 million (about 45%) and local currency \nof $10.6 million equivalent (about 55%). GEF will cofinance the Project in the amount of about \n$3.9  million  through  a  grant  to  be  implemented  by  UNDP.  In  addition,  UNDP's  Capacity  21 \nprogram will provide about $623,000 as grant.49 The Government will finance about $3.9 million \nequivalent in local currency (Appendix 9). \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n48 The  World  Conservation  Society  wishes  to  cofinance,  in  the  amount  of  $200,000,  project  activities  to  develop \n\nsystems for monitoring and management. \n\n49 Cofinancing by UNDP is contingent on approval of the loan by ADB and cofinancing by GEF. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n13\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n1.

A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  chaired  by  the  minister  of \nMAFF  has  been  established  to  advise  on  project  implementation,  provide  a  mechanism  for \nresolving  implementation  problems  that  go  beyond  single  ministerial  mandates,  and  review \nprogress. The members of the PSC are the minister of MAFF, the minister of MOE, the minister \nof the  Ministry of Economy and Finance, the chairman of CNMC, and the governors of the five \nproject  provinces,  or  their  representatives.  Meetings  will  take  place  every  6  months  and,  if \npossible, concurrent with CNMC board meetings. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n43.  MAFF will be the Executing Agency for the Project (Appendix 10). It will implement the \nbulk of project activities that relate to strengthening natural resource management coordination \nand planning for the TSBR and organizing communities for natural resource management in the \nTSBR.  In  recent  years,  it  has  developed  technical  and  project  management  skills  through \npractical  experience  in  projects  assisted  by  ADB  and  other  entities.  MAFF  also  has  an \nestablished  network  of  representation  in  the  five  project  provinces  bordering  the  Tonle  Sap. \nMOE  will  implement  the  activities  that  relate  to  building  management  capacity  for  biodiversity \nconservation  in  the  TSBR.  CNMC  will  assume  an  important  monitoring  and  coordinating \nfunction  and  will  be  responsible  for  formulating  common  policy  objectives  for  managing  the \nTSBR through the TSBR Secretariat. The UNDP Country Office in Phnom Penh will implement \nthe GEF and Capacity 21 grants under the national execution modality. \n \nA  project  monitoring  and  coordination  office  (PMCO)  has  been  established  to  assume \n44. \nresponsibility for integrating operations. The PMCO is located in the TSBR Secretariat, and the \npermanent  deputy  (environment)  of  the  secretariat  has  been  appointed as project coordinator. \nAn international project management advisor, a domestic finance and administration consultant, \nand full-time administrative, financial, and secretarial staff will assist the project coordinator. The \nPMCO will be responsible for project coordination, including consolidating financial statements, \nharmonizing  equipment  specifications  and  procurement  procedures,  scheduling  project \nactivities,  and  general  administration.  The  three  divisions  of  the  TSBR  Secretariat  will  provide \nthe  PMCO  with  day-to-day  technical  support.  During  the  first  year  of  the  Project,  the  Policy, \nStrategy,  and  Networking  Division  within  the  TSBR  Secretariat  will  be  strengthened  to \ncoordinate  legal  and  policy  issues  pertaining  to  the  TSBR.  It  will  coordinate  activities with the \nlegal drafting groups in central line agencies. \n \n45. \nProject  implementation  offices  (PIOs)  have  been  set  up  in  DOF,  the  Department  of \nNature Conservation and Protection within MOE, and the TSBR Secretariat. Senior members of \nstaff  of  these  institutions  have  been  appointed  as  PIO  head  and  will  be  supported  by  full-time \nadministrative,  financial,  and  secretarial  staff  to  supervise  and  manage  direct  implementation \nactivities under the Project. As such, PIOs will be responsible for planning and budgeting project \nactivities  and,  as  required,  supervising  and  monitoring  provincial-level  field  activities  through \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs).  In  the  PIO  in  DOF,  a  fisheries  management  adviser  will \nassume responsibility for supervising  project activities in DOF and its PIUs and elaborating the \nterms  of  reference  for  the  service  provider  for  component  2.  Within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  PIUs  will  be  set  up  in  each  of  the  five  project  provinces  in  the  Office  of \nFisheries in DAFF, and in DOE. Senior members of staff of these institutions will be seconded \non a full-time basis as PIU head and will be supported by full-time administrative, financial, and \nsecretarial staff to implement activities in the provinces. \n \n46. \nimplemented  over  5  years.  For \ncomponent 1,  activities  will  concentrate  in  the  first  year  on:  (i)  strengthening  the  TSBR \nSecretariat's structures and facilities; (ii) formulating common policy objectives for managing the \nTSBR;  and  (iii)  improving  the  regulatory  and  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries.  The \nfocus  in  the  second  year  will  be  on:  (i)  developing  the  TSBR-ED;  (ii)  formulating  and \nimplementing  a  national  environmental  education  and  awareness  campaign;  (iii)  preparing \northophotomaps;  (iv)  delineating  biosphere  zonation  and  boundaries;  (v)  refining  and  adopting \nthe  common  policy  objectives \nformulated;  (vi)  setting  standards  and  guidelines\u2014for \ndissemination  by  DOF\u2014for  formulating  community  and  commercial  fisheries  management \nplans; and (vii) building the capacity of CFDO. \n \n\nImplementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n15\n\nresource  management;  and \n\nFor component 2, activities in the first year will center on reviewing previous approaches \n47. \nto  organizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management  and  refining  the  preferred \napproach.  They  will  build  up  from  the  second  year  by:  (i)  strengthening  provincial  office \nstructures and facilities; (ii) implementing a training program for staff of provincial line agencies; \n(iii)  activating  commune  councils  and  appropriate  village-level  structures  for  natural  resource \nmanagement; (iv) mobilizing NGOs to support community-based natural resource management \nand  monitor  progress;  (v)  surveying  previous  and  ongoing  approaches  to  the  development  of \ntechnical  packages  based  on  sustainable  natural \n(vi) \nrecommending selected technical packages for sustainable natural resource management that \ncan  be  replicated  or  further  developed.  The  third  year  activities  will  revolve  around:  (i) \norganizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management;  (ii)  reviewing  boundaries  and \ndescribing community resource rights; and (iii) encouraging the formulation of natural resource \nmanagement plans at the local level. \n \n48. \nFor  component  3,  activities  in  the  first  year  will  entail  identifying indicator species and \ndesigning  a  biodiversity  monitoring  system.  Project  activities  during  the  second  year  will \ncomprise:  (i)  establishing  and  equipping  protected  area  management  units  and  core  area \nmanagement  centers;  (ii)  instituting  a  process  for  identifying  additional  core  areas  and  fish \nsanctuaries;  (iii)  conducting  a  training  needs  analysis  for  protected  area  management  and \nbiodiversity conservation; (iv) implementing a biodiversity monitoring system; (v) establishing a \nrapid-response mechanism for seasonal protection of biodiversity; (vi) developing a strategy and \ncarrying  out  an  awareness  campaign  for  the  control  of  exotic  species  and  conducting \nmanagement trials; (vii) developing a strategy to enforce laws and regulations in and around the \ncore  areas  and  other  important  sites;  (viii)  identifying  income-generating  activities  that  directly \nthreaten  biodiversity  in  the  core  areas  and  developing  alternative  livelihoods  to  modify  those \nactivities;  (ix)  developing  and  implementing  an  EAEOP  for  the  TSBR;  and  (x)  establishing \nfloating  environmental  education  centers.  In  the  third  year,  activities  will  focus  on:  (i) \nimplementing  the  staff  training  program  for  protected  area  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation;  (ii)  implementing  the  strategy  to  enforce  laws  and  regulations  in  and  around  the \ncore  areas  and  other  important  sites;  and  (iii)  incorporating  the  EAEOP  into  selected  schools \naround the TSBR (Appendix 11). \n \nProcurement. Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the loan \n49. \nproceeds  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles, \nequipment, and material will be procured by international competitive bidding where the cost is \nmore than $500,000, or by international shopping where the cost  is from $100,000 to $500,000. \nVehicles,  equipment,  and  material  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  equivalent  may  be  procured \nunder  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  (LCB).  Minor  items  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$50,000 may be purchased directly. The civil works to be financed from the proceeds of the loan \nare small, scattered, and unlikely to attract international bidders. They may be procured under \nLCB procedures (Appendix 12). \n \n50. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  require  271  person-months  of international and \n1,402  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services,  mainly  in  fisheries,  natural  resource \ncommunity \nmanagement,  environmental  protection,  environmental  education,  and \norganization.50  The  consultants  financed  under  the  loan  will  be  engaged  through  a  consulting \nfirm  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Procurement  will  be  based  on \n\n                                                 \n50 About 171 person-months of international and 1,032 person-months of domestic consulting services will be loan-\n\nfinanced. \n\n \n\n\f16\n\ncompetitive  procedures,  but  where  the  number  of  service  providers is limited, direct selection \nwill  be  applied  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB.  Where  direct  selection  does  not  apply, \nconsultants will be recruited using ADB's quality and cost-based selection method. The Project \nwill also contract out services to prequalified international and local NGOs and other institutions. \nThe  consultants  financed  by  the  cofinanciers  will  be  recruited  in  consultation  with  ADB \n(Appendix 13). \n \n51. \nAdvance  Action.  On  30  April  2002,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  recruiting \nconsultants and procuring goods and related services, and civil works. The advance actions are \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  ADB's  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that  approval  of  advance  action  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n52. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  The  Project  will  comply  with  ADB's  anticorruption  policy, \nparticularly  in  respect  of  the  sections  of  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of  Consultants that relate to fraud and corruption. External auditors will \naudit the project accounts annually and the Executing Agency will ensure the timely submission \nof audited accounts. \n \n53. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  All  agencies  involved  in  implementation  will \nmaintain  separate  accounts  for  project-related disbursements. The PMCO will consolidate the \naccounts  from  all  sources  to  MAFF,  which  will  then  review  and  submit  them  to  the  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Finance  and  ADB.  All  project  accounts  will  be  audited  independently  annually. \nThe audit report will include, among others, a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB \nagainst  the  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  have  been  used  as  claimed.  Project  accounts, \ntogether with disbursement documentation, will be audited annually with all reports forwarded to \nADB and the Government within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The Government will \nopen an imprest account at the National Bank of Cambodia or any commercial bank designated \nby the Government. Second-generation imprest accounts will be opened in the name of CNMC, \nMAFF,  and  MOE,  which  will  take  direct  responsibility  for  all  administrative  and  accounting \nrequirements relating to the operation and use of such funds. The initial advance for the imprest \naccount  will  be  the  estimated  expenditures  for  6  months,  with  a  ceiling  of  $1  million.  SOE \nprocedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  with  a  total  contract  value  not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  and  to  liquidate  advances  covered  in  the  imprest \naccounts.  The  imprest  accounts  and  SOE  procedures  will  be  established,  operated,  and \nmaintained in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Both will \nbe  audited  as  part  of  the  regular  audit  of  the  project's account, with financial statements and \naudit opinion set out separately within 9 months from the end of the fiscal year. \n \n54. \nProject Monitoring and Evaluation. Project performance and achievement of benefits \nwill  be  monitored  based  on  the  project  framework.  However,  given  the  process  nature  of  the \nProject,  it  is  anticipated  that  the  framework  could  evolve  during  implementation  and  entail \nmodification of outputs and activities. The PIUs will provide the PIOs with standardized quarterly \nreports  during  each  year  of  implementation,  detailing  the  physical  and  financial  progress  of \nactivities  against  targets  and  summarizing  monitoring  and  evaluation  results.  In  turn,  the  PIOs \nwill submit to the PMCO consolidated quarterly progress reports. The PMCO will submit to the \nGovernment  and  ADB  6-monthly  progress  reports  that  pay  close  attention  to  output \naccomplishment and improvement of activities. \n \n55. \nsemiannual  reviews. \n\nProject Review.  During  the  first  3  years  of  project  implementation,  ADB  will  carry  out \nthe  Government  will  undertake  a \n\nthird  year,  ADB  and \n\nthe \n\nIn \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\ncomprehensive  midterm  review.  GEF  and  UNDP  grant  reporting  will  comply  with  GEF  and \nUNDP requirements, respectively. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, the \nPMCO will make publicly available a project completion report in the standard ADB format. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n56. \nA TA will be provided to improve the regulatory and management framework for inland \nfisheries,  giving  early  attention  to  the  subdecree on community fisheries. The total cost of the \nTA  is  estimated  at  $634,000,  comprising  foreign  exchange  of  $396,000  and  local  currency  of \n$238,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $540,000  equivalent, \nincluding the entire foreign exchange cost and $144,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $94,000,  largely  through  the \nprovision  of  office  accommodation  and  remuneration  and  per  diem  of  counterpart  staff,  as  set \nout  in  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  for  the  TA.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  12 \nmonths. The Executing Agency will be DOF. FAO will be selected directly to deliver the services \nrequired (Appendix 14). \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEnvironmental \n\n57. \nBy  engaging  many  national  actors,  the  Project  will  activate  Cambodia's  principal  policy \ninstruments for natural resource management. It will also help Cambodia to meet the obligations \nthat  are  embodied  in  more  than  10  treaties  and  conventions,  and  work  toward  the  goals  of \nUNESCO's Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves, 1995.51 \n \nB. \n\nPolicy \n\n58. \nThe  reform  of  inland  fisheries  is  placing  a  considerable  burden on DOF. It is urgent to \nprovide  a  legal  basis  for  sound  management  of  fisheries  resources,  establish  a  policy  and \ntechnical framework that incorporates principles of ecosystem-wide management, and define a \nshared  interministerial  vision  for  managing  the  TSBR.  The  Project  will  improve  the  regulatory \nand  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries.  It  will  also  create  capacity  in  the  TSBR \nSecretariat to address legal and policy issues, and advance through CNMC the formulation of \ncommon policy objectives for managing the TSBR. \n \nC. \n\nInstitutional \n\n59. \nSustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity \ndepends on having adequate capacity at all levels. At the national level, the Project will enhance \nmanagement  systems  and  develop  the  capability  to  coordinate  and  plan  for  natural  resource \nmanagement. At the provincial and district levels, it will nurture the capability of Government line \nagencies and NGOs to assist the communities in managing natural resources. At the local level, \nthe  Project  will  organize  and  promote  community  participation  in  managing  natural  resources \nand develop Government line agencies\u2019 capability for biodiversity conservation. \n \n                                                 \n51 The goals of the Seville Strategy for  Biosphere Reserves are to: (i) use biosphere reserves to conserve natural and \ncultural  diversity;  (ii)  use  biosphere  reserves  as  models  of  land  management  and  of  approaches  to  sustainable \ndevelopment; (iii) use biosphere reserves for research, monitoring,  education, and training; and (iv) implement the \nbiosphere reserve concept. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\nD. \n\nSocial \n\n60. \nCommunity  Organization.  Cambodia  has  suffered  social  dislocation  and  working \ncooperatively is not easy. The Project will promote the cohesion of communities and raise their \neconomic efficiency and ability to capture investment. In relation to governance, the Project will \nstimulate the decentralization achieved by the first commune-level elections of February 2002, \nwhich aimed to build democracy from the grassroots. \n \nPoverty  Reduction.  The  Project  will  strengthen  the  self-reliance  of  the  poor  and \n61. \nvulnerable  groups  in  communities  by  giving  them  a  voice  in  determining  future  community \ndevelopment  and  activities  in  managing  natural  resources;  encouraging  them  to  participate  in \nmapping  and  delineating  of  boundaries;  enhancing  their  capacity  to  organize  and  manage \nnatural  resources;  and  conducting  surveys  and  making  recommendations  for  technical \npackages promoting viable, diversified, or alternative livelihoods.  Female heads of households \nand widows will be encouraged to take part in training and group-based activities (Appendix 15). \n \nEthnic  Minorities. The Project will give ethnic minorities opportunities to participate in \n62. \ncommunity  organization.  It  will  attempt\u2014through  commune  councils,  commune  chiefs, \nGovernment  staff  trained  in  participatory  approaches,  and  NGOs\u2014to  build  relations  of  trust \nbetween  the  Khmers  and  the  Vietnamese  minority.52  The  impact  of  participation  on  minorities \nwill be monitored. The TA will examine the rights of Vietnamese communities. \n \nE. \n\nEconomic \n\nInland  fisheries  contribute  5\u201310%  of  Cambodia's  gross  domestic  product:  a decline in \n63. \ntheir volume or value would have immediate drastic effects on Cambodia's economy. Aside from \nthe  significance  of  the  lake  in  the  economy,  impairment  of  its  fisheries  would  deprive  poor \npeople of their main source of protein and undermine their  fragile food and health security.53 In \nshort,  the  replacement  cost  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  fisheries  would  be  unaffordable.54 Economic \nbenefits  from  the  Project  need  to  be  seen  in  this  light.  Other  economic  benefits  that  are  not \neasily  measured  arise  from  the  Project's  capacity-building  activities,  which  will  continue  to  be \navailable  for  development  activities  in  the  future.  At  the  global  level,  loss  of  the  lake's \nbiodiversity would have irreparable consequences for future generations. \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\nRegulatory  Framework.  Insufficient  review  of  and  delay  in  preparing,  completing,  or \n64. \namending  the  Fisheries  Law  and  the  subdecrees,  proclamations,  and  directives  or  circulars \nassociated with it are risks. The TA will mitigate them. \n \nCoverage.  The  Project  will  refine  a  preferred  approach  to  community  organization  and \n65. \napply it in the five project provinces. Rapid expansion is a risk that the Project addresses in two \n\n                                                 \n52 Cooperation between the Khmers and the Cham minority is not problematic. \n53 The Tonle Sap's importance in respect of food security is certain to increase, given the growth pressure of a large \n\nunder-15-year-old population (nearing 50%). \n\n54 Policy makers often undervalue inland fisheries. A realistic method of approximating nonmarketed benefits from the \nTonle Sap would be to calculate the cost of an alternative for its original products or services, if it can be found. For \ninstance, given the importance of fish in the Cambodian diet, the cost of replacing this source of food should the \nTonle  Sap\u2019s  fisheries  suddenly  collapse  would  be  at  least  that  of  providing  in  equal  quantities  40\u201370%  of  the \nprotein intake of the country's population. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n19\n\nways:  it  will  avail  of  the  local  expertise  built  up  by  FAO,  and  it  will  consider,  in  the  phasing of \ncommunity organization, the willingness to participate. \n \n66. \nSectoral  Interests.  Sectoral  interests  may  hamper  interministerial  cooperation  for \nnatural  resource  management.  For  this  reason,  establishment  of  the  TSBR  Secretariat  as \ncoordinating body, with a direct reporting line to CNMC, gives ground for optimism. The Project \nwill strengthen the TSBR Secretariat to further temper sectoral interests. \n \nCommunity  Self-Regulation.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  community  self-regulation \n67. \nas  a  viable  alternative  to  command  and  control,  bearing  in  mind  that  change  cannot  happen \novernight. Participation will arise out of a system that is fair and is seen to be so. To this intent, \nthe Project will make clear the benefits of community-based management of natural resources. \n \n68.  Mekong  River.  Dam  construction  on  the  Mekong  River  and  its  tributaries  would  affect \nfish  migration  and  breeding  patterns  but  also  the  level  of  flooding  in  the  Tonle  Sap.  Concerns \nhave also been raised over plans to clear rapids and widen a shipping lane in the Mekong River \nto enable cargo boats to navigate between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand \nin the dry season.  A  permanent  lowering  of  flood  levels  in  the  lake  or  an  alteration  in  floods \nwould  reduce  the  Project\u2019s  benefits.55  This warrants  international  support  to  the  Mekong  River \nCommission's basin development plan and water utilization program. \n \n69. \nEnvironmental  Impact.  The  Project  is  classified  under  environment  category  B.  An \ninitial  environmental  examination  undertaken  during  project  preparation  concluded  that  the \nProject would have no negative impacts on the environment. \n \n70. \nAvailability of Human Resources. The availability and capacity of line agency staff for \nsocial networking may pose a limitation. To counter this risk, the Project will effect substantial \nstaff  training  in  the  first  12\u201318  months  of  implementation.  It  will  also  contract  international \norganizations and NGOs with experience in Cambodia.56 \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \n\n71. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCounterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation on time. The Government will make timely submissions of annual \nbudgetary  appropriation \nrequests  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of project implementation. \nProject framework. The Government and the Executing Agency will ensure that \nthey implement the Project in accordance with the project framework, as set out \nin Appendix 1 of this report, and within the time frame stipulated therein. \nRegulatory framework. The Government will ensure that it prepares or amends \nthe  Fisheries  Law,  including  the  subdecrees,  proclamations,  and  directives  or \ncirculars associated with the Fisheries Law, on time, in the form and substance \ndeveloped  by  the  TA.  Within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  draft \namendment  to  the  Fisheries  Law  developed  pursuant  to  the  TA  will  have  been \n\n                                                 \n55 Data from 1940\u20132000 shows a clear correlation between water levels at peak flood and fish catch. \n56 One hundred local and 200 international NGOs are in Cambodia. Many carry out environment-related activities. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \nB. \n\n72. \n\n \n\nsubmitted  to  the  legislator.  The  Government  will  further  ensure  that  within  6 \nmonths  of  the  promulgation  of  the  amended  Fisheries  Law,  the  implementing \nregulations or subdecrees to the amended Fisheries Law will have been issued. \n\n(iv)  Mapping.  The  Government  and  the  Executing  Agency  will  make  available  to \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ninterested parties all mapping and database products. \nGender. The Government will ensure that the Project provides full opportunities \nfor women, particularly female heads of households, to participate in community \norganization,  representation,  and  decision  making.  About  40%  of  seats  in \ncommunity  organizations  will  be  allocated  to  women.  Women  will  be  organized \nfor  training  and  capacity  building  for  participation  and  leadership.  They  will  be \nselected  for  training  in  livelihood  development,  value-added  activities,  and \nestablishing linkages with ongoing microfinance programs. \nEthnic  minorities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  benefits ethnic \nminorities by providing them opportunities to participate in training in community \norganization.  The  Project's  impact  on  ethnic  minorities  will  be  observed  during \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n\n(vii)  Project  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  Government  will  ensure \n\nthat \ncommunity data collected in the process of prioritizing targets serves as baseline \ninformation for project monitoring and evaluation. \n\n(viii)  External  auditors,  annual  auditing,  and  financial  statements.  External \nauditors will be engaged to audit project accounts. The annual audited accounts \nand financial statements, together with audit reports, in English, will be submitted \nto ADB within 9 months following the end of the Government's fiscal year. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nPrior to loan effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n(i) \n\nTSBR Secretariat.

In \nJuly 2001, the implementation consultant submitted a draft feasibility study. In November 2001, \nADB engaged individual consultants to reinforce the study with supplementary analyses. \n \n2. \nAn ADB mission visited Cambodia from 22 October to 5 November 2001. After reviewing \nthe  problems  facing  the  Tonle  Sap,  the  Mission  concluded  that  sustainable  management  and \nconservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  should  be  considered  from  the  basin's \nperspective.  In  keeping  with  this  outlook,  the  Mission  recommended  that  a  first  project  build \nmanagement  systems  and  capacity  and  that  provision  be  made  for  investment  projects  once \nthis has been achieved. For the Project, the Mission identified components and costs, executing \nand  implementing  agencies,  and  cofinanciers.  It  spelled  out  the  requirements  for  aid \ncoordination  and  finalized  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  supplementary  project  formulation \nactivities required. From 5 November to 14 December 2001, the individual consultants engaged \nby  ADB  described  the  Project  envisaged,  focusing  on  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve. \nThereafter,  on  17\u201318  December  2001,  an  ADB  Mission  visited  Cambodia  to  take  stock  of  the \nfindings. \n \n3. \nThe  ADB  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Cambodia  from  25  February  to  15  March \n2002  to  (i)  update  available  information  on  all  aspects  of  the  proposed  Project  (including \ntechnical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, and policy matters); (ii) \nconsult with a cross-section of prospective beneficiaries and nongovernment organizations; (iii) \ndevote  attention  to  institutional  capacities,  project  costs,  and  financing  arrangements;  (iv) \nsecure the active involvement of the Government, as well as adequate and timely counterpart \nfunds  for  the  Project;  and  (v)  clarify  prospects  for  commitments  to  the  Project  from  other \nsources . It examined the Project in the context of the Government's development objectives and \nADB's operational strategy for Cambodia, and refined the Project's design. \n \nThe  ADB  Loan  Appraisal  Mission  visited  Cambodia  from  13  May  to  5  June  2002  to \n4. \ncomplete  the  review  and  analysis  of  the  loan  proposal  and  the  sector  to  which  it  relates, \nincluding the  technical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, and other \naspects of the Project.2 \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

In  support  of  the  technical  assistance,  ADB  agreed  that  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)  execute  GEF  PDF-B  grant  technical  assistance,  for  $350,000,  to  prepare  a  biodiversity \nconservation project in the Tonle Sap. UNDP would then take the lead in executing a Global Environment Facility \n(GEF)  grant  paralleling  an  ADB  project.  During  project  formulation,  UNDP  determined  that  Capacity  21  funding \ncould  also  be  sought  to  build  the  capacity  for  sustainable  development  through  participatory  and  institutional \nstrengthening approaches. \n\n2  The Mission was joined by D. Greboval, Senior Fishery Planning Officer, Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited  Nations  (FAO);  B.  Koemlangan,  Legal  Officer;  FAO;  P.

It  supports  a \nhuge  population  through  its  enormous  fisheries  productivity  and  water  supply  and  provides  the \nlast  refuge  for  some  of  Asia\u2019s  most  globally  significant  biodiversity.a However, human population \nand  development  pressures  are  increasing.  In  response,  the  Government  established  the  Tonle \nSap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) in February 2001 as a focal point of environmental management. \nNot  surprisingly,  the  establishment  of  the  TSBR  has  shed  light  on  the  numerous  threats  to  the \nTonle  Sap,  the  most  immediate  of  which  defined  the  core  problems  to  be  addressed  by  the \nProject. \nHowever, each threat to the Tonle Sap has multiple root causes, the severity of which conditions \nthe  speed  and  manner  in  which  they  can  be  addressed.  In  recognition  of  the  complexity  of  the \nagents of change, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognized that sustainable  management \nand conservation of natural resources and biodiversity should be considered from the perspective \nof the basin feeding the Tonle Sap. In keeping with this outlook, the Project initiates  a  framework \nwithin  which  subsequent  projects  could  address  generic  management  and  conservation \nconcerns,  propagate  community-based  natural  resource  management,  promote  sustainable \nlivelihoods, pioneer stewardship of core areas by communities, upgrade basinwide research and \ndatabase  development,  or  encourage  extension  services  in  place  of  regulation.  Infrastructure  for \nwaste  management,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  multipurpose  landing  sites,  ecotourism,  and \nexpanded rural credit and microfinance may also be appropriate. \nADB's  Country  Strategy  and  Program,  2003\u20132005  for  Cambodia  reflects  ADB's  sectorwide \napproach  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  ADB  expects  to  pursue  this  approach  over  a  10-year horizon. \nUnder the program, the Project (2002) will enhance systems and develop the capacity for natural \nresource  management  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural \nresource \nmanagement, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. Two other loans are also planned: \n(a) \n\nChong  Kneas  Environmental  Improvement  (2004).  This  project  will  complement  and \nbuild  on  the  enhanced  systems  for  natural  resource  management  coordination  and \nplanning  that  are  to  be  developed  under  the  Project.  Its  objective  will  be  to  improve  the \nsocial and natural environment at Chong Kneas by upgrading existing infrastructure (boat \nlanding and related facilities), providing communal services (water supply, sanitation, and \nwaste  collection  and  disposal),  and  eliminating  threats  to  the  environment  resulting  from \nthe  chaotic  exercise  of  competing  claims  by  residents,  fisher  folk,  tourists,  vendors,  and \nboat  operators  to  access  via  the  currently  inadequate  port  facilities.  The  project  will \nimprove  living  conditions  for  residents  of  Chong  Kneas,  remove  health  hazards,  and \nprovide increased opportunities for employment and development of new livelihoods and \nsmall enterprises. \nTonle  Sap  Sustainable  Livelihoods  Sector  (2005).  This  project  will  complement  and \nbuild on the enhanced community capacity for natural resource management that is to be \ndeveloped  under  the  Project. Its objective will be to reduce poverty in poor communities \nwithin  the  flooded  area  of  the  Tonle  Sap,  through  decentralized  and  participatory \nactivities  to  support  rural  development.  The  project  will  support  community  mobilization \nfor  formulation  of  development  plans  and  implementation  of  small-scale infrastructure to \nenhance  rural  incomes  and  thereby  relieve  pressures  on  the  natural  resources  of  the \nTonle  Sap  basin.  In  a  complementary  manner,  the  project  will  also  provide  alternative \nlivelihood  activities and further develop the capacity for natural resource management. It \nwill adopt a process approach that strengthens the community\u2019s sense of ownership and \ncapacity through participatory planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \n\n(b) \n\n(iv) \n\nADB  will  augment  its  support  for  sustainable  management and conservation by leveraging grant \nresources  to  enable  improvements  in  the  livelihoods  of  the  poorest,  for  instance,  through  better \naccess  to  basic  and  facilitating  infrastructure  as  well  as  improved  access  to  information, \ntechnologies, and training. \n\n \na  Much of this biodiversity came to light only recently, following decades of insecurity and isolation in Cambodia. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nTHE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE TONLE SAP  \n\nFlora \n\n \n1. \nThe Tonle Sap covers an area of 250,000\u2013300,000 hectares (ha) in the dry season and \nis the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Its immense wetlands are the result of a unique \nhydrological phenomenon. When the level of the Mekong River rises, water flows up the Tonle \nSap River and spreads over the Tonle Sap floodplain, inundating 1.0\u20131.6 million ha. In the face \nof  the  loss  of  wetland  habitat,  the  Tonle  Sap  floodplain's  size  (by  far  the  greatest  continuous \narea  of  savannah  swamp  forest  and  inundated  forest  in  the  entire  Asian  region),  habitat \ndiversity,  and  relative  preservation  are  of  exceptional  importance.  (Other  wetland  areas  of \nCambodia and Southern Viet Nam are widely disturbed.) Almost 200 plant species have been \nrecorded in the Tonle Sap region. This huge wetland system with its habitat diversity supports \none  of  the  world\u2019s  most  productive  freshwater  fisheries.  The  ecosystem  is  essential  to  the \nsurvival of the many globally significant species of birds, mammals, and reptiles found around \nthe lake during migration. The Tonle Sap and its floodplain are also important as a river system. \nThey  regulate  the  discharge  of  the  Mekong  River  and  prevent  flooding  and  saltwater  intrusion \ninto the Mekong Delta. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  flooded  forest  of  the  Tonle  Sap  is  the  largest  remaining  example  of  this  type  of \nhabitat  in  Southeast  Asia.  Despite  the  common  name,  this  flooded  forest  is  in  fact  a  diverse \nunity of habitats, including shrub lands, stunted swamp forests, gallery forests, and submerged \nand floating aquatic vegetation. About 200 plant species have been recorded and the flora as a \nwhole is distinct from that of other wetlands associated with the Mekong River, especially with \nregard  to  woody  species.  Some  restricted-range  tree  species  (Homalium  brevidens  and \nTerminalia  cambodiana)  are  endemic  to  the  Tonle  Sap  and  the  southern  coastal  zone  of \nCambodia  and  have  suffered  from  exploitation  for  charcoal  production.  The  flora  of  the  Tonle \nSap  and  its  specific  adaptations  to  withstand  months  of  flooding  are  insufficiently  studied  and \nunderstood. \n \nB. \n \nThe  fisheries  of  the  Tonle  Sap  and  the  Tonle  Sap  River  account  for  15\u201320%  of \n3. \nfreshwater capture fisheries in the lower Mekong Basin and represent 50\u201370% of the catch for \nCambodia. The fisheries productivity of the lake is known to be one of the highest in the world: \nnearly  10  times  more  productive  than  the  North  Atlantic  sea  fisheries  per  hectare.  This \nproductivity  is  generally  attributed  to  the  flooded  forest.  A  total  of  107  fish  species  has  been \nrecorded  for  the  lake  only;  the  number  of  fish  species  occurring  in  the  Tonle  Sap  River  is \nprobably higher, and new species are regularly discovered and described. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nInvertebrates are an important component of the Tonle Sap's ecosystem. The available \ntaxonomic  information  is  incomplete  but  studies  so  far  have  identified  46  species  of \nzooplankton. The rich biodiversity of mollusks in the Tonle Sap has been described as striking \nand 57 species of benthic invertebrates have been identified. Boeung Tonle Chhmar, the Stung \nSen  River,  and  Sangke  River  estuaries  are  areas  with  high  concentrations  of  bivalves.  Three \nspecies of bivalves (Cobicula bocourti, C. cyreniformes, C. moreletiana), two species of prawns \n(Macrobrachium  rosenbergii,  M.  lanchesteri)  and  one  species  of  crab  (Somanniathelpusa  sp.) \nhave been confirmed for the Tonle Sap. These freshwater invertebrates are an important source \nof food for people and aquatic wildlife. \n\nInvertebrates \n\nFish \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nBirds \n\nMammals \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \nSome  46  mammal  species  are  likely  to  occur  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  Some  large \nspecies such as the Asiatic elephant and tiger used to migrate from upland areas to the Tonle \nSap  through  natural  corridors.  An  agricultural  belt  cutting  off  the  floodplain  from  upland  forest \nareas now surrounds the floodplain. This isolation has resulted in a decrease in the number of \nmammal species occurring in the Tonle Sap. The current status of the mammal species directly \ndependent on the Tonle Sap is poorly documented, but number at least 15 species. \n \nE. \n \nThe  Tonle  Sap  (mainly  at  Prek  Toal,  but  also  at  Boeng  Tonle  Chhmar)  sustains  the \n6. \nlargest colonies of water birds in Indochina, and perhaps in Southeast Asia. Its floodplain is an \nimportant  breeding  area  for  ducks,  jacanas,  bustards,  rails,  herons  and  egrets,  cormorants, \ndarters,  ibises,  pelicans,  and  storks.  Some  225  species  of  birds  have  been  recorded  in  the \nTonle Sap region since the 1960s. \n \nF. \n \nThe occurrence and distribution of amphibians and reptiles in Cambodia are not known \n7. \nwell and herpetologists still rely on historical literature. There are probably 42 species of reptiles \n(including 1 species of endemic water snake, 7 species of turtles or tortoises, and 1 species of \ncrocodile). \n \nG. \n \n8. \nRapid  human  population  growth  and  associated  development  pressures,  and  demand \nfor natural resources are affecting biodiversity (Table A2.1). Many species found in Cambodian \nwetlands  are  on  the  International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature  and  Natural  Resources \n(IUCN)  Red  List,  and  12  species  are  listed  under  the  Convention  on  International  Trade  in \nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, 1979. \n\nReptiles and Amphibians \n\nThreatened Species \n\nTable A4.1: Threatened Species Found in Cambodian Wetlands \n\nTaxonomic \nGroup \n\nCritically \nEndangered \n\nEndangered \n\nVulnerable \n\nLower Risk \n\nTotal \n\nData \nDeficient \n\nBirds  \nDolphins and \nPorpoises  \nTurtles and \nTerrapins  \n\nOther \n\nMammals  \n\nFish \nCrocodiles \n\nand Snakes  \nTotal \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n2 \n0 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n1 \n\n7 \n\n5 \n0 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n6 \n0 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n7 \n0 \n\n6 \n\n3 \n\n0 \n1 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n9 \n0 \n\n1 \n\n4 \n\n1 \n0 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n13 \n\n17 \n\n15 \n\nNote: Categories refer to the IUCN threat category. \nSource: 2000 IUCN Red List. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n23 \n2 \n\n11 \n\n8 \n\n11 \n2 \n\n57 \n\n0 \n2 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n0 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n33 \n\nThe Core Areas \n\nH. \n \n9. \nThe three core areas within the Tonle Sap floodplain were identified on the basis of their \nexceptional  conservation  value  (Table  A2.2).

Boeng  Tonle  Chhmar  boasts  the  highest  habitat  diversity  on  the  floodplain, \nconsisting  of  a  system  of  creeks,  waterways,  a  permanent  lake  within  the  floodplain,  and \nnumerous isolated permanent pools.

However, \nno  information  exchange  and  management  system  serves  its  needs.  Much  data  on  the  Tonle \nSap exists and new data is being collected continuously. However, this data is scattered among \ninstitutions,  projects,  and  individuals  and  is  in  diverse  forms:  publications,  technical  reports, \nworkshop  papers,  seminar  proceedings,  and  digital  files.  Access  is  difficult  and  there  is  no \nupdated  directory  or  metadatabase  for  stakeholders  to  consult.  What  is  more,  data  quality  is \noften questionable because that there is no mechanism for validation and aggregation. In short, \nthere  is  no  comprehensive  environmental  information  database  that  offers  an  official  and \ncommon  service.  Developing  such  a  database  is  urgent  to  backstop  natural  resource \nmanagement coordination and planning for the TSBR. To this intent, the Project will establish in \nthe TSBR Secretariat an environmental information database (TSBR-ED) that will serve as an \ninformation  clearinghouse  open  to  all.  Fittingly,  the  TSBR-ED will build on the  United Nations \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization's  (UNESCO)  experience  in  environmental \ndata  management,  especially  on  its  MABnet,  and  Biosphere  Reserve  Integrated  Monitoring \ninitiative.1 \n \nB. \n \n\nApproach to Database Development \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Outputs \n\n \n2. \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  Establishing  the  TSBR-ED  will  help  to \naccomplish  the  objective  of  strengthened  natural  resource  management  coordination  and \nplanning for the TSBR. The needed outputs to establish the TSBR-ED are as follows: (i) building \nan  efficient  information  clearinghouse  mechanism;  (ii)  establishing  a  database  to  support \nmanagement planning, environmental assessment, and public information; (iii) establishing and \nmaintaining  a  TSBR  web  site;  (iv)  developing  TSBR  publications  on  environment  and \ndevelopment;  and  (v)  establishing  a  documentation  center.  When  it  is  established,  the  TSBR-\nED  will  constitute  an  important  tool  of  Government  agencies,  specialized  institutions, \nenvironmental  education  projects,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  the  private  sector, \nand the aid community. \n \n\n2. \n\nKey Activities by Output \n\n \n\na. \n\nBuilding an Efficient Information Clearinghouse Mechanism \n\n \n3. \nThe TSBR Secretariat needs an information clearinghouse mechanism. This mechanism \nshould  consist  of  well-prepared  work  plans,  information  services  and  products,  and  data \nmanagement  capacity,  buttressed  by  qualified  technical  staff  and  equipment.  A  series  of \n                                                 \n1  The  Biosphere  Reserve  Integrated  Monitoring  initiative  undertakes  a  biotic,  biodiversity,  socioeconomic,  and \nintegrated  monitoring  in  UNESCO's  World  Network  of  Biosphere  Reserves.  Its  goal  is  to  provide  a platform for \nintegration  of  the  resulting  information  and  data,  thus  contributing  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  changes  that \ntake  place  in  the  areas  studied,  the  factors  triggering  those  changes,  and  the  options  for  planning  and \nmanagement. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\ntechnical agreements will be established to facilitate exchange of data and information between \nstakeholders.  Project  activities  will  include  elaborating  agreements  for  information  collection, \nmanagement, and exchange; designing and implementing technical work plans;  identifying and \nrecruiting qualified technical staff; and installing the equipment required. \n \n\nb. \n\nEstablishing  a  Database \nEnvironmental Assessment, and Public Information \n\nto  Support  Management  Planning, \n\n \nThe  database  will  integrate  or  link  with  existing  databases  and  will  be  supported  by  a \n4 \ngeographic information system (GIS) and other technologies (Table A5). Efforts will be made to \nvalidate  and  aggregate  data  and  databases  to  provide  a  common  and  official  set  on  natural \nresource management in the Tonle Sap. The TSBR-ED, however, will not duplicate or replace \nother specialized databases.

The  publications  will  be  in \nprinted  form  or  on  CD-ROM.  Related  project  activities  will  include  designing,  preparing, \npublishing, and distributing the following products: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\na bimonthly newsletter, titled Tonle Sap Update\u2014Bulletin of the TSBR. This will \nbe a simple product of 2\u20134 pages, focusing on management and development in \nthe Tonle Sap; \na Tonle Sap Environment and Development Data Report, prepared by the TSBR \nSecretariat,  with  the  support  of  the  TSBR-ED.  This  product  will  be  issued \nannually and will be used as Cambodia\u2019s official environmental data report for the \nTonle  Sap.  It  will  also  serve  as  a  long-standing  record  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  New \ninformation  will  be  added  and  corrections  made  as \nimplementation of projects in the Tonle Sap region progresses, and \nthe five directories in para. 5. \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\ne. \n\nEstablishing a Documentation Center \n\n \n8. \nThe  TSBR-ED  will  house  a  documentation  center  to  collect  and  organize  related \ndocuments  such  as  books,  special  publications,  survey  reports,  workshop  reports,  seminar \nproceedings,  and  project  documents.  First  and  foremost,  the  documentation  center  will  serve \nthe  TSBR  Secretariat  and  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  involved  in  the  Project.  It \nwill then be opened to other Government agencies, institutions, and NGOs. The documentation \ncenter  will  use  UNESCO  library  software  such  as  CDS-ISIS  or  WinISIS  for  management.3 \nProject  activities  will  include documentation collection, categorization, indexing, management, \nand servicing. \n \n\n                                                 \n2  It is more cost-effective to use existing web site holders in Phnom Penh. It is also possible for UNESCO to host the \n\nweb pages, at least initially. \n\n3   This UNESCO software has been used in libraries and documentation centers around the world for more than 15 \n\nyears. Some training in its use will be given. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\n3. \n\nOther Considerations \n\n \n9. \nOperational  Strategy.  The  Project  will  aim  to  deliver  TSBR-ED services as quickly as \npossible.  The  TSBR  web  site,  the  bimonthly  newsletter,  and  the  five  directories  will  be  moved \nrapidly into service. They will be consolidated and improved thereafter. Database development \nwill focus first on core data and extend gradually to other data attributes. \n \n10. \nClient Targeting.  Project  beneficiaries  will  include  Government  agencies,  bilateral  and \nmultilateral institutions, NGOs, and the general public. They all need general information on the \nTonle Sap. Three categories will enjoy specific TSBR-ED services: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nGovernment  and  donor  agencies.  This  category  includes  line  ministries \nconcerned  with  the  Tonle  Sap,  provincial  government  offices,  and  the  agencies \ninvolved  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  Given  the  responsibility  of  these  bodies  in \nmanagement  and  development  planning,  policy  work,  law  interpretation  and \nenforcement,  and  governance,  the  TSBR-ED\u2019s  main  tasks  for  this  group  of \nbeneficiaries  will  include:  (a)  collecting  and  providing  the  major  national  and \ninternational  legal  and  policy  documents  of  relevance  to  the  Tonle  Sap  and  the \nTSBR;4  (b)  collecting  and  facilitating  exchange  of  documents  on  TSBR-related \nprojects  or  meetings  supported  by  the  Government  and  aid  agencies  with  prior \nagreement with the agencies concerned;5 (c) providing basic but comprehensive \nand  updated  conservation,  environmental,  natural  resource,  and  socioeconomic \ndata through established databases;6 and (d) providing a comprehensive index or \nmeta-database  about  other  existing  specialized  databases  hosted  by  other \norganizations, as well as literature and documentation. \nCivil  society.  This  category  includes  all  sectors  of  society,  in  particular,  local \nvillage councils, schools, and the private sector. Through the TSBR web site and \npublications,  the  TSBR-ED  will  provide  information  services  on:  (a)  the \nregulations  and  policies  regarding  natural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR; \n(b) the values, characteristics, and sustainability of the Tonle Sap ecosystem; (c) \nthe  environmental  and  developmental  problems  encountered  and \nthe \nenvironmental  status  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  (d)  previous  and  ongoing  efforts  for \nnatural  resource  management  in  the  TSBR;  (e)  new  development  opportunities \nconcerning  the  TSBR;  (f)  traditional  knowledge  and  best  practices  for  natural \nresource  management,  as  well  as  examples  of  unsustainable  uses;  (g)  a \ndirectory of institutions and NGOs that may be contacted to support community \ndevelopment;  (h)  a  metadatabase  on  other  existing  specialized  databases, \nincluding  literature  and  documentation;  and  (j)  environmental  education  and \nawareness. \nNGOs. Many NGOs work in the Tonle Sap region. They deal with a broad range \nof  issues,  including  wildlife  protection,  conservation,  research,  environment, \ncommunity organization and development, education, health, and empowerment \nof  women.  These  NGOs  will  be  substantial  contributors  of  data  for  collection, \ndistribution, and verification. They will be a major group of clients targeted by the \n\n                                                 \n4   For instance, basic documents on the  Seville Strategy for Biosphere Reserves, 1995; the Statutory Framework of \nthe World Network of Biosphere Reserves; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild \nFauna  and  Flora  (CITES),  1979;  and  the  Convention  on  Wetlands  of  International  Importance  especially  as \nWaterfowl Habitat (the Ramsar Convention), 1971. \n\n5   Much data and information will not be in the public domain. Rules and policies for exchange and distribution will be \n\ndeveloped and applied. \n\n6   This data is usually descriptive. After establishment of the TSBR-ED, a basic GIS capacity will be made available \n\nfor additional information support, notably through annual publication of environmental data. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nTSBR-ED,  together  with  university  departments  in  Cambodia.  In  addition,  the \nTSBR-ED will develop: (a) a directory of NGOs working in the Tonle Sap region; \n(b)  a  directory  of  aid  agencies  that  are  active  in  the  Tonle  Sap;  and  (c) \nmechanisms whereby NGOs can use the TSBR-ED as a conduit for exchanging \nexperience and making their expertise available. \n\n \n11. \nUsing and Linking with Existing Databases. The TSBR-ED will not duplicate existing \ndatabases. As much as it can, it will use existing data resources and pay particular attention  to \nmetadatabase development. Its object will be to make information available. \n \n12. \nComputer Technology. The TSBR-ED will not seek to take high-end and state-of-the-\nart equipment for routine database management and information distribution. Rather, it will use \ncommonly  used  technologies,  such  as  the  PC  NT  Server  and  Windows  2000  SQL  Server,  to \nback up its web and database service, and PC-based GIS, such as Arc-View and MapInfo, for \ngeographic data processing. This will ensure better maintenance, given the technical capacity of \nstaff  and  available  service  in  the  country.  Specific  data  processing  will  be  contracted  to \nprofessional data processing workshops in Cambodia or to other facilities in the region. This will \nensure that the TSBR Secretariat does not require too many staff or equipment. For the TSBR \nweb site, use will be made of commercial technical maintenance services. \n \nLanguage.  The  TSBR-ED  will  use  the  Khmer  and English languages. Attention will be \n13. \ngiven to Khmer versions of information products such as web pages, the bimonthly bulletin, and \nCD-ROMs.  Arrangements  will  be  made  to  translate  scientific  data  into  the  Khmer  language  to \nmake it available for educational purposes. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nUNESCO will be appointed by direct selection to establish the TSBR-ED with assistance \nfrom  its  offices  in  Phnom  Penh,  Jakarta,  and  Paris.  UNESCO's  office  in  Phnom   Penh  will \ncoordinate execution. The TSBR Secretariat and UNESCO will prepare the work plan jointly and \ncarry out the detailed design and implementation of the TSBR-ED. Short-term expertise will be \nneeded  for  system  design,  standard  setting  and  integration,  development  of  data  exchange \nmechanisms, and preparation of publications. For this, priority will be given to domestic experts. \nFor  specific  technical  tasks  such  as  field  data  collection,  data  processing,  technical \nmaintenance,  publication  design,  and  printing,  subcontracts  will  be  entered  into.  UNESCO's \nMan  and  the  Biosphere  Secretariat  in  the  Division  of  Ecological  Sciences  and  the  Regional \nBureau of Sciences for Asia and Pacific will provide advisory services and supervise the quality \nof the TSBR-ED's services and products. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n39 \n\nFORMULATING AND IMPLEMENTING A NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AND \nAWARENESS CAMPAIGN \n\nBackground \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nSustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  are a \npriority  for  Cambodia,  which  relies  heavily  on  land,  water,  and  biotic  resources  and  is  on  the \nverge  of  rapid  urban,  industrial,  and  agricultural  development.  In  such  cases,  environmental \npolicies should be fitted to the conditions and traditions of the country. Implementation will not \nbe  successful  without  the  active  participation  of  all  citizens,  especially  those  who  depend  on \nnatural resources. \n \nWhen Cambodia nominated in 1996 the Tonle Sap for designation by the United Nations \n2. \nEducational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization  (UNESCO)  as  a  biosphere  reserve,  the \nGovernment  recognized  that  the  site  should  respond  to  the  conservation,  development,  and \nlogistic  functions  of  a  biosphere  reserve  and  that  education and public awareness should be \ngiven  importance.  At  the  national  level,  information  on  conservation  and  sustainable  use,  as \npracticed in biosphere reserves, should be included in school programs and teaching manuals \nand in media efforts. At the local level, involvement of local communities should be encouraged, \ninformation  for  visitors  should  be  produced,  and  environmental  education  centers  should  be \npromoted. \n \n3. \nSince its creation in 1993, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) has worked toward such \nends.1  As  a  result,  an  Interministerial  Steering  Committee  for  Environmental  Education \n(IMSCEE)  was  established  that  year  with  assistance  from  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme's  (UNDP\u2019s)  Environmental  Technical  Assistance  Project  (ETAP).  UNESCO  was \nassociated  with  related  environmental  education  activities,  particularly  with  developing \nenvironmental education materials for school curricula and producing teacher guides for primary \nand secondary schools. A special program for educating monks was also put in place. However, \nmany  of  these  activities  were  interrupted  when  ETAP  ended  in  1998.  Considering  the \nimportance of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) and the severity of the threats against \nit,  it  is  urgent  that  progress  in  environmental  education  and  awareness  continue  and  that  a \nnational campaign be mounted in support. This would also help Cambodia to meet obligations \nunder the Convention on Biological Diversity, 1992 that stress the importance of education and \npublic awareness on biodiversity. \n \nB. \n \n\nApproach to Campaign Formulation and Implementation \n\n1. \n\nObjective and Outputs \n\n \nThe  goal  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural \n4. \nresources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  The  objective  that  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  a  national  environmental  education  and  awareness  campaign  will  help  to \naccomplish  is  strengthened  natural  resource  management  coordination  and  planning  for  the \nTSBR,  particularly  by  establishing  a  coordination  framework  and  information  dissemination \nmechanisms. The outputs needed to formulate and implement the campaign are as follows (i) \npublicizing  the  Tonle  Sap's  environmental  importance;  (ii)  integrating  concern  for  natural \nresources;  and  (iii)  developing  formal  and  nonformal  environmental  education.  These outputs \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Department  of  Environmental  Education  and  Communication  has  23  staff  and  four  offices  for  education  and \n\ntraining, communication, research and documentation, and administration. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nwill be defined by the target audience, i.e., the general public and the press, decision makers, \nschoolchildren (at primary and secondary levels), university students, and communities living in \nthe Tonle Sap region. \n \n\n2. \n\nKey Activities by Output \n\n \n\na. \n\nPublicizing the Tonle Sap's Environmental Importance \n\n \nEncouraging the Press. The Cambodian Communication Institute, which is supported \n5. \nby  UNESCO,  will  include  information  sessions  on  the  environment  and  the  Tonle  Sap  in  its \ntraining courses. In addition, a document in the Khmer language will be distributed to the press \nto explain the significance of the TSBR and publicize efforts to enhance systems and develop \nthe  capacity  for  natural  resource  management  coordination  and  planning,  community-based \nnatural resource management, and biodiversity conservation in the TSBR. Periodic information \nconferences for journalists will also be organized. Full use will be made of the TSBR web site to \nbe developed in the  TSBR environmental information database  (TSBR-ED). The activities will \nbe undertaken in close cooperation with the Ministry of Information. \n \n6. \nEnhancing  Public  Awareness.  In  rural  areas,  access  to  television  is  still  limited. \nHowever,  collective  television  watching  is  a  common  practice.  A  series  of  spots  on  the  Tonle \nSap  will  be  produced  and  a  quiz  show  will  be  launched  on  the  subject  of  biodiversity \nconservation  in  the  Tonle  Sap.  An  image  bank  on  the  Tonle  Sap  will  be  created  and  made \navailable  to  the  press.  Radio  programs  will  be  encouraged  for  coverage  in  Cambodia  is  wide \nand  reaches  remote  rural  areas.  Regular  short  broadcasts about environmental issues will be \nlaunched.  To  reach  the  general  public,  special  events  will  be  organized  on  the  theme  of  the \nTonle Sap\u2014theater plays, contests, and traveling exhibits.2 Existing events such as the Water \nFestival, the National Environment Day, and the Clean Up Day will also present opportunities for \na special focus on the Tonle Sap.3 Participatory activities such as tree planting campaigns will \nbe  encouraged  and  should  receive  enough  press  coverage  to  have  a  pedagogic  impact. \nAdditionally, use of the pagoda network will provide a way to reach communities, especially in \nremote areas. Pagodas are present in almost every commune of the country. They are places \nwhere  people  meet  and  often  include  libraries  and  primary  schools.  UNESCO  implemented a \nCommunity  Temple  Learning  Center  Program  in  Siem  Reap  and  Battambang  in  1994\u20131999. \nThe  structure  of  that  program  proved  to  be  particularly  appropriate  for  non-formal education: \n20,000  people  completed  basic  literacy  courses,  1,500  completed  skill  training  courses,  and \n1,500  young  children  received  basic  instruction.  This  network  will  be  used  to  disseminate \ninformation on the environment. The emerging network of community learning centers will also \nbe used. \n \n\nb. \n\nIntegrating Concern for Natural Resources \n\n \n7. \nInforming  Decision  Makers.  Establishment  under  the  Project  of  a  web  site  in  the \nTSBR-ED  and  production  of  a  bimonthly  newsletter,  titled  Tonle  Sap  Update\u2014Bulletin of the \nTSBR will help to inform decision makers. The document\u2014prepared to explain the significance \nof  the  TSBR,  and  publicize  efforts  to  enhance  systems  and  develop  the  capacity  for  natural \nresource  management  coordination  and  planning,  community-based  natural  resource \nmanagement,  and  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  TSBR\u2014will be distributed to ministries and \n\n                                                 \n2  The exhibit on the Tonle Sap produced by Krousar Thmey, and supported by UNESCO, could serve as the basis \n\nfor traveling exhibits. \n\n3  One of the Peace Walks organized each year could be organized around the Tonle Sap, starting from Angkor. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n41 \n\ninstitutions  at  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  levels.  Workshops  on  issues  and  problems \nrelated to management of the Tonle Sap will be organized on an ad hoc basis. \n \n8. \nEstablishing  a  Forum  for  Discussion.  The  IMSCEE,  which  was  established  in  1996 \nand discontinued in December 1998, will be reactivated and the Ministry of Information will be \nadded  to  its  original  members.4 The IMSCEE will meet  once a year to discuss environmental \neducation  and  awareness  issues  related  to  the  Tonle  Sap  and  to  set  targets.  The  TSBR \nSecretariat will act as its secretariat. \n \n\nc. \n\nDeveloping Formal and Nonformal Environmental Education \n\n \n9. \nPreparing Educational Materials. As part of ETAP (with assistance from UNESCO), a \nteacher\u2019s  manual  for  primary  schools  was  prepared  and  distributed  in  1998.  At  the  secondary \nschool  level,  five  of  the  nine  training  modules  prepared  by  UNESCO's Asia Pacific Center of \nEducational  Innovation  for  Development  in  Bangkok  were  translated  into  the  Khmer  language \nand distributed through the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports.  Recently, a set of posters \nproduced by UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Secretariat in Paris were translated into \nthe  Khmer  language  and  published.  They  are  now  being  tested  among  teachers.  Much \nadditional  material,  such  as  the  School  Teacher's  Guide  on  the  Environment  or  MOE's  Green \nBook  remain  unpublished  or  not  distributed.  Previous  and  ongoing  work  in  preparing \neducational  materials  will  be  examined  with  a  view  to  completing  or  extending  it.  The formal \nmonk  education  program  initiated  by  ETAP  will  also  be  continued  after  considering \nrecommendations from a national workshop held in 1998. Moreover, the status of a manual for \nBuddhist primary school teachers, which was being prepared then, will be examined for possible \ncompletion. In addition, awareness and use of the TSBR web site will be promoted in schools \nthat have access to the Internet. \n \n10. \nImproving  the  Training  of  Teachers.  Training  of  teachers  remains  a  priority.  Four \nteacher-training  centers  are  located  in  Battambang,  Kompong  Chhnang,  Kompong  Thom,  and \nSiem Reap. At least two training sessions per annum, each for 20 teachers, will be organized in \neach  center.  A  field  visit  to  the  Tonle  Sap  will  be  part  of  the  training.  This  means  that  160 \nteachers  (from  primary  and  secondary  schools)  will  be  trained  each  year.  The  schools from \nwhich  they  originate  will  serve  as  pilot  sites  for  the  environmental  education  and  awareness \ncampaign, taking into account the school cluster system. In addition, training and field visits will \nbe organized for teachers in schools within the TSBR, particularly those teaching in the floating \nvillages. \n \n11. \nFostering  Nonformal  Education  Activities.  Nongovernment organizations undertake \nmany nonformal education activities. Their activities will be studied with a view to extending or \nreplicating  them.  Teachers  will  be  encouraged  to  include  nonformal  education  activities  to \ncomplement the formal school system.  Schools in the TSBR will be involved in more interactive \nactivities,  including  production  of  material  by  children  (including  audiovisual  material  when \npossible)  as  well  as  drawing  and  painting  competitions.  Field  visits  to  the  Tonle  Sap  will  be \norganized for children. \n \n12. \nExpanding  Environmental  Training  at  Phnom  Penh  University.  Two  years  ago,  a \nDepartment  of  Environment  was  established  in  Phnom  Penh  University.  Under  the  Project,  its \nstudents will receive special training on hydrology and wetlands ecology. Field visits will also be \norganized to encourage students to undertake studies on the Tonle Sap. UNESCO, through its \n\n                                                 \n4  They were MOE; the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports; and the Ministry of Religion and Cults. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nWorld Network of Biosphere Reserves, will facilitate exchange of students between Cambodia \nand other countries of the Asian and Pacific region endowed with biosphere reserves.5 \n \n\n3. \n\nMethodology \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n13.  Wherever  possible,  project  activities  will  complement  ongoing  initiatives.6  For  that \nreason, a survey will assess existing networks, activities, and materials, and identify additional \nrequirements. This is especially important for teaching materials. Capacity building also implies \nthat  the  Project  will  make  maximum  use  of  national  counterparts  and  that  the  role  of \ninternational experts will be kept to a minimum. \n \nC. \n \n14. \nUNESCO will be appointed by direct selection to implement the national environmental \neducation  and  awareness  campaign  with  the  Department  of  Environmental  Education  and \nCommunication  within  MOE.  Designated  focal  points  will  be  identified  in  each  concerned \nministry  to  ensure  that  the  project  activities  defined  for  each  ministry  are  undertaken  on \nschedule.  UNESCO\u2019s  office  in  Phnom  Penh  will  be  responsible  for  implementation,  in  close \nassociation  with  UNESCO\u2019s  office  in  Bangkok.  UNESCO\u2019s  office  in  Jakarta  and  the  MAB \nSecretariat  in  Paris  will  backstop  activities  as  appropriate.  It  is  foreseen  that  the  preparatory \nphase  of  the  campaign  will  last  6  months  and  that  the  campaign  itself  will  spread  over  the \nremaining project implementation period. \n\n                                                 \n5 The World Network fosters exchanges between biosphere reserves and facilitates cooperative activities, including \n\nscientific research and monitoring, environmental education, and specialist training. \n\n6  These  include  initiatives  carried  out  by  the  floating  environmental  center  (Greater  Environment  Chong  Khneas \nOffice  [GECKO])  funded  under  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the  United  Nation\u2019s  project  for \nParticipatory  Natural  Resources  Management  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Region:  Osmose;  the  Wildlife  Conservation \nSociety; the Cambodian Family Development Service; and Leucaena. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nGENERAL APPROACH TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION \n\n \n1. \nProject activities to organize communities for natural resource management in the Tonle \nSap  Biosphere  Reserve  (TSBR)  will  concentrate  in  the  first  year  on  appointing,  in  each  of  the \nfive project provinces, the incremental staff required in the Department of Agriculture, Forestry, \nand  Fisheries  and  the  Department  of  Environment;  improving  office  facilities;  and  identifying \nqualified  nongovernment  organizations (NGOs) to facilitate community  organization.  The Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will be appointed by direct selection to \nprovide long-term advisory support.1 \n \n2. \nFrom  the  beginning  of  the  second  year,  in  each  project  province,  16  staff  of  the \nDepartment  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries;  4  staff  of  the  Department  of  Environment, \nand 4\u20135 staff of the NGOs identified will be trained in participatory approaches, development  of \ncriteria  for  selecting  communities  to  organize,  community  organization,  participatory  land  use \nplanning, and preparation of natural resource management plans.2 This staff will be sensitized \nto gender-and-development concerns. FAO will conduct the required training through on-the-job \ntraining, workshops, and seminars. \n \n3. \nThe  Project  will  collect  baseline  information  on  communities  to  prioritize  them,  taking \naccount  of  the  particular  needs  of  structures  already  set  up  for  community-based  natural \nresource  management.3  Information  on  communities  collected  in  the  process  of  prioritizing \ntargets will also serve for project monitoring and evaluation. \n \n4. \nOrganizing  communities  for  natural  resource  management  will  begin  with  training  and \nadvice to promote their cohesion. The rights, responsibilities, and customs of each community \nstructure  will  be  elaborated  and  individual  responsibilities  will  be  clarified.  By  the  beginning  of \nthe  second  year,  the  process  of  boundary  definition  and  delineation  will  have  begun  using \nground survey techniques and the orthophotomaps produced under the Project, as they become \navailable.  Areas  of  communal  use,  including  designated  protection  areas  and  local  fish \nsanctuaries, will be delineated and boundaries proposed for agreement through a participatory \nconsultative process. Local techniques for demarcating key boundaries will be applied. \n \nOnce  the  community  structures  are  established,  weekly  meetings  will  be  held  with \n5. \nleaders,  members  of  village  communities,  representatives  of  households  with  female  heads, \nand representatives of poor households to familiarize them with the objective, components, and \noutputs  of  the  Project;  the  5-year  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan;  and  the  evolving \nregulatory  framework.  The  meetings  will  also  offer  advice  on  their  natural  resource  base,  the \n                                                 \n1  Specifically, FAO will: (i) conduct, in consultation with NGOs and in a spirit of shared decision making, a review of \nprevious approaches to community organization that have been applied in the Project area, for example by FAO \nand  the  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit;  (ii)  refine,  in  consultation  with  NGOs,  the  preferred \napproach  with  reference  to  the  indicative  approach  given  here;  (iii)  detail,  in  consultation  with  NGOs,  project \nactivities  to  organize  communities  for  natural  resource  management;  (iv)  marshal  staff  of  the  provincial  line \nagencies and the NGOs required in the field; and (v) generally manage the process of organizing communities for \nnatural resource management in the TSBR. In refining the preferred approach, FAO will prepare a comprehensive \nmethodology and work plan and establish an integrated management system comprising management tools such \nas  hierarchy  of  objectives,  tree  analysis,  stakeholder  analysis,  project  (logical)  framework,  work  breakdown \nstructure, bar chart, Gantt chart, organization responsibility chart, and individual task chart. \n\n2  Preferably, at least half of the staff from each Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries will be drawn from \n\nthe Community Fisheries Development Unit. \n\n3  This  baseline  information  will  relate,  for  instance,  to  livelihoods,  income  earning  activities,  levels  of  conflict  over \naccess  to  natural  resources,  conflict  resolution  mechanisms,  nature  of  indebtedness,  households  with  female \nheads,  ethnic  minorities,  gender  divisions  of  labor,  patterns  of  control  over  fisheries  activities,  and  training  and \nextension needs. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nrights  of  different  groups  of  users  (which  will  need  to  be  identified  and  documented using a \nvariety  of  methods),  their  roles  and  responsibilities  as  community  members,  the  benefits  of \nequal  participation  by  women,  the  need  to  form  community  bylaws,  and  conflict  resolution \nmechanisms. These weekly meetings will require that staff travel to the villages at times that suit \nthe  schedules  of  each  community.  Approximately  6  months  will  be  required  before  the \ncommunity  agrees  on  the  approach  to  community-based  natural  resource  management  and \nsufficient capacity is created among community leaders for them to undertake such functions as \npatrolling, monitoring, accounting, and bookkeeping. Thereafter, staff will continue to interact to \nencourage communities to formulate natural resource management plans and build the capacity \nof women to participate in decision making. \n \n6. \nToward the end of the second year, staff in each project province will hold a participatory \nworkshop to publicize the results of community organization and encourage feedback. From the \nthird  year,  the  Project  will  extend  its  reach  to  other  communities.  At  the  same  time,  however, \nstaff  will  have  to  backstop  the  communities  organized  earlier.  Project  staff  will  need  to \ncontinuously  work  in  the  field  in  training  and  extension  at  the  village  level,  training  women\u2019s \ngroups for full participation, developing the knowledge and skills of the members of community \nfisheries and community forestry groups, training the community in participatory demarcation of \narea boundaries, developing dynamic rules and regulations that will reflect changing scenarios \nas  community-based  management  systems  become  stronger,  developing \nresource \ndemarcation, and evolving strategies for natural resource management over time. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT  AND NATURAL RESOURCES SECTOR \n\nProject Title  \n\nDuration \n\nSource  \n\nObjectives \n\nArea of Operation \n\nEnvironment and Natural Resources \n\nOngoing \n\nMRC, \nDenmark \n\nTo study socioeconomics and \ncommunity organization for improved \nmanagement \n\nOngoing \n\nMRC \n\n  \u2014 \n\nMekong region \n\nAmount \n(million) \n\n \n\n \n\n  $2.3 \n\nNational \n\nOngoing \n\nMRC \n\n  \u2014 \n\nMekong region \n\n2001\u20132004  MRC \n\n  \u2014 \n\nTonle Sap \n\nCambodia Climate \nChange \nAssistance \n\nOngoing \n\nUNDP, \nGEF \n\n1995\u20131998 \n1998\u20132001 \n2001\u20132003 \n\nFAO, \nBelgium \n\n  $0.3 \n\nNational \n\n  \u2014 \n\nSiem Reap \n\n2000\u20132003  World Bank, \n\nGEF \n\n  $4.9 \n\nRatanakiri and \nStung Treng \n\n2001\u20132006 \n\nDanida \n\n  \u2014 \n\nNational \n\nTo collect data on ecology and \nsocioeconomics for use in planning \nwater management projects and in the \ndesign of fisheries management \nsystems  \nTo develop aquaculture systems to \nexplore the feasibility of breeding \nindigenous fish species  \n\nTo establish databases for (i) national \nMekong Basin capture and culture \nfisheries, and (ii) regional capture and \nculture fisheries;

step  forward  when,  in  October  2000,  it \nreleased a large part  of the Tonle Sap's fishing lots for community management. This decision \ngave impetus to the reform of the regulatory framework for inland fisheries. Work toward a new \nlaw  on  fishery  conservation,  management,  and  development  had  begun  in  August  1999  (with \nassistance from the World Bank) and a draft was made available in August 2001. Nevertheless, \nmost  observers  have  felt,  in  light  of  the  far-reaching  implications  of  that  law  and  the  sensitive \nnature of any change affecting community fisheries, that stakeholders should subject the draft to \ncritical  review.  Much  additional  harmonized  legislation  also  needs  to  be  formulated  and  the \nDepartment of Fisheries (DOF) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) is \nstruggling to keep up with the menu  of regulatory reform in a transparent and consultative way, \nespecially in the absence of a management plan for the Tonle Sap. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  fishing  lot  system  was  introduced  in  colonial  times  and  has  tended  to  dominate \ninland  fisheries.1  While  a  potentially  powerful  and  effective  fisheries  and  natural  resource \nmanagement  tool,  the  fishing  lot  system  has  become  increasingly  inequitable,  divisive,  and \ndestructive. On 24 October 2000, in the face of long-running conflict between local communities \nand  fishing  lot  operators,  a  Prime  Ministerial  decree  released  56%  of  the  total  fishing  lot  area \nfrom private holdings and turned them over to communities for management.2 In the long term, \nthis change should benefit the population living near inland water bodies, improve fish habitats, \nand  lead  to  sustainable  management  of  fisheries  and  other  natural  resources.  But  the  reform \nprocess was driven by prime ministerial decree, and not the result of policy development. The \nidentification  and  delineation  of  areas  of  fishing  lots  for  community-based management have \nbeen  difficult.  Communities  have  not  always  been  sufficiently  involved  in  this  process  nor \nproperly  informed  of  changes,  and  there  are  reports  of  irregularities.  In  certain locations, local \nauthorities  and  armed  forces  interfere  with  legitimate  resource  users  from  communities \nattempting to fish in these lots, even to the extent of arresting them and taking them to court. As \nthe  process  of  redefinition  evolves,  rapid  changes are also occurring in practices that impact \nfisheries and other natural resources. The reform process is also placing a considerable burden \non DOF, which suffers from low levels of capacity. Aside from its stated objective for fisheries \nmanagement,  it  has  little  management  vision  and  focuses,  understandably,  on  maintaining \nexisting procedures and methods.3 What is more, the absence of a fisheries management plan \nfor  the  Tonle  Sap  hampers  the  work  on  the  draft  Fisheries  Law  and  the  subdecrees, \nproclamations, and directives or circulars associated with it. \n\n                                                 \n1  Fishing lots are auctioned every 2 years to individuals who operate the lots themselves  or sublease them to others. \n2   To facilitate this radical change, DOF then established a Community Fisheries Development Office, charged with \n\npromoting and supporting community-based management of natural resources. \n\n3  DOF's objective is to manage Cambodia's fisheries in a sustainable manner to improve the livelihood and nutrition \n\nof the people and to increase aquaculture production. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14     63 \n\nImproving the Regulatory Framework \n\n1. \n \n3. \nThere  is  an  urgent  need  to  provide  a  sound  legal  basis  for  fisheries,  especially  inland. \nSeveral  subdecrees  already  have  been  prepared  and  some  may  be  implemented  before  the \nadoption  of  the  Fisheries  Law.  However,  hasty  enactment  should  be  avoided.  Some  existing \ndrafts have been criticized and need to be reviewed for relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, and \nequity  so  as  to  achieve  sustainable  management  and  conservation  of  natural  resources  and \nbiodiversity. Among these are subdecrees that have special relevance to the Tonle Sap, such \nas  those  on  community  fisheries  and  management  of  fishing  lots.  Their  preparation  should be \norganic  and  grow  out  of  experience,  local  practice,  potentialities,  and  needs.  In  general,  a \npositive approach to ensuring compliance with the law is preferable to a negative approach that \nrequires policing action. Experience demonstrates that negative approaches encourage bribery \nand  extortion,  not  compliance.  The  need  to  consult  stakeholders  should  also  be  recognized \nearly in the drafting and review process: consultation at both national and local levels should be \nstandard operating procedure. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving the Management Framework \n\n \n4. \nA 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan is essential to sustainable management \nand  conservation  of  natural  resources  and  biodiversity:  most  management  issues  transcend \nlocal  responsibilities  or  competences,  with  repercussions  on  the  ecosystem.  A  fisheries \nmanagement  plan  will  provide  a  policy  and  technical  framework  and  incorporate  principles  for \necosystem  management,  inasmuch  as  fishing  takes  place  in  different  zones  (i.e., community \nfisheries, fishing lots, protected areas, and open waters). It will also feed into the common policy \nobjectives for the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve (TSBR) that are to be formulated by the TSBR \nSecretariat in the Cambodia National Mekong Committee. At the local level, the plan will provide \nthe  framework  for  developing  commercial  and  community  fisheries  management  plans.  The \npreparation  and  regular  updating  of  fisheries  management  plans  are  a  legal  requirement  in \nmany countries: such plans complement  and  influence  the  regulatory  framework  in  a  dynamic \nand adaptive manner.1 \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Technical Assistance \n\n1. \n\nObjective \n\n \n5. \nThe goal of the technical assistance (TA) is sustainable management and conservation \nof  natural  resources  and  biodiversity  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin.  Its  objective  is  to  improve  the \nregulatory  and  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  with  special  attention  to  the \nsubdecree on community fisheries. \n \n\n2. \n\nMethodology \n\n \n6. \nTo improve the regulatory framework, the methodology for the TA will follow a step-by-\nstep  process  of  stocktaking,  drafting,  and  validation  involving  stakeholders  at  national, \nprovincial,  and  local  levels.  Stocktaking  will  involve  organizing  four  national  technical \nconsultations. Validation will involve organizing four national consultations aimed at discussing \nand validating draft reports.  To  improve  the  management  framework,  the  methodology  for  the \nTA will lay stress on close collaboration with a Tonle Sap Fisheries Management Task Force to \n\n                                                 \n1  Indeed,  the  Master  Plan  for  Fisheries  (2001-2011) in Cambodia (prepared with assistance from the World Bank) \n\nrefers explicitly to the need to develop management plans for Cambodia's main fisheries bodies. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nbe nominated before inception of the TA. It will also emphasize hands-on training of counterpart \nstaff,  simultaneous  presence  of  specialists,  thorough  preparation,  and  maintaining  the \nmomentum of the delivery of key activities. \n \n\n3. \n\nKey Activities by Output \n\na. \n\nImproving the Regulatory Framework \n\nKey activities relate to the following: \n(i) \n\nframework,  challenges,  and  opportunities;  and  making \n\nMobilizing  specialists  and  conducting  basic  research  on  information  (including \nidentifying and collating laws and subdecrees); \nReviewing  the  management  of  commercial,  community,  and  other  important \nfisheries in the Tonle Sap; \nLaying  out  an  approach  to  improving  the  regulatory  framework  for  inland \nfisheries;  drafting  a  preliminary  report  setting  out  the  scope  of  the  existing \nregulatory \ninitial \nrecommendations at a legal consultative and training forum; \nArticulating a time frame for the review of draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, \nand  directives  or  circulars  related  to  inland  fisheries,  in  particular  a  draft \nsubdecree  or  amendment \nfisheries \nmanagement; \nRefining the approach to improving the regulatory framework for inland fisheries \nbased on responses at the legal consultative and training forum; \nConducting further consultations culminating in a  legal  consultative  and  training \nforum in which draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, and directives or circulars \nrelated  to  inland  fisheries,  as  amended  after  the  consultative  process,  will  be \npresented; \n\nto  any  subdecree  on  community \n\n(vii)  Drafting a final report setting out final draft laws, subdecrees, proclamations, and \n\ndirectives or circulars related to inland fisheries; and \n\n(viii)  Consolidating training to increase legislative awareness in DOF. \n\nb. \n\nImproving the Management Framework \n\nKey activities relate to the following: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nEstablishing a Tonle Sap Fisheries Management Task Force in DOF; \nReviewing and evaluating documentation and information on fisheries resources; \npast  and  current  fisheries  management  frameworks  and  practices,  especially \nwith  respect  to  access  conditions,  fishing  regulations,  monitoring,  compliance, \nand enforcement; national and sectoral policies and priorities, taking into account \nall  sectors  relevant  to  the  management  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  development  trends; \ncommunity  organization;  livelihood  systems;  and  other  socioeconomic  aspects \nrelevant to the management of the Tonle Sap's fisheries; \nConducting  consultations  on  community  fisheries  management,  commercial \nfisheries management, and Tonle Sap fisheries management in general; \nPreparing a draft diagnosis, and broad-based and fisheries-specific management \nprinciples; \nValidating  the  draft  diagnosis  and  management  principles  through  consultation \nand fieldwork; \nOrganizing  provincial-level  group  discussions  on  the  draft  diagnosis  and \nmanagement principles with representative stakeholders; \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(v) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n7. \n\n \n\n \n8. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14     65 \n\n(vii)  Conducting complementary consultations for further elaboration of the Tonle Sap \n\nfisheries management plan; \n\n(viii)  Drafting a 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries management plan (including guidelines for \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\ncommunity fisheries management and a code of conduct); \nOrganizing  group  discussions  on  the  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  at \nlocal, provincial, and national levels with representative stakeholders; and \nFinalizing  the  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  and  transmitting  it  to  the \nTSBR Secretariat. \n\n \n\n4. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n9. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $634,000, comprising a foreign exchange cost of \n$396,000  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $238,000  equivalent.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB  to  finance  $540,000  equivalent,  including  the  entire  foreign exchange cost and $144,000 \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto  $94,000,  largely  providing  office  accommodation  and  remuneration  and  per  diem  of \ncounterpart staff, as laid out in the cost estimates and financing plan for the TA. \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n10. \nThe  TA  will  require  about  19  person-months  of  international  and  about  41  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  expertise  with  legal  and  management  experience  in  the  fisheries  sector, \nparticularly inland fisheries.2 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \nwill be appointed by direct selection to deliver the services required.3 The TA will be managed \nas a collaborative exercise by ADB and FAO following the long-standing working arrangements \nbetween  them.4  The  methodology  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA  are  specific  and  clearly \nidentified. Hence, ADB's procedures for simplified technical proposals will be used as the basis \nfor contract negotiation. In the event that it is necessary to engage experts outside of FAO, the \nexperts  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. To facilitate \nimplementation,  DOF  will  provide  logistical  support  to  FAO,  including  adequately  furnished \noffice  space  and  access  to  communications  facilities. DOF will also provide copies of relevant \nlaws, regulations, policies, reports, and other documents. FAO's team will be based in Phnom \nPenh, but will be expected to travel to the five project provinces, particularly during stakeholder \nconsultations. The Executing Agency for the TA will be DOF. \n \nDOF  will  establish  a  Tonle  Sap  Fisheries  Management  Task  Force  headed  by  the \n11. \ndirector  of  DOF  and  comprising  representatives  of  MAFF; \nthe  Community  Fisheries \nDevelopment Office in DOF; the Policy, Strategy, and Networking Division to be strengthened in \nthe  TSBR  Secretariat;  the  offices  of  fisheries  in  the  five  project  provinces\u2014Battambang, \nKompong  Chhnang,  Kompong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap;  and  the  Legal  Committee  in \n\n                                                 \n2  The  team  will  comprise  international  and  domestic  fisheries  experts  with  experience  in  fisheries  law,  fisheries \n\nmanagement, fisheries biology, resource planning and inland fisheries, community organization, and training. \n\n3  FAO is well qualified to undertake the tasks required. Its Legal Office has considerable experience in giving legal \nadvisory services.  These  services  include  assistance  to  prepare  laws,  regulations,  agreements, and other legal \ntexts;  advice  on  institutional  structures  and  compliance  with  international  law;  and  capacity  building  through \nparticipatory  training  of  national  officials.  Its  Fisheries  Department  has  considerable  experience  in  promoting \nefficient, sustainable, and responsible fisheries . \n\n4  The main elements of these working arrangements are described in a Memorandum of Understanding between \n\nADB and FAO appended to Doc. R77-81 (4 August 1981). \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nMAFF. The experts will report to the Task Force and seek its guidance. The Task Force will play \na  key  role  in  organizing  the  technical  consultations,  legal  validation  consultations,  and  the \nenvisaged provincial workshops. Members of the Task Force are expected to be the core group \nof persons who will benefit from on-the-job training under the TA. At the end of the TA, the Task \nForce  will  continue  to  meet  regularly  to  monitor  fisheries  management,  advise  on  the \nimplementation  of  legal  instruments  and  various  elements  of  the  Tonle  Sap  fisheries \nmanagement plan, and prepare 5-yearly updates of the plan. \n \nThe TA will be implemented over 12 months from January 2003. FAO will produce (i) an \n12. \ninception  report  within  4  weeks  of  the  commencement  of  the  TA;  (ii)  a  draft  regulatory \nframework  report  and  a  draft  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  report  16  weeks  after \ncommencement; (iii) a final regulatory framework report and a Tonle Sap fisheries management \nplan  report  1  year  after  commencement;  and  (iv)  an  assignment  completion  report,  outlining \nprogress and any steps to be taken at the end of the TA. On its part, DOF will complete a TA \ncompletion questionnaire to report on the value-added of the TA and describe how it will build \non it. \n \n\n \n\n\fTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign Summary \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \n\n \n\nGoal \nSustainable management and \nconservation of natural \nresources and biodiversity in \nthe Tonle Sap Basin \nObjective  \nTo improve the regulatory and \nmanagement framework for \ninland fisheries  \n\nOutputs  \nA regulatory framework is \ndeveloped. \n\n \nTechnical assistance (TA) \nperformance audit report \n\n \n\n \n\n \nProject framework \n \nTA completion report \n \nTA completion questionnaire \n \nProject framework \n \nProject reports  \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n67 \n\n \nThe Government is committed \nto reforming the regulatory \nand management framework \nfor inland fisheries. \n\n \nKey Department of Fisheries \n(DOF) personnel are actively \ninvolved. \n \nNational and provincial \nofficials are willing and able to \ncollaborate. \n \nDOF submits draft legislation \npromptly for legislative \nprocessing. \n \nEffective cooperation is \nestablished with the \nCommunity Fisheries \nDevelopment Office, and the \nPolicy, Strategy, and \nNetworking Division in the \nTonle Sap Biosphere Reserve \n(TSBR) Secretariat. \nKey DOF personnel are \nactively involved. \n \nThe Tonle Sap Fisheries \nManagement Taskforce \noperates effectively. \n \nEffective cooperation is \nestablished with the \nCommunity Fisheries \nDevelopment Office, and the \nPolicy, Strategy, and \nNetw orking Division in the \nTSBR Secretariat. \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets  \n\n \nRegulatory and management \nframework for inland fisheries \nis in place, functioning, and \nregularly reviewed. \n\n \n\nA regulatory framework is \ndeveloped. \n \nA 5-year Tonle Sap fisheries \nmanagement plan is prepared. \n \nThe existing and draft \nregulatory framework for the \nmanagement of inland \nfisheries are assessed. \n \nA process and consultative \napproach to regulatory \nframework reform is \ndeveloped. \n \nAmendments to the regulatory \nf ramework are proposed after \nconsultations with \nstakeholders. \n\nExisting fisheries \nmanagement systems are \nassessed and constraints and \nopportunities are identified. \n \nStakeholders are consulted \nand their role and interest are \nidentified. \n \nA policy framework for \nfisheries management is \nproposed. \n \nA policy framework and \ntechnical guidelines for \nfisheries community \nmanagement are proposed. \n \nA Tonle Sap fisheries \nmanagement plan is \nproposed. \n \n \n \n \nTotal of 19 person-months of \ninternational expertise: \n??Fisheries legal expert and \n\nteam leader (5) \n??Fisheries management \n\nspecialist (5) \n\n??Fisheries biologist (3) \n\nActivities \nA regulatory framework is \ndeveloped. \n \nOrganize a legal validation \nconsultation to provide \nguidance for planning and \nlegal work \n \nPrepare a report articulating a \ntime frame for review of \nexisting laws and stakeholder \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \nProject framework \n \nProject reports  \n \nWorkshop and technical \nconsultation findings \n\n \n\n \n \n \nThe Tonle Sap Fisheries \nManagement Task Force is \nestablished in DOF. \n \nDOF ensures effective \nstakeholder representation \nand participation in the \nconsultative process. \n\nA 5-year fisheries \nmanagement plan for the \nTonle Sap is prepared. \n\nProject framework \n \nProject reports  \n \nFinal report submitted to and \nreviewed by DOF and other \nGovernment agencies  \n\n\fDesign Summary \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nconsultative process. \n \nRecruitment of experts is not \ndelayed. \n \nAppointment of counterpart \nstaff is not delayed. \n \nCounterpart staffs are \nassigned on a full-time basis. \n \nThe team leader effectively \nmanages team members and \ncoordinates activities. \n \nActivities are carried out on a \ncollaborative basis. \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets  \n\n??Resource planning and \n\ninland fisheries specialist \n(3) \n\n??Community organization \n\nspecialist (3) \n\n \nTotal of 41 person-months of \ndomestic expertise: \n??

The  experts  will  work  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Department  of  Fisheries  (DOF). \nEmphasis  will  be  given  to  hands-on  training  of  counterparts  to  ensure  that  the  skills  imparted \nare  put  to  productive  use.  The  activities  will  be  phased  and  coordinated  in  a  manner  that  will \nallow,  to  the  extent  possible,  simultaneous  presence  of  the  experts  in  the  field,  adequate \npreparation of the key activities, and maintenance of momentum in delivery of the TA. \n \nThe TA will be implemented in two phases over 12 months. In the first phase (6 months), \n2. \nthe  experts  will:  (i)  identify,  review,  and  evaluate  all  relevant  available  data  and  information \nrelating  to  the  Tonle  Sap\u2019s  fisheries;  (ii)  set  out  a  timeframe  for  the  review  of  draft  laws  and \nsubsidiary  legislation,  in  particular  the  draft  subdecree  on  community  fisheries  management; \nand  (iii)  organize  preliminary  stakeholder  consultation.  The  second  phase  (6  months)  will \ninvolve:  (i)  preparation  and  review  of  a  draft  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  and  legal \ntexts through a consultative process including further stakeholder participation; (ii) submission of \na  final  draft  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan  and  legal  texts  to  relevant  government \nauthorities;  and  (iii)  preparation,  review,  and  submission  of  systems  for  public  access  and \ndissemination of legal information. \n \nB. \n \n\nActivities \n\n1. \n\nInitial Activities \n\n \n3. \nThe  experts  will:  (i)  compile,  review,  and  evaluate  existing  documentation  and \ninformation  on  past  and  current  fisheries  management  frameworks  and  practices,  especially \nwith respect to access conditions, fishing regulations, monitoring, compliance and enforcement, \nnational  and  sectoral  policies  and  priorities,  taking  into  account  all  sectors  relevant  to  the \nmanagement  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  regional  development  trends,  community  organization, \nlivelihoods  and  other  socioeconomic  aspects  relevant  to  the  management  of  the  Tonle  Sap's \nfisheries; the effectiveness of  current fisheries laws and regulations (including draft laws) in (a) \nthe  formulation  and  implementation  of  national  fisheries  policies  (b)  the  management, \ndevelopment,  and  regulation  of  the  fisheries  sector,  particularly  the  inland  fisheries  sector;  (c) \ncommunity-based fisheries management;  (d) monitoring, compliance, and enforcement; and (e) \nother  relevant  matters;  (ii)  set  out  a  time  frame  for  the  review  of  draft  laws  and  subsidiary \nlegislation,  in  particular  the  draft  subdecree  on  community  fisheries  management;  and  (iii) \nfacilitate preliminary stakeholder consultation. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving the Regulatory Framework \n\n \n4. \nIn  the  first  phase  of  developing  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  the \nexperts will facilitate: (i) consultative processes that will review the management of commercial, \ncommunity, and other important fisheries in the Tonle Sap; (ii) prepare an inception report that \nwill  (a)  set  out  the  scope  of  the  existing  regulatory  framework,  challenges,  and  opportunities, \nand  (b)  present  a  time  frame  for  the  review  of  draft  laws,  subdecrees,  proclamations,  and \ndirectives or circulars related to inland fisheries, in particular a draft subdecree or amendment to \nany  subdecree  on  community  fisheries  management.  Commentaries  at  the  legal  consultative \nand  training  forum  will  be  used  to  refine  the  approach  to  improving  the  regulatory  framework. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n71 \n\nThe first phase will culminate in the interim report describing preliminary findings and presenting \nrecommendations  for  revisions  considered  necessary  in  the  work  plan.  The  preliminary \nrecommendations  will  include  draft  laws,  decrees  or  amendments  to  laws,  and  subsidiary \nlegislation) to be presented at a legal consultative and training forum. \n \n5. \nThe second phase will involve (i) further consultations culminating in a legal consultative \nand training forum where the draft fisheries law or subsidiary legislation as amended after the \nfirst consultative process will be presented; (ii) follow-up activities including production of a final \nreport  setting  out  draft  final  fisheries  legal  texts  with  necessary  subsidiary  legislation,  and \nsubmission of final legal texts to relevant authorities; (iii) a draft regulatory framework report and \na  final  regulatory  framework  report;  and  (iv)  consolidation  of  consultation  and  training,  and \ndevelopment of public access and information systems to increase legislative awareness and to \nfacilitate enforcement. \n \n\n3. \n\nImproving the Management Framework \n\n \nThe  initial  activities  in  developing  a  5-year  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan \n6. \n(inclusive  of  community  fisheries  documentation)  will  include:  (i)  establishment  of  a  Tonle  Sap \nFisheries  Management  Task  Force  in  DOF;  (ii)  review  and  evaluation  of  documentation  and \ninformation  on  (a)  fisheries  resources;  (b)  past  and  current  fisheries  management frameworks \nand  practices,  especially  with  respect  to  access  conditions,  fishing  regulations,  monitoring, \ncompliance  and  enforcement;  (c)  national  and  sectoral  policies  and  priorities,  taking  into \naccount  all  sectors  relevant  to  the  management  of  the  Tonle  Sap;  (d)  development  trends, \ncommunity  organization,  livelihood  systems,  and  other  socioeconomic  aspects  relevant  to  the \nmanagement  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  fisheries;  (iii)  the  conduct  of  a  consultative  process  on \ncommunity \nlot  management  mechanisms;  and  (iv) \nfishing \npreparation  of  a  draft  diagnosis  and  validation  of  the  draft  diagnosis  through  consultation  and \nfieldwork as appropriate. \n \n7. \nThe  second  phase  will  involve  the  following  activities  (i)  organization  of  group \ndiscussions  of  the  draft  diagnosis  and  plan  principles  with  representative  stakeholders  (to  be \nundertaken  at  provincial  level);  (ii)  complementary  consultation  as  required  for  further \nelaboration  of  the  plan;  (iii)  finalization  of  a  draft  Tonle  Sap  fisheries  management  plan;  (iv) \norganization of group discussions on the Tonle Sap fisheries management plan at the provincial \nand  national  levels  with  representative  stakeholders;  and  (v)  finalization  of  the  Tonle  Sap \nfisheries  management  plan  in  DOF  and  transmission  to  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve \nSecretariat. \n\nfisheries  management  and \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY1 \n\n \nAbout 36% of Cambodia's 11.4 million people2 lived below the poverty line in 1997.3 The \n1. \n1998  census  revealed  that  the  five  project  provinces  of  Battambang,  Kompong  Chhnang, \nKompong Thom, Pursat, and Siem Reap have the highest incidence of poverty (38%); about 2.9 \nmillion  people  live  there  (Table  A15.1),  of  whom  more  than  1.2  million  people  (250,000 \nhouseholds) live in the area bordered by Highways No. 5 and No. 6.4 \n\nTable A15.1: Population of the Tonle Sap \n\nProvince \n\nCambodia \n  Battambang \n  Kompong Chhnang \n  Kompong Thom  \n  Pursat \n  Siem Reap \n \n\nTonle Sap Total \n\nPopulation \n\n11,437,656 \n793,129 \n417,693 \n569,060 \n360,445 \n696,164 \n2,836,491 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMen \n\n5,511,408 \n388,599 \n197,691 \n272,844 \n172,890 \n336,685 \n1,368,709 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWomen \n\n5,926,268 \n404,530 \n220,002 \n296,216 \n187,555 \n359,479 \n1,467,782 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: General Population Census of Cambodia, 1998. \n \nPoverty  Profile.  The  socioeconomic  problems  affecting  the  five  project  provinces  are \n2. \ncommon to most, if not all, rural areas in central and northern Cambodia. They fall into seven \nmain categories: (i) inadequate food and water and low productivity; (ii) poor health services and \nhealth status;5 (iii) low-quality shelter; (iv) low education and lack of training; (v) poor access; (vi) \nlack  of  savings  and  capital;  and  (vii)  lack  of  technology  and  access  to  extension  and  training. \nHowever, the five provinces show some of the lowest poverty indicators (Table A15.2). \n\nTable A15.2: Poverty Indicators of the Tonle Sap \n(%) \n\nIndicator \n\nBattambang \n\nPursat \n\nSiem Reap \n\nKompong \nChhnang \n\nKompong \nThom \n\nHouseholds with female \n\nheads  \n\nPrimary education not \n\ncompleted \n\nAccess to piped water \n\n(rural) \n\nAccess to electricity (rural) \n\nCooking with wood (rural) \n\nMigration within province \n\n21.7 \n\n68.8 \n\n3.7 \n\n0.0 \n\n97.4 \n\n26.8 \n\n69.9 \n\n0.8 \n\n2.0 \n\n96.7 \n\n28.8 \n\n70.7 \n\n1.7 \n\n0.4 \n\n96.4 \n\n24.2 \n\n68.3 \n\n2.9 \n\n9.6 \n\n95.4 \n\n27.6 \n\n73.2 \n\n0.6 \n\n3.0 \n\n97.2 \n\n70.0 \n\n78.5 \nSource: General Population Census of Cambodia, 1998. \n                                                 \n1  See also ADB. 2000. Cambodia: Enabling a Socioeconomic Renaissance. Manila. \n2  The  last  official  census,  conducted  in  1962,  estimated  Cambodia's  population  at  5.7  million.  At  current  rates,  the \n\n76.0 \n\n82.0 \n\n82.7 \n\npopulation will rise to around 14 million by 2005. \n\n3  A  consumption-based  absolute  poverty  line  for  Cambodia  has  been  defined as adequate income to buy a daily \n2,100-calorie  food  basket  plus  a  small  allowance  for  nonfood  expenditure.  This  is  measured  at  KR54,050  per \ncapita per month, or about $0.45 a day, well below the World Bank's $1 a day measure of extreme poverty. \n\n4  It also has the second highest average population density (52 persons per square kilometer). \n5  Abdominal  diseases  prevail  and  deepen  poverty  owing  to  increased  health  care  expenditures  and  related \n\nindebtedness as well as missed opportunities for earning income. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n73 \n\nVulnerable Groups.

Many  demobilized  soldiers \nalso  seek  to  reintegrate  in  the  communities.

There  is  a  strong  correlation \nbetween  sound  natural  resource  management  and  poverty  reduction.  The  plight  of  the  poor, \nincluding vulnerable groups, can be improved by widening their access to natural resources and \ndoing  so  is  critical  to  improve  living  standards  in  the  Tonle  Sap  region.  Conversely,  sound \nmanagement of natural resources is required for sustainable development. In the last 20 years, \ntransactions  involving  the  Tonle  Sap's  natural  resources,  especially  its  fisheries,  have  been \ncharacterized  by  inequity,  fraud,  widespread  corruption,  environmental  degradation  from \nunsustainable patterns of exploitation, and escalating conflict. Predictably, the livelihoods of the \npoor  have  become  more  precarious.  Under  the  Project,  measures  to  strengthen  natural \nresource  management  coordination  and  planning  will  help  to  maintain  the  base  on  which  the \ntarget  population,  including  the  poor,  depends;  measures to organize communities for natural \nresource management will assist communities to improve livelihood systems; and measures to \nbuild  management  capacity  for  biodiversity  conservation  will  help  to  retain  the  many  benefits \nprovided by the Tonle Sap's natural resources (Table A15.4). Enhancing management systems \nand  building  capacity  will  achieve  the  improvements  desired.  The  design  of  the  Project \nincorporates three specific strategies to involve the poor and vulnerable groups and give them a \nvoice: \n\n(i) \n\nParticipation. Participation increases the sense of ownership and commitment \nto interventions and there is a correlation between its breadth and the stability of \nthe  partnerships  and  institutions  formed.  Project  activities  to  strengthen  natural \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nresource management coordination and planning will include raising stakeholder \nawareness  of  the  Tonle  Sap's  environmental  importance  through  a  national \nenvironmental  education  and  awareness  campaign;  and  improving  regulation \nand  management  planning,  specifically \nthe  regulatory  and  management \nframework for inland fisheries, in consultation with stakeholders at the provincial \nand local levels. Inputs from consultations will be integrated in the common policy \nobjectives  formulated  to  underpin  sustainable  management  and  conservation of \nnatural resources and biodiversity in the Tonle Sap. Project activities to organize \ncommunities  for  natural  resource  management  will  be  founded  on  participation: \ndevolved  natural  resource  management  will  reflect  substance  and  show  a \ngenuine shift in authority to local people. Measures will include prioritizing target \ncommunities  by  their  expression  of  interest,  commitment,  the  extent  of \nenvironmental  degradation,  and  occurrence  of  conflict;  activating  commune \ncouncils  and  appropriate  village-level  structures  for  community-based  natural \nresource  management;  mapping  the  boundaries  of  community  fisheries  and \nforestry areas, using orthophotomaps, through a participatory process facilitated \nby  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  and  encouraging  communities  to \nformulate  plans  for  managing  natural  resources.  These  measures  will  be \nundertaken after the most suitable approach to community organization has been \ntailored.  To  build  management  capacity  for  biodiversity  conservation,  measures \nwill include developing alternative livelihoods in the core areas, both for migrants \nand permanent inhabitants, and developing and implementing an environmental \nawareness, education, and outreach program. \nGender. No project is gender-neutral and all can adopt gender-inclusive design \nfeatures  that  integrate  gender  and  development  concerns.  In  the  five  project \nprovinces, nearly 20% of household heads are women. (In Siem Reap, it is about \n30%.)6  Project  activities \nfor  natural  resource \nmanagement  will  include  measures  facilitating  the  full  participation  of  women  in \ndecision  making  by  (a)  gender  sensitization,  (b)  inclusion  of  up  to  40%  women \nmembers  at  various  levels  in  community  organizations  depending  on  specific \nsituations  and  needs,  and  (c)  building  the  capacity  of  women\u2019s  subgroups  at \nvillage  level  for  effective  participation  in  community  organizations,  at  times \ndetermined by women to suit their requirements. \nEthnic  minorities.  In  Cambodia,  inland  fisheries  have  a  sensitive  ethnic \ndimension.  The  stake  of  the  Vietnamese  and  Cham  minorities  has  to  be \nconsidered  when  designing  management  options  that  involve  partnerships  with \nresource  users.  To  strengthen  coordination  and  planning  for  natural  resource \nmanagement,  measures  to  improve  regulation  and  management  planning, \nspecifically  the  regulatory  and  management  framework  for  inland  fisheries,  will \nexamine  the  issue  of  the  rights  of  Vietnamese  communities  in  the  five  project \nprovinces,  whose  livelihoods  depend  on  the  Tonle  Sap.  Project  activities  to \norganize communities for natural resource management will include measures to \ngive  the  Vietnamese  and  Cham  communities  in  the  five  provinces  opportunities \nto participate in community organizations. Through commune councils, commune \nchiefs,  Government  staff  trained  in  participatory  approaches,  and  NGOs,  these \nmeasures  will  attempt  to  build  relations  of  trust  between  the  Khmers  and  the \nVietnamese minority. The Project's impact on ethnic minorities will be observed \nduring project monitoring and evaluation. \n\nto  organize  communities \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n                                                 \n6  See also ADB. 2001.

Poverty  is  pervasive  and  the  poor  depend  on  natural  resources  for  subsistence.  The  Government  has \nrecognized the need to engage communities in natural resource management. Provided management systems and \ncapacity  for  natural  resource  management  are  built  at  national,  provincial,  and  community  levels,  the  sector  can \ncontribute substantially to poverty reduction. \n \nB. \n \nProposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nPoverty  around  the  Tonle  Sap  is  widespread.  About  50%  of  villages  have  40\u201360%  of  households  living  below  the \npoverty  line.  Poverty  is  related  to  lack  of  space  for  local  people  to  participate  and  benefit.  Households  with  female \nheads, households headed by widows, and ethnic minorities are particularly poor and disadvantaged. \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared: \nStakeholders  number  millions.  They  include  local  people,  ethnic  minorities,  local  governments,  as  well  as \nGovernment  agencies  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries.  The  roles  and  responsibilities  of \nstakeholders have been analyzed and delineated. \nParticipation Strategy: \nThe participation strategy aims to involve the poor and vulnerable groups and to give them a voice.

The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity,  1992  defines  biological  diversity \nas  the  variability  among  living  organisms  from  all  sources  including,  among  others,  terrestrial, \nmarine, and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; the \nterm includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. \n \nBiosphere reserves. Areas of terrestrial and coastal or marine ecosystems, or a combination \nthereof, that are recognized internationally within the framework of the Man and the Biosphere \nProgramme of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). \nBiosphere reserves are nominated by national governments and remain under their jurisdiction. \nThe  reserves  must  meet  a  minimal  set  of  criteria  and  adhere  to  a  minimal  set  of  conditions \nbefore  being  admitted  to  UNESCO's  World  Network  of  Biosphere  Reserves.  Each  reserve  is \nintended  to  fulfill  three  complementary  functions:  (i)  a  conservation  function  (preserve \nlandscapes,  ecosystems,  species,  and  genetic  variation);  (ii)  a  development  function  (foster \nsustainable  economic  and  human  development);  and  (iii)  a  logistic  function  (support \ndemonstration  projects,  environmental  education  and  training,  and  research  and  monitoring \nrelated  to  local,  national,  and  global  issues  of  conservation  and  sustainable  development). \nBiosphere  reserves  contain  one  or  more  core  areas,  which  are  securely  protected  sites;  a \nclearly identified buffer zone; and a flexible transition area. \n \nUNESCO. 2002.

A zone that usually surrounds or adjoins core areas, and is used for cooperative \nactivities  compatible  with  sound  ecological  practices,  including  environmental  education, \nrecreation,  ecotourism,  and  applied  and  basic  research.  In  the  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve \n(TSBR), the buffer zone\u2014an area of about 540,000 hectares (ha)\u2014surrounds the core areas up \nto the outer limit of the flooded forest. \n \nCommunity  management.  The  community-based  management  of  local  natural  resources, \nincluding certain designated fishing areas, with support from relevant authorities, and institutions \nand organizations. \n \nCore areas. Securely protected sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed \necosystems,  and  undertaking  nondestructive  research  and  other  low-impact  uses  such  as \neducation.  In  the  TSBR,  the  core  areas  are  located  in  Prek  Toal  (21,342  ha),  Battambang; \nBoeng Tonle Chhmar (Moat Kla) (14,560 ha), Kompong Thom; and Stung Sen (6,355 ha). The \ncore areas are characterized by a preserved flooded forest, rich river systems, and biodiversity. \nNearly  100  water  bird  species  are  found  there,  a  dozen  of  which  are  of  international \nsignificance.  In  addition  to  fish  stocks,  the  areas  are  known  for  species  such  as  crocodiles, \nturtles, macaques, capped langurs, otters, and water snakes. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n"]}
