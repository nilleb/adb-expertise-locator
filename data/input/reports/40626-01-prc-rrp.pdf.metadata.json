To  overcome  this  problem,  the  existing  road  infrastructure  must  be \nimproved  and  upgraded.  The  proposed  project  will  be  the  last  in  a  series  of  five  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) interventions to develop the National Expressway Network Plan (NENP) \nin Yunnan.3 It will also finance the rehabilitation of national and provincial highways, and introduce \nnew ways of maintaining rural roads. The project was included in the country partnership strategy, \n2008\u20132010  and  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  regional  cooperation  operations  business \nplan, 2010\u20132012.4 It is designed to address both investment needs and sector performance issues, \nincluding road asset management.  \n \nYunnan  is  a  mountainous  landlocked  province  in  southwestern  PRC  with  a  population  of \n3. \n45.3 million. In 2008, its per capita gross domestic product was 55% of the national average; and it \nranked  third  lowest  among  the  country\u2019s  administrative  areas.  Because  of  its  remoteness, \ninvestment  and  expansion  of  nonfarm  employment  opportunities  have  lagged  other  provinces. \nRural  poverty  incidence  is  15.2%.  The  lack  of  an  efficient  and  effective  transport  system  is  an \nobstacle to inclusive growth in Yunnan.  \n \nRoad  is  the  most  widely  used  transport  mode  in  Yunnan, 5  and  is  therefore  a  central \n4. \nenabling factor in economic development and reduction of poverty. The total road network reached \n203,753  kilometers  (km)  in  2008,  of  which  less  than  4%  were  class  II  or  above  (compared  with \n10.7% nationally), 5% were class III, and the remaining 91% were class IV and unclassified. High \nclass tolled highways of class I and above (1% of the network) are managed by Yunnan Provincial \nHighway  Development  and  Investment  Company  (YHIC).  The  remainder  of  the  core  network \n(12%)6 is  managed  by  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Highway  Bureau  (YPHB).  The  rural  road  network \n(87%) is managed at the local level by prefectural and county communication bureaus (CCBs). \n \n5. \nNeed  to  expand  road  network  capacity  and  quality.  In  accordance  with  the  State \nCouncil\u2019s NENP approved in 2004, Yunnan is committed to improving its expressway network. One \nsection remains to be built to complete the NENP in western Yunnan and to realize the full benefit \nof  the  sections  already  financed  by  ADB.  This  is  the  Longling\u2013Ruili  Expressway  (LRE),7 the  final \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the list \nof  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  The  Problem  Tree  of  the  Project  is  accessible  from  the  following  weblink: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Concept-Papers/PRC/40626-01-prc-cp.pdf. \n\n3  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n4  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Regional \n\nCooperation Operations Business Plan: Greater Mekong Subregion, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n\n5  The  2008  modal  share  for  passenger-kilometers  (km)  was  66.3%  for  roads,  16.2%  for  railways,  0.3%  for  inland \nwaterways, and 17.2% for aviation. The modal share for freight ton-km was 57.8% for roads, 41.4% for railways, and \n0.8% for inland waterways. \n\n6  The  core  road  network  refers  to  the  non-tolled  ordinary  national  and  provincial  highways,  which  carry  most  of  the \n\ntraffic in Yunnan. \n\n7  This project will link the western part of Yunnan province with Kunming and then Hangzhou (2,500 km in total). It will \n\nalso link with other GMS countries through the GMS Northern Corridor. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsection  of  the  Hangrui  (Hangzhou\u2013Ruili)  corridor,  one  of  the  key  east\u2013west  corridors  connecting \nthe  PRC\u2019s  lagging  regions  with  its  more  prosperous  eastern  and  coastal  provinces.  The  existing \nLongling\u2013Ruili highway (G320), which passes through some hilly and mountainous terrain, carried \nan average traffic volume of 8,530 passenger car units (pcu) per day in 2008. The traffic volume \nvaries  along  this  highway\u2014from  above  14,600  pcu  per  day  around  Mangshi,  where  traffic \ncongestion is growing and the highway is likely to reach capacity by 2012, to about 5,000 pcu per \nday  west  of  Ruili.  The  poor  technical  standard  of  the  existing  highway  limits  the  average  travel \nspeed to less than 40 km per hour, which cannot meet the rising transport demand and leads to a \nhigh  incidence  of  road  accidents.  The  LRE  will  complement  two  successfully  completed  ADB-\nfinanced  projects 8  that  implemented  adjacent  sections  of  the  Hangrui  road  corridor.  When \ncompleted,  it  will  reduce  travel  time  and  transport  costs  considerably,  help  ease  congestion, \nreduce traffic accidents, provide increased opportunities for profitable farm and nonfarm economic \nactivities  along  the  project  road,  and  allow  more  efficient  vehicle  running  speeds  that  will  reduce \ntraffic-induced air pollution in the project corridor. The LRE is critical to reducing income disparities \nand achieving more balanced growth between the western and coastal regions. \n \n6. \nNeed  to  sustain  road  assets.  As  in  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  funding  of  maintenance  for \ntolled highways is generally adequate. However, there have been funding shortfalls for non-tolled \nroads. In the past, the budgets for secondary and tertiary road networks were insufficient to meet \ntheir  maintenance  requirements  and  the  maintenance  backlog  increased  steadily,  reflected  in  a \ngrowing share of roads measured to be in poor or very poor condition. \n \nThe  national  fuel  taxation  reform  has  been  applied  in  Yunnan  since  1  January  2009.9 Six \n7. \nlocal  fees  levied  were  abolished.  Tolls  on  new  class  II  roads  are  no  longer  allowed,  and  tolls  on \nexisting class II roads are being phased out. In their place, the central government has introduced \na  national  fuel  surcharge  of  CNY0.8  per  liter  for  diesel  and  CNY1.0  per  liter  for  gasoline  since \n2009. As the central government collects the fuel tax, there is a need to establish mechanisms and \ndistribution channels for allocating these tax revenues to different users within the transport sector \nat the provincial level\u2014to ensure that funding is available for maintenance of the road network and \ndebt servicing for class II roads. Through ongoing small-scale technical assistance (TA),10 ADB is \nassisting the government to improve the PRC\u2019s road financing and distribution system after the fuel \ntax reform. \n \nIn  Yunnan,  much  remains  to  be  done  to  address  limitations  in  the  approach  to \n8. \nmaintenance. A pavement condition assessment carried out in 2009 of most of the 23,473 km non-\ntolled core network administered by YPHB found that only 35% of roads are in good-to-excellent \ncondition, which is low even for western provinces. As much as 31% of the assessed network was \nfound  to  be  in  very  poor  condition. 11  This  reflects  a  backlog  in  the  financing  of  periodic \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation.  On  average,  only  16%  of  the  estimated  annual  required \nrehabilitation is carried out and little periodic maintenance is performed. This lack of funding arises \npartly because the core road network is deteriorating faster than foreseen due to overloading and \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Manila.  \n\n9  This will bring the pricing system for roads closer to a pay-as-you-go mechanism. The additional fuel tax revenues are \nbeing  used  in  part  to  maintain  and  manage  roads  and  waterways.  It  is  an  efficient  mechanism  to  collect  road  user \nfees, and provides an incentive to lower fuel consumption and promote vehicle fuel efficiency.  \n\n10  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Financing  Road  Construction  and \n\nMaintenance after Fuel Tax Reform. Manila. \n\n11  Areas  with  degraded  roads  (with  average  speed  of  10\u201320  km  per  hour)  also  produce  large  amounts  of  dust  in \n\nYunnan\u2019s dry climate, resulting in significant environmental and health risks for people living near the roads. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nsubstandard  road  design  and  construction. 12  In  addition,  there  are  problems  of  insufficient \nmaintenance budget allocation by Yunnan Provincial Department of Transport (YPDOT) and over-\nexpenditure  on  establishment  and  overhead  costs  (less  than  50%  of  the  budget  is  spent  on \nmaintenance works), although funding is expected to improve significantly over the next few years \nas a result of expected increases of 10% per annum in maintenance funding from YPDOT,13 most \nof which will go directly to maintenance implementation. There are also limitations in the approach \nto  the  planning  and  prioritization  of maintenance  works,  and  inefficient execution  of  maintenance \nworks results in high costs, especially for routine maintenance.  \n \nNeed  to  improve  accessibility  to  remote  poor  areas. About 94% of the province\u2019s land \n9. \narea is covered by mountains and hills. This poses a great obstacle to providing basic rural road \naccess,  particularly  in  the  province\u2019s  western  region.  Rural  roads  account  for  87%  of  the  total \nnetwork,  of  which  county  roads  comprise  22%,  township  roads  56%,  village  roads  19%,  and \nspecial  roads  3%.  Over  98%  are  class  IV  or  unclassified.  The  majority  (81%)  are  unpaved,  with \n40% being gravel roads and 41% being earthen roads. Some 8% have cobblestone paving and the \nremaining 11% have asphalt or concrete pavement. At present, the condition of rural roads is poor, \nespecially unpaved township and village roads. In Dehong, the main prefecture benefiting from the \nproposed LRE, only 40% of county roads, 27% of township roads, and 19% of village roads are in \ngood condition.  \n \n10. \nThe government is committed to meeting the basic access needs of the poor. As a result of \nthe  rural  road  maintenance  reform  policy  that  was  approved  by  the  State  Council  in  2005,  the \nCCBs are entitled to receive a subsidy based on the length of their rural road network (CNY7,000 \nper km for county roads, CNY3,500 per km for township roads, and CNY1,000 per km for village \nroads). However, the subsidy levels are insufficient for roads in mountainous areas, and the actual \nsubsidy payment has often been less than the prescribed level. Moreover, a reliable system is not \nin  place  for  implementation  of  rural  road  maintenance,  especially  for  routine  maintenance  and \nminor repairs of low-volume unpaved roads, which make up a large part of the rural road network.  \n \nFor  township  and  village  roads,  routine  maintenance  is  carried  out  by  local  people  on  a \n11. \nvoluntary basis once a year, with households from the communities concerned contributing a few \nworkdays annually. This system is unreliable and has not significantly improved road conditions. Its \nvoluntary  nature  results  in  low  productivity  and  motivation  and,  often,  required  maintenance \nactivities  are  not  carried  out  in  a  timely  manner,  as  labor  input  is  provided  based  on  availability \nrather than need. Furthermore, the technical skills of the maintenance workers are limited, resulting \nin poor quality works.  \n \nFor  the  low-volume  unpaved  rural  roads,  a  more  effective  community-based  maintenance \n12. \nsystem  needs  to  be  introduced,  including  (i)  payment  of  remuneration  to  ensure  timely  input  of \nlabor, (ii) training for community members who can act as supervisors, and (iii) provision of tools \nand safety equipment. This is being pilot tested in Dehong prefecture with a $200,000 grant from \nADB\u2019s  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund  (GDCF),  and  will  be  replicated  in  the \ncommunity-based  rural  road  output  of  the  project.  This  output  will  focus  on  the  maintenance  of \n650 km of township roads in Dehong (half the township road network) for a period of 4 years. It has \npotential  for  wider  replication  as it will  introduce  a  practical  means  of  implementing  cost-effective \nand  efficient  maintenance  while  the  labor-intensive  maintenance  approach  will  generate  local \nemployment  opportunities  for  the  poor,  including  women,  which  will  contribute  to  poverty \n\n                                                 \n12  Most  of  the  damaged  sections  were  designed  between  1930  and  1970  when  heavy  axleloads  were  rare.  Pavement \ndesign continues to be based on road class instead of on traffic volume and load, even though many of the roads are \ncarrying much higher traffic than intended for the respective road class. \n\n13 Figure  2  of  the  Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Transport  and  ICT  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nalleviation.  The  capacity  of  CCBs  and  maintenance  groups  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure \nsustainability. \n \n13. \nLessons.  The  project  design  benefited  from  lessons  identified  in  ADB\u2019s  2008  sector \nassistance program evaluation of ADB assistance for roads and railways in the PRC,14 as well as \nfrom the lessons from four prior ADB-financed road projects in Yunnan.15 YPDOT has experience \nas  executing  agency  for  implementing  four  ADB-funded  road  projects.  Out  of  the  four,  one  was \nrated highly satisfactory; one was satisfactory; one was recently completed (not yet rated); and one \nis  under  implementation.  Lessons  learned  from  previous  projects  were  reflected  in  the  project \ndesign  by  (i) undertaking  careful  review  of  technical  designs,  traffic  projections,  economic  and \nfinancial  analyses;  (ii)  providing  guidance  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  on  ADB \npolicies,  guidelines,  and  procedures  on  environmental  protection, \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  procurement;  and  (iii)  introducing  an  appropriate  project  performance  and \nmonitoring system at the project design phase. \n \nB. \n \nBy  supporting  comprehensive  improvement  on  the  road  transport  system  in  Yunnan,  the \n14. \nimpact  of  the  project  will  be  sustainable  economic  and  social  development  in  Yunnan  Province. \nThe project outcome will be an efficient, safe, sustainable, and environment-friendly road transport \nsystem developed in the developed in the project area. \n \nC. \n \n15. \n \nOutput  1:  Constructed  new  Longling\u2013Ruili  highway  corridor.  The  project  will  expand \n16. \nthe road capacity in western Yunnan by constructing a new 135 km, four-lane, access controlled \nLRE and a new 23 km of class II highway from Ruili to Nongdao16 with a design speed of 80 km \nper  hour.  The  output  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,649  million,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $228 million. \nThe output will be managed by YHIC through LongRui Expressway Company (LREC). \n \nOutput  2:  Improved  local  road  network  conditions  in  Yunnan.17 This  will  reduce  the \n17. \nmaintenance  backlog,  resulting  in  large  benefits  at  relatively  low  cost.  A  total  of  605  km  of  local \nroads 18 will be rehabilitated and improved in nine prefectures and cities (Chuxiong, Dali, Dehong, \nand  Honghe  prefectures;  Baoshan,  Kunming,  Lijiang,  Lincang,  and  Qujing  cities).  These  roads \nwere  selected  based  on  pavement  condition,  with  priority  given  to  sections  in  poor  to  very  poor \ncondition. By prioritizing rehabilitation and maintenance through this output, ADB will contribute to \nprovince-wide  improvement  in  road  asset  management.  Traffic  safety  facilities,  maintenance \nplanning, and management practices will also be improved. The output is estimated to cost $100 \nmillion, of which ADB will finance $20 million.

Following \nsuccessful  GDCF  pilot  testing,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  small-scale  TA  to \nenhance the project benefits to the poor, especially to poor women from ethnic minorities living in \nthe border area.  \n \n27. \nSmall-scale  TA  of  $200,000  will  be  provided  to  support  community-based  rural  road \nmaintenance.  This  will  be  matched  by  a  government  counterpart  in  kind  contribution  of  $40,000. \nThe TA will finance on-the-job training, safety equipment and supplies, and consulting services. It \nwill have two outputs: (i) rural road maintenance capacity building and skill enhancement programs \nfor the poor, vulnerable groups, and ethnic minorities; and (ii) preparation of a strategy and action \nplan for gender mainstreaming and support for livelihood opportunities. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Other Sources). Details of the \nterms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements are in the \nsmall-scale TA.23 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \n28. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  by  comparing  scenarios  with  and \nwithout the project. The estimated economic benefits are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs as a \nresult of reduced road length, and improved traffic24 and road conditions; (ii) time savings for road \nusers; (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents; and (iv) savings in carbon \n\n                                                 \n23  Small-Scale Technical Assistance on Community-Based Rural Road Maintenance by Women Ethnic Minority Groups \n\nin Western Yunnan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n24  Summary Traffic Analysis is provided in Appendix 2 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ndioxide emissions. The project is economically viable. The economic internal rate of return is 15% \nfor the LRE, and 52% for the rehabilitation and maintenance output. Sensitivity analysis confirms \nthe robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability.  \n \n29. \nThe  financial  analysis  measured  the  LRE\u2019s  ability  to  generate  sufficient  revenues  from \noperations to meet all costs, and achieve a reasonable rate of return. The weighted average cost \nof  capital,  based  on  project  funding  assumptions,  is  compared  with  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  to  ascertain  the  financial  viability  of  the  project.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  after \nincome  tax  is  4.7%,  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  3.0%.  The  project  is \nfinancially  viable.  The  fiscal  impact  of  counterpart  funding  for  implementation  of  nonrevenue-\nearning  outputs  will  be  insignificant  compared  with  total  provincial  and  local  fiscal  revenues.  The \ngovernment is taking steps to provide additional funds for maintenance of local and rural roads.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of the \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (2000,  as  amended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement \ndocument and contracts.  \n \n31. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  of  the \nPRC and YPG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM.  \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  project  will  benefit  about  9.7  million  people,  of  whom  70%  are  rural  residents.  The \nproject  has  nine  distinct  locations,  including  nine  prefectures  and  23  counties  and  districts.  The \nProject will reduce average travel time by at least 40%. It will also reduce vehicle operating costs \nby 38%. The Project will (i) stimulate sustainable economic and social development, promote trade \nand  tourism  development;  (ii)  ensure  the  connecting  parts  of  the  transport  network  operate \nefficiently,  which  will  benefit  both  rural  and  urban  people  in  nine  prefectures  across  Yunnan \nprovince;  and  (iii)  provide  remote  villages  with  improved  access  to  schools,  health  care  services, \nand markets. The labor-intensive approach to maintenance will create employment opportunities, \nbenefitting  local  people  in  Dehong  prefecture,  especially  women,  among  the  poor  and  ethnic \nminorities living in the border area. \n \nRural  poverty  incidence  is  15.2%  in  Yunnan. 25  The  project  will  contribute  to  poverty \n33. \nreduction in the project area through (i) immediate job opportunities created through project-related \nworks, especially for the unskilled and poor (the project will create an extra 5.5 million work days, \nwith  an  additional  remuneration  of  at  least  $47  million);  and  (ii)   improved  access  to  education, \nextension  services,  healthcare,  rural  credit,  and  other  government  social  development  programs. \nThe project will accelerate socioeconomic development through higher land values, construction of \nnew houses, and other new businesses and jobs. By providing rural people with access to higher \npriced markets for agricultural products and reducing the costs of inputs, there will be incentives for \nagricultural  processing  activities  and  other  high-value  crops  (such  as  flowers,  tropical  fruits, \nvegetables, sugar cane, rubber, and tea) in the project area\u2019s rural townships and villages. \n \nGender.  In  January  2010,  ADB  approved  a  grant26 in  the  amount  of  $200,000  for  piloting \n34. \nsupport  for  community-based  rural  road  maintenance,  which  targets  poor  women  and  ethnic \n\n                                                 \n25  Using the PRC poverty line of CNY1,196 per capita per year; that is well below the international poverty line of $1.25 \n\nper person per day (in 2005 purchasing power parity and measured in terms of consumption). \n\n26  This was financed under ADB. 2003.

The objectives of the pilot project are to (i) improve the road access of selected ethnic \nminority villages in Dehong Prefecture, (ii) establish and strengthen women\u2019s groups for rural road \nmaintenance,  and  (iii)  provide  technical  and  entrepreneurship  skills  to  women\u2019s  rural  road \nmaintenance  groups.  It  will  facilitate  economic  and  social  empowerment  of  poor  women  by \nproviding  access  to  financial  resources  from  maintenance  activities,  and  capacity  building  in \nhousehold  livelihood  development.  The  Project  will  result  in  integrating  gender  into  the  routine \nmaintenance provision in Yunnan Province and has potential to replicate the approach in GMS. A \ngender  action  plan 27  and  two  knowledge  products 28  have  been  prepared  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation.  \n \n35. \nHIV and AIDS. Recognizing the potential social risk that the road construction may cause in \nthe project areas, a comprehensive HIV and AIDS Prevention Plan (HAPP)29 has been prepared as \npart  of  the  road  project  design.  The  HAPP  will  consolidate  and  scale  up  good  practices  gained \nfrom previous investments in Yunnan and Guangxi, and in the GMS. An additional $200,000 grant \nwas provided to implement the HAPP.30 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  environmental  category  A.  A  consolidated \n36. \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)31 was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  PRC  regulatory \nframework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The EIA summarized the findings of a \ndomestic EIA for the LRE, an environmental assessment and review framework for other outputs, \nand a due diligence assessment of the environmental impact of the project. The EIA, including an \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the  project,  which  was  discussed  and  endorsed  by \nYPDOT, was circulated to ADB Board of Directors and made public through the ADB website on 7 \nMay  2010.  The  EIA  requires  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing  CNY146 \nmillion. To ensure that all the potential adverse environmental impacts of the project are mitigated, \nYPDOT  will  implement  the  EMP  as  specified  in  the  EIA.  The  EMP  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nbidding  documents  and  contracts  for  civil  works;  they  will  be  monitored  and  semiannual  reports \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n \n37. \nLand  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified \ncategory A for resettlement and for indigenous peoples. YPDOT prepared a resettlement plan32 for \nthe LRE output. Resettlement information booklets have been distributed to affected villages. The \nproject  will  affect  35  administrative  villages  of  12  townships  in  Longling  county  of  Baoshan  city, \nLuxi  city  and  Ruili  city  of  Dehong  prefecture.  Some  770  hectares  of  land  will  be  permanently \nacquired  and  74,000  square  meters  of  houses  will  be  demolished.  About  27,500 persons  will  be \naffected  and  the  estimated  resettlement  cost  is  CNY552  million  to  be  financed  by  counterpart \nfinancing.  About  1 million  people  are  expected  to  benefit  directly  in  the  LRE  influence  area,  of \nwhich 38% are ethnic minorities. The village and household surveys indicated that ethnic minority \ncommunities  support  the  project.  Some  of  these  ethnic  minorities  could  face  negative  impacts  or \nsocial  risks,  including  through  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  communicable  diseases,  and \nchanges  to traditional culture  and  value  systems.  To  address  these  risks,  a  number  of  mitigation \nand  enhancement  measures  have  been  designed  and  targeted  at  the  most  vulnerable  groups. \n\n                                                 \n27  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n28  A  Guide  for  Communications  Bureaus  and  A  Manual  for  Maintenance  Groups  have  been  prepared  for  Community-\n\nBased Routine Road Maintenance by Women\u2019s Groups. \n\n29  HIV and AIDs Prevention Plan is provided in Appendix 4 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n30  This was financed under ADB. 2006.
