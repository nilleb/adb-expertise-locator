It  is  now  timely  for  the  Government \nto  build  an  enabling  business  environment  for  the  private  sector, \nespecially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which represent \nabout  80%  of  urban  employment  and  contribute  about  30%  to \ngross domestic product. With the rapid growth of Pakistan\u2019s urban \ncenters,  the  significance  of  SMEs  in  absorbing  labor  and \ncontributing  to  growth  will  increase.  Despite  many  efforts  to \npromote SMEs in the past, direct government support has proven \nineffective  to  enhance  competitiveness of the SME sector. There \nis  a  clear  need  for  a  well-articulated  SME  policy  determining  the \nrole  of  government \nthe \ndevelopment of the SME sector, while the private sector should be \nresponsible  for  delivering  services  to  SMEs.  Existing  service \nproviders  in  the  private  and  public  sectors  have  so  far  been \nunable  to  provide  needed  services  to  SMEs  in  a  significant  way \nand  to  upgrade  their  competitiveness.  There  is  a  need  for \ndeveloping service markets since single providers will not be able \nto cater to the diverse needs of SMEs. Similarly, access to formal \nsources  of  finance  is  an  important  constraint  of  SME  growth. \nTraditionally,  SMEs  were  regarded  as  the  clients  of  financial \ninstitutions (FIs) in the public sector. This approach has failed and \nthe  Government  is  now  inclined  to  follow  a  private  sector-led \napproach  to  SME  finance.  However,  the  FI  management\u2019s \ntraditional  reluctance  of  entering  the  SME  market  must  be \novercome  through  establishment  of  pioneering  examples,  which \nwill encourage development of a broader market.  \n \nThe  SME  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP)  aims  at  filling  an \nimportant gap in the strategic agenda of the Government and the \n(ADB),  complementing  ADB\u2019s \nAsian  Development  Bank \ninterventions  in  Pakistan  in  rural  and  microfinance  and  capital \nmarket  development,  and  providing  market-based  access  to \nservices.  The  SME  SDP  builds  on  lessons  learned  from  other \nemerging  markets  and  considers  existing  and  planned \ninterventions  of  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies  to  minimize \noverlap.  The  Government  recently  affirmed  the  important  role  of \nSMEs  and  their  potential  for  economic  growth,  employment,  and \nincome generation in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which \nis  also  supported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World \nBank, and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nObjectives \n\nProgram Loan  \n \n\nCost Estimates \n \n\nFinancing Plan \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\nThe goal of the SDP is to improve SMEs\u2019 contribution to economic \ngrowth,  employment,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  objective  is  to \nimprove  SMEs'  competitiveness.  The  SDP  will  support  (i)  policy \nreforms  to  improve  the  business  climate  with  an  emphasis  on \nleveraging  private  sector  interventions;  (ii)  private  FIs  and \nbusiness  development  services  (BDS)  intermediaries  in  building \nup  capabilities  to  serve  SMEs;  (iii)  market-based  outreach  of  FIs \nthrough  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (PCG)  facility  under  ADB\u2019s \nprivate  sector  operations;  (iv)  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP), \nPakistan\u2019s  central  bank,  in  assuming  the  unambiguous  lender  of \nlast resort function vis-\u00e0-vis SME Bank; and (v) the Government in \ndisengaging from ownership of SME Bank through privatization. \n \nThe  SDP  consists  of  four  parts:  (i)  a  program  loan  supporting \npolicy  reforms,  (ii)  a  project  loan  supporting  participatory  policy \ndevelopment  and  building  institutions  and  markets  for  BDS  and \ncredit  for  SMEs,  (iii)  a  PCG  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations  to  leverage  market-based  credit  to  SMEs,  and  (iv)  a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant for coordination of the SDP. \n \nThe  SDP  supports  three  major  policy  outcomes.  The  first  is  to \nimprove  the  SME  policy  environment  through  (i)  development  of \nan SME policy, (ii) establishment of effective labor protection and \nthe \nlabor \neffectiveness  and  outreach  to  SMEs  of  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Development Authority (SMEDA). The second outcome \nis  to  improve  market-based  SME  access  to  BDS  through  the \nestablishment of a Business Support Fund (BSF) managed by the \nprivate sector. The third outcome is to improve the market-based \naccess  to  and  delivery  of  SME  finance,  which  entails  improving \nthe  regulatory  and  credit  information  infrastructure,  building \nprivate FI capacity for SME finance, and restructuring SME Bank. \n \nThe  costs  of  adjustment  (excluding  the  project  costs)  are \nestimated  at  $279.5  million  over  the  period  FY2004\u20132007, \nreflecting the reform and development efforts of the Government, \ninvestments  of  SMEs \ntheir  competitiveness, \nin  upgrading \ninvestments  of  FIs  in  building  SME  finance  capability,  and  the \nrestructuring and privatization of SME Bank. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  \u00a516,436.52  million  ($152  million \nequivalent) from its ordinary capital resources with a 15-year term \nincluding  a  3-year  grace  period,  and  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  of  the  loan \namount. \n\ninspection  policies,  and \n\n(iii)  enhancement  of \n\n\f \n\n \nTranching \n\nImplementation \nArrangeme nts \n\nProcurement \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\nProject Loan \nComponents \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing Agencies \n\nv\n\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  four  tranches  subject  to  compliance \nwith  agreed  conditions  from  the  date  of  loan  effectiveness  up  to \nthe  loan  closing  date  of  30  June  2007.  The  first  tranche,  in  the \namount  of  \u00a53,244.05  million  equivalent,  will  be  released  upon \neffectiveness  of  the  loan.  The  release  of  an  incentive  tranche  in \nthe  same  amount  is  expected  within  7  months  of  the  release  of \nthe first tranche. The second tranche in the same amount and the \nthird tranche comprising the remaining funds are expected in June \n2005 and December 2006, respectively. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency and will also \nconstitute  the  core  program  management  unit  in  charge  of \nmonitoring  and  program  coordination.  The  Ministry  of  Industries \nand  Production,  SMEDA,  Ministry  of  Labour,  BSF,  SBP,  SME \nBank, and the Ministry of Finance will be implementing agencies. \n \nThe  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of \nitems  produced  in  ADB  member  countries  (except  ineligible \nitems).  \n \nCounterpart funds of the program loan will be used for SME Bank \nrestructuring and SMEDA\u2019s outreach program. \n \nThe  Project  is  structured  into  three  subprojects.  Subproject  1 \nsupports  policy  formulation,  including  SME  policy  and  labor \nprotection  and  inspection  policy.  Subproject  2  supports  market \ndevelopment  for  SME  BDS  through  the  SME  BSF.  Subproject  3 \nincluding \nsupports  market  development \nregulatory  policy  development,  credit  information,  and  capacity \nbuilding for financial Institutions; and SME Bank restructuring. \n \nThe  total  project  costs  are  estimated  at  $28.0  million.  ADB  will \nprovide  a  loan  of  SDR12.501  million  ($18.0  million  equivalent) \nincluding $7.91 million equivalent in foreign exchange and $10.09 \nmillion equivalent in domestic currency. The remainder of the cost \nwill be borne by the Government, SMEs, and FIs through fees and \ncost-sharing arrangements. \n \nADB  will  provide  the  loan  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  for  a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Project has a 5-year \nduration and the closing date is expected to be 30 June 2009. \n \nThese are the same institutions and have the same arrangements \nas for the program loan. \n \n\nfor  SME \n\nfinance, \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nProcurement and \nConsulting Services \n\nPartial Credit  \nGuarantee Facility \n \nObjective \n\nDesign Features \n\nExecuting Agencies \n\nProcurement of goods and services is in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  All  consultants  who  are  to  be \nfinanced  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n \n \n\nThe  objective  of  the  PCG  facility  under  the  SME  SDP  is  twofold: \nfirst,  to  leverage  through  a  market-based  approach  existing \nfinancial resources of the financial system for lending to an SME \nsegment  currently  underserved  by  FIs;  and  second,  to  provide \ncatalytic support for innovative financial products and approaches \nin  new  and  less  familiar  markets.  Once  successfully  tested  with \nparticipating  financial  institutions  (PFIs),  such  products  will  be \nexpanded among a larger number of FIs. The expected outcome \nof  the  PCG  facility  is  a  higher  volume  of  SME  lending  by \ncommercial FIs in Pakistan. \n \nADB  will  share  with  PFIs  the  credit  risk  of  SME  loans. ADB will \nhave  identified  these  PFIs  according  to  the  parameters  of  the \nPCG  facility.  ADB  will  issue  PCGs  to  PFIs   to  guarantee \nrepayment of an agreed portion of a loan portfolio. The PCGs will \nhave  agreed  cover  amounts  and  time  frames  to  be  selected \nfollowing  a  due  diligence  process.  To  underscore  the  market \napproach, the PCG facility will be provided through ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations without counterguarantee of the Government. \n \nThe PCG facility will have an overall limit of $65 million. Sublimits \nper PFI are set at up to $20 million equivalent. Since the product \nis  new  both  in  Pakistan  and  for  ADB,  the  PCG  facility  will \ncommence  operation  with  commercial  FIs  that  have  both  well-\nestablished  underwriting  procedures  of  an  international  standard \nand  experience  in  similar  lending  methodologies  elsewhere, \nbefore expanding to domestic FIs. Once ADB is satisfied with the \ntrack  record  of  the  PFI  and  its  SME  borrowers,  portfolio  targets \nwill  be  revised  to  encourage  PFIs  to  expand  further  to  riskier \nsegments.  Guarantee  limits  with  PFIs  will  be  in  US  dollar  terms \nunder  each  PCG,  but  PFIs  will  extend  loans  to  SMEs  under  the \nPCGs  in  local  currency.  The  PCG  facility  will  be  available  for \nissuance  of  PCGs  to  PFIs  for  5  years  from  the  expected  date  of \nADB approval, until 31 December 2008. \n \nPFIs identified through a due diligence process. \n \n\n\f \n\n \nSafeguard Policies \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \nGrant \n\nSmall and Medium \nEnterprise Sector \nDevelopment Program \nBenefits and Impact \n \nPolicy \n\n \nInstitutional \n\nvii \n\nThe PCG facility is classified as \u201cFinancial Intermediary.\u201d ADB will \nperform due diligence of the PFIs\u2019 policies and practices and their \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies.  Accordingly,  an  environment \nmanagement  system  will  be  established,  which  will  be \ndocumented  in  a  guarantee  administration  memorandum.  This \nmemorandum  will  set  out  the  accountability  of  ADB  departments \nin  the  selection  of  PFIs  and  management  under  the  facility \nconsidering  developmental,  commercial,  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies  and  will  ensure  that  the  guarantee  agreements  require \nPFIs  to  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines,  as  well  as \nto  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \nThe  TA  will  assist \nthe  Government  and  private  sector \nstakeholders  in  the  coordination  of  the  reforms.  The  total  cost  of \nthe  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $315,000.  ADB  will  provide  $250,000 \nequivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  45  months.  An  individual \nconsultant  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. \n \nBDS and financial services directly enhance SME competitiveness \nand productivity, which have a direct and positive impact on SME \nprofitability  and  favorably  impact  job  security  and  employment \ncreation. The private sector BDS providers and the FIs will be able \nto  favorably  respond  to  policy  reforms.  The  SDP  provides  the \nframework for developing a consistent SME policy and provides a \ncritical  linkage  of  reforms  with  knowledge  enhancement  and \nfinancial  resource  flow  to  SMEs.  The  SDP  also  supports  the \ncreation  of  a  level  playing  field  in  the  financial  sector  through \nprivatization  of  SME  Bank  and  termination  of  SBP\u2019s  special \nrelationship  with  SME  Bank  consistent  with  SBP\u2019s  role  of  a \nregulator  and  the  privatization  efforts  under  the  financial sector \nreform program. \n \nThe  SDP  will  support  the  rationalization  and  restructuring  of  two \npublic  sector  institutions,  SMEDA  and  SME  Bank.  SMEDA  will \nfollow  a  business  plan  to  expand  its  outreach  and  policy  support \nto  SMEs,  and  its  management  will  benefit  from  business  rules \nenhancing its accountability. SME Bank will go through substantial \nrationalization  to  reduce  excessive  cost  and  contingent  liabilities \nof its owner, and start building a viable banking business followed \nby its privatization under the SDP. \n \n\nOutreach to Beneficiaries  SMEs  in  the  informal  and  formal  sectors  will  be  beneficiaries. \nAbout 8,000 SMEs will benefit from the operations of the BSF and \nabout 30,000 SMEs will benefit from access to financial services. \n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \nRisks \n\nThe program design makes a number of assumptions with varying \ndegrees  of  risk.  It  is  assumed  that  Pakistan  will  not  suffer  from \nmajor  adverse  geopolitical  changes  affecting  its  external  and \ninternal  stability.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the  Government \nremains strongly committed to the reforms undertaken since 1997 \nsupporting  the  poverty  orientation  of  public  expenditure,  the \npromotion  of  SMEs,  and  financial  sector  reforms.  So  far,  the \nGovernment  has  demonstrated  strong  ownership  and  maintains \nhigh priority for the development of SMEs. \n \nThe  reforms  involve  a  number  of  agencies  in  the  public  and \nprivate  sectors.  The  implementation  risks  have  been  addressed \nthrough  the  establishment  of  strong  oversight,  implementation \ncoordination,  and  governance  provisions  in  the  implementation \nframework.  Reforms  will  be  implemented  through  agencies \nexperienced  with  other  complex  reform  programs,  and  the \nestablishment  of  a  strong  core  program  management  unit  at  the \nMinistry  of  Finance  will  ensure  that  progress  and  implementation \nrisks are properly managed. \n \nCredibility of the reforms in the private sector and society at large \nis  essential.  The  program  design  mitigates  the  risk  through  the \nestablishment  of  task  forces  representing  stakeholders  and \nthrough  awareness  building  and  consultation  mechanisms  in \ndeveloping  policy  and  disseminating  the  content.  Public  sector \ninstitutions  also  bear  a  risk  of  low  public  credibility  and  of \npoliticization.  To  reduce  this  risk,  SMEDA  will  prepare  and \nimplement  business  plans,  which  will  be  shared with the public. \nSME  Bank  will  prepare  and  implement  a  restructuring  plan \nfollowed  by  a  privatization  plan,  which  will  be  shared  with  the \npublic  once  it  is  finalized.  Activities  supporting  public  sector \ninstitutions  and  the  private  sector  under  the  SDP will be subject \nboth  to  scrutiny  by  the  SDP  steering  committee  and  to  regular \nperformance audits, carried out by auditing firms associated with \nrespected international partners. \n \nOverall  program  risks  have  been  lessened  through  utilization  of \nseveral institutions, predominantly in the private sector. The use of \na number of institutions, for example private sector FIs or private \nBDS  providers,  puts  the  program  foundations  on  a  broader  base \nand  thereby  reduces  the  risk  if  an  institution  fails  to  deliver.  The \nProgram  also  adopts  an  approach  of  pilot  testing  before  rollout, \nwhich also effectively reduces the risk of failure. \n\n\f \n\nA. \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and a proposed private sector partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nfacility  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development  Program  (SME  SDP).  The \nreport  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  Coordination  of  the \nSME SDP, and if the Board approves the proposed loans and the PCG facility, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the proposed TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Climate and Regional Competitiveness \n\n2. \nA  good  business  climate  is  essential  for  an  enabling  environment  for  investment  and \ngrowth  and  a  key  factor  for  competitiveness.  A  recent  assessment1  highlighted  Pakistan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  with  other  Asian  countries.  Exposed  to  regional  instability  through  its  conflict \nwith India, and wars in neighboring Afghanistan and in the Middle East; and domestically due to \nfrequent changes in government; Pakistan\u2019s private sector investment stagnated at below 10% \nof gross domestic product (GDP), well below India\u2019s 17% in the 1990s. \n \n3. \nBusinesses are also affected by predatory practices of government officials, especially in \nthe inspection functions and in the contracting of services; by poor enforcement of law; by poor \naccess  to,  and  poor  reliability  and  high  cost  of,  infrastructure  such  as  electricity  and \ntransportation;  and  by  cumbersome  import  and  export  clearance  procedures.  Pakistan\u2019s \ncompetitiveness  is  undermined  by  an  unfavorable  business  climate,  the  combination  of  high \nlabor  costs,  high  capital  intensity  per  worker,  and  low  productivity.  Average  wages  are  about \n50%  higher  than  in  Bangladesh,  average  capital  per  worker  exceeds  Bangladesh\u2019s  by  nearly \n50%,  but  overall  productivity  is  about  the  same  as  in  Bangladesh.  The  1990s  have  proven  a \ndifficult  period,  characterized  by  deteriorating  GDP  growth  and  business  opportunities  and  an \nincreasing incidence of poverty. \n \n4. \nDuring  the  second  half  of  the  1990s,  the  Government  undertook  significant structural \nreforms,  which  have  finally  begun  paying  off.2  Since  FY2002,  economic  conditions  have \nimproved, associated with a rebound in industrial production, exports, and private sector credit. \nEconomic  growth  accelerated  from  3.4%  in  FY2002  to  a  provisional  5.1%  in  FY2003.  After \nyears of stagnation, exports surged in FY2003 by an impressive 21% to $11.0 billion, while the \ntrade  deficit  narrowed  to  about  $1.1  billion.  Fueled  by  increased  remittances  from  abroad,  the \ncurrent account surplus built up to $4.0 billion in FY2003 and gross foreign exchange reserves \nincreased  to  about  $10.7  billion  equivalent  to  12  months  of  import  value,  by  June  2003.  The \nexternal  inflow  of  liquidity  was  largely  reflected  in  the  growth  of  bank  deposits  (18%)  and \nfinancial  investments (30%) over the previous 21 months, especially in government securities. \nThese positive trends provided room for an accommodative monetary policy and the State Bank \nof  Pakistan  (SBP)  substantially  reduced  its  discount  rate  from  14.0%  in  July  2001  to  7.5%  in \nNovember  2002.

Pakistan\u2019s  informal  economy  is  a  significant  contributor  to \ngross  national  income  (estimated  at  37%),  employment,  and  livelihoods.  The  share  of \nPakistan\u2019s informal economy is high compared with large Asian countries such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, and Indonesia, where the informal sector accounts for less than 23% \nof gross national income. This highlights the fact that entrepreneurs face high barriers to entry \nand operation in the formal economy. Although small enterprises may have substantial business \nturnover,  current  legislation  allows  enterprises  employing  10  staff  or  below  to  remain  largely \nunregulated  and  thus  avoid  taxation,  registration,  licensing,  and  supervision  requirements.  A \nsurvey undertaken in 1988 (footnote 3) indicated that about 97% of enterprises operated in the \ninformal sector. Most enterprises are family owned as sole proprietorships and partnerships.  \n \n6. \nEconomic Importance understated. Although no official definition exists, the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Authority (SMEDA) uses the legal requirement for formalizing \na  business  (i.e.,  10  or  more  full  time  staff)  as  the  minimum  threshold  for  defining  a  small  and \nmedium  enterprise  (SME).  Unlike  in  other  developing  countries,  where  thresholds  of  about  5 \nemployees are common, all informal enterprises, irrespective of business volume, are classified \nas  microenterprises,  and  units  employing  between  10  and  100  staff  are  classified  as  SMEs. \nUsing  this  definition  by  SMEDA,  about  80,000  SMEs  and  2.2  million  microenterprises  are \nestimated to exist.3 If an internationally more common definition was applied (for example, units \nemploying  5  or  more  staff),  the  total  number  of  SMEs  could  be  more  than  250,000.  The high \nshare of microenterprises reflects distortions and understates the size and potential of the SME \neconomy, which official statistics estimate at 8% of GDP, while SMEDA estimates it at 30 %.4 \n \n7. \nSignificant  Source  for  Urban  Employment.  Since  independence,  the  share  of  rural \nemployment and the rural sector\u2019s contribution to GDP has seen a falling trend. Currently, the \nrural economy accounts for 47% of employment and contributes 24% to GDP. While Pakistan\u2019s \noverall population grew at an annual 2% in 1991\u20131998, the urban population grew at above 3% \na  year,  outpacing  the  growth  in  rural  Pakistan.  The  nine  largest  cities,  each  of  which  has  a \npopulation  exceeding  0.5  million,  have  grown  at  faster  than  4%  a  year  over  the  last  two \ndecades.  With  growing  urbanization,  the  significance  of  the  private  sector  has  increased  and, \nwith it, the pressure to contain the growing gap between new entrants to the labor market (2.4% \na year) and additional employment generated (1.6% a year). \n \n8. \nSMEDA  estimates  that  enterprises  employing  100  staff  and  below  contribute  78%  to \noverall urban employment, of which those employing 10 staff and below contribute about 60%. \nSME employment in services and in trade is most significant with 40% and 36%, respectively, \nfollowed by manufacturing with 24%, while employment in the smallest units is highest in trade, \nfollowed  by  far  less  significant  employment  in  the  manufacturing  and  services  subsectors. \n\n                                                 \n3  Since no official data for the informal sector exist and enterprise surveys are outdated, SMEDA extrapolated the \nresults of a survey of establishments carried out in 1988. Currently, the Federal Bureau of Statistics is preparing a \ncomprehensive survey, the \u201cEconomic Census,\u201d which will serve as a basis for better information on SMEs. \n\n4  In its new prudential regulations for SME finance issued on 28 October 2003, SBP has defined the upper threshold \nfor SMEs as enterprises employing up to 250 employees and an annual business turnover of up to PRs300 million \n($5  million),  while  having  no  definition  of  a  lower  threshold.  The  upper threshold for employment and the use of \nbusiness turnover are in line with international practice. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nOfficial statistics report SME employment at only 5.8 million. However, the  Labor Force Survey \n(1997\u20131998) estimated that 53% of the work force or 19 million people  are employed in trade, \nservices, and manufacturing, suggesting that official statistics substantially understate the size \nof the urban labor force and its absorption by SMEs.  \n \n9. \nDistribution  by  Sector  and  Region.  Most  SMEs  are  concentrated  in  trade  and \nservices,  accounting  for  about  51%  and  34%  of  them,  respectively,  while  manufacturing \nrepresents only 15% of SMEs. The main manufacturing activities of SMEs in the urban formal \nand  informal  economies  are  textile  production,  food  processing,  metal  production  including \nautomotive  spare  parts  and  electrical  items,  surgical  goods,  sporting  goods,  and  leather \nproduction. Most SMEs are concentrated in the urban agglomerations. The industrial centers of \nFaisalabad,  Gujranwala,  Lahore,  Sheikhupura,  and  Sialkot,  which  were  originally  centers  for \nagricultural  production  and  trade,  are  now  home  to  manufacturing  enterprises  both  for  the \ndomestic and international markets. Some SMEs that originally started in small industry clusters \nhave  become  exporters.  However,  a  recent  survey  of  about  1,000  entrepreneurs  (footnote  1) \nindicates that only 15% of sales are related to exports and 8% of supplies are purchased from \nabroad.  Only  scant  information  on  SMEs  in  the  trade  and  service  subsectors  is  available and \nlittle attention has so far been paid to them because of their small size, presence in the informal \neconomy, and domestic market orientation. However, given their large number and contribution \nto employment, their economic potential is significant. \n \n10. \nobtaining reliable information, these can be broadly characterized as follows: \n \n\nThe  term  SME  covers  highly  heterogeneous  groups  of  enterprises.  Despite  difficulty  in \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nVery  small  enterprises  or  microenterprises typically employ up to  four staff, \nmostly  from  the  same  family.  Activities  include  handicraft,  textile,  shops,  trade, \nand  services,  often  at  the  home  premises  of  the  owners.  Professional, \nmanagerial, marketing, and technical skills are usually limited to producing single \nproducts  or  products  and  services  for  the  daily  needs  of  households.  The \nbusiness is mainly oriented toward generating the necessary income for survival \nof the family and very few have a growth orientation. There is anecdotal evidence \nof a high closure rate of such entities within the first 2 years of starting operation. \nThese  enterprises  usually  work  through  a  network  of  families  and  are  almost \nexclusively in the informal sector.  \n\nSmall  informal  enterprises  typically  employ  from  five  to  nine  staff  and  are \nlargely  family-based, having grown from the micro stage. Business sectors are \nsimilar to those of microenterprises. Professional, managerial, and technical skills \nare  higher  than  in  the  microenterprises,  obtained  mainly  through  on-the-job \nexperience  of  the  owners.  These  units  are  more  growth  oriented,  and  use  a \nsignificant  part  of  their  business  revenues  to  invest  in  expansion.  Business \ngrowth  relies  heavily  on  family  relationships.  Typically,  these  enterprises  lack \naccess to formal credit and support services. They have good growth potential if \nthey are supported by the financial sector and other business services. \n\nSmall  formal  sector  enterprises5  typically  employ  between  10  and  100  staff. \nBased  on  family  management,  these  enterprises  usually  have  well-established \n\n                                                 \n5  International  classifications  often  define  SME  units  from  5  to  50  staff  as  small- and from 50 to 250 as medium -\nsized. Since there are no reliable statistics at the moment on the number of enterprises according to this definition, \nsmall formal sector enterprises are defined in this report as those employing between 10 and 100 staff.  \n\n\f 4\n\nrelationships  with  larger  manufacturing  and  trade  concerns  and  are  growth \noriented. Because of their family roots, a number of enterprises in this group face \nchallenges of leadership and management as the business grows and with it the \ncomplexity of management. Most enterprises in this category draw their financial \nresources  from  retained  earnings,  and  long-standing  supplier  and  buyer \nrelationships.  Since  business  information  and  documentation  is  not  readily \navailable, many enterprises in this group face difficulty in accessing finance from \nfinancial  institutions  (FIs).  This  segment,  which  SMEDA  estimates  at  80,000 \nunits,  has,  however,  significant  growth  potential  if  external  support  for  business \nservices and finance is available.  \n\n \n(iv)  Medium-sized  enterprises  typically  employ  between  100  and  250  staff,  and \nhave  well-established  supplier  and  buyer  relationships  with  small  formal  and \ninformally operating enterprises, as well as with large domestic and international \ncorporate  entities.  Usually,  these  enterprises are in the manufacturing business \nboth  in  the  domestic  and  export  markets.  Although  this  segment  normally  has \nto  maintain \nprofessionally  sophisticated  management, \ncompetitiveness in these markets. This enterprise type is an important source of \nemployment and of linkage between the formal and informal economies. Access \nto finance is normally constrained through the FIs\u2019 still existing focus on large and \ngovernment customers.  \n\nis  a  need \n\nthere \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPolicies and Public Sector Support \n\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  SMEs  for  employment  and  income \n11. \ngeneration and has made the development of SMEs one of four key areas of intervention under \nits  10-year  development  plan  for  2001\u20132011  and  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The \nGovernment  established  SMEDA  in  1998  to  spearhead  the  development  of  SMEs  through  (i) \npolicy advice, (ii) provision and facilitation of services, and (iii) becoming itself a lobbying force \nof  SMEs  with  the  Government.  Initially,  SMEDA  focused  on  the  preparation  of  sector studies \nand dissemination of information for SMEs. Since FY2000, SMEDA has provided direct services \nto  SMEs,  such  as  training  courses  reaching  about  5,000  participants  and  preparation  of \nbusiness  plans  for  about  40  SMEs.  SMEDA  has  also  contributed  to  research  and  has \ncommissioned  surveys  to  study  the  business  climate.  Despite  its  achievements,  SMEDA\u2019s \noutreach  to  SMEs  needs  to  be  strengthened  to  go  beyond  direct  involvement  in  providing \nservices at below market prices. Under the program preparatory technical assistance (PPTA),6 \nSMEDA\u2019s performance was analyzed and a draft business plan was prepared to help SMEDA \nfocus  on  policy  development  and  on  facilitation  of  the  development  of  regional  and  industry \nbusiness clusters. \n \nIn  addition  to  SMEDA,  the  federal  Government  supports  exporting  enterprises  through \n12. \nthe  Export  Promotion  Bureau.  As  a  special  department  under  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  the \nExport  Promotion  Bureau  provides  support  for  marketing,  research,  fairs  and  exhibitions,  and \ntrade delegations, and provides linkages with business membership organizations. The Export \nPromotion  Bureau  has  no  specific  SME  focus.7 Provincial governments have established their \nown business support institutions to develop industrial estates, provide low-cost credit to SMEs, \nand  offer  vocational  training.  However,  the  federal  and  provincial  governments\u2019  initiatives, \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Preparing  the  Small  and  Medium \n\nEnterprise Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n7  Under the Small and Medium Enterprise Trade Enhancement Finance Project  (Loan 1796-PAK), ADB supports the \nMinistry of Commerce in developing a holistic approach to trade facilitation, which includes the needs of SMEs.  \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nmainly in response to perceived market failure, have had limited success in providing services \nto SMEs because of the supply-led approach and the high discretion of officials in the allocation \nof support, which have undermined the credibility of such schemes among the public. \n \n\n4. \n\nRepresentation and Access to Business Services \n\n13. \nBusiness Membership Organizations. SMEs are represented in 29 active chambers of \ncommerce and industry, in 84 national associations for industry and trade, and in provincial and \ncluster business associations. Dominated by the larger members, most chambers represent the \ninterests of the large businesses in their interaction with the Government. The more progressive \nchambers  of  Karachi,  Lahore,  and  Sialkot  provide  training  and  advisory  services  for  quality \nmanagement  and  trade  promotion.  SMEs  have  a  higher  participation  in  the  business \nassociations, which are strongest in manufacturing, followed by services. The trade subsector, a \nmainstay  for  SMEs,  is  poorly  represented  by  the  business  organizations.  A  few  associations, \nincluding  the  All  Pakistan  Textile  Mills  Association  and  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants, \nhave established dedicated training programs; most associations, however, while interested in \ntangible  outputs  of  technical  process  upgrading,  marketing,  and  skills  upgrading,  lack  the \nresources to conduct such programs. \n\n \n14. \nPrivate  Business  Service  Providers.  There  are  a  number  of  business  schools, \ninternational training centers, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which provide training \nin  entrepreneurship.  However,  the  target  audience  for  many  of  these  courses  is  the  well-\neducated,  often  English-speaking  middle  class;  these  courses  are  not  accessible  to  the  vast \nmajority  of  Urdu-speaking  entrepreneurs.  Business  advisory  services  are  available,  but  are \nusually  targeted  more  to  wealthy  individuals  or  large  corporate  entities.  A  survey  conducted \nunder  the  PPTA  highlighted  the  low  awareness  of  the  availability  and  low  usage  of  business \ndevelopment services (BDS) among SMEs. SMEs expressed the need for external support in (i) \nmarketing,  market  research,  and  market  information;  (ii)  technical  quality  management, \nespecially for exporters; (iii) technical processing; and (iv) strategic planning. The survey echoes \ninternational  experience  that  the  needs  for  external  support  are  varied  and  depend  on  the \nbusiness  sector  and  on  the  age  of  the  enterprise.  The  variety  of  needs  is  so  wide  that  it  is \nimpossible for a public service provider to accommodate such demand.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMobilization of Financial Resources \n\n15. \nPrivate FI Domination of Support for SMEs. Pakistan\u2019s banking system consists of 40 \nbanks, most of which are privately owned. Thirty of these banks report lending to SMEs (SME \ndefinition varies by bank), equivalent to about 15% of the banking system\u2019s total loans. Despite \nits mandate to serve SMEs, SME Bank, a development finance institution (DFI), contributes only \n0.5%  of  all  loans  to  SMEs.  About  91%  of  the  current  banking  system\u2019s  lending  to  SMEs  is \ngenerated by private banks (including Habib Bank Limited, which is being privatized), leaving a \nmarginal  9%  of  the  market  to  state-owned  banks.  This  is  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s \npolicy of privatizing the banking system.  \n \nUneven Growth of Commercial Lending to SMEs. Consistent with SBP\u2019s reduction in \n16. \nthe  discount  rate,  the  average  spread  of  the  banks8 decreased  from  8.5%  to  5.7%  during the \nJuly 2001 to June 2003 period, while average lending rates were lowered from 14.5% to 7.6%. \nFollowing  a  2%  increase  during  FY2002,  credit  to  the  private  sector  declined  slightly  by  0.8% \nduring the first 9 months of FY2003 to PRs1,056 billion ($18.3 billion). The largest total lending \n\n                                                 \n8  Defined as the differential between average lending and deposit rates of the banking system.  \n\n\f 6\n\nexposure of banks is to the textile industry (25%) followed by agribusiness (10%), while loans to \ntrade  and  commercial  enterprises,  which  represent  about  50%  of  all  business  establishments, \nrepresented  an  extremely  low  share  of  total  lending  exposure  (3%).  During  the  first  half  of \nFY2003, lending to large corporate clients increased by 7% and to consumer finance by 17.3% \n(although from low levels), while lending to SMEs declined by 4.5%.  \n \n17. \nThis uneven performance in a period of easing monetary policy and high liquidity in the \nmarket  is  partly  explained  by  the  risk-averse  attitude  of  banks,  and  the  rigidity  in  prudential \nregulations  of  SBP,  especially  with  regard  to  lending  limits  and  the  restriction  on  FIs  to lend \nagainst collateral. SBP and the private sector\u2019s credit information bureaus maintain incomplete \ncoverage  of  loan  exposures  for  loans  below  PRs500,000,  which  makes  it  difficult  for  FIs  to \nobtain  the  necessary  credit  information  for  smaller  borrowers.  Also,  the  existing  secured \ntransactions  law  and  the  commercial  court  system  are  ineffective,  thereby  contributing  to  a \nmarket that is not conducive to lending to SMEs. By improving credit information and enabling \nprovision of loans collateralized by movable assets, financing to the SME sector, especially the \ninformal/nonregistered SMEs, could be facilitated and SME access to finance broadened.  \n \n18. \nSME  Finance  Activities.  SMEs,  especially  those  in  the  informal  sector,  are  largely \nfinanced  through  the  private  savings  of  the  owner,  retained  earnings  of  the  enterprise,  and/or \nfamily and friends. Access to finance from other informal sources is insignificant. According to a \nrecent  survey  of  approximately  1,000  SME  manufacturers  (footnote  1),  only  1%  of  those \nsurveyed borrowed money from formal sources for working capital purposes. Other sources of \nfinancing, such as trade credit, amounted to less than 5% of those surveyed. Utilization of credit \nfrom  FIs  by  manufacturers  employing  fewer  than  100  employees  is  only  7%.  In  general,  the \nlending  policies  of  banks  tend  to  favor  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  although  the  majority  of \nSMEs are in trade and services, overall formal credit to trade and services is insignificant.  \n \n19. \nCredit  Access  Limited  at  All  SME  Levels.  Despite  the  large  number  (1.7  million)  of \nvery small enterprises employing fewer than five employees, total lending by the formal sector \nto  this  segment  is  negligible.  Even  for  the  250,000  SMEs  with  five  or  more  employees,  it  is \nestimated that less than 5% have access to formal credit.9 Recent surveys10 indicate somewhat \nbetter  access  to  credit  for  the  medium  SME  manufacturers,  although  still  only  about  13%  of \nmanufacturing  SMEs  with  more  than  100  employees  reported  access  to  formal  financing for \nworking capital, and 24% reported access to investment capital. Access improves gradually with \nfirm size, although the majority of SMEs with business turnover below PRs300 million and 250 \nemployees appear underserved. Loan accounts up to PRs100 million account for less than 10% \nof total banking loan exposure. Many surveys confirm that from an entrepreneur\u2019s perspective, \nlack  of  access  to  and  cost  of  bank  financing  are  significant  impediments  to  growth.  All  this \nsignals that there is significant market potential and likely demand for FIs to lend to SMEs at all \nlevels, including for the trade and service sectors and for financing working capital. \n \nB. \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nBusiness Climate and Small and Medium Enterprise Policy \n\n20. \nAlthough  SMEs  constitute  the  mainstay  of  the  urban  economy,  industrial  and  trade \npolicies and laws have favored larger businesses; smaller units are particularly affected by the \npoor  business  climate.  Many  laws,  regulations,  and  practices  developed  prior  to  Pakistan\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n9  Information from banks confirms that lending up to PRs5 million is insignificant, with only about 10,000 borrowers. \n10 Footnote 1 and the World Bank, Pakistan\u2019s Small Entrepreneur, Gallup World Bank Survey (2001).Unpublished. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nindependence  and  during  a  period  of  interventionist  approaches  to  development  are  now \nredundant.  Written  in  the  English  language,  laws  and  most  policies  are  not  accessible  to the \nvast majority of the population. Unprotected and ignorant of their rights and duties, many SMEs \nare  exposed  to  \u201cpredatory\u201d  practices  of  inspectors,  who  are  claiming  fees  for  alleged \nnoncompliance with laws and regulations. \n \n21. \nDespite  the  strategic  importance  of  SMEs  for  economic  activity  in  general,  and \nemployment in particular, the Government has so far not articulated consistent policies for the \nSME  sector  and  has  resorted  to  a  practice  of  ad  hoc  interventions.  A  policy  is  needed  to \nestablish  (i)  the  role  and  accountability  of  the  Government  and  its  agencies  and  the  private \nsector in developing SMEs and (ii) effective interface mechanisms between these organizations. \nIssues  to  be  addressed  in  an  SME  policy  are  diverse,  and  policy  development  and \nimplementation  will  need  to  go  through  a  participatory  process.  The process requires careful \npreparation and implementation under which the following principal issues will be addressed. \n \n22. \nImprovement  in  the  Business  Environment.  An  important  step  is  the  review  of \nlegislation and regulation, which is currently being made through the Deregulation Commission \naiming to simplify laws and administrative procedures.11 Another important step is making laws \nand rules transparent and understood through dissemination in the local language and through \naccess to free basic legal advice.12 \n \n23. \nDefinition of the Role of Private and Public Sector Stakeholders.  This entails (i) the \nidentification of market failure and failure of government institutions to assess the possible need \nand  potential  for  successful  direct  government  intervention;  (ii)  based  on  the  limitations \nidentified under (i), the assignment of accountability to the Government and the private sector in \nshaping  policy,  and  facilitating  development  of  SMEs;  (iii)  responsibilities  at  the  federal, \nprovincial,  and  local  levels;  (iv)  topic-specific  lead  functions  among  government  departments \nand  agencies;  (v)  the  role  of  the  Government  in  facilitating  BDS;  (vi)  the  role  of  the  private \nsector  in  facilitating  and  providing  BDS;  and  (vii)  preparation  of  a  strategic  framework  for \ninstitutional reform of government agencies involved in the support of SMEs. \n \n24. \nClear  Definition  of  SMEs.  This  is  essential  to  determine  the  boundary  for  targeting \npolicy  interventions.  Because  of  the  large  variety  of  institutions,  the  issue  of  formal  and \ninformally operating units must be addressed.  \n \n25. \nDevelopment of Strategy and Institutional Framework.  The strategy would articulate \nthe  government  and  private  sector  contribution  toward  policy  development,  including  an \ninstitutional framework for implementing the policy.  \n \n26. \nDevelopment  of  an  SME  Database  and  Performance  Monitoring  Mechanism. \nReliable  information  on  SMEs  is  unavailable,  as  the  last  comprehensive  survey  of  enterprises \nwas undertaken 15 years ago. The Economic Census currently being prepared by the Ministry \n\n                                                 \n11 The  Deregulation  Commission  is  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Industries  and  Production  and  has  undertaken  the \nreview of the Factories Act (1934), which constitutes the umbrella legislation for many enterprise-related laws. The \nMinistry of Labour has undertaken to simplify labor laws and is consolidating 42 laws into six laws. The World Bank \nis assisting the work of the Deregulation Commission. \n\n12 There  are  other  issues  essential  for  improving  the  business  environment  such  as  the  access  to  public  utilities, \ntransport,  communication,  financial  services,  and  facilitation  of  customs,  which  will  not  be  necessarily  addressed \nunder an SME policy. These issues are being addressed by the Government and international financial institutions \nthrough  sector-specific  programs.  ADB  is  addressing  these  through  its  operations  in  the  power  and  transport \nsectors. \n\n\f 8\n\nof  Economic  Affairs  and  Statistics  provides  an  opportunity  for  an  update  analysis  of  SMEs. \nFurther, an annual update of statistical information could promote a sound basis for assessment \nof developments of the SME sector and for policy decisions. \n \n\n2. \n\nLabor Protection and Inspection \n\n27. \nFeedback  from  the  private  sector,  government  stakeholders,  and  studies  points  to  the \nabuse  of  power  of  tax  and  labor  inspectors,  which  absorbs  significant  entrepreneurial  time. \nConversely, the benefits of maintaining basic labor standards for a good work environment and \nthe consequent positive impact on profitable enterprises are not understood. Current labor laws \nare to a large extent outdated, and reform efforts to simplify laws and inspection procedures are \ncarried out in a policy vacuum. It is therefore necessary to formulate labor protection policies as \nan adequate framework for the development of a labor inspection function to be characterized \nby  least  intervention,  awareness  building  of  employers  and  employees,  development  of  self-\ninspection, and subcontracting arrangements with the private sector. Such policies need to be \ndeveloped in a consultative process with stakeholders, and shared with the public. \n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Sector Support \n\n28. \nSince  its  establishment  in  1998,  SMEDA  has  undergone  major  changes  in  its \norganization to become more responsive to the needs of SMEs. Although SMEDA has gained \npermanent  status  as  an  authority  by  virtue  of an ordinance, the ordinance provides excessive \npowers  and  discretion  to  the  board,  unless  executive  powers  are  delegated  to  the  chief \nexecutive  officer  through  business  rules  and  performance  benchmarks.  In  addition,  SMEDA\u2019s \npolicy advisory role needs to  be firmed up in providing active support in the development of the \nSME policy. Direct interventions in SME training and in the preparation of business plans have \nproduced  quality  outputs  but  have  been  constrained  by  limited  outreach.  While  SMEDA  has \nmade  a  commendable  contribution  to  making  laws  and  regulations,  and  sector  studies  and \nreviews  available  to  an  English-speaking  audience,  these  outputs  will  need  to  be  made \navailable in the local language to ensure a broader outreach.13 SMEDA has established some \nconnections  with  regional  and  industry  SME  clusters,  for  example  to  upgrade  processing  and \nproduct  quality  in  the  textile  sector.  It  is  now  timely  that  SMEDA  moves  to  medium-term \nplanning and monitoring of its activities with a focus on outreach to SMEs through facilitation. \n \n\n4. \n\nMarket Access to Knowledge-Based Services  \n\nPakistan  provides  public  sector  support  to  manufacturing  and  exporting  enterprises. \n29. \nHowever, hands-on business support to SMEs is rare. Located in the public sector, institutions \nare constrained by the lack of strategic direction, exposure to government directives, and lack of \nbusiness expertise. A number of private sector service providers focus on legal matters, tax and \naudit,  and  management  consulting.  There  are  an  estimated  30,000  legal  advisers  and  476 \nchartered accountants, among whom 11% provide management consulting services. Also, there \nare a number of private sector providers in the education sector in response to the often limited \nservice outreach and quality provided  by the public sector. Clearly, service providers are highly \nfragmented and have not yet identified SMEs as their clientele. As these services in the public \nsector  are  not  demand  driven  and  lack  professionalism,  there  is  a  large  unmet  demand  for \nmarket-based services for SMEs.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Access  to  Justice  Program .  Manila.  (under  Loans  1897-PAK  and  1898-PAK, \napproved on 20 December 2001 for $330 million, the Government committed to issue a simplified Urdu version of \nany new law). \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThe  PPTA  identified  needs  in  the  areas  of  practical  and  strategic  business  advice, \n30. \nfinancing,  marketing,  and  technology  upgrading.  Since  SMEs  cover  a  high  diversity  of \nbusinesses  characterized  by  stage  of  development,  sector,  target  market,  and  educational \nbackground,  the  needs  are  highly  diversified.  International  experience  suggests  that  public \nservice  providers  are  ineffective  in  reducing  the  knowledge  gap  though,  and  are  unable  to \nrespond  to  the  variety  of  needs  of  the  market.  On  the  other  hand,  information  asymmetry \nbetween  potential  users  and  providers  of  services  is  an  important  reason  for  the  lack  of \ndeveloped service markets. Since the early 1990s, various government-supported facilities have \nbeen  established  to  support  the  development  of  market-based  services  for  entrepreneurs. \nUnder such schemes, a business support facility provides support to SMEs on a first-come-first-\nserved basis, after satisfactory evidence of the business support case. Such facilities are best \nplaced  and  managed  in  the  private  sector,  with  the  Government  playing  an  important \nsupervisory role. Stakeholder feedback from the private sector obtained during the preparation \nof the SDP clearly identified the need to kick-start development of a BDS industry for SMEs. \n \n\n5. \n\nMarket Access to Finance \n\n31. \nIneffective  Government  Promotion  of  SMEs.  Mismanagement  of  government-owned \nbanks  and  DFIs  brought  Pakistan  to  the  verge  of  a  banking  crisis  in  1996.  Recognizing  the \nfailure  of  interventionist  policies,  the  Government  has  conducted,  since  1997, an aggressive \nreform by strengthening the autonomy and capacity of SBP, privatizing banks, consolidating the \nsector through increased capital requirements, and gradually phasing out DFIs through merger \nwith or  transformation into commercial banks. While the reforms improved the performance of \nthe  FIs,  the  risk-adverse  mind-set  of  the  new  managers  has  led  to  a  standstill  of  lending  to \nsmaller  SMEs.  In  light  of  recent  high  liquidity  in  the  market,  FIs  increasingly  see  the  need  to \ndevelop new markets for SMEs. Among the reasons for the low FI outreach to SMEs are: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nmost SMEs are in the informal economy and not considered creditworthy; \nbased on physical collateral, lending processes and products are not adapted to \nthe characteristics of SMEs; \nSMEs lack physical collateral to pledge as security for loans; and \nFIs  lack  the  requisite  lending  and  risk  management  processes  to  determine  the \ncash-flow generation capacity without documentation. \n\n \n32. \nCredit Information Systems. SBP and FIs also recognize the importance of good credit \ninformation systems for improving the outreach of SME finance. Currently, one public and three \nprivate service providers are established in Pakistan. The coverage of the services, however, is \nhighly fragmented and the public credit information bureaus need to improve data integrity and \ncoverage.  International  experience  shows  that  well-established credit information and registry \nsystems  exist  both  in  the  public  and  private  sectors,  and  that  the  role  of  the  private  sector \ndepends on its willingness to provide full coverage of credit information at reasonable cost even \non the smallest borrowings. There is a need for a strategy of developing credit information and \nregistry systems and linking the public and private systems, enhancing their outreach.  \n \nPrudential  Regulations.  Until  very  recently,  prudential  regulations  required  banks  to \n33. \napply  the  same  criteria  for  lending  to  small  and  large  clients.  \u201cClean  lending\u201d  on  a  cash-flow \nbasis was limited to $1,700 equivalent. There is significant overlap between SME and consumer \nfinance since the goods and services financed can be of use for businesses as well as private \nconsumers.  For  small  enterprises,  the  border  between  the  private  and  business  spheres  is \nusually  blurred.  SBP  therefore  recognized  the  need  to  revise  regulations  for  encouraging  the \nbanks to develop innovative but prudent ways for SME and consumer finance. \n\n\f 10\n\nStimulating the Market for SME Finance. Given the large diversity of financial needs \n34. \nand  degrees  of  sophistication  of  SMEs,  one  approach  alone  will  not  suffice  to  stimulate  the \nmarket. Innovative approaches supporting higher risk taking through proven lending processes \nbased on the cash flow of  the  borrower  are  warranted  to  replace  the  classic  collateral-based \nlending.  Commercial  FIs  need  to  develop  dedicated  SME  finance  capacity  through  a  client-\nfocused  approach  and  lending  process  that  differ  substantially  from  existing  processes  for \ncorporate  and  retail  lending.  Internationally,  a  downscaling  approach  has  been  successfully \ntested to incentivize banks to move down market. This also leads the way for Pakistan\u2019s FIs. \n \n35. \nTraditional  Efforts  and  Lessons  Learned  for  SME  Lending.  Traditional  efforts  to \nimprove credit flow to SMEs often include targeted credit. Experience in Pakistan and elsewhere \nhas shown mixed results, with (i) low utilization of credit lines when channeled through private \nFIs, characterized by a lack of adequate incentives and responsiveness to market change; and \n(ii) high default of credit when channeled through public sector FIs, resulting from inherent moral \nhazard  and  poor  governance.  A  key  lesson  learned  is  that  incentives  matter.  Collateral-based \nlending  is  costly  for  small  loans,  and  there  are  alternatives  with  more  attractive  risk-reward \nstructures.  Hence,  access  to  capital  is  not  merely  an  issue  of  availability  of  funds,  but  of  risk \nmanagement and establishment of appropriate incentives for FIs to lend to SMEs.  \n \n36.  Mobilizing Existing Liquidity in the Market for SME Lending.  A number of capacity-\nbuilding  as  well  as  policy  measures  have  recently  been  initiated,  to  be  supported  under  the \nproposed SME SDP. This includes the development of commercial banks\u2019 capability to extend \ncredit  to  and  manage  risks  of  SMEs,  through  the  buildup  of  dedicated  SME  business  units. \nHowever,  FIs  continue  placing  large  amounts  of  liquidity  in  low-risk  government  bonds  and \ncorporate loans, reflecting an important barrier of their highly risk-averse approach that needs to \nbe overcome through suitable lending processes, and products. \n \n37. \nThe  ADB\u2019s  PCG  instrument\u2014which  in  a  partnership  with  selected  FIs  shares  some  of \nthe risks, and rewards, associated with SME lending\u2014is a suitable vehicle to raise the comfort \nlevel of participating FIs (PFIs) for SME lending, by (i) mitigating the impact on the FIs\u2019 capital \nbase  in  case  of  systemic  risk  occurrence,  (ii)  supporting  increased  flow  of  funds  to  SMEs \nthrough  effective  leveraging  of  the  PFIs\u2019  equity,  (iii)  assisting  PFIs  to  gradually  develop  client \nrelationships  with  smaller  SME  clients,  and  (iv)  introducing  to  Pakistan  international  good \npractice in SME lending processes and products.  \n \n38. \nin  SME  Bank.  The  Government \nestablished  SME  Bank  in  January  2002  through  the  merger  of  two  failed  DFIs.14  SME  Bank \ninherited  all  assets,  liabilities,  staff,  privileges,  and  duties  of  the  precursor  DFIs,  including  a \nnonperforming  loan  portfolio  exceeding  85%  of  outstanding  principal.  SME  bank\u2019s  biggest \nliability,  however,  is  the  more  than  1,000  unqualified  staff  with  permanent  employment  status, \nrepresenting about 90% of total staff strength. Previously, management assigned 900 of these \nto recover the old loan portfolio, which after initial success is now witnessing substantial decline. \nAs more difficult cases are to be resolved, average monthly recovery has dropped to below 60% \nof  its  peak  in  FY2001.  SME  Bank  now  needs  to  rigorously  reduce  unqualified  but highly paid \nstaff,  who  put  increasing  pressure  on  profitability  and  add  to  the  Government\u2019s  contingent \nliabilities. \n \n39. \nThe  SME  Bank\u2019s  new  business  since  January  2002  has  generated  a  high  level  of \nnonperforming loans. Over the past 6 months, the proportion of past dues above 90 days has \n\nDisengaging  from  Government  Ownership \n\n                                                 \n14 The Small Business Finance Corporation and the Regional Development Finance Corporation. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nincreased  from  6%  to  13%  of  the  outstanding  loans,  emphasizing  the  need  for  a  different, \ncommercially oriented approach. Appointment of a head for SME credit is essential since only a \nfew  of  SME  Bank\u2019s  staff  in  the  lending  operations  have  the  requisite  commercial  skills  to \ndevelop the business. SME Bank still enjoys significant privileges with SBP, through a profit and \nloss  sharing  arrangement  and  subsidized  loans  from  SBP,  which  constitute  about  83%  of  the \nbank\u2019s  overall  resources.  This  has  allowed  SME  Bank  to  make  profits  through  investments  in \nhigh-interest  government  bonds.  As  part  of  the  reform  and  restructuring  of  SME  Bank,  the \nGovernment and SBP agreed to terminate the special privileges of SME Bank and to eliminate \nSBP\u2019s shareholding in the bank. The SME Bank is envisaged to be privatized within 3 years. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nOperational lessons learned from Pakistan and numerous emerging markets relevant for \n\n40. \nthe design of the SME SDP include the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nGovernments play a key role as facilitators for market development, while direct \nservice provision should be left to the private sector;  \nRegulatory  support,  and  stimulation  of  market-based BDS, has proven effective \nin promoting economic growth and employment; \nPolicy  development  must  take  place  in  a  consultative  and  participatory  process \ninvolving a wide range of stakeholders to gain credibility;  \nGovernment  provision  of  services  to  SMEs  bears  high  risks  of  missing  targeted \nneeds  and  should  be  strictly  limited  to  interventions,  where  market  failure \nprevents delivery through the private sector;  \nBecause of the diversity of the needs, a large number of services is needed; \nBDS should be demand driven; \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  Subsidies should be terminated when markets and products are established; and \n(viii)  Rigorous  controls  and  business  ethics  must  be  established  to  ensure  good \n\n(iv) \n\ngovernance and public credibility of the schemes. \n\n \n7. \n\nRationale  \n\nThe SME SDP aims at filling an important gap in the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s strategic \n41. \nagenda, and complements ADB\u2019s interventions in rural finance and microfinance and in capital \nmarket  development,  supporting  provision  of  market-based  access  for  the  beneficiaries.  The \nSME SDP builds on lessons learned from other emerging markets and considers existing and \nplanned interventions of ADB and other funding agencies to minimize overlap. SME access to \nphysical  infrastructure  and  trade  facilitation  are  important  areas  supported  under  ADB\u2019s \noperations  in  the  power  and  transport  sectors  and  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Trade \nEnhancement  Finance  Project.  Neither  fiscal  reform,  including  the  inspection  function  for  tax \ninspectors,  nor  the  work  of  the  Deregulation  Commission,  were  included  in  the  scope  of  the \nProgram, since the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank support these areas. The \nGovernment  recently  affirmed  the  important  role  of  SMEs  and  their  potential  for  economic \ngrowth, employment, and income generation in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, which is \nalso  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  and \nthe World Bank.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f 12\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\nImportant Features \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nA. \n \nThe  long-term  goal  of  the  SDP  is  to  improve  the  SME  sector  contribution  to  economic \n42. \ngrowth,  employment,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  objective  of  the  SDP  is  to  improve  SMEs' \ncompetitiveness.  The  SDP  will  support  (i)  the  Government  in  policy  reforms  to  improve  the \nbusiness climate with an emphasis on leveraging private sector interventions, (ii) private FIs and \nBDS  intermediaries  in  building  up  the  requisite  capabilities  to  serve  SMEs,  (iii)  market-based \noutreach  of  financial  intermediaries  through  a  PCG  facility  under  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations,  (iv)  SBP  to  assume  an  unambiguous  lender  of  last  resort  functions  vis-\u00e0-vis SME \nBank,  and  (v)  the  Government  in  disengaging  from  ownership  in  SME  Bank  through \nprivatization after restructuring its insolvent operations. \n \nThe SDP consists of four parts: (i) a program loan supporting policy reforms; (ii) a project \n43. \nloan, \nthree  subprojects  supporting \nthe  SME  Sector  Development  Project  comprising \nparticipatory  policy  development,  and  building  institutions  and  markets  for  BDS  and  SME \nfinance; (iii) a PCG through ADB\u2019s private sector operations to enhance credit to SMEs; and (iv) \na  TA  grant  to  support  implementation  of  the  SDP.  The  program  framework  summarizes  the \ndesign (Appendix 1). The development policy letter and the policy matrix summarize the agreed \npolicy reforms (Appendix 2). \n \nB. \n \nGovernment  Focus  on  Policy  Setting  and  Facilitation. The SDP supports the focus \n44. \nof the Government and its agencies on policy setting, catalytic support, and coordinating efforts \nof the private sector in the SME sector, while refraining from direct intervention in areas where \nservices are and can be provided by the private sector. \n \n45. \nthe \nBuilding  Credibility  Through  Good  Governance.  The  SDP  supports \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  governance  through  enhanced  transparency  of  regulations \nand  their  implementation  in  order  to  reduce  interference  and  possibilities  for  rent  seeking  by \nofficials.  The  SDP  also  supports  the  establishment  of  the  SME  Business  Support  Fund  (BSF) \nmanaged  by  the  private  sector  under  strict  business  ethics,  rules  for  conflict  of  interest,  and \nexternal audit. \n \nBlending ADB Instruments and Adopting Lessons Learned. The Program integrates \n46. \nADB\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  operations  and  mobilizes  domestic  resources  of  the  FIs  to \nfinance  SMEs  through  the  PCG  facility,  thereby  promoting  a  market-based  approach  and \navoiding risks of failures associated with traditional credit-line support. \n \n47. \nPrivatization of SME Bank. The SDP supports (i) containing the fiscal risks associated \nwith  an  insolvent  institution;  (ii)  termination  of  special  lender  of  first  resort  and  shareholding \nrelationship with SBP; and (iii) transfer of the operations to the private sector. \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe Program entails three policy outcomes in six key result areas (KRAs):  \n\n48. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nOutcome 1  \nKRA 1.1  \nKRA 1.2  \nKRA 1.3 \n \nOutcome 2 \n\nKRA 2 \n \nOutcome 3  \nKRA 3.1 \n\nKRA 3.2 \n\n13\n\nImprove SME Policy Environment  \nDevelop SME Policy \nEstablish Effective Labor Protection and Labor Inspection Policies \nEnhance SMEDA\u2019s Effectiveness and Outreach to SMEs \n\nImprove  Market-Based  SME  Access  to  Business  Development \nServices \nEnhance SME Competitiveness Through Private Sector Services \n\nImprove Market-Based Access to and Delivery of SME Finance  \nImprove  Regulatory  and  Credit  Information  Infrastructure  and  Build \nPrivate FI Capacity \nRestructure and Privatize SME Bank  \n\na. \n\nImprove SME Policy Environment \n \n\nDevelop  SME  Policy.  Under  the  SDP,  the  Government  will  establish  a  task  force  to \n49. \ndevelop  in  a  participatory  and  consultative  process  an  SME  policy  framework  paper  and  to \nprovide  the  background  analysis  and  basis  for  its  development.  The  policy  will  cover  (i)  a \nstrategy  and  action  plan,  (ii)  enterprise  size  definition,  (iii)  the  focus  of  government  support \nthrough  policy  reforms  and  targeted  inventions  using  services  from  the  private  sector,  (iv)  the \nrole of  the  private  sector  in  providing  services  and  shaping  SME  policy,  and  (v)  other  priority \nissues identified by the task force. The task force will delegate specific topics to focused policy \nadvisory  groups  facilitated  by  a  government  representative  and  private  sector  representatives \nand will consult with provincial government and consider ongoing reforms at the provincial level \nas  appropriate.  The  results  of  the  advisory  groups  will  be  consolidated  and  prioritized  into  an \noverall draft policy and action plan in a consultative process. The SME policy will be issued by \nthe  Government  and  supplemented  by  an  action  and  resource  plan  for  implementation  during \nthe  second  half  of  the  program  period.  This  includes  the  publication  of  the  first  SME \ndevelopment report in Urdu. \n \n50. \nEstablish Effective Labor Protection and Labor Inspection Policies. To improve the \nunderstanding of the purpose of labor protection and its positive impact on enterprise efficiency, \nand to provide a reasonable benchmark for the approaches and objectives of labor inspection, a \nnational  labor  protection  policy  based  on  core  labor  standards  will  be  developed  in  a \nconsultative  process  with  all  stakeholders.  To  curb  the  abuse  of  power  of  labor  inspectors, a \nnew  labor  inspection  policy  based  on  the  labor  protection  policy  and  characterized  by  least \nintervention  of  the  Government,  awareness  building  of  employers  and  employees,  and \ndevelopment  self-inspection  and  subcontracting  arrangements  with  the  private  sector,  will  be \ndeveloped  once  the  labor  protection  policy  is  in  place.  These  national  policies  will  be \ncommunicated through awareness-building seminars and publications for implementation at the \nprovincial level.15 Subsequent to the issuance of the labor inspection policy, the Government will \nrevise the Factories Act (1934) as necessary to reflect the reforms of the labor protection and \ninspection policies. \n \n51. \nEnhance  SMEDA\u2019s  Effectiveness  and  Outreach  to  SMEs.  The  Government  will \nimprove the governance and business focus of SMEDA through the appointment of a full-time \nprofessional chief executive officer and implementation of a 5-year SMEDA business plan, to be \n\n                                                 \n15 Development of the SME policy and the labor protection and inspection policies will be supported by consultants to \n\nbe hired under Subproject 1 as detailed in Appendix 4. \n\n\f 14\n\napproved by 30 June 2004, according to clearly defined performance benchmarks. To improve \nits outreach to SME clusters, SMEDA will also determine the design of and implement a 5-year \nbusiness  plan  for  developing  shared  facilities  for  SME  clusters  under  common  facility  centers \n(CFCs)  against  clearly  defined  performance  criteria.  To  enhance  its  policy  advisory  role, \nSMEDA will establish a secretariat for the SME policy task force at SMEDA. To clarify the role of \nthe SMEDA management, the SMEDA board will issue business rules to ensure accountability \nof  the  management  team  for  day-to-day operations. The performance of SMEDA and its CFC \nprogram will be supervised by its board and will be subject to independent performance audits. \n \n\nb. \n\nImprove Market-Based SME Access to Business Development \nServices \n\n \nBDS  have  internationally  been  proven  as  a  tool  to  enhance  competitiveness  of \n52. \nenterprises through knowledge transfer and direct application at the enterprise level. To ensure \na demand-led approach for BDS, the Government will establish the SME BSF under Article 42 \nof the Companies Ordinance, 1984. The SME BSF will be accessible for SMEs to meet a large \nvariety  of  knowledge-service  needs  to  enhance  their  productivity  and  competitiveness.  SMEs \nwill submit proposals for accessing the SME BSF, which will be evaluated on a first come, first \nserved  basis.  Services  will  be  customized  by  private  sector  providers  to  meet  the  needs  of \nSMEs and will include the development of business plans, process improvement, identification \nof  markets,  marketing,  and  product  and  service  quality  improvement.  The  SME  BSF  will  be \ncreated by a private sector-led task force appointed by the Government, which will approve the \ndraft  articles  of  association,  the  business  plan  and  standard  operating  procedures;  hire  the \nfacility manager; and coordinate the legal and operational establishment. The SME BSF will be \nsupervised by its board of directors and will be subject to independent performance audits.16 \n \n\nc. \n\nImprove Market-Based Access to and Delivery of SME Finance  \n\n \n\ni. \n\nImprove Regulatory and Credit Information Infrastructure and \nBuild Private Financial Institution Capacity  \n\n \n53. \nImprove Prudential Regulations. While aiming at prudent lending, the SBP prudential \nregulations were largely oriented toward the corporate and wealthy clientele of FIs, undermining \nthe  emergence  of  innovative  and  risk-effective  products  and  processes  for  service  delivery  to \nsmaller  clients.  Under  the  program,  SBP  has  issued  new  regulations  for  SME  and  consumer \nlending  to  stimulate  innovative  services  to  SMEs  and  their  clients,  the  consumers.  SBP  will \nperiodically review the impact of these prudential regulations on the uptake of lending and the \nportfolio quality of the FIs, and revise the regulations as necessary. \n \n54. \nImprove Quality and Outreach of Credit Information Systems. Well-functioning and \nintegrated credit information systems provide essential information to support lending decisions \nof  prospective  creditors.  Currently,  Pakistan  maintains  one  public  and  three  privately  owned \ncredit information systems. SBP intends to strengthen the role of private sector credit bureaus in \nbuilding  the  credit  information  infrastructure.  However,  international  experience  regarding  the \nownership, information sharing, and financing of credit information systems is mixed, warranting \na  thorough  review  of  international  experience  and  domestic  conditions  before  finalizing  a \nstrategy  and  action  plan.  SBP  is  commissioning  a  World  Bank-funded  study,  which  will \ndetermine the strategy and action plan, especially the scope and mix of accountability of private \nand public sector bureaus. Subject to the outcome of the study SBP will, in cooperation with the \n\n                                                 \n16 The BSF operations will be funded and managed through Subproject 2 under this SME SDP. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nprivate sector, develop and implement an action plan for improving the quality and coverage of \nan integrated credit information system. \n \n55. \nBuild  Awareness  of  FIs  and  Support  Capacity  Building  for  SME  Finance. \nInternational experience suggests that innovative lending processes and products utilizing (i) a \ncombination of qualitative and quantitative skills in determining cash flow and creditworthiness \nof  borrowers,  (ii)  specific  sector  knowledge,  or  (iii)  information  from  supplier  and  buyer \nrelationships have successfully resulted in downscaling FI markets from an orientation on large \nand asset-rich customers to the large market for smaller businesses. Under the SDP, SBP will, \nas an independent broker, promote targeted awareness among FIs of SME finance processes \nand  products  through  workshops,  training  on  a  cost-sharing  basis,  and  assistance  to  FIs  that \nhave demonstrated management commitment in building dedicated SME finance capacity. \n \n\nii. \n\nRestructure and Privatize SME Bank \n\n \n56. \nSBP to Terminate Special Lender of First Resort Relationship. SBP is currently the \nprimary lender to and a major shareholder of SME Bank. Under the Program,  SBP, SME Bank, \nand the Government will terminate SME Bank\u2019s special relationship through immediate transfer \nof SBP\u2019s shareholding to the Government and repayment of 57.2% of SBP\u2019s outstanding loans \nto  SME  Bank  within  the  first  year  and  the  remainder  through  repayment  of  21.4%  of  the  SBP \nloans in each of the following years of the program. \n \n57. \nGovernment to Disengage from SME Bank Ownership. Consistent with its approach \nto  financial  system  reform  and  cognizant  of  the  important  role  of  the  private  sector in serving \nSMEs,  the  Government  supports  a  market-based  approach  refraining  from  directed  lending  to \nSMEs. Under the SDP, the Government and SME Bank management prepared a restructuring \nplan aiming at SME Bank\u2019s privatization within the 3-year program period.17 According to SME \nBank\u2019s restructuring plan, the business will be reorganized into two units: an SME business unit \nand  a  distressed  portfolio  recovery  unit.  Additionally,  the  restructuring  plan  includes  (i)  a  time-\nbound  action  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  bank  branches  and  to  rationalize  staff  of  the \nrecovery  unit  to  a  sustainable  cost  level,  and  (ii)  an  independent  human  resource  audit  to:  (a) \nevaluate  the  skills  of  the  employees  at  the  bank;  (b)  identify  and  match  skills  for  specific  jobs \nwithin  the  bank;  (c)  identify  alternative  job  opportunities  for  employees;  and  (d)  provide  active \njob-search assistance and reemployment training for personnel. The restructuring plan entails a \npackage  of  sequenced  operational  and  financial  restructuring  measures   reducing  the  liabilities \nrelated to excessive unqualified staff and an excessive branch infrastructure (Appendix 3). \n \n\n2. \n\nCosts and Financing Plan \n\n58. \nCosts  of  Adjustment.  These  are  illustrated  in  Table  1  and  reflect  costs  for  the \nrestructuring  and  privatization  of  SME  Bank,  investment  costs  of  FIs  in  building  SME  finance \ncapability,  investment  costs  of  SMEs  in  upgrading  their  competitiveness,  and  the  reform  and \ndevelopment  efforts  of  the  Government  and  SMEDA.  The  costs  of  adjustment  reflect  a \nsubstantial  initial  effort  of  SME  Bank  to  downsize  branch  and  regular  staff  to  cut  operational \ncosts of the unprofitable recovery operations, followed by a gradual rationalization of branches \nand  staff.  The  SME  Bank  financial  restructuring  similarly  reflects  an  upfront effort to provision \nthe nonperforming loan portfolio and repay SBP\u2019s loans. The SMEDA costs reflect an expected \n                                                 \n17 Several options were explored in detail including (i) an early liquidation and/or sale of SME Bank, (ii) the transfer of \nthe bad portfolio and staff to an asset recovery agency, and (iii) the creation of legally separate \u201cgood bank\u201d and \n\u201cbad bank\u201d entities. The Government opted for the restructuring of SME Bank followed by privatization because of \nthe political risks involved in a large upfront staff separation scheme. \n\n\f 16\n\ngradual increase of its outreach program to industry clusters. The rest of the costs of adjustment \nreflect  the  FIs\u2019  investment  in  SME  capacity-building  and  lending  programs,  and  SMEs\u2019 \ninvestment  in  innovative  technology,  production,  and  marketing  processes.  The  costs  of \nadjustment under the Program are net of the project costs. \n \n \n\nTable 1: Estimate of Adjustment Costs \n($ million) \n \n\nItem \n\nFY2004 \n\nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nTotal \n\nA.

The Government has requested a loan of \u00a516,436.52 million \n59. \n($152 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the cost of the \nProgram. The loan will have a 15-year term including a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% of the \nloan amount, and other terms and conditions set out in the draft program Loan Agreement. (The \nfront-end fee for loans approved in 2003 has been reduced from 1.0% to 0.5%.) The proceeds \nwill  be  available  for  withdrawal  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  agreed  conditions  from  the \ndate of loan effectiveness up to the loan closing date on  30 June 2007. The first tranche, in the \namount  of  \u00a53,244.05  million,  will  be  released  upon  effectiveness  of  the  loan,  subject  to \ncompliance  with  the  first  tranche  conditions.  The  release  of  an  incentive  tranche  in  the  same \namount is expected within 7 months of compliance with the conditions of the first tranche. The \nsecond tranche in the same amount and the third tranche comprising the remaining funds will \nbe made available upon compliance with agreed conditions and are expected in June 2005 and \nDecember  2006,  respectively.  The  financing  amounts  under  the  Program  are  net  of  amounts \nfinanced under the Project.  \n \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\nProcurement  and  Disbursement.  The  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard \n60. \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement. Proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance \nthe full foreign exchange costs, excluding local duties and taxes, of eligible imports produced in \nand procured from ADB\u2019s member countries. All procurement under the program loan will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and undertaken through normal commercial \npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency. Disbursements under the \nprogram  loan  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2018s  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  audit \nrequirements.  To  withdraw  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  Borrower  will  certify  that  the  value  of \neligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nin  a  given  period.  ADB  will  have  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \n61. \nCounterpart Funds. As part of SME SDP, it has been agreed that the Government will \ncontribute counterpart funds for the SME Bank restructuring and SMEDA\u2019s CFC program. The \nfirst  tranche  amount  will  be  utilized  for  repayment  of  SME  Bank\u2019s  liabilities  to  SBP.  The \nproceeds of the incentive tranche will be used for the further repayment of SME Bank\u2019s liabilities \nto  SBP  and  reimbursement  to  SME  Bank  for  the  expenditures  related  to  staff  separation.  The \nproceeds of the second and third tranches will cover adjustment cost related to SME Bank staff \nseparation  and  include  earmarking  of  up  to  $6  million  equivalent  each  for  SMEDA\u2019s  CFC \nprogram.  The  borrower  will  certify  the  utilization  of  counterpart  funds  in  line  with  the  Loan \nAgreement \nimplementation \narrangements for the program and project loans are under Section E below. \n \nD. \n \n\nthrough  audited  statements  acceptable \n\nto  ADB.  All  other \n\nThe Project \n\n1. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n62. \nThe  SME  Sector  Development  Project  supports  the  implementation  of  policy  reforms \nand the building of a market-based infrastructure for BDS and financial services to SMEs and is \nstructured  in  three  subprojects.  Details  of  the  rationale,  scope,  and  approach  of  each  of  the \nsubprojects are described in Appendixes 4, 5, and 6. The costs and financing are summarized \nin Appendix 7 and implementation arrangements are detailed in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nPolicy Formulation and Implementation \nSME Policy Development \nLabor Protection and Inspection Policy Development \n\nSME Business Support Fund \n\nMarket Development for SME Finance \nRegulatory  Policy  Development,  Credit  Information,  and  Capacity \nBuilding for Financial Institutions \nSME Bank Restructuring \n\n \n\na. \n\nSubproject 1: Policy Formulation and Implementation \n\n \n63. \nThe  purpose  of  the  subproject  is  to  assist  the  Government  to  develop  the  SME  policy \n(Ministry of Industries and Production [MOIP] supported by SMEDA for component 1.1), and the \nLabor  Protection  and  Inspection  Policies  (Ministry  of  Labour  [MOL]  for  component  1.2)  and  to \nestablish  state-of-the-art  processes  for  participatory  preparation  of  the  policies,  topic-specific \npolicy advisory groups involving all stakeholders, and awareness building and dissemination at \nthe provincial and local levels utilizing local language. Project component 1.1 will as well support \nSMEDA in the establishment and analysis of an SME database for annual updating to monitor \npolicy reform impact (Appendix 4). \n \n\nb. \n\nSubproject 2: SME Business Support Fund \n\n \nThe  subproject  will  establish  the  SME  BSF  as  a  company within three months of loan \n64. \neffectiveness,  with  a  nine-member  board  led  by  private  sector  members  and  composed  of  at \nleast six representatives from the private sector. The fund will provide SMEs with direct access \n\nSubproject 1:  \nComponent 1.1: \nComponent 1.2: \n \nSubproject 2:  \n \nSubproject 3:  \nComponent 3.1: \n\nComponent 3.2: \n\n\f 18\n\nto  market-based  knowledge  services  to  enhance  their  productivity  and  competitiveness.  The \nutilization will be demand driven and SMEs will access the funds on a cost-sharing basis after \ntheir  proposals  have  gone  through  scrutiny  by  a  dedicated  facility  management  team.  In \nsupporting  the  SME  applicants,  the  BSF  will  utilize  and  effectively  leverage  the  knowledge \nservices  available  in  the  private  sector  and  thus  stimulate  the  downscaling  of  the  market  for \nbusiness advisory services to the level of SMEs. \n \n65. \nThe design and establishment of  the  SME  BSF  has  utilized  best  practice  in  emerging \nmarkets.  The  legal  and  governance  structure  of  the  SME  BSF  is  modeled  after  the  Poverty \nAlleviation Fund, which is successfully managed under the leadership of the private sector, with \nparticipation  of  NGOs  and  the  Government.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  establish  the \nSME  BSF  based  on  its  own  experience  gained  with  this  model.  Besides  having  sound \nmanagement  experience,  it  is  critical  that  the  management  of  the  SME  BSF  applies  strong \nprofessional  ethics  including  rules  dealing  with  conflict  of  interest,  the  separation  of  business \norigination  and  management,  and  the  external  recruitment  of  an  experienced  facility  manger. \nThese arrangements will not only serve to establish a strong governance environment within the \nBSF,  but  will  also  be  critical  for  the  reputation  of  the  SME  BSF  among  the  public  as  an \naccessible  institution  serving  the  needs  of  the  clients.  Under  the  PPTA,  memorandum  and \narticles  of  association  were  drafted  and  a  business  plan  and  standard  operating  procedures \nprepared and reviewed by MOF (Appendix 5).   \n \n\nc.  Subproject 3: Market Development for SME Finance \u2014Component  3.1 \n\n \n66. \nThe  objective  of  this  subproject  component  is  to  increase  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance \nthrough the private sector. The component focuses on (i) developing a conducive regulatory and \npolicy environment for SME finance, (ii) encouraging FIs to develop SME lending capability, and \n(iii) providing capacity building to PFIs committed to establish SME finance units (Appendix 6).   \n \nDeveloping a Conducive Regulatory and Policy Environment for SME Finance . In \n67. \norder to have a well-functioning financial system for SME lending, regulations, supervision, and \nmonitoring of the FIs must be improved and FIs\u2019 policies and procedures for SME lending must \nbe  introduced.  To  improve  their  ability  in  performing  proper  credit  analysis  on  SMEs,  more \ncomprehensive credit information must be provided to FIs. Additionally, to enhance SME access \nto  credit,  the  legal  framework  for  secured  transactions  will  be  reviewed  and  developed.  A \nbanking regulation and supervision expert with extensive experience in SMEs will assist in the \nreview of SBP\u2019s regulations, supervision, and approach to the SME segment. \n \n68. \nEncouraging  FIs  to  Develop  SME  Lending  Capability.  Commercial  SME  finance  is \nrelatively  new  in  Pakistan.  Capacity  building  on  SME  finance  will  be  offered  to  both  SBP  and \nFIs.  Seminars  and  workshops  will  be  conducted  by  experts  on  the  strategies  and  methods  of \nestablishing  SME  finance  capability  at  the  FIs.  This  entails  market  research,  product \ndevelopment,  lending  processes,  control  systems,  and  capacity  building  of  professional  staff. \nAdvisory support will also be provided to assist FIs in developing SME business strategies. \n \nCustomized  Capacity  Building  of  FIs.  FIs  committed  to  establish  an  SME  financing \n69. \nunit may qualify for consulting services by submitting a business plan for approval to SBP and \nADB. Upon approval of the FI\u2019s business plan, the FI will obtain consulting services on a cost-\nsharing  basis  to  implement  the  business  plan  and  establish  the  SME  finance  capability.  This \nactivity may also prepare FIs for participation in the PCG facility described in Section F. \n \n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nd.  Subproject 3: Market Development for SME Finance\u2014Component 3.2 \n\n \n70. \nThis  component  will  assist  SME  Bank  with  the  implementation  of  its  restructuring  plan, \nand provide expertise to (i) identify market niches for SME Bank, (ii) establish lending policies \nand procedures, (iii) develop financial  products,  (iv)  develop  marketing  strategies  to  enhance \noutreach,  and  (v)  develop  sound  risk  management  through  appropriate  incentives  for  staff, \ncontrols,  and  sound  management  information  systems.  SME  Bank  will  have  an  international \nexpert as head of its new SME business unit, who will assist in building up the commercial SME \nbusiness including the deposit and lending products. A committee composed of representatives \nof SME Bank and core program management unit (CPMU) will select the expert (Appendix 6). \n \n\n2. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n71. \nAmounts and Terms.  The  total  project  costs  are  estimated  at  $28  million  equivalent. \nThe Government has requested a loan of SDR12.501 million ($18 million equivalent) including \n$7.91 equivalent in foreign exchange and $10.09 million equivalent in domestic currency to help \nfinance the Project. The remainder of the cost will be borne by the Government and the private \nsector  SMEs  and  FIs  through  fees  and  cost-sharing  arrangements.  The  project  loan  will  be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, interest rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand other terms and conditions set out in the draft project Loan Agreement. The Project has a 5-\nyear duration and the closing date will be 30 June 2009. The proceeds of the project loan will be \npassed on in the following manner: (i) as a budgetary allocation to MOL ($350,000 equivalent, \nComponent  1.2),  and  MOF  (CPMU)  ($960,000  equivalent);  and  (ii)  as  a  grant  to  SBP \n($8,000,000 equivalent, Component 3.1), SMEDA ($200,000 equivalent, Component 1.1), SME \nBSF ($7,190,000 equivalent, Component 2), and SME Bank ($800,000 equivalent, Component \n3.2). \n\n \nTable 2.

Procurement will be limited to office equipment and a \nvehicle  estimated  at  a  total  of  $71,800  equivalent,  which  will  be  procured  under  direct \nprocurement procedures. All consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nGovernment  requested  that  domestic  consultants  may  be  required  to  collaborate  with \ninternational  consultants.  The  consulting  services  under  component  3.1  require  an  innovative \napproach  to  awareness  building,  and  identification  of  PFIs  and  PFI  senior  management \ncommitment  of  their  SME  finance  business  plans,  before  assistance  packages  can  be \ncustomized. Since there is no standardized approach for delivery of such services and since the \ntasks of developing systems, lending processes, and procedures for SME finance are complex \nand  require  highly  specialized  skills  and  a  significant  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  allocation  of \nexpertise, the quality-based selection method will be applied for the capacity-building portion of \nthis component (Table 3, 3.1b,). Since the participating FIs will be identified in the awareness-\nbuilding  process  through  short-term  consultants,  the  requisite  terms  of  reference  and \nspecialized skills will be customized to the needs of the individual PFI. It is expected that up to \nfour PFIs will benefit from the capacity-building measures. All other consulting positions will be \nadvertised and selected on an individual basis as set out in Table 3.  \n \n\nTable 3.

Monitoring. To monitor implementation of the Program and the Project, the EA through \nthe  CPMU  will  liaise  closely  with  the  IAs,  collect  information  from  the  IAs  and  other  relevant \nsources, and prepare quarterly progress reports as well  as  an  annual  report.  The  CPMU  will \nestablish a performance monitoring system during inception of the Project. Within 3 months of \ncompletion,  the  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  completion  reports  providing  a  detailed \nevaluation  of  the  SDP  design,  costs,  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact, \nand other details as may be requested by ADB. \n \n86. \nAccounting  and  Auditing.  The  EA  and  IAs  will  establish  and  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  the  SDP  components  in  accordance  with  accounting  and  financial management \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Imprest accounts will be established for each of MOF, SBP, and \nSMEDA  as  described  in  Appendix  8.  The  steering  committee  will  commission  financial  and \nperformance  audits  of  the  CPMU  and  IAs  and  their  accounts  in  accordance  with  auditing \nstandards acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements \nand the reports of the auditors will be submitted to ADB in English within 6 months of the end of \neach fiscal year. The CPMU will  ensure that each IA submits reports on a timely basis and will \nconsolidate the reports for transmission to ADB. \n \nF. \n \n\nPartial Credit Guarantee Facility \n\n1. \n\nRationale and Objective \n\nRationale.  As  described  under  Section  II  B5,  \u201cIssues  and  Opportunities,\u201d  the \n87. \nintroduction  of  market-based  products  enhancing  the  channeling  of  existing  liquidity  of  the \nfinancial  system  to  SME  lending  is  a  key  innovation  supported  under  the  SDP.  ADB\u2019s  PCG \nfacility, which in partnership with selected PFIs shares the credit risks and rewards associated \nwith SME lending, will raise the comfort level of PFIs by (i) leveraging the PFIs\u2019 resources, (ii) \nassisting  PFIs  to  develop  client  relationships  with  smaller  SME  clients,  and  (iii)  introducing \ninternational  good  practice  for  SME  lending  to  Pakistan.  The  PCG  facility  will  initially  draw  on \ninternational  FIs  based  in  Pakistan,  which  have  experience  in  SME  lending  in  other  emerging \nmarkets. Once ADB has gained initial experience with the PCG, domestic FIs are expected to \nfollow the international FIs and develop similar methodologies for SME lending.  \n \n88. \nObjective  of  the  PCG  Facility.  The  objective  of  the  PCG  facility  under  the  SDP  is \ntwofold:  first,  to  leverage  through  a  market-based  approach  existing  financial  resources  of  the \nfinancial  system  for  lending  to  an  SME  segment  currently  underserved  by  FIs;  and  second,  to \nprovide  catalytic  support  for  innovative  financial  products  and  approaches  in  new  and  less \nfamiliar markets. Once successfully tested with PFIs, such products will be expanded among a \nlarger  number  of  FIs.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  PCG  facility  is  a  higher  volume  of  SME \nlending by commercial FIs in Pakistan. Details of the PCG facility are in Appendix 9. \n \n\n2. \n\nFacility Design \n\n89. \nStructure.  ADB will share with PFIs,  identified  by  ADB  in  a  due  diligence  process, the \ncredit  risk  of  SME  loans.  ADB  will  issue  PCGs  to  PFIs  to  guarantee  repayment  of  an  agreed \nportion of a loan portfolio.  The  PCGs  will  have  agreed  cover  amounts  and  time  frames  to  be \nselected  following  a  due  diligence  process.  The  PCGs  will  detail  the  risk-  and  reward-sharing \narrangements  for  individual  loans  within  a  defined  portfolio  of  loans  extended  by  the  PFIs  to \nSMEs.  The  loan  portfolio  covered  under  each  PCG  may  be  revolving,  and  the  portfolio \n\n\f 24\n\ncomposition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI as agreed with ADB. \nADB will not be involved in the lending decisions of the PFIs, but will agree with the PFIs on the \nlending selection and risk management process.  To underscore the market approach, the PCG \nfacility  will  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  without  government \ncounterguarantee. Terms and conditions will be market based. \n \n90. \nScope. The PCG facility is proposed to have an overall limit of $65 million. PCGs will be \nissued for each PFI based on demand and prudent practices, starting with lower amounts that \ncan be gradually increased within the overall PCG facility limit. Sublimits will be set at up to $20 \nmillion  equivalent  for  each  PFI.  Risk  sharing  with  PFIs  will  take  place  on  two  levels  on  an \nindividual loan basis. First, a first loss limit will be defined that will be fully absorbed by the PFI. \nThe first loss will be a function of the strength of the financial institution, its past SME lending \nhistory, and its risk management systems. The level of first loss may be fixed between 0% for \nstrong institutions with an established track record up to 30% for new market entrants. Second, \nany loss in excess of the first loss will be shared with the PFI at an agreed rate, normally 50%.  \n \nPrudent Phasing-in and Close Monitoring. Since the product is new both in Pakistan \n91. \nand  for  ADB,  the  PCG  facility  will  commence  operation  with  commercial  FIs  that  have  well-\nestablished  underwriting  procedures  of  an  international  standard  and  experience  in  similar \nlending  methodologies  elsewhere,  before  expanding  to  domestic  FIs.  Likewise,  the  portfolio  of \nguaranteed  loans  will  expand  gradually.  The  tenor  of  guaranteed  loans  will  be  limited  to  36 \nmonths, although initially the PCG will be targeted at shorter maturities. Once ADB is satisfied \nwith  the  track  record  of  the  PFI  and  its  SME  borrowers,  portfolio  targets  may  be  revised  to \nencourage PFIs to expand further to riskier segments. \n \n92. \nGuarantee  limits  with  PFIs  will  be  in  US  dollar  terms  under  each  PCG,  but  PFIs  will \nextend  loans  to  SMEs  under  the  PCGs  in  local  currency.  Any  risk  as  a  result  of  currency \nfluctuations beyond the US dollar PCG limit for each PFI will be for the account of the PFI, since \nADB\u2019s  risk  exposure  will  be  capped  with  the  dollar  amount  to  be  specified  in  the  guarantee \nagreement with each PFI. The PCG facility will be available for issuance of PCGs to PFIs for 5 \nyears from the expected date of ADB approval, until 31 December 2008. \n \nSMEs supported under the facility will be for example suppliers and vendors maintaining \n93. \nbusiness with corporate clients of the PFIs, in industries that have reasonably integrated supply \nchain  structures,  such  as  the  pharmaceutical,  automobile,  engineering,  and  consumer  goods \nindustries. For example, corporate entities in the pharmaceutical industry provide their products \nto about 200 pharmacies in Karachi alone. Many of these pharmacies have an annual business \nturnover  of  about  PRs50  million  to  PRs150 million, but currently face constraints in accessing \nworking  capital.  Larger  pharmacies,  wholesale  distributors,  and  hospitals  usually  do  not  have \ndifficulty  in  accessing  credit.  It  is  envisaged  that  most  SMEs  included  in  the  guaranteed  loan \nportfolio  will  not  have  a  borrowing  relationship  with  the  PFI  prior  to  the  PCG  agreement.  The \nrelation between the PFI and the SME may be established either through (i) confirmation of the \nPFI\u2019s corporate client that the SME is one of its suppliers, vendors, or established clients; or (ii) \na guarantee of the corporate client on behalf of the SME. Existing SME clients of the PFI may \nalso be included if this entails an increase in their credit limit. Direct relationships of PFIs with \nSME clients are also encouraged within an agreed lending approach. PCGs issued to PFIs will \nbe limited to SME loan portfolios. All financially sound FIs in Pakistan established in the private \nsector are eligible to access the facility, subject to a satisfactory due diligence result. \n \n94. \nPricing. The PFI will pay to ADB a predetermined fee either as a fixed rate based on the \nPFIs\u2019  profit  in  lending  to  SMEs  in  the  agreed  portfolio  and  reviewed  semiannually,  or  as  a \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nvariable rate reflecting the PFIs\u2019 profit as documented in the PFIs\u2019 financial statements. The fee \nwill be market based and determined for each PFI based on the risks identified during the due \ndiligence  process  and  the  risk-sharing  mechanism  agreed  between  ADB  and  the  PFI,  as \napproved  by  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee  Committee  chaired  by  the Office of Cofinancing Operations. In \naccordance with market practice no front-end fee will be charged. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation and Monitoring \n\nGuarantee  Agreements,  Reporting,  and  Management  by  ADB.  ADB  will  enter  into \n95. \nPCG agreements with each PFI, which will define the portfolio to be covered including the PFI\u2019s \nSME  target  benchmarks  and  the  loss  limit  for  that  PCG.  The  conditions  of  each  PCG  will  be \ndetermined on a case-by-case basis based on the due diligence of the PFI and its SME lending \nprocesses and operations. Terms and conditions for each PCG will be detailed in a term sheet \nin  line  with  the  parameters  described  in  this  RRP,  subject  to  review  by  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee \nCommittee and procedures detailed in a Guarantee Administration Memorandum (GAM) prior to \nits  finalization.  Each  PCG  agreement  will  follow  a  standardized  format  and  detail  the \nrequirement  for  quarterly  reporting,  as  well  as  prompt  information  on  any  potential  losses  or \ndefaults in the portfolio. ADB will monitor the utilization of the PCG  facility through semiannual \non-site review of the PFIs\u2019 exposure to SMEs, especially the portfolio quality underwritten by the \nPFIs  and  the  PFIs\u2019  meeting  of  agreed  business  targets  of  providing  credit  to  additional  lower \nsegments  of  SMEs  as  reflected  in  the  agreed  business  plans,  and  will  allow  monitoring \ncompliance with negative lists.  ADB  has  the  option  to  modify  existing  guarantee  parameters, \nwith adequate notice, or suspend new SME loan inclusions under the guaranteed portfolio.  \n \nGuarantee  Administration  Memorandum.  The  GAM  will  be  prepared  by  the  South \n96. \nAsia  Department  and  set  out  the  respective  responsibilities  of  ADB  departments  concerned \n(Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations;  Office  of  the  General  Counsel;  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department;  Pakistan  Resident  Mission;  Private  Sector  Operations  Department; \nand Governance, Finance and Trade Division, South Asia Department) in the selection of PFIs \nand  management  of  the  facility,  including  developmental  and  commercial  aspects,  and  the \nestablishment  of  an  environment  management  system  as  prescribed  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy. \n \n97. \nLoss  Determination,  Adjustment,  and  Claims  Payment.  Risks  guaranteed  under \neach  PCG  are  losses,  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  loss-sharing  ratios,  which  result  from \nirrecoverable  principal  and  interest  payment  default  on  loans  included  in  the  guaranteed \nportfolio.  Losses  are  determined  by  the  PFI  in  a  transparent  manner,  which  will  include \nappropriate  documentation  of  defaults  of  loans  included  in  the  guaranteed  portfolio.  ADB  will \nreimburse  the  PFI  for  the  guaranteed  percentage  of  losses  arising  from  guaranteed  risks. \nClaims will be paid in Pakistan rupees, subject to the US dollar limit of the PCG for that PFI.  \n \n98. \nSafeguard  Policies.  The  PCG  facility  is  classified  as  \u201cFinancial  Intermediary\u201d  for  the \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement  system,  which  will  be  detailed  in  the  GAM  and  specified  for  each  PFI  under  the \nguarantee  agreement  to  ensure  PFIs\u2019  adherence  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  as  well  as  to  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, and procurement. The GAM will also require PFIs under the \nguarantee  agreements  to  acknowledge  in  progress  reports  that  all  borrowers  comply  with \nhealth,  safety,  and  environmental  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  public  consultation \nrequirements applicable in Pakistan. Since the PFIs\u2019 loans to SMEs will be largely in the trade \nand light-manufacturing sector, it is unlikely that involuntary resettlement or detrimental impacts \n\n\f 26\n\non  indigenous  peoples  will  occur.  As  for  environmental  safeguards,  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  will \nidentify areas for remedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n99. \nThe TA will assist the Government and private sector stakeholders in the coordination of \nthe  SDP  reforms.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  to  be  $315,000  equivalent,  all  in  local \ncurrency. ADB  will  provide  $250,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded TA \nprogram  to  cover  part  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  the  TA.  The  Government  will  provide  the \nremaining  $65,000  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  offices,  transportation,  and \nincidental expenses. The TA will be implemented over 45 months. An individual consultant will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants (Appendix 10). \n \n100.  ADB  Implementation  Arrangements.  In  addition  to  the  consultant,  ADB  will  support \nprogram implementation through a team including (i) a full-time professional staff person to be \nlocated at the Pakistan Resident Mission in charge of the day-to-day coordination of the SDP; \n(ii)  the  mission  leader  located  in  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Department;  and  (iii)  team \nmembers  from  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department,  Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations, \nand the Office of the General Counsel to support implementation of the PCG facility. ADB will \nconduct jointly with the Government at least semiannual reviews. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\nA. \n \n101.  Policy.   BDS  and  financial  services  directly  enhance  SME  competitiveness  and \nproductivity,  which  have  a  direct  positive  impact  on  SME  profitability  and  favorably  impact  job \nsecurity and employment creation. The private sector BDS providers and the FIs will be able to \nfavorably  respond  to  policy  reforms  under  the  SDP.  The  SDP  provides  the  framework  for \ndeveloping  a  consistent  SME  policy  and  provides  a  critical  linkage  of  reforms  with  knowledge \nenhancement  and  financial  resource  flow  to  SMEs.  The  SDP  also  supports  the creation of  a \nlevel  playing  field  in  the  financial  sector  through  privatization  of  SME  Bank  and  termination  of \nSBP\u2019s  special  relationship  with  SME  Bank,  consistent  with  SBP\u2019s  role  of  a  regulator  and  the \nprivatization  efforts  under  the  financial  sector  reform  program.  A  strong  CPMU  supports  the \nimplementation  of  a  consultative  approach  of  policy  development,  and  close  coordination  with \nstakeholders and within the Government. The policy reforms will: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\ndetermine  the  role  of  the  Government  and  the  private  sector  in  SME \ndevelopment  by  limiting  the  role  of  the  Government  to  policy  setting  and \nfacilitation, and supporting development of service markets by the private sector; \nset a standard for labor protection and inspection for employers and employees \nthrough acknowledgment of basic labor rights, enhancing labor productivity, and \nreducing  interference  and  costs  of  doing  business  through  a  policy  of  least \nintervention by the Government; \nfocus public sector institutions on policy support and facilitation; \nimprove access of SMEs to BDS; \nimprove the FIs\u2019 capacity and financial resource flow to serve SMEs; and \nterminate SME Bank\u2019s role in the public sector through privatization. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nInstitutional.  The  SDP  will  support  the  rationalization  and  restructuring  of  two  public \n102. \nsector institutions, SMEDA and SME Bank. SMEDA will, under the Program, follow a business \nplan to expand its outreach and policy support to SMEs, and its management will benefit from \nbusiness rules enhancing its accountability for day-to-day operations. SME Bank will go through \na  substantial  rationalization  effort  to  reduce  excessive  cost  and  contingent  liabilities  to  the \nGovernment, and start building the foundations for a viable bank followed by its privatization. \n \n103.  Outreach  to  Beneficiaries.  SMEs  in  both  the  informal  and  formal  sectors  will be the \nbeneficiaries of the SDP. It is estimated that about 8,000 SMEs will benefit from the operations \nof  the  BSF  over  the  5-year  program  period.  It  is  expected  that  through  the  SME  finance \ncapacity-building program, four commercial FIs will establish  dedicated SME finance units and \nwill  be  able  to  benefit  about  30,000  SMEs  over  the  project  implementation  period.  This  will \nsecure and generate substantial employment. \n \n104.  Safeguards.  Since  the  major  thrust  of  the  SDP  is  on  capacity  building  and  no \nconstruction  is  involved,  the  SME  SDP  will  not  have  adverse  impacts  on  resettlement  and \nindigenous  peoples  and  the  environment  and  will  thus  not  trigger  mitigating  measures  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  indigenous  peoples  and  on  involuntary  resettlement. Staff \nretrenchment at SME Bank will be addressed through severance packages, job counseling, and \nretraining to facilitate the reemployment of redundant staff. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Supplementary Appendix 2. \n \n105.  With  regard  to  the  PCG  facility,  the  compliance  of  the  PFIs  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies  will  be  examined  at  due  diligence  of  each  PFI.  However,  because  of  the  short-term \nnature of the loans guaranteed and the negative list applied, it is unlikely that the interventions \nunder the PCG facility will trigger actions under ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. \n \nB. \n \n106.  The program design makes a number of assumptions with varying degrees of risk. It is \nassumed  that  Pakistan  will  not  suffer  from  any  adverse  geopolitical  changes  affecting  its \nexternal  and  internal  stability.  Furthermore,  the  Government  is  expected  to  remain  strongly \ncommitted  to  the  reforms  undertaken  since  1997,  supporting  the  poverty  orientation  of  public \nexpenditure, the promotion of SMEs, and financial sector reforms. So far the Government has \ndemonstrated strong ownership and maintains high priority for the development of SMEs. \n \n107.  The  reforms  involve  a  number  of  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  The  implementation \nrisks  have  been  addressed  through  the  establishment  of  strong  oversight,  implementation, \ncoordination,  and  governance  provisions  in  the  implementation  framework.  Reforms  will  be \nimplemented  through  agencies  experienced  with  other  complex  reform  programs,  while  the \nestablishment of a CPMU at MOF will ensure that implementation risks are properly managed.  \n \n108.  Credibility  of  the  reforms  in  the  private  sector  and  in  society  at  large  is  essential.  The \nprogram  design  mitigates  the  risk  through  the  establishment  of  task  forces  representing \nstakeholders  and  through  awareness  building  and  consultation  mechanisms  in  developing \npolicy  and  disseminating  the  content.  Public  sector  institutions  also  bear  a  risk  of  low  public \ncredibility and of politicization. To reduce this risk, lead institutions such as SMEDA will prepare \nand  implement  business  plans,  which  are  shared  with  the  public.  SME  Bank  will  prepare  and \nimplement  a  restructuring  plan  followed  by  a  privatization  plan,  which  will  be  shared  with  the \npublic once it is finalized. Support for public and private sector institutions under the SDP will be \nsubject to scrutiny by of the steering committee and to regular performance audits. \n\nRisks \n\n\f 28\n\n109.  SME  Bank  has  been  a  politicized  organization  and  staff  values  could  adversely  affect \nrestructuring  and  privatization.  Autonomy  of  management  could  be  eroded  and  expected \nimprovements  in  operations  may  not  materialize.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  the  Government  will \nagree  to  a  restructuring  plan,  which  involves  a  substantial  upfront  rationalization  of  staff  and \nthus reduction of operational costs. In addition, credit management will be strengthened through \nthe appointment of a new head for the SME business unit, which will lead the buildup of the new \noperations.  Recruitment  for  the  new  business  operations  of  SME  Bank  will  be  done  in  a \ntransparent manner through the market. Support is also made contingent on the performance of \nand emphasis on operational restructuring and the tranching of the loan. \n \n110.  Overall program risks have been mitigated through utilization of a number of institutions, \npredominantly in the private sector. The use of institutions such as private sector FIs or private \nBDS providers puts the program foundation on a broader basis and thereby reduces the risk if \nan  institution  fails  to  deliver.  The  Program  also  adopts  an  approach  of  pilot  testing  BDS  and \nfinancial services before rollout, thereby lessening the risk of failure. Finally, the SDP builds on \nexisting initiatives of other funding agencies and thereby reduces the complexity of the Program. \nAn overview of funding agency activities is in Supplementary Appendix 3. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n111.

On  1  January  2002  the \nGovernment  merged  two  failed  development  finance  institutions  (DFIs),  the  Regional \nDevelopment Finance Corporation and the Small Business Finance Corporation into SME Bank, \na  public  limited  company,  pursuant  to  the  RDFC  and  SBFC  Amalgamation  and  Conversion \nOrdinance 2001. SME Bank inherited PRs9.5 billion of nonperforming loans (the \u201cold portfolio\u201d). \nThe Bank\u2019s main function is to provide term credit to SMEs. Despite its mandate, loan exposure \nis only 0.5% of the total SME loans provided by the banking system. Seriously undermined by \nthe  burden  inherited  from  its  precursor  institutions,  its  operations  have  never  been  profitable. \nThe Government believes that it is vital that SME Bank continues to provide financing to SMEs, \nespecially to the underserved lower end of SMEs with annual revenues of up to PRs100 million \nand maximum loan size of PRs10 million. \n \n2. \nOwnership and Management. The share ownership of SME  Bank was determined by \nthe  proportional  amount  of  ownership  by  the  shareholders  in  Regional  Development  Finance \nCorporation and Small Business Finance Corporation and the net asset values of the two banks \nas of 31 December 2001. The total authorized share capital is PRs10 billion consisting of PRs1 \nbillion  of  ordinary  shares  of  PRs10  each.  Through  direct  ownership\u201457.1%\u2014and  indirect \nownership\u2014(State  Bank  of  Pakistan  [SBP]  12.8%),  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  (2.6%),  and \nHabib  Bank  (8.2%)\u2014the  Government  owns  the  majority  of  the  Bank.  The  board  of  directors \nconsists  of  seven  members  including  the  chief  executive  officer,  two  government  officials,  two \npresidents  of  state-owned  banks,  and  two  presidents  of  privatized  banks.  The  management \nconsists of the president and seven executive directors. Means available to the management for \nassessing liquidity, interest rate, and credit risks are weak.  \n \n3. \nOrganization and Staffing. From its head office in Islamabad, SME Bank operates four \nprovincial  offices  and  59  branches,  and  a  leasing  subsidiary  with  seven  branches.  Most \nbranches are used for loan recovery. The Bank inherited approximately 1,000 employees with \nregular employment status, of which almost none have proper lending skills. About 900 of the \nemployees  have  been  assigned  to  recover  loans  from  the  old  portfolio.  Despite  their  low \nqualifications,  the  staff  benefit  from  above-market  salary  and  benefit  packages  and  can  be \nconsidered  SME  Bank\u2019s  largest  liability.  Since  there  has  been  only  a  limited  change  in  staff, \nrecent  operations  have  shown  that  the  proportion  of  classified  loans  of  the  new  loan  portfolio \nhas substantially increased. It is assumed that portfolio quality will  further deteriorate unless a \nsignificant change is introduced.  \n \n4. \nLending Policies and Procedures. SME Bank provides term loans of up to 7 years, at \nan average term of 3 years and an average size of about PRs0.4 million. Branches and regional \noffices have loan approval authority ranging up to PRs0.2 million and from PRs0.2 million\u20130.3 \nmillion  to  PRs2.0  million,  respectively,  while  headquarters  approves  all  other  loans.  Loans  are \nprimarily  approved  on  the  basis  of  collateral.  There  is  no  formal  policy  for  offering  differential \ninterest rates based on the client\u2019s credit rating, term, or type of lending. The average interest \nrate for all loans is about 13%. Based on the bank\u2019s cost of funds, historical loan defaults, and \nrecovery, it is believed that the loans are priced at a loss. SME Bank\u2019s income recognition and \nprovisioning  for  bad  debts  are  in  compliance  with  SBP  prudential  regulations.  For  loans  more \nthan 90 days overdue, the income accrual is suspended and the loans are categorized as \u201cother \nassets especially mentioned.\u201d Long-term loans delinquent for more than 365 days are classified \nas substandard, 730 days as doubtful, and above 3 years as loss. SBP requires that provisions \nbe  made  for  20%  of  substandard  accounts,  50%  for  doubtful  debts,  and  100%  for  the  loss \ncategory. Provisioning for loan losses as of year-end 2002 was PRs6.7 billion or 76% of the old \nportfolio.  Recoveries  from  the  old  portfolio  amounted  to  PRs1.4  billion  over  SME  Bank\u2019s  18 \nmonths until June 2003, and 11% of the new portfolio are classified loans only after 18 months \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nof  operation.  SME  Bank\u2019s  portfolio  quality  has  been  affected  by  (i)  weak  loan  appraisal,  (ii) \nabsence  of  credit  risk  management,  and  (iii)  inadequate  internal  audit  controls.  The  bank\u2019s \nefforts for collection of the overdue loans related to its new operations have been modest. \n \n5. \nResource Mobilization. Total assets increased marginally since SME Bank\u2019s creation. \nDeposits  as  part  of  Regional  Development  Finance  Corporation\u2019s  activities  dropped  by  50%, \nsince SME Bank lacks a banking license. Receiving 83% of its resources in June 2003 through \ninterest-free  loans,  SME  Bank  enjoys  special  privileges  from  SBP,  which  were  invested  in \nprofitable government bonds (Table A3.1). \n \n\nTable A3.1: SME Bank Summary of Assets and Liabilities \n(PRs million) \n\nChange \nJan\u2013Dec \n2002 (%)  \n0.6 \n-17.3 \n-7.4 \n-0.8 \n-23.4 \n29.5 \n60.2 \n\n \n30 Jun \n2003b \n15,212.4 \n2,506.8 \n8,365.7 \n(6,733.3) \n1,633.4 \n874.4 \n7,657.4 \n\nOpening \nBalance \n1 Jan 2002a \n15,052.7 \n3,139.8 \n9,542.6 \n(6,768.4) \n2,774.2 \n365.6 \n4,227.1 \n\n \n \n31 Dec 2002\n15,140.3 \n2,597.5 \n8,837.0 \n(6,712.9) \n2,124.1 \n473.5 \n6,773.5 \n\nComposition \n30 Jun 2003 \n(%) \n100 \n16 \n \n \n11 \n6 \n50 \n\n \n \n \nItem \nTotal Assets \nLoans  \nOld Portfolio \nProvisions  \nNet Old Portfolio \nNet New Loans  \nInvestments \nCash and Short-Term \nInvestments \nReceivable from SBP \nOther Assets  \nTotal Liabilities and Equity \nAdvances from SBP \nDeposits from Customers  \nOther Liabilities  \nEquityc \nSBP = State Bank of Pakistan. \na  The SME Bank was formed on 31 October 2001 but was not operational until 1 January 2002. \nb  Unaudited results. \nc  Includes surplus on revaluation of investment of PRs576 million for 31 December 2002 and PRs711 million for 30 \n\nChange \nJan\u2013June \n2003 (%)  \n0.5 \n-3.5 \n-5.3 \n0.3 \n-23.1 \n84.9 \n13.0 \n\n \n863.8 \n3,352.6 \n831.8 \n15,212.4 \n12,686.5 \n242.4 \n1,170.0 \n1,113.5 \n\n3,243.6 \n3,764.8 \n677.4 \n15,052.7 \n13,261.8 \n478.6 \n1,330.4 \n(18.2) \n\n1,263.8 \n3,521.2 \n984.4 \n15,140.3 \n12,882.6 \n447.1 \n835.3 \n975.3 \n\n-61.0 \n-6.5 \n45.3 \n0.6 \n-2.9 \n-6.6 \n-37.2 \n \n\n-31.7 \n-4.8 \n-15.5 \n0.5 \n-1.5 \n-45.8 \n40.1 \n14.2 \n\n6 \n22 \n5 \n100 \n83 \n2 \n8 \n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nJune 2003. \n\nSource: SME Bank. \n \n6. \nProfitability.  During  2002,  SME  Bank  reported  a  net  profit  of  PRs34  million.  A \nsubstantial  portion  of  the  profit  was  generated  from  investment  income.  After  adjustments  for \ninvestment  income,  SBP  share  of  profits,  and  taxes  paid,  the  banking  operations generated a \nnet loss of PRs390 million. For the 6 months of 2003, SME Bank reported a net profit of PRs30 \nmillion and banking operations registered a net loss of PRs147 million (Table A3.2). \n \n\nTable A3.2: SME Bank Profitability \n(PRs million) \n\n \nItem \nIncome from Banking Operations \nIncome from Investments \nInterest Expense \nAdministrative and Other Operating Expenses \nProvisions for Doubtful Assets \nNet Profit/Loss \nReturn on Total Assetsb \na  Unaudited results. \nb  Based on actual year-end figures. \nSource: SME Bank \n \n\nJan\u2013Dec 2002 \n817 \n725 \n81 \n798 \n368 \n34 \n\n0.2% \n\nJan\u2013June 2003a \n426 \n352 \n4 \n281 \n292 \n30 \n\n0.2% \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3  41 \n\n7. \nAccounting  and  Management  Information  System  (MIS).  SME  Bank  follows \naccounting  standards  consistent  with  the  requirements  for  the  banking industry. The income, \nborrowing costs, interest on deposits, and other expenses are accounted on an accrual basis. \nThe  accrued  interest  for  a  loan  that  is  delinquent  for  more  than  90  days  is  reversed  from  the \nincome account and transferred to a suspense account. Independent external auditors audit the \nannual  accounts.  The  MIS  and  information  technology  (IT)  platform  are  outdated.  In  the \nabsence of network information systems, information gathering from branches is characterized \nby delays and inaccuracies. A fully automated banking system is now being implemented.  \n \nRestructuring  SME  Bank.  The  SME  Bank  board  of  directors  and  the  Government \n8. \ndecided that it is necessary to restructure SME Bank, since (i) its operation is not sustainable; \n(ii) there is a need to meet the demand for financial services for the underserved lower end of \nthe SMEs; and (iii) the bank\u2019s financial weakness deters SME lending. To determine the scope \nof the restructuring, an audit was performed by Taseer Hadi Khalid & Co., a firm associated with \nKPMG.  The  plan  indicates  that  operating  self-sufficiency  of  banking  operations  could  be \nobtained by implementing a plan, which includes substantial reductions in the number of regular \nstaff and branches. The Government and SME Bank management prepared a restructuring plan \naiming at SME Bank\u2019s privatization within a 3-year period. The business will be reorganized into \nan SME business unit and a distressed portfolio recovery unit. Additionally, the plan includes (i) \na  time-bound  action  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  bank  branches  and  rationalize  staff  of  the \nrecovery unit to a sustainable cost level; and (ii) an independent human resources audit to (a) \nevaluate  the  skills  of  the  employees  at  the  bank;  (b)  identify  and match skills for specific jobs \nwithin  the  bank;  (c)  identify  alternative  job  opportunities  for  employees;  and  (d) provide  job-\nsearch  assistance  and  reemployment  training  for  personnel.

A  developed  and \nappropriately  supported  SME  sector  can  facilitate  poverty  reduction  by  generating  new \nenterprises, employment, and labor productivity, thereby increasing competitiveness, improving \nincome  distribution,  broadening  the  accumulation  of  wealth,  and  cushioning  business  cycle \neffects.  It  is  essential  to  develop  an  SME  policy  to  recognize  and  promote  appropriate \nmechanisms by which the poverty-reduction impact of SME promotion can be maximized. The \nMinistry  of  Industries  and  Production  (MOIP)  through  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment  Authority  (SMEDA)  has  taken  on  the  mandate  to  prepare  the  SME  policy.  The \nSME  policy  will  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  encouraging  SME  development  and \ncompetitiveness, by specifying the role of  the  private  and  public  sectors  in  SME  development \nand institutionalizing SME support. \n \n2. \nTask  Force. The SME policy will require inputs from a wide range of stakeholders. To \ndevelop the SME policy, MOIP will establish a task force (TF) chaired by the Secretary of MOIP, \nwhich will comprise representatives from the following organizations: \n \n\nMOIP; \nMinistry of Commerce; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  Ministry of Finance; \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n\nState Bank of Pakistan (SBP); \nMinistry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis (MOL); \nExport Promotion Bureau; \nprovincial economic development departments; \nchambers of commerce; \nindustry and trade associations; \nprofessional organizations; \nfinancial institutions; and \nprivate  sector  representatives  of  SMEs  and/or  SME  organizations  from  each \nprovince. \n\n \n3. \nThe  TF  will  determine  its  rules  of  business  (and  may  determine  that  private  sector \nrepresentatives will be nonvoting members). Other organizations and individuals can be invited \nto join the TF at the discretion of the TF. The TF may also invite written submissions from the \ngeneral  public.  MOIP  has  appointed  SMEDA  to  maintain  the  secretariat  functions  for  the  TF \nincluding  maintaining  records  of  meetings,  providing  administrative  support  and,  under  the \nguidance of the TF, assisting in the preparation of drafts of the SME policy. \n \n4. \n \n\nThe purpose of the SME policy is to: \n\n(i) \n\ndevelop  a  definition  of  SME,  based  on  numbers  of  employees  and/or  annual \nturnover,  including  subdivisions  into  different  sizes  of  SMEs,  and  determine \n\n                                                 \n1  Costs  and  financing  of  the  subproject  are  summarized  in  Appendix  7.  Implementation  arrangements  of  the \n\nsubproject are detailed in Appendix 8. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4  43 \n\nwhether  and  how  the  definition  should  vary  for  different  purposes,  such  as \nregistration,  financial  assistance,  access  to  support  services,  and  industry \nspecifics ; \ndefine  the  roles  of  different  stakeholders  in  SME  support,  including  national \nministries, provincial and local government departments, private sector SME and \nSME  organizations,  employer  and  worker  organizations,  academia,  and \nnongovernment  organizations;  and  adopt  a \nleast-intervention  government \napproach; \ninstitutionalize  the  SME  support  system  to  ensure  regular  communication \nbetween  the  national,  provincial,  and  local  governments  and  the  target \nstakeholders  through  (a)  permanent  national  policy  committee,  (b)  regular \ncoordination \ndifferent \nlevels \nministries/departments,  (c)  regular  monitoring  and  independent  evaluation,  (d) \ncontinuous  absorption  and  integration  of  international  experience  to  refine  the \nsupport system, and (e) biannual report to Parliament on SME development; \ncommunicate legislation and its purpose effectively through the dissemination of \npolicy, regulation and support services, and timeliness of translation of laws into \nappropriate regulations utilizing local language; \nidentify  and  address  major  demand-side  SME  concerns  including  (a)  business \nenvironment  (regulation,  inspection,  annual  fiscal  policy  changes,  and  region-\nspecific  concerns),  (b)  competitiveness  (including  adequate  human  resources \nand access to premises), and (c) access to finance; and \nexpand  support  services  through  encouraging  private  sector  providers,  start-up \nassistance,  assistance  to  companies,  sole  proprietorships  and  partnerships, \ntechnology transfer, competitiveness research, and international trade. \n\ngovernment \n\ndifferent \n\namong \n\nand \n\nof \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n5. \nDeveloping SM E Policy. The TF will (i) draft an issues paper, (ii) draft the SME policy, \nand (iii) consult with key stakeholders including SMEs and SME organizations in each province \non each draft of the SME policy. \n \nDevelopment  and  Implementation  of  Action  Plan.  The  TF  will  present  a  detailed \n6. \nprocess  and \nfor  consultative  preparation  and \nimplementation of the SME policy to the minister of industries and production by 30 June 2004. \nThe TF will operate  in accordance with the time-bound action plan. The TF will submit the final \nSME policy to the minister by June 2005. By December 2006, the Government will implement \nthe SME policy in accordance with the priorities set out in the time bound action and resource \nplan, including publication of the first annual SME report in Urdu. \n \n\ntime-bound  action  and  resource  plan \n\n2. \n\nThe Assistance: Objectives and Scope  \n\n \nThe  Project  will  provide  consulting  services  to  SMEDA  and  the  TF  in  developing  the \n7. \nSME policy. The objective of the assistance is to support the TF in the timely development and \ndissemination of the SME policy through: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nadvice to the TF and other stakeholders on international good practice; \nsupport and facilitation of activities building stakeholder consensus; \ncollaboration  with  MOIP,  TF,  the  core  program  management  unit,  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  any  policy  or  implementation  issues  and \nrecommendation of specific remedies; \ndevelopment of a consistent policy document and a focused action plan reflecting \npriorities of SME policy; and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n(v) \n\nassistance \nstakeholders and sharing of relevant information with the public. \n\nto  organize  and  moderate  discussions  and  workshops  with \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n8. \nThe  implementing  agency  will  be  SMEDA.  The  assistance  will  be  implemented \nintermittently over 36 months. An international SME policy specialist (1.5 months), and domestic \nSME  specialists  (11  months)  will  support  the  TF.  SMEDA  will  provide  office  facilities  for  the \nconsultants. The consultants will have expertise in policy development and will be selected by \nthe  implementing  agency  after  concurrence  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic  cons ultants  acceptable  for  ADB.  Besides  the  terms  of  reference,  the  consultants  will \nprepare quarterly progress reports and a final report at the end of the task.  \n \n9. \n \n\nThe consultants will provide the following services to the TF: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nassist  private  sector  led  policy  advisory  groups  in  identifying  issues,  solutions \nand  priorities  for  action,  and  assist  in  preparing  concise  recommendations  for \npolicy reform; \nassist the TF in drafting an SME policy in a consultative process; \nassist  the  Government  in  issuing  the  policy  and  preparing  and  action  and \nresource plan for its implementation;  \nimprove depth and accuracy of statistics to monitor SME policy impact, including: \n(a) \n(b) \n\ndeveloping a plan to conduct an SME survey on annual basis; \ndesigning  a  database  for  an  SME  survey  and  recommending  the \nparameters that should be included in the database; \ndesigning  an  SME  survey  and  choosing  a  firm  to  conduct  the  first  or \nbaseline survey; \ndesigning a computer database to permit SME information to be retrieved \nwhen needed and for yearly statistics to be combined or analyzed; and \ndeveloping a detailed plan for publishing and distributing the survey. \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(c) \n\nComponent 1.2: Labor Protection and Inspection Policy Development \n\n1. \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\n \n10.  MOL has undertaken the mandate to prepare a labor protection policy (LPP) and labor \ninspection  policy  (LIP).  The  policies  fall  within  a  hierarchy  of  policies  under  which  national \ndevelopment  policies  determine  national  labor  policy.  The  national labor policy will determine \nthe LPP, which sets the framework for the LIP. The LPP and LIP will reflect the Government\u2019s \nimproving \nobjective  of  promoting  business  opportunities,  enhancing  productivity,  and \ncompetitiveness,  and  ensuring  that  workers  are  adequately  protected  and  benefit  from  the \nnation\u2019s economic progress. \n \nTask  Force.  To  develop  the  LPP  and  LIP,  MOL  has  established  a  TF  chaired  by  a \n11. \nsenior  representative  of  MOL,  which  will  comprise  representatives  from  the  following \norganizations: \n \n\nMOL; \nMinistry of Finance; \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  MOIP; \n\n \n\n \n\n \nB. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 4  45 \n\nMinistry of Social Welfare and Women\u2019s Development; \nprovincial labor departments; \n\n(iv)  Ministry of Commerce; \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii)  Pakistan Employers\u2019 Federation; \n(viii)  Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions; \n(ix) \nAll Pakistan Federation of Labor; and \n(x)  Workers Employers Bilateral Council of Pakistan. \n\n \nOther organizations and individuals can be invited to join the TF at the discretion of the \n12. \nchairperson  and  the  TF  itself.  The  TF  may  also  invite  written  submissions  from  the  general \npublic.  MOL  will  appoint  a  secretary  and  support  staff  to  the  TF,  who  will  be  responsible  for \nmaintaining  records  of  meetings,  providing  administrative  support  and,  under  the  guidance  of \nthe TF, assisting in the preparation of LPP and LIP drafts. \n \n13. \nDeveloping  LPP.  The  TF  will  draft  a  policy  titled  Labor  Protection  Policy  2004  and \nconsult with key stakeholders including representatives of employers and workers and provincial \nlabor departments on the draft, finalize the LPP, and submit the final LPP to the minister of labor \nby  31  March  2004.  The  purpose  of  the  LPP  is  to  ensure  that  workers\u2019  rights  are  protected, \nworking conditions are fair, and enterprise efficiency and competitiveness are encouraged. The \nobjectives of the LPP are to:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nprotect workers in all sectors engaged under various employment arrangements \nincluding  (a)  formal  employment  contracts,  (b)  self-employment, (c) agricultural \nand informal sector, (d) seasonal, and (e) home work; \ncontribute  to  labor  productivity  enhancement,  and  assist  enterprises  to  become \nmore efficient and competitive; and \nalert  employers,  workers,  potential  investors,  and  the  international  community \nthat  Pakistan  is  committed  to  improving  labor  protection  as  part  of  its \ndevelopment strategy. \n\n \n14. \nDeveloping LIP. Draft a policy titled Labor Inspection Policy 2004 and consult with key \nstakeholders  including  representatives  of  employers  and  workers  and  provincial  labor \ndepartments on the  draft,  finalize  the  LIP  based  on  consultations  as  required,  and  submit  the \nfinal LIP to the minister of labor by 30 September 2004. \n \n15. \nplace to effectively implement the LPP. The objectives of LIP are to: \n \n\nThe  purpose  of  the  LIP  is  to  ensure  that  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  are  in \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nadopt an innovative approach to labor inspection that is flexible, transparent, and \nfair; \nensure that inspection also covers informal sector enterprises; \nencourage the private sector to provide labor inspection services; \nencourage  enterprise  compliance  with  labor  policies  and  laws  through  means \nother than rigid law enforcement; and \nencourage  increased  harmony  and  dispute  prevention  in  enterprises  between \nworkers and managers. \n\n \n16. \nImplementation of Action Plan. The TF will operate in accordance with a time-bound \naction plan drafted by MOL, to be endorsed by the TF. The work of the TF will be assisted by \ntwo  policy  outlines  prepared  by  MOL  to  highlight  key  issues  and  give  a  focus  to  the  TF\u2019s \ndeliberations  without  limiting  the  breadth  and  scope  of  discussions.  The  TF  will  strive  for \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nconsensus on the policy issues. Where this proves to be impossible, different viewpoints will be \nrecorded and presented to the minister of labor for advice and, if necessary, final decision. The \nTF  is  concerned  solely  with  policy  matters  and  is  not  required  to  involve  itself  in  legislation. \nOnce  both  the  LPP  and  LIP  have  been  finalized  and  endorsed  by  the  Cabinet,  the  TF  will \nconduct  awareness  raising  for  employers\u2019  and  workers\u2019  organizations  on  both  policies  at  the \nprovincial level. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Assistance: Objectives and Scope  \n\n \n17. \nADB  will  provide  assistance  through  consulting  services  to  the  MOL  Central  Labour \nAdvisory  Unit  and  the  Social  Security  Unit  and  the  TF  in  developing  the  LPP  and  LIP.  The \nobjective of the assistance is to support the TF in the timely development and dissemination of \nthe LPP and LIP, and will include the following areas: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\nadvice to the TF and other stakeholders on international good practice; \nsupport and facilitation in building stakeholder consensus; \ncollaboration with MOL and TF, the core program management unit, and ADB on \nany policy or implementation issues and recommendation of specific remedies; \nfollow-up on the progress of the LPP and LIP policy measures; and \nassistance \nstakeholders and sharing of relevant information with the public. \n\nto  organize  and  moderate  discussions  and  workshops  with \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\n \nThe  implementing  agency  will  be  MOL.

MOL will provide office facilities \nfor the consultants. In addition to the tasks specified under para. 17, the consultants will assist \nthe  TF  in  preparing  progress  reports,  and  ADB  missions.  The  consultants  will  be  experienced \nlabor policy specialists and recruited on an individual basis consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the use of domestic consultants satisfactory \nto ADB.

Business  development  services  are  demand  driven \nand  include  a  large  variety  of  services  including  business  planning,  production  management, \nproduct  design,  quality  standards  and  control,  productivity  studies,  marketing,  information \nsystems,  and  training.  Currently,  Pakistan  lacks  a  BDS  market  for  SMEs,  with  constraints  on \nboth the supply and the demand side. On the supply side, BDS providers target the larger well-\nestablished  enterprises,  while  on  the  demand  side  SMEs  lack  access  to  a  wide  range  of \ncompetitively priced services targeted to their business needs. \n \n2. \nInternational  experience  with  BDS  in  developing  markets  shows  that  two  basic \napproaches  have  been  followed:  (i)  creation  of  a  public  sector  service  provider;  and  (ii) \nfacilitation  of  a  demand-driven,  decentralized  market  for  private  sector  service  providers. \nExperience  illustrates  that  the  first  approach  has  not  succeeded  because  setting  up  one \ndominant or single service provider in the public sector places that entity in a privileged position, \nenabling it to undermine other market participants because of free or highly subsidized services; \nit  is  also  supply  driven,  and  thus  particularly  unresponsive  to  market  preferences.  Putting \ngovernment-facilitated  programs  for  supporting  BDS  in  the  private  sector  is  effective  because \nthe  market  allocation  process  is  more  efficient  in  determining  the  demand.  There  should  be  a \nrange  of  different  providers,  providing  a  variety  of  different  services.  The  individual  SME \npurchaser of the services should be free to identify its particular BDS needs, select its service \nprovider(s),  and  negotiate  the  terms  of  the  services  provided.  Building  up  an  industry  in  BDS \nprovision strengthens this market  allocation  of  demand  and  supply  in  SME  development.  One \ndesign of government facilitation of the private sector to meet SME development needs that has \nbeen particularly successful in recent years is the cost-sharing grant scheme. \n \n3. \n \n\nThe key features of cost- sharing grant schemes are: \n\na fund is created and advertised widely to BDS users and providers; \nSMEs prepare a plan showing how they intend to improve their competitiveness;  \nSMEs will gain access to services provided by  service providers through a grant, \nif the plan is supported by the managers of the cost-sharing grant facility; and \nassistance is given to SMEs to prepare the plans. \n\nThe cost-sharing grant schemes work for the following reasons: \n\nthe  SME  remains  in  control  of  the  transaction,  choosing  what  the  plan  will  look \nlike,  what  services  to  buy  and  in  what  order,  which  service  provider  to  buy  the \nservices from, and whether the result is satisfactory and thus whether to pay; \nthere is free access to the facility on a first come first served basis for proposals \nof suitable quality; \na market is encouraged in BDS services. Only those service providers that have \ndelivered quality BDS services at competitive prices are likely to be selected by \nsubsequent  SMEs.  The  facility  disseminates  market  information  to  potential \nbuyers of services; \n\n                                                 \n1  Cost and financing of the subproject is summarized in Appendix 7. Implementation arrangements of the subproject \n\nare detailed in Appendix 8. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n4. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthe  scheme  is  deliberately  temporary,  intending  to  jump-start the BDS market; \nand \nthe  scheme  is  deliberately  partial  with  a  high  SME  contribution  in  order  to \npromote sustainability beyond the period of the scheme. \n\nThe Assistance: Objectives and Scope  \n\n \n5. \nHow Cost-Sharing Grant Schemes Have Worked in Other Countries. Recent studies \nhave  looked  at  10  cost-sharing  grant  schemes  in  Bangladesh,  India,  Indonesia,  Kenya, \nMauritius, Mexico, South Africa, and Uganda. The studies measured direct impact, in terms of \nadditional exports generated per dollar of cost-sharing grant support: 48 times within 5 years in \nIndia; 36 times within just 1 year in Indonesia; 30 times in just 1 year in Kenya; 160 times within \n1  year  in  Mauritius.  The  studies  identified  the  following  as  key  areas  in  the  success  of  the \nschemes:  grant  size  and  payment  arrangement,  fund  governance  and  management  (including \noverheads),  service  provider  quality  control,  realistic  SME  and  subproject  eligibility  and  simple \nprocedures, and adequate monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThe Project will establish a cost-sharing grant scheme, the SME Business Support Fund \nCompany,  to  facilitate  SME  development  through  a  market-based  BDS  service  provision,  the \nBusiness Support Fund (BSF). To ensure direct access of SMEs to BDS, strong governance in \nselection and management of BSF-funded projects, and private sector support for the initiative, \nthe  design  of  the  BSF  envisages  its  establishment  through  a  Government  endowment  as  a \nnonprofit  company2  with  the  majority  of  the  directors  of  the  board  representing  the  private \nsector,  and  an  independent  management  unit  led  by  an  experienced  facility  manager.  The \nboard  of  directors  will  approve  a  business  plan  and  standard  operating  procedures  (SOP)  for \nthe management of the BSF based on final drafts, which have been developed. \n \n7. \nThe  BSF  will  support  an  expected  1,500  subprojects,  of  which  more  than  95%  are \nexpected not to exceed a cost-sharing grant value of $15,000. These projects are estimated to \nbenefit  about  8,000  SMEs.  The  implementation  plan,  performance  indicators  and  targets,  and \ninstitutional  setup  for  the  facilities  have  been  included  in  the  business  plan  for  the  BSF.  The \nSOP  specify  among  others  (i)  eligibility  criteria  for  SMEs  and  application  process;  (ii)  rules  to \navoid  conflicts  of  interest  and  misuse  of  funds;  and  (iii)  procedures  for  facility  management \nincluding  the  appraisal  of  applications,  disbursement  procedures,  program  monitoring,  and \nannual review of the performance of the BSF through the board of directors. \n \n8. \n \n\nThe Project will: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nsupport  the  establishment  of  the  BSF  as  a  nonprofit  company  with  a \nmanagement  and  governance  structure  reflecting  international  best  practice  in \ndeveloping markets through consulting services; \nprovide the funds for the cost-sharing grant facility; and \nprovide  operating  expenses, \nfor  competitively  selected, \nexperienced,  competent,  professional  management  for  the  BSF  including  the \nfacility manager and permanent staff to be recruited by the BSF on proposal by \nthe facility manager. \n\nincluding  costs \n\n                                                 \n2  Under Section 42 of the Companies Act, 1984. Articles of association have been prepared. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 5  49 \n\nConsulting Services \n\nC. \n \n9. \nThe Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Finance represented by the core program \nmanagement  unit.  The  implementing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  prior  to \nestablishment of the BSF, and then BSF, commencing on  the date on which BSF enters into a \nproject agreement with Asian Development Bank.  \n \n10. \nThe subproject will be implemented over 60 months. An internationally experienced BDS \nspecialist  will  be  recruited  on  an  intermittent  basis  to  establish  and  manage  the  facility  (32 \nperson-months  over  5  years),  provide  on-the-job training for staff, and induce a senior staff to \ntake over the management function for the BSF. The international expert will be  recruited on an \nindividual basis consistent with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Besides the terms of \nreference, the consultants will prepare brief quarterly progress reports and a final report at the \nend of the task. The specialist will provide the following services to the BSF: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfinalization of the articles of association for BSF and the business plan and SOP \nfor the matching grant facility and incorporation of BSF as a nonprofit company; \nstart-up assistance prior to approval of the board of directors of the business plan \nand SOP, assistance in selection of the management team; \nassistance in advertising the BSF to SMEs and BDS providers; \n\n(iii) \n(iv)  management of the fund; \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nrecruitment of deputy manager and up to full-time professional staff; and  \ntraining of staff. \n\n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development \n11. \nBank's Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement will be limited to office equipment estimated at \n$31,800 equivalent, which will be procured under direct procurement procedures. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSUBPROJECT 3: MARKET DEVELOPMENT FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE \nFINANCE1 \n\nComponent 3.1: \nCapacity Building for Financial Institutions  \n\nRegulatory Policy Development, Credit Information, and \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \nRecent Developments. Consistent with  the  reduction  in  the  discount  rate  of  the  State \n1. \nBank  of  Pakistan  (SBP),  the  average  spread  of  the  banks2 has decreased from 8.5% to 5.7% \nfrom July 2001 until June 2003, while average lending rates decreased from 14.5% to 7.6% in \nthat period. After a 2% increase during FY2002, credit to the private sector slightly declined by \n0.8%  during  the  first  9  months  of  FY2003  to  PRs1,056  billion  ($18.3  billion).  The  largest  total \nlending exposure of banks is to the textile industry (25%) followed by agribusiness (10%), while \nloans  to  trade  and  commercial  enterprises,  which  represent  about  50%  of  all  business \nestablishments,  represented  an  extremely  low  total  share  of  total  lending  exposure  of  3%. \nDuring the first half of 2003, lending to large corporate clients increased by 7% and to consumer \nfinance by 17.3% (although from low levels), while lending to SMEs declined by 4.5%. \n \n2. \nThe  small  increase  in  lending  since  2001  and  the  decrease  during  2003  in  a  period  of \neasing monetary policy and high liquidity in the market could partially be explained by the risk-\nadverse  attitude  of  banks,  and  the  rigidity  in  prudential  regulations  of  SBP,  especially  with \nregard to lending limits and the restriction on banks not being permitted to lend based upon the \nborrowers\u2019  cash  flows  unless  the  loans  are  secured  by  well-documented  assets  (e.g.,  legal \ndocuments  showing  proof  of  ownership).  Additionally,  SBP  and  the  private  sector\u2019s  credit \ninformation bureaus maintain incomplete coverage of loan exposures, which make it difficult for \nfinancial  institutions  (FIs)  to  obtain  the  necessary  credit  information  for  the  smaller  borrowers \nsuch as SMEs. Also, existing secured transactions law and the commercial court systems are \nineffective, thereby contributing to a market that is not conducive to lending to SME clients. By \nimproving  credit  information  and  making  it  possible  to  offer  loans  collateralized  by  movable \nassets, financing to SMEs, especially the smaller informal/nonregistered SMEs, could increase. \n \nSME Finance Activities. SMEs, especially those in the informal sector with fewer than \n3. \n10 employees, are largely financed through the private savings of the owner, retained earnings \nof the enterprise, and/or family and friends. Access to finance from other sources is insignificant. \nAccording  to  a  recent  survey  of  approximately  1,000  SME 3 manufacturers, only 1% of those \nsurveyed  borrowed  money  from  formal  sources  and  such  borrowings  were  mainly  for  working \ncapital purposes. Other sources of financing, such as trade credit, amounted to less than 5% of \nthose  surveyed.  The  SME  survey  confirms  that  utilization  of  credit  from  formal  financial \ninstitutions by manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees is only 7%. In general, the lending \npolicies  of  banks  tend  to  favor  the  manufacturing  sector,  and  since  the  majority  of  SMEs  are \ntrade and service entrepreneurs, utilization of formal credit is insignificant for these enterprises.  \n \n4. \nInformation received from banks lending to SMEs indicates that borrowing of up to PRs5 \nmillion is far less significant and represents about 10,000 borrowers and less than 25% of the \ntotal loans outstanding. According to SBP, loans of up to PRs10 million only represented 0.1% \n\n                                                 \n1  Cost and financing of the subproject is summarized in Appendix 7. Implementation arrangements of the subproject \n\nare detailed in Appendix 8. \n\n2   Defined as the differential between average lending and deposit rates of the banking system. \n3  World Bank and SMEDA. 2003. Investment Climate Assessment of Pakistan. Unpublished. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6  51 \n\nof  total  lending  of  the  banking  system.  While  leasing  companies  are  financing  SMEs,  their \noverall impact is marginal because of their small market share of total lending in the country.  \n \n5. \nCredit  Demand:  Small  SME  Segment.  A  number  of  surveys  confirm  that  from  an \nentrepreneur\u2019s  perspective,  lack  of  access  to  and  cost  of  bank  financing  are  significant \nimpediments to growth. While these factors do not determine actual market demand, less than \n5% of the estimated 230,000 SMEs (employing 5 or more staff) have access to formal credit. \n \nCredit  Demand:  Medium  and  Large  SME  Segment. While the above sample survey \n6. \nindicates  far  better  access  to  credit  for  the  medium  SME  manufacturers,  about  13%  of \nmanufacturing SMEs (with more than 100 employees) reported access to financing for working \ncapital  and  24%  reported  access  to  investment  capital.  There  should  be  significant  market \npotential for SMEs in the trade and service sectors as well as financing for working capital. This \nfact  is  underscored  by  SBP  statistics,  which  report  that  loan  amounts  of  up  to  PRs100  million \nrepresented  less  than  10%  of  banking  system  lending.  The  upper  limit  of  the  SME  market, \nrepresenting exposures of between PRs100 million and PRs300 million, has an estimated 1,000 \nborrowers and appears to be better served. According to information received from banks, more \nthan two thirds of the banks\u2019 exposure to SMEs serves this segment of the market.  \n \n7. \nGovernment  Policies.  As  a  result  of  the  failure  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  for \ndirected  lending  by  development  finance  institution  (DFIs)  to  the  private  sector,  it  adopted  a \npolicy to gradually eliminate DFIs through privatization and/or liquidation. To encourage private \nsector  lending,  SBP  and  the  Government  have  introduced  appropriate  regulatory  and  policy \nprocedures for banks to develop their own SME business strategies. In addition to its regulatory \nfunction, SBP publishes debtor information to help serve financial institutions (FIs) in their credit \nanalysis.  Currently,  SBP\u2019s  Credit  Information  Bureau  maintains  a  registry  of  loans  with  a \nminimum  size  of  PRs  500,000,  but  does  not  aggregate  the  credit  information  by  debtor.  The \nCredit Information Bureau is planning to expand its registry to include loans with a minimum size \nof  PRs200,000.  Additionally,  SBP  is  beginning  to  explore  the  possibilities  of  the  private  sector \nproviding  such  services  to  improve  credit  information  for  FIs.  Secured  financing  is  another \nmeans  of  enhancing  access  to  credit  for  SME  borrowers.  Effective  legislation  would  allow  (i) \nborrowers to offer security interests in movable property, (ii) creditors to establish priority rights \nto  such  security  interests,  (iii)  enforcement  mechanisms  on  priority  rights,  and  (iv)  the \nestablishment of a registry for security interests. If secured financing were available, businesses \nother than FIs might also offer credit to suppliers and customers against secured collateral. \n \n\n2. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n \n8. \nThe  objective  of  this  project  component  is  to  increase  SMEs\u2019  access  to  finance.  The \ncomponent  focuses  on  (i)  developing  a  conducive  regulatory  and  policy  environment  for  SME \nfinance,  (ii)  encouraging  private  FIs  to  develop  SME  lending  capability,  and  (iii)  providing \ncapacity building to participating private FIs (PFIs) committed to operate SME finance units. \n \n9. \nDeveloping a Conducive Regulatory and Policy Environment for SME Finance. In \norder to have a well-functioning financial system for SME lending, regulations, supervision, and \nmonitoring of the FIs must be improved and FIs\u2019 policies and procedures for SME lending must \nbe  introduced.  To  improve  FIs\u2019  ability  in  performing  proper  credit  analysis  on  SMEs,  more \ncomprehensive credit information must be provided to the FIs. Additionally, a feasibility study for \nimproving  the  existing  framework  for  secured  transactions  will  be  prepared  under  a  separate \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) funded grant. A banking regulation and supervision expert with \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nextensive  experience  in  SMEs  will  be  hired  to  assist  in  the  review  of  SBP\u2019s  regulations,  and \nsupervision approach to the SME segment. \n \n10. \nEncouraging  FIs  to  Develop  SME  Lending  Capability.  Commercial  SME  finance  is \nrelatively  new  in  Pakistan.  Capacity  building  on  SME  finance  will  be  offered  to  both  SBP  and \nFIs.  Seminars  and  workshops  will  be  conducted  by  experts  on  the  strategies  and  methods  of \nestablishing  SME  finance  capability  at  the  FIs.  This  entails  market  research,  product \ndevelopment,  lending  processes,  control  systems,  and  capacity  building  of  professional  staff. \nAdvisory support will also be provided to assist FIs in developing SME business strategies.  \n \n11. \nCustomized  Consulting  Services  to  PFIs.  FIs  willing  to  establish  an  SME  financing \nunit  will  be  able  to  access  consulting  services  by  submitting  a  business  plan  for  approval  by \nSBP  and  ADB.  Upon  approval  of  the  FI\u2019s  business  plan,  the  FI  will  be  entitled  to  consulting \nservices on a cost-sharing basis to implement the business plan. \n \n12. \nConsulting Services. Consultants to be financed under this subproject will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  services  require  an  innovative \napproach  to  awareness  building,  identification  of  PFIs,  and  PFI  senior  management \ncommitment  of  their  SME  finance  business  plans,  before  assistance  packages  can  be \ncustomized. Since there is no standardized approach for delivery of such services and the tasks \nof  developing  systems,  lending  processes,  and  procedures  for  SME  finance  are  complex  and \nrequire  highly  specialized  skills  and  a  significant  degree  of  flexibility  in  the  allocation  of \nexpertise, the quality-based selection method will be applied for the capacity-building portion of \nthis component (308 person-months of which 124 months are international and 184 months are \ndomestic  expertise).  Since  the  participating  FIs  will  be  identified  in  the  awareness-building \nprocess  through  short-term  consultants,  the  requisite  terms  of  reference  and  specialized  skills \nwill  be  customized  to  the  needs  of  the  individual  PFI.  It  is  expected  that  four  PFIs  will  benefit \nfrom  the capacity-building measures. The short-term  positions  (32  person-months of which 16 \nmonths are international and 16 months are domestic expertise) will be advertised and selected \non an individual basis.  The experts will have a strong track record in emerging markets in the \nfollowing areas: (i) SME finance policy/regulation, (ii) awareness building and training, and (iii) \ndesign and implementation of downscaling programs for SME finance.  \n \nB. \n \n\nComponent 3.2: SME Bank Restructuring \n\nBackground and Rationale  \n\n1. \n \n13. \nOn 1 January 2002, the Government merged two failed DFIs, the Regional Development \nFinance  Corporation  and  the  Small  Business  Finance  Corporation,  into  SME  Bank,  a  public \nlimited company. The Government owns directly and indirectly approximately 97% of the bank. \nSince its creation, SME Bank has experienced operational losses, primarily due to (i) substantial \nfixed costs (i.e., overstaffing and too many branches), and (ii) lack of appropriate credit analysis \nand risk management skills necessary to run and operate a bank specializing in SME lending. \nSince  the  Government  believes  it  is  vital  for  the  development  of  the  private  sector  in  Pakistan \nthat SME Bank continues to provide term financing to SMEs, especially to the lower segment of \nthe  SME  market,  the  SME  Bank  has  recently  prepared  a  restructuring  plan  to  improve  its \nperformance. According to the restructuring plan, SME Bank\u2019s business will be reorganized into) \nan  SME  business  unit,  and  a  recovery  unit.  Additionally,  the  restructuring  plan  includes  (i)  a \ntime-bound  action  plan  to  reduce  the  number  of  bank  branches  and  rationalize  staff  of  the \nrecovery  unit  to  a  sustainable  cost  level;  and  (ii)  an  independent  human  resource  audit  to  (a) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6  53 \n\nevaluate the skills of the employees at the bank, (b) identify and match such skills for specific \njobs  within  the  bank,  (c)  identify  alternative  job  opportunities  for  certain  employees,  and  (d) \nprovide active job-search assistance and reemployment training for personnel. \n \n\n2. \n\nObjective and Scope  \n\n \n14. \nThis component will be implemented over 24 months and will assist the Government and \nSME Bank with the implementation of the restructuring plan, and provide expertise to (i) identify \nmarket niches for SME Bank, (ii) establish lending policies and procedures, (iii) develop financial \nproducts,  (iv)  develop  marketing  strategies  to  enhance  outreach,  and  (v)  develop  sound  risk \nmanagement  through  appropriate  incentives  for  staff,  controls,  and  sound  management \ninformation systems. SME Bank will recruit an individual international expert as head of its SME \nbusiness unit, who will lead for a 24-month period the buildup of the commercial SME business \nunit including the use of deposit and lending products for its clients. The expert will be selected \nin  a  competitive  process  by  a  committee  composed  of  SME  Bank  and  the  core  program \nmanagement  unit.  Recruitment  will  be  in  agreement  with  ADB  and  consistent  with  the \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  expert  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  and  a  final \nreport  at  the  end  of  the  task.  The  expert  will  have  (i)  at  least  8  years  experience  in  (a) \nestablishing  and  managing  SME  banking  for  commercial  FIs;  (b)  SME  credit  origination, \nmanagement,  and  risk  management;  and  (c)  analytical,  management,  marketing,  and \ninterpersonal skills; and (ii) the following responsibilities: \n \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n(h) \n(i) \n(j) \n(k) \n\nprepare strategy and business plan to establish and manage the SME business, \nconduct market research surveys to identify business potential, \ndevelop a marketing plan to develop the image of SME Bank, \nbased on the business plan develop products for SME finance, \nprepare a credit policy and risk management process for SME lending, \nestablish credit administration and risk management systems, \nassist in the recruitment and staff development for the new business unit, \ntrain the bank\u2019s senior management and the board of directors, \noversee the implementation of the capacity building/training program for staff, \nprovide on the job assistance to officers, lending and loan recovery, and \nsupervise SME business operations and performance. \n\n.\n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n \nItem \nA.

As described in Sections II B5. and III E. in the main text, the development of \nmarket-based products to enhance the channeling of existing liquidity of the financial system to \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  is  a  key  innovation  supported  under  the  Small  and \nMedium Enterprise Sector Development Program (SDP). \n \n2. \nObjective: Increase SME Lending. The objective of the partial credit guarantee (PCG) \nfacility  under  the  SDP  is  twofold:  first,  to  leverage  through  a  market-based approach existing \nfinancial resources of the financial system for lending to SMEs not currently served by financial \ninstitutions  (FIs);  second,  to  provide  catalytic  support  for  innovative  financial  products  and \napproaches  in  new  markets.  Once  successfully  tested  with  participating  financial  institutions \n(PFIs) at the initial stage, such products will be expanded among a larger number of FIs. The \nexpected outcome of the PCG facility is a higher volume of SME lending by commercial FIs.  \n \n3. \nA  Market-Based  Alternative  to  Traditional  Credit  Lines.  The  PCG  facility  aims  to \nprovide  a  market-based  and  more  sustainable  alternative  to  the  traditional  credit  lines.  Rather \nthan injecting additional liquidity into a market that is already highly liquid, the PCG facility aims \nto  channel  existing  sources  into  the  SME  sector  by  addressing  risk  allocation  concerns \nfundamental  to  the  FI\u2019s  lending  decisions.  Hence,  the  emphasis  of  the  PCG  facility  will  be  on \nenhancing access to credit, not reducing prices, which will be market determined. The design of \nthe PCG facility also largely avoids issues that are related to currency mismatches that arise in \nthe case of credit lines in foreign exchange. \n \nB. \n\nFacility Design \n\n1. \n\nStructure \n\n \n4. \nIdentifiable  Guarantee  Contracts  for  Sharing  of  Risk  and  Rewards.  Through  the \nPCG facility, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will share with PFIs the credit risk of selected \nSME loans in return for a fee. Within the  overall parameters of the PCG facility, ADB will issue \nspecific  PCGs  with  agreed  cover  amounts  and  time  frame  to  PFIs  in  Pakistan,  which  are \nselected  following  a  due  diligence  process.  The  PCGs  will  detail  the  risk-  and  reward-sharing \narrangements  for  individual  loans  within  a  defined  portfolio  of  loans  extended  by  the  PFIs  to \nSMEs.  The  loan  portfolio  covered  under  each  PCG  may  be  of  a  revolving  nature,  and  the \nportfolio composition may change over time based on lending decisions of the PFI within agreed \nparameters. ADB will not be involved in individual lending decisions by the PFIs, but will agree \nwith the PFIs the lending selection and risk management process. \n \n5. \nA Public-Private Partnership Anchored in the SDP. The PCG is anchored in the SDP, \nwhich  supports  measures  to  ensure  an  enabling  policy  and  institutional  environment for SME \nlending.  The  PCG  is  an  alternative  approach  to  traditional  credit  lines  in  overcoming  limited \naccess  to  credit  encountered  by  SMEs.  Hence,  the  integration  of  the  PCG  in  the  SME  SDP \nmakes this a genuine public-private partnership, providing support to the private sector to take \nadvantage  of  the  reforms  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  operations.  To  underscore  its \nmarket-based  approach,  the  PCG  facility  will  be  provided  through  ADB\u2019s  private  sector \noperations  without  counterguarantee  of  the  Government. Terms and conditions will be market \nbased. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n2. \n\nScope \n\n \n6. \nFixed Facility Amount with Flexible Sublimits for PFIs.  The PCG facility is proposed \nto have an overall limit of $65 million, which represents the maximum aggregate amount of all \nPCGs  outstanding  and  ADB\u2019s  maximum  exposure  under  the  PCG  facility.  The  PCGs  will  be \nissued  for  each  PFI  based  on  demand  and  prudent  practices,  starting  at  PCG  sublimits  with \nlower amounts that can be gradually increased within the overall PCG facility limit. To avoid a \nhigh  concentration  of  risks  to  any  single  PFI,  sublimits  will  initially  be  set  at  $20  million \nequivalent  for  each  PFI,  but  ceilings  may  be  adjusted  from  time  to  time  in  line  with  actual \nutilization, loss experience, and soundness of the PFI. The total size of the PCG facility can be \nincreased  at  a  later  stage  for  a  supplementary  amount,  based  on  experience  and  demand, \nsubject to a separate approval by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors at such time. \n \n7. \nComprehensive  Risk  Coverage.  The  proposed  PCG  facility  will,  under  each  PCG \nissued,  share  the  credit  risk  on  both  principal  and  interest  payments  for  individual  loans  in  a \nportfolio  of  eligible  SME  loans  issued  by  each  PFI,  based  on  the  lending  decision  by  the  PFI \nwithin  defined  risk  parameters.  The  determination  of  the  SME  loan  portfolio,  and  the  PFI\u2019s \napproach to SME lending, are the crucial parameters that determine risk exposure, and will be \nspecified in the guarantee agreement with each PFI following a due diligence process.  \n \nRisk  Sharing  with  PFIs.  Risk  sharing  with  PFIs  will  take  place  on  two  levels,  on  an \n8. \nindividual loan basis. First, a first loss limit will be defined that will  be fully absorbed by the PFI. \nThe first loss will be a function of the strength of the financial institution, its past SME lending \nhistory, and its risk management systems. The level of first loss may be fixed between 0% for \nstrong institutions with an established track record up to 30% for new market entrants. Second, \nany loss in excess of the first loss borne by the PFI will be at an agreed risk sharing percentage, \nnormally expected at 50% with the PFI.  \n \nPrudent  Phasing-in  and  Close  Monitoring.  Since  the  PCG  product  is  new  both  in \n9. \nPakistan and for ADB, the PCG facility will commence operation with commercial FIs that have \nwell-established  underwriting  procedures  of \ninternational  standard  and  demonstrated \nexperience in applying similar lending methodologies elsewhere, before expanding to domestic \nFIs. Likewise, the portfolio of eligible loans will expand gradually. The tenor of guaranteed loans \nwill be limited to 36 months, although initially the PCG may be targeted at shorter maturities. A \nbigger share of SMEs in the middle market (with turnover between PRs100 million and PRs300 \nmillion)  may  be  allowed,  following  a  prudent  approach.  Once  ADB  is  satisfied  with  the  track \nrecord of the PFI and its SME borrowers, portfolio targets may be revised to encourage PFIs to \nexpand further to smaller SMEs and expand tenors.  \n \n10. \nPCG  Limits  in  US  Dollars  for  Risks  Denominated  in  Local  Currency.  Guarantee \nlimits with PFIs will be in US dollar terms, but PFIs  are expected to extend loans to SMEs under \nthe PCG in local currency. Any risk as a result of currency fluctuations beyond the PCG limit for \neach PFI will be for the account of the PFI, since ADB\u2019s risk exposure will be capped with the \ndollar amount specified for each PFI under the guarantee agreement. \n \n11. \nFacility  Available  Until  End-2008.  The  availability  of  the  facility  is  about  5  years  from \nthe expected date of ADB approval, until 31 December 2008. During this period, PCGs can be \nissued by ADB and adjusted until the final facility date, which may be up to 31 December 2011.1 \nUpon  expiration  of  the  facility  availability  period  on  31  December  2008,  all  outstanding  loans \n\n                                                 \n1  If a 36-month loan was issued under a PCG on the last availability day of the facility,  the exposure for ADB would \n\nbe until 31 December 2011. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9  65 \n\ncovered under the PCGs will remain covered until they fall due, but no new loans or renewals of \nexisting loans will be covered by the PCGs.  \n \n\n3. \n\nEligibility and Selection of Loans \n\n \n12. \nTargeted SME Profile. Typical SMEs targeted under the facility would be suppliers and \nvendors  of  and  to  larger  corporate  clients  of  the  PFIs,  in  nontraditional  industries  that  have \nreasonably  established  and  integrated  supply  chain  structures  in  Pakistan,  such  as  the \npharmaceutical,  automobile,  engineering,  and  consumer  goods  industries.  For  example,  large \ncorporate entities in the pharmaceutical industry provide their products to about 200 pharmacies \nin Karachi alone. Many of these pharmacies have an annual business turnover of about PRs50 \nmillion  to  PRs150  million,  but  currently  face  large  constraints  in  accessing  working  capital. \nLarger  pharmacies,  wholesale  distributors,  and  hospitals  usually  do  not  have  difficulty  in \naccessing credit from FIs.  \n \n13. \nRelationship Between PFIs and SMEs. It is envisaged that most SMEs inc luded in the \nguaranteed  loan  portfolio  will  not  have  a  borrowing  relationship  with  the  PFI  prior  to  the  PCG \nagreement.  The  relation  between  the  PFI  and  the  SME  may  be  established  either  through  (i) \nconfirmation  of  the  PFI\u2019s  corporate  client  that  the  SME  is  one  of  its  suppliers,  vendors,  or \nestablished  clients;  or  (ii)  a  guarantee  of  the  corporate  client  on  behalf  of  the  SME.  Existing \nSME clients of the PFI may also be included if this entails an increase in their credit limit. Direct \nrelationships of PFIs with SME clients are also encouraged within an agreed lending approach. \n \n14. \nwith the following borrower characteristics: \n \n\nEligibility  of  SMEs.  PCGs  issued  to  PFIs  will  be  limited  to  coverage  of  loan  portfolios \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nSMEs with an annual business turnover of up to PRs300 million will be eligible to \nreceive loans covered by the PCG (in line with the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s SME \nregulations); \nnew SME borrowers are eligible, or additional credit limits to existing SMEs; \nSMEs  must  have  2  years  minimum  period  of  profitable  operation,  and  no \nnegative credit history; \npricing of covered loans is market based; \nSME\u2019s  operating  in  any  business  listed  in  a  specified  negative  list  will  not  be \neligible;2 \nSMEs meet credit policies and procedures established by the PFI and acceptable \nto ADB; and  \n\n(vii)  SMEs maintain a good credit track record throughout the duration of the PCG. \n \n15. \nFlexibility  to  Fine-Tune  Targeting.  SME  characteristics  may  be  revised  based  on \nactual  experience  and  the  eligibility  thresholds  under  the  facility  may  be  adjusted  by  ADB,  in \nconsultation with the PFIs, to better target smaller SMEs. \n \n\n4. \n\nEligibility and Selection of Participating Financial Institutions \n\n \n16. \nAll Private Sector and Financially Sound FIs in Pakistan. All licensed and financially \nsound FIs in Pakistan established in the private sector are eligible, in principle, for a PCG under \nthe facility. All PFIs will demonstrate in a business plan their intention to move from the existing \n\n                                                 \n2  In  addition  to  the  items  listed  in  the  negative  list  attached  in  Supplementary  Appendix  1,  SMEs  involved  in \nproduction  processes,  which  are  environmentally  hazardous  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  environment  policy,  are  not \neligible  for  the  PCG  cover.  It  also  excludes  construction  activities  involving  resettlement,  and  procurement  from \nADB non-member countries.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ncustomers to smaller customers over time. This entails a starting point of SMEs with a business \nturnover of PRs 300 million and a gradual lowering of the business turnover and loan sizes for \nindividual  customers.  The  review  process  will  evaluate  the  PFIs\u2019  performance  against  the \nagreed  targets.  A  due  diligence  process  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB  for  each  potential  FI,  to \ndetermine  the  likely  outreach  of  the  PFIs  to  SMEs,  and  the  PFI\u2019s  financial  soundness, \nmanagement,  and  risk  management  quality.  Each  potential  PFI  must  demonstrate  sound \nmanagement  track  record  in  managing  credit  risk  over  the  last  3  years,  and  uninterrupted \naccess  to  liquidity  to  finance  the  business.  Capital  at  risk  defined  as  past  dues  exceeding  90 \ndays may not exceed a certain percentage of the total outstanding portfolio, as defined in line \nwith prudent banking practice. Rescheduled loans will be reported separately.  \n \n17. \nDue Diligence Process. The due diligence process will include (i) a review of the PFI\u2019s \nbusiness  plans  (demonstrating  the  gradual  move  down  market  to  smaller  customers),  and \nidentification of the target SME portfolio and the expected uptake of loans; (ii) assessment of the \nPFI\u2019s  soundness  in  underwriting  loans  and  managing  credit  risk,  especially  in  the  targeted \nsegment;  (iii)  determination  of  lending  and  risk  parameters;  (iv)  analysis  of  the  PFI\u2019s \nenvironmental  policy  and  its  incorporation  in  the  lending  and  risk  management  process;  (v) \ndescription  of  the  PFI  staff\u2019s  accountability  for  environmental  concerns  in  the  loan  origination \nand  management  process;  (vi)  capability  of  the  management  and  staff  dealing  with \nenvironmental assessment (proposed remedies as necessary), determination of the first loss to \nbe borne by the PFI, and of a risk sharing rate for the credit risks beyond the first loss; and (vii) \ndescription  of  the  monitoring,  reporting,  and  semiannual  review  process  on  the  utilization, \ncompliance  with  meeting  SME  lending  targets,  environmental  and  other  safeguards,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  PCG  facility.  In  light  of  the  above,  the  PCG  amount  for \neach PFI will initially be determined and will reviewed semiannually and adjusted as necessary. \n \n18. \nStart with Established International FIs. ADB has to date (November 2003) developed \nthe detailed PCG product design and performed due diligence on the SME credit selection and \nrisk management processes of two international FIs operating in Pakistan, namely Citibank and \nStandard Chartered Bank. ADB found them to be financially sound, with well-established credit \nmanagement systems, although they adopted different approaches to SME lending. Once initial \nexperience has been gained, domestic FIs are expected to follow. This process must be gradual \nand  driven  by  demand,  since  supply-induced  efforts  to  increase  outreach  have  proven \nunsustainable. Under the SME SDP, domestic FIs will have access to support in upgrading their \nbusiness  processes  and  products  to  serve  SMEs.  It  is  expected  that  successful completion of \nthe capacity building will help identify domestic FIs that may qualify as PFIs under the facility. \n \n\n5. \n\nPricing \n\n \n19.  Market-Based Profit Sharing. The PFI will pay to ADB a predetermined fee either as a \nfixed  rate  based  on  the  PFIs  profit  in  lending  to  SMEs  in  the  agreed  portfolio  and  reviewed \nsemiannually, or as a variable rate reflecting the PFIs profit as documented in the PFIs financial \nstatements.  The  fee  will  be  market  based  and  determined  for  each  PFI  based  on  the  risks \nidentified  during  the  due  diligence  process  and  the  risk  sharing  mechanism  agreed  between \nADB  and  the  PFI,  as  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee  Committee  chaired  by  the  Office  of \nCofinancing Operations. In accordance with market practice front-end fees will not be charged \nto the PFIs. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nLegally  Binding  Guarantee  Agreement.  ADB  will  enter  into  a  PCG  agreement  with \neach  PFI,  which  governs  all  aspects  of  the  PCG.  This  will  define  the  portfolio  loans  to  be \n\nImplementation and Monitoring of the Partial Credit Guarantee Facility  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9  67 \n\ncovered (including the PFI\u2019s SME target benchmarks in terms of SME outreach, such business \nturnover, number of loans, loan tenors, and credit volume), scope of cover and determination of \nloss,  loss  and  revenue-sharing  rates  on  the  defined  loan  portfolio,  claims  and  recovery \nprocedures, as well as other relevant aspects. \n \n21. \nStandardized  PCG  Contracts  with  Customized  Terms  and  Conditions. Guarantee \nagreements  with  PFIs  will  follow  a  standardized  format  and  outline.  However,  because  each \npotential PFI differs in the (i) approach to access the SME market and (ii) quality of the lending \nprocess,  the  conditions  of  the  PCG  will  be  determined  on  a  case-by-case basis based  on the \ndue diligence of the FI and its SME lending processes and operations. Terms and conditions for \neach  PCG  will  be  detailed  in  a  term  sheet  in  line  with  the  parameters  described  in  this  RRP, \nsubject  to  review  by  ADB\u2019s  Guarantee  Committee  and  procedures  detailed  in  a  Guarantee \nAdministration Memorandum (GAM) prior to its finalization. \n \n22. \nPerformance  Reviews  and  Monitoring.  Each  guarantee  agreement  will  detail  the \nrequirement  for  quarterly  performance  reporting  and  as  well  as  prompt  information  on  any \npotential  losses  or  defaults  in  the  portfolio.  ADB  will  monitor  the  utilization  of  the  PCG  facility \nincluding its developmental and environmental impacts through semiannual on-site review of the \nPFIs exposure to SMEs, especially the portfolio quality underwritten by the PFIs and the PFIs\u2019 \nmeeting of agreed business targets of providing credit to additional lower segments of SMEs as \nreflected in the agreed business plans.  Based on the semiannual reviews, ADB has the option \nto  modify  existing  guarantee  parameters,  with  adequate  notice,  or  suspend  new  SME  loan \ninclusions under the guaranteed portfolio. \n \nGuarantee Administration Memorandum. A GAM will be prepared by the South Asia \n23. \nDepartment.  The  GAM  will  set  out  the  respective  responsibilities  of  ADB  departments \nconcerned  (Office  of  Cofinancing  Operations;  Office  of  the  General  Counsel;  Regional  and \nSustainable  Development  Department;  Pakistan  Resident  Mission;  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment;  and  Governance,  Finance  and  Trade  Division,  South  Asia  Department)  in  the \nselection  of  PFIs  and  management  of  the  facility,  including  developmental  and  commercial \naspects, and the establishment of an environment management system as prescribed in ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy. Reporting requirements and information to be provided by the PFIs will also \nbe detailed in the PCG agreements. \n \nD. \n\nLoss Determination, Claims Payment, and Loss Adjustment \n\nLoss Determination. Risks guaranteed under each PCG are losses, in accordance with \n24. \nthe  agreed  loss-sharing  ratios,  that  result  from  irrecoverable  principal  and  interest  payment \ndefault on SME loans included in the guaranteed loan portfolio. Losses are determined by the \nPFI  in  a  transparent  manner,  which  will  include  appropriate  documentation  that  there  is  a \nnonpayment of an amount due under a loan included in the guaranteed SME portfolio, and such \nnonpayment  continues  for  a  period  to  be  determined  individually  for  each  PFI,  net  of  any \nrecoveries  that  may  have  been  realized  since  initial  loss  identification  or  provisioning.  To \nsubstantiate a claim, the PFI has to demonstrate: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nsubstantial  recovery  efforts  as  soon  as  the  loan  is  classified  below  \u201cnormal\u201d, \nincluding acceleration of repayments and collection from guarantors, if any, and  \nthat  the  PFI  has  met  and  continues  to  meet  its  obligations  under  the  PCG \nthrough: \n(a) \n\nimmediate  notification  of  ADB  at  the  end  of  the  month,  when  the  loan  is \nclassified below \u201cnormal\u201d; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\nsubmission of monthly reports on the whole relationship account with the \nborrower,  advising  ADB  on  the  collection  and  provisioning  status  and \nrecovery efforts;  \nrestructuring  of  loans  to  ensure  repayment  of  the  principal  and  interest; \nand \ninitiating legal proceedings for liquidation of collateral and securities held \nto offset interest and principal. \n\n \nClaims Payment. ADB will reimburse the PFI for the guaranteed percentage of losses \n25. \narising  from  guaranteed  risks  in  excess  of  the  first  loss,  after  the  receipt  of  a  valid  claim \nproviding satisfactory evidence of the PFI\u2019s right to compensation in the amount claimed net of \nlegal expenses. Claims will be paid in the currency in which the loss has arisen, subject to the \nUS dollar limit of the PCG for that PFI, based on an agreed reference rate of exchange.  \n \n26. \nLoss  Adjustments.  If  the  PFI  recovers  any  credit  loss  after  having  received  a \nguaranteed  payment  from  ADB  under  the  PCG,  that  recovered  amount  will  be  applied  to  the \ncredit  loss  amount  on  a  pro  rata  basis  between  ADB  and  the  PFI,  net  of  agreed  external \nrecovery expenses, for reimbursement to ADB.  \n \nE. \n\nCompliance with ADB Safeguard Policies: Environment, Resettlement, and \nIndigenous Peoples  \n\n27. \nSafeguard Policies.  The  PCG  facility  is  classified  as  \u201cFinancial  Intermediary\u201d  for  the \npurpose  of  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies.  ADB  will  establish  an  environment \nmanagement  system,  which  will  be  detailed  in  the  GAM  and  specified  for  each  PFI  under the \nguarantee  agreement  to  ensure  PFIs\u2019  adherence  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  as  well  as  to  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  GAM  will  also  require  PFIs  under  the  guarantee \nagreements  to  acknowledge  in  progress  reports  that  all  borrowers  comply  with  health,  safety, \nand  environmental  regulations  and  standards  as  well  as  public  consultation  requirements \napplicable  in  Pakistan.  Since  the  PFIs\u2019  loans  to  SMEs  will  be  largely  in  the  trade  and  light-\nmanufacturing  sector,  it  is  unlikely  that  involuntary  resettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on \nindigenous  peoples  will  occur.  As  for  environmental  safeguards,  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  will \nidentify areas for remedy, including negative lists and training as necessary. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10  69 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT FOR SUPPORTING COORDINATION OF THE SMALL \nAND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\n \n1. \nRationale.
