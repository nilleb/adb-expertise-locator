Since \n16 March 2020, wide-ranging social distancing and containment measures have been instituted\u2014\nincluding  the  suspension  of  all  international  and  domestic  travel,  the  closure  of  nonessential \nbusinesses  and  educational  institutions,  and  compulsory  work  from  home  for  nonessential \nservices. 2 These  measures  have  negatively  affected  the  economy,  with  real  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth dropping to 1.5% in 2020 from a forecast of 6% before the pandemic.3 The \ndownturn  in  global  trade  and  lower  demand  and  prices  for  commodity  exports  will  widen  the \ncurrent account deficit to 9.6% of GDP in 2020 from an earlier forecast of 4.7%. The nationwide \nlockdown  has  led  to  80%  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  suspending  their \nactivities. About $700 million of tourism revenues will be lost in 2020. The expected 40% decline \nin remittance inflows in 2020 will adversely impact the low-income families. The unemployment \nrate is projected to rise to 16.5% in 2020 from 9.4% in 2019. An additional 448,000 people are \nexpected to fall into poverty. The widening of the fiscal deficit to 5.6% of GDP in 2020 (from an \nearlier forecast of 2.7%) has increased the urgent near-term financing needs. \n \n3. \nThe program will provide critical budget support to enable the government to undertake \ncountercyclical expenditures to (i) strengthen the health system capacity to combat the spread of \nCOVID-19; (ii) support businesses, employment, and job-creating regional public works; and (iii) \nexpand  social  safety  nets.  Uzbekistan  meets  all  the  criteria  required  to  access  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  CPRO  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility,  including  robust \nmacroeconomic management, undertaking of key structural reforms, a pro-poor countercyclical \nexpenditure  program,  and  public  debt  levels  maintained  at  sustainable  levels  (Table  1).4 The \nprogram is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (para. 21).5 \n\n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  \n\n \nAccess Criteria \n1.  Adverse impact of \nexogenous shocks \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nAs of 15 June 2020, 5,080 COVID-19 cases were reported with 19 deaths. The real GDP \ngrowth forecast for 2020 has been reduced from 6% to 1.5%, and an estimated 448,000 \nadditional people are expected to fall into poverty. The unemployment rate is projected to \nrise to 16.5% in 2020 from 9.4% in 2019. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 5.6% \nof GDP in 2020 against an earlier estimate of 2.7%. Budget revenues are expected to fall \nto 25.2% of GDP in 2020 compared with 28.6% of GDP in 2019. The currency depreciated \nby 6.7% against the United States dollar from 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020. The CBU \nlowered its benchmark interest rate from 16% to 15%. \nUnder  Presidential  Decrees  No.  5969,  No.  5978  and  No.  5996,  the  government  has \nestablished  the  ACF  totaling  SUM10  trillion  under  the  budget  and  undertaken \ncountercyclical expenditures to strengthen the health sector, stabilize economic activity, \n\n2.

Manila. \n2  From mid-May 2020, differentiated containment measures began to be applied in cities and regions with color-coded \nzoning based on the spread of the disease, and partial restoration of domestic air and rail travel. The social distancing \nmeasures, currently in effect until 1 August 2020, could be extended depending on the evolving COVID-19 situation. \nFrom 15 June 2020 onwards, flights from countries with stable epidemiological situations will be resumed. \n\n3  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n4  Details on compliance with the access criteria are in Appendix 4. \n5  ADB. 2018.

Structural reforms \n\nof \nsound \nmacroeconomic \nmanagement \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nand expand social protection for the poor and vulnerable groups. These measures (paras. \n12\u201316) constitute the government\u2019s COVID-19 pandemic response plan.  \nUzbekistan  has  a  strong  record  of  sound  macroeconomic  management,  achieving \naverage  GDP  growth  of  6.8%  during  2010\u20132019,  driven  by  growth  in  industry  and \nservices,  the  private  sector,  commodity  exports,  and  foreign  investment.  The  national \npoverty rate declined from 25.8% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2018. A conservative fiscal and \ndebt policy has led to a low risk of debt stress. Structural reforms, including exchange \nrate  liberalization,  have  been  implemented  since  2017.  Under  the  inflation  targeting \nregime, inflation has slowed from 17.5% in 2018 to 14.5% in 2019 and 12.9% in 2020.  \nThe Special Republican Commission was set up on 29 January 2020, followed by the \nRepublican  Anti-Crisis  Commission  on  19  March  2020,  to  oversee  the  pandemic \nresponse.  Strict  containment  measures  were  instituted.  A  COVID-19  SPRP  was \noperationalized  with  WHO  support.  The  government  has  undertaken  a  credible \ncountercyclical response, including social protection measures. Coordinated support from \ndevelopment  partners  has  been  mobilized.  The  government  remains  committed  to \nstructural reforms to strengthen macroeconomic management. \n5.  Debt sustainability  ADB\u2019s DSAa shows a low risk of debt stress. The budget support loans for COVID-19 will \nincrease the outstanding public debt stock by 13.7% (6.1% from ADB and 7.6% from the \nIMF and the World Bank). The public debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to increase from 23.3% \nin 2019 to 33.3% by 2021 but will remain below the  required threshold of 70% for low \ndebt  stress  and  will  not  impair  debt  sustainability.  The  IMF  Assessment  Letter  and  its \nDSA also confirm the low risk of debt stress. \nThe program was developed in close coordination and consultation with the IMF.  ADB \nand the government have consulted closely with the IMF on the country\u2019s macroeconomic \noutlook, especially related to the impact of COVID-19. IMF provided its assessment letter \nto ADB on 14 April 2020.  \n\nthe International \nMonetary Fund \n\n6.

Uzbekistan\u2019s  health  care  system  has  not  handled  a  pandemic  or \nhealth  crisis  of  this  nature  or  scale  since  independence.  On  11 March  2020, the  World  Health \nOrganization  (WHO)  declared  the  COVID-19  outbreak  a  pandemic  with  serious  worldwide \nimplications.6 Since the diagnosis of the first COVID-19 case in Uzbekistan on 15 March 2020, \n5,080  cases  have  been  reported,  corresponding  to  150  cases  per  million  population  with  19 \ndeaths as of 15 June 2020. Although the country has made improvements over the years,7 the \ngrowing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has placed a strain on the health care system, \nwith  the  initial  diagnosis,  prevention,  and  treatment  capacity  constrained  by  shortages  of \nspecialized  medical  staff,  facilities,  and  medical  equipment. 8  Even  before  the  strict  social \ndistancing  measures  were  initiated,  a  Special  Republican  Commission  headed  by  the  Prime \n\n \n\n6   A United Nations resolution of 20 April 2020 calls for international cooperation to combat the pandemic. \n7   Uzbekistan has  a  centralized health care  system  under  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH),  with  universal coverage  of \ncitizens  for  a  basic  benefit  package.  Public  health  spending  totaled  11.3%  of  the  state  budget  in  2020.  In  2016, \nUzbekistan  had  6,542  outpatient  medical  institutions,  of  which  914  were  in  Tashkent,  and  1,106  hospitals  with \n132,000 beds (41.1 per 10,000 population).  In 2016, it had 84,100 physicians (382.1 persons per physician) and \n341,300  paramedical  personnel  (341.3  persons  per  paramedical  worker)  (State  Committee  on  Statistics.  2017. \nHealth Care System in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Tashkent). In 2018, number of hospitals increased to 1,165 while \nnumber of physicians increased to 89,700. The Healthcare Access and Quality Index measured by the Institute of \nHealth Metrics and Evaluation improved from 50.3 in 1990 to 62.9 in 2016.  \n\n8   In April 2020, WHO reported more than 85,000 persons in quarantine, with 17,000 held in official quarantine sites.  \n\n \n\n\fMinister  was  set  up  on  29  January  2020  (Presidential  Decree  No.  5537)  to  (i)  monitor  the \npandemic and raise public awareness,9 (ii) communicate with international organizations, and (iii) \nprocure  medicines  and  equipment  to  increase  the  health  system  preparedness  and  lower  the \nspread rate of the virus.   \n \n5. \nEconomy.  The  sharp  contraction  in  global  economic  activity  has  severe  economic \nconsequences  for  Uzbekistan. 10  The  pandemic  has  delivered  a  large  external  shock  to \nUzbekistan\u2019s  economy, with  real GDP  growth  projections falling  to  1.5% in 2020  from the  pre-\nCOVID-19 forecast of 6% (Figure). The economic impact and the knock-on effects on low-income \nhouseholds have been driven by the magnitude and duration of (i) the downturn in Uzbekistan\u2019s \nmain  trade  and  investment  partners;  (ii)  the  fall  in  tourism  revenues;  (iii)  domestic  business \ndisruptions, particularly SMEs; (iv) the contraction in remittance inflows; and (v) the widening fiscal \ndeficit.  The  severity  of the  impact  through these  transmission  channels  is  compounded  by the \nrisks from a second wave of COVID-19.11 Real private final consumption growth is projected to \ndecline  from  6.3%  in  2019  to  0.3%  in  2020.  Real  growth  in  gross  fixed  capital  formation  is \nprojected to decline to 4.5% in 2020 from 46.0% in 2019. In 2020, real sector growth is projected \nat  2.1%  for  industry  (8.9%  in  2019)  and  0.6%  for  services  (5.5%  in  2019),  while  growth  in \nagriculture will remain stable at 2.6% (2.5% in 2019).  \n \n\nFigure: Growth of GDP, Private Consumption and Gross Fixed Capital Formation  \nAnnual change (%) \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, est. = estimate, GDP = gross domestic product, proj. = projection. \nNote: Growth of gross fixed capital formation is on the y-axis of the right-hand side. \nSource: Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n6. \nTrade and investment. The trade and investment flows have contracted with the severe \ndownturn in key trade and investment partners. About 40% of Uzbekistan\u2019s trade is concentrated \n\n \n\n9   The  government  established  a  dedicated  coronavirus  website,  providing  press  briefings  about  the  government\u2019s \n\npandemic response. A dedicated call center was also set up at MOH. \n\n10 Based on IMF estimates, the global GDP is projected to contract by 3% in 2020\u2014worse than the 2008\u20132009 financial \ncrisis\u2014against 2.9% growth in 2019. Risk aversion has increased, reflected in the falling oil and commodity prices, \nbond  and  equity  prices,  and  surging  gold  price  (IMF.  2020.  World  Economic  Outlook:  Chapter  1\u2014The  Great \nLockdown. Washington, D.C.). The latest ADB projections estimate a global contraction in the range of 4.5%-5.9% \nunder  various  containment  scenarios,  incorporating  the  impact  of  macroeconomic  responses  (ADB.  2020.  An \nUpdated Assessment of the Economic Impact of COVID-19. ADB Briefs No. 133. May. Manila). \n\n11 The growth projections are under the best-case scenario of bringing the pandemic under control within 6 months in \nthe second half of 2020 and the normalization of economic activity thereafter. Under the worst-case scenario, the \nrisks  of  a  second  wave  of  infections  are  present  once  the  containment  is  relaxed,  resulting  in  prolonged  global \nrecession, coupled with heightened instability in public finances and the banking industry.

Merchandise imports, which grew at 16.2% in 2019, are projected to contract by \n6.7%. 13 The current account deficit is projected to deepen from 5.6% in 2019 to 9.6% in 2020, \nagainst the pre-COVID-19 estimate of 4.7% in 2020.14 Net foreign direct investment is projected \nto fall to 1.2% of GDP in 2020 from 3.9% of GDP in 2019.15 Uzbekistan has been insulated from \nthe sell-off in global financial markets due to low portfolio investment in its underdeveloped capital \nmarkets and limited exposure to world financial markets.16 The foreign exchange reserves ($30.5 \nbillion  as  of  March  2020),  with  56.7%  held  in  gold  ($17.3  billion),  and  rising  gold  prices  have \nprovided a cushion against the pressures for depreciation. Uzbekistan\u2019s currency (sum) declined \nby 6.7% against the United States dollar from 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020 compared with \ndepreciation of more than 10% for the Russian ruble, Kazakh tenge, and Kyrgyz som. \n \n7. \nTourism.  Tourist  arrivals  and  revenues  will  fall  sharply  in  this  key  growth  sector.  The \nnumber of visitors to Uzbekistan increased from about 1 million in 2016 to more than 6.4 million \nin 2018 and nearly 4.9 million in the first 9 months of 2019. This number of visitors was expected \nto rise to more than 7 million by 2025, with annual foreign currency earnings reaching $2 billion. \nThe direct and indirect economic activity arising from tourism and travel related services reached \nabout 4% of GDP in 2019.17 In the first quarter of 2020, tourist arrivals to Uzbekistan fell by 12% \nand tourism revenues are expected to decline by $700 million in 2020.  \n \n8. \nSmall  and  medium-sized  enterprises.  With  sales  at  a  standstill  and  cash  reserves \ndepleted, SMEs have been hit hard. SMEs have been growing in Uzbekistan, providing 56.5% of \nGDP in 2019 and contributing 35% of industry, 84% of retail trade, and 52% of services. In 2019, \nSMEs\u2019  share  of  exports  was  28.7%,  their  share  of  imports  was  54.2%,  and  their  share  of \ninvestment was 47%.18 SMEs account for 37% of formal sector employment and 78% of formal \nand  informal  employment  combined.  As  of  end  April  2020,  13,000  public  catering  enterprises, \n45,000  retail  enterprises,  19,000  service  enterprises,  and  7,000  transport  enterprises  have \nstopped operating and/or lost significant revenue. About 80% of individual entrepreneurs have \nsuspended their activities. Job losses caused by business closures carry the risk of large-scale \nunemployment, leading to reduced incomes and even social distress. \n \n9. \nRemittances.  Slowdowns  in  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan  are  projected  to \nresult in a 40% fall in remittance inflows in 2020 compared with 2019. 19 About 13% (2.5 million) \nof  Uzbekistan\u2019s  working-age  population  works  abroad,  with  85%  in  the  Russian Federation. \n\n \n\n12 Based on IMF estimates (footnote 10), the PRC is projected to grow at 1.2% in 2020. With double shocks from the \noil price collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Kazakhstan\u2019s GDP is projected to contract by 2.5% and the \nRussian Federation\u2019s GDP is projected to contract by 5.5% in 2020.    \n\n13 Gold exports constituted 38.2% of $2.6 billion of exports in March 2020, followed by industrial products (18.4%) and \nservices  (17.6%).  Other  commodity  exports\u2014natural  gas,  cotton,  and  copper\u2014have  been  affected  by  the  fall  in \ndemand  and  prices.  Of  imports  totaling  $3.3  billion,  machinery,  transport,  equipment,  and  industrial  products \nconstituted 52.9% and were affected by supply chain disruptions (Government of Uzbekistan,  Ministry of Finance \n(MOF). 2020. Newsletter No. 10. March). \n\n14 Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 The PRC, the Russian Federation, and Germany provided 34% of the $2.3 billion of foreign direct investment in 2019. \n16 Uzbekistan issued its first Eurobond ($1 billion) in February 2019. This was followed by a $300 million corporate \n\nissuance by the state-owned Industrial and Construction Bank (JSCB Uzpromstroybank) in November 2019. \n\n17 World Bank. 2020.

Socio-economic  Situation  of  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan. Chapter 8: Small Business. Tashkent. As of 1 April 2020, Uzbekistan had 352,167 registered and active \nSMEs\u201424% higher than the number as of 1 March 2019. \n\n19 IMF projections show that gross remittance inflows to GDP ratio declines from 15% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020.  \n\n \n\n\fBased  on  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU)  data,  of  the  net  remittance  inflows,  which \naveraged $5.11 billion in 2018, $3.96 billion was received from the Russian Federation and $320 \nmillion from Kazakhstan. A recent World Bank survey shows that the share of households with \nmembers  working  abroad  fell  to  13%  in  April  2020  from  17%  in  April  2019.  Among  those  still \nabroad,  active  employment  fell  to  73%  of  migrants  in  April  2020  from  88%  in  April  2019.  The \nmedian remittance transfers also fell by 21%.20 \n \n10. \nPoverty.  Without  social  and  economic  support  during  the  pandemic,  the  growing  job \nlosses, including for women, could reverse the gains made in poverty reduction since 2005.21 The \nWorld Bank estimates that an additional 448,000 people could fall into poverty, and the poverty \nrate (based on $3.20 per person per day in purchasing power parity terms) could increase to 8.7% \nin 2020 against the pre-COVID-19 projection of 7.4%.22 With 150,000 returning migrant workers \nand job losses from business closures, the unemployment rate is projected to increase to 16.5% \nin 2020 (from 9.4% in 2019 and against the pre-COVID-19 projection of 8.9% for 2020). 23 The \nMinistry of Employment and Labor Relations estimated that the number of unemployed citizens \n(including returning migrant workers) had reached more than 1.5 million as of 17 April 2020. From \nMarch to April 2020, the share of households with at least one member working fell from 85% to \n43% (footnote 20). Unemployment will be higher in the informal economy, which accounted for \n58%  of  total  employment  in  2019.  Economic  hubs  in  the  Ferghana,  Andijan,  Namangan,  and \nSamarkand  regions  lead  in  informal  employment.  The  fall  in  remittances  will  contribute  to \nincreased poverty for low-income households.24 The median per capita income combined from all \nsources fell by 38% in April 2020 against March 2020, with a decline of 46% in urban areas and \n37% in rural areas. Declines in income have been largest among the self-employed (67%). The \nshare  of  people  unable  to  afford  their  basic  needs  was  12%,  and  people  reporting  reduced \nhousehold food consumption reached 26% in April 2020. Women\u2019s job prospects will be severely \naffected  since they  comprise  about  45%  of formal  employees.  Their  share in SME employees \nreached 22.5% in 2016. In 2017, 43.2% of SMEs were managed and/or owned by women, with \none-third of new businesses registered by women entrepreneurs.25 The pandemic has wiped out \ntourism and high-value horticulture exports, which affect women as they comprise 54% of workers \nin catering and trade and tourism, and 46% in agriculture and forestry.     \n \n11. \nFiscal pressure. The pandemic is creating significant fiscal pressure. Budget revenues \nare expected to decline to SUM151.4 trillion (25.2% of GDP) in 2020 against the pre-COVID-19 \nestimate  of  SUM159.0  trillion,  driven  by  fall  in  taxes.26 Budget  expenditures  are  expected  to \nincrease to SUM172.3 trillion (28.6% of GDP) in 2020 against the earlier estimate of SUM162.4 \ntrillion, driven by health and social expenditures and countercyclical spending. The IMF projects \nthe overall fiscal deficit to be SUM33.8 trillion ($3.41 billion or 5.6% of GDP) in 2020 against the \npre-COVID-19 estimate of SUM17.8 trillion ($1.86 billion or 2.7% of GDP). \n \n\n \n\n20 These figures are based on a survey of 1,500 households, qualitative data, and focus groups discussions.

The government has increased its health sector support. On \n19 March 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) launched  the COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness \nand Response Plan (SPRP), prepared with WHO support, as a framework document for effective \npandemic management.28 In addition to the existing health expenditures under the budget, the \ngovernment has allocated SUM1 trillion ($104.6 million) from the ACF to (i) support the Agency \nfor  Sanitary  and  Epidemiological  Wellbeing  and  its  regional  centers;  (ii)  prepare  hospitals  and \nquarantine  complexes  with  the  required  equipment,  staff,  and  vehicles;  and  (iii)  supplement \nsalaries with hazard pay (equivalent to a daily supplement of 6% of salaries) for 15,000 medical \nstaff who are directly affected by COVID-19. Two COVID-19 hospitals\u2014one with 20,800 beds in \n\nPresidential Decree No. 5996 \n\n \n\n27 19  March  2020.  Presidential  Decree  No.  5969;  3  April  2020.  Presidential  Decree  No.5978  and  18  May  2020. \n\n28 The SPRP covers protocols on (i) pandemic risk management; (ii) emergency risk communication and community \nengagement;  (iii)  medical  systems  for  the  identification,  monitoring,  and  control  of  infectious  disease;  and \n(iv) mitigation of the socioeconomic impact. The WHO\u2019s technical assistance supports implementation of the SPRP, \nincluding training MOH in case management, contact tracing, laboratory and COVID-19 test kits, infection prevention, \nCOVID-19 data collection, and COVID-19 related procurement specifications. \n\n \n\n\fthe  Upper  Chirchik  District  and  another  with  10,000  beds  in  the  Zangiata  District  of  Tashkent \nregion\u2014have been prepared. Modular hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and quarantine stations \nwith capacity of 1,000 people each have been prepared in Surkhandarya, Namangan, and Navoi \nregions,  along  with  14  regional  hospitals  and  216  institutions  for  epidemiological  surveillance. \nMedicine and medical equipment imports are exempted from tax. The MOH has purchased testing \nkits  and  1,796  ventilators,  including  800  ventilators  procured  with  ADB  support.  It  has  set  up \nmobile laboratories in high-risk areas, and the production of medical masks has been increased \nto 5 million pieces a day. More than 250,000 tests were conducted as of 28 April 2020, with plans \nto conduct 400,000 until 1 September 2020. WHO, ADB, the World Bank, and the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) have supported the procurement of medical equipment and \nthe  capacity  building  of  medical  staff,  including  online  training.  The  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) countries, among others, have provided bilateral support. The \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency supplied diagnostic test systems to the Scientific Research \nInstitute of Virology. New health technical schools will also be opened. \n \n14.  Measures  to  support  businesses  and  employment.  The  government  has  rolled  out \nwide-ranging measures and the ACF includes an allocation of SUM8.3 trillion ($868.5 million) for \nthe following fiscal measures: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nTax measures. The social contributions tax for individual entrepreneurs has been \nreduced by 50% (from 12% to 6%) from 1 April to 1 October 2020. Payments of \npersonal income tax, and social tax for individual entrepreneurs and SMEs, have \nbeen  suspended  with  interest-free  deferment  until  1  October  2020.29 SMEs  and \nbusinesses  in  services,  transportation,  tourism  and  aviation  are  exempted  from \nproperty and land taxes and will pay a reduced social contributions tax (1% instead \nof 12%). The State Tax Committee will suspend tax audits until 1 January 2021. \nThe  filing  of  personal  income  tax  declarations  for  fiscal  year  2019  has  been \npostponed  from  1  April  2020  to  1  August  2020.  Local  governments  will  reduce \ntaxes by 30%, provide a 6-month grace period for paying property and land taxes \nand fees for water use, and suspend the accrual of tourist (hotel) tax from April \nuntil  October  2020.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  compensate  the  loss  of \nrevenue to local governments. The tax rate for water use on agricultural irrigated \nland  was reduced  by  50%.  The  deadlines  for  audit  reports  are  extended  until  1 \nOctober 2020. These measures will cost SUM4.2 trillion. \nSupport for businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises. The State \nFund  for  Support  of  Entrepreneurship  will  be  capitalized  with  an  additional \nSUM500 billion to expand loan guarantees and compensate for interest expenses \nup to a certain limit until 1 October 2020. A zero-rent policy has been introduced \nfor  businesses  using  3,600  government-owned  properties.  Businesses \nexperiencing financial hardships due to COVID-19 will not be declared bankrupt \nuntil  after  1 November  2020.  The  terms  of  investment  commitments  will  be \nextended  by  6 months.  To  support  trade  and  ensure  the  uninterrupted  flow  of \ngoods  across  the  CAREC  region,  businesses  will  be  allowed  to  export  without \npayment guarantees, and the penalties on overdue receivables will be suspended \nuntil 1 October 2020. Value-added tax and customs tax will be deferred for imports \nuntil 1 July 2020. Licensing requirements for freight of goods will be abolished. \nPublic works. A total of SUM3.6 trillion will be allocated to the Public Works Fund \nunder the ACF for public works in the regions (rehabilitation of urban, agriculture, \n\n29 About 250,000 entrepreneurs and enterprises and 83,000 farms have benefitted from tax deferment. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nsanitation and health, and education-related facilities) and small industrial zones.30 \nIn April 2020, public works provided temporary employment for 67,000 people. The \ngovernment will also reprioritize budget expenditures to redirect savings of SUM6 \ntrillion to projects for entrepreneurs and employment.  \n\n15. \nAdditional  monetary  measures.  Loan  maturities  have  been  extended  and  loan \npayments  worth  SUM7.9  trillion  have  been  deferred  without  penalty  until  1  October  2020  for \nbusinesses  in the most affected  sectors,  i.e., tourism,  hotels, transport, private education,  and \ninternational trade. Additional loan deferment and restructurings of SUM11.7 trillion for affected \nindividuals, self-employed entrepreneurs, and businesses have been introduced.31 Interest-free \nloans will be provided for businesses to continue wage payments and to strategic enterprises for \ndebt  repayment.  State-owned  banks  will  provide  businesses  renewable  revolving  loans  worth \nSUM30 trillion for working capital. Loans for construction of individual housing will be availed to \nstimulate the economy. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) lowered its benchmark interest \nrate from 16% to 15% in April 2020. It will provide monthly liquidity of up to SUM1 trillion through \nrepurchase agreements and swap arrangements and ease the mandatory reserve requirements \nto  provide  SUM2.6  trillion  liquidity  for  commercial  banks.  A  special  mechanism  for  additional \nliquidity of up to 3 years for SUM2 trillion has been introduced. The CBU recommended stress \ntesting of the banks by 1 June 2020.32   \n \nSocial spending. The government has increased social spending from SUM26.7 trillion \n16. \nin  2019  to  SUM34.4  trillion  in  2020  to  enhance  its  existing  comprehensive  social  protection \nsystem.33 Under  the  ACF,  SUM0.7  trillion  ($73.2  million)  has  been  allocated  to  expand  social \nsafety nets for the poor and vulnerable groups.34 Since 1 April 2020, the number of low-income \nhouseholds receiving social and childcare benefits (families with children under the age of 14) \nhas been increased by 10%\u2014from 595,400 to 655,000. Starting 1 June 2020, an additional 10% \nincrease raises the number of households to 720,000. Expiring social benefit payments have been \nextended up to 12 months. Eligibility criteria for social benefits has been simplified and the income \ncriterion  relaxed,  resulting  in  an  additional  123,000  households  receiving  social  and  childcare \n\n \n\n30 Such public works will be small-scale and/or low-skilled, mostly maintenance-related and confined to existing facilities \n\nfor the purposes of boosting short-term employment. \n\n31 As of May 2020, loan deferment by commercial banks have reached more than SUM23 trillion, exceeding the planned \n\namount of SUM19.6 trillion. About 87,000 business entities and two million citizens have benefitted. \n\n32 There  are  13  state-owned banks  out  of  30  commercial  banks,  accounting  for  more  than 80%  of  banking capital, \nassets, and deposits. As of March 2020, banks had a regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk weighted asset ratio of 19.7% \nand a low nonperforming loan ratio of 2.3% (Government of Uzbekistan, MOF. 2020. Newsletter No. 11. May). The \nbanking sector was rated stable due to low household debt, stable deposits, and a limited refinancing risk from long-\nterm loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2020. Banking System Outlook Update \u2013 \nUzbekistan.  8  April.  Report  No.  1222398).  With  the  pandemic,  risks  for  business  growth,  earning  prospects,  and \nasset  quality have  increased. The  outlook has  been  downgraded to  negative  in  April  2020  (S&P  Global  Ratings. \nVarious Rating Actions Taken on Uzbek Banks Amid Market Volatility and the COVID-19 Pandemic. 27 April 2020). \n33 Social protection expenditures, including pensions, accounted for 10% of GDP, comparable to high-income countries, \nand  benefit  women more  than  men  because  of  the  higher number  of  women  pensioners  and  targeted  programs \n(ADB. 2017. Uzbekistan Social Protection Indicator. Manila). In 2019, 47% of the population was covered by at least \none social protection benefit; 32% of people with disabilities collected disability benefits; 68% of poor people were \ncovered by social protection; and the retirement age population received full pension coverage (H. Holzhacker. 2020. \nCOVID-19: Economic Impact and Mitigation Measures. Urumqi: CAREC Institute). About 60% of the social protection \ntransfers are received by the bottom quintile in terms of per capita consumption (L. Carraco. 2019. Overview of Social \nProtection System in Uzbekistan and Assessment of Active Labor Market Policies. Oxford Policy Management). \n34 Social benefit transfers to families and children accounted for 5% of the state budget in 2020. The main social benefits \ncomprise (i) maternity allowances (up to age 2) for 264,132 families; (ii) family benefits (with children up to age 14) \nfor  265,603  families;  (iii)  assistance  to  low-income  families  for  65,704  families;  (iv) disability  benefits  for 286,400 \nrecipients; and (v) elderly and disability assistance for 104,700 recipients. Government of Uzbekistan, MOF. Budget \nfor Citizens, 2020. November 2019. Tashkent. \n\n \n\n\fSound  macroeconomic  management.  Uzbekistan  had  a  sound \n\nbenefits, increasing the total number of households to 843,000. A total of 1.04 million employees \nof  state  educational,  sports,  and  cultural  institutions  will  continue  to  receive  their  salaries  as \nbudgeted.  Laying  off  quarantined  employees  and/or  their  family  members  is  prohibited, \nguaranteeing  the  preservation  of  jobs.  Quarantine  leave  is  granted  to  parents  of  kindergarten \npupils  and  primary  school  students.  Temporary  disability  benefits  (benefit  rate  increased  from \n60%\u201380%  to  100%  of  the  average  monthly  salary)  will  be  given  to  quarantined  parents  under \nsimplified  application  procedures.  The  elderly  living  alone,  and  people  with  disabilities,  will  be \nsupplied  with  free food and hygiene products.  Paid leave will  be  provided to a working  parent \ncaring  for  children.  Employees,  especially  pregnant  women,  the  elderly,  and  people  with \ndisabilities and chronic diseases, will be on 100% paid leave. Staple foods will be imported as \nneeded to prevent shortages and artificial price hikes. \n \nrecord  of \n17. \nmacroeconomic  management  leading  up  to  the  crisis.35 Strong  macroeconomic  fundamentals \nhelped  achieve  5.6%  GDP  growth  in  2019  and  average  growth  of  6.8%  during  2010\u20132019. \nStructural  reforms  since  2017  are  supporting  the  transition  to  a  private  sector-driven  market \neconomy.  Historically,  the  country  has  pursued  a  conservative fiscal  and  debt  policy.  In  2019, \nexternal  debt  was  43.5%  of  GDP  and  public  debt  was  29.2%  of  GDP,  with  official  foreign \nexchange reserves reaching $29.2 billion (equivalent to 14 months of imports). The fiscal deficit \nwidened from 1.9% of GDP in 2017 to 3.9% of GDP in 2019 due to the social spending to mitigate \nthe impact of structural reforms. Currency devaluation by 48% in 2017, price liberalization, and \nbank credit growth (103.8% in 2017 and 51.3% in 2018) increased inflation from 8.8% in 2016 to \n17.5% in 2018. Under the inflation targeting regime and the policy of reduced directed lending to \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), inflation is expected to decrease from 14.5% in 2019 to 12.9% \nin 2020 and 9.5% in 2021. The CBU targets inflation below 10% by 2021 and 5% by 2023. \n \nB. \n \nThe  program  supports  the  measures  described  in  Table  2,  of  which  the  ACF  is  the \n18. \npredominant part, to help mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the population\u2019s health, \nincomes, and economic opportunities as well as macroeconomic stability. The outcome will be \nthe COVID-19 outbreak more effectively managed and its adverse social and economic impacts \nreduced.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  COVID-19  response  and  health  system  strengthening \nmeasures implemented; (ii) affected sectors and businesses supported to prevent job losses from \nthe  economic  downturn;  and  (iii)  dedicated  social  safety  net  funds  for  social  protection  and \ncompensation  for  economic  losses  of  low-income  households  expanded.  The  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  (DMF)  is  in  Appendix  1.  The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership  strategy,  2019\u20132023  for  Uzbekistan,  especially  on  reducing  economic  and  social \ndisparities,  strengthening  economic  governance,  supporting  private  sector  development,  and \npromoting regional cooperation and integration.36  \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s value addition, including lessons learned from crisis lending. The program is \nbased on extensive policy dialogue with the government and development partner coordination. \nIt  draws  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  Countercyclical  Support  Facility  loans  during \ndifferent emergency and crisis situations. These lessons are even more pertinent for the COVID-\n19 pandemic crisis, which requires parallel interventions on several fronts. The lessons include \n(i) the timeliness of the countercyclical response to stabilize the economy and protect livelihoods; \n\nProposed Program, Impacts, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n35 The IMF confirmed the sound macroeconomic management in the IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list \n\nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n36 ADB. 2019.

The program is part of ADB\u2019s comprehensive country assistance, which is aligned with \nthe  government\u2019s  development  strategy.  It  complements  the  ongoing  and  proposed  policy \ndialogue  and  program,  project,  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  pipeline,  aimed  at  improving  (i) \nhealth systems; (ii) technical and vocational skills; (iii) the enabling environment for private sector \ndevelopment, including SMEs and public\u2013private partnerships; (iv) public resource management \nand SOE reforms; and (v) regional cooperation and integration. ADB\u2019s support for strengthening \nthe health sector capacity under the Primary Health Care Improvement Project,37 a grant of $1.56 \nmillion allocated for Uzbekistan to procure medical supplies and equipment under its regional TA \nfor COVID-19,38 and the proposed emergency assistance loan of $100 million under the COVID-\n19  Emergency  Response  Project39 will  complement  the  program.  ADB\u2019s  overall  health  sector \nsupport is a unique value addition, as it not only helps enhance the testing, diagnosis, and clinical \ntreatment  capacity  of  COVID-19  patients  but  also strengthens the  preventive health system  to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  resilience  to  future  public  health  disasters.  Together  with  ongoing  and \nplanned health-related projects, the program will generate a substantial regional public good by \nstrengthening regional cooperation among CAREC countries to control the spread of COVID-19 \nthrough  sharing  of  information, medical  supplies,  and  staff for  pandemic management  and  the \nadoption  of  WHO-recommended  standards  and  best  practices.40 The  program  also  facilitates \nregional integration through its support for export-oriented SMEs and cross-border trade in goods \nand services. ADB\u2019s proposed policy-based loans for 2020 will complement the support for SMEs \nand financial inclusion, financial market development, and SOE reforms in the energy sector. \n \n20. \nThe  program  implementation  will  be  monitored  by  an  ongoing  TA  through  allocating \nadditional resources. 41 This TA will also support the medium-term public sector reforms including \n(i) the policy formulation for emergency expenditures and social transfers under the medium-term \nbudget  framework;  (ii)  strengthening  investment  planning  and  outcome-based  budgeting  for \nhealth and social expenditures; (iii) developing a formula-based intergovernmental fiscal transfer \nsystem in line with local governments\u2019 enhanced role in service delivery during disasters; (iv) debt \nand  fiscal  risk  management;  (v)  risk-based  banking  supervision;  and  (vi)  developing  suitable \nfinancial services in state-owned banks for businesses affected by the pandemic.

Of that amount, $1 billion will be used for the ACF. \nThe government will increase its foreign borrowing from $1.7 billion to $2.7 billion in 2020, which \nwill  be  mainly  financed  through  borrowing  from  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs).

The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity  is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB. The loan is expected to be disbursed in June 2020. The loan size is based on the financing \nneeds, and the countercyclical expenditures.     \n \n24. \nDebt  sustainability  analysis.  ADB\u2019s  public  debt  sustainability  analysis  (April  2020) \nindicates  sustainable  public  debt  and  a  low  risk  of  debt  stress,  even  in  the  post-COVID-19 \nscenario. 43  The  IMF  Assessment  Letter  (footnote  35)  and  its  debt  sustainability  analysis \ncorroborate  this  conclusion.44 ADB\u2019s  analysis  shows  that  loans  for  COVID-19  will  increase  the \noutstanding public debt stock by 13.7% (6.1% from ADB and 7.6% from the IMF and the World \nBank).  The  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  (excluding  public  guarantees)  is  projected  to  increase  from \n23.3%  in 2019 to 33.3%  by 2021  and  to decline  steadily  to 31.2%  by  2024,  which will  remain \nbelow the threshold of 70% for low debt stress. The debt sustainability will not be impaired as the \npublic debt remains moderately low. Long-term and highly concessional loans, mostly from IFIs, \naccount  for  more  than  70%  of  total  debt  and  keep  borrowing  costs  low.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  foreign \nexchange reserves position is strong, with more than 50% held as gold. The external debt stock \nis projected to increase from 43.5% in 2019 to 47.6% in 2021, below the threshold of 55%. Even \nif the entire financing need of $3.41 billion (5.6% of GDP) is borrowed, the external debt\u2013GDP \nratio will remain below the relevant thresholds. While the Budget Law, 2020 established a debt \nceiling of $4 billion for the fiscal year to limit sovereign external debt accumulation, the ceiling will \nbe revised to meet the increased financing needs. \n \nD. \n \nEffective development partner coordination has enabled timely support to the government, \n25. \nincluding catalyzing financing from various development partners.45 ADB has coordinated with the \nIMF  and  the World  Bank  on  the  macroeconomic assessment.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  program  ($500 \nmillion), the World Bank\u2019s two Development Policy Operations ($700 million), and the IMF\u2019s Rapid \nCredit  Facility  and  Rapid Financing  Instrument ($375 million)  have  ensured  budget  support  for \nfinancing the government\u2019s countercyclical response. WHO has helped the MOH operationalize \nthe COVID-19 SPRP. The World Bank has helped strengthen social protection under the Health \nand Social  Safety  Net  Project  ($95  million  loan),  providing  $38 million  for  disease  surveillance \ncapacity  and  $57  million  for  the  provision  of  low-income  family  allowances  and  one-off \nunemployment benefits. The agencies of the United Nations have also supported social protection \nfor low-income households, women, children and returning migrant workers. ADB has provided a \ncomprehensive  health  sector  support  for  the  government,  including  the  proposed  COVID-19 \nEmergency  Response  Project  (para.  19)  with  $100  million  cofinancing  from  the  Asian \nInfrastructure Investment Bank. \n\nDevelopment Partner Coordination \n\n \n\n43 Debt  Sustainability  Analysis  (accessible  from  the  list of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  simulated  scenarios  on \n\ndrivers of debt dynamics such as growth, exchange rate, real interest rate, and primary deficit. \n\n44 IMF.  18  May  2020.

Through  a  dedicated  unit,  the \nMOF  will  monitor  the  activities  and  expenditures  under  the  program;  submit  to  ADB  quarterly \nreports until 6 months after the loan effectiveness date; and engage in dialogue with ADB on (i) \nthe  macroeconomic  situation  and  financial  sector  conditions;  (ii)  implementation  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s anti-crisis measures under the COVID-19 pandemic response plan; (iii) activities \nand expenditures made from the state budget to support the countercyclical measures, including \nexpenditures  on medical  response  activities,  support  for  affected  sectors  and businesses,  and \nsocial  protection;  and  (iv)  tracking  of  beneficiaries  of  social  assistance  programs,  with  gender \nindicators  (with  sex-disaggregated  data).  The  monitoring  of  the  financial  management \narrangements and indicators under the DMF and the gender monitoring matrix will be carried out \nby  the  budget  and  gender  specialists  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  (footnote  41)  as  part  of  the  program \nengagement framework in close coordination with the MOF, MOH, Ministry of Employment and \nLabor  Relations,  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Poverty  Reduction,  Agency  for \nDevelopment of Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and State Committee on Statistics. The \nproceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in a single disbursement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The program\u2019s implementation \nperiod is from 30 June 2020 to 31 December 2020.46 The loan closing date is 29 January 2021. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n27. \nGovernance. A governance risk assessment was carried out in line with ADB\u2019s Second \nGovernance and Anticorruption Action Plan.47 The government is fully committed to improving the \nquality  of  governance  and  mitigating  governance  risks  by  strengthening  the  rule  of  law  and \nanticorruption  measures. 48  The  2019  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability \nassessment showed that the overall PFM systems are good, with credible budget planning and \nexecution. 49 The IMF  has  supported the  medium-term  budget  framework  and  strengthening  of \ndebt  management  and  treasury  functions.  No  major  fiduciary  risks  and/or  mismanagement  of \npublic  resources  have  been  identified. 50  ADB  has  supported  the  implementation  of  the \nInternational Public Sector Accounting Standards based on a road map developed in 2019. To \nstrengthen risk management and fraud prevention, the MOF adopted a risk-based internal audit \nmanual in 2019; and several ministries and/or agencies, including the MOH, have strengthened \ntheir internal audit units with support from ADB. An electronic procurement system is in operation. \nThe new  public  procurement  law, adopted  in 2018,  is  being  improved  in line  with international \ngood practices. ADB has supported corporate governance improvements for SOEs based on a \nroad  map  approved  in  2019  and  the  implementation  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards (now mandatory for all large companies starting in 2021).

Fiscal risk \nmanagement, including contingent liabilities, is strengthened under the PFM Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132028. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nGender.  The  program \n\nis  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  as \n\nparticularly low-income households, through (i) business closures; (ii) job losses, especially in the \ninformal  economy;  (iii)  rapid  depletion  of  household  incomes  and  savings  for  quarantined \nindividuals and their families; (iv) a downturn in remittance incomes, which typically supplement \nlow-income  households;  and  (v)  the  growing  number  of  returning  migrant  workers,  increasing \nunemployment. The program will play a critical role in poverty alleviation and social protection by \nhelping  the  government  take  timely  measures  to  (i) safeguard  the  health,  well-being,  and \nproductivity  of  citizens  by  strengthening the  health care system; (ii)  expand  social  safety  nets, \nincluding  direct  support  for  low-income  households  and  those  affected  by  the  pandemic;  (iii) \nmaintain  employment  through  job-creating  regional  public  works  and  prohibiting  the  layoff  of \nquarantined employees; and (iv) support businesses to enable a quick economic recovery.51  \n \n29. \nthe \ncountercyclical response involves social sector measures to preserve the health, incomes, and \nlivelihoods  of  women,  children,  and  low-income  households.52 With  women  representing  more \nthan 80% of the health sector workforce, 53 they are at the frontline, facing high risk of infection \nduring  the  pandemic.54 As  health  care  is  among  the  lowest  paying  sectors,  the  government\u2019s \nhealth  measures  include  salary  supplements  in  the  form  of  hazard  pay  for  the  medical  staff, \ndirectly affected by COVID-19. Women constitute about 70% of the schoolteachers and will be \nseverely  affected  by  the  closure  of  all  educational  institutions.  Women\u2019s  job  prospects  will  be \nimpacted by COVID-19 related business closures. Low-income households, especially women-\nheaded  households raising  children,  are likely  to  face  impoverishment  due  to  loss of jobs  and \nincreasing health care related expenditures. \n  \n30. \nThe program will support the delivery of critical medical equipment and appropriately sized \npersonal  protective gear,  including  individual  packages for  female health workers,  to  identified \nmedical facilities. Sector-specific tax incentives and loan deferments will be provided to SMEs, of \nwhich  at  least  40%  are  women-owned  and/or  managed.  An  additional  SUM500  billion  will  be \nprovided  to  the  State  Fund  for  Support  of  Entrepreneurship  to  provide  guarantees  and \ncompensation  of  interest  expenses  for  SMEs.  At  least  40%  of  SMEs  that  are  women-owned \nand/or managed will benefit from these funds. Small-scale public works in the regions will target \nthe employment of members of low-income households. The number of low-income households \nreceiving childcare and social benefits will be increased by at least 10% in 2020, prioritizing single \nmothers, divorced women, and widows. The targeting and distribution of benefits to low-income \nhouseholds and those affected by the pandemic will be done through the government\u2019s framework \nfor social protection (footnote 34), including the sex-disaggregated databases available at mahalla \ncommittees, 55  the  Unified  Register  of  Social  Protection,  56  the  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social \nProtection,  and  the  Federation  of  Trade  Unions.  At  least  50%  of  temporary  disability  benefits, \nprovided to quarantined parents and individuals caring for children, will be given to women. The \nsalaries of 1.04 million schoolteachers, of whom 70% are women, will continue to be paid.57 \n\n \n\n51 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n52 The program is aligned with the government\u2019s Strategy for Achieving Gender Equality, 2020\u20132030, which prioritizes \n\nincreasing the sociopolitical role and economic independence of women, especially in rural areas.  \n\n53 While  gender  parity is  maintained  among  medical  doctors  (49.6% male  doctors  against 50.4%  female  doctors  in \n\n2016), gender asymmetry is higher among medical nurses (7.7% males against 92.3% females in 2016).  \n\n54 As of 26 May 2020, 353 medical staff were infected with COVID-19, including 286 females, representing 11% of the \n\ntotal number of COVID-19 cases, while health workers represent only 1.3% of the population. \n\n55 The  Ministry  of  Mahallas  and  Family  Support  uses  criteria  such  as  income,  single  women-headed  households, \n\nwidows, disabilities, the number of children, and living conditions to select and distribute social benefits.    \n\n56 The Unified Register, an automated information system, was set up with technical assistance from the World Bank. \nThe UNDP and UNICEF have also supported improvements in the distribution of social benefits. An online food and \nmedicine distribution for 5,000 beneficiaries in the Namangan region has been piloted by the UNDP. \n\n57 DMF in Appendix 1 and Gender Monitoring Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n31. \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. It is \nnot expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts within the meaning of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement.  \n\n \nRisk mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table \n\n32. \n4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.58 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nCOVID-19 has the potential to escalate globally and in \nUzbekistan,  including  a  rise  in  undetected  cases. \nCombined with a prolonged global economic slowdown, \nlarge-scale  economic \nescalation  carries \ndisruption, the closure of SMEs, higher unemployment, \nand  lower  incomes.  These  could  overwhelm  the \ngovernment\u2019s measures to fight the pandemic. \n\nrisks  of \n\nPoverty incidence is likely to increase. Women will be \naffected  as  they  form  a  higher  share  of  the  medical \nworkforce  and  schoolteachers;  they  are  prone  to  job \nlosses  in  the  informal  economy;  and  they  are  the \nprimary caregivers for infected persons. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe government has taken proactive measures, including \nthe establishment of the ACF of SUM10 trillion, to (i) put \nin  place  health-related  measures;  (ii)  provide  fiscal  and \nto  businesses,  employment,  and \nmonetary  support \nregional economic activity; and (iii) expand social safety \nnets for low-income households.

The pandemic has \nsignificantly impacted Uzbekistan\u2019s export of natural gas, copper, cotton, textile and agriculture products, constrained \nsupply chains and trade, reduced remittances inflows, halted transportation and tourism. Main risks to Uzbekistan\u2019s \neconomy  arise  from  the  uncertainty  around  the  duration  of  health  response  measures  that  resulted  in  decline  in \ndomestic consumption and business disruptions, particularly for SMEs which represent 56.5% of GDP and provides \n78% of formal and informal sector jobs combined. Over 80,000 enterprises in food catering, retail trade, services and \ntransportation have stopped operating due to social distancing measures introduced in March 2020. Uzbekistan\u2019s real \nGDP growth is, therefore, projected to drop to 1.5% in 2020, from the initial forecast of 6% before the pandemic. The \nprojected sectoral growth at constant factor prices in industry will drop from 8.9% in 2019 to 2.1% in 2020, and services \nfrom 5.5% in 2019 to 0.6% in 2020 while the growth in agriculture will remain stable at 2.6% in 2020 against 2.5% \ngrowth in 2019. The real growth of private final consumption is projected to decline to 0.3% in 2020, against the pre-\nCOVID-19 growth estimate of 10.4%. The real growth of gross fixed capital formation is projected to decline to 4.5% \nin  2020  against  the  pre-COVID-19  growth  estimate  of  8%.  GDP  per  capita  was  expected  to  grow  by  14.5%  from \n$1,742  in 2019 to  $1,995  in 2020 under pre-COVID-19 estimates. The revised  projections  indicate that per capita \nGDP will grow by only 3% to reach $1,795. The economic shock has dramatically reduced the employment, incomes, \nand wellbeing of citizens. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 16.5% in 2020 from 9.4% in 2019 with layoffs \nand returning migrant workers. The median household incomes have declined by 38% in April 2020 (46% in urban \nareas and  by 37% in rural  and semi-urban areas). Income  losses  in the  urban sector resulting from the  lockdown \nmeasures have spillover effects on rural incomes and on the informal sector, thereby worsening the poverty situation. \nThe fiscal deficit  is projected to  widen to 5.6%  of GDP ($3.41  billion) against the  pre-COVID-19  estimate of  2.7% \n($1.86 billion) for 2020. Budget revenues are expected to fall to 25.2% of GDP in 2020 compared to 28.6% of GDP in \n2019, driven by fall in taxes. The pandemic is putting fiscal pressure on the government with the larger budget deficits \nexpected in the second quarter of 2020, depending on the speed and breadth of disease spread. The government \ndecided to lift its cap of $4 billion in total foreign borrowings to finance the pandemic response. The government plans \nto borrow from IFIs to finance the fiscal deficit. The uncertainty in the financial markets is constraining the liquidity \noptions for the government, which just debuted with its Eurobonds in 2019. The sum depreciated by 6.7% against the \nUnited States dollar from 1 January 2020 to 15 April 2020 and it has been stable since mid-April. The CBU lowered \nits benchmark interest rate from 16% to 15%. \nThe government laid out a comprehensive set of health, economic stabilization, and social protection measures under \nthe  Presidential  Decrees  No.  5969,  No.  5978  and  No.5996  and  established  the  ACF  of  SUM10  trillion  under  the \nbudget.  These  measures  constitute  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19  pandemic  response  plan.  Main  health  measures \ncomprise  (i)  improving  the  capacity  and  preparedness  of  sanitary-epidemiological  units,  hospitals  and  quarantine \ncomplexes; (ii) addressing shortages in testing systems; (iii) procuring protective and diagnostic equipment, and (iv) \nproviding  salary  supplements  in  the  form  of  hazard  pay  for  medical  staff,  directly  affected  by  COVID-19.  Main \neconomic  stabilization  measures  comprise  (i)  supporting  affected  businesses,  including  tourism,  transport,  and \nservices through various tax incentives and loan deferments and (ii) creating jobs through public works in the regions. \n\n\f \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n3.

Structural Reforms  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n25 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nThese measures are supplemented  by monetary measures aimed at  increasing  access to finance for businesses, \nparticularly SMEs. Main social protection measures, targeting the poor and vulnerable groups, comprise (i) expanding \nsocial  assistance  programs  for  low-income  households  receiving  childcare  benefits  and  increasing  the  number  of \nhouseholds  qualifying  for  social  benefits;  (ii)  paying  salaries  of  public  sector  workers  (i.e.  teachers)  and  providing \ntemporary  disability  benefits  to  quarantined  workers;  and  (iii)  expanding  paid  leave  and  work  from  home \narrangements. The government\u2019s response has strong gender and social protection elements to preserve the health, \nincomes  and  livelihood  of  women,  children  and  low-income  households.  It  supports  delivery  of  critical  medical \nequipment for health workers, of which 80% are women. The incentives for businesses will benefit the women owned \nand/or managed SMEs, which constitute 43% of SMEs. Small-scale regional public works will target employment of \nmembers of low-income households. The number of low-income households receiving childcare and social benefits \nwill be increased by at least 10% in 2020, prioritizing single mothers, divorced women and widows. Furthermore, with \nthe eligibility criteria for social benefits simplified and the income criterion relaxed, the total number of households \nreceiving  social  and  childcare  benefits  will  reach  843,000  compared  to  595,400  before  the  pandemic.  Temporary \ndisability benefits will be provided to quarantined parents and individuals caring for children. Salaries of 1.04 million \nschoolteachers, of whom 70% are women, will continue to be paid. \nUzbekistan has a strong record of sound macroeconomic management. The economy expanded by 6.8% on average \nduring 2010\u20132019. Uzbekistan has embarked on structural macroeconomic reforms in 2017, including liberalization \nof foreign exchange, governance reforms for SOEs, and tax reforms to move away from a development model built \non import-substitution and SOEs to one based on private sector-driven market-economy and to open the country to \ninternational markets. Uzbekistan has achieved 5.6% GDP growth in 2019, driven by (i) real growth in industry (8.9%) \nand services (5.5%), (ii) growth in gross fixed capital formation (46%) and private consumption (6.3%), (iii) remittance \ninflows, (iv) economic diversification with rising private sector participation, (v) growth in merchandise exports (22.1%) \ndriven  by  international  demand  and  high  global  prices  for  its  export  products  (natural  gas,  cotton  and  non-ferrous \nmetals), and (vi) foreign investment, including financing from the international financial institutions. Historically, the \ncountry has pursued a conservative fiscal and debt policy with official foreign exchange reserves standing at $29.2 \nbillion (equivalent to 14 months of imports), external debt at 43.5% of GDP, and public debt at 29.2% of GDP in 2019. \nHowever, recent structural reforms have led to widening of the fiscal deficit from 1.9% of GDP in 2017 to 3.9% of GDP \nin 2019, reflecting the increasing social spending to mitigate the impact of the structural reforms. Devaluation of the \ncurrency by 48% in 2017, price liberalization and growth in bank credit (103.8% in 2017 and 51.3% in 2018) led to \nrising inflation from 8.8% in 2016 to 17.5% in 2018. With CBU\u2019s inflation targeting regime and government\u2019s policy of \nreducing directed lending to SOEs, inflation slowed to 14.5% in 2019. CBU aims to bring inflation below 10% by 2021 \nand 5% by 2023.The national poverty rate has been declining from 25.8% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2018, reflecting rising \nshare of SMEs, remittance inflows, regular public wage increases, and targeted social safety nets.   \nThe government implemented a robust response to control the spread of the COVID-19 and provide urgent medical \nsupport  to  affected  population.  The  government  has  collaborated  closely  with  the  WHO,  agencies  of  the  United \nNations  and  international  development  partners,  including  ADB  to  strengthen  the  health  response  and  mobilize \nsupport  for  the  COVID-19  response.  The  government  took  early  preventive  steps  since  end-January  2020  and \nestablished  the Special Republican Commission,  headed by the  Prime Minister. When the  first COVID-19  positive \ncase was confirmed on 15 March 2020, the government took proactive measures to prevent the nationwide spread of \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n5. Debt Sustainability \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \nthe  COVID-19  and  strengthen  the  preparedness  of  the  health  system.  From  16  March  2020  onwards,  (i)  all \ninternational and domestic travel has been suspended and borders were closed except for freight, (ii) all educational \ninstitutions have been closed with over 8 million students impacted by the closures (online education started as of 30 \nMarch 2020), (iii)  public events were cancelled, and (iv) business hours have been restricted and remote  working \n(work from home) has become compulsory for non-essential services, including for government employees.  On 19 \nMarch 2020, the MOH launched the COVID-19 SPRP, prepared with assistance from the WHO. The COVID-19 SPRP \nis a framework document, covering the protocols on risk communication and community engagement, strengthening \nmedical  systems  for  infectious  disease  monitoring  and  control,  and  mitigation  of  socioeconomic  impact.  WHO  is \nproviding  technical  training  to  MOH  in  case  detection,  isolation  and  management,  contact  tracing,  laboratory  and \nCOVID-19 test kits, infection prevention control in different settings, COVID-19 data collection, risk communication \nand COVID-19 procurement specifications. As of 22 May 2020, more than 40,000 doctors and 32,000 nurses have \nbeen trained. The development partners, including ADB, World Bank, and the agencies of the United Nations as well \nas several countries bilaterally have provided technical and financial assistance for procurement of critical medical \nequipment and supplies, capacity building of medical staff and expanding social support systems. To undertake health-\nrelated interventions for diagnosing, preventing and combating the COVID-19 outbreak, the government has allocated \nSUM1 trillion (about $104.6 million) from the ACF. Of that amount, as of 15 April 2020, over SUM226 billion has been \ndirected to the Agency for Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance and regional centers; SUM411 billion to prepare \nand equip specialized  hospitals and quarantine complexes; and about SUM140 billion to purchase equipment and \ntesting kits. Two dedicated COVID-19 hospitals \u2013 one with 20,800 beds in the Upper Chirchik District and another with \n10,000 beds in the Zangiata District \u2013 have been prepared. Modular hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and quarantine \nstations with capacity of 1,000 people each are under preparation in Surkhandarya, Namangan and Navoi regions. \nMOH purchased testing kits and ventilators; set up mobile laboratories in high-risk areas; and production of medical \nmasks have been increased to 5 million pieces a day. More than 250,000 tests have been conducted as of 28 April \n2020  with  plans  to  conduct  400,000  in  total,  including  paid  tests  by  non-governmental  medical  organizations  of \nUzbekistan until 1 September 2020. Government also adopted new strategy aimed at strengthening the network of \n37  medical  vocational  schools  in  the  regions  and  sanitary-epidemiological  response  system  to  address  future \npandemics. Besides the health measures, the government\u2019s response includes economic stabilization measures and \nsupport for businesses and expansion of social  protection for the low-income  households (further details provided \nunder criteria 2) in line with the government\u2019s medium-term development strategy and structural reforms for promoting \nprivate  sector  development  and  achieving  inclusive  and  sustainable  economic  growth  with  poverty  reduction.  The \ngovernment remains committed to implementation of other ongoing structural reforms on macroeconomic and public \nfinancial management to improve the effectiveness of the countercyclical response. \nThe debt sustainability analysis conducted by ADB in April 2020 showed that Uzbekistan\u2019s debt levels are sustainable. \nThe IMF confirmed that Uzbekistan has a low risk of debt stress in the IMF Assessment Letter dated 14 April 2020 \nand its latest staff report dated 18 May 2020 for the disbursement of Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing. Highly \nconcessional  foreign  loans,  primarily  from  IFIs,  account  for  over  70%  of  total  debt  and  keep  the  government\u2019s \nborrowing costs low. Uzbekistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves position is strong ($30.5 billion as of March 2020) with \nover 50% held as gold reserves. The budget support loans during COVID-19 will increase the outstanding public debt \nstock by 13.7% (6.1% from ADB) and (7.6% from the IMF and the World Bank). The public debt to GDP ratio (excluding \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n27 \n\nAccess Criteria \n\n6. Coordination with the \nInternational Monetary \nFund \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \npublic guarantees) is projected to increase from 23.3% in 2019 to 33.3% by 2021 and is projected to steadily decline \nto 31.2% by 2024, which will remain below the required threshold of 70% for low debt stress. However, Uzbekistan\u2019s \ndebt sustainability will not be impaired as the public debt remains moderately low. External debt stock is projected to \nincrease from 43.5% in 2019 to 46.3% in 2020 and 47.6% in 2021 and fall below 47% by 2023, below the required \nthreshold of 55% for low debt stress. \nThe program was developed in close coordination and consultation with the IMF, which provided its Assessment Letter \nto ADB on 14 April 2020.
