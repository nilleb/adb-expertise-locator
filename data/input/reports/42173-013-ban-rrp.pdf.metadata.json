The  project  will  also  include  distribution  network  improvements  to  reduce \nnonrevenue  water  (NRW);  and  will  improve  the  quality  of  water  supply  services,  including \nsupport to low-income communities.2\n  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nWater security. The government has set a target of providing safe water coverage and \n3. \nfull  sanitation  throughout  the  country  by  2015.  However,  achieving  and  sustaining  this  target \nremains a major challenge, with population growth in urban areas much higher than the national \naverage. 3 Dhaka  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Authority  (DWASA)  provides  water  supply  to \nabout 90% of the population of 10.7 million in its service areas of about 400 square kilometers \n(km2), but is unable to provide sufficient quality and quantity of water to its beneficiaries despite \ncontinual  efforts  for  improvements.4\n It  plans  to  expand  its  service  areas  to  about  500 km2  by \n2020  and  600  km2  by  2035,  with  a  projected  population  of  about  29 million.  This  requires \nsignificant  capital  investments  to  increase  the  level  of  supply,  while  ensuring  long-term  water \nsecurity.   \n \nEnvironmental  sustainability.  DWASA has  been  relying  heavily  on  groundwater  as  a \n4. \nsource  of  water  supply, 5\n but  current  abstraction  is  beyond  sustainable  yields.  Groundwater \nresources are depleting, and the water table is falling by 2\u20133 meters per year, which makes the \nlifetime of deep tube wells shorter, with 40\u201360 deep tube wells becoming inoperable each year. \nGroundwater  extraction  needs  to  be  reduced  from  1,900  MLD  in  2012  to  1,360  MLD  by  2020 \nand 1,260 MLD by 2025, when the overall supply needs to be increased to cater to the growing \npopulation  in  larger  service  areas.  The  main  existing  source  of  surface  water  is  also  being \npolluted rapidly. Out of the total 2,400 MLD currently provided by DWASA, 450 MLD is provided \nby  the  Saidabad  WTP,  which  abstracts  surface  water  from  the  nearby  Sitalakhya  River.  The \nriver  water  quality  is  deteriorating,  particularly  in  terms  of  high  ammonia  concentration  during \nthe dry season owing to uncontrolled industrial effluent discharges into the river. The ammonia \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n3  Urban  population  growth  was  2.81%  per  annum  in  2005\u20132010,  higher  than  the  country\u2019s  population  growth  of \n1.12% during the same period. Dhaka city\u2019s population was 9.3 million in 2011, with an annual growth rate of 4.2% \nover 2001\u20132011.   \n\n4  Average hours of water supply in DWASA service areas are 22.5 hours per day, but supply hours are limited to 14\u2013\n\n15 hours per day in zones 4 and 10. \n\n5  Dependence  on  groundwater  was  about  90%  until  2012. With  the  commencement  of  operation  of  the  Saidabad \nWTP phase 2 with capacity of 225 MLD in December 2012, groundwater dependence has been reduced to about \n80%.   \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nconcentration  is  becoming  higher  than  the  design  standard  that  a  pre-treatment  unit  can \nsatisfactorily  treat  to  an  acceptable  level\u2014putting  the  sustainable  operation  of  the  WTP  at \nserious risk. This makes it essential for DWASA to find an adequate and sustainable source of \nraw  water  for  achieving  its  long-term  development  objectives.  Meghna  River  will  be  a  new \nsource of water supply for Dhaka, which has good water quality and ample quantity even during \nthe dry season.     \n \n5. \n Efficiency improvements. DWASA is implementing distribution network improvements \nfor water supply with Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing.6\n The ongoing investments are \nrehabilitating  and  strengthening  the  water  supply  systems  based  on  the  long-term  policy  and \ninvestment  road  map,  complemented  by  capacity  building  of  DWASA  to  manage  the  water \nsupply systems competently. Six contract packages have been awarded to reduce NRW to 15% \nin each district metered area in five out of 11 zones of the DWASA service area by 2015\u20132016. \n  \n6. \nReforms  in  progress.  Sector  reform  is  proceeding  under  the  partnership  framework \nbetween  the  government  and  development  partners,  supported  by  the  ongoing  ADB-financed \nproject  (footnote  6). 7\n Major  achievements  regarding  DWASA\u2019s  management  improvement \ninclude (i) an annual tariff increase of 5% every year since 2007; (ii) implementation of a 5-year \ncapacity building program for over 800 staff in areas including financial management, operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and billing and accounting; (iii) rationalization of staff evidenced by the \nreduction  in  the  ratio  of  staff  per  1,000  connections  from  17  in  2007  to  12  in  2012; \n(iv) development  of  a  5-year  business  plan \nthereafter; \n(v) computerization of the water connections database of about 310,000 customers; (vi) a fully \ncomputerized  billing  system;  and  (vii)  a  reduction  in  NRW  from  36%  in  2007  to  about  30%  in \n2012. As a result, DWASA recovers not only full O&M costs but also repayment of principal and \npayment of interest. \n \n7. \nThese efficiency gains and policy reforms need to be scaled up and sustained, including \nNRW  reductions  in  other  zones. While  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  system  is  being  improved, \ndeveloping  a  new  source  of  raw  water  for  long-term  water  security  in  Dhaka  is  essential \nbecause  of  the  large  increase  in  demand  associated  with  a  growing  population,  the  need  for \nmoving toward continuous water supply, and the need for reducing dependence on groundwater \nand ensuring the sustainable operation of existing surface water supply systems. Access to safe \nwater  should  be  provided  to  low-income  communities,  as  women  in  low-income  communities \nspend a significant amount of time collecting water for household use and the poor pay a higher \ncost for water from water vendors or through non-regularized water connections.  \n \n8. \nfrom  previous \ninterventions. Given the importance of improving efficiency, highlighted in the evaluation study, \nNRW reduction is actively being pursued prior to the supply augmentation.8 Project cofinancing \nhas been pursued in line with a conclusion of the post-evaluation that scaling up interventions \nthrough  cofinancing  is  a  good  option. 9\n AFD  and  the  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  will \ncofinance  the  project.  The  project  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan  and \n\nin  2011  and  annual  update \n\nLessons.

The outcome will be more reliable and improved security of water supply in Dhaka.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nOutput  1:  New  surface  water  supply  system  developed.  A  raw  water  intake  will  be \ndeveloped  at  Meghna  River,  about  30  kilometers  (km)  east  of  Dhaka,  with  structures  and  a \npumping station having capacity to provide a total of 2,000 MLD of raw water.11 Equipment such \nas pumps will be procured for 525 MLD only for the first phase of a new WTP at Gandharbpur. \nThe Gandharbpur WTP, located about 10 km east of Dhaka, will be constructed with production \ncapacity of 500 MLD. A raw water transmission pipeline from the intake to the WTP will also be \nconstructed.12\n The project also includes a treated water transmission pipeline from the WTP to \nthe injection point of the existing distribution network and distribution reinforcements. The WTP \nwill serve the population of about 3 million in Badda, Gulshan, Mirpur, and Uttara (whole zones \n5,  8,  and  9;  and  part  of  zones  4  and  10).  A  design\u2013build  contract  will  incentivize  design \ninnovation,  and  ensure  an  integrated  design  and  operation  from  the  intake  to  the  WTP.  The \nsame contractor will be engaged in the first 3 years of operation to prove the functionality, and \nbuild the capacity of DWASA personnel to manage and operate the facilities.   \n \n11. \nOutput 2: Distribution network strengthened. As a continuation of the ongoing efforts \ntoward  NRW  reduction,  distribution  network  improvements  will  be  implemented  in  zone  6  of \nDWASA\u2019s service areas. New or regularized connections at community or household levels will \nbe  provided  in  low-income  communities  in  this  zone  under  DWASA\u2019s  existing  pro-poor \ncommunity support scheme. Public awareness-raising programs will be conducted to strengthen \nunderstanding  on  water  use  and  conservation,  customer  services,  metered  connections,  and \nbilling  systems.  The  capacity  of  DWASA  in  engaging  and  supporting  low-income  communities \nwill be strengthened. At the same time, feasibility studies and preparation of bid documents will \nbe  undertaken  for  distribution  network  improvements  in  two  densely  populated  zones  in  the \nDWASA  service  area  (zones  1  and  2)  to  complete  the  distribution  network  improvement \nworks.13\n  \n \n12. \nOutput  3:  Project  management  and  administration  adequately  supported.  Support \nwill  be  provided  for  smooth  and  effective  project  implementation  and  operation  by  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) in DWASA. A new PMU for the project was established in May 2013, \nwith  core  staff  appointed.  A  project  coordination  unit  in  zone  6  will  be  involved  in  the \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, \n\n2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n\n11 The final capacity of the intake is 2,000 MLD\u20141,050 MLD for Gandharbpur WTP (including the second phase of \n500 MLD) and 950 MLD for Saidabad WTP (for the existing 450 MLD and the third phase of 450 MLD). A safety \nmargin of 5% has been added for the capacity of the intake for both WTPs. The Saidabad WTP plans to change \nthe source of raw water from Sitalakhya River to Meghna River in the future.  \n\n12 Land required for raw water transmission pipelines for both WTPs will be acquired under the project.  \n13 Under the ongoing ADB-financed project (footnote 6), network improvement is ongoing in five zones (3, 4, 5, 8, and \n10), and bid documents were prepared for two more zones (6 and 9). The proposed project will cover zone 6 and \nprepare bid documents for two more zones. The remaining two zones are in Narayanganj district and nearby (zone \n7), where the network system is relatively new.   \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fimplementation  of  output  2  to  ensure  a  smooth  transfer  and  successful  O&M  after  project \ncompletion.  As  the  nature  and  project  areas  of  outputs  1  and  2  are  distinct,  two  teams  of \nmanagement  and  supervision  consultants  will  be  engaged.  Three  teams  of  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will be engaged to facilitate the implementation of resettlement plans and \nassist in awareness-raising and community-related tasks.   \n \n13.  With  the  implementation  of  the  project,  groundwater  abstraction  is  expected  to  be \nreduced  by  150  MLD.  DWASA  targets  to  increase  the  overall  surface  water  supply  to \n1,900 MLD (including 500 MLD from this project) by 2021, which accounts for nearly 60% of the \ntotal water supply. Regarding wastewater management, DWASA approved a sewerage master \nplan  in  2012,  and  its  implementation  will  amply  treat  the  incremental  amount  of  wastewater \ngenerated by the project.    \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $674.9 million (Table 1). \n\n14. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n1.

As  nearby  water  bodies  (such  as  the  Balu,  Buriganga, \nSitalakhya,  and  Turag  rivers)  are  unsuitable  because  of  poor  and  deteriorating  water  quality, \nMeghna  River  has  been  selected  as  a  new  source.  Bangladesh\u2019s  river  morphology  is  highly \ndynamic,  and  careful  morphological  assessments  selected  the  location  of  the  intake  site  at \nBishnondi,  where  accretion  and  erosion  rates  are  much  lower  than  areas  upstream  and \ndownstream. Technical options recommended in the feasibility study were closely reviewed and \nsome changes proposed through the project preparatory technical assistance: pipeline corridors \nhave been widened to accommodate a paved access road for ease of maintenance as well for \ncommunity use. The raw water intake and WTP, together with a raw water transmission main in \nbetween,  will  adopt  a  design\u2013build  modality  to  incentivize  design  innovation  and  ensure  the \nintegrated design of the three components and their efficient operation.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nEconomic  analysis. The major benefits of the project will be sustainable water supply \nto  a  growing  population  in  service  areas\u2014including  improved  access,  convenience,  and \nreliability of water supply, as well as increased quantities of water and improved water quality. \nOther  indirect  benefits  arise  from  the  employment  of  skilled  and  semiskilled  workers  in  the \nconstruction  works.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  20.4%,  and  the  sensitivity  analysis \nconfirms  the  project  is  viable  under  adverse  conditions.  The  willingness  to  pay  is  substantially \nhigher than the  current monthly  water  expenses,  indicating  that  substantial  tariff  increases  are \neconomically and socially feasible.17\n \n \n20. \n\nFinancial analysis. The financial analysis of the project focused on assessing its impact \n\n                                                \n17 The average willingness to pay was Tk11.43 per cubic meter (m3) for domestic use, which is much higher than the \n\ntariff of Tk7.34/m3 in 2013. The survey was conducted during project preparation.  \n\n \n\n\fon DWASA\u2019s financial capability to ensure sufficient cash flow at the utility level to cover O&M \ncosts, depreciation, and debt service obligations. The analysis revealed that the current annual \n5% tariff increase would not be sufficient for the medium- to long-term financial sustainability of \nDWASA.18 Assuming a progressive tariff increase beyond 5% from FY2016, based on the tariff \nadjustment  plan  adopted  by  DWASA  in  2011,  DWASA\u2019s  debt  service  coverage  ratio  will \ngenerally  remain  above  1.0.19 The  government  has  assured  an  increase  beyond  5%  by  2015. \nADB,  through  its  technical  assistance,  is  assisting the government  in  establishing  a  regulatory \nframework for water supply, which includes the development of a transparent, predictable, and \nindependent  tariff-setting  mechanism  aimed  at  achieving  full  cost  recovery  of  water  supply \nservices  over  the  long  term. 20\n ADB  will  provide  continued  policy  advice  and  capacity \ndevelopment support to facilitate and monitor the development of such a framework.   \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n21. \nBangladesh\u2019s overall governance has improved with key governance reforms, including \nthe  constitution  of  the  Independent  Anti-Corruption  Commission  in  2004 and  the  enactment of \nthe Right to Information Act in 2009, the Whistle Blower Protection Act in 2011, and the Money \nLaundering Prevention Act in 2012. A comprehensive national integrity strategy was adopted in \n2012  to  address  corruption  holistically,  and  strengthen  governance  institutions  in  a  phased \nmanner. The financial management assessment indicated that DWASA has adequate financial \nmanagement  capabilities  for  implementing  the  project.  The  capacity  of  DWASA\u2019s  finance  and \naccounting  staff  will  be  strengthened  through  training  programs  conducted  under  the  project. \nDWASA  has  adequate  capacity  for  procuring  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in \naccordance  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements.  The  PMU  will  have  one  procurement \nofficer and will be supported by consultants in bid preparation and evaluation, particularly for the \ncomplex design\u2013build contract.  \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DWASA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\n23. \nIn  Dhaka,  access  to  water  is  mainly  dependent  on  household  pipe  connections  and \npublic  taps.  People  living  in  slums  or  poor communities  generally  do  not  have  legal  access  to \nwater supply and sanitation, as they often live on unauthorized lands without having legal titles. \nThey depend on illegal water lines and pay higher charges. The project will support organizing \ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs), with the assistance of NGOs, to make them eligible for \nlegal  water  connections.  Households  in  low-income  communities,  including  those  headed  by \nwomen,  will  have  access  to  water  supply  either  through  legalization  or  new  connections.  This \nwill  enable  the  poor  to  receive  water  at  a  lower  price  through  meters.  The  CBOs  will  be \nresponsible for payment of water tariffs and maintenance of the community water points. People \nin the intake area will benefit from a deep tube well built by the project, as arsenic is a common \nproblem in shallow tube wells in the area. To enhance awareness on water use, water quality, \nand  public  hygiene,  public  awareness  campaign  activities  will  be  implemented.  Capacity \ndevelopment of the communities will contribute toward sustainability of the benefits. Additionally, \n\n                                                \n18 Under the Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1996, DWASA is authorized to increase tariffs up to 5% per annum. \n\nThe government needs to approve a higher increase.  \n\n19 This will increase the tariff for domestic use to Tk17.71/m3 in FY2022.  \n20 ADB. 2013.

Expansion  of  the  piped  water  supply  network  will  benefit  women  by  reducing \ntheir burden to fetch water for the family. They will be able to participate and voice their views in \ndecisions related to water supply in the CBOs. A gender action plan has been prepared. More \nfocused  and  efficient  community  awareness-raising  campaigns  will  target  women,  enabling \nthem  to  understand  the  need  for  economic  use  of  water,  maintenance  of  water  quality,  and \npayment of water tariffs. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in CBOs in low-income \ncommunities. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project-supported training \nprograms,  recruitment, and  employment  in  construction.  Core  labor  standards,  including  equal \nwages  for  women  and  men  for  work  of  equal  value,  will  be  ensured.  Resources  have  been \nallocated for the implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan.   \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n with  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  one \n\nThe  PAM  outlines  the  detailed  implementation  arrangements for  safeguards. The  PMU \n25. \nwill contain a safeguard implementation unit staffed with two officials: one environmental officer \nand  one  social  and  gender  officer.  The  safeguard  implementation  unit  will  be  assisted  by \nsafeguard  specialists  from  among  the  management  and  supervision  consultants  to  implement \nsafeguards.  \n \nEnvironmental  safeguards  (category  B).  Two  initial  environmental  examinations \n26. \n(IEEs) 21\nfor  distribution  network \nimprovements  and  one for  the  new WTP  with  associated  works,  were  prepared  as  part  of the \nfeasibility study in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government \nlaws.  The  documents  were  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  and  relevant  information  disclosed  to \nproject  communities.  The  IEEs,  including  EMPs,  will  be  updated  and  submitted  to  ADB  for \nreview  and  approval  during  detailed  design.  The  IEEs  concluded  that  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  and  any  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  measures \noutlined  in  the  EMPs.  DWASA  developed  a  sewerage  master  plan  with  two  wastewater \nmanagement projects, which will offset the incremental water supply caused by the project. The \nIEEs represent a single, unified document to ensure compliance with the rules and guidelines of \nADB, AFD, EIB, and the government; and will be implemented as a single process regardless of \nthe funding source. Consultant support will ensure that the PMU will have adequate capacity to \nmanage environmental impacts. Environmental reporting to ADB will be done on a semiannual \nbasis. Consultation and public participation will continue throughout project implementation, and \nany  environmental  grievances  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism developed for the project. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  A).  For  works  related  to  output  1,  a  total  of \n27. \n128.2 hectares (ha) of land, consisting of 54.8 ha of government land (including DWASA\u2019s) and \n73.4 ha of privately owned land, will be required for the project. This land acquisition will cause \n1,248  households  (5,342  persons)  to  be  either  physically  or  economically  displaced,  with \nimpacts.  The  project  will  affect \n528 households  (2,259  persons)  experiencing  major \n2,218 households  (9,803  persons)  temporarily  in  the  form  of  employment,  income  from  daily \nlabors,  or  business  activities.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  new  WTP  with \nassociated  works  to  mitigate  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Eight  public \nconsultations  and  a  number  of  focus  group  discussions  were  undertaken  with  the  affected \n\n                                                \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fpeople on the purposes and benefits of the project\u2019s activities and the possible impacts to their \nlivelihood  and  daily  activities.
