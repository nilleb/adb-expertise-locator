I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  both  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Dhaka \nEnvironmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will provide more reliable and improved security of water supply in Dhaka by \ndeveloping a new surface water supply scheme for supply augmentation, which includes the \ndevelopment of a water intake at Meghna River, a raw water transmission pipeline, a water \ntreatment plant (WTP) at Gandharbpur with capacity of 500 million liters per day (MLD), a \ntreated  water  transmission  pipeline  to  the  existing  water  supply  network,  and  distribution \nreinforcements.  The  project  will  also  include  distribution  network  improvements  to  reduce \nnonrevenue water (NRW); and will improve the quality of water supply services, including \nsupport to low-income communities.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Water security. The government has set a target of providing safe water coverage and \nfull sanitation throughout the country by 2015. However, achieving and sustaining this target \nremains a major challenge, with population growth in urban areas much higher than the national \naverage.3 Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) provides water supply to \nabout 90% of the population of 10.7 million in its service areas of about 400 square kilometers \n(km2), but is unable to provide sufficient quality and quantity of water to its beneficiaries despite \ncontinual efforts for improvements.4 It plans to expand its service areas to about 500 km2 by \n2020 and 600 km2 by 2035, with a projected population of about 29 million. This requires \nsignificant capital investments to increase the level of supply, while ensuring long-term water \nsecurity.   \n \n4.  Environmental sustainability. DWASA has been relying heavily on groundwater as a \nsource of water supply,5 but current abstraction is beyond sustainable yields. Groundwater \nresources are depleting, and the water table is falling by 2\u20133 meters per year, which makes the \nlifetime of deep tube wells shorter, with 40\u201360 deep tube wells becoming inoperable each year. \nGroundwater extraction needs to be reduced from 1,900 MLD in 2012 to 1,360 MLD by 2020 \nand 1,260 MLD by 2025, when the overall supply needs to be increased to cater to the growing \npopulation in larger service areas. The main existing source of surface water is also being \npolluted rapidly. Out of the total 2,400 MLD currently provided by DWASA, 450 MLD is provided \nby the Saidabad WTP, which abstracts surface water from the nearby Sitalakhya River. The \nriver water quality is deteriorating, particularly in terms of high ammonia concentration during \nthe dry season owing to uncontrolled industrial effluent discharges into the river. The ammonia \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.  \n3  Urban population growth was 2.81% per annum in 2005\u20132010, higher than the country\u2019s population growth of \n1.12% during the same period. Dhaka city\u2019s population was 9.3 million in 2011, with an annual growth rate of 4.2% \nover 2001\u20132011.   \n4  Average hours of water supply in DWASA service areas are 22.5 hours per day, but supply hours are limited to 14\u2013\n15 hours per day in zones 4 and 10. \n5  Dependence on groundwater was about 90% until 2012. With the commencement of operation of the Saidabad \nWTP phase 2 with capacity of 225 MLD in December 2012, groundwater dependence has been reduced to about \n80%.   \n ", "2 \nconcentration  is  becoming  higher  than  the  design  standard  that  a  pre-treatment  unit  can \nsatisfactorily treat to an acceptable level\u2014putting the sustainable operation of the WTP at \nserious risk. This makes it essential for DWASA to find an adequate and sustainable source of \nraw water for achieving its long-term development objectives. Meghna River will be a new \nsource of water supply for Dhaka, which has good water quality and ample quantity even during \nthe dry season.     \n \n5.   Efficiency improvements. DWASA is implementing distribution network improvements \nfor water supply with Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing.6 The ongoing investments are \nrehabilitating and strengthening the water supply systems based on the long-term policy and \ninvestment road map, complemented by capacity building of DWASA to manage the water \nsupply systems competently. Six contract packages have been awarded to reduce NRW to 15% \nin each district metered area in five out of 11 zones of the DWASA service area by 2015\u20132016. \n  \n6.  Reforms in progress. Sector reform is proceeding under the partnership framework \nbetween the government and development partners, supported by the ongoing ADB-financed \nproject  (footnote  6).7 Major  achievements  regarding  DWASA\u2019s  management  improvement \ninclude (i) an annual tariff increase of 5% every year since 2007; (ii) implementation of a 5-year \ncapacity building program for over 800 staff in areas including financial management, operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and billing and accounting; (iii) rationalization of staff evidenced by the \nreduction  in  the  ratio  of  staff  per  1,000  connections  from  17  in  2007  to  12  in  2012; \n(iv) development  of  a  5-year  business  plan  in  2011  and  annual  update  thereafter; \n(v) computerization of the water connections database of about 310,000 customers; (vi) a fully \ncomputerized billing system; and (vii) a reduction in NRW from 36% in 2007 to about 30% in \n2012. As a result, DWASA recovers not only full O&M costs but also repayment of principal and \npayment of interest. \n \n7.  These efficiency gains and policy reforms need to be scaled up and sustained, including \nNRW reductions in other zones. While the overall efficiency of the system is being improved, \ndeveloping  a  new  source  of  raw  water  for  long-term  water  security  in  Dhaka  is  essential \nbecause of the large increase in demand associated with a growing population, the need for \nmoving toward continuous water supply, and the need for reducing dependence on groundwater \nand ensuring the sustainable operation of existing surface water supply systems. Access to safe \nwater should be provided to low-income communities, as women in low-income communities \nspend a significant amount of time collecting water for household use and the poor pay a higher \ncost for water from water vendors or through non-regularized water connections.  \n \n8.  Lessons.  The  project  reflects  lessons  and  recommendations  from  previous \ninterventions. Given the importance of improving efficiency, highlighted in the evaluation study, \nNRW reduction is actively being pursued prior to the supply augmentation.8 Project cofinancing \nhas been pursued in line with a conclusion of the post-evaluation that scaling up interventions \nthrough cofinancing is a good option.9 AFD and the European Investment Bank (EIB) will \ncofinance the project. The project is fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan and \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007.

The project will also address key thematic \ndrivers of the CPS, including environmental sustainability and partnerships.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved access to and quality of sustainable water supply services \nin Dhaka. The outcome will be more reliable and improved security of water supply in Dhaka.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Output 1: New surface water supply system developed. A raw water intake will be \ndeveloped at Meghna River, about 30 kilometers (km) east of Dhaka, with structures and a \npumping station having capacity to provide a total of 2,000 MLD of raw water.11 Equipment such \nas pumps will be procured for 525 MLD only for the first phase of a new WTP at Gandharbpur. \nThe Gandharbpur WTP, located about 10 km east of Dhaka, will be constructed with production \ncapacity of 500 MLD. A raw water transmission pipeline from the intake to the WTP will also be \nconstructed.12 The project also includes a treated water transmission pipeline from the WTP to \nthe injection point of the existing distribution network and distribution reinforcements. The WTP \nwill serve the population of about 3 million in Badda, Gulshan, Mirpur, and Uttara (whole zones \n5, 8, and 9; and part of zones 4 and 10). A design\u2013build contract will incentivize design \ninnovation, and ensure an integrated design and operation from the intake to the WTP. The \nsame contractor will be engaged in the first 3 years of operation to prove the functionality, and \nbuild the capacity of DWASA personnel to manage and operate the facilities.   \n \n11.  Output 2: Distribution network strengthened. As a continuation of the ongoing efforts \ntoward NRW reduction, distribution network improvements will be implemented in zone 6 of \nDWASA\u2019s service areas. New or regularized connections at community or household levels will \nbe  provided  in  low-income  communities  in  this  zone  under  DWASA\u2019s  existing  pro-poor \ncommunity support scheme. Public awareness-raising programs will be conducted to strengthen \nunderstanding on water use and conservation, customer services, metered connections, and \nbilling systems. The capacity of DWASA in engaging and supporting low-income communities \nwill be strengthened. At the same time, feasibility studies and preparation of bid documents will \nbe undertaken for distribution network improvements in two densely populated zones in the \nDWASA  service  area  (zones  1  and  2)  to  complete  the  distribution  network  improvement \nworks.13  \n \n12.  Output 3: Project management and administration adequately supported. Support \nwill be provided for smooth and effective project implementation and operation by the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) in DWASA. A new PMU for the project was established in May 2013, \nwith  core  staff  appointed.  A  project  coordination  unit  in  zone  6  will  be  involved  in  the \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2011. Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, \n2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n11 The final capacity of the intake is 2,000 MLD\u20141,050 MLD for Gandharbpur WTP (including the second phase of \n500 MLD) and 950 MLD for Saidabad WTP (for the existing 450 MLD and the third phase of 450 MLD). A safety \nmargin of 5% has been added for the capacity of the intake for both WTPs. The Saidabad WTP plans to change \nthe source of raw water from Sitalakhya River to Meghna River in the future.  \n12 Land required for raw water transmission pipelines for both WTPs will be acquired under the project.  \n13 Under the ongoing ADB-financed project (footnote 6), network improvement is ongoing in five zones (3, 4, 5, 8, and \n10), and bid documents were prepared for two more zones (6 and 9). The proposed project will cover zone 6 and \nprepare bid documents for two more zones. The remaining two zones are in Narayanganj district and nearby (zone \n7), where the network system is relatively new.   \n ", "4 \nimplementation of output 2 to ensure a smooth transfer and successful O&M after project \ncompletion. As the nature and project areas of outputs 1 and 2 are distinct, two teams of \nmanagement and supervision consultants will be engaged. Three teams of nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will be engaged to facilitate the implementation of resettlement plans and \nassist in awareness-raising and community-related tasks.   \n \n13.  With  the  implementation  of  the  project,  groundwater  abstraction  is  expected  to  be \nreduced  by  150  MLD.  DWASA  targets  to  increase  the  overall  surface  water  supply  to \n1,900 MLD (including 500 MLD from this project) by 2021, which accounts for nearly 60% of the \ntotal water supply. Regarding wastewater management, DWASA approved a sewerage master \nplan in 2012, and its implementation will amply treat the incremental amount of wastewater \ngenerated by the project.    \n \nD.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR164,986,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will \nhave a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  and  project  agreements.  The  loan  from  ADB  will  finance  (i)  part  of  civil  works  and \nequipment costs, (ii) consulting services, (iii) incremental recurrent staff costs, and (iv) financing \ncharges during construction. The government has also requested AFD and EIB to jointly finance \na part of civil works and equipment costs with a loan equivalent of $100 million from each \nagency. The government will provide $224.9 million equivalent to cover (i) taxes and duties; \n(ii) land acquisition and resettlement; and (iii) road cutting, power supply, and other expenses \npaid to government agencies.  \n \n16.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n18.  Depleting groundwater resources in and around Dhaka have made the development of a \nnew surface water source essential. As nearby water bodies (such as the Balu, Buriganga, \nSitalakhya, and Turag rivers) are unsuitable because of poor and deteriorating water quality, \nMeghna River has been selected as a new source. Bangladesh\u2019s river morphology is highly \ndynamic, and careful morphological assessments selected the location of the intake site at \nBishnondi,  where  accretion  and  erosion  rates  are  much  lower  than  areas  upstream  and \ndownstream. Technical options recommended in the feasibility study were closely reviewed and \nsome changes proposed through the project preparatory technical assistance: pipeline corridors \nhave been widened to accommodate a paved access road for ease of maintenance as well for \ncommunity use. The raw water intake and WTP, together with a raw water transmission main in \nbetween, will adopt a design\u2013build modality to incentivize design innovation and ensure the \nintegrated design of the three components and their efficient operation.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic analysis. The major benefits of the project will be sustainable water supply \nto  a  growing  population  in  service  areas\u2014including  improved  access,  convenience,  and \nreliability of water supply, as well as increased quantities of water and improved water quality. \nOther indirect benefits arise from the employment of skilled and semiskilled workers in the \nconstruction works. The economic internal rate of return is 20.4%, and the sensitivity analysis \nconfirms the project is viable under adverse conditions. The willingness to pay is substantially \nhigher than the current monthly water expenses, indicating that substantial tariff increases are \neconomically and socially feasible.17 \n \n20.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis of the project focused on assessing its impact \n                                                \n17 The average willingness to pay was Tk11.43 per cubic meter (m3) for domestic use, which is much higher than the \ntariff of Tk7.34/m3 in 2013. The survey was conducted during project preparation.  \n ", "7 \non DWASA\u2019s financial capability to ensure sufficient cash flow at the utility level to cover O&M \ncosts, depreciation, and debt service obligations. The analysis revealed that the current annual \n5% tariff increase would not be sufficient for the medium- to long-term financial sustainability of \nDWASA.18 Assuming a progressive tariff increase beyond 5% from FY2016, based on the tariff \nadjustment  plan  adopted  by  DWASA  in  2011,  DWASA\u2019s  debt  service  coverage  ratio  will \ngenerally remain above 1.0.19 The government has assured an increase beyond 5% by 2015. \nADB, through its technical assistance, is assisting the government in establishing a regulatory \nframework for water supply, which includes the development of a transparent, predictable, and \nindependent tariff-setting mechanism aimed at achieving full cost recovery of water supply \nservices  over  the  long  term. 20  ADB  will  provide  continued  policy  advice  and  capacity \ndevelopment support to facilitate and monitor the development of such a framework.   \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Bangladesh\u2019s overall governance has improved with key governance reforms, including \nthe constitution of the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission in 2004 and the enactment of \nthe Right to Information Act in 2009, the Whistle Blower Protection Act in 2011, and the Money \nLaundering Prevention Act in 2012. A comprehensive national integrity strategy was adopted in \n2012 to address corruption holistically, and strengthen governance institutions in a phased \nmanner. The financial management assessment indicated that DWASA has adequate financial \nmanagement capabilities for implementing the project. The capacity of DWASA\u2019s finance and \naccounting staff will be strengthened through training programs conducted under the project. \nDWASA  has  adequate  capacity  for  procuring  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  in \naccordance with ADB procedures and requirements. The PMU will have one procurement \nofficer and will be supported by consultants in bid preparation and evaluation, particularly for the \ncomplex design\u2013build contract.  \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  DWASA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  In Dhaka, access to water is mainly dependent on household pipe connections and \npublic taps. People living in slums or poor communities generally do not have legal access to \nwater supply and sanitation, as they often live on unauthorized lands without having legal titles. \nThey depend on illegal water lines and pay higher charges. The project will support organizing \ncommunity-based organizations (CBOs), with the assistance of NGOs, to make them eligible for \nlegal water connections. Households in low-income communities, including those headed by \nwomen, will have access to water supply either through legalization or new connections. This \nwill enable the poor to receive water at a lower price through meters. The CBOs will be \nresponsible for payment of water tariffs and maintenance of the community water points. People \nin the intake area will benefit from a deep tube well built by the project, as arsenic is a common \nproblem in shallow tube wells in the area. To enhance awareness on water use, water quality, \nand  public  hygiene,  public  awareness  campaign  activities  will  be  implemented.  Capacity \ndevelopment of the communities will contribute toward sustainability of the benefits. Additionally, \n                                                \n18 Under the Water Supply and Sewerage Act, 1996, DWASA is authorized to increase tariffs up to 5% per annum. \nThe government needs to approve a higher increase.  \n19 This will increase the tariff for domestic use to Tk17.71/m3 in FY2022.  \n20 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nthe poor will benefit from short-term employment opportunities to be generated in construction \nactivities for water supply augmentation and distribution improvement.  \n \n24.  Gender. Expansion of the piped water supply network will benefit women by reducing \ntheir burden to fetch water for the family. They will be able to participate and voice their views in \ndecisions related to water supply in the CBOs. A gender action plan has been prepared. More \nfocused  and  efficient  community  awareness-raising  campaigns  will  target  women,  enabling \nthem to understand the need for economic use of water, maintenance of water quality, and \npayment of water tariffs. Women will be encouraged to play a major role in CBOs in low-income \ncommunities. Women will have an equal opportunity to participate in project-supported training \nprograms, recruitment, and employment in construction. Core labor standards, including equal \nwages for women and men for work of equal value, will be ensured. Resources have been \nallocated for the implementation and monitoring of the gender action plan.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The PAM outlines the detailed implementation arrangements for safeguards. The PMU \nwill contain a safeguard implementation unit staffed with two officials: one environmental officer \nand one social and gender officer. The safeguard implementation unit will be assisted by \nsafeguard specialists from among the management and supervision consultants to implement \nsafeguards.  \n \n26.  Environmental  safeguards  (category  B).  Two  initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEEs) 21  with  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  one  for  distribution  network \nimprovements and one for the new WTP with associated works, were prepared as part of the \nfeasibility study in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government \nlaws. The documents were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website and relevant information disclosed to \nproject communities. The IEEs, including EMPs, will be updated and submitted to ADB for \nreview and approval during detailed design. The IEEs concluded that no significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts are anticipated, and any impacts will be mitigated through measures \noutlined  in  the  EMPs.  DWASA  developed  a  sewerage  master  plan  with  two  wastewater \nmanagement projects, which will offset the incremental water supply caused by the project. The \nIEEs represent a single, unified document to ensure compliance with the rules and guidelines of \nADB, AFD, EIB, and the government; and will be implemented as a single process regardless of \nthe funding source. Consultant support will ensure that the PMU will have adequate capacity to \nmanage environmental impacts. Environmental reporting to ADB will be done on a semiannual \nbasis. Consultation and public participation will continue throughout project implementation, and \nany  environmental  grievances  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism developed for the project. \n \n27.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  For  works  related  to  output  1,  a  total  of \n128.2 hectares (ha) of land, consisting of 54.8 ha of government land (including DWASA\u2019s) and \n73.4 ha of privately owned land, will be required for the project. This land acquisition will cause \n1,248  households  (5,342  persons)  to  be  either  physically  or  economically  displaced,  with \n528 households  (2,259  persons)  experiencing  major  impacts.  The  project  will  affect \n2,218 households (9,803 persons) temporarily in the form of employment, income from daily \nlabors, or business activities. A draft resettlement plan was prepared for the new WTP with \nassociated  works  to  mitigate  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts.  Eight  public \nconsultations and a number of focus group discussions were undertaken with the affected \n                                                \n21 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \npeople on the purposes and benefits of the project\u2019s activities and the possible impacts to their \nlivelihood  and  daily  activities.  Meaningful  consultations  will  continue  with  communities \nthroughout implementation.22 Qualified and reputed NGOs experienced in land acquisition and \nresettlement activities will be recruited to assist DWASA in finalizing and implementing the \nresettlement  plan,  and  in  conducting  community  development,  livelihood,  and  income \nrestoration programs for severely affected and vulnerable households. DWASA will recruit an \nexternal monitoring agency to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the resettlement plan. \nA resettlement framework was prepared for distribution reinforcements as the exact location of \nthe work has not been fixed. A separate resettlement plan was prepared for output 2. No land \nacquisition will be required for these activities, and the temporary impacts that may occur to the \nroadside vendors and hawkers during construction will be mitigated.  \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The social impact assessment confirmed that no \nethnic minorities reside in the project sites. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.
