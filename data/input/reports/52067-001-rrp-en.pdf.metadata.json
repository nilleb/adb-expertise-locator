I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $50,000,000 in Creador IV, L.P. \n \n2.  Creador IV is a private equity fund that seeks to invest predominantly growth capital in the \nform of equity into middle market companies in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri \nLanka, and Viet Nam.1 Focus sectors include financial services, consumer goods and services \n(including healthcare), business services and potentially manufacturing. The Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) investment will help to further deepen the capital markets in the South Asian and \nSoutheast Asian countries for middle market companies who often struggle to access appropriate \ngrowth capital. Moreover, ADB will help the general partner to further enhance its environmental \nand social management system (ESMS), having initially guided the prior fund Creador III L.P. \ndevelop its ESMS when ADB invested in the fund in 2015. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Description. Creador represents, as a group, a regional private equity fund manager that \ninvests in companies located or with significant business activities in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.2 Creador was established in 2011 by its chief executive \nofficer (CEO) Brahmal Vasudevan, a seasoned private equity investment professional formerly of \nChrysCapital, one of the largest private equity firms in India. Since inception, Creador has raised \nthree funds totaling $880 million in committed capital, investing approximately $875 million across \n29 investments as of 31 March 2018.3 In this 8-year period, Creador has become one of the \nleading private equity fund managers in the region, having developed in-depth market knowledge \nand domain expertise within its targeted sectors, including financial services, consumer goods \nand services (including healthcare), and business services. Creador employs 37 investment \nprofessionals who are based in Chennai, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur.  \n \n4.  Creador is raising its fourth private equity fund, Creador IV L.P., a Mauritius limited \npartnership with a target capitalization of $500 million. Creador Management IV Limited, a limited \nlife company established in Mauritius, is the general partner of Creador IV. The general partner \nhas delegated some of its duties to three investment advisory companies under investment \nadvisory agreements.4  \n \n5.  Investment identification. ADB is an existing investor in Creador III L.P., a $418.6 million \nfund raised in 2015 in which ADB committed $40.9 million. Through its market-mapping of private \nequity funds investing regionally in South Asia and Southeast Asia, ADB shortlisted only five fund \nmanagers, including Creador, based on the quality of their management and investment teams, \ninvestment strategies, alignment with ADB\u2019s mandate, operational capabilities, and performance \ntrack records.  \n \n \n1  Middle market refers to companies and/or corporates with a pre-money enterprise value of up to $750 million. \n2  Creador Management Company I Limited, Creador Management Company II Limited and Creador Management III \nLimited, which were the general partners of, and managed and operated Creador\u2019s previous funds, are collectively \nreferred to as Creador. Each entity is established as a limited life company in Mauritius. \n3  Invested amount includes set aside capital. \n4  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "2    \n6.  Led by its founder Brahmal Vasudevan, Creador has successfully implemented a regional, \nmiddle-market-focused investment strategy across South Asia and Southeast Asia (footnote 2). \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto  Information  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)]. 5 Given  its  strong  track  record,  Creador  has  been \ncontinuously supported through successive fund vintages by several high-quality institutional \ninvestors. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Leveraging Brahmal Vasudevan\u2019s experience \nand professional networks in Southeast Asia and India, and the business relationships of other \nsenior management team members, Creador has sourced more than 70% of its investments on \na proprietary basis. Proprietary opportunities tend to be more attractive than auction processes \nsince Creador is negotiating directly with the promoters. \n \n7.  In 2013, Creador established Creador+, a dedicated operations platform that focuses on \nadding strategic and operational value to Creador\u2019s portfolio companies. Creador+ works closely \nwith the management of portfolio companies to conduct extensive market and financial analysis, \nextract business insights, develop strategies to further improve growth and profitability, and \nsecure attractive exit opportunities. This is a key value proposition that Creador can offer its \ninvestee companies. \n \n8.  Importantly, Creador has invested in companies that offer significant developmental \nbenefits. Examples include Hermina (Indonesia\u2019s second largest hospital chain that focuses on \nthe emerging middle class with core expertise in mother and child care), Ujjivan (a small finance \nbank in India with strong positioning in microfinance), and Mr. DIY in Malaysia and Mobile World \nGroup  in  Viet  Nam  (both  large,  growing  retail  chains  with  strong  employment  generation \npotential). ADB recently participated in Hermina\u2019s initial public offering as an anchor investor, an \nindication  that  Creador  invests  in  companies  that  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  development \nmandate. Hermina was classified gender equity because it will directly improve access of women \nto quality health care.  Based on the above factors, Creador continues to rank highly relative to \nits direct competitors in terms of management team quality and depth, in-house operational \nexpertise, performance track record, regional reach, and access to deals. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  Creador IV is a targeted $500 million closed-end private equity fund that aims to make \n10\u201312 investments averaging $10 million\u2013$50 million each in established companies pursuing \ntheir next phase of growth in South Asia and Southeast Asia, with a focus on India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Targeted sectors include financial services, \nconsumer goods and services (including health care), and business services. The fund may also \nselectively consider investments in the manufacturing sector. Creador\u2019s preference is to invest \nand acquire minority stakes, although in certain cases it will consider investing and acquiring \ncontrolling stakes if there is commercial justification. The fund may also commit a portion of ADB\u2019s \ncapital towards listed companies, including private investments in public equities (PIPEs), partly \nto create early liquidity opportunities for investors. Creador IV\u2019s holding period for each investment \nis expected to be between 2 and 5 years, consistent with the holding periods for investments in \nCreador\u2019s previous funds. \n \n10.  Creador focuses on minority growth capital investments because most businesses in \nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia tend to be family owned, where promoter groups are unwilling to \n \n5   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. ", "  3 \ndilute their stakes substantially to raise equity capital. Instead, in Creador\u2019s experience, these \nfamily-owned companies prefer to partner with an experienced minority investor like Creador that \nis strategically and commercially aligned and can offer operational expertise to create further \nvalue in the business. Given its entrenched local presence, the Creador team is well-positioned \nto develop relationships with and eventually invest in family-owned, high-quality companies that \nmay be facing managerial, operational, or financial constraints on growth, and require the skills \nand capital of a financial investor to unlock additional value. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n12.  Integrity due diligence and enhanced tax integrity due diligence were conducted.6 Having \nreviewed the transaction, ADB does not believe it is being used for cross-border tax evasion, \nmoney laundering, or terrorism financing (footnote 4). \n \n13.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n14.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n15.  Creador seeks representation on the boards of its investee companies to provide strategic \nand operational guidance. Investment professionals from Creador have held at least one board \nand/or board observer seat in the portfolio companies of prior funds. \n \n16.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n17.  Post-investment, the Creador+ team actively engages with the investee companies in \nareas where Creador\u2019s due diligence has identified areas of growth and improvement. These \nareas could include strategic planning, cost minimization, optimization of supply chain and \ndistribution  channels,  streamlining  accounting  and finance functions, talent  acquisition,  and \ncapital raising. Moreover, Creador+ regularly tracks the operational and financial data of portfolio \ncompanies. The initial Creador+ engagement is typically for the first 3\u20136 months after Creador\u2019s \ninvestment. During this time, Creador+ works closely with the management team of the investee \ncompany to establish short- and long-term business targets and/or finalizes operating budgets. \nDepending on the progress of the initial engagement and extent of gaps identified, and particularly \nif a business is underperforming, Creador+ continues to be actively involved in managing the \ncompany\u2019s  operations  and  will  usually  deploy  its  own  staff  to  the  portfolio  company  until \nperformance is in line with targets. \n \n18.  Advisory board. Creador IV will form an advisory board with the primary role of providing \noversight on governance and conflict of interest matters. Consistent with Creador III, ADB will \nhave a seat on the advisory board. \n \n \n6  ADB. 2003.

The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $50,000,000 in Creador IV. ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment will not exceed 25% of Creador IV\u2019s aggregate committed capital and will not result in \nADB being the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n21.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Exit strategy. Creador IV will have a 10-year term from initial closing, which may be \nextended by two 1-year extensions. The anticipated exit strategies for the fund\u2019s investments \ninclude public offerings, trade sales of portfolio companies to local and foreign strategic buyers, \nand secondary sales to other private equity funds. \n \n23.  Reporting arrangements. Creador will provide ADB with quarterly reports and audited \nannual financial statements, an annual valuation, an overview of the portfolio with brief information \non each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation, an annual development effectiveness \nmonitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report. ADB will review this \ninformation and follow up with the general partner if more information or clarification is needed. If \nthe information received from the general partner raises issues that could impair the value of \nADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent \nreview and closer attention. \n \n24.  Creador  IV  will  report  annually  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  in \ncompliance with its environmental and social management system (ESMS). ADB will monitor the \ntiming and quality of the safeguards reports and offer guidance if the general partner requires \nclarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Catalyzing  private  sector  investment.  Middle-market  companies  constitute  a \nspecialized segment within the private equity asset class, with limited access to capital from \ninstitutional investors. ADB\u2019s participation in Creador IV is expected to further raise the visibility \nof the capital needs in Creador\u2019s targeted core sectors and market segments, which should help \n \n7  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. ", "  5 \ncatalyze institutional and noninstitutional participation in other private equity funds investing in \nmiddle-market companies in South Asia and Southeast Asian markets. \n \n26.  Raising  standards.  Creador  will  be  required  to  continue  to  implement  an  ESMS \nacceptable to ADB that requires it to oblige its portfolio companies to comply with ADB\u2019s \nenvironment and social safeguard requirements and report to ADB on development indicators. \nADB was instrumental in helping Creador develop its ESMS as a requirement of its investment in \nCreador III L.P. fund, prior to which Creador did not have a functional ESMS. In addition, ADB will \nprovide oversight on important governance matters, which are critical for investee companies to \ndemonstrate as they seek additional sources of growth capital.  \n \n27.  Cofinancing opportunities. Creador values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing directly to its portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital from \nits own balance sheet, ADB can also help mobilize additional financing from third-party sources. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n28.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n36.  Impact. The equity investment is aligned with the following impact: Established, well-\nmanaged, middle-market companies in South Asia and Southeast Asia are supported to realize \ntheir growth plans, thereby driving employment, tax generation, skills transfer, and regional trade. \n \n ", "6    \n37.  Outcome. The equity investment will have the following outcome: Financial and social \nsustainability of private equity investments in South Asia and Southeast Asia demonstrated.9 \n \n38.  Outputs. Creador IV is established, and capital is invested among 10\u201312 companies \nwithin the proposed 5-year investment period. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n39.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment in Creador IV aligns strongly \nwith operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 These include (i) addressing poverty \nand reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs and achieving better health for all, and (ii) \nfostering  regional  cooperation  by  enhancing  connectivity  and  strengthening  finance  sector \ncooperation.  Strategy  2030  also  supports  expanding  private  sector  operations,  including \nexpanding regional reach through private equity funds, supporting greater financial inclusion, \nstrengthening the finance sector in capital markets, diversifying into other sectors, and widening \ngeographic coverage. As a regional platform, Creador is uniquely positioned to deliver on Strategy \n2030 themes through investments such as Ujjivan and Cholamandalam in India that promote \nfinancial inclusion, Hermina (Indonesia) and Paras (India) that are delivering affordable health \ncare targeting lower and emerging middle-income populations, and CTOS (Malaysia) and Mr. DIY \n(Malaysia), which are companies that Creador is helping to expand regionally. \n \n40.  Consistency with country strategy. The investment in Creador IV is consistent with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019, which prioritizes inclusive growth \nby improving job creation, deepening capital markets, and investing in financial infrastructure.11 \nThe investment is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, \nwhich highlights fostering regional cooperation and supporting the manufacturing, health, and \neducation sectors as strategic priorities.12 Similarly, the proposed investment is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam,  2016\u20132020,  which  places  emphasis  on \npromoting  job  creation  and  competitiveness,  supporting  small  and  medium-sized  business \nenterprises, and improving access to services.13 \n \n41.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan for Health, 2015\u20132020 strongly supports private sector approaches to address quality, \nefficiency, and financing issues in the health sector.14 By investing in Creador IV, ADB is \npartnering with a leading regional fund manager that has identified health care as one of its core \nsectors.  Recent  health  care  investments  by  Creador  include  Corona  Remedies  (generic \npharmaceuticals manufacturer) and Paras Healthcare (affordable tertiary hospital chain operator) \nin India, and Hermina (hospital chain operator specializing in maternal and child health) in \nIndonesia. \n \n \n \n \n10  ADB. 2018.

The project is classified category FI for impacts on environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The fund\u2019s \npotential environmental and social impacts, the risks associated with its existing and likely future \nportfolio, and its commitment and capacity for environmental and social management have been \nassessed as part of the safeguards due diligence process. The fund\u2019s business activities are \nexpected  to  be  similar  to  Creador  III  L.P.  and  are  not  expected  to  generate  significant \nenvironmental and social impacts or risks, require involuntary resettlement, or adversely or \nbeneficially affect distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority communities. \n \n43.  Creador\u2019s  existing  ESMS  applies  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  has \nprocedures in place to screen, assess, and address environmental and social risks of investee \ncompanies, and has provisions requiring the fund to oblige investee companies to operate in \naccordance with applicable national laws and regulations and to implement any corrective action \nplan, if appropriate.15  To strengthen the fund\u2019s ESMS implementation, Creador committed to (i) \nimprove data collection and management of compliance of investee companies with all applicable \nnational laws during the due diligence and monitoring stages of the project, (ii) submit relevant \nenvironmental and social due diligence documentation and annual environmental and social \nreports to ADB in a timely manner, (iii) promptly report to ADB any incidents and potential \nnoncompliances from portfolio companies, and (iv) prepare an environmental and social training \nprogram tailored to the needs of the organization. ADB will have an excuse right to be excepted \nfrom  contributing  capital  to  any  investment  classified  as  category  A  (for  all  safeguard \nclassifications) and any proposed investment that it assesses as being noncompliant with the \nESMS. The ESMS sets out requirements for compliance, as applicable, with national labor laws \nand measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). The ESMS also contains requirements, as applicable, \nfor information disclosure and consultation with affected people.  \n  \n44.  The proposed investment in Creador IV has been categorized as having no gender \nelements. This is primarily because the fund will invest in a portfolio of companies that are yet to \nbe identified, hence gender indicators for these as-yet-unknown investee companies are difficult \nto define at this stage. As in the past, ADB will continue to encourage Creador to focus on gender \ninvestments in the fund. ADB is, therefore, confident that Creador IV will seek out investments \nlike Hermina, which was categorized gender equity when ADB invested in this company in May \n2018. As such, we expect Creador IV to generate significant gender benefits in Creador\u2019s target \nmarkets.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n45.  Creador was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n \n15  Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) explains ADB\u2019s requirements and provides further details in relation to such \nrequirements for publicly listed companies. \n ", "8    \nC.

Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the government of the \nmember countries of ADB where the fund will invest have no objection to the proposed assistance \nto Creador IV. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n48.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $50,000,000, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in Creador IV, L.P., \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n3 September 2018 \n \n \n16 ADB. 1966.
