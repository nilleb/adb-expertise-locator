The Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) investment will help to further deepen the capital markets in the South Asian and \nSoutheast Asian countries for middle market companies who often struggle to access appropriate \ngrowth capital. Moreover, ADB will help the general partner to further enhance its environmental \nand  social  management  system  (ESMS),  having  initially  guided  the  prior  fund  Creador  III  L.P. \ndevelop its ESMS when ADB invested in the fund in 2015. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\n \nInvestment Identification and Description \n\nA. \n \n3. \nDescription. Creador represents, as a group, a regional private equity fund manager that \ninvests in companies located or with significant business activities in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.2 Creador was established in 2011 by its chief executive \nofficer (CEO) Brahmal Vasudevan, a seasoned private equity investment professional formerly of \nChrysCapital, one of the largest private equity firms in India. Since inception, Creador has raised \nthree funds totaling $880 million in committed capital, investing approximately $875 million across \n29  investments  as  of  31  March  2018.3 In  this  8-year  period,  Creador  has  become  one  of  the \nleading private equity fund managers in the region, having developed in-depth market knowledge \nand  domain  expertise  within  its  targeted  sectors,  including  financial  services, consumer  goods \nand  services  (including  healthcare),  and  business  services.  Creador  employs  37  investment \nprofessionals who are based in Chennai, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur.  \n \n4. \nCreador  is  raising  its  fourth  private  equity  fund,  Creador  IV  L.P.,  a  Mauritius  limited \npartnership with a target capitalization of $500 million. Creador Management IV Limited, a limited \nlife company established in Mauritius, is the general partner of Creador IV. The general partner \nhas  delegated  some  of  its  duties  to  three  investment  advisory  companies  under  investment \nadvisory agreements.4  \n \n5. \nInvestment identification. ADB is an existing investor in Creador III L.P., a $418.6 million \nfund raised in 2015 in which ADB committed $40.9 million. Through its market-mapping of private \nequity funds investing regionally in South Asia and Southeast Asia, ADB shortlisted only five fund \nmanagers, including Creador, based on the quality of their management and investment teams, \ninvestment strategies, alignment with ADB\u2019s mandate, operational capabilities, and performance \ntrack records.  \n \n\n \n\n1  Middle market refers to companies and/or corporates with a pre-money enterprise value of up to $750 million. \n2   Creador Management Company I Limited, Creador Management Company II Limited and Creador Management III \nLimited, which were the general partners of, and managed and operated Creador\u2019s previous funds, are collectively \nreferred to as Creador. Each entity is established as a limited life company in Mauritius. \n\n3  Invested amount includes set aside capital. \n4   [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n\f2  \n\n \n\nLed by its founder Brahmal Vasudevan, Creador has successfully implemented a regional, \n6. \nmiddle-market-focused investment strategy across South Asia and Southeast Asia (footnote 2). \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access \nto  Information  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)]. 5  Given  its  strong  track  record,  Creador  has  been \ncontinuously  supported  through  successive  fund  vintages  by  several  high-quality  institutional \ninvestors.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in \nADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Leveraging Brahmal Vasudevan\u2019s experience \nand professional networks in Southeast Asia and India, and the business relationships of other \nsenior management team members, Creador has sourced more than 70% of its investments on \na proprietary basis. Proprietary opportunities tend to be more attractive than auction processes \nsince Creador is negotiating directly with the promoters. \n \nIn 2013, Creador established Creador+, a dedicated operations platform that focuses on \n7. \nadding strategic and operational value to Creador\u2019s portfolio companies. Creador+ works closely \nwith the management of portfolio companies to conduct extensive market and financial analysis, \nextract  business  insights,  develop  strategies  to  further  improve  growth  and  profitability,  and \nsecure  attractive  exit  opportunities.  This  is  a  key  value  proposition  that  Creador  can  offer  its \ninvestee companies. \n \n8. \nImportantly,  Creador  has  invested  in  companies  that  offer  significant  developmental \nbenefits. Examples include Hermina (Indonesia\u2019s second largest hospital chain that focuses on \nthe emerging middle class with core expertise in mother and child care), Ujjivan (a small finance \nbank in India with strong positioning in microfinance), and Mr. DIY in Malaysia and Mobile World \nGroup  in  Viet  Nam  (both  large,  growing  retail  chains  with  strong  employment  generation \npotential). ADB recently participated in Hermina\u2019s initial public offering as an anchor investor, an \nindication  that  Creador  invests  in  companies  that  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  development \nmandate. Hermina was classified gender equity because it will directly improve access of women \nto quality health care.  Based on the above factors, Creador continues to rank highly relative to \nits  direct  competitors  in  terms  of  management  team  quality  and  depth,  in-house  operational \nexpertise, performance track record, regional reach, and access to deals. \n \nB. \n \n9. \nCreador IV is a targeted $500 million closed-end private equity fund that aims to make \n10\u201312  investments  averaging  $10  million\u2013$50  million  each  in  established  companies  pursuing \ntheir next phase of growth in South Asia and Southeast Asia, with a focus on India, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. Targeted sectors include financial services, \nconsumer goods and services (including health care), and business services. The fund may also \nselectively consider investments in the manufacturing sector. Creador\u2019s preference is to invest \nand  acquire  minority  stakes,  although  in  certain  cases  it  will  consider  investing  and  acquiring \ncontrolling stakes if there is commercial justification. The fund may also commit a portion of ADB\u2019s \ncapital towards listed companies, including private investments in public equities (PIPEs), partly \nto create early liquidity opportunities for investors. Creador IV\u2019s holding period for each investment \nis expected to be between 2 and 5 years, consistent with the holding periods for investments in \nCreador\u2019s previous funds. \n \n10. \nCreador  focuses  on  minority  growth  capital  investments  because  most  businesses  in \nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia tend to be family owned, where promoter groups are unwilling to \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n5   [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\ndilute  their  stakes  substantially  to  raise  equity  capital.  Instead,  in  Creador\u2019s  experience,  these \nfamily-owned companies prefer to partner with an experienced minority investor like Creador that \nis  strategically  and  commercially  aligned  and  can  offer  operational  expertise  to  create  further \nvalue in the business. Given its entrenched local presence, the Creador team is well-positioned \nto develop relationships with and eventually invest in family-owned, high-quality companies that \nmay be facing managerial, operational, or financial constraints on growth, and require the skills \nand capital of a financial investor to unlock additional value. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nIntegrity due diligence and enhanced tax integrity due diligence were conducted.6 Having \n12. \nreviewed  the  transaction,  ADB  does  not  believe  it  is  being  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion, \nmoney laundering, or terrorism financing (footnote 4). \n \n13. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n14. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n15. \nCreador seeks representation on the boards of its investee companies to provide strategic \nand operational guidance. Investment professionals from Creador have held at least one board \nand/or board observer seat in the portfolio companies of prior funds. \n \n16. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n17. \nPost-investment,  the  Creador+  team  actively  engages  with  the  investee  companies  in \nareas  where  Creador\u2019s  due  diligence  has  identified  areas  of  growth  and  improvement.  These \nareas  could  include  strategic  planning,  cost  minimization,  optimization  of  supply  chain  and \ndistribution  channels,  streamlining  accounting  and  finance  functions,  talent  acquisition,  and \ncapital raising. Moreover, Creador+ regularly tracks the operational and financial data of portfolio \ncompanies. The initial Creador+ engagement is typically for the first 3\u20136 months after Creador\u2019s \ninvestment. During this time, Creador+ works closely with the management team of the investee \ncompany to establish short- and long-term business targets and/or finalizes operating budgets. \nDepending on the progress of the initial engagement and extent of gaps identified, and particularly \nif  a  business  is  underperforming,  Creador+  continues  to  be  actively  involved  in  managing  the \ncompany\u2019s  operations  and  will  usually  deploy  its  own  staff  to  the  portfolio  company  until \nperformance is in line with targets. \n \nAdvisory board. Creador IV will form an advisory board with the primary role of providing \n18. \noversight  on  governance  and  conflict  of  interest  matters.  Consistent  with  Creador  III,  ADB  will \nhave a seat on the advisory board. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n6   ADB. 2003.

Creador  IV  will  have  a  10-year  term  from  initial  closing,  which  may  be \n22. \nextended  by  two  1-year  extensions.  The  anticipated  exit  strategies  for  the  fund\u2019s  investments \ninclude public offerings, trade sales of portfolio companies to local and foreign strategic buyers, \nand secondary sales to other private equity funds. \n \n23. \nReporting arrangements. Creador will provide ADB with quarterly reports and audited \nannual financial statements, an annual valuation, an overview of the portfolio with brief information \non each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation, an annual development effectiveness \nmonitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report. ADB will review this \ninformation and follow up with the general partner if more information or clarification is needed. If \nthe  information  received  from  the  general  partner  raises  issues  that  could  impair  the  value  of \nADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent \nreview and closer attention. \n \n24. \nCreador  IV  will  report  annually  on  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues  in \ncompliance with its environmental and social management system (ESMS). ADB will monitor the \ntiming  and  quality  of the  safeguards  reports  and  offer  guidance  if  the  general  partner requires \nclarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD. \n \n25. \ninvestment.  Middle-market  companies  constitute  a \nspecialized  segment  within  the  private  equity  asset  class,  with  limited  access  to  capital  from \ninstitutional investors.

Creador  will  be  required  to  continue  to  implement  an  ESMS \nacceptable  to  ADB  that  requires  it  to  oblige  its  portfolio  companies  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment and social safeguard requirements and report to ADB on development indicators. \nADB was instrumental in helping Creador develop its ESMS as a requirement of its investment in \nCreador III L.P. fund, prior to which Creador did not have a functional ESMS. In addition, ADB will \nprovide oversight on important governance matters, which are critical for investee companies to \ndemonstrate as they seek additional sources of growth capital.  \n \n27. \nCofinancing opportunities. Creador values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and equity \nfinancing directly to its portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital from \nits own balance sheet, ADB can also help mobilize additional financing from third-party sources. \n \nE. \n \n28. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n29. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n30. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n31. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n32. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n33. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n34. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n35. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \n36. \nImpact.  The  equity  investment  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Established,  well-\nmanaged, middle-market companies in South Asia and Southeast Asia are supported to realize \ntheir growth plans, thereby driving employment, tax generation, skills transfer, and regional trade. \n \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\n \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\nOutputs.  Creador  IV  is  established,  and  capital  is  invested  among  10\u201312  companies \n\nOutcome.  The  equity  investment  will  have  the  following  outcome:  Financial  and  social \n\n37. \nsustainability of private equity investments in South Asia and Southeast Asia demonstrated.9 \n \n38. \nwithin the proposed 5-year investment period. \n \nB. \n \nConsistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment in Creador IV aligns strongly \n39. \nwith operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.10 These include (i) addressing poverty \nand reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs and achieving better health for all, and (ii) \nfostering  regional  cooperation  by  enhancing  connectivity  and  strengthening  finance  sector \ncooperation.  Strategy  2030  also  supports  expanding  private  sector  operations,  including \nexpanding  regional  reach  through  private  equity  funds,  supporting  greater  financial  inclusion, \nstrengthening the finance sector in capital markets, diversifying into other sectors, and widening \ngeographic coverage. As a regional platform, Creador is uniquely positioned to deliver on Strategy \n2030  themes  through  investments  such  as  Ujjivan  and  Cholamandalam  in  India  that  promote \nfinancial  inclusion,  Hermina  (Indonesia)  and  Paras  (India)  that  are  delivering  affordable  health \ncare targeting lower and emerging middle-income populations, and CTOS (Malaysia) and Mr. DIY \n(Malaysia), which are companies that Creador is helping to expand regionally. \n \n40. \nConsistency  with  country  strategy.  The  investment  in  Creador  IV  is  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019, which prioritizes inclusive growth \nby improving job creation, deepening capital markets, and investing in financial infrastructure. 11 \nThe  investment  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022, \nwhich  highlights  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  supporting  the  manufacturing,  health,  and \neducation sectors as strategic priorities.12 Similarly, the proposed investment is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam,  2016\u20132020,  which  places  emphasis  on \npromoting  job  creation  and  competitiveness,  supporting  small  and  medium-sized  business \nenterprises, and improving access to services.13 \n \n41. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. ADB\u2019s Operational \nPlan  for  Health,  2015\u20132020  strongly  supports  private  sector  approaches  to  address  quality, \nefficiency,  and  financing  issues  in  the  health  sector. 14  By  investing  in  Creador  IV,  ADB  is \npartnering with a leading regional fund manager that has identified health care as one of its core \nsectors.  Recent  health  care  investments  by  Creador  include  Corona  Remedies  (generic \npharmaceuticals manufacturer) and Paras Healthcare (affordable tertiary hospital chain operator) \nin  India,  and  Hermina  (hospital  chain  operator  specializing  in  maternal  and  child  health)  in \nIndonesia. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n10  ADB.  2018.

The  fund\u2019s  business  activities  are \nexpected  to  be  similar  to  Creador  III  L.P.  and  are  not  expected  to  generate  significant \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  or  risks,  require  involuntary  resettlement,  or  adversely  or \nbeneficially affect distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority communities. \n \n43. \nCreador\u2019s  existing  ESMS  applies  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  has \nprocedures in place to screen, assess, and address environmental and social risks of investee \ncompanies,  and  has  provisions  requiring  the  fund  to  oblige  investee  companies  to  operate  in \naccordance with applicable national laws and regulations and to implement any corrective action \nplan, if appropriate.15  To strengthen the fund\u2019s ESMS implementation, Creador committed to (i) \nimprove data collection and management of compliance of investee companies with all applicable \nnational laws during the due diligence and monitoring stages of the project, (ii) submit relevant \nenvironmental  and  social  due  diligence  documentation  and  annual  environmental  and  social \nreports  to  ADB  in  a  timely  manner,  (iii)  promptly  report  to  ADB  any  incidents  and  potential \nnoncompliances from portfolio companies, and (iv) prepare an environmental and social training \nprogram tailored to the needs of the organization. ADB will have an excuse right to be excepted \nfrom  contributing  capital  to  any  investment  classified  as  category  A  (for  all  safeguard \nclassifications)  and  any  proposed  investment  that  it  assesses  as  being  noncompliant  with  the \nESMS. The ESMS sets out requirements for compliance, as applicable, with national labor laws \nand  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to \nADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). The ESMS also contains requirements, as applicable, \nfor information disclosure and consultation with affected people.  \n  \n44. \nThe  proposed  investment  in  Creador  IV  has  been  categorized  as  having  no  gender \nelements. This is primarily because the fund will invest in a portfolio of companies that are yet to \nbe identified, hence gender indicators for these as-yet-unknown investee companies are difficult \nto define at this stage. As in the past, ADB will continue to encourage Creador to focus on gender \ninvestments in the fund. ADB is, therefore, confident that Creador IV will seek out investments \nlike Hermina, which was categorized gender equity when ADB invested in this company in May \n2018. As such, we expect Creador IV to generate significant gender benefits in Creador\u2019s target \nmarkets.  \n \nB. \n \n45. \nCreador was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n15  Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  explains  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  provides  further  details  in  relation  to  such \nrequirements for publicly listed companies. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\n \n\nAssurances \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nC. \n \n46. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),16 \n47. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  government  of  the \nmember countries of ADB where the fund will invest have no objection to the proposed assistance \nto  Creador  IV.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n48. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $50,000,000, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in Creador IV, L.P., \nwith  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n\n3 September 2018 \n \n\n16 ADB. 1966.
