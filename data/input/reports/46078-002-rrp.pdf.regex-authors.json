I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Anhui  Huainan  Urban  Water  Systems \nIntegrated Rehabilitation Project. The report also describes proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund1 under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility for Strengthening Urban Flood Management in Huainan Municipality, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA.2 \n2.  The project is located in Huainan Municipality of Anhui Province. The project will support \nthe  Huainan  municipal  government  (HMG)  in  implementing  components  of  the  Huainan \nMunicipality Master Plan, 2010\u20132020 related to urban water systems.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Huainan spans both banks of Huai River; 87 kilometers (km) of the river flow through the \nmunicipality. The total land area of the municipality is 1,895.4 square kilometers, and the total \npopulation  is  2.46  million.  Inadequate  infrastructure  development,  rapid  urbanization,  and \neconomic development have resulted in a heavy pollution load\u2014mainly caused by domestic \nwastewater and solid waste\u2014to the urban water system, including six urban water channels and \nfive lakes.4 At the same time, flood control capacity of the urban water systems is not sufficient; \nvarious locations in Huainan experience flood damage every year. \n4.  In the urban area of Huainan, two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) serve each of \nthe eastern and western areas of the municipality.5 Huainan Capital Water Company (HCWC) \noperates  the  WWTPs  based  on  a  2004  concession  agreement  with  the  HMG.  During \n2000\u22122011, Huainan increased the sewer system length from 430 km to 679 km. Each of the \ntwo WWTPs has a treatment capacity of 100,000 cubic meters per day (m3/day). However, the \neastern  WWTP  is  treating  only  90,000  m3/day  of  wastewater  and  the  western  WWTP \n73,000 m3/day because the wastewater collection system coverage is still low\u201464% for the \neastern urban area, and 66% for the western urban area. In addition, wastewater generated in \nHuainan has been increasing from 160,000 m3/day in 2009 to 228,000 m3/day in 2011. As a \nresult, the wastewater treatment rate has remained at approximately 75%.  \n5.  Huainan\u2019s  urban  area  is  served  partially  by  a  combined  sewer  system  (CSS)  and \npartially by a sanitary sewer system (SSS). Under the CSS, only a portion of the wastewater \ncollected through combined sewers, together with storm water during floods, is transferred \nthrough urban water channels to the eastern or western WWTPs. Most of the wastewater is \ndirectly discharged to the lakes and Huai River without treatment. Under the SSS, wastewater \ncollected through sanitary sewers is directly transferred to the WWTPs. Water quality in all six \nwater  channels  in  the  urban  area  are  class  V+  because  they  are  used  to  convey  both \nwastewater and storm water. Of the five lakes in the urban area, water quality in Long Lake, \n                                                \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Anhui Huainan Urban Water Systems Integrated Rehabilitation \nProject. Manila. \n4  Untreated industrial wastewater is not being discharged into the urban water channels, lakes, or Huai River. \n5  The urban area is the same as the project area. ", "2 \nDajiangou Wetlands, and Shijian Lake are worse than class IV; and water quality in Gaotang \nLake is class IV.6 Sludge, sediment, and solid waste have accumulated in the channels and \nlakes over time causing increasing deterioration of the urban water and lake environments. \nWhile many of the monitoring points of the Huainan section of Huai River are class III, some \npoints are worse than class III at times.7 \n6.  Huainan has two types of flooding: (i) overflows from Gaotang Lake and Huai River, and \n(ii) urban waterlogging.8 Historically, Huainan has been highly vulnerable to flooding from Huai \nRiver. Various flood control projects are being implemented to control floods, and the Huainan \nsection of Huai River will have flood control capacity for a 1 in 100 year flood by 2015. Huainan \nis  also  vulnerable  to  flooding  from  Gaotang  Lake,  which  occurs  once  every  3\u20134  years, \ninundating areas as extensive as 10 square kilometers. About 22,000 people currently live along \nthe shores of Gaotang Lake. The HMG will develop a new district in this area for an additional \n20,000 people in 2020 and 280,000 in 2030. For most of the urban area in Huainan, storm-\nwater runoff flows through the urban water channels and lakes to Huai River. Pump stations \ndischarge storm water from lakes to Huai River. Currently, many of the urban water channels \nare designed for 1 in 5 year floods. However, the reduced capacity of the urban water channels \ndue to siltation and garbage accumulation, as well as insufficient capacity of the pump stations, \nstill causes waterlogging almost every year. \n7.  To facilitate the development of Huainan, the HMG prepared the Huainan Municipality \nMaster Plan, 2010\u20132020, which was approved by the provincial and central governments. The \nmaster plan sets targets for 2020 for the water environment (water quality in the urban water \nsystems improved to class IV or above) and flood management (storm-water management \nsystem designed to handle 1 in 20 year rain storms).9 The HMG therefore requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  lending  support  to  implement  and  complement \ncomponents of the master plan related to urban water systems.  \n8.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) supports the long-term goal of building \na xiaokang (harmonious and moderately prosperous) society through livelihood improvement, \nand regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable growth.10 ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy,  2011\u20132015 for  the  PRC  supports  the  government\u2019s  overarching  strategic goal of \nbuilding  a  xiaokang  society  by  focusing  on  three  strategic  pillars:  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration.11 The project is \nfully  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (footnote  10)  and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy (footnote 11) by improving the urban water environment, public health, and \nquality of life. ADB will closely follow the PRC government\u2019s new development plan, including \n                                                \n6  Currently, Caoling Lake is filled with fly ash by private companies; and is basically dried up. \n7  Class I water has the highest quality and class V+ water the worst. Class III water is suitable as a supply source for \nmunicipal drinking water treatment and for swimming; class IV is suitable for use as a general industrial water \nsupply and for recreational use involving no direct human contact with the water; class V is suitable only for \nagricultural water supply and general landscaping use; and class V+ is unsuitable for any use (PRC Environmental \nWater Quality Standard GB 3838-2002). \n8  Waterlogging occurs in low-lying areas when storm-water runoff exceeds the capacity of the drainage system. \n9  Main components of the master plan are structural measures; nonstructural measures for water environmental \nimprovement and flood management are not included in the master plan.  \n10 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National People\u2019s Congress. 2011.

ADB has been supporting projects on wastewater treatment, urban development, and \nflood  and  water  resources  management  in  the  PRC  and  other  countries.  Major  lessons \nincorporated  in  the  project  design  are  the  importance  of  (i)  nonstructural  measures  and \ncommunity  participation  for  environmental  improvement  and  flood  management,  and  \n(ii)  continuous  operation  and  maintenance  with  sustainable  financial  sources  based  on  a \nrealistic and enforceable tariff structure. Other general lessons reflected in the project design \nare (i) sludge management; (ii) effective cross-sector coordination; (iii) capacity development of \nthe executing, implementing, and relevant agencies; and (iv) establishment of an effective \nproject monitoring and evaluation system. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be an improved urban water environment, public health, \nand quality of life for urban residents in Huainan. The outcome will be improved management of \nsurface water resources in Huainan.  \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will have the following outputs:13 \n12.  Output 1: Improvement of wastewater collection. Output 1 will convert the existing \nCSS to SSS, and establish SSS in newly developed areas by installing new sanitary sewers. \nThe SSS will separate wastewater and storm water, and transfer the wastewater directly to \nexisting eastern and western WWTPs. Existing buildings and communities being served by CSS \nwill be disconnected from combined sewers and reconnected to the newly installed sanitary \nsewers.14 Along and in the urban water channels, intercepting sewers and wells will be installed \nto transfer wastewater through the SSS to the WWTPs. Under output 1, (i) approximately 192 \nkm of new sewers will be installed, including sanitary sewers, intercepting sewers, and pipes \nconnecting communities to the sanitary sewers;15 (ii) 10 intercepting wells will be constructed in \nsix urban water channels; and (iii) three wastewater pump stations will be constructed.16 \n \n                                                \n12 The official guidelines for the new government development plan, including an urbanization program, are expected \nto be disclosed in 2013. \n13 Output 1 will improve water quality in urban water channels and lakes by reducing wastewater inflow into them. \nOutputs 2 and 3 will improve water quality and environment in and around the channels and lakes by removing \nsludge, sediment, and solid waste; reducing garbage dumping; constructing wetlands, building revetments, and \nplanting vegetation in and along the lakes; and monitoring water quality and ecological impacts. The channels \nimproved and pump stations constructed or improved under output 2 will transmit storm water from the urban area \nto Gaotang Lake and Huai River, and reduce flood frequency from 1 in 5 years to 1 in 20 years.   \n14 After the conversion of CSS to SSS, combined sewers used for CSS will remain in operation; but only for transfer \nof storm water to urban water channels. \n15 For buildings and communities where property owners or developers having legal title can be identified, pipes \nconnecting the buildings and communities to the sanitary sewers will be installed by the property owners or \ndevelopers in accordance with the Urban Wastewater Discharge Permit Management Method issued by the \nMinistry of Construction (Order No. 152). For the other communities, pipes connecting the communities to the \nsanitary sewers will be installed under the project and financed under the ADB loan. \n16 Pursuant to the Agreement on the Expansion of Urban Wastewater Treatment Plant and its amendment made \nbetween HCWC and the HMG, acting through the Huainan Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Committee, in \n2012 and 2013, HCWC will expand the eastern WWTP from 100,000 m3/day to 150,000 m3/day by June 2015, and \nto 200,000 m3/day by 2019; and the western WWTP from 100,000 m3/day to 150,000 m3/day by 2018. These \nexpansions are out of the project scope, but the WWTPs are associated facilities of the project.  \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 2: Improvement of urban water channels and flood management.17 Output 2 \nwill rehabilitate or construct 5\u22129 km of six urban water channels to improve the urban water \nenvironment  and  improve  urban  flood  control  to  meet  1  in  20  year  storm  water  by  \n(i)  removing  sludge,  sediment,  and  solid  waste  from  the  existing  channels;  and \n(ii) reconstructing  or  constructing  the  waterways,  slopes,  and  embankments. 18  About \n10 maintenance  stations  will  be  constructed  along  the  channels  to  store  maintenance \nequipment and provide workstations for maintenance staff. To protect the project area from 1 in \n20 year storm water, the flood control capacity of the existing three pump stations will be \nincreased and four new pump stations constructed along Gaotang Lake. To protect the area \nalong Gaotang Lake from 1 in 50 year flood from the lake, about 14.5 km of embankment will be \nconstructed. \n14.  To  improve  urban  flood  management  in  Huainan,  an  urban  flood  forecasting  and \nwarning  system  will  be  procured.  An  associated  TA  will  prepare  an  urban  flood  and \nwaterlogging management master plan, including arrangements of the flood forecasting and \nwarning system; and develop the capacity of HMG staff for flood management, particularly for \nflood  forecasting  and  warning.  To  maintain  the  urban  water  channels  and  improve  flood \nmanagement in Huainan, (i) sampling and monitoring equipment for the urban water channels \nwill be procured; and (ii) consultants will be engaged to (a) pilot community environmental \nsupervision and flood management teams; (b) prepare a water quality and ecological monitoring \nplan for the urban water channels, and develop the capacity of HMG staff for monitoring; and (c) \nprepare an urban water channel maintenance program, and develop the capacity of HMG staff \nfor maintenance. Each team will comprise three community members, including at least a \nfemale member. A total of eight community environmental supervision and flood management \nteams will be established in model communities that are seriously affected by pollution and \nfloods from the urban water channels. The teams will (i) raise the environmental awareness of \ncommunity  residents  to  eliminate  waste  dumping  into  the  urban  water  channels;  and  (ii) \ndisseminate the flood warning system to community residents. \n15.  Output 3: Improvement of urban lakes. To improve water quality and reduce pollution \nload,  artificial  wetlands  will  be  constructed  at  major  discharge  points  into  the  five  lakes. \nRevetment will be constructed for Dajiangou Wetlands, Long Lake, and Shijian Lake to prevent \nsoil erosion and capture nonpoint source pollution from around the lakes. At Gaotang Lake, \nrevegetation will be piloted in the area between the embankment constructed under output 2 \nand the lake. The northern pond area of Long Lake will be dredged to remove sludge and \nsediment, including pollutants; and increase the storage capacity of the pond (footnote 18). \n16.  To  sustain  urban  lake management, (i) sampling  and  monitoring  equipment  will  be \nprocured to monitor the lake water quality; and (ii) the consultants engaged under output 2 will \n(a)  design  the  wetlands,  select  native  plant  species  for  the  wetlands,  and  guide  the \nmanagement of artificial wetlands; (b) assist in piloting a revegetation scheme at Gaotang Lake, \nand  develop  HMG  staff  capacity  for  revegetation  around  Gaotang  Lake  after  the  project;  \n(c)  prepare  lake  zoning  plans  for  Caoling  Lake,  Dajianguo  Wetlands,  and  Long  Lake  to \nsafeguard the natural and biodiversity values of the lakes; and (d) prepare integrated lake \nmanagement plans for Gaotang Lake and Shijian Lake. \n \n \n                                                \n17 For this project, \u201cflood\u201d includes waterlogging. \n18 Disposal of the dredged sludge and sediment was assessed as part of the environmental impact assessment \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n17.  Output 4: Project management and capacity development. A project management \noffice (PMO) and implementing agencies will (i) monitor and evaluate project impact, outcome, \nand  outputs  using  the  project  performance  management  system  prepared  during  project \npreparation; (ii) report project progress and key findings of monitoring through quarterly project \nprogress reports to ADB; and (iii) submit a project completion report within 6 months after \nproject physical completion. The project will provide the HMG and implementing agencies with \nproject management consultants and office equipment. During project implementation, various \ntraining sessions, workshops, and domestic and international study tours will be conducted. The \nproject management consultants will assist the PMO in conducting these capacity development \nactivities. \n18.  Special  features.  The  project  includes  innovative  structural  measures  such  as \nconstruction of artificial wetlands in the lakes to remove pollutants. The project complements the \nstructural measures with various nonstructural measures, including strengthening HMG capacity \nfor flood management, wastewater collection and treatment planning, and maintenance of the \nimproved urban water channels. The introduction of such international best practices for urban \nwater channel and lake pollution control and management, and flood management is ADB\u2019s \nvalue addition. In addition, extensive environmental due diligence included an assessment of \npotential  climate  change  impacts  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  capacity  of  flood  control \nstructures19 based  on  climate  change  modeling.20 As  a  result,  climate  change  adaptation \nmeasures are included in the project and TA for strengthening urban flood management in \nHuainan  (para.  23).21 The  use  of  sensitivity  analysis  to  examine  potential  climate  change \nimpacts  and  risks  of  flood  control  structures  is  a  replicable  best  practice  that  the  PRC \ngovernment can apply to future projects. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $343.33 million (Table 1). \n20.  The government has requested a loan of $150 million,22 including taxes and duties,23 \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including a grace period of 5 years; annuity repayment method with 10% discount factor; \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (the interest and other \ncharges during construction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on these, the average loan maturity is \n18.31 years; and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per annum.  \n21.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB loan will finance 43.7% of the project cost \n(base cost, including taxes and duties). The HMG will finance 56.3% (base cost, including taxes \nand duties; costs for land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection; and physical \n                                                \n19 Climate Change Impact (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Xiaotao Cheng, Jing Wang, et al. 2008.

The PRC will be the borrower of the loan and will make the entire \nproceeds  available  to  the  Anhui  provincial  government,  and  then  to  the  HMG.  The  loan \nproceeds made available to the Anhui provincial government and the HMG will carry the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The HMG will assume the foreign exchange and \ninterest rate variation risks on the ADB loan.  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Retroactive financing of up to $30.0 million, 20% of \nthe ADB loan, is possible for expenditures before loan effectiveness but not more than \n12 months before the signing of the loan agreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed by \nthe PRC government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HMG = Huainan municipal government. \nSource: ADB. \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n23.  The  HMG  has  requested  policy  and  advisory  TA  for  Strengthening  Urban  Flood \nManagement in Huainan Municipality. The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $500,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund25 under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The HMG will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  office  accommodation,  domestic  transportation,  remuneration  and  per  diem  for \ncounterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind contributions. The TA  will  prepare  an  urban flood  and \nwaterlogging management master plan for the municipality and develop a flood forecasting and \nwarning system. The HMG will be the executing agency. The leading group established for the \nproject will provide overall guidance for TA implementation. The PMO established for the project \nwill administer day-to-day TA activities. The TA will be implemented from April 2014 to March \n2016. ADB will engage the consultants following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). International (13.5 person-months) and national (14.5 person-\nmonths) consultants will be recruited through quality- and cost-based selection at a quality\u2013cost \nweighting ratio of 80:20. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.8%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of \nCNY458.8 million.  The  rates  of  return  for  the  individual  outputs  are  13.2%  for  improved \nwastewater collection, 16.8% for improved urban water environment and flood management, \nand 12.2% for improved urban lake environment. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is \ngenerally robust to potential variations in costs and benefits. The project remains economically \n                                                \n25  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "8 \nviable even with a combination of a benefit decline of 10.0% and a capital cost increase of \n10.0%. In addition, the actual economic benefits are likely larger than estimated as some \nsignificant types of benefits are not quantifiable due to limited data. \n25.  The financial sustainability assessment for the nonrevenue suboutputs indicates that the \nHMG has sufficient funds to finance the counterpart contributions, as well as to finance debt \nservice and operation and maintenance costs during operation. Average annual counterpart \nfunding accounts for 1.05% of the projected HMG revenues during implementation. Annual debt \nservice ranges from 0.12% of projected revenues in 2019 to 0.25% in 2024. Annual funds \nrequired for facility operation and maintenance averages around 0.27% of projected revenues \nand 0.56% of projected expenditures during 2019\u20132024. The financial analysis for output 1 \nconfirms that it is financially feasible, with a financial internal rate of return of 3.55% compared \nwith the weighted average cost of capital of 2.47%; the financial net present value is estimated \nto be CNY50.92 million. The financial viability is generally robust but is sensitive to revenue \ndeclines. While the HMG will provide subsidies to cover expenses when needed, strengthening \nthe financial sustainability of wastewater collection facilities through gradual increases in the \nwastewater collection tariff to full-cost recovery will be important. \nB.  Governance \n26.  An assessment of HMG\u2019s procurement capacity, including the PMO, confirms that it, \nacting through a procurement agency and with the assistance of ADB and the consultants, \nwould have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate full compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Specific policy requirements, capacity development, and \nother supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  HMG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 24). \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The  project  will  reduce  flood  risk  and  improve  the  urban  water  environment  for  a \npopulation of 962,000 (39.2% of the total population of Huainan), including 65,000 poor people. \nSuch improvements could also benefit the water environment, public health, and quality of life \nfor urban residents in Huainan, thus helping to reduce poverty. The project will create 5,000 \ntemporary  jobs  during  implementation  and  120  permanent  jobs  during  operation  and \nmaintenance. \n29.  The project was designed as effective gender mainstreaming. Women\u2019s focus group \ndiscussions found that environmental improvements are anticipated to have a significant gender \nimpact, with reduced time burdens and costs for health care, preparation for floods, and clean-\nup after floods; and with overall improvement of living conditions and the environment. The \ngender action plan contains activities to ensure project benefits are accrued by women at least \nas equally as by men, including (i) women\u2019s participation in discussions on detailed designs, \nprice hearings, community activities, training, and project management; (ii) job offerings to \nwomen; and (iii) inclusion of gender perspectives in capacity development of HMG staff. 26 \n                                                \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will acquire a total of 126 hectares \nof land; 248 hectares will be occupied temporarily. The project will demolish 17,257 square \nmeters of housing and 780 square meters of small business shops. It will affect 2,075 people, \n1,451 of these will lose more than 10% of their productive assets and/or be physically displaced. \nThe  HMG,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  engaged  under  the  project  preparatory  TA, \nprepared a resettlement plan in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and related \nlaws and regulations of Huainan Municipality, Anhui Province, and the PRC. The HMG has \nendorsed the resettlement plan and disclosed the relevant information to affected people. The \nresettlement plan was also disclosed on ADB website. The HMG will fully finance CNY292.1 \nmillion of land acquisition and resettlement costs. The ADB loan will finance the costs for \nsemiannual  external  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  HMG  has  experience  in \nconducting land acquisition and resettlement for foreign-funded projects and has the capacity to \nimplement the resettlement plan for this project. \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Indigenous peoples will not be affected or benefit \nfrom the project. \n32.  Environment (category A). The environmental impact assessment report prepared for \nthe project is based on the domestic environmental impact assessment report,27 as well as the \nconsultant\u2019s report on the project preparatory TA; and complies with the PRC\u2019s environmental \npolicy and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It concludes that the project will have substantial \npositive environmental and socioeconomic benefits resulting from (i)  improved urban water \nchannels, lakes, and Huai River; (ii) improved management of water and ecology in the lakes; \nand  (iii) improved  flood  management.  Environmental  concerns  of  the  project  include \nconstruction impacts on air, noise, and water quality; solid waste; and disturbance to some \nwater  birds.  These  will  be  prevented  or  minimized  to  acceptable  levels  through  the \nimplementation of an environmental management plan with adequate mitigation and monitoring \narrangements. The plan includes a detailed training program to ensure the HMG has adequate \ncapacity to manage and monitor environmental impacts and risks. The environmental impact \nassessment report was disclosed on ADB website on 28 May 2013. \n33.  Grievance redress mechanism. The PMO will set up a grievance redress mechanism \nto address social and environmental concerns of stakeholders. The procedures are described in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 24). \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe WWTPs existing in the  Pursuant to an agreement and its amendment made between HCWC and the HMG, \nproject area do not have  acting through the Huainan Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Committee, in \nadequate capacity to treat  2012 and 2013 HCWC will increase the capacity of the eastern WWTP from  \nan increased volume of  100,000 m3/day to 150,000 m3/day by June 2015 and to 200,000 m3/day by 2019,  \nwastewater.  and the western WWTP from 100,000 m3/day to 150,000 m3/day by 2018. \n                                                \n27 An accredited local environmental research institute prepared a domestic environmental impact assessment report \nin line with related laws, regulations, and standards of the PRC.  \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nBuildings and communities  For buildings and communities where property owners or developers having legal title \nare not reconnected from  can be identified, pipes connecting the buildings and communities to the sanitary \nthe existing combined  sewers will be installed by the property owners or developers in accordance with a \nsewers to the new sanitary  regulation issued by the Ministry of Construction.
