The emergency assistance is \nstructured  to  provided  immediate  and  flexible  financing  for  disaster-related  recovery  and \nrehabilitation expenditures. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LOAN \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nIndonesia is in one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone regions. The country is exposed to \na  range  of  natural  hazards,  including  flooding,  earthquakes,  landslides,  tsunamis,  volcanic \neruptions, and recently liquefaction.1 Since 1990, Indonesia has experienced an average of 289 \nsignificant  disasters  per  year  and  an  average  annual  death  toll  of  about  8,000.2  The  direct \neconomic  cost  of  disasters  is  about  Rp22.9  trillion  annually  ($1.8  billion).3  The  severity  and \nfrequency of these disasters stretch national and local government capacity to respond. \n \n4. \nOn 28 September 2018, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck Central Sulawesi province, \ntriggering cascading catastrophic events. The earthquake led to a near-field tsunami that struck \nthe  coast  of  Central  Sulawesi.4  The  earthquake  and  tsunami  triggered  landslides  and  caused \nliquefaction of soil in several densely populated  districts, reportedly burying entire villages and \ncomplicating relief and recovery efforts. The disasters in Central Sulawesi were preceded by a \ndevastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province in August 2018. \n \n5. \nDamage  reports  from  the  National  Disaster  Management  Agency  (BNPB)  on  Central \nSulawesi  and  West  Nusa  Tenggara  identify  severe  damage  to  property,  infrastructure,  and \nlivelihoods.  Figure  1  summarizes key  indicators for the  two  disasters.  More than  2,600  people \nhave  been  confirmed  dead,  680  people  are  still  missing,  and  more  than  650,000  people  have \nbeen displaced. Houses, schools, and health care centers have suffered extensive damage. The \nmovement of people and goods is hampered by damage to hundreds of kilometers of roads, and \nlivelihoods have been hit particularly hard. Field reports suggest that about 29 of the 36-kilometer \nGumbasa  irrigation  system  in  Central  Sulawesi  have  been  completely  destroyed.  The  coastal \nareas were battered by the tsunami, destroying fishing vessels, ports, and warehouse and cold \nchain  facilities.  The  risk  of  liquefaction  has  rendered  much  of  Palu  City  unusable,  forcing \ngovernment to explore significant relocation of the city to a new site. BNPB\u2019s initial assessment \nindicated damage and losses of Rp13.8 trillion ($950 million) for Central Sulawesi and Rp18.2 \n\n                                                 \n1  Liquefaction is a process in which sand and silt that is saturated with water loses strength and acts as a fluid when \n\nshaken by an earthquake (United States Geological Survey. What is Liquefaction?). \n\n2  Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. \n3  Government  of  Indonesia,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2018.

Of this amount, \nabout Rp24.2 trillion is damage and Rp7.8 trillion is losses.5 \n \n6. \nThe human cost of disasters is particularly acute for women and girls, who are especially \nvulnerable. While the disasters have harmed large segments of the population, experience from \nother  disasters  shows  that  women  and  girls  are  likely  to  be  disproportionately  affected  given \npreexisting gender inequality and discrimination. Women\u2019s chances of survival in disasters are \nreduced by trying to protect the children, elderly, and infirm in their care.6 With displacement and \nthe absence of adequate shelter, women and adolescent girls experience limited privacy and are \nhighly vulnerable to sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence. \n \n\nFigure 1: Disasters, Damage, and Losses \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  economic  cost  to  both  provinces  will  rise  when  losses  in  output  and  household \n7. \nincomes  are  included.  Growth  in  Central  Sulawesi  had  accelerated  past  the  national  average \nsince 2015 and was expected to reach about 7% in 2018 before the disaster. The consequences \nof the disaster will be most acute for agriculture, fisheries, mining, and quarrying, which jointly \naccount for more than 50% of the province\u2019s economy. While the full economic cost of the disaster \nis difficult to project, initial estimates suggest gross regional domestic product growth will fall to \n3.6% in 2018\u2014cutting growth by half\u2014with the economy recovering to pre-disaster levels only by \n                                                 \n5  S.P.

Capital stock is further expected to contract by 7.0% over the same period.7 In West Nusa \nTenggara,  weakening  export  performance  slowed  growth  to  0.1%  in  2017.  The  effects  of  the \nAugust earthquake are estimated to cut the gross regional domestic product growth rate by 1.6 \npercentage points, with the local economy expected to contract and recover to pre-disaster levels \nonly after 2022. Capital stock is expected to contract by 3.1% in the province. Figure 2 presents \nselected indicators on the impact of the disasters. Initial estimates suggest the potential impact \non the national growth rate to be as high as 0.1% of gross domestic product for 2019, representing \nforgone output of Rp16.2 trillion ($1.1 billion). \n \n\nFigure 2: Potential Impact on Regional Economic Growth and Poverty Rates \n(annual change) \n\nt\n\nh\nw\no\nr\ng\n \nP\nD\nR\nG\n\n15%\n\n10%\n\n5%\n\n0%\n\n-5%\n\npre-disaster projected\n(Central Sulawesi)\n\npre-disaster projected\n(West Nusa Tenggara)\n\n18%\n\n16%\n\n14%\n\n12%\n\nl\n\ne\np\no\ne\np\n\n \nr\no\no\np\n\n \nf\no\n \ne\ng\na\nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018s\n\n2019s\n\nCentral Sulawesi\n\nWest Nusa Tenggara\n\nCentral Sulawesi\n\nWest Nusa Tenggara\n\nGRDP = gross regional domestic product. s = simulation. \nSource: Statistics Indonesia; and ADB estimates based on IndoTERM (regional economic model). \n \n8. \nThe trend of falling poverty incidence in the affected provinces will be reversed. Compared \nwith the national average of 9.8%, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates the share of \npeople below the poverty line is 14.0% in Central Sulawesi and 14.8% in West Nusa Tenggara. \nProvincial averages mask significant disparities, with poverty incidence as high as 32% in North \nLombok.  The  pre-disaster  poverty  gap,  which  measures  how  far  an  individual  falls  below  the \npoverty line, is also substantially higher in both provinces than the national average, driven in part \nby the large share of the population that resides in rural areas in Central Sulawesi and high urban \npoverty in West Nusa Tenggara. This large gap suggests that the poor are likely to be pushed \ndeeper into poverty, are more vulnerable to ongoing risks, and will take longer to recover from the \nevents.  Initial  ADB  estimates  suggest  that  poverty  incidence  will  increase  to  16.4%  in  Central \nSulawesi and 16.8% in West Nusa Tenggara in 2018.8 \n \n9. \nJob  prospects  will  be  significantly  reduced  by  the  disasters.  Most  people  in  Central \nSulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara rely on agriculture or services in the informal sector to support \ntheir livelihood.9 More than two-thirds of employment is informal, and limited social assistance is \navailable for the jobless adult population. Women\u2019s participation in the labor force is higher than \nthe  national  average,  but  one  in  three  is  an  unpaid  worker.  Growth  in  average  wages  has \nstagnated since 2013, and a considerable gender wage gap exists. Given these conditions, the \n\n                                                 \n7  Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n8  Poverty Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Statistics Indonesia. 2018. Labor Force Situation in Indonesia: February 2018. Jakarta. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n\feffects of the disasters have been particularly damaging to livelihoods. In Central Sulawesi, jobs \nin agriculture, fisheries, and mining have been immediately reduced, driving more workers into \nthe  informal  economy.  Primary  irrigation  channels  have  been  damaged,  with  immediate \nconsequences  for  farmers.  Wide  stretches  of  coastline  have  been  rendered  unusable  for \naquaculture, and marine life will be slow to recover. Damage to maritime ports in Central Sulawesi \nwill constrain trade. In Lombok, the impact of the earthquakes on tourism has had major adverse \neffects on both formally and informally employed people in the sector. \n \nFiscal  adjustments  will  be  required  nationally  and  locally  to  meet  the  disaster  recovery \n10. \nneeds. The economic and social costs of the recent disasters, estimated to exceed Rp40.0 trillion \n($2.8  billion),  place  significant  additional  fiscal  pressure  on  the  Government  of  Indonesia.  The \nnational government has mobilized immediate resources to aid in the relief and rescue efforts. \nInitial  cost  estimates  from  Ministry  of  Finance  suggest  an  additional  Rp4.0  trillion  of  spending \nbeyond  the  initially  budgeted  resources  of  Rp4.0 trillion  for  2018  and  2019.  The  National \nDevelopment  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  is  coordinating  the  development  of  short-  and \nmedium-term  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  plans  for  Central  Sulawesi  and  Lombok.  Initial \nestimates  from  BAPPENAS  suggest  a  cost  of  Rp22.0  trillion  for  Central  Sulawesi  and  Rp12.0 \ntrillion  for  Lombok.  Furthermore,  key  agencies,  including  the  ministries  of  public  works  and \nhousing,  education  and  culture,  and  transport  have  been  instructed  by  the  government  to \nreallocate existing allocations under the 2018 budget to provide priority support for affected areas, \nwith  preliminary  estimates  of  Rp1.7  trillion.  Without  additional  financing  resources,  these \nreallocations  will  reduce  planned  government  investment  and  services  in  other  parts  of  the \ncountry as funds are diverted to meet emergency needs. \n \nThe  additional  financing  needs  have  occurred  as  Indonesia  faces  significant  economic \n11. \nuncertainties and surging financing costs. Support from ADB and other development partners will \nbe critical to help the government meet the costs of the recovery and rehabilitation efforts and to \nensure  that  essential  development  spending  on  health,  education,  and  social  protection  is \nmaintained.

Presentation on Recovery Efforts, 23 October 2018. Jakarta. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fThe  government  has  responded  strongly  to  the  disasters.  Following  the  earthquake  in \n12. \nCentral Sulawesi, the governor announced an initial 14-day state of emergency for the province \non 29 September 2018, which was subsequently extended by another 14 days as a more serious \npicture of the damage emerged.10 Coordinated by BNPB, about 11,000 government personnel \nwere  deployed  to  the  affected  areas  to  provide  immediate  rescue,  evacuation,  and  relief \noperations.  BAPPENAS  is  leading  the  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  for  Rehabilitation  and \nReconstruction  (Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan)  in  coordination  with  key  agencies  such  as  the \nministries of public works and housing, agrarian affairs and spatial planning, social affairs, and \nenergy  and  mineral  resources.  Because  of  the  complexities  caused  by  liquefaction,  the \ngovernment plans to prepare the Central Sulawesi Action Plan in phases\u2014the plan for recovery \nand rehabilitation will be finalized by the end of 2018 and the reconstruction plan will be finalized \nby  March  2019.  The  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  plan  for  West  Nusa  Tenggara  Barat \n(Lombok Action Plan) has been finalized. Both action plans are based on robust understanding \nof  the  damage  assessment  and  disaster  risk,  including  gender-differentiated  impacts  of  the \ndisaster and recovery needs. The plans include sections on (i) urban development, housing, and \nsettlement;  (ii)  infrastructure  reconstruction;  (iii)  social  protection;  (iv)  economic  recovery;  and  \n(v)  cross-sector  programming.  The  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  also  covers  financing \npartnerships and institutional and regulatory development. \n \n13. \nThe  national  and  local  governments  are  providing  leadership  to  ensure  the  effective \ncoordination  of  development  partners.  Humanitarian  partners  have  been  coordinating  their \nresponse  and  recovery  efforts.  Effective  coordination  for  emergency  response  is  managed \nthrough the establishment of eight clusters, each led by a line agency and a member from the \nHumanitarian Country Team. An early recovery coordination cluster led by BNPB and the United \nNations  Development  Programme  is  working  together  with  local  government  to  identify  local \nrecovery needs. Development partners, including ADB, the European Union, Japan International \nCooperation Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank, have \ncollectively offered support to the government in the assessment process. \n \n14. \nIn  consultation  with  the  government,  ADB  has  put  together  a  comprehensive  support \npackage  for  the  disasters,  including  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  and  three  channels  of \nfinancing support. On 8 October 2018, ADB approved an emergency grant of $3 million from the \nAsia Pacific Disaster Response Fund.11 The grant will support BNPB with immediate relief works \nin Central Sulawesi in compliance with the implementation guidelines of the fund. TA grants of up \nto  $3  million  from  various  resources  have  also  been  identified  and  set  aside  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s  post-disaster  needs  assessment  and  preparation  of  an  action  plan  and  sector-\nspecific  projects  for  reconstruction  (para.  17).  In  addition  to  providing  grant  support,  ADB  has \nworked with the government to identify three potential channels for financial support. First, the \nEmergency  Assistance for  Recovery  and  Rehabilitation for  Recent  Disasters  loan  will  help  the \nnational and local governments meet the near-term requirements in dealing with the aftermath of \nthe disaster, while ensuring that other critical social and development priorities are met. Second, \nADB is preparing an emergency assistance project loan to support reconstruction and relocation \nof  critical  infrastructure,  including  public  facilities  in  affected  areas.  Third,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment are considering reprogramming of existing loans to support reconstruction efforts. \n \n15. \nSeveral  factors  were  considered  when  determining  the  appropriate  modality  for  the \nemergency assistance (Figure 3). The EAL is a quick-disbursing loan to support the government\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n10 Governor  of  Central  Sulawesi.  2018.

Initial recovery and rehabilitation efforts are likely to be spread across many \nactivities  requiring  smaller  amounts,  rather  than  a  small  number  of  investments  with  large \namounts. As such, providing support that works through the government\u2019s budget system, rather \nthan  directly  financing  individual  activities,  will  be  a  more  efficient  and  effective  response \nmechanism. The loan is aligned with the six characteristics of an EAL as it (i) helps rebuild high-\npriority  physical  assets  and  restore  economic,  social,  and  governance  activities  after \nemergencies;  (ii)  is  designed  to  mitigate  immediate  losses  to  priority  assets,  capacity,  or \nproductivity rather than to provide relief or comprehensive reconstruction; (iii) provides immediate \nshort-term  transitional  assistance;  (iv)  is  restricted  to  the  transition  phase  and  exclusively  for \npriority  rehabilitation;  (v)  is  linked  with  and  complements  humanitarian  relief  efforts  by  other \ndevelopment  partners  to  ease  the  transition  from  relief  to  normal  development;  and  (vi)  may \ninclude quick-disbursing components, but is not a policy-based loan.12 \n \n\nFigure 3: Factors Supporting ADB Response Modality \n\n \n\nEmergency (cause) \n\n(i)  earthquake, tsunami, \n\nliquefaction \n\n(ii) IDPs \n(iii) unemployment \n(iv) social assistance \n\n \n \nEAR3D (recovery \n \nand rehabilitation + \n \nEmergency \nAssistance Project \n \n(reconstruction) + \ngrant and/or TA \n\nFiscal and financial pressure \n(effect) \n(i)  economic shock  \n(ii) fiscal pressure from \n\nrecovery and \nreconstruction spending \n\neroded \n\n(iii) spending and \n\n(v) damaged infrastructure \n\ninvestment diverted from \nother key areas \n\n \n \n \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EAR3D = Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent \nDisasters, IDP = internally displaced person, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n16. \nThe  EAL  builds  on  lessons  from  past  emergency  assistance,  including  the  following:  \n(i) providing immediate financing is essential to ensure timely rehabilitation and recovery, thereby \nreducing  the  overall  social  and  economic  impacts  of  a  disaster;  (ii)  coursing  the  financial \nassistance  through  the  government\u2019s  budget  helps  build  ownership  of  the  rehabilitation  and \nrecovery  process;  (iii)  developing  a  comprehensive  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  is \ncrucial for the effective implementation of the post-disaster response; (iv) providing TA to develop \nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction plans helps ensure potential implementation challenges are \nidentified early on; and (v) providing TA that helps the government integrate building back better \nand resilience principles ensures that the EAL contributes to the objectives and priorities of ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2016\u20132019  for  Indonesia.13  The  EAL  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030,  particularly  the  operational  priorities  on  poverty  reduction, gender  equality,  and \ndisaster resilience.14 \n \n17. \nADB  has  mobilized  TA  resources  to  support  the  government\u2019s  response  planning. \nPlanning  and  preparation  of  the  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  will  be  supported  under  the \n\n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004.

The TA will help build capacity within the central and local governments, as \nwell as provide additional dedicated resources to support the effective delivery and monitoring of \nrecovery and rehabilitation activities. The new TA will focus on three key areas: (i) developing and \nimplementing  rigorous  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  coordination  within  and  across \ngovernment agencies; (ii) building capacity for effective financial management, and tracking and \nreporting on disaster recovery and rehabilitation expenditures in line with the action plans; and \n(iii)  ensuring  that  rehabilitation  activities  are  implemented  considering  the  special  needs  of \nwomen, girls, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups, in line with government regulations. Where \nappropriate,  the  TA  will  use  civil  society  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  to \nprovide monitoring inputs.18 \n \nB. \n \nThe EAL is aligned with the following impact: socioeconomic impact of disaster reduced, \n19. \nin  line  with  the  national  medium-term  development  plan,  2015\u20132019.19  The  EAL  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: adverse social impact of the recent disasters on the poor mitigated.20 \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe  EAL  will  provide  $500  million  in  immediate  support  to  the  government  to  meet  its \nadditional  financing  requirements  linked  to  new  public  expenditure  under  the  action  plans  for \nCentral Sulawesi and Lombok. \n \n21. \nOutput 1: Funding of the national government expenditure program for 2019 met. \nThe EAL will provide immediate, flexible financing support for the government to efficiently and \neffectively respond to the disasters of 2018. The original projected net financing gap was Rp412.0 \ntrillion for 2018 and Rp88.0 trillion for 2019. However, this gap is expected to increase significantly \nbecause of the Rp40.0 trillion needed for the disasters Indonesia faced in 2018. At the same time, \nthe government is committed to protect the delivery of critical public services across the country. \n \n22. \nOutput  2:  Government  action  plans  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nimplemented. The government\u2019s  action  plans for  Central  Sulawesi  and Lombok  will  guide  the \nrecovery and rehabilitation efforts. Spanning a 2-year period after the disasters, the action plans \ncover  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  efforts  in  five  key  areas  (para.  12).  ADB\u2019s  emergency \nassistance will focus on immediate recovery and rehabilitation needs in three of these areas: (i) \nurban development, housing and shelter; (ii) social protection; and (iii) economic recovery. For \nthe Central Sulawesi Action Plan, the immediate loss and damage assessment period is October\u2013\nNovember  2018.

From  January  to  March  2019,  the \ngovernment  will  focus  on  early  rehabilitation,  emphasizing  temporary  housing,  resumption  of \nbasic  public  services  such  as  education,  cash  transfers  for  victims,  livelihood  assistance,  and \ntraining and skills development. During March 2019\u2013October 2020, the government will focus on \nreconstruction  and  relocation  to  the  new  Palu  City  site.  The  Lombok  Action  Plan  will  follow  a \nsimilar schedule. This output will cover the recovery and rehabilitation phases of the action plans. \nA gender perspective will be applied during implementation. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  government  has  requested  an  EAL  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help fund the financing gap for 2019 arising from additional public spending for the \n2018 disasters and the action plans.21 The EAL will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; a straight-line repayment method; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment fee of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years, and no maturity premium applies. \n \nE. \n \nThe  EAL  will  provide  immediate  mitigation  assistance  to  the  government.  It  will  enable \n24. \nquick-disbursing support to help ensure that vital recovery and rehabilitation expenditures are met \nwithout  compromising  other  economic  and  social  development  expenditures  in  the  national \nbudget. This reflects the urgent need to mitigate the immediate economic and social impacts of \nthe disasters. \n \n25. \nThe  support  will  flow  through  government  systems  to  enable  a  timely  response.  The \ngovernment faces a significant gap in its disaster financing plan (para. 21). The EAL will enable \nthe government to generate counterpart funds in rupiah equivalent to the loan proceeds. These \nfunds will be used to meet the essential public expenditures related to the disasters, in line with \nthe action plans. The EAL will not directly finance recovery activities. The Board is requested to \nwaive  the  requirement  under  the  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  for  such  quick-\ndisbursing components to finance only a list of identified imports necessary for effective recovery \nassistance.22  EAL  disbursement  and  related  arrangements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nprocedures  applicable  to  policy-based  lending,23  based  on  a  list  of  ineligible  items,24  following \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n26. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency. The proceeds of the EAL will \nbe disbursed upon effectiveness25 and the loan will close by December 2019. Implementation of \nthe emergency response outputs is expected to take 2 years and will be completed by December \n2020. \n \n\n                                                 \n21 Letter of the Minister of Finance of Indonesia to ADB dated 17 October 2018. \n22 Footnote 12, para. 111. \n23 ADB. 1998.

The \n27. \n2017 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment for Indonesia showed that 17 \nof the  31  indicators  scored  A  or  B,  which  are  both  considered  above  the  basic  alignment  with \ninternational  good  practice.26  Indicators  with  particularly  good  assessment  results  included \ntransparency  of  public  finance,  and  accounting  and  reporting\u2014all  key  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the action plans. The assessment also identified some areas for improvement, \nincluding  the  strategic  allocation  of  resources  and  the  efficiency  of  public  spending  by  linking \nperformance information more effectively to planning and budgeting. The established legal and \nregulatory  framework  for  public  financial  management  was  strengthened  in  2017  through  the \ngovernment regulations mandating coordination between the National Planning Agency and the \nMOF  to  improve  the  policy  orientation  of  budgeting.  Recent  reforms  to  public  procurement \nsystems  have  improved  the  efficiency,  competitiveness,  and  transparency  of  government \nprocurement. ADB supports the government\u2019s governance reform agenda through its Fiscal and \nPublic Expenditure Management Program and Stepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration \nProgram.27  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe EAL is anchored on the government\u2019s action plans for Central Sulawesi and Lombok. \nThe  government  has  allocated  an  additional  Rp2.5  trillion  for  BNPB  beyond  the  Rp4.0  trillion \ninitially planned in the 2018 budget. In the 2019 budget, the government has allocated Rp15.0 \ntrillion for disaster response. Disbursements of funds from the state treasury will be based on the \naction plans. Depending on the activity, funds will be made available for withdrawal to BNPB and \nrelevant  line  ministries  and  agencies.  Local  treasury  offices  will  undertake  necessary  internal \ncontrols in coordination with BNPB. The MOF will submit an annual consolidated statement of \nexpenditures under the action plans based on actual disbursements.28 \n \nThe government has strengthened its financial management and reporting arrangements \n29. \nrelating  to  disasters.  The  Audit  Board  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  conducts  annual  audits  of \nBNPB  and  concerned  line  ministries.  The  government  will  provide  BNPB\u2019s  annual  audited \nstatement  to  ADB.  Following  the  2004  tsunami  in  Aceh,  Indonesia  was  closely  involved  in \ndeveloping the international audit standards for disaster-related aid.29 The government intends to \nconduct a special audit of the expenditures for the recent disasters. The Corruption Eradication \nCommission will have oversight on all implementation activities. \n \n\nFinancial Reporting, Auditing, and Monitoring \n\n                                                 \n26 World  Bank.  2018.

Poverty incidence is \nexpected to surge as a result of the economic and social costs of the disasters\u2014from 14.0% to \n16.4% in Central Sulawesi and from 14.8% to 16.8% in Lombok in 2018 (para. 8). The growth of \nregional economies is also expected to slow by 3.6 percentage points in Central Sulawesi and \n1.6% percentage points in Lombok in 2018 (para. 7). The EAL supports priority interventions to \nhelp mitigate these adverse impacts on affected communities. \n \n31. \nThe  EAL  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  at  entry. It  aims to  ensure that  a \ngender  perspective  is  integrated  in  the  government\u2019s  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  for \nRehabilitation  and  Reconstruction30  in  line  with  the  2014  BNPB  regulation  on  Gender \nMainstreaming  in  Disaster  Management,  which  mandates  gender-responsive  planning  and \nbudgeting during the emergency phase and the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. The EAL \nalso  seeks  to  ensure  sufficient  resources  are  allocated  to  implement  gender-specific  recovery \ninterventions. The following measures will be implemented to achieve these objectives: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nConsultations  to  prepare  the  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  will  include  gender \nstakeholders such as women\u2019s organizations. \nThe  most  appropriate  disbursement  modality  of  cash  grants  and  benefits  for \nhouseholds will be done in close consultation and agreement with women and men \nin affected communities. \nThe  action  plan  will  take  into  account  findings  of  rapid  gender  assessment(s) \nconducted  after  the  disaster  and  will  integrate  specific  interventions  to  address \nmajor gender issues.31 \nThe action plan will address the needs of women and girls in terms of sanitation \nand  hygiene,  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  gender-based  violence,  and \nrestoration and improvement of livelihoods.  \nThe action plan will include adequate measures and strategies to strengthen the \npreparedness and resilience of communities to climate change and disasters, and \nwill ensure an active role and voice for women in disaster risk reduction initiatives. \nGender focal points will be established in local offices of the Disaster Management \nAgency  in  both  disaster  areas,  as  mandated  by  the  Gender  Mainstreaming  in \nDisaster Management regulation. \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n32. \nGender expertise will be mobilized with TA resources to support this process and build the \ncapacity  of  the  local  gender  focal  point  system  (paras.  17  and  18).  The  TA  will  also  support \ninclusive  monitoring  of  the  action  plan  implementation  involving  civil  society  organizations, \nincluding women\u2019s groups and other vulnerable groups. \n \nD. \n \n33. \nThe EAL supports the government\u2019s fiscal response by providing quick-disbursing funds \nthrough  the  government\u2019s  budget  system.  Because  the  loan  proceeds  are  not  earmarked  for \nspecific spending or investments, the EAL does not trigger the safeguard policies and is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. However, the \n                                                 \n30 Emphasis  is  placed  on  the  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan,  which  is  still  being  developed  with  ADB  support.  The \ncompleted Action Plan for Lombok emphasizes ensuring gender perspectives are applied during implementation, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. \n\n31 The  CARE  Rapid  Gender  Analysis  is  an example  of such an  assessment  (CARE  Indonesia.  2018.  CARE  Rapid \n\nGender Analysis: Sulawesi Earthquake and Tsunami Indonesia\u2014Version 2. Jakarta). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nEAL  will  apply  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  to  track  government-funded  recovery \nactivities, with indicators tracked in the design and monitoring framework (paras. 28 and 29). \n \nE. \n \n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  2  and  described  in \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWorsening conditions in \ninternational financial \nmarkets put further \npressures on the economy, \ndrawing spending away from \nrecovery efforts. \n\nAdditional disasters and their \nimpact on other regional \neconomies may undermine \nimplementation of the action \nplans. \n\nCoordination across \ngovernment agencies and \ndevelopment partners is \nweak. \n\nThe early stage of \npreparation for the action \nplans poses challenges for \nstrong financial management \nmeasures, including \nidentification of eligible \nexpenditures, monitoring, \nand external audit provision. \n\nMitigation Measures \nBank Indonesia has raised the policy rate five times in 2018, totaling 150 \nbasis points, signaling strong commitment to macroeconomic stability. \nFiscal policy further reinforces the government\u2019s commitment to stability. \nPrior to the disasters, the budget deficit was projected to decline from \n2018 to 2019. Appropriate policy responses combined with strong \nmacroeconomic fundamentals and a sound financial system help reduce \nrisks from external shocks. \nThe government has introduced a new disaster risk financing strategy to \nimprove financial preparedness for disaster response. Near-term priorities \ninclude implementation of a pilot scheme for state asset insurance; \nstrengthening the current schemes for agriculture and fisheries insurance; \nand building awareness of key line agencies, subnational governments, \nand Parliament. \nThe government has taken the lead in coordinating across concerned \nagencies and with development partners. BNPB is taking the lead in \ncoordinating all humanitarian and relief efforts and coordinating damage \nand loss assessments. BAPPENAS is leading the formulation of the \nrecovery and reconstruction plans in close coordination with all key \nagencies and development partners. BNPB will coordinate the \nimplementation of the action plans. ADB is coordinating closely with \ndevelopment partners, including JICA, UNDP, and the World Bank. \nThe MOF\u2019s SPAN manages all financial transaction data of the central \ngovernment in a full cycle from budget appropriations, allotment, and/or \nexecution to the production of financial statements. Budget allotment and \nexecution for rehabilitation and recovery will be based on the approved \ndisaster response action plans. The MOF will produce a consolidated \nannual financial report on expenditure related to recovery and \nrehabilitation in Central Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara.
