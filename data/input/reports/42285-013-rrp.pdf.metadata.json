It  responds  to  the  need  of  municipal  governments  for \nintegrated  urban  environmental  management  in  urban  areas  around  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  The \nproject  will  improve  urban  services  and  enhance  climate  change  resilience  in  Kampong \nimprovements; \nChhnang  and  Pursat  municipalities \ncommunity mobilization and environmental improvements; strengthened sector coordination and \noperations;  and  strengthened  capacity \nimplementation,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M).3 The project follows the Tonle Sap Urban Areas Development Framework \n(TSUADF) and Kampong Chhnang and Pursat urban development strategies to 2030.4 \n\nthrough  urban  area  environmental \n\nfor  project \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nUrbanization  in  Cambodia  is  taking  place  rapidly  since  2004  with  an  average  urban \ngrowth  rate  of  2.6%  per  year.  In  2013,  about  21.4%  of  Cambodia\u2019s  population  lived  in  urban \nareas.  Urban  areas  are  crucial  to  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  development  and  its  integration  into \nregional  markets  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  and  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, urbanization has been taking place with minimal \ncoordination and regulation, inadequate infrastructure and insufficient regard for environmental \nimpacts. This has resulted in unplanned growth, inefficient land use, damage and loss of natural \nresources,  and  inadequate  access  to  urban  services.  Problems  are  attributable  to  poor  urban \nmanagement, little strategic spatial planning, poor integration of environmental management in \nurban  planning,  and  insufficient  investment  in  infrastructure  and  community  services.  Urban \nplanning  and  investments  are  needed  to  accommodate  expanding  urban  populations,  sustain \neconomic growth in urban areas, and protect the environment. \n\n4. \nUrban areas  in the Tonle Sap  Basin  have a  direct  and  symbiotic relationship with  their \nrural  areas,  which  are  based  on  agriculture,  fisheries  and  manufacturing.  About  12%  of  the \npopulation in the Tonle Sap provinces live in urban areas along Highways No. 5 and 6, which \nencompass  the  Tonle  Sap  Lake;  the  six  largest  urban  areas  had  an  estimated  population  of \n480,000 in 2012 which is anticipated to grow to 670,000 by 2030.5 The Tonle Sap, a designated \nbiosphere  reserve  since  1997,  contributes  about  60%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  inland  fisheries \nproduction.  It  is  the  largest  freshwater  lake  in  Southeast  Asia  and  covers  250,000\u2013300,000 \nhectares (ha) in the dry season and 1.0 million\u20131.6 million ha in the wet season.  \n\n                                                \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) financed by the SCF. \n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   ADB  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Kingdom  of \nCambodia for Preparing the Integrated Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project.  Manila. \n(TA 7986-CAM, $700,000, approved on 13 December 2011). \n\n4   TSUADF  is  for  approval  by  the  government.  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  urban  development  strategies  were \n\napproved on 31 July 2014.  \n\n5  Includes municipalities of Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, Serei Saophoan, Siem Reap, Stueng Saen and Battambang. \n\nUrban growth figures are estimates based on national census and National Institute of Statistics projections. \n\n \n\n\fThe TSUADF guides sustainable growth and climate resilient infrastructure development \n5. \nof urban areas in the Tonle Sap Basin. The Tonle Sap is at risk of being adversely affected by \nclimate-induced changes to the Mekong River and its tributaries. About 62% of the Tonle Sap\u2019s \nwater originates in the Mekong River and 38% in the Tonle Sap basin. It absorbs about 20% of \nthe Mekong River\u2019s floodwaters. The Tonle Sap is connected to the Mekong River by the Tonle \nSap  River,  which reverses  its flow  seasonally.  As  a result  of climate  change  impacts,  average \nwater levels in the Tonle Sap may rise by 0.2 m and peak  water levels may increase by up to \n0.3  m  by  2050,  so  floods  may  last  9%  longer,  and  the  probability  of  river  floods  is  likely  to \nincrease. 6  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  ranked  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  and  creditworthiness  as  most \nvulnerable  to  the  effects  of  climate  change  amongst  the  116  nations  measured  as  part  of  a \nvulnerability  index. 7  The  TSUADF  prioritizes  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  municipalities \nbecause  of  their  strategic  importance,  climate  change  risk  and  environment  protection  needs, \nand  synergies  with  ADB  agriculture  and  rural  development  projects.  Increased  prosperity  and \ngreater  climate  resilient  infrastructure  will  strengthen  rural-urban  regional  linkages  in  these \ntowns through an integrated approach to urban environmental management.8 \n\nKampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  urban  development  strategies  list  severe  flooding  and \n6. \npoor  environmental  sanitation as key  infrastructure issues  affecting residents\u2019  health and well-\nbeing. Both municipalities experienced severe flooding in 2011 and suffer flooding 6\u20138 months \nof  a  year.  In  Kampong  Chhnang,  the  annual  hydrological  cycle  of  the  Tonle  Sap  is  the  main \ncause  of  flooding  and  inundation  damage. 9  In  Pursat,  lack  of  drainage  causes  the  most \ninundation  damage  and  affects  80%  of  the  town.  This  is  made  worse  by  climate-induced \nimpacts  and  limited  solid  waste  management  (SWM).  \u2018Reduce,  reuse,  recycle\u2019  for  waste \nmanagement  is  active  in  both  municipalities  through  junk  shops  and  waste  pickers,  but  only \nabout 20% of the waste stream in Kampong Chhnang and 30% in Pursat is recycled.  \n\n7. \nDuring the flooding season, poor and vulnerable communities are cut-off from the town \ncenter,  restricting  their  access  to  markets  and  social  services.  They  reside  in  low-lying  areas \nnear  the  Tonle  Sap  with  poor  drainage,  and  have  limited  access  to  SWM  services  and \nsanitation,  making  human  waste  disposal  an  environmental  issue  especially  for  communities \nliving  on,  and  adjacent  to,  the  Tonle  Sap.  About  61%  of  households  in  Pursat  and  50%  in \nKampong Chhnang have access to latrines. The Identification of Poor Households Programme \n(IDPoor) identified 2,133 poor households in Kampong Chhnang and 3,456 poor households in \nPursat project area.10 The project will use this program in supporting community initiatives.  \n\n8. \nMultiple  agencies  at  the  central  government  level  are  involved  in  urban  development \nand  environmental  protection:  the  Ministry  of  Public Works  and Transport (MPWT),  Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  Tonle  Sap  Authority, \nMinistry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts,  and  Ministry  of  Rural  Development.

The project will coordinate frequently with \nthese agencies.  \n\n9. \nThe  role  of  provincial  and  municipal  governments  in  decentralized  urban  management \nand service delivery is evolving with the gradual assignment of functions from line Ministries to \nsubnational governments under the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital City, \nProvincial  and  District  Towns  (Organic  Law  2008).  The  Ministry  of  Interior  is  responsible  for \npublic  administration  and  subnational  matters  and  the  National  Committee  for  Sub-National \nDemocratic  Development \nfor  promoting  democratic \ndevelopment  through  decentralization  and  deconcentration  reforms.  Provincial  departments  of \nline  ministries  (through  municipalities)  are  responsible  for  O&M,  private  sector  contract \nmanagement and service delivery. The project will address the larger issue of sustainability by \nestablishing semi-autonomous agencies (urban services units [USUs]) for urban services.  \n\ninter-ministerial  mechanism \n\nthe \n\nis \n\nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \n10. \nRectangular  Strategy  Phase  III;  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2014\u20132018;  the \nOrganic  Law  and  Sub-decrees;  the Cambodia Climate  Change Strategic  Plan  2014\u20132023;  the \nNational Adaptation Programme of Action for Climate Change; and the ASEAN Clean Tourism \nCity  Standard  initiative.  It  focuses  on  the  Tonle  Sap  provinces  prioritized  in  2013  for \nprogramming  because  of  higher  than  national  average  poverty  rates  and  incidence  of  female \nilliteracy.  The  project  has  synergies  with  other  ADB  and  development  partner  projects.11 It  is \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia,  2014\u20132018; country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  Cambodia,  2015\u20132017;  and  urban  operational  plan,  2011\u20132020  under \nStrategy  2020;  and  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.  The  project  focuses  on  achieving \nsustainable  and  inclusive  development  by  transforming  key  urban  areas  into  competitive  and \ngreen urban centers; thereby strengthening rural-urban subregion connectivity and linkages.12  \n\n11. \nADB  has  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  urban  sector,  together  with  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  and  German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit \n(GIZ). It assisted the government to launch the Tonle Sap Initiative following development of the \nTonle Sap Basin Strategy in 2005. Lessons have been incorporated from ADB\u2019s experience in \nimplementing urban  development  projects  in  Cambodia  into  the  project design. These  lessons \ninclude the need for strengthening institutional capacity and skills in project implementation and \nmanagement; implementing resettlement in partnership with the government; facilitating sector \ncoordination  and  stakeholder  consultations;  and  establishing  a  special  operating  agency  and \naccount for O&M of decentralized services for improved sustainability.13  \n\n                                                \n11  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB. 2014.

The  outcome  will  be  improved  urban  services  and  enhanced  climate \nchange resilience in Kampong Chhnang and Pursat municipalities. The project will enhance the \nurban  environment,  improve  public  health,  and  contribute  to  better  quality,  coverage  and \nreliability of services to more than 100,000 residents in the municipalities of Kampong Chhnang \nand  Pursat. This  will  be  achieved  through  an  integrated  program  of  physical  and non-physical \ninfrastructure \nin \ninvestments.  The  project \nincorporates  climate \ndevelopment, with support from the Pilot Program Climate Resilience (PPCR).14  \n\nresilience  measures \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nOutput  1:  Kampong  Chhnang  urban  area  environmental  improvements  include  flood \nprotection  totaling  15.1  km  along  Tonle  Sap  riverbank  through  improvement  of  the  existing \nembankment  and  construction  of  a  new  embankment  where  required;  construction  of  a  new \ncontrolled  landfill  site  of  10  ha  at  Phnom  Tauch  village  with  increased  capacity;  provision  of \nequipment  for  solid  waste  collection;  and  landfill  management,  including  supervised  closing  of \ntwo open dumpsites in Kul Kuk village and Trork village. It complements the Japan International \nCooperation Agency\u2019s drainage project in the municipality and GIZ\u2019s support for development of \nan  urban  master  plan.  Embankment  protection  will  prevent  flooding  from  the  Tonle  Sap  into \nKampong Chhnang town, reducing its vulnerability to flooding and providing protection to 1 in 50 \nyear high water levels. In the dry season, outlets will accommodate the natural streams flowing \ninto the Tonle Sap, and sluice gates will avoid backflow into the town as the water rises. In the \nwet season, natural retention areas will retain wet season flows. The embankment is imperative \nfor  residents  to  have  continued  access  to  social  services  and  economic  activities  in  the  town \n(e.g., rice processing mills). Improved flood protection will assist farmers in the eastern part of \nthe municipality to increase agricultural production from two to three crops per year.  \n\n14. \nOutput 2: Pursat urban area environmental improvements include construction of about \n9.9 km of primary and secondary drains in the town center with associated road improvements \nand  improved  wastewater  treatment;  riverbank  erosion  protection  in  select  locations  along  the \nPursat  River,  including  revetment  and  groins;  development  of  a  new  controlled  landfill  site  of \nabout 28 ha at Toul Mkak village; provision of equipment for solid waste collection; and landfill \nmanagement,  including  equipment  and  supervised  closing  of  two  old  open  dumpsites  in  Toul \nMkak  village and Sras  Srang  village.  It  complements  ADB\u2019s  previous  support to the  Dhamnak \nChheukrom Irrigation System Rehabilitation (located about 40 km upstream). About 20% of the \ntown\u2019s roads have drains connected to National Highway No. 5. Town drainage will improve the \nstormwater  drainage  system  to  accommodate  more  intensive  rainfall.  It  will  support  increased \neconomic activities in the town, and facilitate residents\u2019 continued access to social services.  \n\n15. \nOutput 3: Community mobilization and environmental improvements aim to address the \nclimate  change  and  environmental  needs  of  the  urban  poor  and  vulnerable,  including  ethnic \nCham and Vietnamese in Kampong Chhnang and Pursat\u2014making the project more inclusive.

Urban \n22. \narea improvements are prioritized and target areas where there is maximum positive impact on \nlocal communities and the environment. Engineering solutions for infrastructure and equipment \nare  appropriate  and  have  been  developed  based  on  technical  viability  and  compatibility  with \nlocal  conditions,  particularly  local  O&M  capacity.  Climate  resilience  measures  will  also  help \nreduce  maintenance  costs  and  prolong  the  life  of  the  infrastructure  investment.  Contract \npackages  will  attract  contractors  with  skills  and  experience  to  ensure  the  durability  and \ncontinuity of the proposed infrastructure. Community-driven improvements will respond to local \nplanning  and  prioritization  results.  Household  sanitation  improvements  will  be  based  on \nfunction,  cost,  and  long-term  durability  in  an  urban  setting.  The  plan  for  climate  change \nadaptation  in  urban  areas  and  revised  building  codes  will  strengthen  climate  resilience \nmeasures in this and other projects.18   \n\n                                                \n18   A  sanitary  landfill  is  not  feasible  in  Kampong  Chhnang  or  Pursat  owing  to  high  initial  and  operating  costs,  low \n\nvolumes of waste generated, high levels of technical expertise required, and people\u2019s low willingness to pay. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe  project  contributes  to  the  improved  economic  welfare  of  project  residents.  Flood \ncontrol components result in significant benefits in savings from property damages avoided and \nsavings  from  the  agricultural  and  commercial  losses  resulting  from  reduced  flooding  in  both \ntowns. Economic benefits for the SWM components are reduced health risks from poor SWM as \nmeasured  through  savings  in  the  Disability  Adjusted  Life  Years  attributable  to  poor  SWM  for \nresidents. Base case results indicate that subprojects are economically viable with an estimated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) that exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12%.  Base  case  EIRRs  for  flood  protection  and  SWM  are  18.22%  and  16.64%  for  Kampong \nChhnang  and  16.88%  and  14.50%  for  Pursat.  Sensitivity  analysis  showed  that  the  EIRRs  are \nmost  vulnerable  to  changes  in  anticipated  benefits.  The  financial  viability  of  the  project\u2019s  only \nrevenue  earning  component  was  assessed;  the  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  for \nSWM  improvements  are  5.98%  for  Kampong  Chhnang  and  9.59%  for  Pursat.  The  FIRRs \nexceed  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.33%  indicating  financial  viability.  Sensitivity \ntests indicate that the FIRRs would be most susceptible to reductions in revenues.  Levy of an \nenvironment sanitation fee will help USUs recover O&M costs and gradual depreciation.19 USUs \nwith a dedicated account will  facilitate collection and use of user fees for O&M. Results of the \nfinancial projections indicate that user fees can adequately fund O&M of the controlled landfill, \ngarbage collection, and flood control assets during the first 10 years of operation with minimal \ngovernment subsidies. The user fees are affordable based on a fee affordability analysis.20  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nA financial management  and  a  procurement  capacity  assessment  of the executing  and \n24. \nimplementing  agencies  confirmed  the  adequacy  of  project  implementation  and  financial \nmanagement arrangements. The MPWT has experience in managing externally funded projects \nand  has  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake  international  and  national  competitive  bidding  for  civil \nworks packages. Lessons from ADB projects will guide implementation, financial management, \nand  accounting.  The  assessments  indicated  limited  capacity  at  the  subnational  level,  so  the \nPMU will manage all procurement activities and will involve the subnational level in the process. \nA subaccount will be established in each PIU for operational costs, and a special account solely \nfor  depositing  revenue  collected  from  the  environmental  sanitation  fee  for  USUs  with  strict \nreplenishment measures. Output 5 will support PMU and PIU staff. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the \nMPWT. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nThe  project  will  have  positive  social  and  economic  impacts  on  residents  in  Kampong \nChhnang  and  Pursat.  They  will  be  able  to  access  livelihood  and  commercial  opportunities \nthrough  an  improvement  in  their  living  conditions  and  public  health.  The  project  will  improve \nphysical  accessibility;  reduce  vulnerability  risk;  and  enhance  local  ownership  and  sanitation \nawareness.  Measures  are  included  to  ensure  that  project  benefits  reach  the  urban  poor  and \nvulnerable groups, such as the ethnic Cham, Vietnamese and floating communities in Kampong \nChhnang.  Safety  features,  such  as  sidewalks  and  solar  lamps  are  incorporated  for  the  river \nembankment in Kampong Chhnang and the drainage in Pursat. The project is effective gender \nmainstreaming and has a gender action plan. NGOs and civil society organization contributed to \nthe project design and will continue during implementation. \n                                                \n19 Environmental sanitation fees include garbage collection fees, drainage, and/or flood control service changes. \n20 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n26. \nThe  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  estimated  78,815.25  m2  of  land  (56,945.75 m2 [public] \nand 21,869.50 m2 [private]) will be acquired for the project. About 139 affected households (or \n576  affected  persons)  will  incur  minor  impacts  resulting  from  the  loss  of  fixed  assets  and \nsources of incomes or livelihoods. About 25 affected households (108 affected persons) will be \nseverely affected by loss of agricultural land or permanent loss of land use equivalent to 10% or \nmore of their total productive assets. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is \n$257,393.53, including base costs, allowances, contingencies and administration costs. This will \nbe updated after detailed design and the detailed measurement survey. Administrative costs of \nthe  grievance  committee  for  grievance resolution  will  be  borne  by  the  project.  A  cutoff  date  in \neach  town  has  been  established  with  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation.  Project \ninformation was shared with affected people during project preparation. Information booklets will \nbe  disclosed  at  commune  offices  and  will  be  distributed  to  affected  households  during  the \ndetailed measurement survey. An external monitoring organization will confirm compliance with \nthe resettlement plans and will submit monitoring and post-project evaluation reports.21 \n\n27. \nThe  indigenous  peoples  safeguard  category  is  B.  Ethnic  Cham  and  Vietnamese  were \nidentified  and  meaningfully  consulted  in  Kampong  Chhnang  villages.  They  live  alongside  the \nKhmer  majority  and  are  well  integrated  the  larger  community.  Design features  are  included  to \nensure the ethnic Cham and Vietnamese are beneficiaries and are meaningfully consulted. The \nKampong Chhnang river embankment in some parts will be constructed parallel to the existing \nalignment to avoid resettlement impacts. Output 3 pre-identifies villages where ethnic Cham and \nVietnamese  are  a  majority  of  beneficiaries.  Elements  of  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  are \nintegrated in the project design in lieu of a stand-alone indigenous peoples plan. \n\n28. \nThe  environment  safeguard  category  is  B.  Initial  environmental  examinations  and  an \nenvironmental assessment review framework have been prepared. Climate resilience measures \nare integrated into the project. Environmental impacts are related to siting, design, construction, \nand operation; and mitigation measures are part of the environment management plans (EMPs). \nEMPs have been prepared for SWM, embankment protection, drainage, and riverbank erosion \nprotection, and will form part of the bidding and contract documents. Potential adverse impacts \nduring construction are expected to be temporary and will be mitigated through the EMPs. The \nproject includes budget and institutional arrangements for EMP implementation and monitoring. \n\nSafeguard  documents  are  prepared  in  consultation  with  communities  and  according  to \n29. \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws. 22 They are approved and posted on \nthe ADB website, and will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and cleared by ADB \nprior to contract awards. A grievance redress mechanism will facilitate resolution of complaints.  \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30. \nThe  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23  \n\n                                                \n21  Lessons  from  previous  project  implementation  have  been  considered,  including  the  importance  of  good  design, \n\ngrievance redressal, frequent monitoring and implementation capacity. \n\n22  Resettlement  Plans,  Initial  Environmental  Examination  Plans,  and  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n\n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nEconomic activities are adversely affected by natural \ndisasters and lack of climate change impacts. \nMunicipalities are not prepared to collect revenues for \noperation and maintenance of urban infrastructure. \nProject start-up delays increase the number of affected \npeople along the embankment alignment. \nCivil  society  or  nongovernment  organizations \nconcerns during project implementation. \nDhamnak Chheukrom Irrigation System Rehabilitation \nworks (upstream) does not lower flood levels of Pursat \nriver in town center after completion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nraise \n\nMitigating Measures \nClimate change impacts are identified and included in the \ndesign of infrastructure investments.  \nA  special  operating  agency  and  account  will  be \nestablished to collect and manage user fees. \nA  project  implementation  specialist  will  be  recruited  to \nassist in accelerating project start-up. \nCivil  society  or  nongovernment  organizations  will  be \npartners in project implementation.  \nA detailed hydrological survey of the Pursat River will be \nconducted after completion of works. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n31. \nThe  government  and  the  MPWT,  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  PDPWTs  and \nmunicipalities of Kampong Chhnang and Pursat have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan and grant documents.
