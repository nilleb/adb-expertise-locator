The  share  of \nthermal power in the generation mix remains high at 67.2% in 2016 as the entire demand growth \nhas been served by oil-fired thermal (31.5%) and coal (35.7%) generation. Although 32.8% of the \ntotal generated power provided to the grid in 2016 was from renewable sources, including 24.6% \nlarge hydropower, 5.2% small hydropower, 2.4% wind power, and 0.6% other sources, the high \nshare of oil-fired thermal generation makes electricity expensive due to high fuel prices, and poses \na serious threat to the country\u2019s energy security and the environment.2 There is an urgent need \nto develop other clean energy sources in addition to hydropower, undertake loss reduction efforts, \nand address energy efficiency issues. Diversification to renewable energy sources, such as wind \nand solar energy, will improve the country\u2019s energy security and the environment.  \n \n4. \nDeveloping  wind  power  generation  by  both  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  through \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  provides  substantial  opportunities  to  reach  the  country\u2019s  goal  of \nincreasing  the  share  of  nonconventional  renewable  energy  generation  to  20%  of  the  total \ngenerated power by 2020.3 In 2016, total installed wind power generation capacity in Sri Lanka \nwas  131  MW,  of  which  128  MW  were  constructed  by  the  private  sector.  This  wind  power \ngeneration  capacity  allowed  the  production  of  343  gigawatt-hours.  The  feed-in-tariff  for  wind \npower of about SLRs23 per kilowatt-hour that is applicable to wind power plants with capacity of \nup to 10 MW is considered high compared with the world standards. This could be reduced if, \ninstead of the feed-in-tariff, a competitive bidding is applied for new wind power installations. \n \n5. \nThe  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  aims  to  ensure  the  sustainable  development  of  energy \nresources  by  improving  the  power  supply  systems  to  guarantee  that  the  entire  population  has \naccess to electricity services. Sri Lanka has a national sector investment program that is based \non the National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka.4 The policy and strategies include a \nsector road map, and policy and reform measures. To reduce the current high cost of thermal \n\n                                                \n1  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2017. Statistical Digest 2016. Colombo.  \n2  The year 2016 was a dry year with substantially less rains that resulted in the decrease of hydropower generation \n\nwith corresponding increase in oil-fired generation. \n\n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2015. Sri Lanka Energy Sector Development Plan for a Knowledge Based Economy 2015\u2013\n2025.  Colombo.  Nonconventional  renewable  energy  includes  mini  hydro  up  to  10  megawatts  (MW),  wind,  solar, \nbiomass, tide, and geothermal power generation sources. \n\n4  Government of Sri Lanka. 2008. National Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n\n\fpower  generation  and  attain  cost  recovery,  the  government  developed  900  MW  of  low  cost       \ncoal-fired capacity that became fully operational in 2014. The government aims to increase supply \ncapacity from renewable energy sources and potential future conversion of the oil-fired plants to \ngas-fired plants. The policies and incentives for developing renewable energy sources exist in the \ncountry.  The  increase  to  20%  of  power  generation  from  nonconventional  renewable  energy \nsources,  including  their  current  generation,  will  be  in  addition  to  24.6%  (2016)  of  conventional \nhydropower and will ensure that, in the future, a substantial portion of electricity is generated by \ndomestic clean energy sources. This will address the critical issue of energy security. \n \n6. \nValue added by ADB assistance. The project will contribute to the government\u2019s goal of \nexpanding access to electricity and developing clean energy.5 This innovative, high technology \nproject represents the development of the first 100 MW wind park in Sri Lanka.6 It will create an \nenabling environment for wind power development through the use of a public\u2013private partnership \napproach in the future. The project will (i) build CEB\u2019s capacity to act as a wind park developer to \nattract the private sector in future wind power generation through competitive bidding; (ii) help to \nbenchmark capital and operational costs to be used in competitive bidding for private sector wind \npower development projects; and (iii) improve CEB\u2019s capacity to forecast, control, and manage \nintermittent renewable energy in the power system through dedicated control centers. The project \nwill  also  help to  continue  an  ongoing  and  essential  dialogue  with the  government  on  pursuing \npower subsector reforms in coordination with other interested parties and development partners. \n \n7. \nThe project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy  for  Sri  Lanka. 7  It  has  strong  grounds  on  previous  ADB  interventions  focused  on \nsupporting  investments  in  power  transmission  and  distribution  to  expand  access  to  clean  and \nreliable electricity and renewable energy development.8 The project considers lessons relating to \ngrid  integration  of  renewable  energy  and  strengthening  CEB\u2019s  capacity  in  complex  project \nsupervision  from  the  previous  projects,  and  incorporates  them  in  improved  implementation \narrangements and project design. It will support the sustainable development of the energy sector \n\n                                                \n5   The project is included in ADB. 2017.

The project will have the following outcome: clean \npower generation increased.10 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n9. \nOutput  1:  Wind  power  generation  capacity  increased.  This  output  consists  of  three \nsubcomponents:  (i)  100  MW  wind  power  park  constructed  in  Mannar  Island  in  the  Northern \nProvince;11 (ii)  wind  park  infrastructure  developed  that  involves  construction  of  the  wind  park\u2019s \ninternal medium voltage infrastructure, internal cabling, access roads, and other arrangements; \nand (iii) a renewable energy dispatch control center established to forecast, control, and manage \nintermittent 100 MW wind power generation.12 \n \n10. \nOutput 2: System reactive power management improved.  This includes installation of \n100 megavolt-ampere reactive (MVAr) reactors at the 220 kilovolt (kV) level at the Anuradhapura \ngrid substation in the North Central Province, and a 50 MVAr reactor at the 220 kV level at the \nMannar  grid substation  in  the  Northern  Province  to  manage  voltage  levels  within  the  planning \nlimits and practical operational requirements, and ensure reliable operation of the wind park. \n \n11. \nOutput  3:  Capacity  of  CEB  in  project  engineering  design  review  and  supervision \nstrengthened.    Expert  consultancy  services  will  be  procured  to  strengthen  CEB\u2019s  capacity  in \nproject  engineering  design,  review,  and  supervision.  These  advisory  consultancy  services  will \nassist  CEB  in  ensuring  engineering  oversight  of  wind  turbine  installation,  commissioning  and \ntesting activities, and technical certification of contractor\u2019s activities throughout the construction \nperiod. \n \nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $256.7 million (Table 1). \n\n12. \n \n13. \nDetailed  cost  estimates  by  expenditure  category  and  by  financier  are  included  in  the \nproject administration manual (PAM).13 The expenditure categories will include turnkey contracts \nfor the wind plant, consisting of the 100 MW wind farm, internal infrastructure, and a renewable \nenergy dispatch control center, the 150 MVAr reactors, and consultancy services for the project \nengineering design review and supervision. \n\n                                                \n9  ADB  continuously  coordinates  with  major  development  partners  in  Sri  Lanka,  including  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. JICA is planning to finance \nthe construction of a pumped storage in 2020 that would allow using wind power generated during off-peak hours for \nstoring hydroelectric energy for load balancing rather than curtailing generation at the proposed wind park and other \ngeneration facilities. \n\n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 Mannar  Island  was  identified  as  high  wind  resource  potential  area  based  on  studies  of  the  National  Renewable \nEnergy  Laboratory  (USA),  Sustainable  Energy  Authority  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  actual  wind  measurements  and  wind \nresource  assessment  at  the  proposed  site  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  Preparing  the  Clean  Energy  and  Network \nEfficiency Improvement Project at the government\u2019s request (footnote 8).  \n\n12 Detailed Description of Project Outputs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

A steering committee, chaired by the \nsecretary of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, will guide CEB and review progress \nand  results.  CEB  will  set  up  a  project  management  unit  (PMU).  The  PMU  will  oversee \nprocurement,  disbursement,  financial  management  and  accounting,  quality  assurance,  social, \nand environmental issues, and will coordinate with the procurement committee, appointed by the \ncabinet or the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, depending on the contract size. Full-\ntime managers will supervise each project output under the project. \n \n18. \nThe  government  and  CEB  have  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  for \nprocurement of goods and civil works, including preparing bidding documents, and inviting and \nreceiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing under the project. Retroactive financing will \nbe allowed for up to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness. \nThe  government  and  CEB  were  advised  that  ADB's  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to finance any part of the project. \n \n19. \nthe PAM. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated loan closing date \nManagement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n1 January 2018\u201331 December 2021 \n31 December 2021 \n30 June 2022 \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nSteering committee consisting of the secretary, MPRE (chair) and \nrepresentatives of MDA, MNPEA, MOFMM, MPRE, and CEB \nCEB \n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  CEB \n(iv)  Project management unit \n\nProcurementa \n\nConsulting services \nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\n2 contracts \n\n$172.6 million \n\n1 consulting contract \n\nEstablished in CEB \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nFirm (QCBS) \nAdvance contracting, including preparation of bidding documents, \ninviting and receiving bids for contracts, and retroactive financing of \nup to 20% of the loan amount for expenditures incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness, but no earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe loan agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between CEB and ADB. \n\n$1.0 million \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CEB  =  Ceylon  Electricity  Board,  MDA  =  Ministry  of  Development  Assignments, \nMNPEA = Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, MOFMM = Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, MPRE \n= Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \na  Excludes local taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe project will use modern, proven wind power generation technologies and innovative \n20. \napproaches in forecasting, controlling, and managing intermittent renewable energy in the power \nsystem through the dedicated control center. CEB conducted technical studies for the proposed \noutputs  with  support  from  the  consultants  engaged  under  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance financed by ADB (footnote 6). ADB followed up with its own assessment and found \nthe  technical  studies  generally  acceptable.  The  work  undertaken  indicates  that  the  proposed \ntechnical solutions are feasible and execution arrangements are satisfactory. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nAn  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  and  its  expected  economic \nperformance was undertaken through a cost-benefit analysis, by comparing with\u2013 and without\u2013\nproject  scenarios,  and  conducted  using  ADB  guidelines  for  economic  analysis. 15  Economic \nanalysis was carried out at the output level. All project outputs have been confirmed as least cost, \nwith sound economic rationale for investment. The main economic benefits identified, quantified, \nand valued include additional clean power generation and improvements through better reactive \npower management. The aggregate economic internal rate of return of the project was estimated \nat 16.6%; above the assumed economic hurdle rate of 9%. Various scenarios were modeled to \ntest the sensitivity of estimated economic returns to key assumptions. In all cases, the aggregate \neconomic internal rate of return exceeded the 9% hurdle rate, reflecting the project\u2019s expected \nrobust economic performance. \n \n22. \nFinancial viability of the proposed investment was examined by comparing the incremental \ncosts and benefits on a with- and without-investment basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor financial management and analysis of projects.16 The overall internal rate of return of the three \noutputs was estimated at 4.2%, which compares favorably with the project\u2019s weighted average \ncost  of  capital  of  2.6%.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  also  undertaken  to  test  the  robustness  of  the \nproject\u2019s  financial  performance,  and  preliminary  results  indicate  that  the  overall  investment \nremains viable under scenarios modeled. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nCEB  is  one  of  two  power  utilities  in  the  country.  CEB  is  a  vertically  integrated  utility \ncomprising six functional business units (FBUs). The Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages \nefficiency improvements of CEB by regulating each FBU. The act empowers the Public Utilities \nCommission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent regulator for energy and water established \nunder the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate the electricity supply industry. PUCSL regulates each \nFBU separately under individual licenses. Financial accounts are segregated to allow each FBU \nto  operate  as  a  profit  center,  and  a  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  was  developed. \nHowever,  the  process  of  delegating  day-to-day  management  and  financial  decision  making  to \nFBU heads is not complete and the transfer-pricing scheme is not functioning properly. PUCSL \nestablished a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. \n \n\n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fCEB has the necessary capacity to undertake the project. It was the implementing agency \n24. \nfor  past  ADB-financed  projects  and  has  managed  investments  funded  by  other  development \npartners.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  CEB  concludes  that  it  can  fulfill  ADB\u2019s \nfiduciary requirements for the project. CEB regularly faces cash shortfalls because of low tariffs, \nexpensive power generation, and expensive short-term loans. These shortcomings need to be \ncorrected. Under the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, all tariffs must reflect costs; and Treasury will bear \nthe cost of any government-approved subsidy. The tariff order issued by PUCSL in January 2011 \nincreased the average electricity tariff by about 8%. In February 2012, PUCSL implemented a fuel \nadjustment  formula  for  certain  customer  categories.  In  April  2013,  retail  electricity  tariffs  were \nincreased  by  35%  on  average.  Subsequently, the government  has  converted  CEB\u2019s  long-term \ndebt into equity. \n \nThe financial management capacity of CEB is assessed as acceptable for the project. The \n25. \noverall financial management risk is assessed as moderate and several risk mitigation measures \nwill be implemented. Details of the financial management assessments of CEB are available in \nthe PAM and in the assessment of CEB\u2019s financial performance and projections.17 CEB\u2019s financial \nperformance  has  improved  in  2013\u20132015,  particularly  in  2015  due  to  better  rainfall  and,  thus, \nhigher low-cost hydropower generation. However, lack of rains reduced hydropower generation \nand  increased  the  average  power  generation  cost  in  2016.  CEB\u2019s  financial  sustainability  will \ndepend on the extent to which the utility is allowed to charge its customers fully cost-reflective \ntariffs to service debt, and to undertake a prudent capital and operating expenditure program. The \ngovernment intends to improve financial management and efficiency in CEB, and advance CEB \ninternal  reforms  envisaged  under  the  Sri  Lanka  Electricity  Act.  This  is  consistent  with  public \nfinancial management and state enterprise reforms agreed in June 2016 by the government with \nthe International Monetary Fund as part of the 3-year program under the Extended Fund Facility \nto support the country\u2019s economic reform agenda.18 \n \n26. \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). An oversight \nrole by ADB will ensure integrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB maintains a \nproject website that will be updated regularly and includes (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and \ncontract awards; (ii) use of funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  CEB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n27. \nThe project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being through increased power supply from clean wind energy in Mannar Island. The \nproject  will  ensure greater  access to  a stable supply  of  electricity to industrial  and  commercial \ncustomers  and  to  the  general  public,  which  will  promote  business  expansion  and  create \nemployment  opportunities  to the  local  communities,  including  poor  and socially  disadvantaged \npeople, during the implementation phase. The project is expected to generate jobs for skilled and \nunskilled laborers, including poor, vulnerable groups, and women, during construction.

A loan agreement will include a standard assurance related to the compliance with \nhost  country  labor  standards  for  contractors.  Stakeholder  dialogue  and  communications  were \ncarried out during the project design stage and will continue during implementation. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n28. \ncategories are as follows.19 \n \n29. \nEnvironment (category A). The project is classified as environment category A due to its \nenvironmentally  sensitive  location  on  a  migratory  bird  route  and  potential  impacts.20 Following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  national  regulations,  a  draft  environmental  impact \nassessment  (EIA),  including  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  was  prepared  and \ndisclosed in ADB\u2019s website on 18 May 2017. Any update of the EIA resulting from a change in \nproject scope will be similarly disclosed. Mitigation measures are proposed in the EIA and EMP \nto minimize habitat and species disturbance, and impact on fishermen\u2019s livelihood, health, and \nsafety as a result of project construction, noise, shadow flicker and visual impacts, and potential \nbird  collision  with  the  wind  turbines  during  operation. 21  Implementation  of  the  biodiversity \nmanagement plan that is being developed will ensure no net loss of biodiversity at the wind power \ngeneration  site. 22 Public  consultations  and  focus  group  meetings  were  conducted  with  local \ncommunities,  fishermen,  women,  government  authorities,  and  nongovernment  organizations, \nincluding  ornithological  societies.  Their  feedback  was  taken  into  account  during  the  project \ndesign. Public concerns are identified in the EIA, and mitigation measures are incorporated into \nthe EMP. The PMU has dedicated environment specialists for monitoring environment issues and \nimplementing the EMP. \n \nCEB  has  implemented  several  ADB  projects,  including  category  A  projects,23 and  has \n30. \nto  manage  environmental  risks  during \nadequate \npreconstruction,  construction,  and  operation.  The  EMP  will  be  incorporated  into  civil  works \ncontracts,  giving  contractors  the  primary  responsibility  for  implementation  during  construction. \nCEB  will  supervise  construction  and  EMP  implementation.  CEB  will  provide  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB quarterly during construction and annually during operation, and retain \nqualified external experts or nongovernment organizations to verify monitoring information of the \nproject for the environment. A corrective action plan will be prepared and implemented for any \nunanticipated environmental impacts and noncompliance issues. The contractors and CEB will \nadhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national environmental regulations. In the event \n\ninstitutional  capacity  and  experience \n\n                                                \n19 ADB.

The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement.24 The acquisition of approximately 90.3 hectares (ha) of private land is \nrequired for 39 wind turbines,25 2.21 kilometers of new access roads, and one new staff building. \nThe number of the affected entities are 39 joint owners, five companies, and other unidentified \nowners.26 CEB will purchase 12.5 ha of land from four joint private owners and two companies. \nThe remaining 77.8 ha of land will be procured through a land acquisition process. The land to be \nacquired is hardly used for any productive or residential purposes and is free of encumbrances. \nAll the landowners have other income sources, and no vulnerable households are present among \nthe identified landowners. Neither physical displacements nor significant resettlement impacts are \nanticipated  due  to  the  project.  The  turbines  and  power  evacuation  line  from  the  wind  park  to \nNadukuda pooling substation will be connected through 33 kV underground cables following the \nright  of  way  of  the  access  roads.  No  land  acquisition  is  expected  for  a  new  pier,  but  fishing \nactivities may be temporarily affected. The project\u2019s social impacts  were adequately assessed, \nand compensation will be paid to the affected people commensurate to the impacts. Budgetary \nprovisions are in place to compensate affected people in a timely manner for the losses, if and \nwhen they occur. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  in  2016\u20132017  and  will  continue  during  project  implementation. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national regulations, the draft resettlement plan \nwas disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 8 June 2017. Any update of the resettlement plan resulting \nfrom  a  change  in  project  scope  will  be  disclosed.    Impacts  due  to  noise  and  turbine  toppling \ndistance were assessed based on a preliminary design of the wind farm, and mitigation measures \nhave been prepared. One of the mitigation options is to adjust the locations of sensitive receptors \nand relocate potentially affected structures.27 The numbers of affected structures and people will \nbe known after finalization of engineering designs by the contractor, as the impacts depend on \nthe  number  of  turbines  and  their  specification.  The  impacts  will  then  be  assessed  and  the \nresettlement plan will be updated. CEB has implemented several ADB projects and is capable of \nconducting resettlements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. CEB will monitor \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan and submit monitoring reports to ADB semiannually.  \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  not  located  in  regions  inhabited  by \n32. \nindigenous population. Therefore, it will not have any impacts on indigenous peoples. Relevant \ndue diligence has been conducted, and the results are incorporated in the resettlement plan. \n \nClimate change impact. The project\u2019s outputs will increase the clean power generation \n33. \ncapacity by 100 MW, which would result in 345,600 megawatt-hour energy generation per year, \nequivalent  to  avoiding  about  265,700  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  year.  The  climate \nchange risk screening confirms that the project has medium climate change risk.28 \n \n\n                                                \n24 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 One turbine requires 150 meters by 150 meters of land, which is 2.25 ha. Among potential 39 wind turbines, two \n\nspecific turbines may not be considered due to interference with navy communication links. \n\n26 Approximately 50 persons will be affected, based on the social survey and number of average household members \n\nin Sri Lanka. \n\n27 CEB  initiated  consultations  for  relocation  of  two  cabanas  with  21  ha  of  land  acquisition  and  two  naval  quarters \nconsidering potential noise impacts, and intends to utilize a portion of CEB\u2019s allocation of project contingencies for \nthe relocation. \n\n28 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient cash generation \nby Ceylon Electricity Board \n(CEB) to fund its operations \n\nPotential difficulties in \nmanaging the grid due to \ninstability resulting from \nintegration of renewable \nwind generation \n\nPotential impact on \nmigratory and congregative \nwater birds in the wetland \narea \nDelays in generation and \ntransmission investments \nUnexpected increase in \nprices of commodities and \nraw materials \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nProgress on energy sector reforms, including (i) an independent energy \nsector regulatory framework, tariff structure rationalization, and internal \nstructural reforms in CEB; (ii) improvement of CEB\u2019s financial \nmanagement; and (iii) commissioning low-cost generation, including from \nhydropower and other renewable energy. \nWind integration requirements are addressed by the system stability \nstudies prepared under the technical assistance provided by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and subsequent studies by CEB; investment for \nrenewable energy integration is included in the second tranche (2016) of \nthe investment program financed by ADB and the project. Changes are \nproposed for regulatory codes and commercial arrangements. \nImplementation of mitigation measures proposed in the environmental \nimpact assessment and environmental management plan; curtailment of \nwind turbines during the bird migratory period; and implementation of the \nbiodiversity management plan to ensure no net loss of biodiversity. \nADB will continue regular dialogue with CEB on required investments and \nprovide timely financial assistance including cofinancing. \nClose supervision by the steering committee and ADB, advance \ncontracting, proactive project implementation, and inclusion of physical \nand price contingencies in the cost estimates. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n35. \nThe  government  and  CEB  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents.
