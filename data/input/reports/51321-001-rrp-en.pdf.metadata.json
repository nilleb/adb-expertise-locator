The longer-term \nfunding provided under the proposed loan will also assist BIDV to better balance its asset\u2013liability \nmaturity profile in line with the recent regulations of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). \n\nII. \n\nTHE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nFinance  sector  overview.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  financial  system  is  relatively  large  in  terms  of \nnumber  of  lenders  for  a  middle-income  country,  with  D10,001  trillion  in  total  assets  for  credit \ninstitutions as of fiscal year (FY) 2017. However, the system remains bank-centric, comprising 35 \ncommercial banks, 2 policy banks, 16 finance companies, 11 leasing companies, 1 cooperative \nbank, people\u2019s credit funds, 3 licensed microfinance institutions, 8 wholly foreign-owned banks, 2 \njoint venture banks, and 51 foreign bank branches in 2017. As of the end of 2017, total financial \nsector assets were D10,001 trillion. The four major state-owned commercial banks\u2014Agribank, \nBIDV, Vietcombank, and VietinBank\u2014continued to dominate banking, accounting for 45.7% of \nsubsector assets in 2017. \n \n4. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  banking  system  has  expanded  rapidly,  paralleling  the  country\u2019s  overall \neconomic growth since liberalization, with average credit growth of 23% per year (2005\u20132017). \nWhile immediate efforts by the SBV to manage these crises were effective, longer-term reform \nmeasures, such as the bank restructuring plan, are still in progress. In line with the SBV\u2019s strategic \nobjective  to  strengthen  the  capital  base  of  domestic  commercial  banks,  the  implementation  of \nBasel II standards is planned by 2020, with 10 banks, including BIDV, currently in the pilot phase. \n \n5. \nSBV\u2019s efforts to tackle the bank\u2019s weak asset quality are also ongoing. In 2013, it adopted \ntighter loan classification standards as part of the measures to maintain the nonperforming loan \n(NPL)  ratio  below  the  prescribed  3.0%.  This  followed  the  establishment  of  the  Vietnam  Asset \nManagement Company (VAMC) in 2013, which buys NPLs from banks in exchange for a special \nclass of zero-interest bonds. Banks gradually provide these bonds, which typically have tenors of \n5  years  (and  exceptionally  10  years),  to  reach  100%  coverage  by  maturity,  at  which  point  the \nNPLs (if still unresolved) are returned to the bank at zero book value in exchange for the fully \nprovisioned bond. In a sector report dated 5 February 2018, Moody\u2019s rates Vietnamese banks\u2019 \nprogress in resolving legacy problem assets as credit positive. The report highlights that with a \nfavorable macroeconomic environment and improved profitability, more banks are now capable \n\n                                                 \n1  BIDV defines SMEs as companies with up to D500 billion of average annual revenues. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fof increasing credit provisions and building up buffers against problem assets, allowing them to \nfully write down their VAMC bond holdings by the end of 2018.2 \n \n6. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises overview. SMEs account for the majority of Viet \nNam\u2019s total business population, amounting to more than 590,000 active businesses.3 According \nto the White Book on Viet Nam\u2019s SMEs published by the Ministry of Plans and Investment, 97.6% \nof enterprises in Viet Nam are SMEs by the labor scale (fewer than 100 employees), accounting \nfor  an  estimated  40%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  over  50%  of  employment.4 Despite  their \nsignificant  contribution  to  the  economy,  SMEs  encounter  numerous  obstacles  that  inhibit  their \noverall development and economic potential. In addition to such constraints as difficulty with land \nuse rights, limited use of technological advancements that could enhance product development, \nand lagging efficiency and productivity, a key obstacle is access to finance. This is echoed by the \nVietnam  Bank  Association,  which  reports  that  Viet  Nam\u2019s  SMEs  have  faced  considerable \nchallenges  in  accessing credit. In  a  2017  market  study  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  SMEs,  the International \nFinance Corporation found that only 47% of male owners and 37% of women owners of SMEs \nhad received bank loans over the preceding 2 years. SMEs located in rural areas would find it \neven  more  difficult  to  access  financing.  The  lack  of  adequate  funding  to  support  the  working \ncapital and investment needs of SMEs has considerable implications, not only for the incremental \ngrowth  of  these  enterprises  and  their  job  creation,  but  also  for  broader  economic  growth.  The \nGovernment of Viet Nam views SMEs as one of its priority areas, as reflected in the recent Law \non Support for SMEs, which became effective in January 2018. The law aims to provide support \nto SMEs through government-sponsored mechanisms such as a new credit guarantee fund, tax \nincentives, subsidies to rent production sites in industrial zones, creation of incubators, training, \nand consultancies. \n\nInvestment  rationale.  Complementing  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  operations  to  reform  and \n7. \nmodernize  Viet  Nam\u2019s  financial  sector,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  has  met  with  several \nbanks in Viet Nam in recent years and seek to partner with suitable financial institutions to provide \nmeaningful  impact  and  enhance  their  ability  to  serve  underbanked  segments.  In  2017,  ADB \napproved a $100 million loan to AB Bank for onlending to SMEs.5 Correspondingly, PSOD has \nidentified BIDV as another partner to promote increased financing to SMEs. BIDV, with an SME \nportfolio of $9.1 billion as of December 2017, is the largest lender to the SME segment. The bank \nhas made lending to SMEs a key strategic priority in line with the government\u2019s efforts to boost \nlending  to  this  segment.  Having  the  second-widest  network  in  the  country,  BIDV  is  in  an \nadvantageous  position  to  increase  access  to  finance  for  SMEs.  It  created  a  specialized  SME \ndepartment, expanded the SME product range, and developed a comprehensive digital strategy \nto augment its distribution channels and improve the SME customer experience. With an expected \nSME  portfolio  growth  of  17.5%  during  FY2018  and  FY2019,  BIDV\u2019s  funding  needs  for  SME \nlending are substantial. ADB\u2019s longer-term financing is particularly impactful in Viet Nam, where \ndebt  markets  are  still  nascent\u2014limiting  the  funding  channels  and  options  for  financial \ninstitutions\u2014and  where  longer-tenor  products  are  needed  to  address  client  demand  and  to \n\n                                                 \n2  Vietnam  News.  2018.

Founded  in  1957  as  a  government  agency  to  finance  infrastructure-related \nprojects during the war, BIDV began providing a full range of banking services at market terms in \n1995. Today, it is the largest bank in Viet Nam with total assets of D1,200,449 billion, a market \ncapitalization  of  D111.8  billion,  859,786  customer  depositors,  more  than  25,000  staff,  190 \nbranches, 854 transaction offices, 1,825 ATMs, and 50,924 points of sale as of FY2017.6 With a \n95.3% government ownership, BIDV is one of four state-owned commercial banks. It has grown \nits gross loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.4% since FY2013 (18.7% \nin 2017, outpacing the overall market\u2019s credit growth of 18% in 2017). BIDV\u2019s deposit base has \ngrown at a CAGR of 23.4% since FY2013, reflecting the strength of its brand name in attracting \ncustomers. In April 2015, BIDV acquired the majority state-owned Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) \nvia  a  stock  swap.  MHB  was  the  fifth-largest  state-owned  bank  in  Viet  Nam,  with  operations \noriginally focused on housing finance, but gradually shifting to agricultural lending in the Mekong \nDelta. BIDV is rated in line with the sovereign; B (short); B+ (long); stable outlook (September \n2017) by S&P, and Ba3 issuers rating, stable outlook (August 2018) by Moody\u2019s. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nOwnership.  BIDV  is  almost  entirely  state-owned  (95.3%  in  FY2017)  through  the  SBV, \nwhile the remaining 4.7% is publicly listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. A sizable portion \nof the public float (2.3%) is held by foreign investors as of FY2017. In line with an overall market \nrally, BIDV\u2019s stock price has more than doubled since March 2017, currently trading at a price\u2013\nbook ratio of 2.2 times. No beneficial owner, apart from the SBV, controls more than 2.0% of its \nshares. BIDV is currently in discussions with potential strategic and financial investors to raise \nadditional capital and support the government\u2019s plan to reduce its stake in BIDV to 65% by 2020. \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted.7 No significant or potentially significant integrity risks were \nidentified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nCorporate governance. BIDV follows a three-tiered corporate governance structure: the \n10. \nshareholder\u2019s general assembly, the board of directors (BOD), and the supervisory board. The \nBOD  has  eight  members,  including  one  independent  director  and  two  executive  directors  (the \nchief  executive  officer  [CEO]  and  the  chief  controller).  All  non-independent  directors  are \nnominated by SBV and are generally former members of senior management of BIDV or MHB. \nThe only independent director, Le Viet Cuong, is from academia and held the position of chief of \noffice in SBV. The BOD meets monthly and has four committees responsible for human resources, \nrisk management, IT, and strategy and organization. A three-member supervisory board acts on \nbehalf  of  the  shareholders  as  a  bridge  between  shareholders  and  the  BOD  to  objectively \nsupervise and assess business operations, corporate governance, and the financial performance \nof BIDV. The three members are elected by the shareholders and also have audit and compliance \nsupervision functions. \n \n11.  Management. The management team has 11 members: the CEO, nine senior executive \nvice presidents, and the chief accountant. All have extensive banking experience, in most cases \n                                                 \n6   All  BIDV  numbers  related  to  the  financial  statements  are  under  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards, \n\n7  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nexclusively with BIDV, with very long tenures on average. The CEO, Phan Duc Tu, joined BIDV \nin 1987 as a branch manager and became CEO in 2012. He holds a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration  and  has  been  the  chairperson  of  the  Vietnam  Bankers  Association.  The \nmanagement  team  is  organized  in  various  committees,  e.g.,  asset  and  liability  management \ncommittee, credit committee, and off-balance sheet debt sale committee. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nUse of proceeds. BIDV will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to finance business loans to \n\n \nA. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  senior  unsecured  loan  to  BIDV  of  up  to  $200  million  in  up  to  two \n12. \ntranches in tenors of up to 5 years. ADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $100,000,000 \namong commercial banks and other eligible B loan participants on a best-effort basis and subject \nto market conditions. ADB also expects to provide a transaction technical assistance (TA) grant \nof up to $1,000,000.8 The TA is expected to support BIDV\u2019s digital finance strategy, strengthen \nenvironmental and social standards, and enhance its risk management capabilities, as well as \nenable it to start tracking loans to SMEs owned by women and developing targeted marketing \nand product strategies. \n \nB. \n \n13. \nSMEs in Viet Nam. Not less than 25% of ADB\u2019s A loan will be used for SMEs in rural areas. \n \n14.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. BIDV will, at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with financial \nreports\u2014(i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial statements, (iii) \nquarterly  compliance  certificates for financial  covenants,  (iv) semiannual  reporting  on the  SME \nloan portfolios, (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed upon by ADB and \nBIDV, and (vi) an annual environmental and social management system performance report. \n \n15. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nSupporting the growth of SMEs. ADB\u2019s funding will support the growth of SMEs, which \nare the backbone of the Vietnamese economy and lack access to finance, particularly of longer \ntenors. By partnering with a bank that has a large network and an established and growing SME \nbusiness line, ADB can maximize its development footprint. In addition to providing SMEs with \nfunding  to  support  working  capital  and  investment  needs,  the  proposed  transaction  will  also \ncontribute to broader economic growth and job creation. ADB\u2019s funding will also target SMEs in \nmore underdeveloped areas in the country and ADB has also set a target for the bank to increase \nits lending to SMEs owned by women. \n \n17. \nProviding access to longer-tenor debt. To support growth of its SME portfolio and better \nservice  its  smaller  customers  with  longer-term  products,  BIDV  needs  longer-tenor  financing  to \n\nEvaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB at least annually. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n                                                 \n8  The TA will be processed separately. \n\n \n\n\fCatalyzing private sector financing. ADB will be providing a B loan of up to $100 million, \n\ncomply  with  regulatory  requirements  that  restrict  the  ratio  of  short-term  funding  to  long-term \nfunding.  ADB\u2019s  5-year  loan  will  help  BIDV  increase the  average tenor  of its  SME  portfolio  and \nclose part of this funding gap. About 90% of BIDV\u2019s funding is still below 1 year, while 25% of its \nSME book has tenors above 1 year. About $2 billion per annum is needed to support its SME \nportfolio growth, which is not readily available given the relatively underdeveloped nature of the \ncountry\u2019s capital markets. ADB\u2019s A and B loans represent 15% of BIDV\u2019s 2018 funding needs for \ngrowing its SME portfolio. \n \n18. \nthereby mobilizing private financing for BIDV to help close its large funding gap.  \n \n19. \nEstablishing  market-leading  standards  and  strengthening  capacity.  ADB  will  be \nBIDV\u2019s first development finance institution providing long-term lending. As such, ADB will play \nan  important  role  in  developing  and  supporting  the  bank\u2019s  adoption  of  stronger  social  and \nenvironmental standards and an improved risk management framework. In addition to ADB\u2019s loan, \nADB is preparing to provide TA of up to $1 million to strengthen BIDV\u2019s risk management and \nenvironmental  and  social  systems  by  helping  it  implement  a  new  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  and  support  investments  in  BIDV\u2019s  digital  strategy,  as  well  as \ndevelop systems to track female borrowers and develop a strategy and products to support this \nimportant market segment.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: Viet Nam\u2019s vision for socially \nequitable economic development, better access to finance for the underserved population, and \ndevelopment of the finance sector, as well as the goals of the new Law on Supporting Small and \nMedium Enterprises, i.e., for SMEs to gain better access to finance and land, integrate in global \nvalue chains, and enjoy equal treatment with foreign and bigger firms. \n \n21. \nOutcomes.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcomes:  provision  of  sustainable  and \nlonger-term  financial  services  to  SMEs  increased,  and  BIDV  enabled  to  expand  its  SME \nbusinesses.9 \n \n22. \ntenor financing and (ii) BIDV\u2019s improved processes to manage social and environmental risks. \n \nB. \n \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  emphasizes  its  support  to  the  financial  sector  to  achieve  greater \n23. \nfinancial  inclusion;  gender  equality;  job  creation;  and  access  to  affordable  housing,  insurance, \nand  savings. 10  The  proposed  transaction  contributes  to  financial  sector  development  by \nsupporting the growth of a financial institution that plays a key role in Viet Nam\u2019s finance sector. \n\nOutputs.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and Pacific. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal financial \nservices, underserved segments of the population will be excluded from the growth process and \nits benefits. According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 and country operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will support investments \nthat  promote  more  inclusive  economic  growth  based  on  promoting  job  creation  and \ncompetitiveness.11 The proposed transaction will support the development of SMEs in Viet Nam, \nwhich is part of the inclusive economic growth objective of the country partnership strategy and \nalso  a  high  government  priority,  and  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  strengthen  the  financial \nsector under the Financial Sector Development and Inclusion Program.12 \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThis transaction is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated \nas  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.

Prior to the disbursement of the ADB financing, the company \nwill  design  and  implement  a  project-specific  ESMS  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  requirements.  BIDV  will  use  the  proposed  loan  to  support  SME  finance, \ntargeting customers involved in a variety of industries, including trading, manufacturing, service, \nretail, agribusiness, wholesale, and distribution. BIDV will not use ADB funding to finance projects \nclassified as category A for environmental impacts or category A or B for involuntary resettlement \nor  indigenous  peoples.  BIDV  will  apply  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that \nsubloans using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and comply with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will also comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to \nADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards.13 BIDV will report regularly to ADB on its compliance with such \nlaws, and any measures taken. Information will be disclosed and affected peoples consulted in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  transaction  is  classified  as  having  some  gender \nelements.

ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2016.
