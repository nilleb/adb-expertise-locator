The  Project  will  (i)\nsupport  the  expansion  of  the  small  business  loans\nguarantee  scheme \nthe  existing\nmanagement  framework  that  exists  through  the  Small\nBusiness  Enterprise  Centre  (SBEC);  (ii)  support  a  pilot\nmicrofinance  facility  onlent  through  the  Development\nto  approved  participating\nBank  of  Samoa \norganizations; \na  Small  Business\n(iii) \nDevelopment  Fund \nto  purchase  additional\nbusiness  advisory  and  training  services  from  approved\nbusiness  development  service  (BDS)  providers;  and  (iv)\nsupport the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the\nlegal and regulatory environment for the corporate sector\ngenerally,  in  particular  in  those  areas  that  impact  the\nMSE sector. In addition, as part of the Project, the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  consider  making  an\ninvestment in a venture capital facility targeting MSE.\n\nestablish \n(SBDF) \n\n(DBS) \n\nCategory  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,\nand  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  were\nidentified.\n\nOver 80 percent of all businesses in Samoa have five or\nfewer employees. Most of these enterprises do not have\nadequate skill levels to create, manage, and increase the\nsize  of  their  enterprises.  These  enterprises  lack  equity\nand  access  to  bank  borrowings  to  provide  a  sustainable\nfinancing  basis  for  their  development.  With  at  least  80\npercent  of  land  under  customary  communal  ownership,\nwhich  cannot  be  alienated  either  by  sale  or  mortgage,\nmost  business  enterprises  have \nlimited  choices  of\nacceptable  securities  that  they  can  offer  to  access\nfinancial  services.  The  limited  freehold  land  that  is\navailable for securing borrowings from commercial banks\nis  concentrated  around  the  Apia  urban  area.  Therefore\nis\nthe  problem  of  access \ncompounded \nrural  and  Savai'i-based  business\nenterprises. Use of alternative securities for freehold land\nlimited.  Although  chattels  were  used\nhas  been \nextensively for security,  the  commercial banks no longer\n\nfinancial  services \n\nfor \n\nto \n\n\fplace reliance on such security because of enforceability\nproblems and the state of the relevant registries.\n\nSince 1996, the Government has embarked on a process\nof  economic  reform  and  liberalization,  which  recognizes\nthe  private  sector  as  the  engine  of  growth.  The  reform\nprocess has resulted in an environment that is conducive\nto economic growth.\n\nreforms, \n\nthe  Government \n\nthe  partnership  between \n\nThe Government's statements of economic strategy have\nconsistently  reinforced \nthe\nprivate  sector  and  Government.  After  focusing  on  major\nis  now\nmacroeconomic \ndeveloping strategies to broaden the spread of benefits of\neconomic  growth.  ADB  has  supported  these  efforts\nthrough Financial Sector Program loan. A key component\nof these strategies is the development of infrastructure of\nthe  village  economy,  which  centers  around  MSEs.\nImproving MSEs access to credit, supported by improved\naccess  to  services  provided  by  business  development\nservice providers, will contribute to growth in employment\nand  income  earning  opportunities  in  this  sector.  The\nProject reflects the ADB poverty reduction strategy.\n\nThe Project's goal is to generate income and employment\nopportunities by expanding the MSE sector by improving\naccess  of  MSEs  to  credit,  and  business  training  and\nadvisory  services.  The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)\nexpand  the  small  business  loans  guarantee  scheme,  (ii)\nsupport a pilot microfinance facility, (iii) enhance business\nadvisory and training services, and (iv) improve the policy\nand \nsmall  business\ndevelopment.\n\nlegislative  environment \n\nfor \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $4.5  million\nequivalent including taxes and contingencies.\n\nADB loan financing is proposed at $3.5 million equivalent\n(78 percent of the total costs). Government financing will\namount to $1.0 million equivalent (22 percent).\n\nThe  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special  Drawing\nRights 2,697,000 ($3.5 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod  of  8  years,  and  an  interest  charge  of  1.0  percent\nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per\nannum thereafter, to be paid semiannually.\n\nADB  will  subscribe  up  to  the  equivalent  of  25  percent  of\nissued  and  paid-up  capital  in  a  Samoan  venture  capital\nfund  (VCF).

The  target  market  for  the  VCF\nwill  be  venture  capital  investments  of  up  to  $100,000.\nProject size is expected to range from roughly $67,000 to\n$400,000  equivalent,  with  a  majority  being  expansion\nprojects. The life of the VCF is proposed at 10 years. Exit\noptions  for  the  VCF  will  be  existing  shareholders  of\ninvestee  companies.  Commercial  financiers  will  provide\ntake-up  when \nthe  specific  business  matures  and\nbecomes bankable under conventional criteria.\n\nThe  Treasury  Department  will  constitute  a  project\nsteering  committee  (PSC)  at  project  start-up,  with  the\nsecretary of finance as the chair. The PSC will establish a\nsubcommittee  to  manage  the  SBDF.  The  PSC  will\nestablish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU),  with  a\nmanager  recruited  from  the  private  sector.

It is expected that\nduring  the  five  years  of  project  implementation,  the\nProject  will  directly  create  an  additional  1,400  direct\nincome and employment opportunities, benefiting at least\n5,600 people.\n\nThe  specified  target  group  for  this  Project  includes  rural\nhouseholds  with  residences  outside  of  urban  Apia,  and\nno  direct  income  stream  from  paid  employment  in  Apia.\nThere are no specific poverty areas or geographic areas\nthat  would  require  priority  support.  The  most  important\ntarget groups in this Project are small entrepreneurs, both\nmale and female, that would like to expand or consolidate\nexisting  businesses  and  require  additional \nfinancial\nresources for this purpose.\n\nThe  Project  will  facilitate  diversification  of  the  financial\nsector  in  Samoa,  logically  extending  policy  dialogue\ninitiated  under  the  Financial  Sector  Program.  Also,  by\nimproving the legal and regulatory environment pertaining\nto  entrepreneurship  development, \nthe  Project  will\nfacilitate private sector-led economic growth.\n\nRisk  areas  for  the  Project  include  continuing  adherence\nof  the  Government  to  public  sector  reforms  and  private\nsector development in the aftermath of the parliamentary\nelections  scheduled  for  the  first  half  of  2001.  More\nspecifically, issues related to customary land reforms may\nprove to be sensitive. Also, while current macroeconomic\nconditions are quite stable, underpinned by robust private\nsector  growth  and  continuing  strong  remittances  from\nabroad, these conditions may deteriorate, either because\nof  the  slower  growth  in  exports,  due  to  market  changes,\nor  decline \nin  remittances.  Samoa  will  always  be\nvulnerable  to  natural  disasters  similar  to  the  devastation\ncaused by the two major cyclones in 1990 and 1991, and\nthe adverse impact of taro leaf blight disease in 1992-94.\nFurther  risks  could  arise  from  the  weak  demand  for  the\ntake  up  of\nSBEC  credit  guarantee  scheme,  slow \ninvestments by the VCF, and unforeseen weakening of IA\n\n\fTechnical Assistance\n\ninstitutional  capacities.  An  additional  risk  is  that  VCF  will\nnot materialize despite all the preparatory work.\n\nThese risks are considered acceptable due to the recent\nrecord  of  the  SBEC  credit  guarantee  scheme,  and\ndemand  assessments  conducted  during \nthe  VCF\nfeasibility study. Risks related to the VCF will be mitigated\nby the fact that any actual investment of ADB in the VCF\nis  contingent  on  IFC  participation,  as  a  lead  investor.\nAlso, continuing strong growth of Samoa's economy will\nunderpin  demand.  The  Project  will  include  mitigating\nmeasures  directed  at  institutional  strengthening  of  the\nIAs.\n\nof \n\nFinancial \n\nADB  will  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity\nBuilding \nand  Business  Advisory\nIntermediaries.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  policy  and\nlegislative  reviews;  (ii) \ninstitutional  strengthening  of\nSBEC,  DBS,  WIBF,  and  other  participating  institutions;\nand (iii) the setting up an upgraded chattels registry and a\nnew  credit  reference  scheme.  Consultants  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants.\n\nis \n\nthe \n\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $575,000  equivalent,  of\nwhich  $365,600 \nforeign  exchange  cost  and\n$209,400  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will\nprovide $365,600 to finance foreign exchange costs, and\n$134,400  equivalent  for  local  currency  costs,  on  a  grant\nbasis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  This  will  cover\nconsulting  services, \ntraining,  and  equipment.  The\nremaining  local  currency  costs  will  be  met  by  the\nGovernment,  through  the  provision  of  office  space  and\nfacilities, and counterpart staff.\n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\n1.\nI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Samoa for the Small Business Development Project; and (ii) a\nproposed  equity  investment  in  a  Samoa  venture  capital  fund.  The  report  also  describes\nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  of  Financial  and  Business  Advisory\nIntermediaries,  and  if  the  proposed  loan  and  equity  investment  are  approved  by  the  Board,  I,\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nDuring  the  1999  Country  Programming  Mission  to  Samoa,  the  Government  requested\nTA  to  develop  a  small  business  development  project  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nfinancing  in  2000.1  ADB  was  to  examine  the  feasibility  of  different  components  for  such  a\nproject,  including  (i)  a  dedicated  credit  line  and/or  guarantee  scheme  for  micro-  and  small-\nenterprises (MSEs); (ii) a pilot microfinance scheme; (iii) capacity building through the provision\nof business advisory services; and (iv) an equity participation in a proposed venture capital fund\n(VCF) being developed with the help of the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF).2 The TA was\nincluded in the 1999 country program, and the TA consulting team commenced work in Samoa\nin March 2000. The ADB Appraisal Mission3 visited Samoa from 31 July to 9 August 2000. The\nproject framework for the proposed Small Business Development Project is in Appendix 1.\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nMacroeconomic Context\n\na.\n\nCountry Background\n\n3.\nSamoa  is  an  archipelago  of  seven  islands  located  in  the  South  Pacific,  approximately\n2,400  kilometers  (km)  northeast  of  New  Zealand.  The  total  population  of  the  country  is\nestimated at 170,000. The average population density is 56 persons per square kilometer (km2),\nalthough a large majority live in the coastal areas of the two main islands of Upolu (72 percent\nof the population) and Savai'i (27 percent). About 35,000 (over 20 percent of the population) live\nin Apia, the capital, on the island of Upolu. Because of the geographically compact nature of the\ncountry and the existence of a good road and shipping network, transport between and within\nislands is relatively easy, and access to Government services is generally good.\n\nSamoa has a total land area of 2,820 km2, with an exclusive economic zone of 98,000\n4.\nkm2, the smallest in the Pacific. About 43 percent of the land area is classified as arable, and\napproximately  75  percent  of  the  population  still  use  land  and  coastal  resources  as  a  main  or\nsupplementary  source  of  income.  However,  Samoa  is  ecologically  fragile  and  vulnerable  to\n\n                                                          \n1 TA 3262-SAM: Small Business Development, for $150,000, approved on 24 September 1999.\n2 SPPF  was  established  in  1990  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  with  additional  funding  from\nAustralia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and IFC. SPPF\u2019s mission is to assist and accelerate the development of\nproductive, self-sustaining, small and medium-sized, private sector entrepreneurs in Pacific island countries. ADB\nalso  supports  SPPF  through  RETA  funds  (TA  5891-REG:  South  Pacific  Project  Facility  II:  Private  Sector\nDevelopment Support, for $300,000, approved on 23 December 1999).\n\n3 The  Mission  comprised  E.  Zhukov,  Financial  Sector  Specialist  and  Mission  Leader;  R.  Clendon,  Sr.  Counsel;  C.\n\nKim, Investment Officer; V.V. Cuong, Financial Analyst; and W. Parr, consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nenvironmental  degradation  and  cyclones.  An  estimated  30  percent  of  agricultural  production\ntakes place in areas with severe soil limitation and the clearing of steeper slopes increases the\nvulnerability to erosion.\n\nb.\n\nPublic Sector/Financial Sector Reforms\n\n5.\nThe  Government  has  been  engaged  in  extensive  public  sector  reforms  since  the  mid-\n1990s.  Recent  reforms  have  emphasized  improving  the  budget,  supporting  the  strategic\nplanning  system,  devolving  some  responsibilities  to  line  agencies,  introducing  performance-\nbased budgeting, and restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Between 1987 and 1996,\n21  SOEs  were  liquidated  or  privatized.  More  recent  reforms  included  privatization  of  Samoa\nBreweries Ltd, Samoa Iron and Steel Ltd, and BOC Gases Ltd. The Government corporatized\nthe Post and Telecommunications Department into Samoa Communications Ltd in July 1999.\n\nWith the ADB-financed Financial Sector Program (FSPL),4 since 1998 the Government\n6.\nhas been introducing far-reaching financial sector reforms. These reforms include (i) removing\nall  credit  ceilings  and  interest  rate  controls  as  of  1  January  1998;  (ii)  phasing  out  the  liquid\nassets  ratio  as  of  September  1999,  (iii)  using  of  auctions  as  the  primary  monetary  policy\ninstrument  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Samoa  (CBS);  (iv)  allowing  commercial  banks  to  make\nforward exchange contracts from mid-1998, and removing a 1 percent levy on foreign exchange\nsales  from  January  1998;  (v)  partially  removing  foreign  exchange  controls  on  current  account\ntransactions;  (vi)  allowing  approved  entities  to  operate  as  foreign  exchange  dealers  effective\nfrom  mid-1999;  (vii)  closing  the  export  financing  facility,  which  provided  funds  for  exporters  at\nsubsidized rates; and (viii) strengthening the capacity of CBS, to manage liquidity and undertake\nprudential supervision, and of the National Provident Fund (NPF) and the Development Bank of\nSamoa (DBS).\n\nc.\n\nRecent Economic Performance and Prospects\n\n7.\nIn  1999,  the  growth  rate  of  the  Samoan  economy  accelerated  to  5.3  percent,  from  3.4\npercent in 1998. This reflected a 7.3 percent expansion in the tertiary sector, which accounted\nfor  56  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP);  a  4.4  percent  expansion  in  the  secondary\nsector,  which  accounted  for  23  percent  of  GDP;  and  a  2.4  percent  expansion  in  the  primary\nsector,  which  accounted  for  21  percent  of  GDP.  Within  the  tertiary  sector,  strong  growth\noccurred in hotels and restaurants (17.8 percent), largely as a result of a 9 percent increase in\ntourist  arrivals  attributable \nto  end  of  the  millennium  celebrations.  Transportation  and\ncommunication, also stimulated in part by tourism growth, increased output by 13 percent; while\ncommerce increased output by 8.4 percent, continuing the steady growth that has made it the\nlargest  sector  of  the  economy  since  1997.  Public  administration  maintained  its  share  of  GDP,\ngrowing  by  5.1  percent,  and  personal  and  other  services  grew  by  4.7  percent.  Within  the\nsecondary  sector,  notable  growth  of  13.4  percent  was  recorded  in  the  construction  sector,  as\nboth  public  and  private  sector  projects  took  output  to  a  record  level.  Food  and  beverage\nmanufacturing declined slightly as a result of temporary closure of the coconut oil mill; but other\nmanufacturing  increased  output  by  1.3  percent  as  the  Yazaki  automotive  assembly  operation\nrecovered  from  the  effects  of  the  Asian  crisis,  and  a  new  garment  factory  began  production.\nWithin  the  primary  sector,  fishing  grew  at  6.1  percent,  compared  with  31.8  percent  in  1998,\nwhile  agriculture  production  was  down  by  1.1  percent.  The  growth  acceleration  was\naccompanied by a drop in the inflation rate to 0.3 percent, from 2.2 percent in 1998. Declining\n\n                                                          \n4 Loan 1608-SAM (SF): Financial Sector Program, for $7.5 million, approved on 19 February 1998.\n\n\f3\n\nlocal  food  prices  more  than  offset  a  rise  in  import  prices  attributable  to  tala  depreciation  and\nhigher prices of Samoa\u2019s major suppliers.\n\n8.\nThe balance of payments remained in overall surplus of ST0.01 million in 1999, with a\ncapital account surplus just exceeding a current account deficit of ST58.3 million (8.1 percent of\nGDP).  The  latter,  more  than  double  the  1998  deficit  despite  tourism  growth  and  a  14  percent\nincrease in private remittances, reflected a 22 percent surge in imports driven by the growth in\ndomestic demand and the one-off import of a Government vessel. Merchandise export earnings\nwere  stagnant  in  aggregate:  although  domestic  export  earnings  rose  10  percent,  reexport\nearnings  fell  from  the  unusually  high  level  of  1998.  Net  foreign  assets  reached  ST183  million,\nproviding  6.3  months  of  import  cover.  The  Government\u2019s  external  debt  declined  to  ST431.2\nmillion at the end of 1999, or 60 percent of GDP; while debt servicing costs as a percentage of\nmerchandise exports reached 17.9 percent.\n\n9.\nGovernment  finance  statistics  show  that,  for  the  fourth  fiscal  year  in  succession,  the\nGovernment  ran  an  overall  budget  surplus  in  1998-99,  equivalent  to  0.3  percent  of  GDP,\nalthough an overall deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP was budgeted. Revenue was slightly below the\noriginal budget estimate because of a shortfall in tax revenue, but the current balance was close\nto  expectations  because  of  below-budget  current  expenditure.  Externally  funded  development\nexpenditure  was  also  below  the  budgeted  level  because  of  delays  in  the  start-up  of  some\nprojects.  As  a  result  of  the  surplus,  the  Government  increased  its  net  deposits  in  the  banking\nsystem,  reinforcing  the  absence  of  crowding  out  pressure  on  the  private  sector.  In  fiscal  year\n1999/2000,  an  overall  deficit  of  3.1  percent  of  GDP  was  budgeted,  to  be  financed  by  external\nborrowing.  Revenue  and  current  expenditure  were  projected  to  rise  by  8.2  percent  and  6.6\npercent leaving a current surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP. Budget outturns for the first half of the\nfiscal  year  were  broadly  in  line  with  budget  estimates.  However,  it  was  questionable  if  above-\nbudget tax revenue collections would continue to offset a shortfall in nontax revenue, and if the\nGovernment  would  be  able  to  achieve  the  targeted  improvement  in  its  net  credit  position  with\nthe banking system.\n\n10.\nBroad money supply (M2) increased by 13 percent in 1999, compared with 5 percent in\n1998. This expansion was entirely attributable to a rise in net domestic assets, with credit to the\nprivate  sector  growing  by  17.6  percent.  Credit  extended  to  public  institutions  increased  by  4.2\npercent;  while  Government  reduced  its  net  credit  position  by  5.8  percent,  partly  to  make\nadvance  payments  on  overseas  debt  to  avoid  possible  year  2000  computer  problems.  All\ncategories of commercial bank loans to the private sector showed significant growth, including\nloans  to  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries.  This  last  development  demonstrated  the  impact  of\nfinancial sector liberalization. Historically, banks were reluctant to lend to the primary sector, not\nonly  because  of  problems  in  obtaining  acceptable  security  for  loans,  but  also  because  direct\ncontrols  on  interest  rates  prevented  the  charging  of  a  sufficient  risk  premium  in  lending  rates.\nWith  the  removal  of  direct  controls  in  the  financial  sector,  loans  to  agriculture,  forestry,  and\nfisheries  have  grown  from  ST1.50  million  in  1997  to  ST4.5  million  in  1999.  The  weighted\naverage  lending  rate  of  commercial  banks  fell  slightly  to  12.6  percent  in  1999,  from  12.8  in\n1998, while the weighted average deposit rate remained at 5.1 percent. The interest rate spread\nthus  declined  to  7.5  percent  in  1999  and  has  remained  at  that  level  in  2000  as  lending  and\ndeposit rates both fell by 0.2 percent.\n\n11.\nIn  the  context  of  ongoing  stability  in  the  macroeconomic  environment,  and  continued\nimprovement  in  the  microeconomic  policy  environment,  an  economic  growth  rate  of  around  4\npercent  is  expected  in  2000.  Allowing  for  the  seasonal  downturn  in  economic  activity  that\ncharacterizes  the  first  quarter  of  the  year,  tourism  remained  robust  early  in  the  year;  and  a\n\n\f4\n\nsubstantial public investment program will stimulate the construction sector. Agriculture is likely\nto continue to depress the aggregate growth outcome by stagnating or declining for the fourth\nyear  in  succession,  underlining  the  importance  of  its  prioritization  in  the  Government\u2019s\nStatement of Economic Strategy 2000\u20132001 (SES).\n\n2.\n\nThe Small Business Sector\n\n12.\nMost of the private sector enterprises in Samoa are MSEs. The Business Activity Survey\nfor  1994,  largely  covering  enterprises  registered  with  NPF,  showed  that  there  are  about  586\nMSEs in Samoa. Formal private sector enterprises (excluding the Yazaki plant) employ a total of\n7,643.  About  80  percent  of  these  enterprises  employ  less  than  20  employees.  A  more  recent\nstudy  commissioned  by  the  Department  of  Trade,  Commerce  and  Industry  (DTCI),  which  also\nincluded  self-employed  people  with  business  licenses,  identified  a  total  of  1,528  businesses,\nwith over 80 percent having 5 employees or less.\n\n13.\nGovernment policies do not differentiate between various sizes of businesses other than\nthrough  the  value  added  goods  and  service  tax  (VAGST)  Act  1998,  which  principally\ndifferentiates on the basis of turnover. The VAGST threshold is currently set at ST52,000. The\nformal  private  sector  characteristics  can  be  determined  in  general  terms  through  various\nsources  of  data  collection,  principally  business  licenses,  VAGST  registrations,  and  NPF\ncontributions.  Over  50  percent  of  all  businesses  operating  in  the  formal  sector  are  owner  or\nfamily operated, with no employees, with a further 39 percent having 5 or less employees.\n\n14.\nThe formal sector is dominated by retail trade activities, with a total of 1,071 businesses\nregistered  for  VAGST  as  of  31  March  2000.  This  represents  a  49.3  percent  increase  over  the\n717  businesses  identified  in  the  1997  Bioglobal  Pacific/DTCI  study.  The  hotel  and  restaurant\ntrade,  at  138  businesses,  recorded  a  40.8  percent  increase  in  the  two  years  following  the\nBioglobal  study.  Substantial  growth  has  occurred  in  fisheries,  with  in  excess  of  400  aluminum\nboats  now  operating  in  the  tuna  industry.  GDP  grew  by  7.0  percent,  at  current  market  prices\nover  the  six  years  from  1994  to  1999,  with  most  of  that  occurring  since  1996.  The  low  entry\ninvestment cost for boats, high returns, and the resolution of issues relating to market access by\nestablishing a number of fish processing plants has led to this prolific growth. The private sector\nclaims the credit for fisheries development. However, because fishing activities are exempt as a\ntaxable income, Inland Revenue does not capture data.\n\n15.\nBecause agricultural producers do not need a license and are exempt from taxation, no\nsubstantive  data  exists  from  which  the  size  and  nature  of  the  informal  MSE  sector  can  be\nestimated.  However,  some  data  sources  can  be  used  to  make  provisional  assumptions.\nNationally,  11.2  percent  of  all  annual  household  income  comes  from  the  sale  of  surplus\nproducts or handicrafts; only 3.3 percent of income from the individual businesses. Although a\npercentage of the population rely heavily on the sale of home-grown or produced items as their\nmajor source of income, the implication here is that generally, Samoans do not regard such sale\nas a business activity, but rather a surplus from subsistence-type lifestyles. Table 1 provides a\nsummary of household income sources.\n\n\f5\n\nTable 1: Sources of Household Income\n\nSource of Income\n\nPaid Employment\nSale of Fish\nSale of Coconuts\nSale of Handicraft\nOther Home-Grown Sales\nMoney from Business\nRemittances\n\u2013Abroad cash or in kind\n\u2013Local, cash or in kind\nPensions in Samoa\nOther Sources\nTotal\nSource: 1998 Household Survey.\n\nValue\n(ST\u2019000)\n\n130,665\n6,421\n5,312\n13,796\n2,035\n8,056\n\n39,699\n12,705\n4,597\n19,634\n242,918\n\n% of Total\n\n53.7\n2.6\n2.2\n5.6\n0.8\n3.3\n\n16.4\n5.2\n1.9\n8.0\n100\n\n16.\nDespite the sale of home grown or produced items not being recognized as a business\nactivity, the survey identifies that on average, a household will grow/produce an excess of about\n68 percent of their household requirements, which is used as either an income supplement or\nas  gifts  for  cultural,  religious,  or  social  obligations.  The  estimated  annual  household  revenue\nfrom items produced/grown and then sold is ST26,624,000, with fish accounting for 27.3 percent\nby  value,  handicrafts  15.6  percent,  and  taamu  and  taro  10.6  percent.  The  household  income\nand expenditure survey estimates that 18,440 are working within the agricultural, planting, and\nfisheries  sector,  with  9,395  in  market-oriented  activities,  and  the  balance  operating  at  a\nsubsistence level.\n\n17.\nComprehensive data is not available to assess the nature of activities undertaken by the\nmicroenterprise sector. The Small Business Enterprise Centre (SBEC) is the only organization\noperating within the definition of the MSE as used for this Project. SBEC has a cross-sectoral\napproach, as opposed to the Women in Business Foundation (WIBF), which has a very specific\nfocus. SBEC has provided a breakdown of its client base (Table 2), which could be used as a\nfair representation of the microenterprise sector.\n\nTable 2: Small Business Enterprises Centre Client Breakdown by Sector\n\nSector\nRetail\nTourism\nManufacturing and Construction\nFarming and On-Farm Activities\nOther Service Industries\nFishing\nHandicraft\nOther\n\nTotal\n\nEstimated Number of\nActive Clients\n108\n48\n24\n24\n12\n12\n8\n4\n240\n\n% of Total\n45\n20\n10\n10\n5\n5\n3\n2\n100\n\n\f6\n\nRecent economic reforms and liberalization have created a new, private sector-oriented\n18.\nclimate, and new opportunities. A new generation of youth is growing up with aspirations other\nthan working on the land. Rural society in Samoa is still in the earliest stage of being affected\nand  mobilized  by  the  new  climate  created  by  macroeconomic  reforms.  The  potential  for\nentrepreneurship development is considerable.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Services\n\nThe main players in the financial sector are three commercial banks, two major nonbank\n19.\nfinancial  institutions\u2014DBS  and  NPF\u2014and  a  small  network  of  about  20  active  credit  unions.\nLoans  for  small  enterprises  are  also  extended  by  a  few  private  finance  companies  and  a  few\ninformal types of financing arrangements. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Samoa)\nis the largest among the commercial banks, followed by the Pacific Commercial Bank, which is\na joint venture between Westpac Banking Corporation and the Bank of Hawaii, and the National\nBank  of  Samoa.  Among  the  nonbank  financial  institutions,  NPF  is  the  dominant  player  in  the\ndomestic credit market (Table 3 illustrates the distribution of financial assets and loans).\n\nTable 3: Total Assets and Loans and Advances\n(as of 31 December 1999, ST million)\n\nTotal Assets\n\nLoans and Advances\n\nInstitutions\nCommercial Banks\n\nANZ Bank (Samoa) Ltd\nPacific Commercial Bank\nNational Bank of Samoa\n\nTotal Commercial Banks\n\nNonbank Financial Institutions\n\nNational Provident Fund\nDevelopment Bank of Samoa\nNational Pacific Insurance\nSamoa Life Assurance\nPublic Trust Office\nHousing Corporation\n\nTotal Nonbank Financial Institutions\n\nTotal\n\n226\n103\n23\n352\n\n175\n59\n22\n22\n9\n13\n300\n\n652\n\n146\n56\n14\n216\n\n108\n53\n0\n11\n7\n12\n191\n\n407\n\nThe three commercial banks comprise only a little more than half of the total loan assets\n20.\nheld by financial institutions generally, the remainder are held by nonbank financial institutions\nsuch  as  NPF,  DBS,  insurance  companies,  and  also  a  largely  invisible,  but  widely  spread,\nsystem of credit unions. Among the three commercial banks, ANZ Bank, as the successor to the\nBank  of  Western  Samoa,  holds  a  dominant  share  in  terms  of  total  assets.  It  is  a  full  service\nuniversal bank catering to the whole range of retail and commercial clients, including customers\nfrom the small enterprise sector. The Pacific Commercial Bank (PCB) focuses primarily on high\nnet worth clients, while the National Bank of Samoa is the smallest and most recent entry into\nthe  Samoan  banking  system,  wholly  owned  by  private  Samoan  individuals,  and  positioned  as\nthe bank catering for indigenous Samoans and clients from the lower retail end of the market.\nThe  National  Bank  of  Samoa  has  a  sizeable  part  of  its  current  portfolio  outstanding  with\n\n\f7\n\n1998\n39.7\n17.4\n13.5\n2.0\n\n6.2\n11.1\n\nSamoan small entrepreneurs. Considerable experience with development loans also rests with\nDBS,  which  is  currently  undergoing  a  restructuring  with  ADB  support  (Table  4  provides  the\nportfolio composition of the financial institutions).\n\nTable 4: Portfolio Composition of the Financial Institutions\n\nComponent\n\nCommercial Banks (%)\n\nBuilding, Construction, Land Purchase\nManufacturing\nTrade1\nAgriculture, Forestry, Fisheries\nTransportation, Storage,\n     Communication\nProfessional and Business Services\nOther Activities\nTotal\n\n1 Including personal loans not classified elsewhere.\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 2000.

At  the  same  time,  while  financial  sector\nreforms  have  increased  opportunities  for  financing  of  small  businesses,  gaps  remain  in  the\nkinds  of  financing  available.  Thus,  commercial  banks  remain  constrained  in  their  ability  to\nprovide  longer-term  debt  financing  to  small  businesses,  due  to  the  short-term  nature  of  their\ndeposit  products.  Without  sources  of  longer-term  funds,  available  liquidity  cannot  be  used  to\nextend  longer-term  maturities.  In  addition,  due  to  the  nature  of  the  land  tenure  system  in\nSamoa, where over 80 percent of the land is customary land held in accordance with Samoan\ncustom  and  usage,  commercial  banks  often  have  a  problem  obtaining  satisfactory  security.\nFurthermore,  venture  capital  financing  of  small  businesses  is  difficult  to  obtain.  While  regional\nsources  of  financing  exist,  such  as  the  Kula  Fund  and  the  Pacific  Islands  Investment  Facility,\nnone cover enterprises of the small size common in Samoa.\n\n22.\nAgainst this background, the basic rationale of proposals to strengthen financial services\nfor small enterprises is to expand the quantity and quality of longer-term debt and equity, and\nassociated  financial  services  to  small  entrepreneurs  with  an  effective  demand  for  these\nservices.  Specifically,  the  concurrent  emergence  of  a  less  regulated  and  more  competitive\nfinancial  sector  environment,  and  the  increasing  demand  for  investment  capital  for  MSEs\nprovide  the  justification  for  a  focused  initiative  in  this  area.  A  more  detailed  review  of  the\nfinancial sector is presented in Appendix 2.\n\n4.\n\nNonfinancial Business Development Services\n\n23.\nSeveral  organizations  are  involved  in  providing  nonfinancial  business  development\nservices  in  Samoa,  including  DTCI,  Samoa  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  Samoa\nManufacturers' and Exporters' Association, SBEC, and WIBF.\n\n24.\nSBEC,  a  major  provider  of  business  advisory  services,  was  established  by  a  deed  of\ntrust in 1994 pursuant to an agreement between the Samoan and New Zealand governments.\n\n\f8\n\nIndependent of the Government, and currently with a staff of 23, SBEC is a major actor in small\nbusiness  promotion  in  Samoa  and  has  a  good  reputation.  Funding  from  New  Zealand  is\npresently  secured  up  to  June  2001,  with  an  annual  aid  budget  of  $636,300  and  around  10\npercent own earnings by SBEC. With its head office in Apia, a recently opened branch office on\nSavai'i, SBEC is presently active on Upolu and Savai'i islands. The SBEC's target clientele are\npotential and existing entrepreneurs throughout Samoa, in urban and rural areas. Target clients\nare  categorized  into  size  categories,  with  the  smallest  (enterprises  with  less  than  ST20,000\ninvestment,  up  to  ST200  daily  turnover,  and  up  to  5  employees)  accounting  for  95  percent  of\nclients. These small enterprises have received services free of charge.\n\n25.\nSBEC  services  are  in  the  fields  of  credit  guarantees,  business  planning,  and\nmanagement-related  and  business  start-up  training  and  consultancies.  The  credit  guarantee\nscheme is implemented through the three commercial banks and DBS. Technically, loans of up\nto  ST20,000  and  up  to  two  years  duration  are  covered  by  a  guarantee  on  the  principal  loan\namount. Guarantees are normally linked to participation in SBEC training and business planning\nprograms. In training, SBEC conducts basic management and business start-up courses such\nInternational  Labour  Organization's  Start  Your  Business  program,  retail  shop\nas \nmanagement,  customer  services  programs,  special  courses  for  established  businesses  in\nfinancial  management  and  marketing,  as  well  as  programs  at  the  request  of  special  groups,\ne.g., action planning and business planning for nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Around\n50  percent  of  small  entrepreneurs  attending  training  programs  become  regular  clients  of\nSBEC's  advisory  services  later  on.  The  SBEC's  advisory  services  presently  have  187  active\nclients.\n\nthe \n\n26. WIBF  was  established  in  1990  as  an  NGO  by  a  group  of  women  who  were  facing\ndifficulties  securing  loans  for  their  economic  activities.  WIBF's  main  objectives  are  to  promote\nand  advocate  women\u2019s  interests  in  business,  to  stimulate  small  business  initiatives,  and  to\nprovide  advisory  and  training  services  for  MSEs  in  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  practice,  WIBF\npromotes microenterprise and income-generating activities by women and their families, mainly\nin  rural  areas  of  Samoa.  From  a  small  start  in  the  early  1990s,  the  organization  has  grown  is\nnow  active  in  81  villages;  16  villages  are  said  to  be  on  a  waiting  list  for  future  activities.  The\norganization  thus  is  an  important  player  in  microenterprise  promotion.  WIBF  maintains  two\noffices, one in Apia and one on Savai'i. It is governed by a board of directors, has an executive\ndirector, and employs five full-time small business trainers, and two technical advisers for bee-\nkeeping  and  oil  extraction.  Six  local  consultants  are  employed  on  an  assignment  basis.\nRegional  craft  experts  have  been  invited  to  teach  or  revive  artisanal  skills.  WIBF  has  secured\nfunding from a variety of sources. The executive director indicated that over the last three years\nthe  organization  has  received  a  total  of  about  $270,000  for  administration,  vehicles,  projects,\ntraining, and loan funds from the Canada Fund, New Zealand Official Development Assistance\n(NZODA),  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  Apart  from  promoting\nincome-generating activities, WIBF is also involved in other fields such as the Junior Achievers\nProgram,  a  forum  on  suicide,  counseling  for  young  unmarried  mothers,  and  the  ECOWOMAN\nmovement  based  in  the  Fiji  Islands.  With  improved  focus,  WIBF  could  probably  develop  and\ncapitalize on its strengths in microenterprise training and advisory services.\n\n5.\n\nKey Constraints\n\n27.\nLack  of  information  on  the  MSE  sector  and  policy  formulation.  The  political\nenvironment is generally supportive of private sector development. While a special and separate\nMSE  promotion  policy  does  not  exist,  there  are  policies  related  to  and  relevant  for  small\ninvestment projects. In general, information on major parameters of businesses in Samoa and\n\n\f9\n\ntheir  problems  and  needs  is  lacking,  in  particular  on  unregistered  informal  sector  activities.\nWhile  data  for  the  formal  sector  of  registered  businesses  indicate  that  around  80  percent  of\nenterprises  have  up  to  5  employees,  no  data  is  available  for  unregistered  businesses  in\nagriculture and fisheries, cottage industries and handicrafts, some microscale trading, and other\nincome-generating activities.\n\nLand tenure. About 80 percent of the land is customary land. With freehold land as the\n28.\nmajor  type  of  collateral  required  by  banks,  the  land  tenure  system  is  a  constraint  in  terms  of\nenterprise  financing.  Related  to  this  is  the  value  of  long-term  land  leases  as  collateral\nsubstitutes.  While  long-term  leasing  of  plots  is  possible  and  common  outside  of  Apia,\nmortgaging  these  leasehold  interests  and  using  them  as  security  for  loans,  is  generally  not\nconsidered permissible or practical at present under existing law. Land tenure is also a factor to\nbe  considered  when  new  premises  are  needed  for  a  business  or  for  expansion  of  agricultural\nproduction.  While  reform  of  the  land  tenure  system  is  necessary  and  would  be  beneficial  for\nbusiness  and  commercial  agriculture  development,  other  considerations,  social  and  cultural,\nneed to be considered.\n\nChattel  mortgages. Because  of  the  unsatisfactory  nature  of  the  registries  recording\n29.\nsecurities  granted  over  personal  property  (i.e.,  chattels),  the  commercial  banks  have  been\nmoving  away  from  the  use  of  chattels  as  collateral,  thereby  reducing  the  options  available  to\nMSEs to obtain lines of credit. Financial institutions identify the Chattels Transfer Act 1975 and\nthe  Companies  Act  1955  as  having  several  unsatisfactory  features  in  this  regard;  both  are\ncurrently being reviewed with a view to major amendment or repeal.\n\nSocial  and  cultural  factors.  Particularly  in  rural  areas,  MSEs  are  operating  in\n30.\nenvironments characterized by traditional village and family authority and leadership, as well as\nhigh financial demands for social and cultural events, strong mechanisms of redistribution within\nextended  family  structures,  and  support  to  churches.  Target  incomes  of  rural  households  are\noften met by a mixture of subsistence production, some wage income, and some remittances of\nfamily members working abroad. Keeping money in the business can be difficult due to social\nreciprocity  and  redistribution  requirements.  This  environment  does  not  necessarily  encourage\nbusiness activity; but rather provides disincentives for entrepreneurship.\n\n31.\nMarkets  and  business  opportunities.  In  a  small  country  with  a  limited  domestic\nmarket, lack of markets and opportunities is a major constraint for enterprise development. The\nsmall enterprise sector can only grow if at the same time new and additional domestic as well as\nexport niche markets are identified and developed. For example, the existence of large Samoan\ncommunities abroad is an opportunity that hasn't been fully exploited. The same is valid for the\ntourist  market  in  Samoa  where  the  possibilities  of  raising  the  tourists\u2019  interest  in  cultural  and\nhandicraft  products  seems  to  be  far  from  fully  exploited.  There  are  other  potential  and  new\nmarkets, e.g., in fishing, organic agriculture, agricultural processing, cut flower production, and\nexports, which provide potential for increased participation of small entrepreneurs.\n\n32.\nEntrepreneurship  and  business  management  capabilities.  Some  of  the  local  social\nand  cultural  factors  tend  to  discourage  rather  than  encourage  entrepreneurship.  At  the  same\ntime,  macroeconomic  reforms  and  liberalization  have  created  a  new,  private  sector-oriented\nclimate, and new opportunities. The young are growing up with aspirations other than working\non the land. However, rural society is still in the earliest stage of being affected and mobilized by\nthe  new  climate  created  by  macroeconomic  reforms.  The  potential  for  entrepreneurship  and\nbusiness development is unexploited. Due to lack of business experience, potential and existing\n\n\f10\n\nMSE  entrepreneurs  lack  entrepreneurial,  marketing,  production,  and  financial  management\nskills and competencies.\n\n33.\nDebt financing. In principle, credit is available for investment funding through products\nsuch  as  small  loans,  personal  loans,  or  term  loans  from  commercial  banks  and  nonbank\nfinancial  institutions  in  all  size  categories  up  to  around  ST500,000.  The  constraints  lie  in  the\nterms at which loans are given: repayment periods and collateral requirements.\n\nCredit  reference  facility.  The  absence  of  a  credit  reference  facility  also  frustrates\n34.\ncommercial  lending  institutions'  processing  of  requests  for  finance  by  these  small  enterprises,\nparticularly  where  third  party  personal  guarantees  form  an  essential  aspect  of  security\narrangements.\n\n35.\nEquity  financing.  Representatives  of  the  Samoa  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry\nand the Samoa Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association, as well as bankers, have repeatedly\nnoted that small enterprises need access to longer-term maturity funding rather than short-term\nloans, and in particular to equity rather than only credit. Equity needs of medium-size business\nmay have been catered to by some regional initiatives, but smaller enterprises have basically no\naccess to venture capital. This is the rationale behind the proposed Samoan VCF; Government,\nprivate  sector,  and  representatives  have  repeatedly  advocated  improved  provision  of  venture\ncapital to Samoan enterprises.\n\n36.\nMicrofinance service providers. The introduction of the Grameen Bank approach with\nloans  exclusively  to  women,  and  through  joint  collateral  and  the  group  mechanism  was  not\nsuccessful  in  Samoa.  Apart  from  the  WIBF,  no  specialized  microfinance  institutions  exist  in\nSamoa.  Along  with  training  and  other  services,  WIBF  provides  some  microfinancing  but  has\nbarely enough capacity to handle the current level of incoming external funding. However, there\nare  institutions  that  provide  financial  services  that  fall  in  the  microfinance  bracket.  A  lack  of\ncapacity among the pilot organizations to account and monitor the lines of credit, coupled with\nrestrictions  imposed  on  the  lending  institutions,  has  prohibited  them  from  offsetting  the  high\nrisks associated with lending to the target group with higher interest rates, and thus limited their\nparticipation in such schemes.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n37.\nThe  Samoan  economy  is  emerging  from  a  process  of  transition,  with  a  more  market-\noriented  environment  now  in  place.  The  Government  has  embarked  on  a  partnership  with  the\nprivate  sector,  with  public  sector  policies  and  programs  increasingly  focusing  on  creating  an\nenabling environment for the private sector. The Government is reinforcing this partnership by\nproviding  funding  to  the  Samoa  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  and  the  Samoa\nManufacturers' and Exporters' Association to purchase professional assistance to prepare policy\nsubmissions for Government consideration.\n\n38.\nThe  Government\u2019s  policies  are  elaborated  in  the  biannual  SES  (para.  11).  The  most\nrecent  SES,  covering  2000-2001  reinforces  the  Government\u2019s  intention  to  achieve  a  more\nequitable  distribution  of  economic  benefits  nationally,  in  particular  to  the  rural  areas  and  the\nvillage  economies.  Consolidation  of  Samoa\u2019s  position  as  a  competitive,  enterprise-based\neconomy will be pursued to ensure sustained economic growth. This growth is to be based on a\nstrong  and  diversified  private  sector.  The  SES  emphasizes  that  the  creation  of  employment\nopportunities  through  village  and  urban-based  enterprises  will  be  essential  to  sustain  growth\nand spread the benefits throughout the economy.\n\n\f11\n\n39.\nIn terms of policies to facilitate private sector-led growth, the Government proposes the\nfollowing measures: (i) improve availability of land for investment and utilize customary land as\ncollateral; (ii) provide a sound financial and business environment conducive to a thriving private\nsector; and (iii) support SBEC to provide assistance and training to small enterprises in urban\nand rural areas.\n\n40.\nMajor reforms relevant to small business development have taken place in the areas of\ntax  and  tariff  reduction  and  simplification,  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector,  removal  of\nincentives, and corporatization or privatization of public sector assets. These reforms are having\na  positive  impact  on  the  economy.  As  part  of  freeing  up  the  economy,  the  Government\nintroduced  a  series  of  policy  initiatives.  Tariffs  on  imported  goods  have  been  streamlined  and\nsimplified, with a smaller range of tariffs of up to 20 percent being imposed. The private sector\nhas responded positively to this move. The company tax was reduced to 29 percent, effective 1\nJanuary  2000,  and  as  a  trade-off  for  the  removal  of  government  incentives  and  tax  relief\nholidays,  accelerated  write-off  of  depreciation  is  possible  for  new  assets.  The  threshold  below\nwhich no personal income tax is deducted was increased from ST8,000 to ST10,000.\n\n41.\nThe Government also liberalized the financial sector, under its Financial Sector Program.\nBanks  have  generally  responded  favorably,  and  are  now  pricing  credit  according  to  the  risk\nprofile of the applicant.\n\n42.\nThe VAGST threshold was increased from ST30,000 to ST52,000, in recognition of the\nhigh  compliance  cost  burden  on  microenterprises  and  difficulties  in  policing,  but  with  higher\npenalties being imposed on those continuing to evade taxes. Business licenses were simplified\nby  the  Business  License  Act  1998.  Inland  Revenue  now  is  the  only  institution  involved  in\nprocessing and issuing licenses. License fees have increased from ST200 to ST300 per annum,\nand  generally  no  distinction  is  made  on  the  size  of  the  business.  Fishing  and  agricultural\nactivities have been exempted from holding a business license or from paying VAGST.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nUnder the NZODA bilateral aid program with Samoa, SBEC has received annual funding\n43.\nof  approximately  ST400,000  for  its  operational  costs  to  cover  the  delivery  of  a  range  of\nsubsidized  or  free-of-fee  training  and  business  advisory  services  to  the  MSE  sector,  with  an\nemphasis  on  rural  sector  businesses  with  an  asset  base  of  less  than  ST20,000.  Funding  is\nsecured through until the 2001/02 fiscal year.\n\n44.\nTo  address  some  of  the  constraints  facing  small  enterprises,  NZODA  also  made  loan\nguarantee scheme available to provide a guarantee for up to 90 percent5 of ST20,000 for a new\nor  expanding  business  venture  that  is  promoted  by  an  SBEC  client.  The  guarantee  facility\ncovers 90 percent of the principal only, and the lenders are required to take the final risk for the\nremaining 10 percent, plus accrued interest charges on any default. The loan scheme is almost\nfully  subscribed,  with  over  50  loans  being  guaranteed  to  date.  The  total  guarantee  fund  is\napproximately ST600,000.\n\n45.\nIn  Samoa,  NZODA  also  promotes  the  Pacific  Islands  Investment  and  Development\nScheme. The scheme provides ST1.8 million annual funding for the region, which includes both\n\n                                                          \n5 Normal  cover  is  up  to  80  percent  for  two  years,  but  with  SBEC's  director  having  the  discretion  to  increase  the\n\nguarantee up to 90 percent.\n\n\f12\n\nthe equity grant and development component. Proposals are submitted three times a year from\nthroughout  the  region  and  are  assessed  by  a  committee.  Most  rounds  are  highly  competitive,\nand therefore only the best proposals from within the region go on to receive funding. NZODA\nalso supports WIBF, by (i) providing annual grants of ST75,000 to help with operational costs,\nand (ii) contributing to the microfinance facility.\n\n46.\nThe Canada Fund has assisted village community microenterprise activities such as the\ndirect microextraction coconut oil process, and honey production projects of WIBF. Funding is\nfor asset purchases, such as vehicles and computers.\n\n47.\nUNDP  implemented  a  $100,000  Microenterprise  Financing  and  Savings  Mobilization\nProject in 1996, initially using the Department of Women's Affairs as the executing agency. The\nproject  was  redirected  to  WIBF  in  1997.  WIBF  is  currently  completing  the  final  report  on  the\nproject, which was completed in December 1999.\n\n48.\nSPPF provides specialist assistance to entrepreneurs to source funding for commercially\nviable  projects,  generally  in  the  ST150,000  plus  range.  However,  in  recognition  of  the  size  of\nprojects  generally  promoted  in  the  Pacific,  SPPF  is  now  assisting  projects  valued  as  low  as\nST100,000.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\n49.\nSeveral  important  lessons  learned  arising  from  ADB-financed  projects  in  Asia  and  the\nPacific are relevant to the proposed Project. First, legal and regulatory reforms should precede\nor  at  least  accompany  direct  project  interventions.  Provision  of  lending  from  development\nfinance  institutions  has  been  less  than  successful.  Innovative  approaches  are  needed  to\nimprove the quality of financial services in the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs).\nProject  interventions  in  the  financial  sector  have  to  be  accompanied  by  reforms  pertaining  to\nland-related  issues.  While  these  reforms  have  proved  to  be  a  challenge,  they  can  not  be\navoided in the long term. An important lesson learned is that funding should be provided only to\ninstitutions  that  are  fully  autonomous  in  their  decision  making  and  management;  have\nidentifiable  performance  indicators;  and  are  accountable  for  their  performance  in  terms  of\nprofitability,  efficiency,  and  risks  reported  under  commercial  financial  management  covenants.\nInstitutional strengthening of participating financial institutions is very important.\n\n50.\nFurthermore,  financial  services  by  themselves  are  not  sufficient  to  facilitate  growth  in\nrural  areas.  Business  advisory  and  training  services  are  important.  Although  agencies  do\nprovide  training  and  business  advice  to  microentrepreneurs,  including  government  agencies,\nbusiness  advisory  centers,  NGOs,  and  business  development  units  of  development  banks,\nthese services are not coordinated.\n\n51.\nIn terms of Samoa, the most successful of the models dealing with access to credit has\nbeen the SBEC Small Business Loans Guarantee Scheme (SBLGS). To date, there have been\nno drawdowns against the guarantee facility despite it operating since 1994. The SBLGS has a\nstrong  link  between  pre  and  post  loan  approval  support,  through  a  combination  of  training,\nbusiness  advice,  and  monitoring.  The  scheme's  strength  is  that  the  lending  institutions\nrecognize it as a guarantee of last resort, and therefore, any client must meet all normal bank\nlending  criteria,  other  than  collateral.  The  banks'  involvement  in  the  approval  and  subsequent\nmonitoring of repayment is a specific strength. The SBEC approach of combining training with\nbusiness advice, mentoring, and a loan guarantee scheme is a model that is working well in the\nPacific, although measures of performance continue to be based more on activities (number of\n\n\f13\n\ntraining  courses  held,  number  of  clients  seen)  rather  than  a  more  qualitative  approach  of\nmeasuring the impact of the project. SBEC emphasizes training, but lacks human resources to\nprovide adequate and regular follow-up of its client base.\n\nSPPF  has  a  good  track  record  with  the  lending  institutions,  providing  them  with  a  full\n52.\nbankable document, covering all aspects of the business, including a full market and technical\nassessment. SPPF involvement in a project lends weight to the banks' favorable consideration\nof the loan request. SBEC feeds larger projects into SPPF and vice versa.\n\n53. WIBF  has  a  unique  holistic  approach  at  the  microenterprise  level,  which  combines\ntechnical  training,  basic  entrepreneurship  training,  and  microfinance.  WIBF  uses  a  project\napproach  (for  example,  honey  production  or  coconut  oil),  and  takes  the  position  of  market\nintermediary,  thereby  resolving  market  access  issues  for  low  production  capacity  individuals.\nThe WIBF microcredit facility is an adaptation of the Grameen Bank model, and incorporates a\nsavings component.\n\nThe microcredit scheme to the poorest of the poor provided by the International Fund for\n54.\nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  in  areas  most  affected  by  the  devastating  cyclones  of  1990\nand  1991,  only  had  limited  success  because  of  the  narrow  focus  of  its  target  group,  which\nimposed a high delivery cost structure on the financial institutions involved: DBS, Samoa Credit\nUnion  League,  and  commercial  banks).  The  commercial  banks  did  not  have  the  distribution\nnetwork to be able to reach the target group, and DBS only achieved modest outreach to this\ngroup. Thus, the participating financial institutions (PFIs) were faced with high delivery costs, a\nnarrow  focus  group,  and  a  capped  interest  rate.  To  qualify  for  access  to  loans,  the  applicant\ncould not have a regular income.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n1.\n\nOperations\n\n55.\nApart from the Financial Sector Program loan (para. 6), ADB has been supporting other\noperations in the financial sector over the last two and a half decades. ADB provided five credit\nlines  to  DBS  in  1975,  1976,  1978,  1981,  and  1984.6  Six  TAs  for  a  total  of  $950,000  were\nprovided  to  strengthen  DBS's  institutional  capacity.  All  five  development  finance  institution\nprojects with DBS were postevaluated. The projects were affected by adverse external events,\nincluding cyclones, economic recession, and fluctuating prices of agricultural goods. Partly as a\nresult of these but also because of internal weaknesses, DBS's operations suffered from large\narrears and unsatisfactory collection. Nevertheless, all ADB loans to DBS were rated as partly\nsuccessful  in  realizing  loan  objectives  due  to  the  high  loan  utilization  rate  and  associated\nsocioeconomic  benefits  from  its  lending  operations,  DBS\u2019s  ability  to  mobilize  sponsors'  funds,\nand its operational flexibility.\n\n                                                          \n6 The  five  lines  of  credit  provided  by  ADB  to  DBS  were  (i)  Loan  218-SAM(SF):  Development Bank of Western\nSamoa,  for  $1.0  million,  approved  on  18  March  1975;  (ii)  Loan  287-SAM(SF):  Second Development Bank of\nWestern Samoa,  for  $3.0  million,  approved  on  16  December  1976;  (iii)  Loan  366-SAM(SF):  Third Development\nBank of Western Samoa,  for  $4.0  million,  approved  on  21  November  1978;  (iv)  Loan  527-SAM(SF):  Fourth\nDevelopment Bank of Western Samoa, for $4.0 million, approved on 29 September 1981; and Loan 707-SAM(SF):\nFifth Development Bank of Western Samoa, for $4.0 million, approved on 15 November 1984.\n\n\f14\n\nSince 1987, ADB has provided five TAs for SOE privatization.7 With ADB assistance, the\n\n56.\nGovernment privatized and/or liquidated 25 SOEs over the last 15 years.\n\n2.\n\nStrategy\n\nADB\u2019s  new  poverty  reduction  strategy8  states  that  enterprise  development  will  be  one\n57.\nway  to  enhance  poverty  reduction.  Enterprise  development  will  likely  be  handled  through\nintermediary  institutions,  themselves  usually  in  the  private  sector.  ADB  will  explore  innovative\napproaches to encourage the private sector to extend financial services and marketing support\nto groups currently excluded. Private operators could be enabled to increase their participation\nin  providing  infrastructure  and  public  services  and  in  projects  targeting  the  poor.  However,\nregulatory  reform  will  need  to  precede  sector-specific  approaches  such  as  privatization,\ncontracting-out, and private-public partnerships. ADB will also seek to influence the quality and\nterms of employment by promoting better corporate governance and responsibility.\n\n58.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  of  assistance  to  Samoa  is  fully  compatible  with  the  Government\u2019s  own\ndevelopment strategy. ADB is supporting the Government\u2019s reform measures, which are aimed\nat  making  the  economy  more  private  enterprise  based  and  competitively  structured.  ADB  will\ncontinue  to  support  public  sector  reform,  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector,  promotion  of\nprivate  sector-led  growth,  corporatization  and  privatization  of  SOEs,  improvement  of  the\nmanagement  of  power  and  urban  infrastructure  facilities,  and  reduction  of  inefficiencies  in\neducation, including the private sector demand-driven development of skills.\n\n59.\nPolicy reforms and market infrastructure will be promoted to encourage the emergence\nof  sustainable  financial  institutions  geared  to  better  serve  the  needs  of  medium,  small,  and\nmicroenterprises.  Sound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets  will  also  be\npromoted,  since  they  are  indispensable  for  providing  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing\nsavings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor\ngrowth.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nThe  Government  has  introduced  a  host  of  successful  reforms  in  the  areas  of\n60.\nmacroeconomic  management,  public  sector  restructuring,  privatization,  and  financial  sector\nliberalization. ADB continues to support9 Government efforts in these areas.\n\nApart  from  supporting  financial  sector  reforms,  policy  dialogue  in  areas  relevant  to  the\n61.\nproposed Project has included issues related to (i) streamlining and updating company law and\ninsolvency law; (ii) streamlining dispute resolution arrangements, (iii) reforming the land law, (iv)\n                                                          \n7 Past ADB assistance for privatization of SOEs as provided under: (i) TA 788-SAM: Rationalization and Privatization\nof Selected Government Corporations and Activities, for $310,000, approved on 5 August 1986; (ii) TA 1062-SAM:\nImplementing Privatization of Selected Government Corporations and Activities,  for  $270,000,  approved  on  10\nNovember  1988;  (iii)  TA  1234-SAM:  Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises,  for  $365,000,  approved  on  28\nNovember  1989;  (iv)  TA  1631-SAM:  Implementation of Privatization Exercise,  for  $320,000,  approved  on  24\nDecember 1991; and (v) Implementation of Privatization Strategy, for $600,000, approved on 7 June 1997.\n\n8 R179-99:  Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\n\nBank, 19 October.\n\n9 TA 2788-SAM: Implementation of Privatisation Strategy, for $600,000, approved on 7 June 1997; TA 2989-SAM:\nInstitutional Strengthening of Government Financial Institutions, for $950,000, approved on 19 February 1998; TA\n2985-SAM: Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy and Planning Capacity,  for  $960,000,  approved  on  2  February\n1998, and TA 3311-SAM, Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy and Planning Capacity (Phase IV), for $690,000,\napproved on 25 November 1999.\n\n\f15\n\nreforming  the  legal  framework  related  to  security  over  moveable  property;  and  (v)  removing\nlegal barriers to competition. Most of these reforms have been endorsed by the private sector\nand are being considered by the Government.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nSince  1996,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  a  process  of  economic  reform  and\n62.\nliberalization that recognizes the private sector as the engine of growth. The reform process has\nresulted  in  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  economic  growth.  The  Government  SES  has\nconsistently  reinforced  the  partnership  between  the  private  sector  and  Government.  After\nfocusing on the major macroeconomic reforms, the Government is now developing strategies to\nbroaden  the  spread  of  benefits  of  economic  growth.  A  key  component  is  the  development  of\ninfrastructure for the village economy, which centers on MSEs.\n\nFinancial sector liberalization, together with the introduction of tax and tariff reforms, has\n63.\ncreated  an  environment  more  supportive  of  enterprise  growth.  The  Government\u2019s  increased\nemphasis  on  more  equitable  distribution  of  economic  benefits  nationally  is  leading  to\nimprovements  in  rural  infrastructure.  However,  barriers  still  exist  that  could  frustrate  economic\ngrowth, particularly at the MSE level. The Project will seek to address these barriers through two\nparallel,  but  integrated  lines  of  activity  aimed  at  improving  access  to  credit  for  MSE  start-up,\nexpansion, and diversification, supported by business development service providers, who will\nbenefit from increased capacity and expansion of their existing services. Eighty-two percent of\nall businesses in Samoa have five or fewer employees.\n\n64.\nThe potential for MSE development is considerable, particularly in the rural environment.\nA  generation  of  youth  is  growing  up  whose  aspirations  are  no  longer  satisfied  by  living  in\nvillages  and  working  on  the  land.  Youth  unemployment  has  emerged  as  a  new  phenomenon.\nWhile  this  is  certainly  somewhat  an  artificial  phenomenon  as  long  as  extended  families  have\nenough  land  available,  it  reflects  social  and  cultural  change  of  Samoan  society  and  changing\naspirations.  Improved  availability  of  financial  and  nonfinancial  business  development  services\nwill  result  in  the  creation  and  expansion  of  MSEs  and  thereby  contribute  to  the  generation  of\nadditional income and employment opportunities. The Project reflects ADB's poverty reduction\nstrategy and private sector development strategies. The Government is committed to forging a\nworking partnership with the private sector; this should be encouraged by ADB.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\n\nObjectives\n\n65.\nConsistent with the Government's strategic objectives and SES, the project goal will be\nto generate income and employment for MSEs. The Project will have two parallel, but integrated\nobjectives for MSEs: (i) growth through improved availability of financial services, and (ii) MSE\ngrowth through improved access to business development support services.\n\n66. While facilitating and diversifying financial intermediation in Samoa, the Project will seek\nto  address  systemic  issues  related  to  faster  market  development,  in  particular  by  fostering  an\nenabling environment for companies and a more fluid land market.\n\n\f16\n\n2.\n\nScope\n\n67.\nThe  following  four  broad  components  are  proposed  for  the  Project:  (i)  expanded  small\nloans guarantee scheme; (ii) pilot microfinance scheme; (iii) enhancement of business advisory\nservices;  and  (iv)  improvements  to  the  policy  and  legislative  environment  for  small  business\ndevelopment. In addition, an equity investment by ADB is proposed for a Samoa VCF.\n\na.\n\nExpanded Small Business Loans Guarantee Scheme\n\n68.\nThe  current  credit  guarantee  scheme,  SBLGS,  administered  by  SBEC,  which  is  now\nalmost fully committed, will be enhanced under the Project to accommodate increasing demand.\nThe  SBLGS  will  be  promoted  and  managed  by  SBEC,  and  be  open  to  DBS  and  the  three\ncommercial  banks.  The  guarantee  fund  will  be  held  by  CBS;  the  funds  will  be  owned  by  the\nGovernment. Interest earned on the principal invested will be reinvested as further capitalization\nof  the  guarantee,  and  should  be  sufficient  to  cover  any  defaults.  SBLGS  operation  and\nindemnity from liability for SBEC will be covered in a memorandum of agreement entered into\nbetween  CBS  and  SBEC.  Individual  guarantees  to  entrepreneurs  will  be  underwritten  by  the\nfunds held in trust by CBS. The director, SBEC will have the delegated authority and discretion\nto offer guarantees up to ST20,000. The guarantee will provide partial guarantee cover on the\nprincipal  sum  only,  for  approved,  commercially  viable  ventures.  Borrowers  will  be  expected  to\nmeet all other normal bank lending criteria. The SBLGS will be available to both clients of SBEC\nand any other participating organizations. Banks will be encouraged to copromote the scheme\nthrough their own client base, and to refer clients to the SBLGS for consideration. SBEC will be\nfunded through the SBDF to provide regular loan and client monitoring and support to clients.\n\n69.\nThe existing scheme, which is almost 100 percent subscribed (up to the level currently\nagreed to by the board of trustees), has an upper limit of ST20,000 per guarantee (80 percent of\nprincipal)  over  two  years.  Recent  demand  for  the  SBLGs,  directly  associated  with  the\npenetration  into  the  rural  sector,  exceeds  supply.  Discussions  with  financial  institutions  has\nidentified that although the scheme is generally well accepted, there is some concern that term\nloans in excess of two years are not covered for the life of the loan. Up to now, no guarantees\nhave  been  called in. The SBLGS will be modified so that guarantees issued will coincide with\nthe loan tenure, up to a maximum of five years.\n\n70.\nA  gap  exists  in  the  market  for  loans  ranging  from  ST20,000-ST50,000,  where\nbusinesses moving into second phase expansion have insufficient security to offer banks, and\nare therefore being restricted in their capacity to expand the business, thus limiting the creation\nof  employment  opportunities.  The  Project  attempts  to  resolve  this  by  making  a  second-tier\nguarantee  available  within  the  ST20,000-ST50,000  range,  specifically  targeting  only  existing\nbusinesses in an expansion and diversification mode, with the loan being covered by guarantee\nfor up to five years. Targeting the existing businesses will reduce the risk factor associated with\nthe  higher  guarantee  level,  as  borrowers  will  need  to  demonstrate  a  proven  track  record  in\nmanaging  an  existing  business  over  a  minimum  time  period  in  order  to  qualify.  In  both  cases,\nthe proposal will need to meet all other normal bank lending criteria, including adequate debt to\nequity  ratio,  working  capital,  and  demonstrated  viability.  Support  for  feasibility  studies  for  the\nlarger projects could be provided by SPPF, given the limited capacity of SBEC to undertake a\nfull feasibility study to the bankable document stage. The director, SBEC will have the delegated\nauthority  and  discretion  to  offer  guarantees  up  to  ST20,000.  Individual  credit  guarantees  in\nexcess of ST20,000 will be submitted to a credit committee to be established within the project\nmanagement unit (PMU) for approval.\n\n\f17\n\nThe  fund  will  be  invested  in  secure  investments  within  the  domestic  financial  markets,\n71.\nwith the interest earned being sufficient to cover any call on the guarantees. The guarantee will\nbe  conditional  on  the  payment  of  an  application  fee  payable  by  the  applicant  on  the  sum\nguaranteed.  Income  earned  from  the  application  fee  will  be  reinvested  into  the  guarantee\nscheme.\n\n72.\nPFIs  will  utilize  their  own  funds  for  lending  covered  under  the  SBLGS.  Final  approval\nresponsibility for applications under this scheme will remain with the PFIs, with clients expecting\nto meet all normal bank lending criteria other than on the issue of collateral. The director, SBEC,\nwill  be  delegated  the  responsibility  for  offering  credit  guarantee  support  on  amounts  up  to\nST20,000.  A  credit  committee,  comprising  the  manager  of  the  PMU,  a  representative  of  the\nTreasury Department, and the director of SBEC, will approve requests for guarantees in excess\nof  this  amount.  Access  to  the  SBLGS  will  be  limited  to  applicants  who  have  an  established\nongoing  relationship  with  SBEC,  and  are  agreeable  to  committing  to  regular  monitoring\nthroughout  the  guarantee  period.  SBEC  will  be  funded  through  the  SBDF  to  provide  regular\nfollow-up and monitoring of entrepreneurs covered under the SBLGS.\n\n73.\nServices to  be provided  through the SBLGS include guarantees of up to 80 percent of\nprincipal with a minimum of ST5,000 and a maximum of ST20,000 with a term commensurate to\nthe term of the loan, at rates determined by the PFIs, with an application fee as determined by\nthe director of SBEC during periodic reviews in consultation with the project steering committee\n(PSC). The PSC delegates authority for approving guarantees up to ST20,000 to the Director.\nThe target group for this service will be both existing and first time MSEs. The SBLGS will also\nprovide  guarantees  of  up  to  80  percent  of  the  principal  within  the  range  of  ST20,000  to\nST50,000 with a maximum repayment term of five years at rates determined by the PFIs, with\nan application fee as determined by the SBEC director during periodic reviews in consultation\nwith the PSC. A credit committee will approve guarantees over ST20,000. The target group for\nthis  service  will  be  enterprises  wanting  to  expand  and  diversify  with  a  proven  track  record  of\nprudent  management  of  their  enterprise.  In  each  case,  the  guarantee  will  be  considered  a\nguarantee of last resort. The following eligibility criteria will apply for the SBLGS:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nGeographic Area. Guarantees can be granted for projects anywhere in Samoa.\n\nPurpose. Guarantees can be issued only for legitimate and commercially viable\nbusiness  purposes  with  no  detrimental  environmental  or  social \nimpact.\nCommercial viability will be determined by SBEC and be revalidated by the PFI\nextending the loan. A commercially viable project should be able to demonstrate\nthe minimum following parameters:\n\n(a) \n\nsensitivity  analysis  of  the  major  project  variables  (normally  income  and\ncosts)  will  demonstrate  that  the  project  has  the  capacity  to  maintain  a\nminimum  of  1.0  x  debt  service  cover  after  a  10  percent  change  in  the\nmajor variables;\n\n(b) \n\nminimum owners equity of 20 percent;\n\n(c) \n\nminimum 10 percent net profit after tax by year two;\n\n(d) \n\nadequate  market  research  to  confirm  the  availability  and  size  of  the\nmarket for the product/service proposed;\n\n\f18\n\n(e) \n\nadequate management skills of the project sponsor; and\n\n(f) \n\nfinancial  projections  are  used \nassumptions.\n\nto \n\nformulate \n\nrealistic  underlying\n\nBorrowers.  Guarantees  can  only  be  issued  to  permanent  residents  of  Samoa.\nApplicants will be screened to ensure that they would not otherwise qualify for a\nbank loan.\n\nSectors. Guarantees can be extended to any sector, subject to periodic reviews\nas directed by the PSC from time to time, based on priority sectors determined\nby the Government in the SES.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nb.\n\nMicrofinance\n\n74.\nCBS  will  set  up  a  revolving  fund  facility  and  contract  its  management  to  DBS.  The\nfacility\u2019s  borrowing  cost  is  estimated  at  6.5  percent  in  tala.  During  the  first  two  years  of  the\nexperimental period, DBS will borrow from the facility and finance the approved projects, which\nhad been prepared by WIBF and/or other participating organizations. The lending rate charged\nto  beneficiaries  is  expected  to  range  from  18-20  percent  per  annum.  WIBF  and  other\nparticipating  organizations  will  get  a  flat  commission  fee  of  5  percent  of  the  principal  for  their\nassistance  (project  identification,  advice,  screening,  appraisal,  and  monitoring  services),  while\nDBS  will  assume  the  credit  risks  of  the  microfinance  portfolio.  At  the  end  of  the  experimental\nperiod,  based  on  the  Project\u2019s  review  mission  conclusion  as  well  as  the  result  of  the  pilot\nprogram,  the  option  to  transfer  the  microfinance  portfolio  from  DBS  to  WIBF  and/or  other\nparticipating organizations will be decided.\n\n75.\nDBS  will  assess  the  participating  organizations,  and  DBS  and  the  participating\norganizations  will  agree  on  a  training  and  capacity  building  program.  Upon  the  completion  of\nthese  training  activities,  the  participating  organizations  will  have  the  capacity,  systems,  and\nskills necessary to directly identify and manage a microfinance portfolio. The proposed training\nprogram  will  be  submitted  to  a  subcommittee  of  the  PSC  for  consideration  for  funding  and\nutilizing the SBDF. Opportunities to include other community-based institutions will be explored\nduring  the  process  of  the  first  two  years  of  the  experimental  period.  The  participating\norganizations should meet the following minimum criteria:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSavings.  The  participating  organizations'  savings  mobilization  scheme  is\ncurrently  operating  and  its  client  base  is  growing  at  least  10  percent  per  year,\nwith the client\u2019s average saving account balance not less than ST50.\n\nManagement.  The  participating  organization  must  have  a  sound  history  of\nmanaging  microfinance  loans  and  savings  products,  and  be  subject  to  annual\nexternal  audits.  At  least  one  management  officer  should  have  trained  or  been\nretrained in a DBS training program under the business advisory service of this\nProject.  Key  project  and  business  advisers  must  have  been  trained  and\naccredited in the DBS program.\n\n(iii) \n\nGeographic  Area.  The  participating  organization  must  have  the  potential  to\ncover  rural  and  urban  areas  nationwide  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  its\nbusiness/strategic plan.\n\n\f19\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)\n\nPurpose.  The  participating  organization  must  have  an  express  purpose  of\nhelping  develop  MSEs,  and  be  capable  of  providing  follow-up,  monitoring,  and\nsupport  activities.  Loans  must  therefore  specifically  focus  on  the  enterprises\u2019\nproductive development, rather than consumption.\n\nAccreditation.  The  participating  organization  must  satisfy  DBS  with  regard  to\nsystems,  management  capacity,  application  of  detailed  operational  procedures\nfor loan application processing, monitoring, and supervision.\n\nLoan. The microfinance facility must approve loans up to ST5,000, with a typical\nloan being in the ST1,000-ST2,000 range for an average period up to 3 years.\n\nPerformance.  The  participating  organization  should  target  to  have  operational\nsustainability  during  the  first  three  years  of  its  operations  and  reach  financial\nsustainability in year seven.\n\nc.\n\nEnhancement of the Business Advisory Services\n\n76.\nThe Project will establish an SBDF, with the fund held by the Government, and invested\nin  investment  instruments.  Management  of  the  SBDF  will  be  through  a  subcommittee  of  the\nPSC,  comprising  Treasury,  DTCI,  and  DBS.  The  capital  of  the  fund  will  be  replenished  on  an\nannual  basis  throughout  the  five-year  life  of  the  project.  The  SBDF  will  purchase  support\nservices and training from participating organizations.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  SBDF  is  to  provide  a  secure  source  of  funding  to  expand  the\n77.\ncapacity  of  NGO  business  development  service  (BDS)  providers  to  deliver  business  training,\nadvice, and monitoring in response to the needs of the MSE sector.\n\nExisting  BDS  providers  have  expanded  their  services  into  the  rural  area,  although\n78.\npenetration and outreach is limited, largely as a result of a lack of resources to meet the needs\nand demands of MSE entrepreneurs. Both WIBF and SBEC have offices operating in Upolu and\nSavai'i, and both undertake regular field trips to monitor clients, provide training (both technical\nand  training),  and  in  the  case  of  WIBF,  manage  a  microfinance  facility.  With  combined\nexperience in excess of 15 years working in the MSE sector, both organizations recognize the\nneed  to  combine  access  to  credit  with  other  nonfinancial  support  services,  if  MSE  enterprises\nare to succeed. However, delivery of services to the rural sector is time consuming and costly,\nand funding is insufficient to meet all the demands.\n\n79.\nThe SBDF will purchase services from SBEC, WIBF, and other accredited POs on a fee\nfor  service  basis,  based  on  agreed  medium-term  work  plans,  with  measurable  performance\nindicators.  Performance  indicators  will  emphasize  outputs  and  outcomes,  rather  than  just\nactivities. Services for funding consideration will include loan monitoring and follow-up of clients\nutilizing  either  the  guarantee  scheme  or  microfinance  facility.  The  BDS  providers  will  be\nexpected  to  recover  a  portion  of  the  total  cost  of  servicing  the  expanded  client  base  through\nfees charged to the client.\n\n80.\nAnnual contracts to training organizations for the provision of training, business advice,\nand mentoring, appropriately justified in relation to needs and demand, provided to a recognized\nstandard,  will  be  funded  through  the  SBDF.  Only  submissions  from  accredited  or  certified\nproviders  will  be  accepted  for  consideration.  Accreditation  or  certification  will  be  handled  by\nSBEC. Contracts will be approved on a competitive bid basis.\n\n\f20\n\n81.\nThe following indicative benchmarks could be used to determine accreditation. (i) proven\ntrack record of professional competency in the delivery of entrepreneurial training or support, (ii)\nprofessional or academic qualifications of staff, and (iii) ability or willingness to bear 10 percent\nof the delivery cost either through their own resources or by a levy on the client base.\n\n82.\nThe  SBDF  will  link  the  activities  of  the  microfinance  facility  and  the  loans  guarantee\nscheme.  Both  organizations  will  use  the  fund  to  identify  opportunities  and  develop  programs\ntargeting the client base, in particular for training, advice, and loan monitoring support (Appendix\n3).\n\nd.\n\nPolicy and Infrastructure Development\n\n83.\nEvaluation, review, and adoption of policy needs for the small business sector will be the\nmain  output  of  this  component.  The  component  will  concentrate  on  the  creation  of  a  better\nenabling environment for small business with an emphasis on reforms to corporate law, land law\n(particularly as it relates to customary land), and chattels. A new credit reference scheme will be\ncovered under this component.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCompany law. The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  overhaul  of\ncompany law being conducted within the Justice Department;\n\nLand law. The Project will seek to build on the recommendations made in a 1999\nUNDP  commissioned \nregistration\nprocedures  for  customary  land  leases,  with  a  view  to  simplifying  these\nprocedures to facilitate the more economic use of customary land.10 A system of\nvaluation will be developed and the use of customary land leases as security will\nbe promoted among financial institutions;\n\nto  existing \n\nincluding \n\nrevisions \n\nreport \n\n(iii)  Chattels registry.  The  registration  of  security  interests  for  personal  property  is\ngenerally recognized as being in need of reform. The amendment or repeal of the\nCompanies  Act  1955  will  hasten  that  reform.  Under  the  Project,  the  Chattels\nTransfer  Act  1975  will  be  reviewed  and  recommendations  made  for  legislative\nand  administrative  amendments.  A  new  computerized  system  for  registration  of\nvehicles charged as security for loans will be introduced, perhaps in conjunction\nwith the ongoing modernization of the police recording system for vehicles.\n\n(iv)  Credit reference facility. The Project will promote establishing a database for a\ncredit  reference  facility;  and  the  systems  and  rules  for  operating  such  a  facility,\nan operational manual is to be produced for the database. A self financing model\nfor  the  proposed  credit  facility  will  be  developed,  and  the  facility  will  be  set  up\nwithin the private sector through the three commercial banks, the DBS, and NPF.\n\n                                                          \n10 This  situation  was  identified  by  the  Government  in  1999  in  considering  the  UNDP  Report  on  Samoa:  Legal  and\nRegulatory Environment for the Corporate Sector to provide a basis for the clear use of customary land leases as\ncollateral  for  borrowings,  particularly  by  the  rural-based  MSEs.  The  Alienation  of  Customary  Land  Act  1965\nprohibits  Samoans  without  a  Matai  title  to  \u201clease  or  licence  any  customary  land  for  agricultural  or  pastoral\npurposes\"  (refer  Section  3  of  the  Act).  Such  a  prohibition  could  inhibit  the  development  of  MSEs  in  agricultural\nprojects.\n\n\fC.\n\nProposed Equity Investment\n\n21\n\n84.\nThe  proposal  for  a  VCF  in  Samoa  arose  as  a  result  of  the  review  of  SPPF  by  the\nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)/Admiralty  Study  on  Pacific  Islands  Financing  Needs\n1998. The study identified some generally available venture capital facilities in the region from\nsources including IFC's Pacific Island Investment Facility, and the Papua New Guinea and Fiji\nIslands-based  Kula  Fund.  However,  the  former  has  a  minimum  investment  limit  of  $100,000\n(approximately  ST300,000),  and  the  latter  also  supports  larger  projects  and  had  until  recently\nconfined itself to Melanesia. Preparatory work to define the modalities of such a fund has been\ndone by SPPF and IFC itself (more details are provided in the Appendix 4).\n\n1.\n\nFacility and Its Management\n\n85.\nThe recommended structure is a 100 percent equity-financed facility, investing by way of\na  range  of  equity  and  quasi-equity  instruments  with  the  preferred  instrument  being  venture\ncapital loans. The internal rate of return for this structure is 8.6 percent, which is below what is\nexpected  in  more  mature  markets,  but  this  is  partly  attributable  to  (i)  very  conservative\nassumptions about the earnings of the typical investee company, (ii) delayed returns while the\ninvestee  overcomes  initial  losses,  and  (iii)  high  provisions  for  losses  on  equity  investments.\nLogically,  a  true  VCF  is  preferably  financed  from  equity.  For  Samoa,  the  proposed  VCF  is\nforecast  to  be  substantially  funding  expansion  projects,  at  a  somewhat  lower  risk  than  true\nventure  capital,  and  therefore  some  level  of  gearing  is  acceptable  and  lower  loan  losses  are\nmore realistic.\n\n86. With  VCF  investments  likely  to  be  primarily  in  established  businesses,  projected  loan\nlosses  should  be  significantly  less  than  might  be  the  case  with  mainly  seed  capital  or  true\nventure  investments.  However,  for  the  purpose  of  the  model,  a  very  conservative  25  percent\nloan loss provision has been allowed for the outstanding portfolio. This produces revenue losses\nfrom  year  1,  which  may  be  too  conservative  an  assumption  when  calculating  internal  rate  of\nreturn, but is a prudent safety factor.\n\n87.\nThe  proposal  is  for  the  VCF  to  invest  $240,000  (ST898,000)  annually  for  seven  years,\nusing total funding of $1,600,000 (ST5,987,000) from shareholders plus retained earnings. The\nprimary  shareholders  have  been  assumed  as  IFC,  ADB,  DBS,  NPF,  and  ANZ,  with  the\ncontributions  from  the  DBS  and  NPF  at  12.5  percent  each,  ADB  at  25  percent,  IFC  at  40\npercent and ANZ 10 percent.\n\n88.\nA  two-tier  structure  of  two  legal  entities  is  proposed:  the  fund  (VCF)  and  a  fund\nmanagement  company  (FMC).  An  FMC  is  being  formed  in  Samoa  and  structured  in  line  with\nother  management  companies  operating  small  funds  elsewhere  in  the  world,  under  IFC\nsupervision. In addition to this and in line with IFC policy on skills and technology transfer and\ncapacity  building  in-country,  this  FMC  is  being  established  with  the  view  to  becoming  a\nstanding-alone  facility  in  the  long  term  and  as  a  vehicle  to  attract  local  Samoan  investors  to\nsupplant  the  original  shareholders  over  time.  The  FMC  will  be  a  special  purpose  vehicle\nnominally  capitalized  by  the  investors  and  subsidized  by  assistance  agencies.  It  will  have  a\nmanagement contract to oversee the VCF. The VCF board members will be appointed pro rata\nto shareholding, with ordinary shares carrying preemptive rights to enable primary sponsors to\nmaintain control of shareholding in the early years. FMC support staff will include three business\nanalysts and an administrative secretary. Two of the analysts are to be seconded for one to two\nyears from the DBS and the Samoa National Provident Fund to learn best practice equity and\nquasi-equity investment and transfer those skills back to their organizations.\n\n\f22\n\n89.\nThe  original  base  case  assumes  that  the  aid  agencies  will  meet  the  cost  of  the  chief\nexecutive  officer's  remuneration  package,  and  other  cash  operating  costs,  for  the  first  three\nyears, and the remuneration package thereafter. A model was prepared, which shows that the\nportfolio size will need to roughly double, to $3.3 million (ST12,349,000), to produce comparable\nreturns if all costs are borne by the VCF. As the structure is under review, these costs and how\nthey  are  to  be  met,  are  not  yet  finalized.  However,  the  Australian  and  New  Zealand\ngovernments have made an agreement in principle on meeting the original base-case operating\ncosts  and  salaries  on  a  50:50  basis  for  the  first  three  years  with  a  review  for  any  additional\nsubsidies.\n\n2.\n\nTarget Market and Investment Instruments\n\n90.\nVCF investments are likely to be primarily in established businesses. The target market\nfor the VCF is venture capital investments of less than $100,000 (ST374,200). Recommended\nlimits are ST50,000-ST250,000 with an upper limit of 50 percent of the total equity (including the\nVCF  contribution)  for  existing  businesses  and  40  percent  for  new  ventures.  Project  size  is\ntherefore expected to range from roughly ST200,000-ST1,200,000 with between 70-80 percent\nlikely  to  be  expansion  or  diversification  projects.  The  investment  focus  will  be  on  projects  that\ncontribute to economic growth and, in particular, earn or save foreign exchange.\n\n91.\nThe  preferred  investment  instrument  will  be  straight  debt  instruments\u2014venture  capital\nloans\u2014because of the relatively small size of the investments, the cost of putting investments in\nplace, and to simplify exit options. While this is the simplest instrument, the VCF will be able to\nuse all other normally accepted equity and quasi-equity instruments subject to well-documented\ncriteria. The financial model is based on the venture loan option, which is likely to be used in the\nmajority of cases. The original base case recommended interest to be 20 percent per annum on\nventure capital loans to reflect the risk involved in unsecured investments. Commercial interest\nrates have been decreasing in Samoa, and the base will be adjusted to better reflect the market.\nOther  income  will  be  earned  from  application  and  establishment  fees,  each  1  percent  of  the\namount invested.\n\n3.\n\nDevelopment Value\n\n92.\nThere is a clear gap in the market for equity and quasi-equity funding for the large group\nof  undercapitalized  businesses.  No  formal  mechanism  exists  for  businesses  to  obtain  venture\ncapital  funding  of  less  than  $100,000  (ST374,200).  This  is  placing  a  severe  constraint  on  the\nability  of  the  Samoan  business  community  to  generate  growth  in  the  economy.  Therefore  the\nVCF  has  the  capacity  to  make  a  substantial  impact  on  desired  growth  sectors  generally,  and\nwith particular emphasis on fishing, tourism, food processing, and manufacturing.\n\n93.\nTotal  investment  by  the  VCF  over  7-8  years  of  $1.7  million-2.7  million  (ST63.5  million-\nST10  million),  at  the  normal  contributions  of  sponsor  equity,  could  have  a  multiplier  effect  by\ncreating up to $10 million (ST37,420,000) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment  would  be  expected  to  create  a  substantial  number  (estimated  minimum  500,  likely\nconsiderably  more)  additional  jobs,  vital  to  an  economy  where  job  creation  is  lagging  well\nbehind other growth projections and is a major policy aim for the Samoan Government.\n\n\f23\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n94.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $4,464,000 equivalent. The cost estimates\nand financing plan are summarized in Table 5 with further details provided in Appendix 5. The\ntotal cost of the Project includes physical and price contingencies. The price contingency rate is\nassumed to be 4 percent of the base cost, while that of physical contingencies is 11 percent.\n\nTable 5: Summary of Project Costs, Equity Investment, and Financing Plan\n($'000)\n\nComponent\nA.

The\nloan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest\ncharge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nThe  Borrower  will  be  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa.  The  Government,  as  a  counterpart\ncontribution, will finance the balance of $964,000 equivalent. The financing plan is summarized\nin Table 5 and details are presented in Appendix 5.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Organization\n\n96.\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project  will  be  the  Treasury  Department.  The  Treasury\nDepartment will constitute a PSC at project start-up, with the financial secretary or nominee as\nthe  chair.  Foundation  members  of  the  PSC  will  comprise  all  current  members  of  the  project\npreparatory  TA  advisory  group,  which  are  representatives  from  Treasury,  DTCI,  CBS,  DBS,\nSBEC, ANZ, PCB, NBS, WIBF, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Samoa Manufacturers' and\n\n\f24\n\nExporters' Association. The PSC will be responsible for the overall guidance and direction of the\nProject  and  will  guide  to  the  PMU  on  coordinating  activities  between  the  various  Project\nimplementing  agencies.  The  PSC  will  meet  once  every  three  months  and  give  directions  on\nproject implementation. The PSC chair will liaise with ADB on all project matters requiring the\nreallocation of project funds (Appendix 6 provides the organization chart).\n\n97.\nThe  PSC  will  establish  a  three-member  subcommittee  to  oversee  the  SBDF.  The\nsubcommittee  will  likely  comprise  three  members  from  within  the  PSC,  who  have  no  potential\nconflict of interest regarding SBDF operation, i.e., representatives of the Treasury Department,\nDTCI,  and  DBS.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  execution  of  the  Project,\nadministration  and  financial  reporting,  coordinating  the  inputs  of  implementing  agencies  (IAs)\nand  TA,  and  providing  secretariat  functions  for  the  PSC  and  its  subcommittees.  Lessons\nlearned  in  Samoa  would  indicate  that  the  limited  capacity  of  Government  departments\nnecessitates  the  contracting  out  of  selective  PMU  functions.  The  PSC  will  tender  out  PMU\nservice  provision  to  the  private  sector,  with  the  Treasury  retaining  management  oversight  and\nPMU  monitoring.  The  PMU  will  need  to  ensure  that  ADB  reporting  requirements  are  satisfied\n(Appendix 7 includes the terms of reference for the PMU manager).\n\n98.\nDBS will be the IA for the onlending of the pilot microfinance component. WIBF will be\nthe  initial  participating  organization  for  the  microfinance  component.  DBS,  with  its  present\nexperience  with  the  IFAD  facility,  will  resume  the  lead  in  managing  the  pilot  microfinance\ncomponent. The revolving fund will  be available for DBS at a lending rate of 6.5 percent. The\nproposal of terms and conditions for funding applications will be stipulated in a memorandum of\nunderstanding signed by CBS and DBS.\n\n99.\nSBEC will be the IA for the expanded SBLGS with the participating organizations being\nthe  three  commercial  banks,  plus  DBS.  The  IAs  to  provide  business  advice,  monitoring,  and\ntraining components, funded by the SBDF, will be accredited participating organizations, initially\nidentified as SBEC and WIBF. TA selection will be based on medium-term work plans submitted\nby  the  participating  organizations,  and  approved  by  PSC  for  funding  under  the  SBDF.  To\nqualify,  the  participating  organizations  must  have  completed  the  institutional  strengthening\nprogram under the SBDF; clarify their target training, and advisory activities for intended clients;\nand estimate their achievable target with the time frame of the proposal. SBEC will follow up on\nproposals  and  report  the  results  to  the  PMU.  Based  on  the  participating  organizations\nproposals,  SBEC  will  develop  a  fund-releasing  plan,  and  submit  it  to  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will\nreport to ADB on fund usage.\n\n100.\nThe participating organizations that intend to use the fund should submit their proposals\nincluding  the  scale  of  the  intended  training  programs  and  curricula  for  MSEs,  outreach  (urban\nand rural) and impact (direct and indirect, income and employment generation) of the program,\ncost-effectiveness  analysis  of  the  training  programs,  and  their  sustainability.  A  verification  and\nimpact analysis will be made of major training activities after two months, and a summary of the\nimpact will be included in periodic reports to ADB.\n\n101. Policy  implementation  will  be  primarily  enacted  through  DTCI,  with  support  from  the\nTreasury  Department,  in  terms  of  the  SES.  The  Justice  Department  will  be  the  IA  for  the\nupgrading  of  the  chattel  registry,  and  a  newly  established  independent  agency  representing\ninterested commercial banks will be the IA for the new credit reference facility. The collation and\nsummaries  of  pertinent  indicators/data  from  various  collection  points  (CBS,  IRD,  NPF,  BDSs,\netc.)  will  initially  be  the  responsibility  of  the  PMU.  Data  will  be  analyzed  and  evaluated  in\naccordance with the agreed monitoring and evaluation performance indicators for the Project as\n\n\f25\n\nset out in the project framework, and refined at project start-up. The database accumulated for\nthese indicators by the PMU will, prior to Project completion, be passed to the MSE policy area,\nproposed to be a function within DTCI.\n\n2.\n\nProject Performance Monitoring\n\n102. ADB will review progress with Project implementation through quarterly progress reports,\nto be submitted by Treasury Department, and regular review missions. The PMU will establish a\nproject monitoring and evaluation system based on the benchmarks and indicators specified in\nthe  project  framework  within  six  months  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  Government  and  ADB  will\ncarry  out  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  of  the  Project  at  the  end  of  the  second  year.  The\nreview will assess the progress and achievements of the Project against its objectives, identify\ndifficulties being encountered, and recommend remedial actions if required.\n\n3.\n\nProject Implementation Schedule\n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  starting  in  January  2001.  Project\n103.\ncompletion  is  expected  in  February  2006.  The  proposed  project  implementation  schedule  is\nsummarized in Appendix 8.\n\n4.\n\nProcurement\n\n104. All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  The\nPMU  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement.  Vehicles,  computer  equipment,  and  other  office\nequipment  will  be  grouped  into  appropriate  packages  to  elicit  advantageous  bids  taking  into\naccount the after-sales services and availability of spare parts. Indicative procurement packages\nare shown in Appendix 9.\n\n5.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n105. A PMU manager will be engaged for the duration of the Project, a systems specialist for\n6 person-months, a small business development expert for up to 5 person-months, and auditors\non an annual basis. Legal experts may be engaged as required to facilitate drafting of various\nagreements  under  the  Project.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Expanded  terms  of  reference  for  the  PMU  manager  and\nmanagement information system consultant are summarized in Appendix 7.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursements\n\n106. An  imprest  account  will  be  established  in  CBS  for  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds.\nThe  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $350,000.  Government\ncontributions to the Project will be maintained in a separate counterpart account. Items eligible\nfor  financing  under  the  imprest  account  are  the  local  currency  expenditures  for  the  following\ncomponents:  (i)  SBLGS,  (ii)  microfinance,  and  (iii)  business  advisory  services.  Statement  of\nexpenditures  procedures  will  be  used  for  the  categories  covered  by  the  imprest  account.  The\nGovernment  will  establish  four  separate  imprest  fund  subsidiary  ledgers.  These  subsidiary\nledgers  will  cover  (i)  Part  A  -  the  SBLGS,  (ii)  Part  B  -  the  SBDF,  (iii)  Part  C  -  the  pilot\nmicrofinance  facility,  and  (iv)  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the  PMU.  The  subsidiary\nledgers  will  be  used  exclusively  to  record  funds  coursed  from  the  imprest  account  for  these\nseparate  purposes,  and  will  be  reconciled  on  a  monthly  basis.  After  the  initial  deposit,  the\n\n\f26\n\naccount  will  be  simultaneously  liquidated  and  replenished  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  that\nsufficient  funds  are  available  for  project  implementation.  For  the  proposed  VCF,  disbursement\nprocedures will be specified in the investment agreement.\n\n7.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n107.\nThe PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Project for the periods ending 31\nMarch,  30  June,  30  September,  and  31  December  of  each  year,  and  submit  them  to  ADB\nthrough the Treasury Department no later than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. The\nreports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will include (i) information on the progress of\nproject implementation, (ii) implementation issues encountered and measures adopted for their\nresolution, and (iii) information on the status of compliance with loan covenants. The reports will\nalso include information on operation and performance of PFIs under the Project. The PMU will\nalso  submit  to  ADB  (i)  brief  monthly  reports  on  project  progress  via  fax  or  e-mail,  and  (ii)  all\nreports prepared by consultants.\n\nThe Government, acting through Treasury, will maintain consistent records and accounts\n108.\nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. Treasury Department\nwill  (i)  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project;  and  (ii)  ensure  that  accounts  and  related\nfinancial statements are audited annually in accordance with international accounting standards\nby  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Accounts  of  the  VCF  will  be  audited  on  an  annual  basis.  The\nPMU  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  in\nEnglish within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The annual audit report will include\nthe audit of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures; and a separate audit\nopinion on the use of the imprest account and procedures. The annual audit of the SBDF by a\nfirm approved by ADB will be undertaken and forwarded to ADB within three months after the\nend  of  the  half-year  and  fiscal  year.  Detailed  quarterly  reports  of  the  financial  position  of  the\nfunds, with itemized income and disbursements, will be sent to ADB every four months, within\none  month  after  period  end.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  prepared  three  months  after\nproject completion.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironment and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n109.\nThe  potential  for  possible  negative  environmental  impact  from  the  Project  was\nexamined,  and  no  significant  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  Existing  BDS  provider  activities\n(SBEC  and  WIBF)  are  governed  by  environmental  policies  promulgated  by  the  various  and\nagencies  with  which  they  work.  Adequate  systems  exist  to  alert  management  of  these  BDS\nproviders  to  possible  environmental  implications  from  projects  proposed  by  their  client  base.\nIntroduction of the environmental assessment guidelines for the SBLGS and microfinance loans\nwill be discussed with participating institutions.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n110.\n\nInitial social analysis was carried out during project preparatory TA (Appendix 10).\n\n111.\nThe  human  development  index  for  females  in  Samoa  is  3  percent  higher  than  that  for\nmales, largely reflecting a higher life expectancy of 67 years, compared with 65 years for males.\nWomen\u2019s status as measured by the human poverty index is the same as men\u2019s. The primary\nand secondary enrolment ratios for females are 94 and 75, respectively; while total and teenage\n\n\f27\n\nfertility rates are relatively low by Pacific standards, at 4.2 and 26. Women constitute 32 percent\nof  the  workforce,  but  only  19  percent  are  in  paid  employment,  although  women  occupy  a\nnumber  of  senior  positions  in  the  public  sector.  There  are  currently  two  women  members  in\nParliament  and  one  female  minister.  In  general,  women  play  a  significant  role  in  community\norganization and management; and distinctions drawn on the basis of gender are relatively less\ncommon  in  Samoa  compared  with  other  Pacific  island  countries.  This  partly  reflects  the  high\nimportance placed on gender issues by the Government. In 1991, the Government established\nthe  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  to  promote  the  advancement  of  the  social  and  economic\nposition  of  Samoan  women;  and  in  1994,  Samoa  endorsed  the  Pacific  Platform  for  Action,\nmaking an international commitment to promoting the advancement of women in practical and\nstrategic areas of development. Despite these favorable circumstances, economic participation\nby  women  is  constrained  by  such  factors  as  limited  access  to  credit.  This  issue  will  be\naddressed under the Project.\n\nH.\n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n112. ADB  will  provide  TA  for  Capacity  Building  of  Financial  and  Business  Advisory\nIntermediaries.  The  TA  will  provide  assistance  to  support  (i)  policy  and  legislative  reviews;  (ii)\ninstitutional strengthening of SBEC, DBS, and WIBF and other participating institutions; and (iii)\nthe  setting  up  an  upgraded  chattels  registry  and  a  new  credit  reference  scheme.  Consultants\nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n\n113.\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $575,000  equivalent,  of  which  $365,600  is  the  foreign\nexchange cost and $209,400 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will provide $365,600 to\nfinance foreign exchange costs, and $134,400 equivalent for local currency costs. The TA will\nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program,  and  will  cover  consulting\nservices,  training,  and  equipment.  The  remaining  local  currency  costs  will  be  met  by  the\nGovernment,  through  the  provision  of  office  space  and  facilities,  and  counterpart  staff.  The\ndetailed cost estimates and terms of reference are provided in Appendix 11.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1.\n\nThe SBLGS and Microfinance Components\n\nFinancial  and  economic  analyses  were  carried  out  for  a  typical  range  of  projects  to  be\n114.\ncovered under the SBGLS, or financed through the microfinance facility, based on an evaluation\nof  the  client  portfolio  of  WIBF  and  SBEC,  and  field  visits  by  the  project  preparatory  TA  team.\nThe  sample  should  be  regarded  as  indicative  only  as  other  sub-borrowers  activities  will  be\nincluded  for  financing  under  the  Project.  The  analyses  were  undertaken  to  ensure  that  those\nsubprojects  considered  most  likely  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  could  generate  sufficient\nincome for subborrowers to repay their loans and generate surplus income.\n\nThe  selected  subprojects  are  diversified  to  reflect  the  Project's  intended  geographic\n115.\ncoverage. Six subprojects have been chosen out of numerous rural finance proposals. Three of\nthe  six  focus  on  agricultural  production,  another  two  are  applicable  for  both  rural  and  urban\nareas,  and  the  sixth  focuses  on  commercial  business  in  rural  areas.  The  financing  scope  of\nthese subprojects ranges from the lowest initial investment of ST2,403 for a cocoa plantation to\nthe  highest  of  ST38,500  for  beach  resort  building  activities.  To  compare  the  subproject,  their\nfinancial plans were transformed into 10-year undertakings. In general, the summary of financial\n\n\f28\n\nanalysis  confirms  potential  demand  for  sustainable  funding  in  rural  areas.  Financial  internal\nrates of return were estimated for selective subprojects with multiyear investments and returns.\nThe subprojects are delivering a range of acceptable returns from 17 percent to 169 percent. (A\nsummary  of  the  financial  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  selected  subprojects  is  available  in  a\nsupplementary appendix).\n\n116. Economic analysis was carried out for the same subprojects as identified for the financial\nanalysis,  and  for  the  same  time  span  assumptions.  For  nontradable  prices,  the  standard\nconversion  factor  of  0.8  was  applied.  The  economic  cost  of  labor  was  estimated  using  an\nappropriate  defined  shadow  rate  for  expensive  family  labor  of  0.85,  which  includes  both\nmanagement and normal labor cost. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated,\nshowing  a  range  from  18  percent  (cattle  fattening)  to  147  percent  (taro  planting).  The  EIRRs\ndemonstrate  the  subprojects'  economic  viability.  The  main  EIRR  increases  for  the  retail\nsubproject  can  be  justified  on  the  basis  of  the  large  import  input  costs  associated  with  this\nproject.\n\n117. A  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  carried  out  to  test  the  financial  viability  of  subprojects.\nProject  sensitivity  was  tested  on  two  variables  (i)  a  10  percent  decrease  in  revenues,  (ii)  a\nsimilar  rate  increase  in  overall  costs,  and  (iii)  the  potential  benefits  delayed  by  one  year.  The\nthree  tested  scenarios  show  that  retail,  taxi,  and  cattle  fattening  subprojects  become  very\nsensitive to the first two assumptions, but all subprojects subsequently have adverse impacts of\nbenefits and revenues being delayed by one year. The taxi subproject could easily be financially\nunsustainable, and cattle fattening turns out to be economically unacceptable in the third tested\nscenario. All subprojects are more susceptible to changes in revenue than cost increases, which\nare characteristic of rural finance activities.\n\n2.\n\nVenture Capital Fund\n\nThe market study estimated some 250 businesses (60 percent of which were identified\n118.\nexisting  businesses)  could  take  advantage  of  venture  capital  investment  funds.  In  a  market  of\nless than 1,000 commercial-sized businesses, this is a substantial percentage. If businesses are\nnot able to undertake the expansion of which they are capable, then the economy as a whole\nexperiences serious commercial loss. A relatively small outlay on the part of the VCF sponsors\ncould make a significant contribution to closing this investment gap.\n\n119.\nTotal investment by the VCF over 7-8 years of $1.2 million-$2.7 million (ST5 million-ST8\nmillion), at the normal contribution of sponsor equity and debt, could have a multiplier effect of\ncreating up to $10 million (ST30 million) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment would be expected to create a substantial number of additional jobs (an estimated\nminimum of 500, likely well in excess of this) vital to an economy where job creation is lagging\nwell behind other growth projections and is a major policy aim for the Samoan Government.\n\n120.\nThe proposed equity investment in the VCF is a logical extension of the policy dialogue\nconducted  under  the  Financial  Sector  Program,  aimed  at  liberalizing  the  financial  sector  and\nincreasing the range of financial instruments and players. ADB investment will play a catalytic\nrole and attract participation from other multilateral and local financial institutions. It will be also\ndemonstrational, and if successful, will create a model for other PDMCs to follow. Setting up of\nthe VCF coupled with the recent liberalization of the financial sector under the Financial Sector\nProgram will facilitate development of capital markets in Samoa.\n\n\f29\n\n3.\n\nNonquantifiable Benefits\n\n121. A  substantial  number  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  Project.  The\ninstitutional strengthening of SBEC and WIBF, along with the establishment of more sustainable\nfunding  arrangements  for  BDS  providers,  will  ensure  improved  access  to  these  services.\nImproving  the  management  skills  and  instilling  a  business-like  discipline  among  entrepreneurs\nwill enhance overall success of the business sector. With the anticipated financial and economic\nbenefits generated within the target group, the standard of living will increase.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n122.\nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  social  impact  on  employment  and  the  rural  village\neconomies. The most important target group in functional terms to benefit from the Project will\nbe  MSE  entrepreneurs  who  require  additional  finance  to  start,  expand,  or  diversify  their\nenterprises. The results of field surveys are included in a supplementary appendix.\n\n123. Within  the  specified  target  groups,  rural  households,  and  in  particular  the  women  of\nthese  households,  residing  away  from  the  urban  areas,  with  no  direct  source  of  household\nincome  derived  from  regular  wages,  will  be  primary  beneficiaries  from  the  financial  and\nsupplemental technical and business training and advice provided through the Project. Project\ncollaboration with WIBF will directly impact on the economic status of these women and young\npeople as part of the more vulnerable subtarget group.\n\n124.\nThe Project will also have specific positive benefits for the people of Savai'i by retaining\na  portion  of  the  SBLGS  specifically  for  enterprises  located  on  Savai'i.  The  BDS  providers\nselected  for  participation  in  the  Project  have  strong  distribution  mechanisms  to  and\nrepresentation on Savai'i.\n\nThe  Government  is  committed  to  achieving  a  more  equitable  spread  of  economic\n125.\nbenefits  from  the  liberalization  and  structural  reforms  that  have  already  been  enacted.  These\nreforms  have  created  a  more  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurial  development.  The\nProject will contribute to the Government objective by improving access of MSE entrepreneurs,\nparticularly  in  the  rural  sector,  to  financial,  business  training,  and  business  advisory  services,\nthus allowing more rural households to develop income-generating activities.\n\n126. Overall, the Project is expected to contribute to poverty reduction by improving access of\nMSE  entrepreneurs  to  credit,  and  business  development  services,  thus  facilitating  income-\ngenerating activities. During the five years of project implementation, without taking into account\nperipheral  effects,  the  Project  is  expected  to  directly  create  an  additional  1,400  income  and\nemployment opportunities, benefiting 5,600 people.\n\nC.\n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n127.\nIn  general,  absolute  poverty  has  not  been  regarded  as  a  problem  in  Samoa.  GDP  per\ncapita is in excess of $1,200. Private remittance flows from Samoans living abroad have been\nsubstantial;  and  the  extended  family  system  has  functioned  as  an  effective  means  of\nredistributing  income.  Samoa\u2019s  human  poverty  index  is  the  fourth  lowest  among  the  PDMCs\nafter  Tonga,  the  Cook  Islands,  and  the  Fiji  Islands.11  The  index  score  of  5.9  reflects  the\nrelatively low percentage of people not expected to survive to the age of 40 (10.3 percent); the\n\n                                                          \n11 UNDP. 1999. Pacific Human Development Report 1999: Creating Opportunities.\n\n\f30\n\nlow illiteracy rate (4.3 percent); the low percentage of people without access to safe water (10\npercent); the fact that all have access to health services; and the relatively high percentage of\nchildren  under  5  years  of  age  who  are  underweight  (17  percent).  A  poverty  analysis  was\nundertaken as part of the UNDP Poverty Strategies Initiative Project in Samoa.12 Studies were\nconducted to assess food poverty, basic needs poverty, and relative poverty. Using a model diet\nformulated by the Department of Health\u2019s Nutrition Center, the food poverty analysis concluded\nthat  48  percent  of  households  did  not  have  sufficient  income  to  meet  their  estimated  food\nrequirements.  Of  these,  the  majority  were  in  the  rural  areas  of  Savai'i,  and  Upolu,  with\nhouseholds  in  the  urban  Apia  area  faring  slightly  better.  The  relative  poverty  analysis  also\nhighlighted  the  rural  areas  of  Samoa  as  being  most  vulnerable  to  poverty,  with  Savai'i  as  the\nregion  of  most  concern.  However,  the  survey  data  were  of  questionable  value  because  of\nsampling problems, and the food poverty line was set unusually high. The Government intends\nto conduct another survey in 2001 to provide reliable data for poverty measurement.\n\n128. Poverty  is  not  mentioned  in  the  SES,  and  no  actions  are  provided  to  reduce  poverty.\nPoverty  is  not  seen,  in  the  absolute  sense,  as  a  critical  issue  in  the  Samoan  context.  At  the\nsame  time,  the  concept  of  relative  poverty  has  applicability.  The  Government  is  seeking  to\nfacilitate broader based, and thus more inclusive, economic growth by implementing its current\neconomic strategy. High priority is given to improving access to education and health services,\nand to revitalizing the agriculture sector. The Government\u2019s rural development program aims to\nimprove infrastructure (power, transport, and communications) throughout the country, thereby\ncreating opportunities for those living in rural areas.\n\n129. Sustainable  improvements  in  livelihoods  will  always  be  threatened  by  Samoa\u2019s\nvulnerability to external economic shocks and natural disasters, over which there is virtually no\ncontrol.  Poverty  and  vulnerability  are  linked  as  the  latter  threatens  the  sustainability  of\nlivelihoods.  The  United  Nation\u2019s  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  has  calculated  a\ncomposite  vulnerability  index  that  placed  Samoa  in  20th  place  among  111  developing\ncountries.13  The  Commonwealth  vulnerability  index  ranks  Samoa  in  the  group  of  countries\ncharacterized  by  high  vulnerability.14  Market-based  economic  diversification  may  reduce  the\nextent  of  aggregate  export  instability,  and  good  economic  management  can  prevent  the\ntranslation of such instability into general macroeconomic instability.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n130. Risk  areas  for  the  project  include  continuing  adherence  of  the  Government  to  public\nsector  reforms  and  private  sector  development  in  the  aftermath  of  the  parliamentary  elections\nscheduled  for  the  first  half  of  2001.  Given  the  broad  consensus  in  Samoa  regarding  the\neconomic policy, current market-oriented policies are likely to be sustained irrespective of what\nGovernment  is  in  place.  At  the  same  time,  land-related  issues  remain  sensitive  in  Samoa,  as\nwell as in many other PDMCs. While the Project calls for reforms related to the economic use of\ncustomary  land,  these  issues  are  unlikely  to  be  fully  resolved  within  five  years  of  project\nimplementation.\n\n                                                          \n12 UNDP. 1997. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Apia.\n13 The  composite  vulnerability  index  is  a  weighted  aggregate  of  openness  as  measured  by  export  dependence,\neconomic  diversification  as  measured  by  the  organization's  diversification  index,  and  susceptibility  to  natural\ndisasters as measured by the proportion of population affected by the disasters during 1970-1996.\n\n14 World  Bank.  2000.  Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy.  Report  of  the  Commonwealth\n\nSecretariat/World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States. Washington, DC.\n\n\f31\n\n131. While  current  macroeconomic  conditions  are  quite  stable,  underpinned  by  the  robust\nprivate  sector  growth,  and  continuing  strong  remittances  from  abroad,  these  conditions  could\ndeteriorate,  either  because  of  the  slower  growth  in  exports,  due  to  the  change  in  market\nsituation,  or  decline  in  remittances.  These  risks  are  considered  acceptable  given  the  latest\npositive developments in the economy. Furthermore, Samoa will always be vulnerable to natural\ndisturbances similar to devastation cause by the two major cyclones in 1990 and 1991, and the\nadverse impact of taro leaf blight disease in 1992-1994.\n\n132. Risks  could  arise from the weak demand for the SBEC credit guarantee scheme, slow\ntake up of investments by the VCF, and unforeseen weakening of institutional capacities of the\nIAs.  These  risks  are  considered  acceptable  due  to  the  recent  record  of  the  SBEC  credit\nguarantee  scheme,  and  demand  assessments  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study  for  the\nVCF.  Continuing  strong  growth  of  Samoa\u2019s  economy  will  underpin  the  demand.  Furthermore,\nthe Project will include mitigating measures directed at institutional strengthening of the IAs.\n\nThe key country risk for external investors appears to be acceptable in view of the stable\n133.\npolitical environment and the fiscally responsible stance of the Samoan Government. The prime\nmarket risk is the small market size, and the relatively undeveloped secondary industry sector.\nFurther risk arises from the importance of expatriate remittances and aid agencies\u2019 contributions\nto the Samoan gross national product (10-20 percent each). However, both contributions have\nbeen  stable  over  time.  Clear  independence  from  Government  intervention  is  also  a  desirable\nstate,  especially  if  Government  institutions  are  represented  among  the  shareholders  and\ndirectors.  Investee  risk  in  small-scale  businesses  is  largely  within  the  management  of  the\nbusiness,  i.e.,  the  management  is  the  risk.  The  main  mitigating  factors  will  be  the  objectivity,\ncompetence, and analytical skills of VCF management and staff, and tight investment criteria to\neliminate the higher risk applicants. Liquidity should be adequate if the shareholders set up and\nfund the VCF as proposed.\n\n134.\nThere  is  a  risk  that  while  preparatory  work  is  being  done,  and  IFC  has  confirmed  its\ncontinued  interest  in  the  VCF,  the  VCF  may  not  materialize.  The  structure  and  shareholding\ncould change in the process of preparatory work. The current indication is that IFC, which does\nnot  need  board  approval  for  the  investment  of  the  proposed  magnitude,  will  make  a  decision\nbefore the end of 2000. Risks will be mitigated by the fact that any actual ADB investment in the\nVCF  is  contingent  on  IFC  participation,  as  the  lead  investor.  ADB  will  continue  close\nconsultations with SPPF and IFC on VCF structure and shareholding.\n\n135.\nThe  participating  organizations,  particularly  at  the  grassroots  level,  have  very  limited\ncapacity  to  support  additional  demands  that  could  arise  as  a  result  of  this  Project.  Unless  the\ninstitutional  strengthening  components  result  in  improved  capacity  and  sustainability  of  the\nparticipating  organizations,  the  implementation  of  all  programs  proposed  for  the  Project  could\nactually  weaken  them.  Grassroot  organizations  are  particularly  susceptible  to  staff  turnover\nbecause of low staff numbers. SBEC, Samoa Credit Union League, and WIBF are particularly\nvulnerable  in  this  area,  and  a  high  staff  attrition  rate  could  affect  their  continued  capacity  to\ncontribute to the Project. This risk area is being addressed through capacity building TA.\n\n\f32\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n136.\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documentation:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nImmediately after commencing the Project, the Government will confirm to ADB\nthe appointment of the members of the PSC and PMU.\n\nThe Government will provide adequate budget, starting with the 2001 budget, for\nits contribution to the Project.\n\nThe Government, either by securing the extension of NZODA\u2019s existing financial\nsupport for the current operational costs of SBEC or through alternative financial\nsources acceptable to ADB, will ensure adequate funding for SBEC\u2019s operations,\nthroughout the life of the Project.\n\nDBS will provide appraisal support training to any participating organization that\nbecomes involved in the microfinance facility.\n\nThe  Government  will  cause  the  Treasury  Department,  acting  through  the  PMU\nand  working  in  conjunction  with  the  PSC  subcommittee,  to  enter  into  a\nmemorandum of agreement, in form and content satisfactory to ADB, with each\naccredited participating organization (the first of which are expected to be SBEC\nand  WIBF)  regarding  SBDF  utilization  by  the  participating  organization  in\nquestion.\n\n(vi) \n\nThe Government will ensure all necessary support is given to the ongoing efforts\nto improve the legal and regulatory environment for the corporate sector:\n\n(a)  With regard to company law reform, the Government will, by no later than\n31  December  2000,  submit  to  Cabinet  a  draft  bill  to  replace  the  existing\nCompanies  Act  1955.

Under  the  Financial  Institutions  Act  of  1996,  CBS  performs  a  normal\nprudential  regulation  role  (including  on-site  inspection  of  the  three  locally  commercial  banks,\nwhich  are  all  locally  incorporated;  is  responsible  for  conducting  monetary  and  exchange  rate\npolicy;  and  manages  part  of  the  country\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Under  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank's (ADB) Financial Sector Program loan (FSPL), CBS is being strengthened.\nImprovements are taking place in management information and accounting systems and CBS\u2019s\nbudgetary  reporting  is  being  strengthened  to  support  key  responsibilities  and  provide  greater\ntransparency. Public sector management reforms, including a corporate plan and performance\nand output-based budgeting are key initiatives for CBS over the next two years.\n\nB.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\n\n2.\nMonitoring and supervision takes place in the Financial Institutions Department of CBS;\nsupervision is currently confined to the commercial banks. The prudential guidelines issued in\nMarch 1996 by CBS are consistent with the Financial Institutions Act 1996 and with standards\nadopted worldwide. Compliance with these guidelines is being monitored by CBS. CBS is also\nstrengthening  monitoring  of  bank  compliance  with  these  guidelines  with  assistance  from  ADB\ntechnical  assistance  (TA).  Compliance  with  core  principles  agreed  by  the  Basle  Committee  of\nSupervisors  (BIS)  is  also  satisfactory.  The  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  as  a  minimum\npercentage  of  risk-weighted  assets  and  other  exposures  has  been  set  at  no  less  than  15\npercent. Tier 1 capital can be no less than 7.5 percent while tier II capital cannot exceed 100\npercent of tier 1 capital.\n\n3.\nCommercial  banks  are  subject  to  a  system  of  detailed  regular  reporting  with  reports\nanalyzed  in  relation  to  prudential  standards  as  detailed  above.  The  two  foreign-owned\ncommercial banks exceed the minimum while the locally owned National Bank of Samoa (NBS)\nhas  a  capital  ratio  of  about  the  minimum.  The  net  open  position  of  banks  is  now  fully\nimplemented with prudential procedures and data monitored on a weekly basis. The prudential\nstatement  on  provisioning  increasing  general  provisions  from  1  to  2  percent  is  proceeding.\nBanks are also permitted to lend an equivalent of no more than 25 percent of capital to any one\nborrower.\n\n4.\nThe NBFIs are not subject to prudential guidelines at present. The FSPL calls for CBS to\nextend its prudential supervision to nonbank financial institutions to better protect the stability of\nthe financial system (requiring amending the legislation). These institutions engaged in banking\nactivities should be subject to the same supervisory and prudential framework as banks, so as\nto ensure a level playing field. Although agreement in principle has been reached to having the\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Samoa  (DBS)  and  the  National  Provident  Fund  (NPF)  report  to  CBS\nunder its prudential supervision requirements, the necessary statutory changes are still awaited\nfor the Financial Institutions Act.\n\nCBS  is  being  reorganized  so  that  departmental  responsibilities  are  more  focused  to  a\n5.\nliberalized  financial  system.  As  part  of  this,  procedures  in  CBS  are  being  strengthened,\nincluding  supervision  procedures  and  strengthening  prudential  matters  including  liquidity\nrequirements  are  being  considered  by  the  Financial  Institutions  Department.  The  capacity  of\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nCBS to conduct banking supervision is currently being enhanced through technical assistance\n(TA)  provided  by  the  FSPL.  Nevertheless  the  Financial  Institutions  Department  is  small,  the\naverage length of experience of its staff is short, and ongoing staff training is needed.\n\nC.\n\nCommercial Banks\n\n6.\nThe assets of the commercial banks comprised 42.4 percent of the ST703 million total\nassets  compared  with  the  40.5  percent  share  of  the  nonbank  financial  institutions  as  of  June\n1999 (Table A2.1). There are three privately owned commercial banks, namely, the ANZ Bank\n(Samoa)  Ltd  (ANZ);  Pacific  Commercial  Bank  Ltd  (PCB),  which  is  jointly  owned  by  Westpac\nBanking Corporation and Bank of Hawaii; and NBS, which is locally owned by private sources.\nTheir  shares  in  total  assets  of  commercial  banks  were  62.8  percent,  28.7  percent,  and  8.5\npercent respectively as of June 1999.\n\nTable A2.1: Total Assets or Liabilities of Major Financial Institutions, 1994-1999\n(in percentage of total assets/liabilities)\n\n1996\n0.4\n21.2\n38.8\n26.5\n10.3\n2.0\n\n1995\n0.5\n20.9\n37.4\n25.6\n10.8\n0.9\n\n1994\n0.5\n21.1\n36.5\n27.1\n9.3\n0.0\n\n Institutions\nTreasury\nCentral Bank of Samoa\nCommercial Banks\n  Australia New Zealand Bank Ltd\n  Pacific Commercial Bank Ltd\n  National Bank of Samoab\n \nNonbank Financial Institutions\n  National Provident Fund\n  Development Bank of Samoa\n  National Pacific Insurance Ltd\n  Samoa Life Assurance Corp.\n  Public Trust Office\n  Housing Corporation\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 1999.

However,  ANZ\u2019s  market  share  has  fallen\nfrom  74  percent  in  1994  indicating  that  there  is  some  competitiveness  in  the  system  and  the\nshares  of  both  PCB  and  NBS  have  risen  over  that  period.  The  size  of  total  assets  of  the\ncommercial  banks  largely  reflects  the  length  of  time  each  bank  has  been  in  existence.  ANZ\nopened in 1959 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the ANZ Banking Group Ltd after the\nGovernment  relinquished  its  25  percent  shareholding  in  1995.  PCB  commenced  operations  in\n1987  as  an  entirely  private  bank,  with  Westpac  Banking  Corporation  and  the  Bank  of  Hawaii\neach  holding  43  percent  equity  stake  and  private  domestic  interests  holding  the  remaining  14\npercent. NBS commenced operation in December 1995 when the Government disposed of its\nentire  shareholding  in  the  former  Post  Office  Savings  Bank  to  local  interests.  The  two  foreign\nbanks  are  mostly  involved  in  trade  financing,  term  financing,  and  letters  of  credit;  almost  all\nlending in Samoa is asset backed.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nANZ has a full branch in Apia, four bank-staffed agencies, one foreign exchange airport\n8.\nagency, and two mobile vans. PCB has a head office, one bank-staffed agency and two foreign\nexchange airport agencies. NBS has a head office, five bank-staffed agencies, and one foreign\nexchange  airport  agency.  As  in  most  other  Pacific  developing  member  countries,  the  urban\nareas are provided with much better banking facilities than the rural areas1 where there is less\nbanking  access  to  banking  facilities  or  services.  In  1999,  there  was  one  branch  or  agency  for\nevery 10,500 people (as measured by the ratio of population to bank branches or agencies).\n\nThe state-owned NBFIs, the National Provident Fund (NPF), DBS, Housing Corporation\n9.\nof  Samoa  (HCS),  Samoa  Life  Insurance  (SLI),  and  Public  Trust  Office  (PTO)  dominate  the\nnonbank  financial  sector\u2019s  assets,  which  accounted  for  93.76  percent  of  the  total  nonbank\nfinancial sector\u2019s assets as of June 1999. NPF, the largest NBFI, holds 23.5 percent of the total\nassets  of  the  financial  system,  almost  as  much  as  the  share  of  ANZ.  NPF  is  a  compulsory\nretirement scheme covering all paid employees in Samoa. DBS accounts for 8.2 percent of total\nassets of the financial system. DBS does not take deposits and is solely funded by Government\nequity and lines of credit provided by international development agencies. The major insurance\nproviders  are  the  Samoan  Life  Assurance  Corporation  and  the  National  Pacific  Insurance\nLimited,  in  which  the  Government  has  a  30  percent  equity  stake.  The  Housing  Corporation  of\nSamoa  provides  small  housing  finance  but  is  a  small  player  in  the  financial  system  with  less\nthan a 2 percent share.\n\n10.\nCommercial  banks  accounted  for  50.8  percent  of  credit  to  the  private  sector  in  June\n1999  compared  with  49.2  percent  provided  by  NBFIs.  The  share  of  credit  provided  by\ncommercial banks to the private sector has increased since the financial sector was liberalized.\nBanks  and  nonbanks  have  minimal  claims  on  the  Government  and  state-owned  enterprises.\nThe  informal  credit  market  in  Samoa  is  very  small.  Money  transfers  are  also  available,  the\nbiggest  providers  being  Xpresstrac,  Western  Union,  and  four  foreign  exchange  dealers  were\napproved  by  CBS  in  October  1999.  Credit  unions  are  an  established  part  of  the  financial\nsystem,  and  provided  by  solicitors  and  moneylenders  provide  small  amounts  of  credit  in  the\ninformal market.\n\n11.\nThe  market  for  deposits  is  dominated  by  the  commercial  banks  particularly  after  the\nestablishment  of  NBS,  which  took  over  the  Post  Office  Savings  Bank.  The  deposit  structure\nwithin  the  banking  system  in  1999  reflected  the  interest  rate  structure;  around  27  percent  of\nfunds were held in short-term deposits (less than 3 months); almost 48 percent of funds were\nheld in deposits with maturities of between 3 and 12 months; 25 percent were held in deposits\nwith  maturities  of  12  to  24  months,  and  little  or  no  funds  were  held  in  maturities  beyond  24\nmonths. This reflected the fact that interest rates remained at 7.5 percent for both 12- and 24-\ndeposits month.\n\nCommercial bank lending is focused on building, construction, and the purchase of land,\n12.\ntogether  with  manufacturing  and  trade.  These  sectors  make  up  nearly  77  percent  of  total\ncommercial bank lending. Whereas nonbanks, primarily DBS and NPF, are the main lenders to\nthe primary industry sector. At present nearly 15 percent of their lending goes to the agriculture\nsector as compared with commercial banks with only 1 percent of their lending. These figures\nare  based  on  tala  amounts,  if  the  number  of  loans  are  considered,  the  percentage  would  be\nmuch higher, particularly for DBS.\n\n                                                          \n1 There are two automated teller machines in downtown Apia and most banking outlets are in the urban areas.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nTable A2.2: Financial Intermediation Statistics, 1994-1999\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n Items\n\n \nMoney Supply (M2)\n Narrow Money (M1)\n Currency Outside Banks\n Demand Deposits\n Quasi Money\n Savings Deposits\n Time Deposits\n\n138.1\n47.20\n16.82\n30.38\n90.88\n18.64\n72.24\n\n168.2\n60.94\n21.60\n39.34\n107.30\n26.02\n81.28\n\n29.5\n12.5\n30.4\n\n0.0\n0.0\n(2.2)\n\n3.6\n21.8\n10.0\n29.3\n\n4.5\n25.3\n12.8\n35.3\n\n Growth of Demand Deposits\n Growth of Time Deposits\n Growth in Private Sector Credit\n \n Currency in percent of GDP\n Demand & Time Deposits in percent of GDP\n Narrow Money in percent of GDP\n Broad Money in percent of GDP\n \n Private Sector Credit (percent of GDP)\n Private Sector Credit (percent of M2)\n Private Sector Credit (percent of total credit)\n \n Currency (per cent of broad money)\n Narrow Money (percent of broad money)\n Quasi Money (percent of broad money)\n Demand Deposits (percent of narrow money)\n Total Domestic Credit/Banking Assets\n \n Currency in circulation per capita\n5.0\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 1999.

Prior to 1998, maximum rates on\nloans  and  overdrafts  were  set  at  12  percent,  minimum  savings  rates  at  3  percent,  and  the\nminimum  rate  on  1  month  to  2-year  term  deposits  ranged  from  4.5  to  7.5  percent.  Since  the\nliberalization, interest rates have not fluctuated significantly, with lending rates averaging around\n12.7  percent  and  deposit  rates  5  percent  (from  January  1998  to  June  1999).  Spreads  to  date\nhave  not  fallen  significantly  reflecting  the  lack  of  competition  and  significant  liquidity  in  the\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\ncommercial  banking  system.  Following  the  removal  of  interest  rate  controls,  quasi  money\nincreased 9.5 percent in 1998 reflecting an increase in time deposits.\n\n15.\nExcess liquidity, which was a feature of the banking system, has declined with financial\nsector  reforms.  The  gap  between  broad  money,  in  percent  of  the  gross  domestic  product\n(GDP),  which  shows  the  amount  of  liquidity  available  and  private  credit  in  percent  of  GDP,\nprovides a rough indication in Samoa of the excess liquidity in the system. This measurement\nhas fallen from 13 percent in 1994 to just under 7 percent in 1998 and an estimated 5 percent in\n1999,  indicating  that  excess  liquidity  has  declined  considerably  over  that  period.  However\nliquidity  in  the  market  is  affected  by  the  actions  of  both  NPF  and  ACS.  ACS  has  recently\nconstructed a new building and has built up large term deposits in the banking system. Now it is\npaying builders, it is withdrawing these deposits, and much of the funds are going overseas.\n\nD.\n\nNonbank Financial Institutions\n\n1. \n\nNational Provident Fund\n\n16.\nNPF  was  established  under  the  NPF  Act  of  1972.  The  act  does  not  include  specific\nguidelinesm, but places NPF board in the position of trustee. The board has interpreted this to\nmean that they should be ultra cautious in their investments. Their major investment areas are\n(i) property loans (residential and commercial); (ii) members loans (e.g., housing, school fees);\nand (iii) freehold property loans. However in December 1998, several amendments to the NPF\nAct were passed by Parliament, including: (i) that members\u2019 interests are to be paramount in the\nadministration of the fund; (ii) the fund can now invest up to 10 percent of its investment funds\noverseas, and invest for terms longer than 12 months without prior approval of the minister of\nfinance;  and  (iii)  an  amendment  to  allow  members  to  withdraw  their  account  balance  at\nretirement in one lump sum from age 55, as well as allowing withdrawal prior to this age under\ncertain circumstances.\n\n17.\nNPF has about 25,000 active members (members who have made a contribution in the\nlast  30  days)  out  of  a  potential  workforce  of  50,000-60,000.  Members  and  their  employers\ncontribute 5 percent of salary. At age 55, members can take either a lump sum or a pension.\nUntil  December  1998  they  could  only  take  a  pension.  Now  virtually  everybody  takes  the  lump\nsum. The reason for offering a lump sum was (i) the pension was very small as most members\nhad  balances  between  ST10-ST30,000,  and  (ii)  the  members  wanted  a  lump  sum  to  start  a\nsmall business; however there is no evidence that the lump sum is being used for this purpose.\n\n18.\nLess than 5 percent of NPF\u2019s investments are in equity. This is so small because there\nis  no  secondary  market  and  no  price  transparency.  NPF  currently  has  investments  in  two\ncompanies,  both  of  which  were  recommended  by  South  Pacific  Project  Facility  (SPPF).  At\npresent,  equity  investment  in  NPF,  are  essentially  locked  in.  As  of  December  1997,\ncontributions to the fund stood at ST107 million, with a growth over the previous year of some\nST11  million.  Although  NPF  recently  obtained  permission  to  invest  up  to  10  percent  of  its\nportfolio  overseas,  no  foreign  investments  have  been  made.  ANZ  has  been  trying  to  set  up  a\nregional  meeting  in  Melbourne  so  that  provident  funds  in  the  region  can  work  together  to\nestablish an overseas fund.\n\nThe strengthening of NPF has been part of financial sector reforms in Samoa. As part of\n19.\nthese reforms, NPF has undertaken a major reorganization and continued its strong growth, a\ncorporate plan has been developed, and an actuarial review is now ongoing. NPF has moved to\nimplement  a  market-based  interest  rate  policy  for  loans  to  its  members.  Prior  to  the  reforms\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 2, page 6\n\nNPF charged 9 percent for all loans regardless of risk; it has now adopted a base rate of 10.5\npercent  with  risk-weighted  margins  of  up  to  6  percent;  a  matrix  of  risk  factors  has  been\ndeveloped together with guidelines for their application. The average interest rate for NPF loans\nis  now  between  12  to  13  percent  per  annum,  and  is  comparable  with  rates  being  charged  in\nother financial institutions.\n\n2.\n\nDevelopment Bank of Samoa\n\nSince its establishment in 1974, DBS has relied almost exclusively on soft loans from aid\n20.\nagencies  such  as  ADB,  and  the  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB),  together  with  funding  from\nthe  Government  of  Samoa  as  its  main  sources  of  capital  and  finance.  In  general  this  is\nconsistent with how all development banks throughout the region have raised capital. Farmers,\nfisherfolk, and business people in the rural areas have very limited access to credit and banking\nservices.  Often  they  depend  on  informal  sources  of  credit  at  high  cost.  Rural  borrowers  are\nhampered by lack of collateral, little or no equity, very few business skills, and inadequacies in\nproject  ideas.  Private  commercial  banks  do  not  have  branches  in  the  rural  areas  and  their\nlending to rural-based borrowers is minimal\u2014approximately 1 percent of their lending according\nto the most recent CBS figures. In this environment, DBS has played a crucial role in assisting\nborrowers in these areas in the development of their businesses.\n\nAgriculture has been the major focus of lending for DBS in both 1997 and 1998, and it is\n21.\nexpected to remain a major focus of DBS lending. Within this sector, fishing has been the major\ngrowth area. Fisheries has enjoyed very buoyant times in recent years and DBS has had major\nexposure to the industry, with the growth of new entrants impressive. However, many may not\nsurvive due to the stricter licensing requirements recently brought down by Government.\n\n22.\nUnder the reform program, DBS moved to a policy of fully market-based interest rates in\nJanuary 1998. It has eliminated the concessionary rates for agriculture (formerly 8 percent per\nannum),  and  has  established  a  risk  matrix  and  guidelines  for  assigning  risk  weightings  to\ninterest rates, with a base rate of 10.5 percent and a range of up to 13.5 percent. Average rates\nare now equivalent to open market rates and have been budgeted between 12 and 13 percent.\nIn addition, small loans have been more appropriately priced by adopting flat rates of 10 percent\nminimum for this class of loan (equivalent to around 18 percent per annum) to reflect the high\nappraisal and administrative cost of the loans.\n\nDBS has performed consistently over the last few years. With various ADB TA, DBS has\n\n23.\naddressed most of its key operational areas.\n\n24.\nDBS's  strategic  plan  was  approved  by  its  board  in  December  1998.  The  plan's  major\nfocus  to  streamline  loan-processing  procedures  and  strengthen  the  recovery  of  bad  loans  by\nestablishing  a  loan  recovery  unit.  DBS  has  also  made  significant  progress  international  best\npractice of its credit policies and procedures, and has established board-approved credit policy\nguidelines.  The  identification  and  establishment  of  a  range  of  performance  indicators  has\nprovided  management  and  the  board  with  the  means  of  monitoring  performance  in  the  critical\nareas  of  DBS  operations.  The  performance  indicators  and  targets  over  the  planning  period\nreflected in the financial and other objectives were developed as part of the corporate plan and\ntaking  into  account  other  development  banks  in  the  region  as  well  as  attempting  some  best\npractice principles.\n\nE.\n\nMicrofinance\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 2, page 7\n\n1.\n\nDemand for Microfinance in Samoa\n\n25.\nThe  growth  in  demand  for  microfinance  services,  especially  for  informal  financial\nservices is an indication of the unmet demand for financial services, especially by low-income\nhouseholds  and  people  in  rural  areas  who  have  limited  access  to  formal  financial  services.\nDemand for microfinance services is increasing in Samoa as a result of vulnerability to poverty,\nunemployment  and  the  burgeoning  informal  sector,  and  lack  of  access  by  the  poor  to  formal\nfinancial services.\n\n26.\nIn  Samoa,  as  in  many  countries  in  the  Pacific,  poverty  remains  a  sensitive  issue.  It  is\nbelieved that one never goes without in Samoa because of the fa\u2019asamoa, which is a kind of a\nsafety  net  that  protects  and  provides  for  all  members  of  an  extended  network  of  family  and\nfriends. However, this support system is now being threatened by the transition from traditional\nto  modern  society.  Evidence  indicates  that  social  systems  are  being  undermined  in  these\ntransitional  times  as  seen  by  increased  crime  rates,  rising  incidence  of  family  disputes  and\nmarriage  breakups,  and  emergence  of  relative  poverty.  The  1998  Samoa  household  income\nand expenditure survey found that one in three households could not properly meet their basic\nneeds and, therefore, were poor relative to standards of living in Samoa.\n\n27.\nUnemployment is on the rise in Samoa. Private sector employment has been in decline\nfalling  by  0.56  percent  and  1.26  percent  in  1997  and  1998  respectively  (Data  from  National\nProvident Fund). The situation in not likely to improve over the foreseeable future. The waged\nsector will not expand at a sufficient rate to provide jobs to meet present demands of the more\nthan 4,000 annual school leavers, and those that will be affected by reforms in the public sector.\nThe  people  in  informal  employment  increased  from  27,400  in  1986  to  29,000  in  1991;  while\nthose working in the formal sector were 45,500 in 1986 increasing to 47,900 in 1991. Estimates\nare that the urban informal market has grown by around 10 percent annually, and involves 500-\n600 households. Women, in particularly, are more actively involved in informal sector activities\nto  augment  the  family  income.  Approximately  90  percent  of  women  traders  at  the  food,\nhandicraft, and flea markets are women.\n\n2.\n\nSupply of Microfinance\n\nThe \n\nin  Samoa \n\nfew  providers  of  microfinance  services \n\n28.\ninclude  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), credit unions, DBS, or commercial banks. Only one NGO, the Women in\nBusiness  Foundation  (WIBF),  is  involved  in  microfinance;  it  is  implementing  a  microfinance\nscheme with funding provided by UNDP but on a very limited scale. Other NGOs have already\nsignified interest in microfinance, but there is no legal framework allowing NGOs to engage in\nmicrofinance.  The  current  laws  are  silent  on  whether  NGOs  can  provide  credit  and  accept\nsavings. NGOs, including WIBF, need institutional strengthening, in terms of TA and training, to\nbe  able  to  effectively  expand  their  outreach  and  to  achieve  operational  self-sufficiency  in  the\ndistant future.\n\n29.\nThe longstanding providers of microfinance services in Samoa are the credit unions who\noffer  both  savings  facilities  and  credit.  Credit  unions  have  provided  substantial  loans  to  their\nmembers  and  have  mobilized  a  significant  amount  of  savings  from  members;  some  of  them\nearn  income  from  their  operations,  especially  those  whose  office  bearers  are  extending\nvoluntary services, because of the very low operational costs.\n\n30.\nThe DBS also provides small loans but its loans are subject to the usual lending polices\nof the DBS making it difficult for low-income people to have access to their loans. Commercial\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 2, page 8\n\nbanks  and  finance  companies  also  provide  financial  services  but  cater  to  those  gainfully\nemployed or with regular sources of income. Some of the requirements and the relatively high\namount of the loan make it difficult for microentrepreneurs and low-income households to have\naccess  to  their  services.  Their  services  are  also  quite  expensive  considering  the  various  fees\ncharged to clients.\n\n31.\nSubstantial  financial  transactions  (credit  and  savings)  are  likely  flowing  in  the  informal\nfinancial  system  in  Samoa.  However  the  savings  and  loans  are  mainly  used  for  meeting\ntraditional and family obligations and rarely utilized for productive purposes or enterprises. The\nsources of credit and savings for the marginal sector of society come from the informal financial\nsystem, semiformal financial system, and formal financial system.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FUND\n\nA.\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of the Small Business Development Fund (SBDF) is to provide sustainable\n1. \nfunding  for  business  development  activities  directed  at  the  micro-  and  small-enterprise  (MSE)\nsector,  with  an  emphasis  on  rural  enterprises.  The  SBDF  will  be  used  to  purchase  business\ntraining, advisory, and monitoring services from accredited business service providers working\nclosely  with  the  target  groups,  in  support  of  other  project  components.  Accredited  business\nservice providers are initially identified as the Women in Business Foundation (WIBF) and the\nSmall  Business  Enterprise  Centre  (SBEC).  SBEC  will  be  responsible \nfor  confirming\naccreditation of other potential participating organizations.\n\nB.\n\nFunding Base\n\nC.\n\nStructure\n\n2. \nThe  SBDF  will  be  financed  initially  through  a  $0.8  million  grant  to  be  made  from  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  loan  account.  The  potential  exists  for  any  balance  remaining  in  the\nSBDF  to  be  converted  to  a  trust  fund  toward  the  end  of  the  five-year  project  lifespan.  Initial\nexpressions  of  interest  in  this  regard  came  from  the  New  Zealand  Overseas  Development\nAssistance (NZODA) and the Government of Samoa.\n\n3. \nThe SBDF will be held in a specially designated escrow account with the Central Bank of\nSamoa (CBS). The SBDF will be managed by a subcommittee of the project steering committee\n(PSC),  comprising  one  representative  each  from  the  Treasury  Department,  the  Department  of\nTrade,  Commerce,  and  Industry  (DTCI);  and  the  Development  Bank  of  Samoa  (DBS).  It  is\nproposed that the financial secretary or nominee, on behalf of the Government and the Treasury\ninterests  could  be\nthe  subcommittee.  Other  development  partners \nDepartment,  chair \nrepresented on the subcommittee if necessary. Details of the main workings of the SBDF will be\ndocumented in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Treasury Department and\nCBS, the MOU to be in form and content acceptable to ADB.\n\nParticipating organizations and implementing agencies who are likely to benefit from the\n\n4. \nSBDF will be excluded from serving on the subcommittee to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\nD.\n\nFunctions\n\nE.\n\nIncome\n\nThe \n\nfunctions  of \n\nthe  subcommittee  will \n\n5. \ninclude  (i)  operation,  supervision  and\nmanagement  of  the  SBDF,  (ii)  investment  and  distribution  of  the  SBDF  resources,  and  (iii)\nauthorization and conclusion of agreements on behalf of the PSC. The subcommittee will meet\nat  least  biannually  to  consider  work  plans  and  funding  requests  from  accredited  service\nproviders,  and  quarterly  to  receive  monitoring  reports  and  approve  quarterly  advances  to\nparticipating organizations.\n\n6. \nUnder  the  Project  it  is  envisioned  that  the  SBDF  will  be  annually  replenished  by  the\nGovernment from its budget, and by ADB loan proceeds to the amounts specified in Table A4.2.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nF.\n\nDistribution of Income\n\n7. \nSBEC and WIBF are to be invited to submit fully costed and detailed medium-term work\nplans  annually  for  funding  consideration.  Proposals  must  demonstrate  how  the  funding  of\nactivities  will  enhance  the  prospects  for  achieving  the  project  goal  of  increasing  income  and\nemployment  in  the  MSE  sector,  emphasizing  the  rural  sector.  The  SBDF  will  initially  support\nWIBF  and  SBEC,  but  could  expand  its  support  to  other  participating  organizations  as  they\nbecome accredited.\n\nProposals  must  demonstrate  a  clear  separation  between  the  activities  currently  funded\n\n8. \nunder other aid activities, and those proposed to be funded under the SBDF.\n\n9. \nProposals  must  demonstrate  a  clear  demand  for  the  proposed  activities.  While  the\nproposals will likely not be fully funded through the SBDF, a portion of the total cost will be paid\nfor either through a contribution from the participating organizations, or through the charging of\na levy on the target group.\n\nProposals  will  be  considered  on  a  competitive  bid  basis,  and  the  SBDF  can  accept  or\n\n10. \nreject any or all proposals. The decision of the subcommittee will be final.\n\n11.  Work plans must include detailed performance measures, which will form the basis of a\ncontract between the SBDF and the participating organization concerned. Contracts will be on a\nfixed fee basis, and clearly linked to outputs.\n\n12. \nAdequate monitoring mechanisms and systems must be put in place by the participating\norganizations  to  provide  an  audit  trail  and  monitoring  of  the  activities,  outputs,  and  impact  of\nprograms funded out of the SBDF.\n\n13. \nIn  recognition  of  the  funding  constraints  experienced  by  participating  organizations,\nquarterly  advance  payments  may  be  made  against  the  contract  to  the  commonly  participating\norganization concerned. The payment of quarterly advances will be conditional on achieving the\nmilestones agreed to for the prior quarter, and will be based both on project performance and\nfinancial audits.\n\nG.\n\nOperation and Administration\n\n14. \nThe project monitoring unit (PMU) will provide administration support for the SBDF, in a\nmanner acceptable to ADB. Administration would consist of maintaining the books of account,\nmaintaining the bank accounts, evaluating and summarizing proposals for consideration by the\nsub-committee,  receiving  income,  negotiating  contracts,  making  payments,  and  preparing\nfinancial and other operational statements.\n\n15.  Monitoring the activities of the participating organizations contracted to deliver services\nwill  be  undertaken  by  the  PMU,  with  summary  reports  presented  to  the  subcommittee  of  the\nPSC on a quarterly basis. Progress reports by the POs will form part of the contract agreed to\nby the parties.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 3, page 3\n\nH.\n\nAudit\n\n16. \nA  reputable  auditing  company,  domiciled  in  Samoa,  will  audit  the  SBDF  on  an  annual\nbasis.  Major  responsibilities  of  the  auditors  will  include  confirmation  that  the  investments  are\nheld in the designated bank account, that all income has been received, that all payments have\nbeen  properly  authorized  and  recorded,  that  bank  accounts  have  been  verified,  and  that  all\nfinancial information presented to the subcommittee is accurate.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 4, page 1\n\nSAMOA VENTURE CAPITAL FUND\n\nA.\n\nBackground\n\n1.\nThe proposal for a venture capital facility (VCF) in Samoa arose as a result of the South\nPacific  Project  Facility  (SPPF)  aid  review  undertaken  in  November  1998  of  the  International\nFinance Corporation (IFC)/Admiralty Study on Pacific Islands Financing Needs 1998. The study\nidentified  some  generally  available  VCFs  in  the  region  from  sources  including  Pacific  Island\nInvestment  Facility  (PIIF)  (IFC),  and  the  Papua  New  Guinea/Fiji  Islands  based  Kula  Fund.\nHowever, the former has a minimum investment limit of $100,000, and the latter also supports\nlarger projects and had until recently confined itself to Melanesia. Other funding sources such\nas  New  Zealand\u2019s  Pacific  Island  Investment  Development  Scheme  (PIIDS)  have  constraints\nrelating to participation by aid country nationals.\n\n2.\nA  clear  gap  exists  for  financing  below  ST300,000  for  locally  based  projects.  In\nconsultation with SPPF, the Government of Samoa expressed a keen interest in piloting a VCF\nthat operates in this lower range. As a result, an indicative feasibility study was commissioned\nby SPPF (Review of Feasibility) and extensive market research completed. The final step in the\nprocess  was  the  development  of  an  investment  memorandum  for  submission  to  the  proposed\nsubscribers:  (i)  IFC;  (ii)  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  (iii)  Australia  New  Zealand  Bank\n(ANZ), (iv) Development Bank of Samoa (DBS), and (v) Samoa National Provident Fund (NPF).\n\nB.\n\nStructure of Facility and Return on Investment\n\n3.\nThe recommended structure is a 100 percent equity financed facility, investing by way of\na  range  of  equity  and  quasi-equity  instruments  with  the  preferred  instrument  being  venture\ncapital loans. The internal rate of return (IRR) for this structure is 8.6 percent, which is below is\nexpected  in  more  mature  markets,  but  this  is  partly  attributable  to  (i)  very  conservative\nassumptions about the earnings of the typical investee company, (ii) delayed returns while the\ninvestee  overcomes  initial  losses,  and  (iii)  high  provisions  for  losses  on  equity  investments.\nLogically, a true VCF is preferably financed from equity. For Samoa, the proposed VCF will fund\nexpansion projects, at a somewhat lower risk than true venture capital, and therefore some level\nof gearing is acceptable and lower loan losses are more realistic.\n\n4.\nWith  VCF  investments  likely  to  be  primarily  in  established  businesses,  projected  loan\nlosses  should  be  significantly  less  than  might  be  the  case  with  mainly  seed  capital  or  true\nventure  investments.  However,  for  the  purpose  of  the  model,  a  very  conservative  25  percent\nloan  loss  provision  has  been  allowed  for  on  the  outstanding  portfolio.  This  produces  revenue\nlosses from year 1, which may be too conservative an assumption when calculating the IRR, but\nis a prudent safety factor. A typical investee company forecast has been prepared based on a\nconservative, agricultural model, paying interest at 20 percent per annum on its venture capital\nloan.\n\nC.\n\nThe Facility and its Management\n\n1.\n\nInvestment and Shareholder Contributions\n\nThe proposal is for the VCF to invest $240,000 annually for 7 years, using total funding\n5.\nof  $1,600,000  from  shareholders  plus  retained  earnings.  The  primary  shareholders  are\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nassumed  to  be  IFC,  ADB,  DBS,  NPF,  and  ANZ,  with  the  contributions  from  DBS  and  NPF  at\n12.5 percent each, ADB at 25 percent, IFC at 40 percent, and ANZ 10 percent.\n\nTable A4.1: Shareholders\u2019 Subscriptions\n\nPayment\nImmediate\nYear 3\nYear 5\nYear 6\nTotal\n\nTotal Subscription\n$'000\n480\n320\n320\n480\n1,600\n\n2.\n\nCorporate Structure\n\n6.\nRevisions to the original base case for the Project are being developed to better reflect\nbest practice. A two-tier structure of two legal entities is proposed: the fund (VCF) and a funds\nmanagement company (FMC). An FMC is being formed in Samoa and is being structured in line\nwith  other  management  companies  operating  small  funds  elsewhere  in  the  world,  under  IFC\nsupervision.  In  addition  to  this  and  in  line  with  IFC  policy  on  skills/technology  transfer  and\ncapacity building in-country, this FMC is being established with the view to it becoming a stand-\nalone facility in the long term and as a vehicle to attract local Samoan investors to supplant the\noriginal shareholders over time.\n\nThe  FMC  will  be  a  special  purpose  vehicle  nominally  capitalized  by  the  investors  and\n7.\nsubsidized by assistance agencies, that will operate under a management contract for the VCF.\nThe  VCF  board  members  will  be  appointed  pro  rata  to  shareholding,  with  ordinary  shares\ncarrying preemptive rights to enable primary sponsors to maintain control of shareholding in the\nearly years. Management to be described in Table A4.2.\n\nTable A4.2: Proposed Corporate Structure\n\nEntity\nThe Board\nCredit Committee\nFMC\n\nRole and Function\nPolicy, corporate governance, major decisions\nCredit decisions within policy, advisory role to FMC\nFund management\n\nFMC = funds management company.\n\n8.\nThe credit committee will comprise two local board members or alternates, together with\nthe  chief  executive  officer,  an  international  expert,  will  be  engaged  as  chief  executive  officer.\nSupport staff in the FMC will be three business analysts and an administrative secretary. Two of\nthe  analysts  are  to  be  seconded  for  one  to  two  years  from  DBS  and  the  NPF  to  learn  best\npractice equity and quasi-equity investment and transfer those skills back to their organizations.\n\n3.\n\nTarget Market\n\n9.\nThe  target  market  for  the  VCF  is  venture  capital  investments  of  less  than  ST300,000.\nRecommended  limits  are  ST50,000-ST250,000  with  an  upper  limit  of  50  percent  of  the  total\nequity (including the VCF contribution) for existing businesses and 40 percent for new ventures.\nProject size is therefore expected to range from roughly ST200,000-ST1,200,000 with between\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\n70 to 80 percent likely to be expansion and diversification projects. The investment focus will be\non projects that contribute to economic growth and, in particular, earn or save foreign exchange.\n\n4.\n\nInvestment Instrument\n\n10.\nThe  preferred  investment  instrument  will  be  straight  debt  instruments\u2014venture  capital\nloans\u2014because  of  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  investments,  and  the  cost  of  putting\ninvestments  in  place  and  simplifying  exit  options.  It  will  therefore  be  unsecured  subordinated\ndebt,  a  normal  loan  instrument  but  without  collateral  security  and  documented  to  rank  (or  be\nsubordinated) behind other debt. While this is the preferred simple instrument, the VCF will be\nable  to  use  all  other  normally  accepted  equity  and  quasi-equity  instruments  subject  to  well-\ndocumented  criteria.  A  financial  model  has  been  based  on  the  venture  loan  option  as  it  is\nanticipated this will be instrument used in the majority of cases.\n\n5.\n\nInterest on VC Loans\n\nThe  original  base  case  recommended  interest  to  be  20  percent  per  annum  on  venture\n11.\ncapital  loans  to  reflect  the  risk  involved  in  unsecured  investments.  Commercial  interest  rates\nhave been dropping in Samoa, and the base will be adjusted to better reflect the market.  Other\nincome will be earned from  application and establishment fees, each 1 percent of the amount\ninvested.\n\nSome of the investments will still be maturing in years 10-15, and therefore the life of the\n\n12.\nVCF will need to be 10 years or more.\n\n6.\n\nLife of the Facility\n\n7.\n\nExit Options\n\n13.\nExit  options  for  VCF  investments  are  likely  to  primarily  involve  existing  shareholders,\ntogether  with  their  families  and  associates.  Commercial  financiers  will  provide  take-out  where\nthe specific business matures and becomes bankable under conventional criteria. Public issues\nare  a  remote  prospect.  The  proposed  base  case  venture  capital  loan  structure  will  make  it\nsimple for exit to take place at any time, as the take-out will only need to cover loan principal\nand accrued interest, and no equity valuation issues will be involved.\n\n8.\n\nExternal Support for Operating Costs\n\n14.\nThe  original  base  case  assumes  that  the  aid  agencies  will  meet  the  cost  of  the  chief\nexecutive  officer's  remuneration  package,  and  other  cash  operating  costs,  for  the  first  three\nyears, and the officer's package thereafter. Another model shows that the portfolio size will need\nto roughly double, to $3.3 million, to produce comparable returns should all costs be borne by\nthe VCF. Projections for first-year operating costs, based on a stand-alone office, are presented\nin Table A4.3.\n\n\f57\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nTable A4.3: First Year Operating Costs Projection\n\nCost\nCEO Package\nOther Operating Costs\nTotal\nCEO = chief executive officer.\n\n$\n80,000\n65,500\n145,500\n\n15.\nAs the structure is under review, these costs and how they are to be met are yet to be\nfinalized. However, agreement in principle has already been made by the Australian and New\nZealand  governments  to  meet  the  original  base  case  operating  costs  and  salaries  on  a  50:50\nbasis for the first three years with review a for any further subsidies.\n\n9.\n\nRegulatory Environment and Taxation\n\nThere  are  no  obvious  barriers  to  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the  VCF,  and  the\n16.\nGovernment  of  Samoa  should  welcome  it.  The  VCF  will  come  within  the  ambit  of  the  Central\nBank  Act  and  the  Financial  Institutions  Act,  and  will  need  to  comply  with  those  acts  and\nassociated  guidelines  where  applicable.  Clarification  will  be  needed  from  the  Central  Bank  of\nSamoa on the extent of compliance required.\n\n17.\nThe  major  taxation  issue  will  be  the  potential  double  taxation  of  distributions  to\nshareholders  in  the  VCF  from  retained  earnings  already  taxed.  A  secondary  issue  is  the\npossible  taxation  of  profits  on  sale  on  investments,  where  the  VCF\u2019s  investment  is  by  way  of\nshares  rather  than  loans.  Those  instances  are  expected  to  be  rare,  but  the  taxation  issues\npertaining to the VCF need to be clarified.\n\n10.\n\nDevelopment Value\n\n18.\nThere is a clear gap in the market for equity or quasi-equity funding for the large group of\nundercapitalized  businesses.  No  formal  mechanism  exists  for  businesses  to  obtain  venture\ncapital funding of less than ST300,000. This is placing a severe constraint on the ability of the\nSamoan  business  community  to  generate  growth  in  the  economy.  The  VCF  therefore  has  the\ncapacity to make a substantial impact on desired growth sectors generally, and with particular\nemphasis on fishing, tourism, food processing, and manufacturing.\n\n19.\nTotal  investment  by  the  VCF  over  7-8  years  of  $1.7  million-2.7  million  (ST6.4  million-\nST10  million),  at  the  normal  contributions  of  sponsor  equity  could  have  a  multiplier  effect  of\ncreating up to $10 million (ST37.4 million) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment  would  be  expected  to  create  a  substantial  number  (estimated  minimum  500,  likely\nconsiderably  more)  of  additional  jobs,  vital  to  an  economy  where  job  creation  is  lagging  well\nbehind other growth projections and is a major policy aim of the Samoan government.\n\n11.\n\nInvestor Considerations and Risk Factors\n\n20.\nThe key country risk for external investors appears to be acceptable in view of the stable\npolitical environment and the fiscally responsible stance of the Samoan Government. The prime\nmarket risk is the small market size, and the relatively undeveloped secondary industry sector.\nFurther risk arises from the importance of expatriate remittances and aid agencies\u2019 contributions\nto  the  Samoan  gross  national  product  (10-20  percent  each).  However,  both  the  contributions\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\nhave  been  stable  over  time.  Clear  independence  from  Government  intervention  is  also  a\ndesirable  state,  especially  if  Government  institutions  are  represented  among  the  shareholders\nand directors.\n\nInvestee  risk  in  small-scale  businesses  is  largely  within  the  management  of  the\n21.\nbusiness,  i.e.,  the  management  is  the  risk.  The  main  mitigating  factors  will  be  the  objectivity,\ncompetence,  and  analytical  skills  of  the  VCF\u2019s  management  and  staff,  and  tight  investment\ncriteria to eliminate the higher risk applicants.

The physically compact\nnature  of  the  country  makes  it  very  easy  for  communities  to  communicate  with  each  other,  in\nsharp contrast to islands in Melanesia, which stretch over thousands of kilometres of sea.\n\nThe  two  main  islands  are  serviced  by  good  road  infrastructure,  and  daily  ferry  and  air\n\n4.\nservices connect the two islands.\n\nThe  urban  rural  divide  is  relatively  unpronounced  on  the  main  island  of  Upolu.  Daily\n5.\ncommuting  into  Apia  for  work,  particularly  from  villages  in  northwest  Upolu,  means  that  a\nsubstantial number of the population interchange daily between urban and rural life. Increasing\nurbanization  is  causing  a  shift  in  family  patterns.  The  concept  of  the  extended  family  as  an\noperational  unit  becomes  less  prominent  as  they  move  from  rural  to  urban  areas.  However,\nextended families still feature significantly in terms of collective support to meet obligations on a\nlarger scale.\n\nThe urban drift, coupled with continuing losses from out-migration has led to a shortage\n\n6.\nof labor for agricultural activities and support for communal village-based activities.\n\nAgricultural  production  remains  the  main  source  of  livelihood  security  for  almost  70\n7.\npercent of the population, with the smallholder family producing goods for household needs, for\nsale,  and for use in customary exchanges.  Formal employment in registered businesses  was\n7,643 as of March 2000, excluding the Yazaki factory. Most paid employment opportunities are\nin  the  Apia  urban  area.  Remittances  from  overseas  continue  to  be  a  major  source  of  cash\nincome within the family household.\n\n8.\nOver  80  percent  of  all  land  is  customary  land,  which  is  under  traditional  matai  control.\nThe land provides the major source of income for nearly 70 percent of the economically active\npopulation.  Alienation  of  customary  land  is  prohibited  by  law  (land  cannot  be  transferred  or\nmade freehold), although lease arrangements are possible.\n\nSamoans  generally  are  well  integrated  into  the  cash  economy.  Most  households  have\n9.\nfamily overseas who send regular remittances. In many cases, this is the only major source of\ncash  income  other  than  the  sale  of  surplus  produce.  Although  women  are  the  traditional\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nproducers of handicraft, the men more often obtain the income from the proceeds of any sale.\nWomen  are  the  savers,  while  men  control  and  determine  the  distribution  of  the  household\nincome.\n\nSocial  Organization.  Samoans  live  in  villages,  made  up  of  the  local  members  of  a\n10.\nnumber of \u2018aiga, usually beteen 20 and 40, with each \u2018aiga headed by a matai who is effectively\nthe head of the family, managing its lands and house sites, allocating labor and other resources,\nand  representing  the  group  in  the  village  council,  or  fono.  The  traditional  Samoan  village  is\norganized according to matai, the aualuma (daughters of the village), faletua and tausi (wives of\nthe matai), and aumaga  (untitled  men).  Authority,  defence,  and  the  production  of  food  are  the\nresponsibilities  of  the  men,  while  moral  authority,  ceremony,  hospitality,  and  the  production  of\nexchange valuables are the work of women.\n\nThe Pulenu\u2019u (village mayor) is the official link between the government and the village.\n11.\nEach village elects a representative to the Pulenu\u2019u committee for a three-year term. The final\ndecision  whether  to  accept  or  reject  proposed  development  programs  rests  with  the  village\ncouncils.\n\n12.\nVillages  operate  as  semiautonomous  polities  under  the  leadership  of  the  council  of\nchiefs,  and  the  womens  committee.  Every  family  is  represented  on  these  two  bodies.  The\nvillage  council  decides  issues  affecting  village  law  and  order,  land  issue  and  use,  and  food\nsecurity. Their decisions are binding, and sanctions can be harsh.\n\n13.\nThe  adoption  of  Christianity  in  the  nineteenth  century  brought  about  fundamental\nchanges to Samoan life and ideals. Villages become congregations through a covenant dividing\nlocal governance between the secular realm controlled by the matai councils, and the religious\nrealm, presided over by resident pastors.  The arrangement persists in every Samoan village to\ntoday.\n\n14.\nPastors are highly honored and respected, but the relationship between a pastor and a\nvillage sets the pastor apart from other leaders. The pastor has authority over church affairs but\nno formal say in the secular affairs of a village. It is part of the covenant, that pastors may not\ntake matai titles.\n\n15.\nPastors are called by village congregations, which the pastor's family with a house, gifts\nof  food,  a  money  income,  lands  for  planting,  etc.  The  money  income  comes  from  regular\ndonations from the congregation, which are publicly announced. Thus a very strong element of\ncompetition between the various aiga of a congregation exists, the outcome of which can affect\nthe status of the aiga  both in the church and the village life.\n\nBesides  supporting  the  pastor  (and  family),  the  congregations  also  build  and  maintain\n16.\ntheir  own  churches  and  other  facilities  such  as  meeting  places.  Churches  are  generally\nelaborate and the largest of structures in the rural area. Funds are raised through special levies\non the matai of a congregation, including those living overseas, and through organized parties\ntraveling to the migrant communities in New Zealand.\n\n17.\nMost  churches  open  with  a  substantial  debt  burden  as  church  loans  are  commonly\nfavored over enterprise loans because of the good repayment record. The key to repayment is\nthe  ceremonial  church  opening,  which  draw  large  crowds,  the  village  as  a  whole  and  church\nmembers from other villages, all bear contributions.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nThus,  these  social  and  traditional  practices  influence  the  control  of  resources  and\n18.\neconomic  decision  making  at  the  household  level.  The  land  tenure  system  and  social\nconsiderations,  as  related  to  credit,  savings,  and  enterprise  development,  are  taken  from  the\ngeneral  context  and  analyzed  in  greater  detail.  The  final  part  of  the  social  analysis  lists  the\nmajor issues and options related to social analysis.\n\nB.\n\nLand Tenure\n\nSome  80  percent  of  the  land  in  Samoa  is  held  under  customary  tenure,  being  divided\n19.\namong descent groups known as aiga, each of which is headed by a matai or chief, chosen by\nthe members of the aiga. The alienation of customary land is prohibited by law (land cannot be\ntransferred or made freehold), although lease arrangements are possible.\n\n20.\nThe  Land  and  Titles  Court  is  one  of  the  fundamental  institutions  of  the  Samoan  social\nand political life. The origin of the court lies in the 1889 Berlin Treaty\u2019s prohibition of the sale of\nthe  customary  land  outside  of  Apia  boundaries.  It  also  established  a  land  commission  to\ninvestigate claims. The Land and Titles court established in 1903 continued the policy regarding\nalienation of customary land, and took on responsibility for adjudicating rival Samoan claims to\nland and matai titles.\n\nUnder New Zealand administration, the prohibitions were further endorsed, and the 1962\n21.\nConstitution  laid  the  legal  framework  for  the  present  situation  whereby  land  is  held  \u201cin\naccordance  with  Samoan  custom  and  usage  and  the  law  relating  to  Samoan  custom  and\nusage.\u201d The currently relevant law is the Land and Titles Court Act of 1981, which provides that,\nin  all  matters  brought  before  it,  the  court  will  apply  (i)  customs  and  usage,  and  (ii)  the  law\nrelating to customs and usage.\n\n22.\nThe Court\u2019s jurisdiction is exercised by a President and at least two Samoan judges and\ntwo Samoan assessors; no less than four are on the bench for any court hearing. There are no\nwritten or oral opinions, which might constitute a body of legal precedent. Each case is decided\n\u201con  its  own  merits,\u201d  having  regard  for  both  general  opinion  and  acceptable  local  variations  to\ncustom.\n\n23.\nThere  is  some  evidence  that  on-the-ground  village  practices  have  for  some  time  been\ndiverging from what the court would regard as proper custom. There has been a considerable\ndegree of individualization, with people also being allowed to pass on lands to their immediate\nchildren, without any rights to dispose of the land through sale.\n\n24. \nNo  transition  freeholding  of  customary  land  is  implied  by  the  changes,  although  the\nsituation  is  further  confused  by  the  process  of  title-splitting  and  the  creation  of  new  titles  for\nvoting purposes, which has been ongoing at the same time as the alleged \u201cindividualization\u201d that\nis taking place.\n\n25.\nThe most recent Agricultural Survey (1993) identified that over 25 percent of agricultural\nhouseholds controlled less than the two hectares considered to be the minimum amount of land\na household would require access to, if they were to derive their total livelihood from agriculture.\nThe Apia Urban Youth Survey (1995) showed that 32 percent of youth felt that agriculture was a\nway to improve their economic life but access to land was a constraint.\n\n26.\nIn  summary,  customary  land  tenure  in  Samoa  is  tied  into  the  social  organization  of\nSamoans. The alienation of customary land is, and will remain, a challenging issue to tackle, as\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nland is the source of family identify and security. Although leasing of customary land is possible,\nthe financial Institutions reluctance to accept land leases as security has an impact on access to\ncredit.  Long-term  security  of  tenure  is  an  essential  precondition  to  extensive  agricultural\ndevelopment, which features a heavy investment in fixed assets.  With a continuing rural urban\nmigration drift, there is increased pressure for land. Demand for land is leading to the loss of an\nestimated  900  hectares  of  forest  annually  to  land  clearance  for  gardens  and  commercial\nplantations, leading to the degradation of watersheds, and increased run offs. The family matai\nallocates land to ensure that all members share the good as well as the poorer quality land, so\nland holding usually consists of a number of small parcels, not always contiguous. The division\nof  such  land, and the physical distance at times from the village, creates problems in working\nthe land economically.\n\nC.\n\nRole of Women\n\n27.\nAlthough  women  have  no  say  in  land  allocation,  or  the  village  law  and  order,  they\nnevertheless  hold  a  strong  and  effective  position  of  informal  power  within  the  village  affairs.\nWomen  are  considered  the  dominant  influence  in  terms  of  village  development.  The  women\u2019s\ncommittee  provides  the  energy,  drive,  and  staying  power  that  often  sees  a  village  project\nthrough to fruition.\n\nIn  the  village  ceremonial  affairs,  there  is  a  clear  distinction  between  the  unmarried\n28.\nwomen (usually young and born in the village), who together make up the aualuma, and those\nwho have married in, who are collectively known as faletua ma tausi. As \u201csisters\u201d to the men of\nthe  village,  the  aualuma  have  some  status,  as  shown  by  the  part  they  play  in  the  kava\npresentations, which mark formal intervillage gatherings. The in marrying \u201cwives\u201d have a much\nlesser formal status on such occasions, and are considered subservient to their husbands.\n\nBoth categories  of women  join the village women\u2019s committee, which is run by its own\n\n29.\ncouncil, with each woman filling a ranked position according to the rank of her husband.\n\n30.\nIn  addition  to  their  family  and  household  chores,  women  also  engage  in  other  income\nearning activities to supplement the family income. In the 20-29 year age group, an average of\n9.8 hours per week1 is devoted to the production of handicrafts, which subsequently are used as\nceremonial gifts or sold for cash.\n\n31. Women  are  the  majority  of  informal  traders.  A  visit  to  the  vegetable  market  at  Fugaleii\nand the handicraft market confirms women operate the majority of stalls. However, the control of\nthe income clearly lies with the male of the household.\n\n32.\nThe labor economy and division of labor within the household resembles at other areas\nof  Polynesia.  The  men  of  the  household  take  prime  responsibility  for  undertaking  household\nagriculture, farming, and fishing, while the female devotes her time to cooking, washing, looking\nafter  children,  and  handicraft  production.  Women  do  not  provide  substantial  inputs  into  the\nproduction of agricultural crops or produce, although the contribution of women and children to\nthe  small  family  units  is  becoming  more  significant  with  the  labor  shortage.  The  women  are\nresponsible for managing the family budget relative to the payment of school fees, etc.\n\n                                                \n1 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Diary entries Table 5.1.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nAt  marriage,  a  woman  will  generally  move  to  her  husband\u2019s  village.  She  does  not,\n33.\nhowever,  lose  membership  of  her  natural  aiga,  and  can  still  become  involved  in  meetings\nconcerned with title bestowals in the same way as other members do.\n\nD.\n\nVillage Business Enterprises\n\nPisinisi,  the  Samoan  word  for  business,  has  been  an  established  part  of  most  villages\n34.\nsince the beginning of the century, when retail stores were set up, which also acted as buyers of\ncopra for urban interests. In more recent years, they have been joined by bus operators, taxis,\nand  small  beach  fale  enterprises  aimed  at  the  domestic  and  international  lower-priced  tourist\nmarket.\n\nPisinisi carries prestige, distinguishing a person from other villagers, who are generally\n35.\npleased  to  make  use  of  the  services  provided.  Credit  sales  is  an  ever-present  risk,  and  is  a\nmajor  cause  of  business  failure  within  the  rural  sector.  Field  work  carried  out  during  the  TA\nidentified  that  although  a  village-based  business  might  collapse  as  a  result  of  credit  not  being\nrepaid, the members of the village who brought about the collapse through not repaying, felt no\nshame,  while  the  entrepreneur  whose  business  failed  often  felt  acutely  embarrassed,  with\nseveral examples being cited where the entrepreneur left the village completely.\n\nThere  is  an  expectation  that  village  businesses  will  contribute  generously  to  village\n36.\nactivities,  with  the  villagers  reciprocating  through  increased  loyalty  and  support  for  the\nentrepreneur. Such success can be readily converted into worthwhile matai titles.\n\nThe long-term ambition of such businessmen is to become a member of Parliament for\n\n37.\ntheir district, cashing in the obligations, loyalties, and trust they have built up over the years.\n\n38.\nA  lack  of  exposure  to  new  ideas  has  led  to  a  copy  cat  mentality  among  rural\nentrepreneurs,  as  evidenced  by  the  number  of  small  retail  food  stores  that  can  sometimes  be\nfound in one single village of 300-400 people. The four essential elements for microenterprise\ndevelopment  are  access  to  finance,  markets,  management,  and  technical  training.  A\ndiversification  of  the  economic  activities  at  the  village  level  is  an  essential  element  for\ndeveloping this sector.\n\n39.\nRemittances  in  cash  and  in  kind  from  overseas  are  often  a  high  component  of  total\nincomes  received  in  rural  households.  The  1998  household  income  and  expenditure  survey\nidentified,  on  a  national  basis,  in  excess  of  12  percent  of  all  household  income  comes  from\noverseas remittances. This component of total income is highest on the island of Savai'i, where\n19.4  percent  of  total  income  is  derived  from  overseas.  The  Women  in  Business  Foundation\nidentify this as a specific disincentive at the village level for starting microenterprises. Within a\nnational  context,  remittances  are  expected  to  maintain  their  long-term  growth  trend  rate  of\naround 3 percent in 2000.\n\nE.\n\nSavings and Credit\n\n40. Within  the  Samoan  culture,  it  is  rare  for  an  individual  to  accumulate  wealth.  Instead,\npeople are expected to give money, goods, and services to meet the social obligations of their\nfamilies  through  fa\u2019alavelave.  The  family  matai  is  responsible  for  distributing  these  items  on\nbehalf  of  the  family.  Obligations  under  fa\u2019alavelave  can  be  demanding  and  immediate,  often\nrequiring  families  to  contribute  to  the  costs  of  funerals  and  weddings  at  very  short  notice.\n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 10, page 6\n\nIgnoring these responsibilities can result in being ostracized within the family and cut off socially\nfrom the village.\n\n41.\nNegative  saving  has  prevailed  since  1985,  largely  the  result  of  high  levels  of\nconsumption  induced  by  substantial  inflows  of  personal  remittances  from  overseas.  Previous\nstudies  have  concluded  that  \u201cSamoans  do  not  save,\u201d  although  this  needs  to  be  considered  in\nthe context of social and cultural obligations imposed through fa\u2019alavelave.\n\nFa\u2019alavelale  does  represent  a  form  of  obligation  on  the  part  of  the  party  receiving  the\n\n42.\nbenefits of fa\u2019alavelave to reciprocate in kind at some yet to be determined time in the future.\nWithin the villages, a number of business entrepreneurs provide a form of in-kind credit to rural\nhouseholds,  either  taking  security  over  a  fine  mat  or  similar,  or  trading  credit  for  copra,  thus\nexpanding their clientele.\n\n43.\nThe  absence  of  a  reliable,  and  regular  source  of  income  among  village  households,\nplaces  further  obligations  on  wageearners  to  act  as  personal  guarantors  to  those  wishing  to\naccess  credit  for  business  purposes.  The  change  in  emphasis  by  the  Development  Bank  of\nSamoa  from  debt  servicing  being  met  from  the  proceeds  of  the  microenterprise,  to  one  of\nserviceability  coming  from  regular  income  of  the  borrower  and  guarantors  further  reinforces\nthese obligations.\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nCAPACITY BUILDING OF FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS ADVISORY INTERMEDIARIES\n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\nThe  objectives  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  are  to  assist  the  Government  in\nstrengthening the financial and business advisory intermediaries involved in implementation of\nthe  Small  Business  Development  Project  (the  Project),  particularly  the  Small  Business\nEnterprise  Centre  (SBEC),  the  Development  Bank  of  Samoa  (DBS),  and  the  Women  in\nBusiness Foundation (WIBF); and to assist the Government with ongoing efforts to improve the\nlegal  and  regulatory  environment  for  the  corporate  sector  generally,  in  particular  those  areas\nthat impact the micro- and small enterprise (MSE) sector.\n\nB.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n2.\nThe  Treasury  Department  (TD)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.

The consultants will report to TD and the manager of the\nProject management unit (PMU).\n\n4.\nThe TA includes funds for office equipment, which will be procured by the consultants in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The consultants will be responsible for the\nconduct of various training workshops.\n\n5.\nThe TA will be implemented over the period of the Project, which is due to commence in\nFebruary  2001  and  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2005.  Each  of  the  consultants  will  submit\ninception reports within two weeks of commencing their services, draft final reports two weeks\nbefore  the  end  of  their  services,  and  final  reports  incorporating  the  comments  of  TD,  the\nrelevant implementing agencies, and ADB. Consolidated progress, draft final, and final reports\nwill  be  submitted  by  the  team  leader  (expected  to  be  one  of  the  commercial/company  law\nspecialists) at the conclusion of the TA to TD and ADB. TD will disseminate the reports to the\nrelevant agencies.\n\nC.\n\nTentative Terms of Reference for Consultants\n\n1.\n\nInternational Experts\n\na.\n\nCommercial and Company Law Specialist(s)\n\n6.\nThe consultant(s) will have a law degree and experience in one or more of the following:\n(i) secured transactions, (ii) land law (particularly as it may apply to customary land), (iii) credit\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nreference facilities, and (iv) loan guarantee schemes.
