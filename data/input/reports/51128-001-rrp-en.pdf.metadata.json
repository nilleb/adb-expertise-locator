True North VI intends to acquire mainly controlling stakes in these companies, enabling \nthe  fund  to  take  active  management  roles  to  execute  operational  improvements  and  drive \ncontinued growth. True North is expected to exit its investments in these portfolio companies after \nan expected hold period of 4-7 years to allow sufficient time to create value. With the proposed \ninvestment, ADB will be providing equity capital to a portfolio of companies in India that are backed \nby  proven  management  teams,  established  business  models  and  strong  market  positions  to \nachieve their next phase of growth. This growth is expected to generate employment, increase \ntax revenues for the government, and provide impetus for the overall growth of the private sector \nin India.   \n \n\n \nA. \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nDescription. True North represents, as a group, one of India\u2019s leading and well-regarded \n3. \nprivate equity fund managers.1 The manager of True North Fund I, True North Ventures Private \nLimited,  was  established  in  1999  with  Vishal  Nevatia  as  chief  executive  officer  and  managing \npartner.2 Nevatia has led the manager of each True North fund to date, and will be leading the \nmanager.3 Nevatia has built a stable and cohesive investment team of 19 professionals who have \nworked on the True North funds. Seven of these are investment managers who focus on deal \norigination and structuring, relationship management, and exits. The remaining 12 professionals \nare  business  managers  who  focus  on  due  diligence  of  new  investment  opportunities  and \noperational engagement with portfolio companies. \n \n4. \nSince 2000, True North has raised more than $1.9 billion through five fund vehicles [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. True North is one of the few private equity \nfund  managers  in  India  with  expertise  in  executing  control-oriented,  expansion  capital \ntransactions in the middle market segment; it has executed 19 control deals to date.4 The limited \npartners  in  True  North\u2019s  earlier  funds  have  continuously  supported  the  platform  through \nsuccessive  fund  vintages,  thereby  demonstrating  a  high  level  of  investor  confidence.  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n\n                                                \n1  True North Enterprise Private Limited (manager) True North Managers LLP (sponsor), and entities that have acted \n\nas managers of True North\u2019s previous funds are collectively referred to as True North. \n2  True North Ventures Private Limited was originally known as GW Capital Private Limited. \n3  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n4  Middle  market  refers  to  companies  with  a  pre-money  enterprise  value  of  up  to  $750  million.  Control  refers  to \ninvestments where True North owns an equity stake of more than 50% in a portfolio company, and hence controls \nor strongly influences its management and operations.  \n\n\f2 \n\n97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. True North is headquartered in Mumbai \nwith a smaller office in Bengaluru. \n \n5. \nInvestment  identification.  True  North  represents  a  valuable  addition  to  the  existing \nprivate equity portfolio of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and is consistent with ADB\u2019s internal \nprivate  equity  funds  investment  guidelines.  The  fund  manager  has  operational  expertise  and \ninvestment experience in sectors such as financial services and health care, which align with the \ninvestment mandate of ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations. [This information has been removed as \nit  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(viii)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications  Policy  (2011)].  Therefore,  True  North\u2019s  platform  is  a  high-quality  investment \nopportunity  that  is  expected  to  help  improve  the  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  fund \ninvestments in India as well as generate attractive co-investment opportunities. \n \n6. \nThe proposed investment\u2019s development impact stems from True North\u2019s ability to improve \nand grow middle-market companies in India. True North\u2019s dedicated business management team \ncomprises specialists with longstanding operational experience in business strategy, marketing, \nsupply chain management, working capital optimization, procurement, pricing, human resources, \nand  treasury  management.  In  2015,  True  North  created  a  technology  and  analytics  team  that \nworks  with portfolio companies,  incorporating  analytics,  algorithms,  and artificial  intelligence  to \nimprove decision making and operational efficiency. True North is also able to call upon a panel \nof local senior industry advisors to provide guidance on key business matters. To ensure strong \nalignment  with  its  portfolio  companies,  True  North  develops  business  plans  with milestones  in \ndiscussion with company promoters and management teams before investing. \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n7. \nTrue North is about to launch its sixth fund, True North Fund VI LLP. True North VI will be \na  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)] closed-end private equity fund \nthat aims to make up to 10 equity investments of $50 million\u2013$150 million.5 In some instances, \nwhere capital may be deployed over multiple tranches as a portfolio company scales up, the total \ninvestment  size  may  be  larger  and  additional  co-investment  capital  may  be  sought  from  its \ninvestors.  Focus  sectors  for  True  North  VI  include  financial  services  (nonbanking  finance \ncompanies,  microfinance,  affordable  housing \n(services,  non-\npharmaceutical), and consumer businesses. True North is building domain expertise and hiring \nspecialist  investment  professionals  to  target  investments  in  technology  products  and  services \ncompanies.  \n \n8. \nTrue  North  aims to provide  capital  to middle-market companies  in India with  significant \ngrowth  prospects  and/or  the  potential  to  gain  significant  market  share  in  their  respective \nindustries. These  companies  typically  are  established businesses  on the verge  of  entering the \nnext phase of growth. True North also targets high-potential companies at early stages of growth \nthat need more time to fully mature. True North primarily provides capital to fund business growth \nand, to a lesser extent, may provide liquidity to business founders. It expects its managed funds \nto hold their investments for 4\u20137 years to allow sufficient time to create value. The average holding \nperiod for True North\u2019s realized investments is just under 5 years. \n \n\nfinance),  health  care \n\n                                                \n5   [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n\fTrue North differentiates itself in the Indian private equity market (dominated by minority \n9. \ninvestors) by mostly investing controlling stakes in portfolio companies. Subsequently, True North \nengages its in-house business managers to actively partner with management teams to improve \noperations and help grow these companies. It has also sourced candidates to fill more than 30 \nfirst-  and  second-tier  management  roles  in  portfolio  companies  since  2014  (many  of  these \nindividuals were identified prior to the investment closing). True North also recruits to strengthen \nand  grow  the  pool  of  management  trainees  available  to  portfolio  companies.  By  building \nbusinesses as the majority shareholder, where international best practices are applied and top-\nquality management inducted, the resulting assets can potentially be sold to strategic buyers as \nwell as financial buyers (including private equity funds). True North targets approximately 70% of \nTrue North VI\u2019s capital to be invested in control deals. \n \nTo  augment  its  majority  stakes,  True  North  may  invest  up  to  30%  of  True  North  VI  in \n10. \nminority investments. However, it will only participate in such investments where (i) the business \nstrategy and exit path are aligned with that of the majority owner\u2019s, and (ii) it can add value to the \nportfolio company from a minority position. True North may also commit a portion of ADB\u2019s capital \ntoward  listed  companies  and  opportunistic  investments  (such  as  pre-initial  public  offering \nfinancings  and  private  investment  in  public  equity  transactions)  to  create  early  liquidity \nopportunities for investors.6  \n \nTrue  North\u2019s  success  has  been  built  on  well-researched  market  mappings  of  preferred \n11. \nsectors and the cultivation of strong relationships with a wide range of sponsors and companies. \nIt  prefers  to  build  a  prequalified  pipeline  of  deals  (where  business  fundamentals,  profitability, \ngrowth  prospects,  sector  attractiveness,  company  positioning,  and  other  factors  have  been \nassessed)  to  determine  its  target  fund  size,  which  provides  investors  with  a  high  degree  of \nconfidence that it can deploy the committed capital within a fund\u2019s investment period. For True \nNorth\u2019s previous 40 investments, it evaluated about 150 prequalified leads from a pool of 2,500 \nopportunities. \n \nC. \n\nOwnership, Management, and Governance \n\n12. \nOwnership. True North VI will be structured as an Indian limited liability partnership and \nwill  be  registered  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  as  a  category  II \nalternative investment fund. The fund is awaiting approvals from the relevant authorities, including \nSEBI, and is expected to officially launch in December 2017. Indian investors will invest through \nan Indian feeder fund, while international investors will invest through an offshore Mauritian feeder \nfund. ADB will invest directly into True North VI. This structure is explained in more detail in the \nownership,  management,  and  governance  and  the  integrity  disclosure  document.7  Information \nconcerning the anti-money laundering (AML) and integrity due diligence is also included.8  \n \nThe  manager  will  enter  an  investment  management  agreement  with  True  North  VI  to \n13. \nprovide management support and administrative services in return for a fee. The manager (an \nIndian limited liability company) and the sponsor (an Indian limited liability partnership) will be the \ninitial partners in True North VI and will nominate two individuals to act as the designated partners \nof the fund, as required under Indian law. \n \n                                                \n6   A form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company. \n7   Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2003.

True  North  VI\u2019s  management  will  comprise  15  professionals.  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(viii)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].  The  management  team  will  retain  an \nindustry  advisory  board  consisting  of  individuals  with  substantial  knowledge,  experience,  and \nnetworking  strengths  that  are  invaluable  for  identifying,  evaluating,  and  building  quality \nbusinesses. These industry advisors are not exclusively associated with True North in India, but \nthey provide reference checks, market intelligence, and other strategic inputs as required. \n\nGovernance structure: investment committee and board of advisors. An investment \n15. \ncommittee will make all decisions related to investments and exit opportunities. [This information \nhas  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(viii)  of \nADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  (2011)].9 The  committee  will  have  oversight  of  the  value \ncreation  paths  and  exit  preparations  of  all  portfolio  companies  and  will  meet  on  a  semiannual \nbasis, or as required. This oversight includes decisions concerning further disbursement of capital \nto portfolio companies to fund their expansion activities during the holding period. True North VI \nwill  also  form  a  board  of  advisors  consisting  of  up  to  seven  members  representing  its  limited \npartners (board of advisors). The designated partners, key persons, and manager will consult with \nthe board of advisors and obtain its approval on certain matters involving conflicts of interest.10 \n \n16. \nThe typical True North deal team, which originates and processes a new investment, is \ncomprised  of  the  team  leader,  a  supporting  investment  manager,  and  a  supporting  business \nmanager.    The  team  is  responsible  for  evaluating  deals,  preparing  investment  theses,  and \nconducting  due  diligence  on target  companies.  Evaluating  and  executing  a  new  investment  at \nTrue North is a three-stage process. During the first stage, a deal team presents the investment \nopportunity to the True North team at a weekly pipeline meeting for preliminary evaluation of new \ninvestment  opportunities.  If  there  is  consensus,  the  investment  progresses  to  the  next  stage \nwhere the deal team prepares an investment memo that addresses all preliminary issues. During \nthe  second  stage,  the  investment  committee  conducts  a  more  rigorous  evaluation  at  the  deal \npipeline meeting. Key parameters for the term sheet, which summarizes the commercial and legal \nterms of the proposed investment, are also decided at this stage. If approved, the deal proceeds \nto the final stage, where a due diligence blueprint is developed that will either confirm or reject \nthe  investment  thesis  of  the  deal  team.  Once  due  diligence  has  been  completed  and  the \ninvestment  thesis  confirmed,  a  final  term  sheet  is  prepared  and  presented  to  the  investment \ncommittee along with any changes in the deal parameters for final approval. \n \n17. \nDecision making in True North is an iterative process. Deal teams comprise members from \nthe investment management and business management teams, and all deals must be led by a \nsenior  partner.  The  investment  committee  members  review  each  deal  before  a  term  sheet  is \nissued  and  approve  any  changes  to  valuations  or  key  deal  parameters  of  those  previously \nreviewed.  True North\u2019s investment committee and its deal teams include both investment and \nbusiness managers to enable a fully integrated approach to investments. \n \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \n\n18. \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n                                                \n9   [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \n\nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n\n10 The board of advisors will not participate in True North VI\u2019s investment process nor will it make investment decisions. \n\n\f \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n19. \nADB will provide an equity investment of up to $50,000,000 (but not more than 25% of the \ntotal committed capital provided that ADB will not be the single largest investor) in True North VI. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\n20. \nTrue North has indicated that it aims to achieve a target gross IRR for True North VI of \n25% in Indian rupee terms. [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to \ndisclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExit  strategy.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \n21. \ndisclosure specified  in paragraph 97(viii)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications Policy  (2011)].  The \nanticipated  exit  strategies  for  True  North  VI\u2019s  investments  include  public  offerings  on  Indian \nexchanges,  trade  sales  of  portfolio  companies  to  local  and  foreign  strategic  buyers,  and \nsecondary sales to other private equity funds. True North\u2019s investment team reviews the exit path \nfor each portfolio company every 6 months and starts the process of selling a business a full year \nbefore it expects the exit to take place. The quality and dominant market position of True North\u2019s \nassets,  together  with  its  ability  to  deliver  controlling  stakes,  attract  both  strategic  and  financial \ninterest  even  in  challenging  business  cycles.  Consequently,  True  North  has  managed  to  exit \nportfolio companies successfully and provide liquidity to investors despite India\u2019s recent economic \ndownturn. \n \nReporting arrangements. True North VI will be required to provide ADB with quarterly \n22. \nunaudited  reports,  audited  financial  statements,  annual  reports,  a  fund  overview,  an  annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring report, a portfolio overview, and summary information on \neach portfolio company\u2019s performance. ADB will review this information and follow up  with the \nmanager  if  more  information  or  clarification  is  needed.  If  the  information  received  from  the \nmanager raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in  True North VI, ADB \ncould decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed reviews. \n \nTrue North VI will be required to adopt an environmental and social management system \n23. \n(ESMS) compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) before the first disbursement \nand to report annually on environmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing \nand quality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance if the designated partners require clarification \non ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  standard  framework.  True  North\u2019s  existing  environmental \n24. \nand social policies were created to satisfy CDC Group\u2019s requirements as an investor in Fund II \nand Fund III, and these policies have not changed.11 As part of ADB\u2019s investment, True North has \n\n                                                \n11  CDC  Group is  a  United  Kingdom development  finance institution  that is  wholly  owned  by the  Government of  the \n\nUnited Kingdom. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\ncommitted  to  enhancing  and  expanding  its  environmental  and  social  policies  and  manuals  to \nincorporate an ESMS compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n25. \nAnti-money laundering and integrity framework. True North VI is subject to the AML \nand  know-your-customer  requirements  of  SEBI.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  proposed  investment  in  the \nfund,  True  North  has  committed  to  expanding  True  North  VI\u2019s  AML  and  integrity  framework, \nincluding enhancing AML and integrity requirements for screening investors of True North VI and \nthe sellers and buyers of portfolio investments.12 \n \n26. \nDiversifying  investor  base.  True  North\u2019s  philosophy  is  to  maintain  a  diversified,  well-\nbalanced institutional investor base. It seeks funding from ADB to benefit from its longstanding \npresence  in  Asia,  its  network  and  operational  experience,  and  its  status  as  a  multilateral \ndevelopment financial institution.

True  North  hopes  to  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  ability  to  provide \ndebt and equity financing directly to its portfolio companies.

Private  equity  funding  for  middle-market  companies  in  India  increased, \ncontributing to economic growth, the creation of quality jobs, and improved business efficiency \nand  transparency.  Access  to  and  affordability  of  basic  services  increased,  including  banking, \ninsurance, financial services, and health care. Viability of business models based on sound social \npractices demonstrated.  \n \n38. \nOutcome. The financial and social sustainability of private equity investments in Indian \nmiddle-market companies has been demonstrated. Investee companies supported by True North \nVI are expected to yield an aggregate IRR of at least 8%, increasing the employment generated \nand the contributions to government revenues through tax payments. \n \nOutputs. True North VI is established and capital invested. Final closing is expected by \n39. \nthe second quarter of 2018, with the successful deployment of the committed capital among at \nleast eight companies targeted by 2025. \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n40. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Finance sector development is \none of the five core areas of ADB\u2019s operations. The proposed investment also aligns well  with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which seeks to promote inclusive economic growth in developing member \ncountries through the development of the private sector.13 As control investors in India\u2019s middle \nmarket segment, True North actively manages its investee companies to grow their businesses \nsustainably, thereby contributing to capital mobilization, job creation, and private sector growth. \nThe proposed investment is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 \nfor India, which highlights investment in financial infrastructure, including investment funds, as a \npriority area.14 \n  \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The ADB Operational \n41. \nPlan  for  Health,  2015\u20132020  strongly  supports  private  sector  approaches  to  address  quality, \nefficiency,  and  financing  issues  in  the  health  sector.15  By  investing  in  True  North  VI,  ADB  is \npartnering with a leading investment manager in India that has identified health care as one of its \ncore  target  sectors.  Health  care  investments  made  by  the  fund  are  expected  to  improve  the \nquality,  efficiency,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  health  services  and  delivery  modalities  for \nunderserved populations in India. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nConsidering the environment and social impacts and risks of the likely future portfolio of \n42. \nTrue North VI, the investment is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Although  the  fund\u2019s  focus  is  to  finance  companies \noperating in sectors such as finance, health care, and consumer and technology products and \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2014.

However, it does \nnot envisage investing in sectors that would be categorized high risk for environment and social \nimpact. Should it ever support a category A project (for environment, involuntary resettlement, or \nindigenous peoples), ADB would exercise its right to opt out of funding the investment. \n \n43. \nTrue North will be required to (i) build upon its current practices and procedures; (ii) update \nand  expand  its  policies  and  manuals  to  incorporate  an  environmental,  health  and  safety,  and \nsocial  management  system  commensurate  with  the  level  of  potential  environment  and  social \nimpacts and risks of its likely portfolio; and (iii) ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The ESMS will be developed prior to the first disbursement and will include (but not \nbe limited to) screening procedures for categorizing projects based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. Requests for each subsequent disbursement for a proposed investment \nwill require ADB\u2019s affirmation and concurrence on the proposed categorization and adequacy of \nenvironmental and social due diligence documentation. \n \n44. \nThe  ESMS  will  outline  requirements  for  screening  against  ADB's  prohibited  investment \nactivities list, and for compliance, as applicable, with national laws and regulations and measures \nto  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001).16 True North VI will monitor the environment and social performance \nof its investee companies and submit to ADB an annual environment and social monitoring report \ndocumenting overall environmental and social performance and reporting any noncompliance as \nwell  as  measures  undertaken  to  address  them.  The  transaction  is  categorized  as  having  no \ngender elements.17 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n45. \nTrue  North  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed equity investment is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \n\n46. \nsingle investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\n47. \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of India \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to True North VI.18 ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2001.
