I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $50,000,000 in True North Fund VI LLP (True North VI) in India.  \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s investment will contribute to the capitalization of True North VI, a [This information \nhas been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)] private equity fund established to provide growth \ncapital to Indian companies in the financial services, healthcare, consumer, and technology \nsectors. True North VI intends to acquire mainly controlling stakes in these companies, enabling \nthe fund to take active management roles to execute operational improvements and drive \ncontinued growth. True North is expected to exit its investments in these portfolio companies after \nan expected hold period of 4-7 years to allow sufficient time to create value. With the proposed \ninvestment, ADB will be providing equity capital to a portfolio of companies in India that are backed \nby proven management teams, established business models and strong market positions to \nachieve their next phase of growth. This growth is expected to generate employment, increase \ntax revenues for the government, and provide impetus for the overall growth of the private sector \nin India.   \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n3.  Description. True North represents, as a group, one of India\u2019s leading and well-regarded \nprivate equity fund managers.1 The manager of True North Fund I, True North Ventures Private \nLimited, was established in 1999 with Vishal Nevatia as chief executive officer and managing \npartner.2 Nevatia has led the manager of each True North fund to date, and will be leading the \nmanager.3 Nevatia has built a stable and cohesive investment team of 19 professionals who have \nworked on the True North funds. Seven of these are investment managers who focus on deal \norigination and structuring, relationship management, and exits. The remaining 12 professionals \nare  business  managers  who  focus  on  due  diligence  of  new  investment  opportunities  and \noperational engagement with portfolio companies. \n \n4.  Since 2000, True North has raised more than $1.9 billion through five fund vehicles [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. True North is one of the few private equity \nfund  managers  in  India  with  expertise  in  executing  control-oriented,  expansion  capital \ntransactions in the middle market segment; it has executed 19 control deals to date.4 The limited \npartners  in  True  North\u2019s  earlier  funds  have  continuously  supported  the  platform  through \nsuccessive fund vintages, thereby demonstrating a high level of investor confidence.  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n                                                \n1  True North Enterprise Private Limited (manager) True North Managers LLP (sponsor), and entities that have acted \nas managers of True North\u2019s previous funds are collectively referred to as True North. \n2  True North Ventures Private Limited was originally known as GW Capital Private Limited. \n3  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. \n4  Middle market refers to companies with a pre-money enterprise value of up to $750 million. Control refers to \ninvestments where True North owns an equity stake of more than 50% in a portfolio company, and hence controls \nor strongly influences its management and operations.  ", "2 \n97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. True North is headquartered in Mumbai \nwith a smaller office in Bengaluru. \n \n5.  Investment identification. True North represents a valuable addition to the existing \nprivate equity portfolio of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and is consistent with ADB\u2019s internal \nprivate equity funds investment guidelines. The fund manager has operational expertise and \ninvestment experience in sectors such as financial services and health care, which align with the \ninvestment mandate of ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations. [This information has been removed as \nit  falls  within  exceptions  to  disclosure  specified  in  paragraph  97(viii)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy (2011)]. Therefore, True North\u2019s platform is a high-quality investment \nopportunity that is expected to help improve the performance of ADB\u2019s private equity fund \ninvestments in India as well as generate attractive co-investment opportunities. \n \n6.  The proposed investment\u2019s development impact stems from True North\u2019s ability to improve \nand grow middle-market companies in India. True North\u2019s dedicated business management team \ncomprises specialists with longstanding operational experience in business strategy, marketing, \nsupply chain management, working capital optimization, procurement, pricing, human resources, \nand treasury management. In 2015, True North created a technology and analytics team that \nworks with portfolio companies, incorporating analytics, algorithms, and artificial intelligence to \nimprove decision making and operational efficiency. True North is also able to call upon a panel \nof local senior industry advisors to provide guidance on key business matters. To ensure strong \nalignment with its portfolio companies, True North develops business plans with milestones in \ndiscussion with company promoters and management teams before investing. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n7.  True North is about to launch its sixth fund, True North Fund VI LLP. True North VI will be \na [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in \nparagraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)] closed-end private equity fund \nthat aims to make up to 10 equity investments of $50 million\u2013$150 million.5 In some instances, \nwhere capital may be deployed over multiple tranches as a portfolio company scales up, the total \ninvestment size may be larger and additional co-investment capital may be sought from its \ninvestors.  Focus  sectors  for  True  North  VI  include  financial  services  (nonbanking  finance \ncompanies,  microfinance,  affordable  housing  finance),  health  care  (services,  non-\npharmaceutical), and consumer businesses. True North is building domain expertise and hiring \nspecialist investment professionals to target investments in technology products and services \ncompanies.  \n \n8.  True North aims to provide capital to middle-market companies in India with significant \ngrowth  prospects  and/or  the  potential  to  gain  significant  market  share  in  their  respective \nindustries. These companies typically are established businesses on the verge of entering the \nnext phase of growth. True North also targets high-potential companies at early stages of growth \nthat need more time to fully mature. True North primarily provides capital to fund business growth \nand, to a lesser extent, may provide liquidity to business founders. It expects its managed funds \nto hold their investments for 4\u20137 years to allow sufficient time to create value. The average holding \nperiod for True North\u2019s realized investments is just under 5 years. \n \n                                                \n5  [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. ", "3 \n9.  True North differentiates itself in the Indian private equity market (dominated by minority \ninvestors) by mostly investing controlling stakes in portfolio companies. Subsequently, True North \nengages its in-house business managers to actively partner with management teams to improve \noperations and help grow these companies. It has also sourced candidates to fill more than 30 \nfirst- and second-tier management roles in portfolio companies since 2014 (many of these \nindividuals were identified prior to the investment closing). True North also recruits to strengthen \nand  grow  the  pool  of  management  trainees  available  to  portfolio  companies.  By  building \nbusinesses as the majority shareholder, where international best practices are applied and top-\nquality management inducted, the resulting assets can potentially be sold to strategic buyers as \nwell as financial buyers (including private equity funds). True North targets approximately 70% of \nTrue North VI\u2019s capital to be invested in control deals. \n \n10.  To augment its majority stakes, True North may invest up to 30% of True North VI in \nminority investments. However, it will only participate in such investments where (i) the business \nstrategy and exit path are aligned with that of the majority owner\u2019s, and (ii) it can add value to the \nportfolio company from a minority position. True North may also commit a portion of ADB\u2019s capital \ntoward  listed  companies  and  opportunistic  investments  (such  as  pre-initial  public  offering \nfinancings  and  private  investment  in  public  equity  transactions)  to  create  early  liquidity \nopportunities for investors.6  \n \n11.  True North\u2019s success has been built on well-researched market mappings of preferred \nsectors and the cultivation of strong relationships with a wide range of sponsors and companies. \nIt prefers to build a prequalified pipeline of deals (where business fundamentals, profitability, \ngrowth prospects, sector attractiveness, company positioning, and other factors have been \nassessed) to determine its target fund size, which provides investors with a high degree of \nconfidence that it can deploy the committed capital within a fund\u2019s investment period. For True \nNorth\u2019s previous 40 investments, it evaluated about 150 prequalified leads from a pool of 2,500 \nopportunities. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n12.  Ownership. True North VI will be structured as an Indian limited liability partnership and \nwill be registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a category II \nalternative investment fund. The fund is awaiting approvals from the relevant authorities, including \nSEBI, and is expected to officially launch in December 2017. Indian investors will invest through \nan Indian feeder fund, while international investors will invest through an offshore Mauritian feeder \nfund. ADB will invest directly into True North VI. This structure is explained in more detail in the \nownership, management, and governance and the integrity disclosure document.7 Information \nconcerning the anti-money laundering (AML) and integrity due diligence is also included.8  \n \n13.  The manager will enter an investment management agreement with True North VI to \nprovide management support and administrative services in return for a fee. The manager (an \nIndian limited liability company) and the sponsor (an Indian limited liability partnership) will be the \ninitial partners in True North VI and will nominate two individuals to act as the designated partners \nof the fund, as required under Indian law. \n \n                                                \n6  A form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company. \n7  Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2003.

True  North  VI\u2019s  management  will  comprise  15  professionals.  [This \ninformation has been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph \n97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. The management team will retain an \nindustry advisory board consisting of individuals with substantial knowledge, experience, and \nnetworking  strengths  that  are  invaluable  for  identifying,  evaluating,  and  building  quality \nbusinesses. These industry advisors are not exclusively associated with True North in India, but \nthey provide reference checks, market intelligence, and other strategic inputs as required. \n15.  Governance structure: investment committee and board of advisors. An investment \ncommittee will make all decisions related to investments and exit opportunities. [This information \nhas been removed as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)].9 The committee will have oversight of the value \ncreation paths and exit preparations of all portfolio companies and will meet on a semiannual \nbasis, or as required. This oversight includes decisions concerning further disbursement of capital \nto portfolio companies to fund their expansion activities during the holding period. True North VI \nwill also form a board of advisors consisting of up to seven members representing its limited \npartners (board of advisors). The designated partners, key persons, and manager will consult with \nthe board of advisors and obtain its approval on certain matters involving conflicts of interest.10 \n \n16.  The typical True North deal team, which originates and processes a new investment, is \ncomprised of the team leader, a supporting investment manager, and a supporting business \nmanager.  The team is responsible for evaluating deals, preparing investment theses, and \nconducting due diligence on target companies. Evaluating and executing a new investment at \nTrue North is a three-stage process. During the first stage, a deal team presents the investment \nopportunity to the True North team at a weekly pipeline meeting for preliminary evaluation of new \ninvestment opportunities. If there is consensus, the investment progresses to the next stage \nwhere the deal team prepares an investment memo that addresses all preliminary issues. During \nthe second stage, the investment committee conducts a more rigorous evaluation at the deal \npipeline meeting. Key parameters for the term sheet, which summarizes the commercial and legal \nterms of the proposed investment, are also decided at this stage. If approved, the deal proceeds \nto the final stage, where a due diligence blueprint is developed that will either confirm or reject \nthe investment thesis of the deal team. Once due diligence has been completed and the \ninvestment thesis confirmed, a final term sheet is prepared and presented to the investment \ncommittee along with any changes in the deal parameters for final approval. \n \n17.  Decision making in True North is an iterative process. Deal teams comprise members from \nthe investment management and business management teams, and all deals must be led by a \nsenior partner. The investment committee members review each deal before a term sheet is \nissued and approve any changes to valuations or key deal parameters of those previously \nreviewed.  True North\u2019s investment committee and its deal teams include both investment and \nbusiness managers to enable a fully integrated approach to investments. \n \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n18.

", "5 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $50,000,000 (but not more than 25% of the \ntotal committed capital provided that ADB will not be the single largest investor) in True North VI. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n20.  True North has indicated that it aims to achieve a target gross IRR for True North VI of \n25% in Indian rupee terms. [This information has been removed as it falls within exceptions to \ndisclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  Exit  strategy.  [This  information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  within  exceptions  to \ndisclosure specified in paragraph 97(viii) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011)]. The \nanticipated exit strategies for True North VI\u2019s investments include public offerings on Indian \nexchanges,  trade  sales  of  portfolio  companies  to  local  and  foreign  strategic  buyers,  and \nsecondary sales to other private equity funds. True North\u2019s investment team reviews the exit path \nfor each portfolio company every 6 months and starts the process of selling a business a full year \nbefore it expects the exit to take place. The quality and dominant market position of True North\u2019s \nassets, together with its ability to deliver controlling stakes, attract both strategic and financial \ninterest even in challenging business cycles. Consequently, True North has managed to exit \nportfolio companies successfully and provide liquidity to investors despite India\u2019s recent economic \ndownturn. \n \n22.  Reporting arrangements. True North VI will be required to provide ADB with quarterly \nunaudited reports, audited financial statements, annual reports, a fund overview, an annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring report, a portfolio overview, and summary information on \neach portfolio company\u2019s performance. ADB will review this information and follow up with the \nmanager if more information or clarification is needed. If the information received from the \nmanager raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in True North VI, ADB \ncould decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed reviews. \n \n23.  True North VI will be required to adopt an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) before the first disbursement \nand to report annually on environmental and social safeguard issues. ADB will monitor the timing \nand quality of the ESMS reports and offer guidance if the designated partners require clarification \non ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n24.  Environmental and social standard framework. True North\u2019s existing environmental \nand social policies were created to satisfy CDC Group\u2019s requirements as an investor in Fund II \nand Fund III, and these policies have not changed.11 As part of ADB\u2019s investment, True North has \n                                                \n11  CDC Group is a United Kingdom development finance institution that is wholly owned by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom. \n ", "6 \ncommitted to enhancing and expanding its environmental and social policies and manuals to \nincorporate an ESMS compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n25.  Anti-money laundering and integrity framework. True North VI is subject to the AML \nand know-your-customer requirements of SEBI. As part of ADB\u2019s proposed investment in the \nfund, True North has committed to expanding True North VI\u2019s AML and integrity framework, \nincluding enhancing AML and integrity requirements for screening investors of True North VI and \nthe sellers and buyers of portfolio investments.12 \n \n26.  Diversifying investor base. True North\u2019s philosophy is to maintain a diversified, well-\nbalanced institutional investor base. It seeks funding from ADB to benefit from its longstanding \npresence  in  Asia,  its  network  and  operational  experience,  and  its  status  as  a  multilateral \ndevelopment financial institution. With True North VI expected to be True North\u2019s largest fund to \ndate, ADB\u2019s participation would also help the fund reach its target capitalization. \n \n27.  Cofinancing opportunities. True North hopes to benefit from ADB\u2019s ability to provide \ndebt and equity financing directly to its portfolio companies. In addition to providing capital from \nits own balance sheet and technical assistance, ADB can also help mobilize additional financing \nfrom third-party sources. \n \nE.  Risks \n28.

Private  equity  funding  for  middle-market  companies  in  India  increased, \ncontributing to economic growth, the creation of quality jobs, and improved business efficiency \nand transparency. Access to and affordability of basic services increased, including banking, \ninsurance, financial services, and health care. Viability of business models based on sound social \npractices demonstrated.  \n \n38.  Outcome. The financial and social sustainability of private equity investments in Indian \nmiddle-market companies has been demonstrated. Investee companies supported by True North \nVI are expected to yield an aggregate IRR of at least 8%, increasing the employment generated \nand the contributions to government revenues through tax payments. \n \n39.  Outputs. True North VI is established and capital invested. Final closing is expected by \nthe second quarter of 2018, with the successful deployment of the committed capital among at \nleast eight companies targeted by 2025. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n40.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Finance sector development is \none of the five core areas of ADB\u2019s operations. The proposed investment also aligns well with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which seeks to promote inclusive economic growth in developing member \ncountries through the development of the private sector.13 As control investors in India\u2019s middle \nmarket segment, True North actively manages its investee companies to grow their businesses \nsustainably, thereby contributing to capital mobilization, job creation, and private sector growth. \nThe proposed investment is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 \nfor India, which highlights investment in financial infrastructure, including investment funds, as a \npriority area.14 \n  \n41.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The ADB Operational \nPlan for Health, 2015\u20132020 strongly supports private sector approaches to address quality, \nefficiency, and financing issues in the health sector.15 By investing in True North VI, ADB is \npartnering with a leading investment manager in India that has identified health care as one of its \ncore target sectors. Health care investments made by the fund are expected to improve the \nquality,  efficiency,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  health  services  and  delivery  modalities  for \nunderserved populations in India. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n42.  Considering the environment and social impacts and risks of the likely future portfolio of \nTrue North VI, the investment is classified category FI for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Although  the  fund\u2019s  focus  is  to  finance  companies \noperating in sectors such as finance, health care, and consumer and technology products and \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2014.

However, it does \nnot envisage investing in sectors that would be categorized high risk for environment and social \nimpact. Should it ever support a category A project (for environment, involuntary resettlement, or \nindigenous peoples), ADB would exercise its right to opt out of funding the investment. \n \n43.  True North will be required to (i) build upon its current practices and procedures; (ii) update \nand expand its policies and manuals to incorporate an environmental, health and safety, and \nsocial management system commensurate with the level of potential environment and social \nimpacts and risks of its likely portfolio; and (iii) ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The ESMS will be developed prior to the first disbursement and will include (but not \nbe limited to) screening procedures for categorizing projects based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. Requests for each subsequent disbursement for a proposed investment \nwill require ADB\u2019s affirmation and concurrence on the proposed categorization and adequacy of \nenvironmental and social due diligence documentation. \n \n44.
