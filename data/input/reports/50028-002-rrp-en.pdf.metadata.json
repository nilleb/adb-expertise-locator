THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Solomon Islands; and (ii) proposed policy-based grants to the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands (RMI), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Kingdom of Tonga, \nand Solomon Islands for the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2). \n \n2.   The  proposed  contingent  disaster  financing  program  will  improve  resilience  of  the \nparticipating Asian Development Bank (ADB) Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) to \ndisasters triggered by natural hazards. It will support policy actions in disaster risk management \n(DRM) and provide a source of financing for timely disaster response and early recovery. The \nprogram is the second phase of the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, approved in December \n2017 for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu.1 It will provide a second round of contingent financing for \nTonga and add three new countries (RMI, FSM, and Solomon Islands) to the program.2  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Disaster risk in the Pacific. ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are highly exposed to many different \ntypes of natural hazards, including tropical cyclones, earthquakes, storm surges, tsunamis, \nvolcanic eruptions, floods, and droughts. The region also experiences a disproportionately high \nshare of global disaster impacts relative to its economic and demographic size. Disaster risk is \nincreasing because of climate change, poor development planning, unplanned urbanization, and \necosystem decline. Climate change can exacerbate disaster risk by increasing the intensity or \nfrequency of extreme weather events. Rising sea levels are also speeding erosion rates and \nincreasing the risk of more destructive storm surges. Rising ocean temperatures and ocean \nacidification are destroying the coral reefs that form natural coastal barriers.  \n \n4.  Due to the small size of their economies and limited access to international financial \nmarkets, most Pacific DMCs have limited resources and capacity to invest in disaster risk \nreduction (DRR) and to facilitate timely recovery and reconstruction after a disaster. Pacific DMCs \nface further challenges due to their remote locations and geographical features. Many have \nrelatively small populations that are widely dispersed over several islands, many of which are \nisolated and difficult to reach in times of a disaster. These factors contribute to the relatively high \ncost of disaster response and reconstruction. Delays in response and early recovery exacerbate \nthe  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of  disasters,  worsen  their  ultimate  impacts,  and \ncompromise  long-term  fiscal  balances.  Disasters  can  erode  many  years  of  economic \ndevelopment  gains  by  damaging  critical  infrastructure,  disrupting  services,  and  diverting \nresources from development spending to disaster response and reconstruction. \n \n5.  Governments\u2019  strategies.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risks  posed  by  disasters,  all \nparticipating DMCs have taken important steps to improve disaster resilience. DRM objectives \nare generally well defined within these governments\u2019 policies and plans. All countries define legal \nresponsibilities for DRM and procedures for declaring a state of emergency or disaster. All have \nsome  financial  arrangements  in  place  for  disaster  response,  including  annual  contingency \nbudgets or sovereign disaster insurance. Building disaster resilience requires actions on many \nfronts, however, and the countries remain constrained by capacity and competing priorities.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. Regional: Pacific Disaster Resilience Program. \n2  Tonga had contingent financing under Phase 1 that was already fully disbursed. ", "2 \n6.  The governments recognize that more effort is required to strengthen the policy and \ninstitutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for post-disaster response and early \nrecovery at national and local levels. National and local disaster management arrangements can \nbe strengthened by defining roles, responsibilities, and standard operating procedures to follow \nduring disasters. DRM capacity is particularly weak at local level, and regular capacity building or \ndrills are required to ensure successful implementation of DRM plans during disasters. National \nDRM committees and councils typically meet only in the event of major disasters, but DRR \nincreasingly is covered by climate change working groups or committees that typically meet more \nfrequently. Coordination at national level can be further enhanced through regular joint meetings \nof the DRM and climate change committees.  \n \n7.  The  national  disaster  management  offices  are  often  underfunded  and  have  limited \ncapacity to respond to disasters. Improved access to and management of climate and disaster \nfinance is critical for achieving the DMCs\u2019 strategic outcomes related to DRM and climate change \nadaptation. Prioritizing and expanding investments in DRM and climate change adaptation could \nbe further strengthened through developing climate change strategies and action plans, further \nstrengthening sector plans by incorporating climate- and disaster-resilience considerations, and \nimproving the resilience of physical assets. Supporting better use of climate and disaster finance \nmay  require  strengthening  policies  and  plans,  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and \nexpenditure, institutions and human capacity, gender and social inclusion, and development \neffectiveness.   \n \n8.  In the event of a significant disaster, governments typically have insufficient resources \nthrough budget contingency lines, reserves, and insurance to meet immediate post-disaster \nfinancing needs. Instead, they rely heavily on budget reallocations, which can take some time to \nsecure and often redirect funds away from development priorities.  \n \n9.  Development  partner  support.  In  the  aftermath  of  disasters  in  the  Pacific,  major \ndevelopment partners, including the governments of Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan, New Zealand, and the United States, usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, \nincluding in-kind support and financing through humanitarian nongovernment organizations. The \nUnited Nations\u2019 Pacific Humanitarian Team mobilizes relief and technical support from several \noffices in the region. Development partners, including ADB, also provide financing to support \nreconstruction. Major development partners and regional organizations are actively supporting \nimplementation of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific 2017\u20132030.3 \n \n10.  The  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative  (PCRAFI)  was \noriginally established in 2007 as a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, the World Bank, and \nADB.4 Building on the World Bank\u2019s catastrophe insurance initiative under the PCRAFI, the Pacific \nCatastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) was established to provide disaster risk insurance \nto member countries in the Pacific region. PCRIC is a captive insurance company owned by the \nPCRAFI Foundation.5 It was established by legal statute in the Cook Islands in 2016. Four \ncountries currently have parametric sovereign disaster insurance cover through PCRIC: the Cook \nIslands, RMI, Samoa, and Tonga. The World Bank\u2019s Pacific Resilience Program is carrying out \ncomplementary DRM work and has secured some premium financing for PCRIC insurance. \n \n                                                \n3  Pacific Community. 2016. Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, 2017\u20132030. Suva. \n4  World Bank. 2017. PCRAFI: Furthering Disaster Risk Financing in the Pacific Project. Washington, DC. \n5  The Foundation is governed by a Council of Members that currently consists of the member countries and the four \ncontributing donors (Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US). \n ", "3 \n11.  ADB  attaches  significant  importance  to  DRM  in  the  Pacific,  and  it  has  provided \nconsiderable loans, grants, and technical assistance (TA) for post-disaster response, early \nrecovery,  and  reconstruction. This support  has  progressively  broadened from  post-disaster \nassistance to proactive DRR through a range of financing mechanisms. ADB provides dedicated \nfunding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development Fund (ADF) \n12  DRR  financing  mechanism,  and  ADB  often  plays  a  key  role  in  post-disaster  needs \nassessments. For the post-disaster humanitarian response phase, ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster \nResponse Fund, a dedicated quick-disbursing instrument, can provide grants up to $3.0 million \nper event within 1 week of a disaster.6 Additional concessional funds can be accessed through \nthe ADF Disaster Response Facility (DRF) for the early recovery and reconstruction phases. \n  \n12.  Since 2004, ADB has offered an emergency assistance loans instrument with extended \ngrace  and  repayment  periods,  increased  retroactive  financing,  lower  interest  rates,  and \nstreamlined processing requirements, thereby facilitating the approval of fast-tracked assistance \nfor early recovery purposes. Nevertheless, emergency assistance loans can still take 3 months \nor  more  to  process,  and  reconstruction  loans  under  normal  lending  modalities  can  take \nsignificantly longer. Therefore, ADB has piloted contingent financing for disasters in the Cook \nIslands and Palau, and through the first phase of the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program in \nSamoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu, as a mechanism to provide more timely post-disaster financing \nthrough stand-alone, single-tranche, policy-based loans and grants.7 On 1 August 2019, ADB \nformally adopted contingent disaster financing as an option under its policy-based lending policy.8  \n13.  Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 1). In December 2017, ADB approved the \nPacific Disaster Resilience Program for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Following Cyclone Gita in \nFebruary 2018, Tonga drew down its available financing ($6.0 million) within a few days following \nthe disaster.9 Cyclone Gita provided an immediate proof of concept for the program, and the \nlessons learned have been reflected in the design of Phase 2. The cyclone demonstrated that the \nvarious instruments can be complementary in responding to a single disaster event. In addition \nto the $6.0 million under Phase 1, Tonga also received an insurance payout of $3.5 million from \nPCRIC. It also accessed the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund ($1.0 million)10 and the ADF \nDRF. Of the $8.8 million available for Tonga under the DRF, $6.8 million was allocated for ADB\u2019s \nCyclone Gita Recovery Project to reconstruct and climate- and disaster-proof the electricity \nnetwork of Nuku\u2019alofa.11 Another $2.0 million was allocated for this Phase 2 of the program. \n \n14.  Although the overall response to Cyclone Gita was a success, a notable obstacle to \nefficient cross-cluster response was the inefficient gathering of needs assessment information. \nPoor clarity of roles and responsibilities due to weak cluster standard operating procedures and \nterms of reference also created significant confusion, gaps, and overlap between the responses \nof  individual  clusters.  Inefficiencies  in  prioritizing  response  needs  and  budget  allocation \nhighlighted the importance of effective PFM systems for disasters. Phase 2 policy matrixes and \npost-program partnership frameworks (PPPFs) include actions on strengthening post-disaster \nneeds assessment capacities and PFM of disaster response and recovery. \n                                                \n6  From establishment of the APDRF in 2009 until March 2019, the Pacific has received 15 APDRF grants totaling \n$10.1 million.  \n7  ADB.

Phase 1 includes attached regional TA that will be expanded to include the new countries \nunder Phase 2 (pending approval of this program).12 The TA has started country-level support to \nstrengthen the policy environment and institutional arrangements for DRM through strengthening \npost-disaster  budget  execution  capabilities,  rapid  resource  mobilization,  appropriation  and \ndisbursement in the event of a disaster, and effective prioritization of use of funds. Gender \nconsiderations are mainstreamed in the country-level support under the TA. \n \n16.  To supplement the available contingent disaster financing, options are being assessed \nunder the TA attached to Phase 1 for a potential sustainable multi-country mechanism to provide \ncontingent disaster financing. The potential regional mechanism would hold the countries\u2019 funds \nalong  with  any  additional  development  partner  funds,  and  each  country\u2019s  share  could  be \nwithdrawn quickly upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster. The mechanism would \nallow funds to be replenished, additional countries to join, and other donors to contribute to the \ncontingent funds. Linking the mechanism  to an existing regional entity would offer several \nbenefits, including economies of scale in funds management and the governance mechanism, \nstrengthening regional ownership, and allowing countries to select optimal combinations of \ndisaster financing instruments. This assessment is expected to continue over the next 12\u201324 \nmonths and involve extensive participation by all stakeholders.  \n \n17.  The proposed approach. As with the first phase, Phase 2 of the program provides Pacific \nDMCs with a source of rapidly disbursing financing for response and early recovery activities \nfollowing disaster events caused by natural hazards. Eligibility to withdraw loan and grant \nproceeds is based on achieving prior disaster resilience-related policy actions, but disbursements \nwill be triggered when a state of disaster or emergency is declared. The country-specific policy \nactions have reduced the underlying disaster risk and enhanced disaster preparedness. Each \ngovernment has also agreed upon an ongoing PPPF to strengthen DRM performance. The DMCs \nface similar DRM challenges and will benefit greatly from a regional approach whereby good \npractices are shared. The program will support coordination and cooperation both between Pacific \nDMCs and with development partners on disaster risk financing arrangements and policy reform \ndiscussions. The program will complement disaster risk financing instruments currently in use by \nthe participating governments, including annual contingency budgets, national disaster funds, \nparametric disaster insurance, and traditional indemnity insurance.  \n \n18.  The program is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, specifically its operational priority C on \nTackling  Climate  Change,  Building  Climate  and  Disaster  Resilience,  and  Enhancing \nEnvironmental Sustainability, which supports strengthening DMCs\u2019 financial preparedness for \ndisaster response through policy-based contingent financing.13 The program is consistent with the \nobjectives  of  the  ADB  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u22122020,  which  serves  as  ADB\u2019s  operational \nframework for the Pacific region, and the overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller \nPacific DMCs, including RMI, FSM, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.14 The Pacific Approach focuses \non three strategic areas, one of which is managing risks, and highlights the needs to (i) expand \nADB\u2019s work in climate change and DRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster \npreparedness, address vulnerability, and build resilience; and (iii) pursue a more programmatic \nand regional approach to financing climate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n \n ", "5 \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n19.  Each participating DMC has satisfied its policy actions to strengthen the resilience of \ninstitutions and communities through three reform areas under Phase 2, as outlined below:15 \n \n20.  Reform area 1: Policy, governance, and institutional arrangements for disaster risk \nmanagement strengthened. All four countries have made significant progress in their policies \nand plans for climate change and DRM. RMI was the first country globally to submit new, binding \nclimate targets to the United Nations in the Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), \nincluding commitment to produce a National Adaptation Plan for climate and disaster resilience, \nand Adaptation Communications.16 RMI has also recently approved a new Climate Change \nStrategy, with focus areas including coastal resilience; strengthening DRM in the outer islands; \nand contingency and emergency response.17 FSM has finalized a national disaster and climate \nfinancing assessment that includes recommendations and an action plan on policies, PFM and \nexpenditure, institutions and human capacity, gender and social inclusion, and development \neffectiveness. FSM also approved a country program strategy for climate change investments \nand strengthened its disaster office through significant increase in funding and staffing.18  \n \n21.  In Solomon Islands, DRM arrangements have been strengthened at national and local \nlevels through the approval of a new Disaster Management Plan, which sets the arrangements \nfor  DRM  and  establishes  processes  for  implementation  and  capacity  development. 19  It \nestablishes a framework for climate- and disaster-resilient development within sector planning \nand  reinforces  government  leadership  in  DRM  while  defining  roles  for  communities, \nnongovernment organizations, and the private sector. Solomon Islands has also strengthened \nlocal arrangements for DRM by establishing provincial boards to support implementation of local \nplans. Since Phase 1\u2019s approval, Tonga has also made significant progress on DRM. The new \nactions under Phase 2 for Tonga include approval of a Second Joint National Action Plan on \nclimate  change  adaptation  and  DRM,  which  includes  specific  objectives  on mainstreaming \nresilience, research, monitoring, and regional cooperation.20 A Cyclone Gita Lessons Learned \nReport examines the limitations of the overarching regulatory and policy framework and offers \ndetailed recommendations and action plan within the cluster system.21 \n \n22.  Reform area 2: DRM investment planning processes and tools improved. Countries \nhave prepared new sector strategies or policies that have mainstreamed climate- and disaster-\nresilience  actions  within  sector  investment  priorities,  such  as  the  Greater  Honiara  Urban \nDevelopment Strategy and Action Plan22 and the national urban policy for Solomon Islands, and \nthe national and state level energy master plans for FSM. The National Environment Management \nStrategy for RMI includes targets on climate change and DRM,23 and the RMI Environmental \nProtection Agency Strategic Plan considers resilient coastal zones as one of its focus areas.24 \nRMI also developed an NDC implementation plan that outlines immediate actions on climate \nchange and DRM, as well as fundamental cross-cutting areas, including gender.  \n                                                \n15 The policy actions and areas of program monitoring are described in Appendixes 4, 6, 8, and 10. \n16 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2018.

Participating countries have also completed national- or state-level tabletop exercises or \nspecific  disaster  drills  to  develop  capacities  at  all  levels  and  help  ensure  successful \nimplementation of DRM plans during disasters. FSM and Solomon Islands have strengthened the \ncoordination between disaster and climate change committees through regular joint meetings. \nFSM has prepared community-level disaster plans. Tonga has approved a housing reconstruction \nstrategy incorporating lessons learned from past disasters (in particular Cyclone Gita), revised its \nbuilding codes to include higher standards of disaster resilience, and developed an emergency \ncontingency  plan  covering  DRM  and  PFM  arrangements  to  enable  both  the  national  and \nsubnational governments to provide timely and effective response to disasters.  \n \n24.  Reform area 3: Disaster risk financing expanded. The most cost-effective way of \nfinancing disaster response is through a range of tools within a common framework addressing \ndifferent layers of risk. The governments are committed to active contingency planning to cover \ndifferent risk layers in their country contexts. All four countries have committed funds to national \nemergency or disaster funds for very low layers of risk and have procedures in place for some \npost-disaster budget reallocation. RMI and Tonga participate in the PCRAFI insurance scheme, \nwhich provides parametric insurance cover against higher risk layers involving tropical cyclones, \nearthquakes, and/or tsunamis, and they have committed government funds for the insurance \npremium. RMI has committed to a gender-sensitive climate budgeting process. Solomon Islands \nhas set up a specific climate and disaster finance unit in its Ministry of Finance and Treasury to \nstrengthen PFM of disasters and for activities related to climate and disaster resilience.  \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform  \n \n25.  The impact of the program is aligned with Goal 1 (Strengthened integrated adaptation and \nrisk reduction to enhance resilience to climate change and disasters) and Goal 3 (Strengthened \ndisaster preparedness, response and recovery) of the Framework for Resilient Development in \nthe Pacific 2017\u20132030 (footnote 3). It will only be possible to quantify the full economic impact of \nthe policy actions after a disaster, because the benefits or costs avoided will be determined by \nthe scale and type of disaster and geographical area of impact. The program will provide a timely \nand predictable source of post-disaster financing, that will facilitate rapid decision making and \nimplementation of priority actions and reduce the indirect economic and social costs of direct \nphysical losses.  \n \n26.  The policy actions will ultimately result in economic benefits. Under reform area 1, these \nwill include reduced loss of lives and property, as well as reduced costs due to shorter business \nand public facility closures. These benefits will result from improved disaster planning and faster \nrestoration of essential infrastructure and services. Under reform area 2, benefits will include \nreduced damage to property, improved public safety, and reduced negative post-disaster health \nimpacts. These will result from improved sector planning; improved response, preparation, and \npublic training; and more resilient infrastructure and assets. In reform area 3, there will be reduced \nopportunity  costs  associated  with  budget  reallocations  and  financial  costs  associated  with \nadditional borrowing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "7 \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  During  the  initial  availability  period  covering  2020\u20132022,  participating  governments\u2019 \noverall development financing needs are estimated to range between 20.6% and 21.1% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per annum, of which from 19.4% to 19.6% of GDP will be mobilized from \nexternal financing, predominantly as grants.25 The post-disaster financing needs have been \ndetermined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- to low-frequency disasters, taking into \naccount resources likely available from domestic and international sources, the need to ensure \nthat  the  countries  maintain  sustainable  levels  of  debt,  and  the  availability  of  concessional \nresources. Although data on historical losses is incomplete, analysis undertaken under the \nPCRAFI indicates that average annual losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis \nalone are equivalent to 2.9% of GDP in FSM, 2.0% of GDP in RMI, 3.0% of GDP in Solomon \nIslands, and 4.3% of GDP in Tonga. In addition, the four countries experience frequent droughts, \nfloods, storm surges, and, in some cases, volcanic eruptions. Examples of damage and loss from \ndisasters in the participating countries include Cyclone Gita in 2018, which caused damage \nequivalent to 38% of GDP in Tonga; severe flooding in 2014, causing damage equivalent to 9% \nof GDP in Solomon Islands; Typhoon Maysak, causing losses equivalent to 4% of GDP in FSM; \nand severe drought in 2016 causing losses of 3% of GDP in RMI. The proposed financing per \ncountry under the program ranges from 0.5% to 3.0% of annual GDP, less than the cost of a \ntypical medium-impact disaster in the Pacific. \n \n28.  The governments have requested (i) grants not exceeding $6.0 million each for RMI, FSM, \nand Tonga and $3.0 million for Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF); and \n(ii) a concessional loan of $3.0 million for Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term and a disbursement-linked \nrepayment schedule, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The indicative financing comprises resources from the concessional \nresources regional pool, countries\u2019 concessional lending and grant allocations; and, in the case \nof Tonga, from the ADF DRF (see Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Financing Plan \nAmount ($ million)  Share of Total \nSource \nRMI  FSM  SOL  Tonga  Total  (%) \n     \nAsian Development Bank          \nCOL PBA (loan)  0  0  1  0  1  4.2 \nCOL regional pool (loan)  0  0  2  0  2  8.3 \nADF PBA (grant)  2  2  1  0  5  20.8 \nADF regional pool (grant)  4  4  2  4  14  58.3 \nADF DRF (grant)  0  0  0  2  2  8.3 \nTotal  6  6  6  6  24  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, COL = concessional ordinary capital resources loan, DRF = Disaster Response \nFacility, FSM = Federated States of Micronesia, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands, PBA = performance-based \nallocation, SOL = Solomon Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n25 Fiscal deficit and external financing figures are gross national income-weighted averages for the four countries. \n \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  Executing  agencies  will  be  the  ministry  of finance  or  equivalent  in  each  country.26 \nImplementing agencies will include ministries responsible for finance, planning, infrastructure, \nclimate change, and DRM. Each participating DMC has country-specific policy actions and \nseparate loan and/or grant agreements. The implementing agencies will implement the PPPF with \nthe support of DRM or climate change committees. The policy actions were implemented after \napproval of the program\u2019s Phase 1, from 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2019.27 The program will be \ncompleted on 31 March 2023, with a renewal option for a second 3-year period. Program renewal \nis subject to reconfirmation as to adequacy of the macroeconomic environment, including an \nupdated International Monetary Fund assessment letter; DMCs\u2019 continued progress toward the \nPPPF; and an updated PPPF with mutually agreed objectives for the subsequent availability \nperiod. Renewal may also be affected by any changes to country classification during the program \nperiod.28 \n \n30.  A withdrawal will be triggered after a government declares a state of disaster or emergency \nfollowing a natural hazard event in accordance with applicable law or practice.29 The government \ncan withdraw the loan and grant proceeds partially or entirely, depending on its assessment of \nthe disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need. Only a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster \nevent, and the request should be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \ndisaster or emergency.30 Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the grant and/or loan availability \nperiod can be disbursed to the respective participating countries under the deferred disbursement \noption, subject to ADB reconfirming the DMCs\u2019 continuation of policy actions and the PPPF \nthrough submission of a progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes \nfor eligible items.31 Proceeds of the policy-based loans and grants will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nperiodically  monitor  continuing  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  and  PPPF  during  the \navailability period. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n31.  The program is classified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous people. Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none \nof the activities will result in or lead to any physical works that could create environmental or social \nimpacts, physical or economic displacement, or involuntary resettlement. The activities will not \nnegatively affect indigenous peoples. Stakeholder dialogue was carried out during the program \ndesign and will continue during implementation. The policy actions will improve the participating \ncountries\u2019 ability to maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster and to initiate relief \nand recovery efforts with minimum delay, thereby mitigating the immediate economic and social \nimpacts of a disaster. Implementation of the policy actions is expected to continue to strengthen \nexisting social protection arrangements, helping to ensure that communities and vulnerable \n                                                \n26 Ministry of Finance of RMI, Department of Finance and Administration of FSM, Ministry of Finance and Treasury of \nSolomon Islands, and Ministry of Finance of Tonga. \n27 Policy actions were identified and their implementation encouraged through policy dialogue, which has been \nongoing since 2017 with some support from various ongoing TA. \n28 Footnote 8, paragraph 26. \n29 Government of RMI. 1987.

The program is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d Women are impacted by \ndisasters in different and often overlooked ways. The program will directly benefit women by \nensuring gender is a core component of key strategic and policy documents. National climate \nchange strategies, emergency management plans, and sector policies (including the RMI National \nEnvironment  Management  Strategy,  Solomon  Islands  Greater  Honiara  Urban  Development \nStrategy and Action Plan, and the FSM National Energy Master Plan) include gender analysis \nand actions. National strategies outline the importance of women\u2019s participation in DRM, include \nquotas to increase women\u2019s participation in decision-making, and commit to incorporate gender \nanalysis in all stages of DRM initiatives. Actions such as appointing women to the Solomon \nIslands provincial boards and ensuring women are involved in disaster and climate change \ncommittees and working groups will support women\u2019s representation in decision-making roles. \nThe  program  supports  gender-responsive  disaster  risk  financing  by  committing  to  gender-\nsensitive budgeting processes in NDC implementation plan (RMI) and ensuring that gender equity \nis a core guiding principle in strategies for accessing climate change financing (FSM).   \n \n33.  Coordinating disaster responses, including the support offered by donors and civil society \norganizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose significant administrative \nchallenges. Therefore, government absorption capacities are often stretched in the aftermath of \ndisaster events. The regional TA under Phase 1, which will be expanded to the new countries, is \nprioritizing capacity development focused on financing and budgetary issues, including post-\ndisaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that all countries participating in the program \nhave adequate systems in place to use program resources in an effective, accountable, and \ntransparent manner.  \n \n34.  Risks  to  program  implementation  are  related  to  possible  external  shocks  on  the \neconomies and capacity constraints of the government agencies, including constraints in PFM \nsystems. These risks will be managed partially through support for capacity development of \ngovernment counterparts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient action is taken on recommendations  The governments have actively strengthened PFM \nto improve financial management procedures  more broadly, and the Phase 1 TA will provide \nfor disaster response.a  support to address weaknesses identified in PFM. \nExternal shocks (e.g., disasters and economic  Development partners support the governments to \ndownturns) damage the economies.  improve resilience to economic shocks. \nGovernment agencies lack capacity to  The Phase 1 TA and support from other partners will \nimplement the DRM actions.  develop the capacity of government counterparts.  \nStaff constraints or shifting priorities delay  Periodic monitoring is conducted to assess and \nimplementation of DRM actions.  report on progress of the PPPF, and Phase 1 TA will \nsupport actions to further strengthen DRM. \nDRM = disaster risk management, PFM = public financial management, PPPF = post-program partnership framework, \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \na Several completed plans or strategies under the reform areas include some recommendations on financial \nmanagement procedures during disasters. \n                                                \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n35.  The Debt Sustainability Analysis for the Solomon Islands, the only country under Phase 2 \naccessing loan resources, indicates that the risk of external debt distress remains moderate, \nthough  it  notes  a  high  vulnerability  to  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards. 33 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernments and executing agencies.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n36.  The governments have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nand grant agreements.
