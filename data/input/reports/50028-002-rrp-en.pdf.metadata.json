It will support policy actions in disaster risk management \n(DRM)  and provide  a  source  of  financing for timely  disaster  response  and early  recovery. The \nprogram is the second phase of the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, approved in December \n2017 for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu.1 It will provide a second round of contingent financing for \nTonga and add three new countries (RMI, FSM, and Solomon Islands) to the program.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDisaster risk in the Pacific. ADB\u2019s Pacific DMCs are highly exposed to many different \ntypes  of  natural  hazards,  including  tropical  cyclones,  earthquakes,  storm  surges,  tsunamis, \nvolcanic eruptions, floods, and droughts. The region also experiences a disproportionately high \nshare of global disaster impacts relative to its economic and demographic size. Disaster risk is \nincreasing because of climate change, poor development planning, unplanned urbanization, and \necosystem  decline.  Climate change can  exacerbate disaster risk  by  increasing  the  intensity  or \nfrequency  of  extreme  weather  events.  Rising  sea  levels  are  also  speeding  erosion  rates  and \nincreasing  the  risk  of  more  destructive  storm  surges.  Rising  ocean  temperatures  and  ocean \nacidification are destroying the coral reefs that form natural coastal barriers.  \n \n4. \nDue  to  the  small  size  of  their  economies  and  limited  access  to  international  financial \nmarkets,  most  Pacific  DMCs  have  limited  resources  and  capacity  to  invest  in  disaster  risk \nreduction (DRR) and to facilitate timely recovery and reconstruction after a disaster. Pacific DMCs \nface  further  challenges  due  to  their  remote  locations  and  geographical  features.  Many  have \nrelatively  small  populations  that  are  widely  dispersed  over  several  islands,  many  of  which  are \nisolated and difficult to reach in times of a disaster. These factors contribute to the relatively high \ncost of disaster response and reconstruction. Delays in response and early recovery exacerbate \nthe  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of  disasters,  worsen  their  ultimate  impacts,  and \ncompromise  long-term  fiscal  balances.  Disasters  can  erode  many  years  of  economic \ndevelopment  gains  by  damaging  critical  infrastructure,  disrupting  services,  and  diverting \nresources from development spending to disaster response and reconstruction. \n \n5. \nGovernments\u2019  strategies.  To  mitigate  the  economic  risks  posed  by  disasters,  all \nparticipating DMCs  have  taken  important steps  to improve disaster  resilience.  DRM  objectives \nare generally well defined within these governments\u2019 policies and plans. All countries define legal \nresponsibilities for DRM and procedures for declaring a state of emergency or disaster. All have \nsome  financial  arrangements  in  place  for  disaster  response,  including  annual  contingency \nbudgets or sovereign disaster insurance. Building disaster resilience requires actions on many \nfronts, however, and the countries remain constrained by capacity and competing priorities.  \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. Regional: Pacific Disaster Resilience Program. \n2  Tonga had contingent financing under Phase 1 that was already fully disbursed. \n\n\fThe  governments  recognize  that  more  effort  is  required  to  strengthen  the  policy  and \n6. \ninstitutional arrangements for DRM, including the capacity for post-disaster response and early \nrecovery at national and local levels. National and local disaster management arrangements can \nbe strengthened by defining roles, responsibilities, and standard operating procedures to follow \nduring disasters. DRM capacity is particularly weak at local level, and regular capacity building or \ndrills are required to ensure successful implementation of DRM plans during disasters. National \nDRM  committees  and  councils  typically  meet  only  in  the  event  of  major  disasters,  but  DRR \nincreasingly is covered by climate change working groups or committees that typically meet more \nfrequently. Coordination at national level can be further enhanced through regular joint meetings \nof the DRM and climate change committees.  \n \n7. \nThe  national  disaster  management  offices  are  often  underfunded  and  have  limited \ncapacity to respond to disasters. Improved access to and management of climate and disaster \nfinance is critical for achieving the DMCs\u2019 strategic outcomes related to DRM and climate change \nadaptation. Prioritizing and expanding investments in DRM and climate change adaptation could \nbe further strengthened through developing climate change strategies and action plans, further \nstrengthening sector plans by incorporating climate- and disaster-resilience considerations, and \nimproving the resilience of physical assets. Supporting better use of climate and disaster finance \nmay  require  strengthening  policies  and  plans,  public  financial  management  (PFM)  and \nexpenditure,  institutions  and  human  capacity,  gender  and  social  inclusion,  and  development \neffectiveness.   \n \n8. \nIn  the  event  of  a  significant  disaster,  governments  typically  have  insufficient  resources \nthrough  budget  contingency  lines,  reserves,  and  insurance  to  meet  immediate  post-disaster \nfinancing needs. Instead, they rely heavily on budget reallocations, which can take some time to \nsecure and often redirect funds away from development priorities.  \n \n9. \nDevelopment  partner  support.  In  the  aftermath  of  disasters  in  the  Pacific,  major \ndevelopment partners, including the governments of Australia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan, New Zealand, and the United States, usually move quickly to mobilize immediate relief, \nincluding in-kind support and financing through humanitarian nongovernment organizations. The \nUnited  Nations\u2019  Pacific Humanitarian Team mobilizes relief and  technical  support from several \noffices  in  the  region.  Development  partners,  including  ADB,  also  provide  financing  to  support \nreconstruction.  Major  development  partners  and  regional  organizations  are  actively  supporting \nimplementation of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific 2017\u20132030.3 \n \nThe  Pacific  Catastrophe  Risk  Assessment  and  Financing  Initiative  (PCRAFI)  was \n10. \noriginally established in 2007 as a joint initiative of the Pacific Community, the World Bank, and \nADB.4 Building on the World Bank\u2019s catastrophe insurance initiative under the PCRAFI, the Pacific \nCatastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) was established to provide disaster risk insurance \nto member countries in the Pacific region. PCRIC is a captive insurance company owned by the \nPCRAFI  Foundation. 5 It  was  established  by  legal  statute  in  the  Cook  Islands  in  2016.  Four \ncountries currently have parametric sovereign disaster insurance cover through PCRIC: the Cook \nIslands, RMI, Samoa, and Tonga. The World Bank\u2019s Pacific Resilience Program is carrying out \ncomplementary DRM work and has secured some premium financing for PCRIC insurance. \n \n\n                                                \n3  Pacific Community. 2016. Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, 2017\u20132030. Suva. \n4  World Bank. 2017. PCRAFI: Furthering Disaster Risk Financing in the Pacific Project. Washington, DC. \n5  The Foundation is governed by a Council of Members that currently consists of the member countries and the four \n\ncontributing donors (Germany, Japan, the UK, and the US). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nADB  attaches  significant  importance  to  DRM  in  the  Pacific,  and  it  has  provided \n11. \nconsiderable  loans,  grants,  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  post-disaster  response,  early \nrecovery,  and  reconstruction.  This  support  has  progressively  broadened  from  post-disaster \nassistance to proactive DRR through a range of financing mechanisms. ADB provides dedicated \nfunding to its concessional assistance-only countries through the Asian Development Fund (ADF) \n12  DRR  financing  mechanism,  and  ADB  often  plays  a  key  role  in  post-disaster  needs \nassessments. For the post-disaster humanitarian response phase, ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Disaster \nResponse Fund, a dedicated quick-disbursing instrument, can provide grants up to $3.0 million \nper event within 1 week of a disaster.6 Additional concessional funds can be accessed through \nthe ADF Disaster Response Facility (DRF) for the early recovery and reconstruction phases. \n  \n12. \nSince 2004, ADB has offered an emergency assistance loans instrument with extended \ngrace  and  repayment  periods,  increased  retroactive  financing,  lower  interest  rates,  and \nstreamlined processing requirements, thereby facilitating the approval of fast-tracked assistance \nfor early recovery purposes. Nevertheless, emergency assistance loans can still take 3 months \nor  more  to  process,  and  reconstruction  loans  under  normal  lending  modalities  can  take \nsignificantly  longer.  Therefore,  ADB  has  piloted  contingent  financing  for  disasters  in  the  Cook \nIslands  and  Palau,  and  through  the  first  phase  of  the  Pacific  Disaster  Resilience  Program  in \nSamoa,  Tonga,  and  Tuvalu,  as  a  mechanism  to  provide  more  timely  post-disaster  financing \nthrough  stand-alone,  single-tranche,  policy-based  loans  and  grants.7 On  1  August  2019,  ADB \nformally adopted contingent disaster financing as an option under its policy-based lending policy.8  \n\n13. \nPacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 1). In December 2017, ADB approved the \nPacific Disaster Resilience Program for Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Following Cyclone Gita in \nFebruary 2018, Tonga drew down its available financing ($6.0 million) within a few days following \nthe  disaster.9 Cyclone  Gita  provided  an  immediate  proof  of  concept  for  the  program,  and  the \nlessons learned have been reflected in the design of Phase 2. The cyclone demonstrated that the \nvarious instruments can be complementary in responding to a single disaster event. In addition \nto the $6.0 million under Phase 1, Tonga also received an insurance payout of $3.5 million from \nPCRIC. It also accessed the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund ($1.0 million)10 and the ADF \nDRF. Of the $8.8 million available for Tonga under the DRF, $6.8 million was allocated for ADB\u2019s \nCyclone  Gita  Recovery  Project  to  reconstruct  and  climate-  and  disaster-proof  the  electricity \nnetwork of Nuku\u2019alofa.11 Another $2.0 million was allocated for this Phase 2 of the program. \n \n14. \nAlthough  the  overall  response  to  Cyclone  Gita  was  a  success,  a  notable  obstacle  to \nefficient cross-cluster response was the inefficient gathering of needs assessment information. \nPoor clarity of roles and responsibilities due to weak cluster standard operating procedures and \nterms of reference also created significant confusion, gaps, and overlap between the responses \nof  individual  clusters.  Inefficiencies  in  prioritizing  response  needs  and  budget  allocation \nhighlighted the importance of effective PFM systems for disasters. Phase 2 policy matrixes and \npost-program  partnership  frameworks  (PPPFs)  include  actions  on  strengthening  post-disaster \nneeds assessment capacities and PFM of disaster response and recovery. \n\n                                                \n6  From establishment of the APDRF in 2009 until March 2019, the Pacific has received 15 APDRF grants totaling \n\n7  ADB.

Tonga: Cyclone Gita Recovery Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPhase 1 includes attached regional TA that will be expanded to include the new countries \n15. \nunder Phase 2 (pending approval of this program).12 The TA has started country-level support to \nstrengthen the policy environment and institutional arrangements for DRM through strengthening \npost-disaster  budget  execution  capabilities,  rapid  resource  mobilization,  appropriation  and \ndisbursement  in  the  event  of  a  disaster,  and  effective  prioritization  of  use  of  funds.  Gender \nconsiderations are mainstreamed in the country-level support under the TA. \n \n16. \nTo  supplement  the  available  contingent  disaster  financing,  options  are  being  assessed \nunder the TA attached to Phase 1 for a potential sustainable multi-country mechanism to provide \ncontingent disaster financing. The potential regional mechanism would hold the countries\u2019 funds \nalong  with  any  additional  development  partner  funds,  and  each  country\u2019s  share  could  be \nwithdrawn quickly upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster. The mechanism would \nallow funds to be replenished, additional countries to join, and other donors to contribute to the \ncontingent  funds.  Linking  the  mechanism  to  an  existing  regional  entity  would  offer  several \nbenefits,  including  economies of  scale  in funds management  and the governance mechanism, \nstrengthening  regional  ownership,  and  allowing  countries  to  select  optimal  combinations  of \ndisaster  financing  instruments.  This  assessment  is  expected  to  continue  over  the  next  12\u201324 \nmonths and involve extensive participation by all stakeholders.  \n \n17. \nThe proposed approach. As with the first phase, Phase 2 of the program provides Pacific \nDMCs  with  a  source  of  rapidly  disbursing  financing  for  response  and  early  recovery  activities \nfollowing  disaster  events  caused  by  natural  hazards.  Eligibility  to  withdraw  loan  and  grant \nproceeds is based on achieving prior disaster resilience-related policy actions, but disbursements \nwill be triggered when a state of disaster or emergency is declared. The country-specific policy \nactions  have  reduced  the  underlying  disaster  risk  and  enhanced  disaster  preparedness.  Each \ngovernment has also agreed upon an ongoing PPPF to strengthen DRM performance. The DMCs \nface  similar  DRM  challenges  and  will  benefit  greatly  from  a  regional  approach  whereby  good \npractices are shared. The program will support coordination and cooperation both between Pacific \nDMCs and with development partners on disaster risk financing arrangements and policy reform \ndiscussions. The program will complement disaster risk financing instruments currently in use by \nthe  participating  governments,  including  annual  contingency  budgets,  national  disaster  funds, \nparametric disaster insurance, and traditional indemnity insurance.  \n \n18. \nThe program is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, specifically its operational priority C on \nTackling  Climate  Change,  Building  Climate  and  Disaster  Resilience,  and  Enhancing \nEnvironmental  Sustainability,  which  supports  strengthening  DMCs\u2019  financial  preparedness  for \ndisaster response through policy-based contingent financing.13 The program is consistent with the \nobjectives  of  the  ADB  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u22122020,  which  serves  as  ADB\u2019s  operational \nframework for the Pacific region, and the overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller \nPacific DMCs, including RMI, FSM, Solomon Islands, and Tonga.14 The Pacific Approach focuses \non three strategic areas, one of which is managing risks, and highlights the needs to (i) expand \nADB\u2019s work in climate change and DRM; (ii) introduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster \npreparedness, address vulnerability, and build resilience; and (iii) pursue a more programmatic \nand regional approach to financing climate change and DRM initiatives in the Pacific region. \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

All four countries have made significant progress in their policies \nand plans for climate change and DRM. RMI was the first country globally to submit new, binding \nclimate targets to the United Nations in the Second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), \nincluding commitment to produce a National Adaptation Plan for climate and disaster resilience, \nand  Adaptation  Communications. 16 RMI  has  also  recently  approved  a  new  Climate  Change \nStrategy, with focus areas including coastal resilience; strengthening DRM in the outer islands; \nand contingency and emergency response.17 FSM has finalized a national disaster and climate \nfinancing assessment that includes recommendations and an action plan on policies, PFM and \nexpenditure,  institutions  and  human  capacity,  gender  and  social  inclusion,  and  development \neffectiveness.  FSM  also  approved  a  country  program  strategy  for  climate  change  investments \nand strengthened its disaster office through significant increase in funding and staffing.18  \n \n21. \nIn  Solomon  Islands,  DRM  arrangements  have  been  strengthened  at  national  and  local \nlevels through the approval of a new Disaster Management Plan, which sets the arrangements \nfor  DRM  and  establishes  processes  for  implementation  and  capacity  development. 19  It \nestablishes  a framework  for  climate-  and  disaster-resilient  development  within  sector  planning \nand  reinforces  government \nfor  communities, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and the  private  sector.  Solomon Islands has  also  strengthened \nlocal arrangements for DRM by establishing provincial boards to support implementation of local \nplans. Since Phase 1\u2019s approval, Tonga has also made significant progress on DRM. The new \nactions  under  Phase  2  for  Tonga  include  approval  of  a  Second  Joint  National  Action  Plan  on \nclimate  change  adaptation  and  DRM,  which  includes  specific  objectives  on  mainstreaming \nresilience,  research,  monitoring,  and  regional  cooperation.20 A  Cyclone  Gita  Lessons  Learned \nReport  examines the  limitations of the  overarching  regulatory  and  policy  framework  and  offers \ndetailed recommendations and action plan within the cluster system.21 \n \nReform area 2: DRM investment planning processes and tools improved. Countries \n22. \nhave prepared new sector strategies or policies that have mainstreamed climate- and disaster-\nresilience  actions  within  sector  investment  priorities,  such  as  the  Greater  Honiara  Urban \nDevelopment Strategy and Action Plan22 and the national urban policy for Solomon Islands, and \nthe national and state level energy master plans for FSM. The National Environment Management \nStrategy  for  RMI  includes  targets  on  climate  change  and  DRM,23 and  the  RMI  Environmental \nProtection Agency Strategic Plan considers resilient coastal zones as one of its focus areas.24 \nRMI  also  developed  an  NDC  implementation  plan  that  outlines  immediate  actions  on  climate \nchange and DRM, as well as fundamental cross-cutting areas, including gender.  \n                                                \n15 The policy actions and areas of program monitoring are described in Appendixes 4, 6, 8, and 10. \n16 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2018.

FSM and Solomon Islands have strengthened the \ncoordination  between  disaster  and  climate  change  committees  through  regular  joint  meetings. \nFSM has prepared community-level disaster plans. Tonga has approved a housing reconstruction \nstrategy incorporating lessons learned from past disasters (in particular Cyclone Gita), revised its \nbuilding codes to include higher standards of disaster resilience, and developed an emergency \ncontingency  plan  covering  DRM  and  PFM  arrangements  to  enable  both  the  national  and \nsubnational governments to provide timely and effective response to disasters.  \n \n24. \nReform  area  3:  Disaster  risk  financing  expanded.  The  most  cost-effective  way  of \nfinancing disaster response is through a range of tools within a common framework addressing \ndifferent layers of risk. The governments are committed to active contingency planning to cover \ndifferent risk layers in their country contexts. All four countries have committed funds to national \nemergency or disaster funds for very low layers of risk and have procedures in place for some \npost-disaster budget reallocation. RMI and Tonga participate in the PCRAFI insurance scheme, \nwhich provides parametric insurance cover against higher risk layers involving tropical cyclones, \nearthquakes,  and/or  tsunamis,  and  they  have  committed  government  funds  for  the  insurance \npremium. RMI has committed to a gender-sensitive climate budgeting process. Solomon Islands \nhas set up a specific climate and disaster finance unit in its Ministry of Finance and Treasury to \nstrengthen PFM of disasters and for activities related to climate and disaster resilience.  \n \nC. \n \nThe impact of the program is aligned with Goal 1 (Strengthened integrated adaptation and \n25. \nrisk reduction to enhance resilience to climate change and disasters) and Goal 3 (Strengthened \ndisaster preparedness, response and recovery) of the Framework for Resilient Development in \nthe Pacific 2017\u20132030 (footnote 3). It will only be possible to quantify the full economic impact of \nthe policy actions after a disaster, because the benefits or costs avoided will be determined by \nthe scale and type of disaster and geographical area of impact. The program will provide a timely \nand  predictable  source of  post-disaster  financing,  that  will  facilitate  rapid  decision  making  and \nimplementation  of  priority  actions  and  reduce  the  indirect  economic  and  social  costs  of  direct \nphysical losses.  \n \n26. \nThe policy actions will ultimately result in economic benefits. Under reform area 1, these \nwill include reduced loss of lives and property, as well as reduced costs due to shorter business \nand public facility closures. These benefits will result from improved disaster planning and faster \nrestoration  of  essential  infrastructure  and  services.  Under  reform  area  2,  benefits  will  include \nreduced damage to property, improved public safety, and reduced negative post-disaster health \nimpacts. These will result from improved sector planning; improved response, preparation, and \npublic training; and more resilient infrastructure and assets. In reform area 3, there will be reduced \nopportunity  costs  associated  with  budget  reallocations  and  financial  costs  associated  with \nadditional borrowing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nD. \n \n27. \nDuring  the  initial  availability  period  covering  2020\u20132022,  participating  governments\u2019 \noverall development financing needs are estimated to range between 20.6% and 21.1% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per annum, of which from 19.4% to 19.6% of GDP will be mobilized from \nexternal  financing,  predominantly  as  grants. 25 The  post-disaster  financing  needs  have  been \ndetermined based on the likely fiscal impact of medium- to low-frequency disasters, taking into \naccount resources likely available from domestic and international sources, the need to ensure \nthat  the  countries  maintain  sustainable  levels  of  debt,  and  the  availability  of  concessional \nresources.  Although  data  on  historical  losses  is  incomplete,  analysis  undertaken  under  the \nPCRAFI indicates that average annual losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis \nalone are equivalent to 2.9% of GDP in FSM, 2.0% of GDP in RMI, 3.0% of GDP in Solomon \nIslands, and 4.3% of GDP in Tonga. In addition, the four countries experience frequent droughts, \nfloods, storm surges, and, in some cases, volcanic eruptions. Examples of damage and loss from \ndisasters  in  the  participating  countries  include  Cyclone  Gita  in  2018,  which  caused  damage \nequivalent to 38% of GDP in Tonga; severe flooding in 2014, causing damage equivalent to 9% \nof GDP in Solomon Islands; Typhoon Maysak, causing losses equivalent to 4% of GDP in FSM; \nand severe drought in 2016 causing losses of 3% of GDP in RMI. The proposed financing per \ncountry  under  the  program  ranges  from  0.5%  to  3.0%  of  annual  GDP,  less than  the  cost  of  a \ntypical medium-impact disaster in the Pacific. \n \n28. \nThe governments have requested (i) grants not exceeding $6.0 million each for RMI, FSM, \nand Tonga and $3.0 million for Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (ADF); and \n(ii) a concessional loan of $3.0 million for Solomon Islands from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term  and  a  disbursement-linked \nrepayment schedule, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The indicative financing comprises resources from the concessional \nresources regional pool, countries\u2019 concessional lending and grant allocations; and, in the case \nof Tonga, from the ADF DRF (see Table 1). \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \n\n \n\nRMI \n\nFSM \n\n \n\nSOL \n  \n\nTonga \n  \n\nTotal \n  \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nAmount ($ million) \n\nCOL PBA (loan) \n\nCOL regional pool (loan) \n\nADF PBA (grant) \n\nADF regional pool (grant) \n\nADF DRF (grant) \n\nTotal \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n6 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n2 \n\n4 \n\n0 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n6 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n5 \n\n14 \n\n2 \n\n24 \n\n4.2 \n\n8.3 \n\n20.8 \n\n58.3 \n\n8.3 \n\n100.0 \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, COL = concessional ordinary capital resources loan, DRF = Disaster Response \nFacility, FSM = Federated States of Micronesia, RMI = Republic of the Marshall Islands, PBA = performance-based \nallocation, SOL = Solomon Islands. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n                                                \n25 Fiscal deficit and external financing figures are gross national income-weighted averages for the four countries. \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \nExecuting  agencies  will  be  the  ministry  of  finance  or  equivalent  in  each  country. 26 \n29. \nImplementing  agencies  will  include  ministries  responsible  for  finance,  planning,  infrastructure, \nclimate  change,  and  DRM.  Each  participating  DMC  has  country-specific  policy  actions  and \nseparate loan and/or grant agreements. The implementing agencies will implement the PPPF with \nthe support of DRM or climate change committees. The policy actions were implemented after \napproval of the program\u2019s Phase 1, from 1 January 2018 to 31 May 2019.27 The program will be \ncompleted on 31 March 2023, with a renewal option for a second 3-year period. Program renewal \nis  subject  to  reconfirmation  as  to  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic  environment,  including  an \nupdated International Monetary Fund assessment letter; DMCs\u2019 continued progress toward the \nPPPF;  and  an  updated  PPPF  with  mutually  agreed  objectives  for  the  subsequent  availability \nperiod. Renewal may also be affected by any changes to country classification during the program \nperiod.28 \n \n30. \nA withdrawal will be triggered after a government declares a state of disaster or emergency \nfollowing a natural hazard event in accordance with applicable law or practice.29 The government \ncan withdraw the loan and grant proceeds partially or entirely, depending on its assessment of \nthe disaster\u2019s severity and resultant need. Only a single withdrawal may be requested per disaster \nevent, and the request should be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \ndisaster or emergency.30 Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the grant and/or loan availability \nperiod can be disbursed to the respective participating countries under the deferred disbursement \noption,  subject  to  ADB  reconfirming  the  DMCs\u2019  continuation  of  policy  actions  and  the  PPPF \nthrough submission of a progress report. Funds will be spent through national budget processes \nfor eligible items.31 Proceeds of the policy-based loans and grants will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will \nperiodically  monitor  continuing  implementation  of  the  policy  actions  and  PPPF  during  the \navailability period. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n31. \nThe program is classified as category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous people. Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none \nof the activities will result in or lead to any physical works that could create environmental or social \nimpacts, physical or economic displacement,  or involuntary resettlement. The activities will not \nnegatively affect indigenous peoples. Stakeholder dialogue was carried out during the program \ndesign and will continue during implementation. The policy actions will improve the participating \ncountries\u2019 ability to maintain greater fiscal stability in the event of a disaster and to initiate relief \nand recovery efforts with minimum delay, thereby mitigating the immediate economic and social \nimpacts of a disaster. Implementation of the policy actions is expected to continue to strengthen \nexisting  social  protection  arrangements,  helping  to  ensure  that  communities  and  vulnerable \n                                                \n26 Ministry of Finance of RMI, Department of Finance and Administration of FSM, Ministry of Finance and Treasury of \n\nSolomon Islands, and Ministry of Finance of Tonga. \n\n27 Policy  actions  were  identified  and  their  implementation  encouraged  through  policy  dialogue,  which  has  been \n\nongoing since 2017 with some support from various ongoing TA. \n\n28 Footnote 8, paragraph 26. \n29 Government of RMI. 1987.

The  program  will  directly  benefit  women  by \nensuring gender  is  a  core  component  of  key  strategic  and  policy  documents.  National  climate \nchange strategies, emergency management plans, and sector policies (including the RMI National \nEnvironment  Management  Strategy,  Solomon  Islands  Greater  Honiara  Urban  Development \nStrategy and Action Plan, and the FSM National Energy  Master Plan) include gender analysis \nand actions. National strategies outline the importance of women\u2019s participation in DRM, include \nquotas to increase women\u2019s participation in decision-making, and commit to incorporate gender \nanalysis  in  all  stages  of  DRM  initiatives.  Actions  such  as  appointing  women  to  the  Solomon \nIslands  provincial  boards  and  ensuring  women  are  involved  in  disaster  and  climate  change \ncommittees  and  working groups  will  support  women\u2019s representation  in decision-making roles. \nThe  program  supports  gender-responsive  disaster  risk  financing  by  committing  to  gender-\nsensitive budgeting processes in NDC implementation plan (RMI) and ensuring that gender equity \nis a core guiding principle in strategies for accessing climate change financing (FSM).   \n \n33. \nCoordinating disaster responses, including the support offered by donors and civil society \norganizations with competing requirements and procedures, can pose significant administrative \nchallenges. Therefore, government absorption capacities are often stretched in the aftermath of \ndisaster events. The regional TA under Phase 1, which will be expanded to the new countries, is \nprioritizing  capacity  development  focused  on  financing  and  budgetary  issues,  including  post-\ndisaster budget allocation and execution, to ensure that all countries participating in the program \nhave  adequate  systems  in  place  to  use  program  resources  in  an  effective,  accountable,  and \ntransparent manner.  \n \nRisks  to  program  implementation  are  related  to  possible  external  shocks  on  the \n34. \neconomies  and  capacity  constraints  of the government  agencies,  including  constraints  in PFM \nsystems.  These  risks  will  be  managed  partially  through  support  for  capacity  development  of \ngovernment counterparts. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInsufficient action is taken on recommendations \nto improve financial management procedures \nfor disaster response.a \nExternal shocks (e.g., disasters and economic \ndownturns) damage the economies. \nGovernment agencies lack capacity to \nimplement the DRM actions. \nStaff constraints or shifting priorities delay \nimplementation of DRM actions. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe governments have actively strengthened PFM \nmore broadly, and the Phase 1 TA will provide \nsupport to address weaknesses identified in PFM. \nDevelopment partners support the governments to \nimprove resilience to economic shocks. \nThe Phase 1 TA and support from other partners will \ndevelop the capacity of government counterparts.  \nPeriodic monitoring is conducted to assess and \nreport on progress of the PPPF, and Phase 1 TA will \nsupport actions to further strengthen DRM. \n\nDRM = disaster risk management, PFM = public financial management, PPPF = post-program partnership framework, \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \na  Several  completed  plans  or  strategies  under  the  reform  areas  include  some  recommendations  on  financial \nmanagement procedures during disasters. \n                                                \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nThe Debt Sustainability Analysis for the Solomon Islands, the only country under Phase 2 \n35. \naccessing  loan  resources,  indicates  that  the  risk  of  external  debt  distress  remains  moderate, \nthough  it  notes  a  high  vulnerability  to  disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards. 33 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernments and executing agencies.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \nThe governments have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \n36. \nall  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting services,  and  disbursement as described in detail  in the  loan \nand grant agreements.
