THE PROPOSAL \n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project.1\nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Clean \nEnergy Fund (CEF), 2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, for the CAREC \nCorridors 2, 5, and 6 (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Road Project, and if the Board approves the\nproposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the grant. \n2. The proposed project will improve the connectivity between the capital Dushanbe and\nKurgonteppa, which are two major cities and economic hubs in Tajikistan.3 The road is a \nstrategic north\u2013south link, and one of the most heavily traveled roads in the country, as well as\nthe confluence of CAREC corridors 2, 5, and 6. \nII. THE PROJECT\nA.  Rationale \n3. Regional integration and transport infrastructure needs. Tajikistan is a landlocked\nmountainous country in Central Asia bordered by Afghanistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China,\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. Despite its strategic location, the country has a gross \ndomestic product per capita of just $1,037, and 35% of the population still lived below the \npoverty line in 2013. Almost 70% of the population lives in rural areas, in a largely mountainous \nterritory (90%), where only 10% of the land is suitable for cultivation. Tajikistan heavily depends \non transport corridors to support investment, job creation, trade, and ultimately economic growth \nand poverty reduction. The road transport sector suffers from low quality, long travel times, and \npoor reliability, which hinder the country\u2019s economic growth. Four CAREC regional corridors\n(2, 3, 5, and 6) cross parts of Tajikistan, offering a great opportunity for Tajikistan to enhance its \nconnectivity and trade competitiveness.  \n4. Inadequate road connectivity, efficiency, and safety. The 27,000 kilometers (km)\nroad network was largely constructed before the 1970s, and the rapid increase of traffic in some \narterial roads is intensifying pressure on aging transport infrastructure. Tajikistan has limited \nlinks to neighboring countries, especially Afghanistan and the People\u2019s Republic of China. The\noverall condition of the road network is relatively poor, which is due in part to the initial poor \ndesign  and  quality  of  construction,  as  well  as  inadequate  subsequent  maintenance  of \npavements and structures. Funding for routine and periodic road maintenance has increased \nsteadily from TJS30.3 million in 2009 to TJS60.5 million in 2016. Yet, there is a funding gap to \nmeet network maintenance needs. The lack of a road asset management system compounds \nthe problem, thus the need to optimize the allocation of funds based on needs and functions. \nThe road safety record in Tajikistan is dismal despite its low level of vehicle ownership (about 50 \nvehicles per 1,000 people). The World Health Organization estimates that there were 1,543 \nfatalities in 2013, which corresponds to 18.8 fatalities per 100,000 people. The transport system \nneeds  to  be  planned  and  operated  to  reduce  road  safety  crashes.  A  better  road  asset \nmanagement is needed to maintain the network in good serviceable condition and provide a \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the CAREC Corridors 2, \n5, and 6 Road (Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa) Project (TA 8945-TAJ).", "2 \nreliable  service  throughout  the  year  to  support  Tajikistan\u2019s  internal  and  external  trade\ncompetitiveness. \n5. Road sector achievements and lessons. The road network under MOT jurisdiction\ntotals 13,968 km, comprising 3,178 km of international roads (23%), 2,120 km of national roads \n(15%), and 8,670 km of local roads (62%). The backbone of Tajikistan\u2019s national road network\nhas been largely improved with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners.4 ADB investments in the transport sector improved about 810 km of \nCAREC roads and 350 km of rural roads, introduced pilot projects on  performance-based \nmaintenance,  raised  awareness  regarding  road  safety,  and  reduced  cross-border  barriers. \nLessons from previous projects were incorporated into the design of this project, including giving \nspecific attention to project readiness, and developing systems and capacity regarding financial \nmanagement, road safety, and road asset management. \n6. Government sector strategy and plans. The development of the transport sector is\nguided by the government\u2019s National Development Strategy and the Transport Sector Master\nPlan,5 and implemented through the State Program on Transport Sector Development, 2010\u2013\n2025. The Transport Sector Master Plan, developed with ADB assistance, is the basis for the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic sector planning; as such it provides a framework for coordination among\ngovernment  bodies  and  development  partners.  The  State  Program  on  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment includes a list of short-, medium-, and long-term investments that is regularly \nreviewed and updated. The size of the ADB transport sector program, coupled with its leading \nrole  in  the  CAREC  transport  program,  has  positioned  ADB  to  successfully  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s sector strategies, policies, and plans.\n7. Progressive  improvement  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road. The government\nhas  requested  ADB  assistance  to  improve  portions  of  CAREC  corridors  2,  5,  and  6  by \nupgrading  the  82  km  Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa  road,  for  which  ADB  has  programmed  two\nprojects in 2016 and 2018 as presented in the Tajikistan country operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018.6 The project road passes through terrain that varies from flat to mountainous, and\nconnects Dushanbe to Afghanistan. The first project will focus on improving an approximately \n33 km section of the road from Dushanbe to Chashmasoron, hereinafter referred to as the \nproject road. Financing of the second project, from Chashmasoron to Kurgonteppa, may be \nconsidered through additional financing subject to satisfactory progress on the first project. \n8. Improving the road is a government priority, as reflected by its inclusion in the National\nDevelopment Strategy, and its consistency with the ADB country partnership strategy.7 The \nproject is also consistent with the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020 and \nwill contribute to achieving goals 3 (good health and well-being) and 9 (industry, innovation, and \ninfrastructure) of the Sustainable Development Goals.8  \n9. The project area. Dushanbe is the capital and largest city in Tajikistan, with 775,000\nresidents. Kurgonteppa is the capital of the Khatlon region and the third-largest city in Tajikistan, \nwith a population of about 100,000. Kurgonteppa is home to a number of industrial enterprises, \n4 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5 Government of Tajikistan. 2007.

Except  for  a  3.4  km  section  immediately  south  of \nDushanbe, the project road has two lanes, with few safety features. It could serve as a powerful \nengine for regional integration and inclusive economic growth, but this potential is limited by \nthree factors: road capacity, condition, and safety. In addition, during the winter season when \nglacial melt is at its lowest and energy demand the highest, villages and facilities along the \nproject  area  experience  frequent  energy  cuts,  which  affect  road  safety,  restrict  economic \nactivities, and increase domestic hardship, especially for women. \n10. Transforming local challenges into national opportunities. The project will support\nthe government\u2019s program to progressively improve the road by (i) expanding its width from two \nto four lanes to address impending capacity constraints, (ii) improving its surface condition \nthrough construction of a new pavement, and (iii) providing well-designed safety facilities to \naddress existing road safety deficiencies. The project will introduce clean energy technologies\u2014\nsuch as solar street lighting and solar-based backup systems\u2014to enhance power reliability and\nefficiency along the project road. This will contribute to improved living standards in the villages \nalong the project road, and to reduced carbon dioxide emissions. \n11. The project will also develop guidelines on safe arterial road design and initiate the\ndevelopment  of  a  tailored  road  asset  management  system,  with  a  view  to  incrementally \nstrengthening MOT capacity in these areas. This approach will support a continued policy \ndialogue that will run parallel with progressive improvement of the road, and will be closely \ncoordinated with other development partners active in the transport sector. \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n12. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) the strategic pillar on promotion\nof economic growth of the Tajikistan National Development Strategy, and (ii) CAREC\u2019s strategic \ngoal  of  establishing  competitive  corridors  across  the  CAREC  region. The  outcome  will  be \nimproved efficiency and safer movement of goods and people on selected sections of the \nDushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road.\nC.  Outputs \n13. The outputs will be (i) improved road conditions, facilities, and safety along, and in the\nvicinity of, the project road (33 km); 9 (ii) strengthened institutional capacity of MOT regarding \nfinancial  management,  road  safety,  and  road  asset  management;  and  (iii)  completed \nprocurement readiness for the next section of the road to be improved, from Chashmasoron to \nKurgonteppa. \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n14. The project is estimated to cost $96.4 million (Table 1).\n9 Includes provision of road signs, pedestrian crossings, road lighting, livestock underpasses, bus stops, and \nimprovement of rest areas and road bazaars.

The  government  has  requested  (i)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to\nSDR35,289,000; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $15.8 million, both from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources, to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the financing agreements. \n16. The government has also requested the OPEC Fund for International Development\n(OFID) to provide a loan of $12 million, which will finance exclusively a part of the civil works of \nthe project road. The OFID loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nand an interest rate of 2.75% per annum inclusive of a 1.00% service charge. ADB and OFID \nwill  cofinance  the  civil  works  of  the  project  as  collaborative  cofinancing.  ADB  will  not  be \nadministering the OFID loan and each cofinancier will manage, in close coordination, its own \npro rata share of disbursements for civil works-related payments. \n17. In addition, the CEF (footnote 2) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility\nwill provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $2 million, to be administered by ADB, to integrate \nclean energy and energy efficiency technologies for street lighting and power backup systems \nfor  communities  living  adjacent  to  the  project  road.  This  grant  will  also  finance  lighting \nimprovement in the Ozodi tunnel on the Dushanbe\u2013Dangara road to ensure that lighting is\navailable on a 24-hour basis. ADB will fully administer the CEF grant on a parallel cofinancing \nbasis.  By  virtue  of  the  CEF  cofinancing,  universal  procurement  will  generally  apply  to \nprocurement  and  consulting  services  packages  to  be  financed  under  the  project.10 The \ngovernment will provide counterpart funding of $17.2 million equivalent to cover taxes and \nduties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, incremental administrative expenses, and other \nmiscellaneous costs. \n10 ADB. 2013.

The  MOT  and  PIURR  have \nimplemented 10 ADB-financed road projects since 2000. The PIURR will be assisted during \nproject implementation by relevant MOT departments and the project management and contract \nsupervision consultant (PMCSC). \n20. The civil works contract will be supervised by the PMCSC, which will be the engineer for\nthe contract as defined in the contract documentation. The scope of the PMCSC services will \ninclude design review, construction supervision, environment and resettlement monitoring, road \nsafety  audits,  financial  management  support,  and  advance  procurement  activities  for  the \nproposed subsequent project. Two individual consultants will be recruited to support the PIURR \nin designing and procuring the solar power systems. \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE\nA.  Technical \n22. Present traffic volumes range from approximately 7,000\u201310,000 vehicles per day in the\ncenter section of the road to around 16,000 vehicles per day in the peri-urban sections on the \noutskirts of Dushanbe and Kurgonteppa. The road is projected to reach its capacity as a two-\nlane facility by 2020 for most of its length. Although its surface is on average in reasonable \ncondition, with an average international roughness index (IRI) of around 6, this figure masks \nseveral significant sections where the pavement is deteriorating rapidly. Some sections of the \nroad that were reconstructed under a previous ADB project have the lowest IRI, about 4 on \naverage.12 Overall, the road pavement requires improvement, either immediately or in the near \nto medium term, due to the emergence of cracking and potholes and damage to structures and \ndrainage  systems.  The  road  also  has  a  poor  safety  record,  with  a  high  concentration  of \naccidents in the more heavily trafficked sections adjacent to Dushanbe and Kurgonteppa. \n23. The completed road will have two carriageways, each with two traffic lanes 3.5 meters\nwide, separated by a median typically 3.0 meters wide in rural areas and narrower where the \nroad passes through villages and difficult mountain terrain. This complies with the Tajikistan \nstandard for roads of this category, and with Asian Highway standards. Since the existing two-\nlane  road  will  reach  capacity  within  5  years,  the  proposed  double  carriageway  four-lane \nconfiguration is appropriate. The project road alignment will follow the existing road alignment \nbecause of terrain considerations and to minimize land acquisition, with some adjustments to \nhorizontal  and  vertical  alignments  to  meet  the  required  standards.  The  design  speed  will \ntypically be 100 km per hour, which is appropriate for a road of this class in the terrain through \nwhich it passes. \n24. The completed road will have a flexible pavement with asphaltic concrete surfacing\n(average  IRI  of  2).  The  pavement  structure  has  been  designed  using  appropriate  design \nmethods based on the traffic projected to use the road over a 20-year period (2021\u20132040)\nfollowing project completion, assuming two asphaltic concrete overlays during this period to \nprovide the additional strength required for traffic loading for the latter part of the road\u2019s service \nlife.  The  road  design  takes  into  account  the  severe  weather  conditions  that  the  road  will \nexperience,  which  range from  high temperatures  in  summer  to  below freezing  with  heavy \nsnowfall  in  winter.  Relevant  disaster  risks  and  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation \n12 ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to \nthe Republic of Tajikistan for the Road Rehabilitation Project. Manila. ", "7 \nmeasures have also been factored into the design (drainage structures, slope stability, and solar \nstreet lighting). \n25. The road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in terms of road\nsafety.  The  design  will  be  subjected  to  detailed  road  safety  audits  before  construction \ncommences, during construction, and prior to final acceptance of the completed road. The road \ndesign also reflects consultations with communities living adjacent to the road, as a result of \nwhich several underpasses for people, livestock, and agriculture; pedestrian crossings with \nappropriate warning devices; and other community-relevant facilities will be provided. \n26. This technical due diligence has confirmed that the project\u2019s technical design, alignment,\ncross-section, drainage structures, pavements, and road safety are appropriate for a road in this \nlocation, and for the volume of traffic that is projected to use it. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27. Economic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using the\nhighway development and management model, and following ADB guidelines.13 For the purpose \nof the economic analysis, the with-project scenario assumed the improvement of the 33.2 km \nDushanbe\u2013Chashmasoron road section. Without the project, the road is expected to deteriorate\nto an average IRI value of 16 within 15 years, rendering it unmaintainable. Future traffic was \nestimated based on classified traffic counts conducted in 2016, and available gross domestic \nproduct  growth  forecasts.  The  project  is  economically  viable  with  an  estimated  economic \ninternal rate of return of 23.5%, with a net present value of $90 million at a 12.0% discount rate. \nThe principal quantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs, reduced travel time, and \nreduced maintenance costs. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the economic viability of the project \nis robust against project cost increases of up to 187%, and decreases in vehicle operating costs \nsavings of up to 71%. \n28. Financial  sustainability. The project is non-revenue generating. The design of the\nproject road pavement and structures has been carefully developed with a view to ensuring the \nroad\u2019s long-term sustainability. The project will initiate the development of a tailored road asset\nmanagement system in close coordination with other development partners (e.g., the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the \nWorld  Bank),  all  of  which  have  operations  that  involve  some  forms  of  operation  and \nmaintenance. The government is committed to maintaining the project road and facilities at the \nrequired standard as reflected in the financing agreement. The financial analysis concluded that \nMOT has sufficient financial capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, to meet\nrecurrent expenditures to operate and maintain the project road in a sustainable manner. \nC.  Governance \n29. Financial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was undertaken\nin accordance with ADB guidelines regarding project financial management (footnote 13) and \nfinancial due diligence.14 The FMA considered the PIURR\u2019s capacity with regard to funds-flow\narrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems,  financial  information \nsystems, and internal and external auditing arrangements.

The FMA concluded that the overall financial management risk of the \nimplementing agency is substantial. \n30. Procurement.  The  MOT  and  PIURR  have  an  adequate  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s\nprocurement and financial management policies and procedures as a result of the  sizable \nportfolio  of  ADB-supported  operations  in  Tajikistan.  A  procurement  risk  assessment  was \nundertaken and considered the PIURR\u2019s capacity with regard to organization and staffing,\ninformation  management,  procurement  practices,  complaints  and  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms,  and  accountability  measures.  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  overall \nprocurement management risk of the implementing agency is low to moderate. \n31. The PMCSC team includes an international financial management specialist, a national\nfinancial management specialist, and an international procurement specialist, who will assist the \nPIURR in implementing key actions and measures to address the deficiencies identified in the \nFMA and procurement risk assessment. \n32. ADB\u2019s Integrity Principles and Guidelines15 and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as\namended to date) were explained to and discussed with the government, the MOT, and the \nPIURR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM (footnote 11). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33. The project will directly benefit residents in Dushanbe and 19 villages located along the\nproject road by improving access to jobs, markets, and public services while reducing the \nlikelihood  and  severity  of  road  collisions.  The  project  will  also  enhance  the  reliability  and \nefficiency of power solutions along the project road by introducing solar-based street lighting \nand backup systems for communities living adjacent to the project road. Socioeconomic surveys \nwere carried out for project preparation and a summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nwas prepared.16 \n34. The gender categorization of the project is some gender elements. The project design\nwill address some of the factors that inhibit female mobility by increasing safety features (road \nsigns and street lighting), enhancing connectivity of villages (pedestrian crossings and livestock \nunderpasses), constructing bus stops, improving rest areas and road bazaars, and promoting \nconfidence  in  the  new  road  configuration  through  road  safety-awareness  training  and \nworkshops. The MOT and PIURR will take all necessary actions to encourage women living in \nthe project area to participate in planning and implementing project activities following the \nprinciples of the ADB Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \nE.  Safeguards \n35. Resettlement. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement impacts.\nDue to the linear design and limited number of agricultural plots located along the project road, \nthe impacts will not be significant. The census carried out during project preparation identified \napproximately 74 affected households\u2014including private agriculture plots, owners and users of\nland and buildings, business owners, renters, and employees\u2014with 609 household members\n15 ADB. 2015. Integrity Principles and Guidelines. Manila. \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \naffected. Only six land plots will lose more than 10% of their area. One residential building and \nfour main business buildings will be permanently impacted. A land acquisition and resettlement \nplan (LARP) has been prepared to mitigate and address all the associated losses in accordance \nwith the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and relevant national legislation.17 The LARP \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in August 2016. Consultations with the project stakeholders \nand displaced persons were undertaken in the course of LARP preparation, and will continue \nthroughout  implementation.  If  modification  of  the  LARP  is  required,  or  additional  land \nrequirement  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  identified,  the  LARP  will  be  updated  in \naccordance  with  applicable  laws,  and  ADB  approval  obtained  prior  to  any  further \nimplementation. All displaced people will receive compensation in accordance with the LARP \nprovisions. The land will be made free of encumbrances in sections prior to commencement of \nconstruction. A grievance redress mechanism is in place in accordance with the LARP to assist \naffected persons in resolving grievances and complaints. The MOT will submit semiannual \nsafeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. \n36. Environment. The project is classified category B for environmental impacts. An initial\nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) have been prepared \nfor the project and were disclosed on the ADB website in August 2016, in accordance with the \nADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. 18  Public  consultations  were  conducted  during  initial \nenvironmental  examination  preparation,  and  involved  people  from  roadside  villages, \nnongovernment organizations, and other project stakeholders. The environmental assessment \nestablished that the project will have site-specific environmental impacts related to air and water \npollution, noise and vibration, soil erosion, loss of roadside trees, relocation of utilities, and \ntraffic disruption during the construction stage. Additionally, it was found that the project could \nresult  in  split  communities,  disruption  of farming  patterns,  and  loss of  access  to  roadside \nbusinesses  during  operation.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  included  in,  and  will  be \nimplemented  through,  the  EMP.  The  project  design  incorporates  measures  for  preserving \ncommunity cohesion such as improved road crossings, access to public facilities, and access of \nagricultural machinery to fields and livestock to pastures. The cost for implementing the EMP \nwill be financed by the project through the civil works contract (mitigation measures) and the \nPMCSC\u2019s contract (environmental monitoring).\n37. Indigenous  peoples.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples,  as  defined  in  the  ADB\nSafeguard Policy Statement, in the project area, and thus the project is classified category C for \nindigenous peoples impacts. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail\nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.19 The  project  risks  are  considered \nmanageable through the prescribed mitigating measures.
